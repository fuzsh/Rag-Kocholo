        "text": "Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco. Having known misfortune myself, I am learning to help those in distress (Virgil, Aeneid, 1. 630). Dido speaks these words to Aeneas upon his arrival in Carthage after his many wanderings after escaping the destruction of Troy. Misfortune makes us grow up fast. At twenty, you can have had more than your fair share of adversity and know more about life than someone twice your age. Personal tragedy opens your eyes to the pain of others. Their crosses and sorrows, if you let them, can change your life, making you aware of some of the world’s limitless misery, which millions must endure without consolation because they have no other choice.\n\nWhy do some individuals, at great inconvenience to themselves, give up their comfortable middle-class lives and travel to poor countries as doctors, nurses, and missionaries to minister to sick and suffering human beings, who would otherwise have no one to care for them? How do you explain such heroic sacrifice?\n\nUbicumque homo est, ibi beneficii locus est. Where there is a human being, there is a chance to do good (Seneca, On the Happy Life, 24. 3). There are some who feel surrounded by the sacred and mysterious silence of the universe. They are never selective in helping others, but care for every human being and creature in pain. They don’t look upon such work as their “job,” but their “calling,” their “vocation,” a state of inner beatitude that enfolds them.\n\nThe names of giants like Albert Schweitzer and Dorothy Day come readily to mind. If you want to be inspired by real dedication to a cause that borders on the sublime about helping “thy neighbor,” you could do no better than acquainting yourself with these towering individuals: Dorothy Day’s autobiography, The Long Loneliness and, of course, Schweitzer’s Reverence for Life.\n\nBeneficium non in eo quod fit aut datur consistit, sed in ipso dantis aut facientis animo. Goodness lies not in the deed, but in the intention (Seneca, On Benefits, 1. 6. 1). If you intend to harm people and, without meaning to, wind up helping them and are lionized as a great philanthropist, have you done a good deed? If you intend to help people and, without meaning to, wind up harming them, have you done a bad deed?\n\nIf you’re a multi-millionaire and build a hospital wing on condition that no one knows who donated the money, and someone else does the same thing but wants the wing named after himself and insists on media coverage, have you both done a good deed? However, is one deed better than the other? Is it the deed, the intention with which it is done, or its consequences that determine whether that deed is good?\n\nYou sometimes hear that it doesn’t matter why someone does a good deed, but just be grateful that such a deed is done. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, but simply accept the deed when offered and not be concerned with the motive of the person doing it. Others think that motive makes all the difference in the world. They’d like to think that someone helping them has no ulterior motive in mind, but that it was a purely selfless act. If you sensed that someone were helping you for a self-serving reason, would it matter?\n\nHomo qui in homine calamitoso est misericors meminit sui. Compassion puts oneself in another’s place (Publilius Syrus, Maxims, 243). Compassion can be a dangerous thing. When it’s taught in the classroom it can become a Damascus moment. Teaching about slavery by having students imagine scenes in the lives of slaves, what they had to endure, how it made them feel — the humiliations, the whippings, the inhumanity and degradation, and the separation of families, can be extraordinarily emotional experiences.\n\nHaving students silently internalize what they see and feel as their teacher slowly talks them through such scenes and asks them simply to identify with the suffering of these helpless human beings at the mercy of their heartless masters could change the lives of students. Is it possible that for this reason this kind of role-play might be forbidden in schools in certain parts of our country today?\n\nSic in inferiore vivas, quemadmodum tecum superiorem velis vivere. Treat your subordinate as you would have your superior treat you (Seneca, Moral Letters, 47. 11). Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This is an invitation to explore through role-play how someone else feels. The swiftest way to becoming a moral person is becoming a compassionate person who feels, for it is feelings, not ideas, that transform and educate us; feelings that bore into our very essence and permit us to feel the pain of what every living creature — human and animal — endures.\n\nIf someone, on the other hand, is a very cold person and approaches everything in terms of ideas alone, there are many things about life they will never understand unless they are able to feel them. It’s not ideas that educate us, but the feelings that accompany those ideas that open us up to the misery in the world.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that the cultivation of feelings in education is so important, and why reading and discussing novels and plays, short stories and poems in class are so indispensable to an education of becoming a compassionate and complete human being? Literature touches the transcendent when it teaches us to feel and to identify with the suffering of our fellow creatures lest we knowingly or unknowingly add to their suffering.\n\nThinking is important in protecting us against the machinations of the world, but the ability to feel, and to feel deeply, is very important. This is especially true of some boys, who either lose their capacity to feel, ignore their feelings as “signs of weakness,” or despise them as beneath contempt and unworthy of a male. They may be too young to realize that it’s feelings that make us human, and that intellect alone, divorced from all feeling, can make us inhuman.\n\nIf you don’t want people to feel, describe what is happening in abstract or theoretical terms. They won’t feel a thing, but if you want them to understand which is really going on, express the same event in ways that will make them feel, in flesh and blood terms, and they could be transformed on the spot. Having students feel their way through a particular scene of a play is sometimes better than reading a learned treatise that explains the action.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why Standardized Testing is so pernicious in today’s schools since it discourages feeling except that of boredom on the part of students and outrage on the part of their teachers who are made complicit in this miseducation of American children. There is no time to discuss ideas and the emotional reactions which those ideas give rise to as is only natural when discussing great literature rather than brief outtakes to prepare for tests and trivialize what a classroom experience should be about.\n\nWhen, O Lord, wilt Thou deliver us from these “reformster” practitioners of lobotomized mindlessness imposed by politicians and legislatures in the pay of testing companies to force-feed students their toxic brew instead of letting teachers get on with conducting old-fashioned discussions about what a story is saying about life.\n\nUt absolvaris, ignosce. Forgive, if you want forgiveness (Seneca, On Benefits, 7. 28. 3). Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Or in the vernacular, we ask to be forgiven only if we are also willing to forgive those who have wronged us. One is contingent upon the other. Cast all ill-will from your heart, and all will be well.\n\nThe Greek view of the ethical life had a tremendous impact on the Romans. Moreover, it is an interesting contrast to that of the Bible’s. A different tone and mood pervade the following Greek aphorisms than what one finds in the Old and New Testaments. More significantly, the motivation for leading an ethical life is worlds apart from biblical morality.\n\nGreek aphorisms are surrounded by a profound silence which invites the reader to think about the implications of what is being said. There is no emotion in the language employed, but simply an appeal to the mind for quiet reflection, the only portal one can enter to move beyond the marbled words to the pulsating humanity behind them.\n\nStudents had already been exposed to the Greek mind and sensibility during the first nine weeks of the course when they studied Edith Hamilton’s classic, The Greek Way, supplemented with interpretations by Johann Winckelmann, Jacob Burckhardt, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Gilbert Murray, Werner Jaeger, and Pierre Hadot, as well as extensive training in critical thinking throughout the initial nine weeks of the course.\n\nIn this assignment I asked students to discuss three questions: the difference between the Greek and biblical motivation for an ethical life; the strengths and weaknesses of each motivational system; and the student’s opinion about which system would be more effective in motivating ethical behavior.\n\nWith respect to the third question, it didn’t matter which system was chosen; what mattered was the cogency of the reasons for choosing it. For extra credit, a student could argue the opposite case as well.\n\nEpictetus\n\nWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\n\nWhat matters isn’t what happens, but how you react to what happens.\n\nThere is only one way to happiness — cease worrying about the things which are beyond our control.\n\nCircumstances don’t make the man, but only reveal him to himself.\n\nWho is rich?

The trials we endure introduce us to our strengths.\n\nPlato\n\nThe greatest wealth is to live content with little.\n\nPeople can either nourish you and help you grow as a person, or stunt your growth and make you wilt and die.\n\nBe as you wish to appear.\n\nThe body is a tomb.\n\nEmploy your time in improving yourself by other men’s writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.\n\nWorthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.\n\nGood people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around them.\n\nBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\n\nWe can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\n\nLet parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence.\n\nThe first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.\n\nNo evil can befall a good man, either in life or after death.\n\nNo one knows whether death, which people fear as the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.\n\nThe unexamined life is not worth living.\n\nGood actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others.\n\nRiches can never make a bad man at peace with himself.\n\nGod knows best what is good for us.\n\nWe cannot be better than in seeking to become better.\n\nAristotle\n\nKnowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.\n\nEducating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.\n\nTo avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.\n\nThe antidote for fifty enemies is one friend.\n\nMisfortune shows those who are not really one’s friends.\n\nTime crumbles things; everything grows old under the power of Time and is forgotten over the passage of time.\n\nIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\n\nMan is a goal-seeking animal. His life only has meaning if he is reaching out and striving toward his goals.\n\nThe aim of the wise is not to secure pleasure, but to avoid pain.\n\nThe ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.\n\nYouth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.\n\nThe young are permanently in a state resembling intoxication.\n\nThe young have exalted notions because they have not been humbled by life or learned its necessary limitations.\n\nWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not one act, but a habit.\n\nThe educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead.\n\nPoverty is the parent of revolution and crime.\n\nPlato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.\n\nDemocritus\n\nHappiness does not dwell in herds of cattle or in gold.\n\nBy desiring little, a poor man makes himself rich.\n\nOne must compare one’s own life with that of those in worse situations, and consider oneself fortunate, reflecting on their sufferings and being so much better off than they.\n\nVirtue consists not in avoiding wrongdoing, but not even wanting to do wrong.\n\nDo not say or do what is base, even when you are alone.\n\nCourage makes misfortunes small.\n\nEpicurus\n\nWe must free ourselves from the prison of everyday affairs and politics.\n\nIt is useless to ask the gods for what one can obtain for oneself.\n\nIt is better to be free of fear and lying on a bed of straw than to own a couch of gold and a lavish table and yet have no peace of mind.\n\nLive your life without attracting attention.\n\nEuripides\n\nModeration is the noblest gift of heaven.\n\nThis is courage in man — to bear unflinchingly what heaven sends.\n\nHappiness is brief.\n\nThe designs of heaven are indeed frightening and inscrutable.\n\nTime will show what you are.\n\nTake heart.

Virtue is the mid-point between two opposite vices (Horace, Epistles, 1. 18. 9). See below for class discussion.\n\nThree Ethical Discussions on Applying the Golden Mean to Modern Life\n\n[The First Day]\n\nTeacher: The Greeks believed that the ideal of moderation, the Golden Mean, or “Nothing in Excess,” should characterize everything about being human. What was most important in life was maintaining a healthy balance in everything by avoiding extremes and keeping to “the middle way.” Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics felt that even the virtues should be no exception. Virtue was “midway between two opposite vices.” Courage, for example, was midway between the two extremes of cowardice and recklessness.\n\nWhat I’d like to do today and the next two days is to extend this way of thinking to other areas of our lives to see if the Greeks can teach us anything useful about being human in the 21st century. Take a few minutes and choose one of the following concepts and describe three different states of mind: first, someone who embodies a balanced view of that concept; then someone who carries that concept to an extreme; and, lastly, someone who embodies the opposite extreme by having no regard for that concept at all. Three points of view, then: one which is balanced; one which is excessive; and one which is deficient.\n\nAcceptance by Others, Ambition, Being in Control, Commitment, Concern for Others, Conformity, Duty, Enthusiasm, Expressing One’s Feelings, Family, Fitness, Friends, Fun, Hope, Humility, Ideals, Imagination, Inner Life, Knowledge, Love, Loyalty, Needing Others, Oneself, Patriotism, Personal Freedom, Popularity, Possessions, Religion, Reputation, Resignation, Self-Acceptance, Self-Confidence, Self-Discipline, Sense of One’s Limitations, Sports, Success, Tradition, Trust, and Virtue.\n\nStudent 1: I’d like to talk about “success.” I think a balanced view of success, one that’s not fanatical, on the one hand, or totally absent, on the other, would be working hard for a goal in a way that would bring you a sense of fulfillment and pride in proving yourself and feeling good about what you’ve accomplished.\n\nThe extreme would be doing anything to be Number One. That’s all you think about every waking moment. You’re so focused on that goal that you’ll neglect everything else in your life as a needless distraction that would keep you from reaching the top of that mountain.\n\nBeing Number Two is being a failure and, as a result, being so ashamed that you can’t live with yourself, so you use that shame to try even harder the next time. You’ll do anything to get that prize. Nothing else matters — your marriage, your family, even having a life. You’ll sacrifice everything. You’ll even sell out your friends to reach the next rung on the ladder, and then you’ll discard them for new “friends” to help you reach the next rung.\n\nYou don’t care whom you hurt because everyone is just a means to your end. What may have started out as a normal desire to do your best gradually turns into a sickness, a mania, a kind of psychosis where you become a slave to this inner compulsion that won’t let you go.\n\nThe opposite extreme is having no interest in being a success at all. You just do your own thing and refuse to take part in anything because you have your own agenda. You’re not a “go-getter” or an “alpha type” since you don’t want to get involved in a “rat race” that’s not worth the effort. You just want to be left alone to go your own way.\n\nTeacher: Okay. Nice job. Reactions?\n\nStudent 2: I just wanted to comment on that last point about not wanting any parts of that “rat race.” I have a lot of friends like that, but I don’t think they fit the category about not striving for success. True, they’re more easy-going, laid-back, and would do anything for you, but they just define success in a different way.\n\nThey also have focus, but not as an over-the-top kind of person who’d even run over his grandmother if she got in his way. [Laughter] These guys just want to be left alone to do their own thing. They just define their goals differently and, whatever they do, they want to be good at it, but just enough to be happy and not go off the deep end or go down in any Guinness Book of Records.\n\nStudent 3: If I could offer another example that might be more in keeping with someone who has no interest in success about anything, it would be someone who’s basically a slug, with no motivation, incentive or energy, almost catatonic, and who simply vegetates his life away. They could be loners, but not necessarily, because a lot of loners have volcanic drive and focus, but they don’t show it in any overt way. The person I’m talking about might be depressed, or maybe something happened to him early in life. Maybe there’s something going on at home, or he’s dealing with some kind of inner problem or tragedy, and is so preoccupied with it that all of his energy is siphoned off by dwelling on himself.\n\nStudent 4: I’d like to get back to the guy who ran over his grandmother. [Laughter] I think the way he was described really hits the nail on the head, but I don’t think that these people think that they are over-the-top at all. In fact, they think that everyone who’s not like them is a slug! I think that they’re very good at whatever they do, and that this is just their way of showing it and getting recognition. They’re so driven that they’re blind to how they come across to others. Or they could be aware of it, but simply can’t help themselves or don’t care because they’re so trapped in their mindset 24/7 that they’re on a permanent high.\n\nTeacher: Okay, good comments. I want to start digging a bit deeper now. Beyond what’s already been said, what might be going on with this person who will stop at nothing to be a success? [Long pause]\n\nStudent 5: Well, he might have some kind of inferiority complex, so that the lengths he’ll go to are simply a way of proving to others that he’s not only okay, but exceptional. Probably overcompensating, too, but doesn’t realize how much he’s hurting himself in the long run by becoming so one-sided and warped in the process.\n\nStudent 6: I don’t think people like that care about what other people think of them. Sort of missing a gene or something, because all they care about is success-at-any-price and nothing about how they might hurt others so long as they come out on top. It’s like those guys who bulk up on steroids, not caring about how it’s undermining their health as long as they win!\n\nThey just slowly go mad because they’re so possessed by this inner demon and just don’t care about wrecking their bodies. They figure, even if I die, it’s a small price to pay for being Number One! Really sick! Those who know them probably sense they need professional help, but hesitate to get involved because they know they’ll never change, so they write them off as a lost cause.\n\nStudent 7: I think we may be approaching this the wrong way. My older brother majored in sociology in college and once mentioned that American culture itself probably has a lot to do with this craziness. It’s the way it pushes success to an extreme where it’s almost pathological. Everybody wants to be an entrepreneur, a risk-taker, take all sorts of chances, so that it pushes them over the edge. It’s a social madness that gets in the bloodstream and makes people into over-competitive fanatics like Willy Loman or Gatsby le Magnifique\n\nTeacher: Interesting comments. Anyone else? Now, what about the other extreme, the person who’s just very passive, with no interest in anything? Is there anything beyond what’s already been said that might explain this behavior?\n\nStudent 8: I think it’s a fear of failure or being laughed at, so to avoid that, they don’t do anything that could expose themselves to criticism. They just shut down to play it safe and let life pass them by. Why they fear failing so much, I have no idea. After all, everybody fails at some time in their life, and when they do, they just get back on that horse and try once again. But something got to these people early in life, so that when they do fail, they think it’s the end of the world!\n\nOr maybe they’re perfectionists, and if they can’t do something perfectly, they go to pieces and withdraw from life. Whatever it is, it just feeds on itself and they feel themselves even more of a failure because they’re going round and round and end up loathing themselves because they don’t even try. But even if they wanted to, they’d be afraid to break out of their circle without drawing attention to themselves by trying, and so they retreat even more deeply into themselves and give up completely.\n\nTeacher: If this person were your friend, what would you say to help him?\n\nStudent 8: Well, I pretty much feel that they’d already know what I’d say, but I’d still say it because, coming from a friend, it might strike a chord and make them realize that someone does understand and cares enough to want to help them. I think that showing your concern might begin to thaw them out, so that they might want to come out of their shell. Everything would naturally depend on their willingness to try.\n\nYou could talk them through it and be there for them, telling them that everyone fails, but the trick is not to let it get to them, and that, since they’re still young, it isn’t as though they’re set in concrete. When you’re young, you haven’t earned the right yet to give up! It would take a lot of work, but if they’re your friend, you don’t mind because they are your friend.\n\nTeacher: Very nice discussion with lots of interesting points. Just a few closing thoughts. This notion of moderation is mentioned so often in Greek antiquity that you get the impression that the Greeks were preaching to themselves. Even the myth about Icarus, who flies too high toward the sun and falls to his death, conveys the same message.\n\nWhy stress something like moderation or the Golden Mean unless you felt that there was a need for stressing it because so many weren’t observing it? And if that were the case, at least they’d realize that they had a problem and were trying to correct it by these constant reminders. This very recognition of having a problem and taking steps to overcome it is itself an impressive quality and shows that they weren’t into denial, but willing to look Medusa in the face and deal with the problem.\n\nAs you go through life, look for other examples of people not observing the Golden Mean. This is not to say that the Mean must be located dead-center between two opposite extremes. There’s naturally going to be some flexibility because we’re all different and we have to make allowance for these differences. Where the Mean is for one person may not be the same for another.\n\nWhat will strike you, however, is when someone is at either extreme of the spectrum. When this happens, ask yourself what would be the balanced way of behaving? And picking up on a point raised in our discussion, do you think that there is a high incidence of extreme behavior in our culture today, and, if so, is it caused by our culture itself and the times we live in? [Pause] See you tomorrow!”\n\nFrank Breslin is a retired high-school teacher in the New Jersey public school system."
