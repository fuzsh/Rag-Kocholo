        "text": "The foundation of the Instituto di Correspondenza Archeologica in Rome in 1829 provided an international centre for archaeological studies in Italy, which now progressed rapidly. Eduard Gerhard (1795–1867) founded the study of Greek vase painting as a scientific discipline; his report on the numerous Greek vases excavated from the Etruscan necropolis of Vulci (1831) was epoch-making. In Bonn, Welcker built up the first large collection of plaster casts of Greek sculpture. Another pioneer of the study of Greek art was his colleague Otto Jahn (1813–69), also an excellent Latinist. After the establishment of the Greek kingdom in 1830 the various European nations set up schools in Athens as they had done in Rome, and excavations on a large scale took place not only in Greece but all over the eastern Mediterranean world.\n\nIn archaeology the great impetus came from an amateur, Heinrich Schliemann (1822–90), whom no one can deprive of the credit for having guessed that remarkable finds might be made at Troy, Mycenae, and Tiryns, for having deliberately made a fortune so that he might do so, and for having discovered and promoted the great archaeologist Wilhelm Dörpfeld (1853–1940). In 1900 the ancient city of Knossos on Crete was excavated by the English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851–1941), which enabled the study of Mycenaean civilization to be supplemented by that of Minoan. The French excavated the two great Apollonian shrines at Delos and Delphi.\n\nPapyri had been found in large numbers in the Epicurean library at Herculaneum discovered during the 18th century, and from 1878, when a roll turned up in Egypt, sporadic finds were made. From about the 1870s systematic excavation led to a steady stream of discoveries, mostly from al-Fayyūm, where the sunshine acts upon the soil in such a way as to preserve papyrus. The Italian Amedeo Peyron (1785–1870) was a pioneer in the new discipline of papyrology, as was Domenico Comparetti (1835–1927), the author of a famous book about the fortune of Virgil’s works during the Middle Ages. The eminent Italian legal scholar and paleographer Girolamo Vitelli (1849–1935) became an expert papyrologist and had great personal influence. In Germany important papyri were published under the supervision of Wilhelm Schubart with the help of Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In 1891 the Constitution of Athens by Aristotle and the poems of Herodas were published from a papyrus in the British Museum, and in 1897 they were followed by the poems of Bacchylides from the 5th century bc. In 1898 the Oxford scholars B.P. Grenfell and A.S. Hunt brought out the first volume of the series, still not concluded, that contains the texts of the papyri found by them at Oxyrhynchus. Documentary papyri supply useful evidence for law and government in Roman Egypt, and literary papyri supply a priceless supplement to the knowledge of Greek (and occasionally Latin) literature.\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of many great enterprises, both individual and collective, that have equipped scholars with invaluable tools: collections of fragments, inscriptions, and works of art; and improved dictionaries, special lexica, handbooks, encyclopaedias, and catalogs of manuscripts. The invention of photography made it possible to produce facsimiles of manuscripts and documents and to distribute better likenesses of monuments and works of art. Many of these projects were sponsored by the various national academies, which were now linked by the Association des Académies, the driving force of which was Mommsen.\n\nThe rise of professionalism\n\nAssociated with Germany was the movement toward what may be called professionalism during the second half of the 19th century. Though Wolf’s example in founding a classical periodical in the vernacular had been followed elsewhere (e.g., the English Classical Journal, 1810–29), journals written primarily by professional scholars for professional scholars only began to proliferate after about 1850. Coupled with this proliferation were the increased importance of universities, seminars, and academies (with their published proceedings) and the growing habit of early publication of, for instance, the Ph.D. dissertation, the academic “program,” and the technical monograph.\n\nSpecialization was accompanied by a rise in technical standards of argument and presentation and a tendency toward the use of learned jargon—a phenomenon particularly noticeable in classical studies because of the contrast with earlier scholarly literature. An allied change was the replacement of Latin by the vernacular as a medium of scholarly intercourse and publication (with traditional exceptions, such as the preface and apparatus of a critical text). Thus, since about 1850 a classical scholar who wished to keep abreast of developments in the subject has had to be able to read at the least English, French, German, Italian, and, in some cases, Russian. These changes had more immediate results in continental Europe and the United States; in England their effects were delayed in part by the insularity that characterized English scholarship after Bentley, in part by the concentration of the older universities on teaching, and a consequent distrust by tutors of a strong professoriate and of “pure research.”\n\nLate 19th-century developments in German scholarship\n\nGermany made so vast a contribution to 19th-century classical scholarship that it would be impossible to name all of the eminent scholars of the period. But from a time rather earlier than the establishment of the German Empire (1871), signs of decline might be observed; the new methods had begun to harden into orthodoxy, mechanically applied by a mass of inferior practitioners. There was a strong tendency toward excessive emendation and deletion, and the overconscientious accumulation of details led to much dullness. From this situation German scholarship was to make a remarkable, though not complete, recovery, thanks to the generation of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (1848–1931), who broke down the barriers that had grown up between the divisions of his subject, making important contributions to them all. He was the author of the first commentary on a Greek poem in which the entire apparatus of modern scholarship, encompassing not only literary knowledge but also that of history, art, archaeology, linguistics, and religion, was brought to bear on the elucidation of the work in question; this was his commentary on the Herakles of Euripides (1st edition, with a remarkable introduction to Attic tragedy, 1889; 2nd edition, 1895). Wilamowitz-Moellendorff produced many more texts and commentaries, besides important work on Greek history, religion, metre, and the history of scholarship. As a professor in Greifswald, Göttingen, and finally Berlin, he exercised a powerful influence.\n\nAt the same time Eduard Schwartz (1851–1940) did much not only for the study of Greek history and literature but also for the history of the Christian Church; Georg Kaibel (1850–1901) advanced the study of Greek drama and of verse inscriptions; and Carl Robert (1850–1922) combined archaeological with literary expertise in remarkable fashion. Friedrich Leo (1851–1914) contributed significantly to Plautine studies and began a history of Latin literature of high quality. Jacob Wackernagel (1853–1938) of Basel and Wilhelm Schulze (1863–1935) used their mastery of comparative linguistics to throw light on Greek and Latin texts. Richard Reitzenstein (1861–1931) was eminent not only in the field of Greek literature and lexicography but also in that of ancient religion. Ludwig Traube (1861–1907) did important work in Latin paleography."
