        "text": "What was the perception of Greece in Europe during the later nineteenth century, when the attraction of romantic philhellenism had waned? This volume focuses on the reception of medieval and modern Greece in the European press, rigorously analysing journals and newspapers published in England, France, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands. The essays here suggest that reactions to the Greek state’s progress and irredentist desires were followed among the European intelligentsia. Concurrently, new scholarship on the historical development of the Greek language and vernacular literature enhanced the image of medieval and modern Greece. This volume’s contributors consider the press’s role in this Europewide exchange of ideas, explore the links between romantic and late philhellenism and underscore the scholarly nature of the latter. Moreover, they highlight the human aspects of cultural transfers by focusing on networks of mediators, publishers and scholarly collaborators. This context enhances our understanding of both the creation of Hellenic studies and the complex formation of the modern Greek identity.\n\nHelen Fessas-Emmanouil Cultural interaction, modernity and identity. Τhe friendship and cooperation between a German and a Greek architect (1899-1914) This presentation is based on my book* about the architectural friendship and collaboration between a German and a Greek architect2 which was the product of lengthy research. It approaches the architecture of the late 1890s and the fourteen turbulent years preceding World War I, a highly significant, but inadequately studied period of European architecture, which coincides with the decline of historicism and eclecticism and the dawn of anti-academic modernism. The period is approached through the relationship and correspondence between pioneer architect Aristotelis Zachos (Kastoria 1871 - Athens 1939) and his philhellene professor and first employer Josef Durm (Karlsruhe 1837-1919). The content of the two men’s letters and documentary material refers to major architectural, town planning, cultural and political developments in this period. In addition, the work of these two architects and the dialogue between them provides insight into recurring issues, such as cultural interaction, identity, the spirit of place (genius loci), the relations between modernity and tradition, the protection of historical monuments, architectural evaluation and architectural competitions. The presentation is thus structured into three parts. The first part provides the information required for today’s readers to understand the friendship between the two architects. It begins with general information about the era in which they collaborated and corresponded. Then it sketches the historical context in Germany and Greece at that time, emphasizing the intellectual climate in each, the particularities of Karlsruhe and the duchy of Baden, architectural trends, the protection of historical monuments, archaeology and urban development. An attempt is likewise made to approach the architects’ personalities, careers and the relationship between them, so as to associate their course with major historical events. The second part of the presentation includes evidence of Zachos’ architectural collaboration with Durm in Karlsruhe between 1901 and 1905. The correpondence between the two architects and their activities from 1905 to 1914, is the topic of the third part. ________________________________________ *Helen Fessas-Emmanouil, Αριστοτέλης Ζάχος & Josef Durm, Η αλληλογραφία ενός πρωτοπόρου αρχιτέκτονα με τον μέντορά του (Aristotelis Zachos & Josef Durm.
