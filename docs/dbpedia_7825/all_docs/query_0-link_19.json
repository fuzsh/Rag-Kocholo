        "text": "Focusing upon a specific corpus of articles published in Die Alten Sprachen, the Classics teachers’ periodical produced by the National Socialist Teachers’ League (the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund or NSLB), this chapter examines some of the ways in which the Classics became politicized for propagandistic purposes under the Nazi regime. Whether seeking to portray ancient Sparta as a prototype of the Nazi “racial state”, identifying Socrates as an ancient representative of the Jewish intelligentsia, or treating the Roman Empire as a model for Hitler’s own imperial project, Classics teachers in the Third Reich sought to present the ancient past as an explicit “paradigm and warning” for the National Socialist present. In addition to providing a general overview of the permeation of secondary-school Classics-teaching with National Socialist ideology, the chapter explores one specific case study in greater detail, an essay by Kurt Schmidt entitled ‘The Teaching of Xenophon’s Anabasis in National-Socialist Schools’ (1937). Schmidt describes in detail how Xenophon’s work should be interpreted in order to instil pupils with the correct political Weltanschauung; prevailing presentism relentlessly demanded that passages in the Anabasis should constantly be connected to events in modern German history, and that Xenophon himself be portrayed as a Führer-personality, a great dictator avant la lettre. However, the chapter as a whole also aims to demonstrate the surprising variety of the contributions which Die Alten Sprachen accepted, reflecting both the diverse status of those involved – from university professors to trainee teachers – and the extent of their assimilation of National Socialist politics (some articles meet recognized scholarly standards, whilst others are unashamedly demagogic, laced through with racial buzzwords and multiple exclamation marks). Through a fuller appreciation of the compromises and shades of grey which coloured the journal’s material, we not only avoid being taken in by the post-war canard that Classicists were never true collaborators, but also by the correspondingly one-sided view that Classics-teaching during the Third Reich was always irredeemably ideological.\n\nThe past ten years have witnessed a surge in literature about the German intellectual world during and after the Thirty Years War. Earlier work on German universities by Notker Hammerstein, a stream of publications on historia literaria and polymathy, the articles flowing from the pen of Martin Mulsow, and the attention for disputations in the work of scholars such as Hanspeter Marti and Sari Kivistö have all shown that the institutions and networks of learning suffered less from the Thirty Years War than its gruel destruction would lead us to assume. Scholars, teachers, and the learned book trade proved remarkably resilient. Individual German states might have attempted to exert rigid control over their educational system, but from a bird's-eye view, the patchy territories of Germany show not only a large number of schools and universities but also a highly diverse and incredibly competitive market. Political fragmentation did not cripple the educational system, but actually enriched it. The recent historiography has also shown how much the German Republic of Letters (the Gelehrtenrepublik) was institutionalized in these schools and universities. A scholar in Germany did not have to feel isolated in the countryside: if there was no university close by, there was at least a Latin School or Territorial School. All the more surprising, therefore, is the dearth of attention for the secondary system of education. This neglect is largely due to a lack of sources. Whereas research into universities and their students is facilitated by relatively well-kept archives of curators and professorial senates, by serial sources such as registers of enrollments and of doctoral dissertations, there is very little material available on the life of Latin Schools. Historians have a myopic view of them for their reliance on state archives and law-givers; their many stipulations, as Alan Ross repeatedly argues, disclose little about their enforcement. It appears that Latin Schools were, in fact, tremendously flexible and independent in attending to local needs and regional competition. Perhaps the lack of historians' interests in Latin Schools can also be explained because of the lack of intellectual excitement the daily routine of a Latin School raises: despite the constant adaptations in pedagogical method, little was taught or discovered that was truly innovative. And yet Latin Schools were often centers of learning outside courts and academia, and not the receptacle for would-be Republicans of Letters with stalled careers. A strong point of the book under review is its stress that German Latin schools played a crucial double role in education: their lowest forms tailored to a German-speaking market of artisan families, and the higher forms targeted aspiring students."
