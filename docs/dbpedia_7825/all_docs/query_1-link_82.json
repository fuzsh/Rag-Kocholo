        "text": "Reprint, stapled. Condition: Gut. pp.1-9. From the library of Prof. Wolfgang Haase, long-time editor of the ANRW and the International Journal of the Classical Tradition (IJCT). - With dedication of the author to W. Haase. - Author's name handwritten on cover, otherwise good and clean. - From the text: I was programmed to like Germans. My maternal grandfather was a German. His name was Friedrich Georg Fischer. His parents had emigrated from Hamburg to New York. He became president of the New York branch of Norddeutsche Lloyd. Later he became executive vice-president of W. R. Grace. Because his name was not Grace he could not become president. [.] Wolfgang Schindler introduced me to Werner Krenkel, who wasted no time. I was soon invited to lecture at Rostock and nearby Greifswald. My lecture was purest Anglo-Saxon positivism without a hint of politics. It was concerned with the composition of Seneca, Troades,1 and promptly published by Werner Krenkel. In spring semester 1968 the miracle occurred. Due to the tact and diplomacy of Werner Krenkel, himself not a Genosse, an American, a Spätkapitalist kurz vor dem Zusammenbruch\", became guest professor for classics and American studies at Rostock, the first American guest-professor in the DDR. [.] My whole Senecabild I owe the DDR. Life under Stalinism provided the best parallel possible to life under Nero. Seneca's goal was to survive in an impossible situation. A Stoic must find out by what rules the kosmos was run and abide by them. That is: informed resignation. The alternative was selfdestruction. Without the DDR my work on Seneca would have remained sterile positivism and Wortphilologie or the petulant Puritanism that characterizes his Western liberal often female critics, that is persons with no experience whatever in the brutality of amoral totalitarianism. Sprache: Englisch Gewicht in Gramm: 550.\n\nOriginal cloth. Condition: Sehr gut. 202 p. From the library of Prof. Wolfgang Haase, long-time editor of ANRW and the International Journal of the Classical Tradition (IJCT). - Zustand: Im einwandfreien Zustand. / Condition: In perfect condition. - Content: Mr P. G. Naiditch (Special Collections, University of California at Los Angeles) first alerted Calder in 1989 to the existence at Claremont of the 124 letters and postcards of Hermann Diels to Theodor Gomperz and his one letter to Elise Gomperz. In a letter of 9 September 1993 to Calder Ms Jean Beckner, Special Collections Librarian, kindly conveyed owners' permission from Mrs. Judy Harvey Sahak, Head of Special Collections, to publish the first 125 letters in this volume. The letters are in The Gomperz Collection, Special Collections Department, Honnold/Mudd Library, The Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California. The letters were given by Heinrich Gomperz to his friend and fellow refugee, the philosopher, Philip Merlan (20 December 1897 - 23 December 1968). Professor Merlan, long on the faculty of Scripps College, and his wife, presented them to the Honnold Library in 1959. Professor Thomas R. Martin, earlier of Claremont College, helpfully assisted Calder in tracking down the documents. The twenty-one letters and postcards of Diels to Heinrich Gomperz, edited within as numbers 126-146, are in Special Collections, The University Library, The University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. Mr John Ahouse of Special Collections in his letter of 21 July 1994 to Calder has kindly granted owners' permission to publish. The editors are grateful for help to a number of scholars. Four scholars deserve special thanks. Prof. Dr. Jaap Mansfeld (Utrecht) read with great care an early version of the letters to Theodor Gomperz. In a nine page letter to Calder of 22 June 1994 he made considerable improvements on the text and provided invaluable exegetical material. The citations that bear his name reveal only a bit of what we owe him. Probably the most abstruse matter in the texts that follow are Diels' philological observations on the newly edited papyrological texts of Philodemos. The editors were incompetent to control them. With extraordinary generosity and at a busy time, Professor Dirk Obbink (Barnard College, New York), an international authority on this author, promptly provided expert annotation for the letters concerned with Philodemus. Apart from the many notes initialed D.O., all notes containing precise attributions of passages in Philodemos are owed him. The editors wish to make clear that their edition could never have been completed without his aid. For expert help on letter No. 71, concerned with Callimachus, Hekale we are grateful to Dr A. J. Hollis (Keble College, Oxford), the leading living authority on that poem. He has allowed us to cite his views in n. 480 infra. For elusive exegetical material cited within, the editors are indebted to Prof. Dr. Wilt Aden Schröder (Hamburg). We are grateful also for prompt replies to specific queries to Anton Bieri (Harvard/Leipzig), M. S. Armstrong (Hobart), M. H. Chambers (UCLA), R. L. Fowler (Waterloo/All Souls), Albert Henrichs (Harvard), Christhard Hoffmann (Berlin/Berkeley), Martin Hose (Greifswald), George Huxley (Dublin/Oxford), Luigi Lehnus (Milan), Jörgen Mejer (Copenhagen), P. G. Naiditch (UCLA), Edgar Pack (Erfurt/Köln), and R. Stroud (Berkeley). Calder thanks the Fondation Hardt (Vandoeuvres) for an invitation in summer 1994 that allowed the leisure and books for concentrated work on the edition. The volume is a Kollektivarbeit in the sense that all three editors read three drafts of the manuscript through carefully and together improved the whole considerably. More particularly the division of labor was the following: Dr Dietrich Ehlers (Berlin), the greatest living authority on the handwriting of Hermann Diels, made the first transcription of the documents. The demands of this difficult task can not be overestimated. The value of an edition depends first on the accuracy of its texts. Maximilian Braun (Munich/Urbana) worked closely with Calder on the exegetical commentary which also incorporates contributions by Dr. Ehlers. The two indices are owed M. Braun. The introduction and preface are by Calder. Stephen Trzaskoma M.A. (Berlin/Urbana) with his accustomed skill arranged the layout and provided expert camera-ready-copy. And he proofread the whole. The participation of these three scholars was made possible by grants from the Annual Research Fund of the William Abbott Oldfather Professorship of the Classics at the University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign. In our edition we have censored nothing. All 146 preserved letters and postcards known to us by Diels to Theodor, Elise and Heinrich Gomperz have been published in full within. The one letter of Theodor Gomperz to Diels, known because published in part by Diels, is referred to within but not republished. ISBN 9783615001723 Sprache: Englisch Gewicht in Gramm: 782."
