This document summarizes Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff's 1908 visit to Oxford to give two lectures. It reviews the context of the visit, as Wilamowitz was a renowned German scholar of Classics at the time. The document analyzes the lectures in light of Wilamowitz's body of work and scholarly approach, which integrated history, philology, archaeology and more for a holistic understanding of antiquity. It explores why Wilamowitz still provokes strong reactions and considers his significant impact on establishing modern approaches to Classics.",
