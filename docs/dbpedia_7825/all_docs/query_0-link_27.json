This document discusses the reading methods of the 19th century German classical scholar Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. It describes how he was educated at a prestigious humanistic gymnasium where he rivaled Nietzsche. As a student, he was most influenced by Gottlieb Welcker and learned to read texts closely and immerse himself in the context of the ancient world. Wilamowitz believed true understanding required pouring one's blood into the ghosts of the past to bring them to life. He advocated analyzing the precise language and thought processes found in fragments and all references to reconstruct an author's original meaning and intentions.",
