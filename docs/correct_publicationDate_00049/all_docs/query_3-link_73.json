        "text": "D-Series ACE Doubles\n\nD-13 THEODORE S. DRACHMAN Cry Plague (cover by Lou Marchetti; 1953; listed as \"ACE Original\") and D-13b LESLIE EDGLEY The Judas Goat (1953; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\")\n\nThe Drachman story is often listed as the first of the SF stories in an ACE double format (even though it is backed with the Edgley mystery). However, most compilers list D-31 as the first (true) SF ACE Double.\n\nThe listing \"complete and unabridged\" is a result of action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the post-WWII publishing industry. To counter the wide-spread belief by the book-buying public that paperback books were always shortened version of the original hardcover texts, publishers were required by the FTC to prominently indicate on the front cover if there was an original title (often shown in parentheses) and to state that the book was either an \"abridgement\" or identical to the original text (listed as \"complete and unabridged\"). Source: Thomas L. Bonn Undercover: The Illustrated History of the American Mass Market Paperback (1982; Penguin Books; pp. 56-57).\n\nD-31 A. E. VAN VOGT The World of Null-A (cover by Stanley Meltzoff; c.1948; 1953; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and D-31b A. E. VAN VOGT Universe Maker (1953; listed as \"ACE Original\")\n\nA.E. van VOGT (1912 - 2000) was born in Canada and moved to the U.S. in 1944, by which time he was well-established as one of John W. Campbell's stable of 'Golden Age' writers for Astounding Science-Fiction. The World of Null-A (1948) developed complicated themes of non-Aristotlian logic.\n\nSTANLEY MELTZOFF (1917-2006) started his career as art editor for \"Stars and Stripes\" during WWII. He taught at CCNY and Pratt Institute, and influenced a number of young artists such as Paul Lehr and John Schoenherr. Although he only produced a small number of science fiction covers, he is considered important for how he influenced the genre.\n\nD-36 ROBERT E. HOWARD Conan the Conqueror (cover by Norman Saunders; 1953; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and D-036b LEIGH BRACKETT The Sword of Rhiannon (cover by Robert E. Schultz; 1953; listed as \"ACE Original\")\n\nLEIGH DOUGLAS BRACKETT (1915-1978) was one of the earliest of the women science fiction (and fantasy) writers. Her first published science fiction story, Martian Quest, appeared in Astounding in 1940. She was a prolific writer in the genres of science fiction (her most recognized story is probably The Long Tomorrow, c. 1955), mystery, and western as well as television and movie scripts (\"The Big Sleep\" in 1946 and \"Rio Bravo\" in 1958).\n\nROBERT EMIL SCHULZ (1928-1978) was an illustrator (with a degree in architecture from Princeton University) who produced cover art for Pocket, Signet, Dell, and Bantam as well as illustrations for \"men's\" magazines such as Adventure and Men's Digest. In addition to his well received cover art for I, Robot, he also did many western covers that included a series of reissues of Zane Grey stories by Pocket Books.\n\nI believe that The Sword of Rhiannon may be the first Robert Schultz cover for ACE Books.\n\nD-44 ERIC FRANK RUSSELL Sentinels of Space (cover by Robert E. Schultz; 1954) and D-44b DONALD A. WOLLHEIM (ed.) The Ultimate Invaders and Other Science-Fiction (cover by Stanley Meltzoff; 1954)\n\nD-53 MURRAY LEINSTER (aka WILL F.

VAN VOGT The Weapon Shops of Isher (1954; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\")\n\nOriginal cover art by Harry Barton for Gateway to Elsewhere\n\nD-61 L. SPRAGUE de CAMP Cosmic Manhunt (1954; listed as \"ACE Original\") and D-61b CLIFFORD D. SIMAK Ring Around the Sun (1954; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\")\n\nD-69 ANDRE NORTON Daybreak -2250 A.D. (original title: Star Man's Son; 1954; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and D-69b LEWIS PADGETT (aka HENRY KUTTNER) and C. L. MOORE Beyond Earth's Gates (1954)\n\nBorn February 17, 1912 in Cleveland, Ohio, ALICE MARY NORTON started writing in her teens. First contacts with the publishing world led her, as many other contemporary female writers targeting a male-dominated market, to choose a literary pseudonym (aka ANDREW NORTH and ANDRE NORTON). In 1934 she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton.\n\nD-73 DONALD A. WOLLHEIM (ed.) Adventures in the Far Future (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1954) and D-73b DONALD A. WOLLHEIM (ed.) Tales of Outer Space (cover by Mort Lawrence; 1954)\n\nAdventures in the Far Future is the first ACE Double cover by Ed Valigursky.\n\nStories from Adventures in the Far Future include: The Wind Between The Worlds by Lester del Rey; Stardust by Chad Oliver; Overdrive by Murray Leinster; The Millionth Year by Martin Pearson; and The Chapter Ends by Poul Anderson).\n\nStories from Tales of Outer Space include: Doorway In the Sky by Ralph Williams; Here We Lie by Fox B. Holden; Operation Mercury by Clifford D. Simak; Lord Of A Thousand Suns by Poul Anderson; and Behind The Black Nebula by L. Ron Hubbard).\n\nEDWARD L. VALIGURSKY (b. 1926) graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburg after a stint in the U.S. Navy in WWII. An illustrator for Amazing, Fantastic Adventures, and Worlds of IF (later IF) magazines, he also illustrated for numerous paperback publishers (ACE, Pyramid, Lancer, etc.) as well as popular mainstream and men's magazine including Saga, Argosy, Collier's, and Popular Mechanics. In addition, he also produced advertisement illustration as well as in the aviation field. His work is rarely signed and he used a pseudonym (William Rembach) on a few illustration.\n\nD-79 FRANCIS RUFUS BELLAMY Atta: A Novel of a Most Extraordinary Adventure (1954; listed as \"A Complete Science Fiction Novel\") and D-79b MURRAY LEINSTER (aka WILL F.

NOURSE A Man Obsessed (cover by Peyton;1955; listed as \"Complete Novel\")\n\nALAN EDWARD NOURSE (b. 1928) is one of science fiction's early medical practioners. Trained at Pennylvania Medical School, his expertise was incorporated into A Man Obsessed which addresses brain surgery and psychology while The Mercy Men (1968) investigates medical testing and the use of experimental human subjects for pay. He wrote non-fiction (The Nine Planets - astronomy) as well as a number of tales in juvenile (now called young adult) literature.\n\nOn a personal note, The Bladerunner, Scavengers In Space, and The Universe Between were three influential books that I read as a child that helped focus my interest in science.\n\nD-99 ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS Conquest of the Space Sea (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and D-99b LEIGH BRACKETT The Galactic Breed (original title: The Starmen; c.1952; 1955; listed as \"Revised Edition\")\n\nThe Galactic Breed is an abridged (ACE Books used \"revised edition\") version of The Starmen, published in hardcover by Gnome Press in 1952. The Starmen was an expanded version of the 1951 Startling Stories serial titled The Starmen of Llyrdis.\n\nD-103 PHILIP K. DICK Solar Lottery (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"Complete Novel\") and LEIGH BRACKETT The Big Jump (cover by Robert Schultz; 1955; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\")\n\nD-110 POUL ANDERSON No World of Their Own (1955; listed as \"Complete Novel\") and ISAAC ASIMOV 1,000 Year Plan (original title: Foundation; cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"Abridged\")\n\nPOUL ANDERSON (1926-2001), a former President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association, earned three Nebula and seven Hugo awards. He published over 100 novels and short story collections. He is remembered as one of the most imaginative and hugely prolific authors of science fiction's Golden Age. His works include Satan's World, Tau Zero, Midsummer Tempest, The Boat of a Million Years, Three Hearts and Three Lions, The Enemy Stars, and Brain Wave. In 1997, he received SFWA's Grandmaster Award and in 2000 he was inducted to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.\n\nD-113 DWIGHT V. SWAIN The Transposed Man (1955; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and D-113b J. T. McINTOSH (aka JAMES MURDOCH MacGREGOR) One in 300 (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\")\n\nThe Transposed Man is Dwight V. Swain's only science fiction novel.\n\nJAMES MURDOUCH MacGREGOR (b. 1925) graduated from the University of Aberdeen and was a prolific author during the late 1950's to early 1970's.\n\nD-118 CHARLES L. HARNESS The Paradox Men (original title: Flight Into Yesterday; cover by Richard Powers; 1955; listed as \"Complete and Unabridged\") and JACK WILLIAMSON Dome Around America (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"Complete Novel\")\n\nRICHARD M. POWERS (1921-1996) employed a range of illustration styles that influenced generations of artists. His covers are distinctive and invoke connections with surrealism, symbolism, and the abstract. He signed his works in many ways, ranging from Gorman (or Gorman Powers) to Powers LAZ/Org. An amazingly prolific artist, the best source for additional information is Jane Frank's The Art of Richard Powers (Paper Tiger, 2001).\n\nI believe (still checking) that The Paradox Men is the first ACE Books cover art by Richard Powers.\n\nD-121 SAM MERWIN, JR. 3 Faces of Time (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1955; listed as \"complete and unabridged\") and D-121b ANDRE NORTON The Stars Are Ours! (cover by Ed Valigursky; c. 1954; 1955; listed as \"complete and unabridged\")\n\n3 Faces of Time is the sequel to alternate worlds story of The House of Many Worlds (1951).\n\nSAM MERWIN JR. combined both writing and magazine editing. He was the editor of Thrilling Wonder and Startling Stories from 1945 to 1951. From 1951 he edited Fantastic Story Magazine and Wonder Story Magazine, early issues of Fantastic Universe, and was Assistant Editor of Galaxy and Beyond.\n\nD-119 [NOTE: Although Corrick has D-119 listed as the Merwin and Norton stories, my copy is marked D-121] There is no notation for a D-119 in the Graham Holyrod checklist (2003). I have been contacted by several AIL users and these titles should be properly listed as D-121.\n\n.D-139 NICK BODDIE WILLIAMS The Atom Curtain (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1956) and GORDON R.

KELLEAM Overlords From Space (1956; listed as \"Complete Novel\")\n\nRAYMOND KING CUMMINGS (1887-1957) was an adventurer (gold prospecting, oil field, and orange plantations) and later an editor for Thomas Alva Edison. His writing career spanned thirty years and he is most remembered for one of his earliest stories, \"The Girl in the Golden Atom\" (c. 1919), as well as being one of the authors used by Gernsback in the early Amazing pulp magazine.\n\nD-176 MARGARET ST. CLAIR The Green Queen (cover by Malcolm Smith; 1956; listed as \"Complete Novel\") and D-176b THOMAS CALVERT McCLARY 3 Thousand Years (cover by Ed Valigursky; 1956; listed as \"Complete & Unabridged\")\n\nMALCOLM H.

After a period of time as an independent artist and art director for several magazines (Fate and Other Worlds), he worked for NASA as an artist at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama until his death. His works are in their permanent collection.\n\nThis may represent the first ACE Books cover by Malcolm Smith.\n\nD-193 PHILIP K.

WOLLHEIM (ed.) The Earth in Peril (cover by Emsh; 1957) and LAN WRIGHT (aka LIONEL PERCY WRIGHT) Who Speaks of Conquest?

His interior illustrations have brought to life many a story in Astounding Science Fiction (and later Analog) and influenced many other artists.
