Clarke, an English author born on December 1917 in Minehead, England and who has produced works such as Childnhood’s End’ and the highly popular 2001: A Space Odyssey’ which Stanley Kubrik adapted into a movie.\n\nWith over one hundred books to his name, many of Arthur C. Clarke’s ideas have had a profound impact upon technological advancements and science fiction as a whole. The writer died in 2008.\n\n+Biography\n\nArthur Charles Clarke was the son of a farmer. He finished his studies at King’s College in London. Before trying his hand at writing fiction, Arthur dabbled in scientific research; it was during his work as a radar instructor in WWII that he posited the idea of satellite communications. This was in a scientific article he wrote in 1945 some decades before the idea ever manifested practically.\n\nAlong with predictions of uniquely powerful inventions such as advanced computers, super fast communications and space shuttles, Arthur C. Clarke’s impressive collection of written works was always exploratory, attempting to define the role mankind would play not only in the future but the universe.\n\nWith popular books such as The Fountain of paradise’ and 2001: A Space Odyssey’ to his name, Arthur’s works have enjoyed as much popularity in their adapted film formats as they did when first published as written content.\n\n-Personal Life\n\nArthur C. Clarke was married in 1953 and divorced nine years later; the marriage never produced any children. The author was granted knighthood by Queen Elizabeth in 2000; however his ill health inhibited his ability to receive the honor personally.\n\nWhile born in England, Arthur found a permanent home in Sri Lanka in 1956; he was particularly attracted by the prospect of Marine Diving that the nation provided.\n\n-Death\n\nArthur C. Clarke died in March 2008; along with post polio syndrome (which had plagued him for many a year and stranded his body in a wheelchair), the author had been suffering with breathing problems. He passed away in Sri Lanka at the age of 90 years. He was honored by Mahinda Rajapakse, the Sri Lankan President, who called him a great visionary.\n\n-Themes\n\nArthur C. Clarke’s works have always presented a very optimistic view of the role of mankind in the universe, specifically regarding their portended ability to explore the galaxy and the empowering effect science could have on their growth.\n\nArthur’s vision of the future often took the shape of utopian cultures home to highly advanced technologies and societies. He showed a keen interest in extrapolating scientific breakthroughs and unique technologies into the decadent facets of today’s society.\n\nOften present in Clarke’s stories was the eventual destiny of sentient species, whose continued evolution would result in beings akin to gods; the author was said to speak rather highly of Olaf Stapledon and his book Last and First Men’, whose impact on his life was nothing short of profound (Olaf’s works regularly tackled the issue of transcendence through evolution).\n\n+Against the Fall of Night\n\nAt the age of ten billion years, Diaspar is the last of humanity’s habitats. Among the immortals, a man, the only man to be born for ten million years, seeks to explore what lies beyond the boundaries of the city. In undertaking his journey, this man will discover the destiny of his people and the galaxy as a whole.\n\nThe story of Against the fall of Night’ takes place against the backdrop of a tragedy; several million years ago, earth was assaulted by beings only known as the invaders; the result was a battle that laid to waste civilized society as it was known, with the remnants of man finding refuge behind the walls of Diaspar, the last of the human cities.\n\nWithin Diaspar, they pass their immortal lives in peace, their every need and pleasure met by the greatest machines ever invented; yet they also live in fear, plagued by notions of the unknown, the future and the wastelands beyond.\n\nHowever when Alvin of Lorenei (the last child born in Diaspar) comes into being, his curiosity and courage threatens to change things as they have been known for millions of years.\n\nThis story from Arthur C. Clarke is surprisingly exciting, bringing to life the tale of Alvin in his attempts to circumvent the obstacles of his own people as he seeks to explore the wider world. With the future of humankind ultimately coming to rest upon his shoulders, Arthur C. Clarke fuses elements of true science with fictional elements to create a perfect amalgam that will entice and entertain even hardcore science fiction fans.\n\n+The Sands of Mars\n\nMartin Gibson, celebrated science fiction writer, is availed the opportunity to journey to space; and upon embarking on his first trip to Mars, Martin causes one unexpected problem after another. And, it is as he stumbled across the red planet that he begins to unmask Mar’s most carefully kept secret.\n\nReading Arthur C. Clarke’s earlier works is an experience like few others, allowing one to compare how drastically the science fiction genre has changed. Indeed the presence of fax machines on a spaceship capable of interstellar travel is bound to attract a few chuckles.\n\nThe world building is rather impressive, with even those brief descriptions of Mars proving picturesque in presenting a truly breathtaking vision. Younger readers are bound to appreciate the novel for its simplistic approach to storytelling. Indeed The Sands of Mars’ is quite the easy read. And even with the predictable ending, there are quite a number of surprises along the way, many of them character driven.\n\nAdmittedly, for a novel written in the 1950s, some readers might fail to integrate into Arthur C. Clarke’s mindset. For an even smaller minority, Arthur C. Clarke’s tales, books like ‘The sands of Mars’ can only boast of pioneering unique ideas but ultimately fail to master these elements in delivering a truly noteworthy novel capable of transcending time. However, most readers tend to appreciate the tone of relatively ancient science fiction tales such as this.\n\nUltimately, even with recent advancements in the science fiction arena, even with all those giants of the genre, attracting global fame and essentially setting the literary world of fire, few authors could ever truly hope to contend with the name Arthur C. Clarke."
