Nourse’s 1958 novel of fortunes made and lost, murder, and betrayal among the asteroid miners. Originally published in the September, 1958 issue of AMAZING SCIENCE FICTION STORIES magazine.\n\nStar Surgeon\n\nAlan E. Nourse was both a science fiction writer and a physician, publishing many works of fiction and non-fiction in his lifetime. Star Surgeon is the story of Dal Timgar, a very tall, very thin, humanoid Garvian, his body covered with fine gray hair and his only companion a small lump of sentient pink fur named Fuzzy. ‘But as long as Dal could remember, he had wanted to be a doctor. From the first time he had seen a General Practice Patrol ship landing in his home city to fight the plague that was killing his people by the thousands, he had known that this was what he wanted more than anything else: to be a physician of Hospital Earth…\n\n‘\n\nThe Bladerunner\n\nIn 2014 seventeen year old Billy Gimp risks great danger as a procurer of illegal medical supplies for a skilled surgeon determined to provide health care for people considered unqualified for legal medical aid.\n\n12 Worlds of Alan E. Nourse\n\nThis volume assembles 12 classic tales by Alan E. Nourse: ‘Bear Trap’ originally appeared in Fantastic Universe, December 1957. ‘Circus,’ ‘The Dark Door,’ ‘Image of the Gods,’ ‘The Link,’ ‘Meeting of the Board,’ ‘My Friend Bobby,’ and ‘An Ounce of Cure’ originally appeared in The Counterfeit Man: More Science Fiction Stories by Alan E. Nourse, published in 1963. ‘The Coffin Cure’ originally appeared in Galaxy, April 1957. ‘Letter of the Law’ originally appeared in If Magazine, January 1954. ‘The Native Soil’ originally appeared in Fantastic Universe, July 1957. ‘PRoblem’ originally appeared in Galaxy, October 1956.\n\nScience Fiction Gems, Volume Two\n\nArmchair Fiction presents extra large paperback collections of the best in classic science fiction short stories. ‘Science Fiction Gems, Vol. Two’ features includes the incredible Hugo Awarding winning story, ‘Rat in the Skull’ by Rog Phillips. It also includes other fine works by James Blish, Robert Silverberg, Philip K. Dick, Manly Wade Wellman, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Alan E. Nourse, C. M. Kornbluth, Philip Jose Farmer, and others. This is another great collection of classic science fiction. It’s a guaranteed trip into the far off future and the deepest reaches of outer space.\n\nDerelict\n\nHe stared out at the great ship, feeling a chill of wonder and fear crawl up his spine. ‘So this is the mysterious puzzle of Saturn,’ he muttered. ‘This is what we’ve been waiting for.’ There was a curious eager light in Captain Loomis’ eyes as he looked up. ‘Oh, no. Not this.’ ‘What?’ ‘Not this. The ships we’ve seen before were tiny, flat.’ His little eyes turned toward the ship, and back to Sabo’s heavy face. ‘This is something else, something quite different.’ A smile curved his lips, and he rubbed his hands together. ‘We go out for trout and come back with a whale. This ship’s from space, deep space. Not from Saturn. This one’s from the stars.’ What was the mystery of this great ship from the dark, deep reaches of space? For within its death filled chambers was the avenue of life!\n\nRelated Authors\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky\n\nAlan Dean Foster\n\nAlistair MacLean\n\nAndre Norton\n\nChad Oliver\n\nCharlaine Harris\n\nChristopher G Nuttall\n\nDavid Weber"
