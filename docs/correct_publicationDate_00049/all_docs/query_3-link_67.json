        "text": "Short Stories by Science Fiction's Big Names\n\nAs was typical of '50s and '60s Science Fiction, many of these stories were much more about science than people and I found several of them quite dry. There are some great moments though, several stories with surprise endings I loved.\n\nAll in all, it's a good collection that reacquainted me with authors whose contribution to the genre is unquestioned and it's a perfect introduction for new SF fans looking to find explore the roots of the genre.\n\nAn enjoyable collection of stories well read by the editor.\n\nClever Classic Science Fiction\n\nI enjoyed these intriguing and clever tales of Science Fiction. These entertaining stories are mainly from the 1950s, but none are dated. I thought the narration my was excellent, but a few repetitions needed to be edited out.\n\nGood short stories\n\nI was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review.\n\nThis was a good collection of short stories from the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe narration was not terrible but it was not the best that I have ever heard.\n\nGreat assortment of Science Fiction Classics\n\nThose Oldies are Goodies and so is this Audio book.Go Download an assortment of mostly good stories with real characters crafted to perfection.\n\nThis Book was given to me for free at my request and I provided this voluntary review."
