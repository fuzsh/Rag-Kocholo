        "text": "Welcome to the Lost Sci-Fi Podcast, featuring sci-fi short stories from the 1940s, 50s and 60s with a few from the 1930s and one from 1899. In this episode we’ll tell you who we are, how we got started and why we’re doing the Lost Sci-Fi Podcast and it will be the only episode that does not include at least one lost sci-fi short story. Hi I’m Scott Miller audiobook narrator and your host for the Lost Sci-Fi Podcast. I’ve been narrating audiobooks for almost a decade and last year I discovered these amazing sci-fi short stories and wondered why the vast majority of them have never been available as audiobooks. The answer is probably that they haven’t been viewed as profitable since most of them are less than an hour long. To me this is a passion project, something I love to do and I want to share these stories with you at the lowest possible price. You can’t beat free so even though these audiobooks are available for sale, I decided to include at least one lost sci-fi short story in every episode of our podcast. I say at least one because some of the stories are less than 20 minutes long. When we have an episode with a story under 20 minutes we’ll include another short story. You can listen to any episode you want, in any order you want because you’ll hear the whole story or stories in every episode. So what kind of stories will you hear? Aliens, Asteroids, Space Ships, Space travelers, Time Travelers, Robots, Criminals, Scientists, Space Pirates, Space Colonies, Castaways and more. When you consider that these stories were written 60 to 100 years ago or more you’ll be amazed that these writers were, in some ways, actually predicting the future.Episode #1 features Philip K Dick and in later episodes you’ll hear from Ray Bradbury, Alan E. Nourse and hundreds of authors you’ve never even heard of. All with fascinating stories to tell, most of which have never been recorded before and most of them have never been available as audiobooks. We hope you enjoy the lost sci-fi podcast.Support the show Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nIf you’re old enough you may be surprised to discover that this short sci-fi story was written by a man whose work you have enjoyed on the big screen for 40 years! His 1968 novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” became the 1982 movie Blade Runner, Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos.Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/A 1966 short story he wrote showed up on the big screen as the 1990 smash hit Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone. Other box office blockbusters based on his works are Minority Report directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise, and 2011’s The Adjustment Bureau starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Amazon produced 4 seasons of “The Man In The High Castle”, based on his novel with the same name, set in a parallel universe where the Germans and Japanese win World War II and rule the world. Sadly he wasn’t alive to see these incredibly successful movies. Philip K Dick passed away in March 1982, 3 months before Blade Runner debuted. He was only 53.Philip Kindred Dick was a prolific American science fiction writer. He wrote 44 novels and somewhere around 120 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines like the one we’re going to share with you in today’s episode of the lost sci-fi podcast. His work, although cherished by many, received very little acclaim for about 10 years until he wrote the novel The Man In The High Castle.Todays lost sci-fi short story first appeared in December 1953 in “Science Fiction Adventures” Magazine which cost 35 cents. And now for your listening pleasure Philip K Dick’s, “The Hanging Stranger” Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nToday on the lost sci-fi podcast we’ll feature an author born in Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 20th, 1911. Our featured author is a pretty talented guy. He studied writing at the University of Colorado in Boulder and drawing, painting and lithography at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. His art was so good that some of his paintings of Indian ceremonial dances are part of the permanent collection at the Denver Art Museum. Keeping true to his Colorado roots he worked as an assistant curator of the Colorado State Historical Museum during the 1940s.Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareHe was also talented in the literary arts, having written over 200 stories and articles, poems, essays and one novel. In 1948 he published a chapbook, The Sphinx Child. What is a chapbook you ask? It’s a small collection of poems.From Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy in April 1955 enjoy this lost sci-fi short story written by Stanley Mullen.

See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nToday we’ve got two lost sci-fi short stories for you. On the surface they would appear to be dissimilar. But they do have a few things in common. Both stories were written by men, if you can believe the names used when the stories were published in 1954. The use of pseudonyms was very common in science fiction magazines during the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s. We know nothing about these two men and neither produced many stories that appear in the publications of the time, or since for that matter.Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareOur first story is one of my personal favorites for what you may consider an odd reason. When narrating an audiobook the writing style of some authors just, for lack of a better word, works. It flows off the tongue and it’s easy narrate. If I could find more stories by Richard Magruder I would narrate them. But this is the only one I could find. Our main character is an inventor, Nathanial Evergood was an eccentric old man with a photographic passion for pretty girls. So he invented a camera lens for special effects. From Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy in December 1954 And All The Girls Were Nude by Richard Magruder...I don’t know what it is about that story but I absolutely love it. One of the reasons I started narrating these lost sci-fi stories was that many of them had never been available as audiobooks. And All The Girls Were Nude was one of those. Is it just me or is that a great story? I’d love to hear your thoughts if you’d be kind enough to share them. Please feel free to send me an email at scott@lostscifi.com with any ideas, thoughts, comments or suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you.On to our second lost sci-fi short story. As mentioned previously I have been unable to discover anything about author Joseph Slotkin. This is the only short story I can find by Slotkin and like And All The Girls Were Nude it has never before been available as an audiobook. Helen LaTour had the best hip wriggle in galactic Burleyque. In fact, it was so good she hipped herself smack into another dimension!From Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy August 1954, The Queen of Space, by Joseph Slotkin... Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nLast week we heard from two authors who produced few works and we were unable to discover anything about them. However we know more about the author we’ll feature on the lost sci-fi podcast today. He was born in 1915 in Spooner, Wisconsin, just 6 years after the tiny town became a city. He wrote a story in 1940 and one in 1941 and then nothing for 12 years. In 1953 he produced 4 short stories, then 23 more in 1954 and 19 in 1955 when the story we’ll share with you was written. He was published throughout the 1950’s, then stopped once again for 8 years with one short story in 1967 and one in 1968. In my past I was a television news reporter and I would love to have interviewed this man, but he passed away in 1979.Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareToday’s episode of the lost sci-fi podcast features author Winston Marks. He was also known as Win Kinney, Winston March, Win Marks, Winston K. Marks and Ken Winney.It may seem strange but I was attracted to narrate this story by its rather unique title. An interstellar hunting trip with Major Daphne could teach a man a number of lessons. Like being kind to fellow human beings, or—Never Gut-shoot A Wampus.

Born on August 11th 1928 in Des Moines Iowa, after graduating high school he went to Rutgers University, two years in the Navy, then on to the University of Pennsylvania to become a Doctor. He helped pay for his medical degree by writing science fiction for magazines. In a 1952 issue of Other Worlds he said he started reading science fiction while at Rutgers and was reading sci-fi like a man possessed. Saying he ended up being the most incurable type of science fiction addict, the kind that has to write it as well as read it!Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareHe wrote more than 30 short stories and more than a dozen novels. If dating, getting married, college, medical school, the US Navy, writing for science fiction magazines and publishing his first novel weren’t enough in the first 5 years of the 1950’s, he also found the time to make 4 appearances on television as an actor, including one during the 8 year run of the The Philco Television Playhouse.And if that wasn’t enough, the Good Doctor had a column in Good Housekeeping Magazine. In 1965 he wrote a nonfiction book titled “Intern” under the pseudonym Doctor X.His legal name? Alan Edward Nourse. He’s perhaps better known as Alan E. Nourse. In the first episode of the Lost Sci-Fi podcast we mentioned that Philip K. Dicks Sci-Fi Novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” became the movie Blade Runner. But did you know that the movie got its name, not the content, the name and name only from the 1974 novel written by Alan E Nourse The Blade Runner? 3 minutes and 7 seconds after the credits for Blade Runner start you’ll see these words on the screen, With Thanks to Alan E Nourse for the use of the title Blade Runner. It really is 3 minutes and 7 seconds, yea, I’m weird like that.Matt had to destroy the rocket because it was a symbol of evil that had brought economic disaster. But must he also destroy—the future?

See acast.com/privacy for more information.\n\nWe have an amazing story for you today on the podcast, certainly one of the most fascinating stories we’ve ever heard. This author lived a pretty extraordinary life. He was hired by legendary Hollywood director Alfred Hitchcock to write a screenplay for what would become one of Hitchcock’s greatest movies. It was one of several screenplays written by our featured author. Actors who starred in projects he wrote and developed for the big screen and Television include Richard Chamberlain, F. Murray Abraham, Ben Johnson, Jerry Orbach, Robby Benson, Raquel Welch, Burt Reynolds, Yul Brynner, Tom Skerritt , Kirk Douglas, Kim Novak, Barbara Rush, Walter Matthau, Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy, and Suzanne Pleshette. Wow! If You’re a movie buff you may have already guessed that the Hitchcock classic he wrote the screenplay for was, The Birds.Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareBefore Hitchcock and Hollywood our author served on a destroyer in the Pacific in the Navy during World War II. We’re just getting started. He wrote more than 139 novels over 53 years! That’s an average of a little more than 2 and a half novels a year for more than half a century.He was born in East Harlem New York in 1926. Born Salvatore Albert Lombino, he legally changed his name to Evan Hunter in 1952, but before he did, he sold a short science fiction story to If, Worlds of Science Fiction Magazine. In the magazine, which had made its debut two months earlier in March 1952, he is credited with writing “Welcome, Martians!” As S.A. Lombino which as fas I can tell was one of only a handful of times he used his real name. So why the name change? Well, as the story goes an editor once told him his Italian heritage might stop him from achieving great success, so SA Lombino became Evan Hunter.Oh, and if you think you recognize the name Evan Hunter, you’re probably right. Lombino took a number of jobs in the early 1950’s to pay the bills while attempting to get his writing career off the ground. One of them led to a novel, which became a movie, starring Glenn Ford, Sidney Pointier, Vic Morrow and Anne Francis. He spent 17 days as a teacher at the Bronx Vocational High School in September 1950. That experience led to his 6th novel titled The Blackboard Jungle which became the movie of the same name starring the previously mentioned star studded cast. Lombino, or Hunter had several pen names John Abbott, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins, Ezra Hannon, Richard Marsten and then there’s the name he used most often, Ed McBain! As McBain he wrote the “87th Precinct” crime series. Once again his novels made their way to Television. In 1961 and 62 NBC aired a police drama called “87th Precinct”. He started writing for television in 1956 with a teleplay for \"The Kaiser Aluminum Hour\" which aired on NBC in 1956 and 57 and he wrote the story for two episodes of \"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer\" a syndicated TV show, two years later in 1958 and 59.I chose this story because it’s unusual. A story written by a writer, about a writer getting a little help from a bizarre source.Writing stories was hard work—unless Fred had a typewriter like \"Reggie\" that could write by itself!

This native New Yorker kept story ideas in a notebook before he was a teenager.Born in Utica New York on the 20th of January 1927. Like many authors of his time he served in the United States Army during World War II, he was a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne. After the war he graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in English and a minor in Psychology. Why Psychology? He said he did it so he could \"get inside the heads of the characters in his stories“. Obviously this man had a plan!Support the show - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/scottsV Merch - https://lostscifi.creator-spring.com/ Sign up for our newsletterhttps://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/266431/102592606683269000/shareAlthough we know of him because of his work as a Science Fiction author he didn’t stop there, he also wrote fantasy, horror and mysteries. He wrote more than 50 short fiction stories starting in 1951 and kept writing short sci-fi for almost 50 years. In addition to writing he was the editor of Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine from 1979 until 1985 and he was the editor and publisher of the sci-fi magazine Gamma. Gamma wasn’t exactly a success, publishing only 5 issues between 1963 and 1965. Gamma didn’t fail because of a lack of talented writers. The debut of Gamma in 1963 featured a story by Thomas Lanier Williams the 3rd, better known as American playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams. Oh and Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling also contributed stories to the magazines very first offering. A near mint condition copy of that first issue of Gamma sold not that long ago for $125, but don’t worry a slightly less pristine copy is still available if you’re an aspiring collector for only $16.I thought about buying it but shipping to Costa Rica where I have lived for the last 5 years would add another $50 and take up to month to get here.Our accomplished and successful author wrote a few provocative mystery novels, including Strip for Murder and Psycho Sinner as Eric Thomas, 7 Deadly Sinners as Christopher Sly and Negative of a Nude. He was also known to have used the pen name Chester H. Carlfi and may have written at least one novel under the House Name Troy Conway, but we don’t know for sure.His writing career began in 1951 with \"The Wallpaper\" which was published in Other Worlds magazine. His legal name is Charles Edward Fritch, but most know of him as Charles E. Fritch.You’ll find Fritch in the Internet Movie Database, also known as IMDB, thanks to a short story he wrote titled The Misfortune Cookie, which was adapted for an episode of the television series The Twilight Zone which aired in 1986.Silvia secretly planned to divorce George when they reached Arcturus.

Thanks mxsandyTodays author on Lost Sci-Fi led an interesting life. He was a popular and prolific author starting his sci-fi career with the short story Isolationist which ran in the April 1950 edition of Fantastic Adventures magazine. Fantastic Adventures got its start in 1939 and was almost cancelled in 1940 but the October issue that year had unexpectedly good sales so the magazine continued until March 1953. Our author sold another 6 stories to Fantastic Adventures in 1950 and 12 more in 1950 which were published in Out of This World Adventures, Startling Stories, Fantastic Adventures and others.A year later his first novel hit store shelves in 1951 titled The Case of the Little Green Men. It’s believed that the first use of the term Little Green Men in reference to extraterrestrials in a newspaper dates back to 1908. It can be found in the oldest newspaper in Maine the Daily Kennebec Journal. The 1951 novel The Case of the Little Green Men is available on Amazon in both paperback and Kindle formats.A decade would pass before this author would release another novel in 1961. There were 22 novels in the 60s, 35 in the 70s and 10 more in the 1980s. In addition to his almost 70 novels, he wrote almost 200 short stories.Born Dallas McCord Reynolds on November 11th, 1917, in Corcoran, California, he is best known as Mack Reynolds but like most of his successful contemporaries he had a variety of pen names, including Dallas Ross, Mark Mallory, Clark Collins, Guy McCord, Maxine Reynolds, Bob Belmont, and Todd Harding.His family moved to Baltimore in 1918 and his father became a member of the Socialist Labor Party or SLP.

Send an email to scott@lostscifi.com.Chris Williams sent us this email recently, “Hey Scott, I love the Lost Sci-Fi Podcast but you said Planet of the Apes was your favorite sci-fi franchise by far. What about Star Wars? That’s my favorite. Keep up the good work, I listen to your podcast every week!” Thanks, Chris. I do love the Star Wars movie franchise and you got me thinking. I think the reason I put Planet of the Apes as my all-time favorite sci-fi franchise is because it began when I was a little kid and I’d seen all 5 of the apes movies before Star Wars was released in 1977. I saw Star Wars just days after I graduated high school in Denison, Iowa in what is now known as the Donna Reed Theater, named after the iconic actress who was born and raised in Denison. Reed, born Donna Mullenger, starred in the 1946 Christmas classic “It’s a Wonderful Life” alongside Jimmy Stewart.Which begs the question is “It’s a Wonderful Life” a science fiction movie? Before you say no, think about it. George Bailey played by Stewart is suicidal when he’s visited by an angel when George says, “I wish I’d never been born.” The angel grants his wish and now the movie switches to an alternate timeline where George Bailey was never born! Sound like sci-fi to me. What do you think? Is “It’s a Wonderful Life” a science fiction movie? We’d love to hear your thoughts, scott@lostscifi.com.Seven years after “It’s a Wonderful Life” was released a new science fiction magazine debuted in June 1953. Science Fiction Stories Magazine would publish once in 53 and once in 54 before releasing multiple issues over the next 6 years. The inaugural issue was 132 pages and sold for 35 cents. I found a good to very good copy on sale for only $25, which sounds like a bargain to me considering it contains a remarkable short story from the amazing Philip K. Dick. Turn with me to page 127, A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically, you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this story, in just this way….From Science Fiction Stories Magazine in June 1953 The Eyes Have It by Philip K. Dick Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information."
