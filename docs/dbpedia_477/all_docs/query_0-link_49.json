        "text": "Germany’s government and the two major opposition parties are to jointly nominate former East German human rights activist Joachim Gauck to be the country’s next president.\n\nMr Gauck, 72, is a former Lutheran priest who opposed East Germany’s then-communist regime and became head of a government agency dealing with the painful past of the party’s ubiquitous domestic intelligence service after Germany’s reunification in 1990.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel told a hastily called news conference last night that her centre-right coalition government and the centre-left opposition rallied behind Mr Gauck, who was initially proposed by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens. He is not a member of any political party.\n\n“What moves me the most is that a man who was still born during the gloomy, dark war, who grew up and lived 50 years in a dictatorship ... is now called to become the head of state,” Mr Gauck said. “This is of course a very special day in my life.”\n\nMs Merkel, who also grew up in East Germany, or the GDR, said their life stories strongly connected them. “We have both spent a part of our life in the GDR and our dream of freedom has become true in 1989,” she said.\n\nThe chancellor stressed that clergymen such as Mr Gauck were at the forefront of the protests that eventually brought down the communist regime.\n\nChristian Wulff, 52, quit as president on Friday after prosecutors asked parliament to strip him of his immunity from prosecution over accusations of improper ties to businessmen.\n\nThe move followed two months of claims that he received favours and hotel stays when he was state governor of Lower Saxony.\n\nMr Wulff was Ms Merkel’s candidate when elected less than two years ago, triumphing at that time over Mr Gauck in a messy election.\n\nOpposition leader Sigmar Gabriel made a jibe at Ms Merkel at their joint news conference at Berlin’s chancellery, saying “it is now evident that all involved regret that Joachim Gauck failed to get elected (in 2010), therefore it is good that we now have him as joint candidate”.\n\nWhen Mr Wulff resigned, Ms Merkel said she would work with the Social Democrats and Greens to find a consensus candidate to succeed him.\n\nShe appeared eager to quickly resolve the troublesome issue, bringing an end to the scandal that had engulfed Mr Wulff, allowing her to refocus on fixing Europe’s debt crisis.\n\nGreens’ leader Claudia Roth said: “Joachim Gauck is someone who is able to restore radiance to democracy.”\n\nShe said he would restore respect for the presidency and dignity after the Wulff scandal.\n\nMr Gauck urged Germans not to make him out to be a “superman” or a “man without faults”, but pledged to do his utmost to restore a sense of pride to the nation, telling them they “live in a good country that they can love because it gives them the wonderful possibility to enjoy freedom in a rich life”.\n\nWhile his name widely circulated as the opposition’s favourite, it was not clear until last night whether the governing coalition would rally behind the candidate.\n\n“I’m coming right out of a plane, I was in a taxi when the chancellor called me. I haven’t even washed,” Mr Gauck said at the news conference.\n\nHe added he was still stunned by the nomination, unable to voice great joy, but “very late tonight, I will also be happy”."
