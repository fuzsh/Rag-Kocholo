        "text": "For the 19th Best Brands awards gala at the Bayerische Hof Hotel in Munich, Spark was tasked to find a keynote speaker that could inspire, and personalities that bring glamour, entertainment and insight to the audience of key decision makers from some of the world’s biggest brands and German media.\n\nJoachim Gauck, the former German President, delivered a keynote speech on tolerance, courage and responsibility that hit a nerve with the audience, who thanked him with a long standing ovation after his captivating and inspirational speech.\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger, one of Germany’s most successful footballers ever, and his wife Ana Ivanović, former number 1 tennis player, brought glamour to the event. They gave the audience an insight into what it is like working together and partnering with brands, after their individual active sports career has ended. They charmed the audience by being relatable and frank in the onstage interview with the host Linda Zervakis.\n\nSpark coordinated interviews with key media, arranged meet and greets with the shortlisted nominees in the Pearl’s Club and escorted them on the red carpet.\n\nSpark looked after all aspects of the appearances from research, negotiations, agreements, logistics, interview coordination, approval coordination for photos/interviews and looking after the personalities at the event.\n\nThe event was covered extensively by German media.
