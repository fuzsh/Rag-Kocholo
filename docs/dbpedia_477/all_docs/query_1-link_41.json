        "text": "Roman Herzog, who as Germany’s second president after reunification called for “confidence and joie de vivre” during a time of economic malaise, died on Tuesday in Bad Mergentheim, Germany. He was 82.\n\nThe death was announced by the current president, Joachim Gauck.\n\n“His forward-looking courage was combined with a charming skepticism,” Mr. Gauck said. “This combination was as unmistakable as his independent spirit and his love of direct speech.”\n\nLike his predecessor, Richard von Weizsäcker, Mr. Herzog used the presidency, which is largely a ceremonial post, to serve as a moral guardian for liberal and democratic values. He spoke often about Germany’s moral responsibility for the crimes of its past.\n\nBut at home, Mr. Herzog was best known for a 1997 speech in Berlin in which he spoke with striking candor about the structural reasons for economic malaise.\n\n“In Germany, anyone who shows initiative or — above all — wants to do things differently is in danger of drowning in a morass of well-intentioned regulations,” he said, adding that “the German mania for red tape” meant it was much more expensive to build a single-family home in Germany than in the neighboring Netherlands, even though wage levels were comparable.\n\n“A society plagued by fear becomes incapable of reform and can no longer shape its future,” he said. “Fear stifles the spirit of invention, the courage to go it alone, the hope that problems can be overcome. The German word angst has actually entered the vocabulary of the Americans and the French as symbolic of our mind-set.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
