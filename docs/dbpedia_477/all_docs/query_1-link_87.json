        "text": "Václav Havel European Dialogues with Joachim Gauck, 7 May 2014\n\nThe debate on the subject of Europe and (its) future was held as part of a state visit by the president of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck, and took place at his country’s embassy. President Gauck exchanged ideas with Petr Pithart, who for many years was chairman of the Czech Senate, while a subsequent discussion was chaired by Jacques Rupnik.\n\nThe German president ended his speech on an urgent, beseeching note: “Since 1989, Europe has been closely connected in a way we could scarcely have imagined at that time. Elections to the European Parliament are ahead of us. This is an occasion for us to consider where we are and where we are heading: How can reconciliation succeed? Where are we in terms of common values? What needs to happen for Europe to be regarded in the world as a single actor?”"
