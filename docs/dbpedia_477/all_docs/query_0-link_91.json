E. President Gauck to the development of relations between Czech and German universities in the fields of science and education. In his activities, he worked to improve mutual Czech-German dialogue, the strengthening of friendship and the development of mutual economic cooperation between the two countries in a manner unprecedented,” Charles University Rector Tomáš Zima said.\n\nA financial gift of €10,000 accompanies the international Charles IV Prize awarded to the former German president on Monday. The financial gift was presented by Milan Hašek, the Director of the Public and Non-Profit Department of Česká spořitelna (Czech Savings Bank) – a Partner of the international Charles IV Prize.\n\nNominations for the international Charles IV Prize are the competence of the Administrative Board of the Charles IV Prize, consisting of representatives of the City of Prague and Charles University.\n\nFinal nominees are confirmed by the Rector of Charles University and the Lord Mayor of the Czech capital, Prague, who then jointly announce the winner."
