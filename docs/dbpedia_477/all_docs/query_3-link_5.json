        "text": "When Joachim Gauck is elected German president on Sunday, it will go down in history as the day when East Germans were finally able to ditch the feeling of being the nation's underdogs.\n\nThe 72-year old Protestant pastor's stellar rise has established the domination of Germany's political leadership by two figures who grew up under communism in East Germany.\n\nLike the chancellor, Angela Merkel, Gauck was brought up in a Protestant household under the Communist regime. Both of them began their political careers after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe newspaper die Zeit has called it a \"perfect East German triumph\", and a sign that the often troubled integration between east and west has finally been achieved.\n\nGauck now has to bring his experience as a former East German rights activist as well as his own troubled history – his father was sent to a hard labour camp by the communist regime when he was just a boy – to the highest office in the land. He says he wants to invigorate Germans with a more positive sense of themselves, having declared his desire to \"free\" them of their \"angst\".\n\nFreedom is his favourite word and one which he has repeated throughout his career as a Protestant preacher and, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the head of the archives of the communist secret police, the Stasi, where he was responsible for sorting out the paper trail documenting their destructive deeds. The man who did not get to vote until he was 50 years old, and fittingly on 18 March, the same date as Sunday's vote, also repeatedly chides Germans for not appreciating their freedom.\n\nGermany is preparing to be \"put on the psychiatrist's couch\", according to the Spiegel, by the most philosophical figurehead the country has had in years.\n\nThe silver-haired politician says it is time Germans wake up to the fact that they have much to be proud of. \"Germans love being in the doldrums,\" he said in 2010. \"The whole country lives … in a barbaric state of vexation.\"\n\nThe charismatic Gauck, who describes himself as \"a leftwing, liberal conservative\", will become the country's ninth postwar president following the unceremonious fall from grace last month of Merkel's former ally Christian Wulff, who became caught up in a scandal over alleged corruption. But some see his appointment as a bitter blow.\n\nThe runup to his election in the Bundestag, for which he has the support of all the mainstream parties, has been tarnished by rows over everything from the extent to which he earned the title of dissident to whether he should be allowed to \"live in sin\" with his long-term partner when he moves into the presidential palace.\n\nThe most vocal opponents are members of the opposition Linke (\"Left\") party, many of whom still have their roots in the old Communist party. They have fronted their own candidate, the Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld.\n\nBut some in the East German dissident movement have also voiced their concerns. Heiko Lietz, a co-founder of the Neues Forum opposition movement, says Gauck's dissident role has been exaggerated. \"An artificial character was built up around him,\" Lietz said.\n\nHowever Johann-Georg Jaeger, also a former dissident and now a Green party member, defended Gauck's record. He recalled his bravery, describing how he gave fellow dissidents access to his photocopier – a rare thing in East Germany – for printing political pamphlets, and erected a secret letter box in his house to allow messages to be passed between dissidents.\n\nGauck has admitted to what he calls past mistakes, saying he was a latecomer to the opposition movement. He has also talked frequently about reflective periods of time he himself has spent in the analyst's chair. But he has rejected accusations from the left that he tried to relativise the Holocaust by talking about it in the same breath as Stalinism, and has so far resisted calls from the right for him to divorce his wife of 53 years and marry his long-term partner, a journalist.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the Guardian he described how the disappearance of his father following his arrest by the Communists utterly defined his political outlook.\n\n\"The fate of our father was like an educational cudgel,\" he said. \"It led to a sense of unconditional loyalty towards the family which excluded any sort of idea of fraternisation with the system.\""
