        "text": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The German Federal Foreign Office (FFO), the Goethe-Institut, and the Federation of German Industry (BDI), today announce the great successes of the Year of German-American Friendship, a year-long initiative based on the idea that the U.S. and Germany are Wunderbar Together – stronger as friends and partners. Over the past year, Wunderbar Together has reached all 50 states, brought together more than 400 partners for over 2,000 events in 560 communities, and introduced German culture to a significant segment of the American population.\n\nMichelle Müntefering, German Minister of State for International Cultural Policies, commented on the biggest public diplomacy campaign sponsored by the Federal Foreign Office so far, \"The Year of German-American Friendship has vividly illustrated the meaning of 'Wunderbar Together.' Germany and the United States share a lot – irrespective of the current political situation. We can only address the issues of globalization together – and civil society can provide important impulses for shaping the transatlantic relationship. Our task is now to continue this dialogue between our societies beyond the Year of German-American Friendship.\"\n\nFrom a PopUp Tour that visited several cities and highlighted the innovative partnership between Germany and the U.S.; to WanderbUS, an immersive traveling exhibit that educated thousands of students about German culture; to a 360° audiovisual ISM Hexadome tour across North America; and much more, the campaign effectively brought together individuals through events across various sectors, including culture, sport, business, science, and politics.\n\nOn top of over 1 million attendees reached in-person, Wunderbar Together also built a multifaceted, strong digital presence that engaged 10.1 million users online. Additional campaign highlights include:\n\nSecured approximately 235 million impressions across traditional media and owned social media channels.\n\nAmassed a following of approximately 70,000 followers across three newly created campaign social channels, receiving 518,000 social engagements across these channels.\n\nGarnered more than 200,000 website visits on WunderbarTogether.org.\n\nMedia outreach resulted in over 1,000 placements in German and U.S. publications.\n\nOf the over 2,000 events, two-thirds of events were free and open to the public, with over 300 U.S. schools involved.\n\nAs seen from these highlights, Wunderbar Together strengthened existing networks, while also bringing many Americans into the dialogue about the German-American relationship who had previously never taken part in such discussions.\n\nWith the 30th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, Wunderbar Together is closing out its campaign on a strong note to commemorate this historic moment. End of campaign programming offers opportunities for participants to meet witnesses of the Wall's destruction so they can reflect and immerse themselves in an important piece of history. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in attendance to show his dedication and support of the campaign.\n\nHighlights of these nationwide events include:\n\nClosing Concerts for the Year of German-American Friendship at the Boston Symphony Hall: As part of Leipzig Week at the Boston Symphony (October 27-November 2), the Leipzig Gewandhausorchester will perform together with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under their joint conductor, Andris Nelsons. With this highly symbolic project, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will ring in the end of the Year of German-American Friendship by attending a performance on October 31.\n\nGerman American Conference at Harvard (November 1-3): Transatlantic relations will be the topic of conversation for three days at Harvard University.
