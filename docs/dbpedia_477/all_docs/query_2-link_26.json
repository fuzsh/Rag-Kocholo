        "text": "Economic opportunities are high on the agenda as Chinese President Xi Jinping hosts a visit by German President Joachim Gauck. Gauck will spend five days in China.\n\nCCTV’s Su Yuting reports.\n\nThis is German President Gauck’s first state visit to China since taking office four years ago. It’s also his first time here in China.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping welcomed Gauck with a grand ceremony and reviewed the guard of honor.\n\nLater in their discussions, President Xi said both sides can cooperate with a third party in promoting the Belt and Road initiative, interconnectivity between Asia and Europe, as well as explore global markets. He mentioned China hopes to integrate its Belt and Road initiative with European development strategies.\n\nPresident Xi also said that China seeks international cooperation in terms of production capacity, which can then provide opportunities for Europe’s investment plans. He mentioned China’s cooperation with eastern Europe can be extended to cover the whole of Europe.\n\nPresident Gauck recalled the political and economic achievements between the two countries, and acknowledged the openness and inclusiveness of the Belt and Road initiative. He said Germany will continue its cooperation and partnership with China.\n\nThe two presidents also jointly held an opening ceremony for the Year of Germany-China Youth Exchange 2016.\n\nPresident Xi said, “I have held talks with President Gauck on consolidating and deepening Chinese-German comprehensive strategic partnership. And ensuring the success of the events in commemorating the Year of Germany-China Youth Exchange this year is the consensus reached by both of us. That will help boost friendship between our two peoples.”\n\nForeign Ministry’s officials said increasingly enhanced mutual understanding and political mutual trust is the key for bilateral ties.\n\nChina has the ‘Made in China 2025’ strategy and Germany has the ‘German Industry 4.0’ project. Both countries have placed emphasis on innovation and cooperation. This could provide more investment opportunities for German companies, and also help raise China’s industrial manufacturing to a new level."
