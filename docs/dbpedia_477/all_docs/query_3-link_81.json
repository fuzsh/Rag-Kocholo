Aquino III at the Schloss Bellevue, the official residence and presidential palace.\n\nAfter President Aquino signed the guest book, he met with the Federal President who was a former Lutheran pastor and became known as an anti-communist civil rights activist in East Germany.\n\nGermany is the biggest economy in the European Union (EU) and the fourth largest in the world. It is one of the important donors of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) for the Philippines. It has donated about P10 billion or â‚¬176 million for relief and rehabilitation efforts of typhoon Yolanda-affected areas.\n\n* * *"
