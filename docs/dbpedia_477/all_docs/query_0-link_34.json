        "text": "A New Kind of Language\n\nGauck's language sometimes sounds like a cross between the German theologian and peace activist Eugen Drewermann and Sigmund Freud. He doesn't shy away from the highly charged emotionalism of the word \"love,\" and his vocabulary is peppered with the language of areas unrelated to politics -- psychology, theology, even love poems. But in ordinary political life, where rhetoric is constantly being tested and seasoned, such language was unheard of until now.\n\nAs president, Gauck will be taking certain risks by speaking so differently and thinking so freely. In the age of cynicism and short attention spans, it won't be long before he starts irritating some people.\n\nThe greater risk is his inner independence, which stems from a personal biography that mirrors the history of the country. In the business of politics, however, control is of paramount importance. A person who says what he really thinks can be dangerous. At any rate, it is clear that Gauck not only has the gift of the gab, but also the courage to launch into wide-ranging debates.\n\nShortly after his nomination, Gauck was urged to keep a low profile until the day of his election, which meant not giving any press conferences or interviews -- in short, not ruffling any feathers. Merkel feared that dissenters from her own party could outwit her, once again, in the Federal Convention, the assembly that elects the president. Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), feared that the candidate might repeat his controversial statement that Thilo Sarrazin, the SPD politician who made inflammatory comments about Muslim immigrants, had been \"courageous.\" The Greens feared that he might say something indelicate about the controversial Stuttgart 21 railway station project or the Occupy movement. Indeed, almost all the parties that must now praise him publicly are in fact afraid of him.\n\nIn recent weeks, Gauck received a taste of his new world, one in which hidden agendas are far more important than straightforward thoughts and ideas. The man who spent so much time removing his protective shell is now entering a realm filled with wearers of shells and bulletproof glass. He will have to curtail his hard-fought freedom, both internally and externally.\n\nWhen he becomes president, experts will pay careful attention to which suit and which tie he wears to which event, and whether his shirts are pressed well enough. Gauck appeared at his last reading carrying a plastic bag with the words \"2006 Football World Cup\" written on it.\n\nGauck Faces Difficult Transition\n\nGauck is well aware of his personal problem with freedom, and it does worry him. Sitting on a barstool, he sighs and says: \"When I say to the politicians during my introductions that, as president, I'll soon be like a worn pebble, because this Sarrazin issue is haunting me, they all raise their arms and shout: 'No, no, please don't!'\" Gauck imitates the politicians and throws his arms up in the air. \"But if I say the same kinds of things I've said in the past, I'll soon be in an extremely awkward situation.\" For this reason, he says, he'll have to address the public in a different, more balanced way in the future. \"At that point, I'm no longer citizen Gauck; I'm the Federal Republic of Germany.\"\n\nWill the change be difficult for him?\n\n\"I think so,\" he says. \"I really have to work on myself, and I have to take advice from others. What's the best way to remain authentic and yet not come across as a provocateur?\"\n\nShortly after our conversation in the bar in Poland, the most popular hour of therapy begins on German television. Joachim Gauck is today's guest on the Reinhold Beckmann talk show. It's a repeat of a previous broadcast, but no one seems to notice that Gauck isn't actually live in the studio.\n\nIt's probably because Gauck is in his element when he talks about the big issues, like democracy, freedom and personal responsibility. This sense of timelessness isn't a bad quality for a president.\n\nAfter Richard von Weizsäcker, Gauck will be the first president whose pet theme is so deeply shaped by his own history. It was no accident that Weizsäcker, who knew some of the resistance fighters in the July 20 movement against Hitler and whose father was sentenced in Nuremberg for his role in the deportation of French Jews to Auschwitz, managed to find the right tone 40 years later and described Germany's capitulation as a \"day of liberation from the inhuman system of the Nazi dictatorship.\" Weizsäcker's speech was later even available as an LP record. His successors haven't managed to match his impact.\n\nBut as with all people who are interested in the great questions of mankind, Gauck has a tendency to downplay everyday problems. For a man like Gauck, who spent 50 years of his life yearning for a free society, questions relating to commuting allowances or unemployment benefits seem banal.\n\nFreedom Mantra May Turn People Off\n\nThis is the flipside of a passionate approach to politics that draws heavily on personal experiences. People like Gauck are always suspected of trying to force their personal approach to life onto others. An unemployed person who is constantly looking for work and unable to find it will have little use for Gauck's talk about freedom. Gauck will have to be a president for everyone. The trick will be to avoid becoming like everyone else.\n\nIn his autobiography, Gauck described the danger involved in idealizing Western freedom, from the point of view of an East German citizen. \"The West was like a woman a 17-year-old would put on a pedestal and worship. Many of us didn't see, or only saw as if looking through a veil, the wrinkles and abysses, the deficiencies and curtailments of freedom.\"\n\nJust how much his enthusiasm about freedom continues to inspire him today is evident during a morning speech he gives in the large lecture hall at the University of Lodz. As is often the case when he talks about freedom, he attaches his gaze to the back of the room, where the ceiling and the back wall come together, as if to mark a shining horizon.\n\nIn his speech, Gauck praises Poland as a model, because it made its call for freedom heard earlier than in other countries of Eastern Europe. He praises Poland as a country \"that gave priority to freedom over security in its history,\" and whose citizens decidedly value less government than more government.\" This Poland, he says, can take away some of the Germans' fears and give them courage. \"In my opinion, there is far less worry and depression here than in Germany.\"\n\nIn Germany, where the strong state is experiencing a renaissance as a result of the financial and currency crises, Gauck's presidency will likely be an exciting experiment. Until now, German presidents have tried to give a voice to the intellectual mainstream in their speeches. Gauck, in contrast, advocates resisting the \"power of a trendy zeitgeist\" and argues for less government. Unlike the very German notion that everything will improve once society has been changed, Gauck's approach resembles the credo of many therapists: You will not change the society in which you live. You can only change yourself.\n\nFear is a 'German National Culture'\n\nIn the lecture hall in Lodz, Gauck quotes \"The Fear of Freedom\" by psychologist Erich Fromm, which he almost always quotes. Germans are good at being afraid, he explains to the Poles. In fact, he says, one could almost call it a \"German national culture.\" He smiles sardonically as he speaks. \"The German feels particularly well when he feels unwell.\"\n\nJust as Gauck once overcame his own despondency and depression, he now wants to encourage an entire nation to embark on the same process. He wants the Germans to stop being afraid of freedom, of the complexity of an open society, and of the diversity of options.\n\nHe wants to lead them out of their middle-class lethargy and encourage them to become involved and participate in the tedious game of democracy, which is suffering, not as much as a result of the quality of its politicians but the laziness of its participants: citizens. Happiness, says Gauck, can only arise from responsibility and commitment, not from apathy.\n\nIt's become late in the bar in Lodz. It is time for Gauck to return to Germany, and his staff members are urging him to wrap up the conversation. But he has one more thing to say. He finds it difficult, he says, to describe his current situation and his feelings without seeming corny. \"It is the autumn of my life, and autumn is the time when churches hold their harvest festivals. I have a feeling of astonishment and gratitude, and yet I am not overcome by fears. This is such a major position, and one can make so many mistakes in it. But I am grounded differently today. I now know that this is the way things are, and that I haven't pushed it.\"\n\nIs the presidency the culmination of his life? \"Yes, it certainly is,\" says Gauck. He gets up and is about to go before adding one more observation: \"But that doesn't mean that one is automatically pleased to be experiencing this climax.\"\n\nGauck knows that happiness, like freedom, translates into hard work. He gets into the car and is off to Berlin."
