        "text": "A German court has cleared the country's former president Christian Wulff of corruption.\n\n\"The accused Wulff has been found not guilty,\" presiding judge Frank Rosenow told Hanover's state court.\n\nHe added that Mr Wulff was entitled to compensation for police searches during the investigation.\n\nHe was once a deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party and her choice for the largely ceremonial role of president.\n\nThe former head of state resigned two years ago over the allegations he illegally accepted favourable loan and hotel stays from friends when he was governor of the state of Lower Saxony, before becoming president in 2010.\n\nThe charges related specifically to some 720 euros ($990; Â£600) in hotel and entertainment costs allegedly paid by German film producer David Groenewold for Mr Wulff and his family during a visit to Oktoberfest in Munich in 2008.\n\nIn return, he was accused of having lobbied German companies to support Mr Groenewold's work. He had faced up to three years in jail, if convicted."
