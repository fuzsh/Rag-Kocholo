        "text": "Washington\n\nIF everything goes according to plan, on Sunday Germany will swear in Joachim Gauck as its 11th postwar president.\n\nThe choice of Mr. Gauck, a pastor known for his anti-Communist activism under the East German government, couldn’t come at a better time. Germany is playing the bad cop in the European Union’s efforts to manage the Continent’s debt crisis, and anti-German sentiment, particularly in southern Europe, is high. That in turn is pushing the German public away from spending more to help out its indebted neighbors, even as the country’s economy pushes it into a position of unrivaled power in Europe.\n\nGermany is at a crossroads: become the Continent’s leader or be seen as the neighborhood bully. In a stroke of fortune, it is about to install, as its next president, a man known more for his integrity and moral leadership than for his political acumen, a man who can help make sure his country follows the first course.\n\nMr. Gauck’s election by the Federal Convention, made up of the lower house of the Parliament and representatives of the 16 German states, is a foregone conclusion, having been negotiated beforehand by the leading parties. The ceremonial nature of the vote underlines the impression that the president’s role is largely invisible.\n\nBut the president’s position inside Germany is unique: by design and tradition, it embodies the conscience of the nation. For over 60 years, the German president has often been a rudder in times of stress and, as frequently happens with the Germans, in moments of disorientation about their place in the world.\n\nAnd yet the last two presidents, Horst Köhler and Christian Wulff, have resigned under clouds, Mr. Köhler over some ill-chosen words about Germany’s role in Afghanistan and Mr. Wulff in the face of corruption allegations.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
