        "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she backs Joachim Gauck, a pastor and former East German rights activist, to be the country's next president.\n\nMr Gauck was proposed by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens after Christian Wulff quit as president on Friday over corruption allegations.\n\nMrs Merkel opposed Mr Gauck for the presidency in 2010, instead supporting her ally Mr Wulff.\n\nGermany's president has a largely ceremonial, but influential, role.\n\nWith the backing of all the major parties, Mr Gauck's election to the position next month should be a formality.\n\nIn 2010, he was the presidential candidate of the Social Democrats and Greens, but lost to Mr Wulff.\n\nThe 72-year-old Mr Gauck is well known for his work as a dissident in East Germany and for running the archives on the Stasi secret police after the Berlin Wall came down, exposing its crimes."
