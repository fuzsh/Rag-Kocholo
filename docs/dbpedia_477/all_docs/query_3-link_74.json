His main rival, veteran anti-Nazi campaigner Beate Klarsfeld, got 126 votes.\n\nGermans hope Gauck, a prominent player in the peaceful protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, can restore dignity to the presidency, a post tarnished by financial scandals that toppled his predecessor Christian Wulff.\n\n\"I take up this post with the endless gratitude of a person who, after a long trek through the political desert of the 20th century, has finally and unexpectedly found his home again and was able to witness in the last 20 years the joy of shaping a democratic society,\" he said after taking the oath of office.\n\nHis victory was never in doubt after all the main political parties, including Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats, threw their weight behind his candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerkel played down suggestions that the feisty theologian would use his office as a pulpit to harangue Germany's politicians or that they might clash over policy issues.\n\n\"He may well disapprove of something, so might I, but we are all adults... I think there will be good collaboration,\" she told reporters after giving Gauck a large bouquet of flowers.\n\nGauck struck a similar tone in an interview for ARD channel.\n\n\"I have offered her (Merkel) my trust, my sincerity and loyalty. We have looked each other in the eye and I see no grounds for mistrust,\" Gauck said.\n\nMerkel can ill afford disputes with the president as she tries to build cross-party support for tighter fiscal rules to tackle the euro zone's two-year sovereign debt crisis that has forced Germany to assume greater leadership in Europe.\n\nANTAGONIST?\n\nMerkel only reluctantly endorsed Gauck's candidacy after her coalition ally, the Free Democrats, joined opposition parties last month in backing him to replace the disgraced Wulff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike career politician Wulff, Gauck - who describes himself politically as \"a left-leaning, liberal conservative\" - likes to speak his mind on controversial issues, and he does so with an eloquence forged in the pulpits of East Germany.\n\n\"The new president will polarise the republic with his views about freedom,\" the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel said in an article stressing his deep attachment to individual liberty.\n\n\"Unlike his predecessor, Gauck does not intend to kowtow to political conventions. He will thereby inevitably become an antagonist of the chancellor,\" said Spiegel.\n\nEighty percent of Germans trust Gauck, according to an opinion poll by Infratest, yet two thirds said they thought he would be an \"uncomfortable\" president for the political parties.\n\n\"The president of the federal republic must be the guardian of the soul of our nation,\" said Sunday's edition of the top-selling daily Bild which also backed Gauck for the job in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Gauck's most important task is to restore dignity to this considerably tarnished office.\"\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy, a key euro zone ally of Merkel, praised Gauck's commitment to freedom and democracy in a letter of congratulation to the new German head of state.\n\nGauck said he hoped to pay his first visit as president to Poland, another important neighbour with which Merkel has forged close political and economic ties within the EU.\n\nMerkel and Gauck both hail from old East Germany where her father was also a clergyman. They are said to have a good personal rapport, but she blocked a bid to install him as president in 2010 in favour of the ill-fated Wulff.\n\nCOLOURFUL PAST\n\nGauck has a rich life story shaped by the Cold War. When he was 11 his father was sent to the Siberian Gulag for alleged espionage and did not return for four years.\n\nThat experience fostered an abiding aversion to totalitarianism, and he has said freedom will be the leitmotif of his presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the fall of Communism and Germany's reunification, Gauck oversaw the archives of the dreaded Stasi, the East German secret police, earning recognition for exposing their crimes.\n\nHe ensured that the files were used to root out former Stasi employees and collaborators in public service and to understand the country's past.\n\nMore recently, he has had to defend his decision to keep former Stasi employees working at the archives, workers whose insider knowledge made them, he thought, \"indispensable\"."
