        "text": "Throughout these developments, there have been three constants in the relationship between Berlin and Beijing: mutual respect, pragmatism and the absolute will to benefit from each other.\n\nNothing underscores the latter so much as the economic links that both countries have enjoyed. To illustrate: in 1972, the total value of trade between the two was €500,000 (US$486,000). In 2021 it was €245 billion (US$237 billion).\n\nUnsurprisingly, China was Germany’s most important trading partner for the sixth year in a row in 2021. Meanwhile, no other European country invests as much in China as Germany, with German firms accounting for more than half of European investment in China in 2018.\n\nThis win-win situation did not arise overnight, but rather resulted from an extensive process of exchange, dialogue and diplomacy between both nations. In 2004, Berlin and Beijing established a “partnership of global responsibility” and created a mechanism for holding annual meetings, with the goal of widening bilateral relations to new areas.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, both sides conducted annual consultations to further deepen their relationship. And 2014 marked the evolution of the 2004 “strategic partnership” into a “comprehensive strategic partnership”.\n\nLogically, the solution would be to intensify dialogue at the highest level, an approach that made the relations as we know them today possible. The list of frequent visits between presidents, chancellors and foreign ministers over the years is extensive.\n\nUnforgettable is Helmut Schmidt’s meeting with Mao Zedong in 1975. Until his death, Schmidt was the German chancellor who perhaps best recognised China’s relevance and advocated in favour of building bridges with Beijing instead of tearing them down.\n\nMoreover, global geopolitical tensions put Germany in a tough spot as China’s rise coincides with Washington’s fear of changing the unipolar world order. In Berlin, the government seems to believe there is a binary choice to be made: either stand with its most important economic partner in Beijing or its most powerful ally in Washington.\n\nThe fact that Germany seeks to rebalance its relationship with China half a century after establishing official relations is not wrong per se. Circumstances have certainly changed. However, the current government attempts to lecture China into a transformation that remains wishful thinking, thereby impairing a foundation that has ensured both sides 50 years of growth and prosperity.\n\nMaintaining and further expanding friendly and cooperative relations between Berlin and Beijing will benefit both nations and their people – particularly in these challenging times – and can champion peace, stability and development in this turbulent world for the next half-century."
