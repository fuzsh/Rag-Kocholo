        "text": "Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan met with former President of Germany Joachim Gauck, who is in Armenia on a private visit.\n\nWelcoming Mr. Gauck’s visit to Armenia, the Prime Minister said he was happy to host him in our country. “You are perceived in Armenia as a friend of our people, and this is not accidental as it stems from your activities. We have recorded that your statement in 2015 on the Armenian Genocide became the starting point for the German Bundestag to adopt a resolution on Genocide recognition,” the Premier said, highlighting the ex-President’s activity in the sphere of human rights.\n\nNikol Pashinyan noted that drastic democratic changes have occurred in Armenia following the peaceful, velvet and democratic revolution of 2018. “Many people keep asking how the revolution took place with no casualties. The answer is simple: our revolution was based on Christian values which helped make changes without shocks,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nComing to Armenian-German relations, Nikol Pashinyan hailed their development dynamics. Top-level visits were reciprocated over the past one year. In this context, the Armenian Premier highlighted the drastic growth in the number of German tourists.\n\n“I highly appreciate the attitude shown by the German Chancellor to those changes underway in Armenia, which adds an important human factor to the Armenian-German relations. I am convinced that your visit will improve the relationships between our two countries,” Nikol Pashinyan pointed out.\n\nIn turn, Joachim Gauck thanked Nikol Pashinyan for the warm welcome. “Mr. Prime Minister, your remarks come to highlight the importance of my visit. It is crucial for the German society to state and deeply understand the fact of the Armenian Genocide. We are impressed with the fact that fundamental changes are taking place in Armenia aimed at strengthening the rule of law, based on democratic values,” he said, adding that Armenia’s historical mission should be to build a real democracy in this region. He said the EU has the political will to support the development of Armenia’s legal system and strengthen the rule of law in the country.\n\nPrime Minister Pashinyan noted that his government’s greatest mission is to change of fate of Armenia and its people."
