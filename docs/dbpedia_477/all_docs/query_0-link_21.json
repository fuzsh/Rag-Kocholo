        "text": "German President Joachim Gauck will not stand for a second term as head of state next February, he announced Monday.\n\nThe former Lutheran pastor and civil rights activist in communist East Germany was elected in 2012, as a nonpartisan candidate with support from all mainstream parties.\n\nThe 76-year-old said his age was a major factor in his decision, adding: “I am conscious that the time between the 77th and the 82nd year of life is not the same as what I am experiencing now.”\n\n”Our country has engaged citizens and functioning institutions. A change in the office of president, in this Germany, is therefore not a reason to worry, it is part of the normal democratic process,” Gauck said.\n\nHis decision not to run again, however, creates a difficult situation for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will have to find someone to replace him in the run-up to Germany’s general elections in September 2017.\n\nPossible candidates include the president of the Bundestag, Norbert Lammert, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who are both from Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), and the senior lawmaker from the Bavarian conservative CSU, Gerda Hasselfeldt.\n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, the popular foreign minister from the Social Democrats (SPD), could also be a contender, though his candidacy would be difficult to accept for the CDU and CSU."
