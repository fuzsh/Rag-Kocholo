        "text": "On Oct. 6, University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann and Perry World House will host Joachim Gauck, president of the Federal Republic of Germany, for a public lecture on shared U.S.–German values.\n\nGauck’s lecture, “Freedom – our shared bond,” will be at 10:30 a.m. in the Hall of Flags in Houston Hall, 3417 Spruce St. Gutmann will introduce President Gauck. The address is on the record and open to the public, but pre-registration is required, and space is limited.\n\n“We are deeply honored to have President Gauck visit our campus,” Gutmann said. “He is a highly respected advocate of freedom and democratic principles, and brings a unique perspecitve to his talk given the current political challenges unfolding in Europe. I know his insights will be a source of inspiration to our students, faculty and staff.”\n\nGauck was elected by the Federal Convention on March 18, 2012, at which time he became the eleventh president of the Federal Republic of Germany. He gained prominence in German politics for his involvement in the opposition in the German Democratic Republic and the quest for freedom, democracy and human rights. A pastor for many years, he was one of the initiators of the church and popular resistance to the communist regime in the GDR, leading weekly prayers for peace that led to protest demonstrations.\n\nGauck’s commitment to human rights and democracy is reflected in the roles that he has held, including chairman of the special committee overseeing the dissolution of the Ministry of State Security, the Federal Commissioner for the Files of the State Security Service of the former GDR, German member of the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, chairman of the Association “Gegen Vergessen – Für Demokratie” (Against Oblivion – For Democracy), and now president.\n\nPerry World House is the University of Pennsylvania’s new university-wide hub for global engagement and interdisciplinary international policy research. Perry World House will connect Penn to the international policy world through public programming, such as Joachim Gauck’s address, and bring the University’s intellectual resources to bear on the urgent global challenges of the 21st century. Perry World House itself, an extraordinary new building at 38th Street and Locust Walk, will open its doors formally in the spring of 2016. Even before moving into its new building, Perry World House is leading Penn’s growing international engagement with a robust agenda of programming during the 2015-16 year.\n\nPre-registration is required at http://GermanPresidentatPenn.eventbrite.com. Doors will open at 9:00 a.m.; no admittance will be allowed after 10:15 a.m. Space is limited. Government-issued photo ID is required, and large bags are prohibited."
