        "text": "BEIJING — Four days before President Joachim Gauck of Germany began his first state visit to China on Sunday, the exiled writer Liao Yiwu visited Schloss Bellevue, the presidential residence in Berlin.\n\nMr. Liao, a former political prisoner who fled China in 2011, had a list of six names and a request for Mr. Gauck: Raise the plight of political prisoners when you meet Chinese leaders.\n\nAnd that is what he did during his five-day visit, which took him to Beijing, Shanghai and Xi’an and ends late on Thursday, according to his spokeswoman, Ferdos Forudastan.\n\n“In his political discussions, he talked about several people who are in prison,” Ms. Forudastan said, adding that the only name she could disclose was that of the journalist Gao Yu, who wrote for the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle and was imprisoned last year on charges of revealing state secrets, but then released on medical parole after an international outcry.\n\nBy raising the cases of political prisoners, Mr. Gauck, a former Lutheran pastor and civil society activist in East Germany who opposed the Communist state, stands out among foreign leaders who have tended to avoid human rights issues, chasing trade instead, said Tienchi Martin-Liao, the president of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, who is based in Germany.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
