        "text": "DAVOS, Switzerland — German President Joachim Gauck warned Wednesday against establishing upper limits on the number of refugees that Germany should accept.\n\n“There is no magical or mathematical formula for the ability to absorb (migrants). Instead, it is subject to a permanent process of negotiation in society and politics,” he said in a speech of the World Economic Forum. “What we can and want afford today would not have been possible 10, 20 years ago.”\n\nGauck’s speech marked the first time he addressed an international audience on migration. By rejecting ongoing calls from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Bavarian allies to place a limit on refugees, Gauck backed the government line: Europe should stem the influx by securing the EU’s external borders, not by closing Germany’s borders to its neighbors.\n\nGauck said he was aware of “increasing voices that no longer want to exclude a national border security regime,” if the security of external borders can’t be achieved.\n\n“The loss of freedom of movement would not be a good solution — for us Germans, for Europe as a whole,” he said. “Should we really not succeed to come up something better?”\n\nStill, Gauck said, reducing the number of migrants who arrive in Germany “can morally and politically be necessary to preserve the capacity of the state. It may also be necessary in order to secure support for a humane reception of refugees.”\n\nGauck told the Davos audience that he knew what they were thinking of the Germans — and he was not talking about a new analysis that ranked Germany as the “best country in the world.”\n\n“I know many of you, who look at Germany from outside, sense the attitude that many Germans showed in the summer and fall of 2015 was exuberance or naiveté,” said Gauck, adding that German openness comes from both historic lessons learned and from many younger people’s “positive experience as Europeans and citizens of the world.”\n\nGauck called for other European countries to show similar openness, in a discreet rebuke of Eastern European countries that have resisted accepting migrants."
