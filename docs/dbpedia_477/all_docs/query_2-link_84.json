        "text": "Germany rebounded to become the continent's economic giant, and a prime mover of European cooperation. With the end of the Cold War, the two parts of the country were once again united, although the economy of the former east continues to lag behind that of the former west.\n\nOverview\n\nOverview\n\nFacts\n\nLeaders\n\nMedia\n\nDome of the Reichstag rises over Germany's resurgent capital, Berlin\n\nGermany's economic success since World War II is to a large extent built on its potent export industries, fiscal discipline and consensus-driven industrial relations and welfare policies. It is particularly famed for its high-quality and high-tech goods.\n\nGermany's export-dependent economy was initially hit hard by the global financial crisis of 2008-9, which triggered the worst recession since 1949. But by 2010, its exports had helped the country to rebound more robustly than most other EU members.\n\nHowever, an ageing population has led to concern over the continued viability of Germany's high welfare and health spending. There is also a debate about how to improve integration of the many post-war immigrants whose labour helped fuel the economic boom.\n\nIn addition, what was once the German Democratic Republic, the former Soviet-dominated east, has struggled to catch up with the more affluent west after reunification, while people in west had to pay a higher than expected financial price.\n\nThe pain of Germany's Nazi-era history remains a sensitive element in the country's collective modern-day psyche. Out of the devastation of World War II grew an awareness of the need to guard against any such catastrophe recurring on the continent.\n\nIn the 1950s Germany was one of the six founding nations in the original European Economic Community from which the European Union was eventually to develop and in which Germany is a key player. Franco-German cooperation was central to European economic integration in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nAfter decades of lagging behind its economic strength, Germany's international profile has been growing. The country sent peacekeepers to the Balkans and its forces have been involved in operations in Afghanistan.\n\nThe country has famous beer brewing traditions. Beer purity laws dating back to 1516 limit the fermentation ingredients to malted grain, hops, yeast and water.\n\nAs the birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms, among others, Germany's gift to European classical music is colossal, while Goethe, Heine, Kant and Thomas Mann are giants in the world of letters and philosophy.\n\nFacts\n\nOverview\n\nFacts\n\nLeaders\n\nMedia\n\nLeaders\n\nOverview\n\nFacts\n\nLeaders\n\nMedia\n\nPresident: Joachim Gauck\n\nMr Gauck describes himself as a \"liberal left conservative\"\n\nJoachim Gauck, a human-rights campaigner and former East German dissident, became president in March 2012.\n\nThe opposition Social Democrats and Greens nominated him after the resignation of President Christian Wulff in February over a housing loan scandal, and the governing centre-right coaltion parties agreed to support him.\n\nMr Gauck stood for the largely ceremonial presidency in 2010, losing to the government's preferred candidate Mr Wulff.\n\nMr Gauck, like the Christian Democrat chancellor, Angela Merkel, has a background in the Lutheran Church in East Germany - he was a pastor there, as was Mrs Merkel's father.\n\nAn active anti-Communist from an early age whose father was exiled to a Soviet forced-labour camp for several years, Mr Gauck was a leader of the opposition New Forum in the last days of the East German dictatorship.\n\nHe served in the first and last democratic East German parliament, which put him in charge of investigating the archives of the Stasi secret police.\n\nHe continued this task after the reunification of Germany, earning the admiration of all but diehard Communists for his work in exposing the crimes of the Communist era.\n\nMr Gauck describes himself as a \"liberal left conservative\", and has expressed support for the policies of both Social-Democrat and Christian-Democrat coalition governments on a non-partisan basis.\n\nIn recent years he has concentrated on campaigning against both left and right extremist threats to Germany's democratic system.\n\nBorn in Rostock in 1940, Mr Gauck has four children by his wife, from whom he is separated. His partner since 2000 is the journalist Daniela Schadt, who will take on the ceremonial duties of First Lady.\n\nChancellor: Angela Merkel\n\nAngela Merkel, Germany's first female chancellor, swept back to power in general elections in September 2009.\n\nAs the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Angela Merkel wields considerable power\n\nMrs Merkel, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), first took office in an 2005. As a result of the vote's close result, she became chancellor in a \"grand coalition\" involving the CDU, its Christian Social Union (CSU) allies and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\n\nIn 2009, her party secured another four-year mandate with enough votes to dump the previous awkward coalition with the SPD in favour of an alliance with the smaller, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).\n\nThe coalition faced the tough challenge of dealing with the fallout from the 2008 global economic crisis. Mrs Merkel won plaudits for her calm handling of the situation, but her ability to weather a storm was put to an even more severe test once the full scale of the crisis in the eurozone began to emerge early in 2010.\n\nAs one of the richer countries in the EU, Germany was faced with the prospect of having to make huge contributions to bailouts for debt-ridden countries such as Greece, and popular resentment over this triggered a political backlash at home.\n\nIn May 2010, Mrs Merkel's coalition lost a key regional vote, and with it her majority in the powerful upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat. The following March, her party also lost the key state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, traditionally a CDU stronghold.\n\nIn December 2011, Mrs Merkel told the Bundestag that Europe was working towards setting up a fiscal union in a bid to resolve the debt crisis. But she also also reiterated her opposition to the European Central Bank issuing \"eurobonds\" backed by all eurozone members.\n\nAngela Merkel became leader of the CDU in 2000 after her predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble resigned in connection with the party funding scandal that also tainted her long-time mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nShe was born in Hamburg in 1954 but grew up in East Germany where her father was a Protestant clergyman. She holds a doctorate in physics.\n\nShe divorced her first husband Ulrich Merkel in 1982 and has been married to publicity-shy chemistry professor Joachim Sauer since 1998. She has no children.\n\nMedia\n\nOverview\n\nFacts\n\nLeaders\n\nMedia\n\nGermany's competitive television market is the largest in Europe, with some 34 million TV households.\n\nMajor TV networks use cable and satellite to reach viewers\n\nThe many regional and national public broadcasters - organised in line with the federal political structure - vie for audiences with powerful commercial operators. Each of the 16 regions regulates its own private and public broadcasting.\n\nAround 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, and viewers enjoy a comprehensive mix of free-to-view public and commercial channels. This has acted as a brake on the development of pay-TV.\n\nGermany is home to some of the world's largest media conglomerates, including Bertelsmann and the publisher Axel Springer. Some of Germany's top free-to-air commercial TV networks are owned by ProSiebenSat1, a consortium led by a US billionnaire.\n\nGermany has completed the switch to digital terrestrial TV broadcasting. Public broadcasters ZDF and ARD offer a range of digital-only channels.\n\nWhile the press and broadcasters are free and independent, the display of swastikas and statements endorsing Nazism are illegal.\n\nThere are several national newspapers, but the press market is strongest at a regional level, with more than 300 titles. Bild tabloid is the best-selling daily.\n\nBy March 2011 nearly 80% of Germans - 65.1 million people - were online, Internetworldstats reported. The leading social network is Facebook, with more than 20 million users. Its rivals include wer-kennt-wen and meinVZ.\n\nThe press\n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung - prestigious daily\n\nSueddeutsche Zeitung - Munich-based daily\n\nDie Welt - Berlin-based daily\n\nFrankfurter Rundschau - Frankfurt am Main-based daily\n\nHandelsblatt - Duesseldorf-based financial daily\n\nFinancial Times Deutschland - Hamburg-based financial daily\n\nFocus - weekly news magazine\n\nDer Spiegel - news weekly, English-language site\n\nDie Zeit - weekly\n\nBild - mass-circulation daily\n\nThe Local - Berlin-based, English-language\n\nTelevision\n\nARD - organisation of regional public broadcasters; operates Das Erste, the main national public TV channel\n\nZDF - operates second national public TV channel\n\nn-tv - commercial, rolling-news\n\nN24 - commercial, rolling news\n\nRTL - major commercial broadcaster, operates entertainment channels\n\nDeutsche Welle TV - Germany's international TV service, in German, English, Spanish\n\nSky - pay-TV operator\n\nRadio\n\nARD - umbrella organisation of public radio services, including those of individual regions\n\nDeutschlandradio - operates national public stations Deutschlandfunk and Deutschlandradio Kultur, both offering current affairs and cultural programmes\n\nDeutsche Welle - international radio broadcaster, services in many languages\n\nNews agency\n\nDeutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa)"
