        "text": "“Without the Reformation, Germany would have become a different country”, the President of Germany, Joachim Gauck, said in Wittenberg.\n\nGauck highlighted the importance of the 16th century Protestant Reformation in a speech addressing the participants of the World Lutheran Federation convention.\n\nThe Martin Luther´s Bible translation made it possible for “the people to understand one another, in a literal way; and this helped them to identify as Germans”, Gauck said.\n\nThe language of this first translation of the Scripture united the society then, and continues to be essential in the integration of people in the 21st century, the German President added.\n\nGAUCK: “PRIESTHOOD OF ALL BELIEVERS BRINGS FREEDOM”\n\nIn his speech, Joachim Gauck also said Luther’s reflection on the “priesthood of all believers” led to discover the individual value of every person before God. This understanding brings individual freedom, the German President said.\n\n“The freedom of which Luther spoke is a gift which is not tied to our deeds. God accepted human beings unconditionally”, he concluded.\n\nGauck is not the only German political leader that has openly spoken about the Christian faith. Chancellor Angela Merkel recently called Christians to be more outspoken. She has also spoken about how faith influences her political decisions."
