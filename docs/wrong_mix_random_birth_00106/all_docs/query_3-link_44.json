        "meta_description": "Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park in rural Central Kentucky is the first memorial to honor the 16th president of the United States. The park preserves two farm areas where Lincoln lived as a child: the birthplace and the boyhood home sites. Visitors can view a replica of the cabin where Lincoln was born, which is enshrined inside a memorial building. They can also tour Knob Creek Farm, where Lincoln lived from ages 2-8, and see a historic tavern and log cabin. The park offers hiking trails and picnic areas for visitors to enjoy. The park provides essential information for planning a visit and offers opportunities for volunteering and community partnerships. It is a popular destination, attracting around 200,000 visitors annually.",
