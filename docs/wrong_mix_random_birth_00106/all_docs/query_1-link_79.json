        "text": "Abraham Lincoln Birthplace: Relive his life on the frontier\n\nJackie Harley vividly remembers traveling to Hodgenville, Ky., when she was 12 to visit Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park on a family vacation.\n\n\"I remember thinking it was quite awesome,\" said Harley, who was a history buff even as a young girl. \"I remember being able to imagine what it must have been like.\"\n\nNow, Harley brings her students from nearby Abraham Lincoln Elementary School to the park at least once a year to teach them about the nation's 16th president and Kentucky history.\n\nAside from taking regular field trips to the park, during which students dress in period clothing, Harley spends her summers working at the park developing activities to help teachers educate their students.\n\nHarley's favorite part of the park is the boyhood home, about 10 miles from the main birthplace memorial and visitor's center. The landscape remains much the same as it did when Lincoln lived there. The cabin on the property is original to the period but wasn't where Lincoln lived.\n\nPart of the appeal of the park, said Bill Justice, superintendent of the park, is that \"arguably the greatest president of the United States started his life here. It's a touchstone to the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's journey through life.\"\n\nJustice said Lincoln's home \"speaks to the American experience\" of a family who \"scratched out a living on the farm\" and then a young man going off to get an education and eventually becoming president.\n\n\"He's a heroic figure,\" Justice said. \"And people connect to that.\"\n\nHalladay also reports for The (Louisville) Courier-Journal.\n\n***\n\nAbout the park\n\nSize: 345 acres\n\nVisitors: 169,515 in 2012\n\nEstablished: 1916\n\nHistory: The park was established through private donations and designated as a park run by the War Department, like the battlefield sites. It was transferred to the National Parks system in 1933.\n\nWhen visiting: Birthplace: 2995 Lincoln Farm Road, Hodgenville, Ky., 42748. Call (270) 358-3137. Boyhood home unit: 7120 Bardstown Road, Hodgenville, Ky., 42748."
