In 1782 Captain Abraham Lincoln brought his family through the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky which was still part of Virginia. Kentucky entered the union as the 15th state in 1792.\n\nIn 1786, shortly after settling in this new land, Captain Abraham Lincoln was shot by an Indian. This was a defining event in young Thomas Lincoln’s life. At the time of his father’s death, Mordecai Lincoln, the oldest son, inherited his father’s entire estate, leaving Thomas and his older brother to fend for themselves. There is no indication that Thomas Lincoln ever resented his brother’s good fortune or spent much time brooding over his fate. After his father’s death, Thomas moved with his mother to Washington County.\n\nNancy Hanks was also born in Virginia, the daughter of Lucy Shipley and James Hanks. When Nancy’s father died her mother moved with other family members to Kentucky. Eventually, Nancy went to live in Washington County and was a neighbor of Thomas Lincoln. On June 12, 1806 Nancy Hanks and Thomas Lincoln were married near Springfield, Kentucky.\n\nThomas and Nancy Lincoln Settle on Sinking Spring Farm\n\nAfter their wedding, Nancy and Thomas moved to Elizabethtown near his carpenter shop and in the vicinity of the Mill Creek Farm which he had purchased in 1803. In February of 1807 a daughter, Sarah, was born. Thomas Lincoln was known and respected as a steady worker, and his dedication paid off by 1808, when he and Nancy purchased the Sinking Spring Farm for $200 cash from Isaac Bush.\n\nWith Nancy expecting her second child, the Lincoln family moved into a cabin somewhere in the vicinity of a knoll by the Sinking Spring, a reliable source of fresh water where Abraham Lincoln probably took his first drink.\n\nThe Lincolns had chosen well and had every reason to expect a prosperous future. Although they moved into a one room cabin probably no more than 16 by 20 feet with only one window and one door, they would have brought with them items from Elizabethtown that made the new home comfortable. They still owned a farm in Elizabethtown and Thomas’ skills as a carpenter would guarantee any furniture items the family wanted. Nancy was reputed to be a talented spinner who could spin and weave clothing for her husband and young children.\n\nThomas, like other settlers in the area would have planted corns, beans, squash, and pumpkins. He probably had a few head of livestock. This young family had every reason to rejoice upon the prospects of their future when a son, Abraham, named for his paternal grandfather, was born February 12, 1809.\n\nLegal Problems with the Sinking Spring Farm\n\nIn 1786 a large track of land which included the Sinking Spring Farm was purchased by Richard Mather, a land speculator from New York. He later began to sell tracts of this land to settlers coming into Kentucky. David Vance bought the 300 acre Sinking Spring Farm in 1805 with an agreement that Mather would hold a lien on the land until the entire sum was paid in full. In the same year Vance signed the bond over to Isaac Bush, who then signed it over to Thomas Lincoln. When no one paid the debt, Mather brought suit against Vance, Bush, and the Lincolns. Vance had disappeared, leaving Isaac Bush and Thomas Lincoln to answer for the bill. After a lengthy court battle the court decided in favor of Mather and the land was offered for sale by auction.\n\nHistorians question why Thomas Lincoln and his family did not move back to Elizabethtown where they owned the Mill Creek Farm instead of leasing land in the Knob Creek Valley. It is possible the title for the Elizabethtown property was also in question. Deputy surveyors using less than perfect techniques, possessing poor math skills, and using trees, rocks, and creeks as survey markers contributed to the problems with obtaining clear title to land. Land surveys were sent to a land office in Richmond, Virginia, but problems with mail delivery meant many claims could not be substantiated. It was common in Kentucky for those who purchased property in good faith to later find they did not have a clear title to their land.\n\nThe Lincoln Farm Association\n\nLocal and national efforts to commemorate Lincoln in Kentucky lagged behind endeavors taken by New York, Illinois and in Washington, D.C. Popular feelings toward Lincoln, during and immediately after the Civil War were mixed in Kentucky. In 1861 when the Union flag flew over the Kentucky state capitol many southern supporters, including the governor, left the state.\n\nAs the Centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth approached, interest in his birthplace grew, especially the interest of a few entrepreneurs. In 1894, Alfred W. Dennett, who planned to build a hotel and park on the historic spot, bought the Sinking Spring Farm from Richard Creal. Dennett purchased a cabin from John Davenport and erected it near the Sinking Spring in November 1895. Efforts to bring people to this remote location failed. In 1897 Dennett dismantled the cabin and took it on tour. Eventually, the logs were put into storage in College Point, Long Island. When Dennett went bankrupt, 110 acres of the Sinking Spring Farm were purchased in 1906 at public auction for $3,600 by Richard Lloyd Jones, an editor for Collier’s Weekly. On April 18, 1906 the Lincoln Farm Association was incorporated. The twenty eight members of the Board of Trustees agreed to raise money by voluntary subscription for the purpose of honoring and perpetuating the memory of Abraham Lincoln by erecting a Memorial Building to house and preserve the log cabin where he was born.\n\nThe Memorial Building\n\nThe Lincoln Farm Association envisioned a two-story museum with an avenue of trees leading to the entrance, and selected architect John Russell Pope to design the Memorial Building which was to house Lincoln’s birthplace cabin. A central court and a copy of the August Saint-Gaudens’ famous Lincoln statue were proposed. Funds fell short of the anticipated goals however, and Pope’s plans for the birthplace cabin to be placed in a central court with a movable roof were simplified. The building was made smaller and completely enclosed the cabin.\n\nGranite was supplied from Milford, Massachusetts for the building’s exterior. The interior marble was quarried in Tennessee. A wide formal stair of fifty-six steps, one for each year of Lincoln’s life, offers a dramatic approach. Beyond the one-story Doric portico are two bronzed-panel doors with matching double doors at the rear entrance.\n\nAuthenticity of the Lincoln cabin\n\nThe authenticity of the cabin was often questioned, but it was not until scholar Roy Hays published an article titled, “Is the Lincoln Birthplace Cabin Authentic?” in The Abraham Lincoln Quarterly in 1949 that scholarly research began. When a dendrochronologist removed core samples in 2004, absolute proof was obtained. The sampling determined that the oldest log in the cabin dates to 1848, indicating that the cabin enshrined in the Memorial Building was constructed later than 1848 and could not be the original birthplace cabin. Although not the original cabin, it is nonetheless significant for its role in perpetuating the image of Lincoln’s dramatic rise from poverty to the White House. Today, in light of the respectful manner the Lincoln Farm Association and the government treated the cabin, today it is referred to as the symbolic cabin; a symbol of the conditions and times of Lincoln’s birth and early childhood in rural Kentucky.\n\nNational Park Status\n\nIn 1911, the Lincoln Farm Association, their task completed, turned the park over to the State of Kentucky. In 1916, the Sinking Spring Farm became federal property. The park was managed by The War Department until jurisdiction over the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace was transferred the Department of the Interior and entrusted to the care of the National Park Service in August 1933.\n\nAbraham Lincoln Boyhood Home: Knob Creek Farm\n\nDuring a conversation in the White House, President Lincoln once remarked, “I remember the old home very well. Our farm was composed of three fields, which lay in a valley surrounded by high hills and deep gorges.”\n\nThe Lincolns moved to Knob Creek in 1811. Their one room log cabin at Knob Creek was near the Bardstown and Green River Turnpike. It was common for people traveling along the turnpike to spend the night at the Lincolns, and young Abraham would probably listen attentively to their stories of the world beyond Knob Creek. He might have seen merchants taking their goods to market, soldiers coming home from the War of 1812, and slaves being taken South to the auctions. Today, we know the Bardstown and Green River Turnpike as 31E.\n\nAbraham may have played with John and Isaac Hodgen. Their father, Robert Hodgen, owned the mill where people would take their corn to be ground. Each year, the neighbors would gather at the Hodgens’ for a feast. Because Robert Hodgen was such a strong supporter of the community, when it came time to name the town, they named it Hodgenville out of appreciation for his civic contributions.\n\nWhile living at Knob Creek, the children were sent to the A.B.C. School, taught by Zachariah Riney and Caleb Hazel. Some people called these “blab schools” because the students did their lessons out loud. Abraham Lincoln later stated that his formal education was less than one year.\n\nLegends say that while living at Knob Creek, young Abraham Lincoln found a dog with a broken leg. He made a splint and took care of the dog, naming it “Honey.” According to his childhood friend Austin Gollaher, Abraham also had a pet crow, adopted a raccoon, and was given a goat named, “Billy.”\n\nMisfortune seems to have followed the Lincolns from the Sinking Spring Farm, however, for on December 27, 1815, they were served with an eviction notice from the Knob Creek Farm. Thomas Lincoln and his neighbors countered with their own legal action. Now Thomas Lincoln was involved in two lawsuits: the Sinking Spring Farm he had bought and the Knob Creek Farm he was currently leasing! On September 12, 1816 the Hardin Circuit Court ruled against Thomas Lincoln, and he lost his claim to the Sinking Spring Farm. When he was served with an eviction notice to leave the Knob Creek Farm, Thomas decided to move his family to Indiana.\n\nThomas Lincoln moved his family to Perry (now Spencer) County, Indiana in December 1816. Thomas Lincoln’s brother, Josiah, had already moved to Harrison County, Indiana. Thomas Lincoln and his family were living in Indiana when the suit against the Knob Creek families was settled in their favor. Eventually the $200 dollars Thomas and Nancy paid for the Sinking Spring Farm was returned.\n\nKnob Creek Farm becomes a unit of the National Park Service\n\nIn 1928, the Howard family purchased the Kentucky boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln and dedicated themselves to preserving the memory of Lincoln’s time spent on this farm. Possession and management of this property remained in the family until November 2001, when the Howard family sold the site to the Preservation of Lincoln’s Kentucky Heritage, who donated it to the National Park Service, to be administrated by the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site. Today, visitors can walk the same fields the Lincolns plowed, view a historic garden and follow a hiking trail to an overlook of the Knob Creek valley."
