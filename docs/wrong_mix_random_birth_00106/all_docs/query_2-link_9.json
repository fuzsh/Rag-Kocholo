        "text": "Throughout his life, Abraham Lincoln maintained strong ties with Kentucky, especially in his personal and professional relationships. The major issues that surrounded him during his lifetime, divided this country into a bloody Civil War, and shaped the nation during Reconstruction, are very much a part of the Kentucky story. Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, was also born and raised in the Bluegrass State and her home is open in Lexington."
