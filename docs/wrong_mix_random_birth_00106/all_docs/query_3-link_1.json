        "text": "Explore the places, and the people who influenced and helped shape Lincoln in his early years.\n\nBorn in a one-room log cabin on his father's Sinking Spring Farm on Sunday, February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln's early years on the Kentucky frontier helped to shape his character and prepare the boy who would grow up to become the 16th President of the United States to lead the nation through the tragic and turbulent times of the Civil War. His legacy of liberty and equality remains relevant today and continues to impact people around the world."
