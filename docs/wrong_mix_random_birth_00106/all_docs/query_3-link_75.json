        "text": "205 years ago today, one of the most beloved U.S. Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, was born in his now famous log cabin.\n\nLincoln was a self-taught Illinois lawyer with a reputation opposing slavery. Many were shocked when Lincoln overcame several contenders to win the Republican Party’s nomination and eventually become the 16th President of the United States.\n\nIn 1863 Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which declared, “that all persons held as slaves are, and henceforward shall be free.”\n\nOn April 15, 1875 Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. While his life was cut short, his legacy has lived on.\n\nTo mark his birthday, politicians took to Twitter to honor the 16th President."
