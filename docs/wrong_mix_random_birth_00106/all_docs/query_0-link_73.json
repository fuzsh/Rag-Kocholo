        "text": "On April 15, 1861, three days after the attack on Ft. Sumter by the Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation seeking 75,000 volunteers to join the Union Army.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts, Irishman Thomas Cass immediately began recruiting Irish immigrants to form the Massachusetts 9th regiment. The volunteers came largely from Boston and the nearby towns of Salem, Milford, Marlboro and Stoughton. A total of 1,727 men enlisted.\n\nThe Irish volunteers encamped on Long Island in Boston Harbor through May, and on June 11 the Regiment was mustered into service.\n\nThe 9th enjoyed a big send-off on June 25, 1861, when the troops made their way from Long Island to Long Wharf in Boston, then marched to Boston Common, where Governor John Andrew welcomed them and thanked the two commanders, Colonel Cass and Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Guiney.\n\nGovernor Andrew presented them with flags of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the regiment was also permitted to carry its own Irish flag, which was donated by Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis. The flag is now part of the Hall of Flags at the Massachusetts State House.\n\nThe regiment fought bravely at many battlefronts during the Civil War, including Malvern Hill and Gettysburg. The regiment returned to Boston on June 13, 1864 and was mustered out on June 21, 1864.\n\nExcerpts from Irish Boston: A Lively Look at Boston's Colorful Irish Past.\n\nFor year round information on Boston Irish history and heritage, visit IrishHeritageTrail.com\n\nFor year round details on Irish cultural events, visit IrishBoston.org.\n\nShaquille O'Neill played for the Celtics in the 2010/11 season (This story was updated in March 2024) Many people wonder why the Boston Celtics wear shamrocks on their green uniforms and have a giant leprechaun smoking a cigar as their team logo. And why is the team mascot a guy named Lucky who looks like he stepped out of a box of Lucky Charms? According to the Boston Celtic’s official web site, the name came about in 1946 when owner Walter Brown started the team. He and his public relations guy, Howie McHugh, were throwing out potential nicknames, including the Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics. It was Brown who had the epiphany, saying, “Wait, I’ve got it – the Celtics. The name has a great basketball tradition from the old Original Celtics in New York (1920s). And Boston is full of Irishman. We’ll put them in green uniforms and call them the Boston Celtics.” Red Auerbach , the now legendary coach of the early Celtics, then commissioned his brother Zang, a graphic des\n\n(Originally published in 2013, this post was updated in 2021) Here are the Mayors of Boston Claiming Irish Heritage: Hugh O’Brien 1885–88 Patrick Collins 1902–05 John F.
