        "text": "Abraham Lincoln is coming to the Emmetsburg Public Library! On February 17th at 6 p.m., the library will be hosting Danny Russell, an actor and experienced Lincoln impersonator. Abraham Lincoln is arguably one of the most influential presidents in United States history. He will come alive during this special performance in honor of his birthday.\n\nDanny Russell has been in the acting business for more than 30 years. He has committed his life to teaching viewers about important figures in Indiana history. He started his career as Lincoln with months of research and visits to Lincoln’s birthplace, childhood home, Gettysburg, PA, and Washington, D.C. Since he is portraying such an important historical figure, his show actually had to be vetted by the Indiana Arts Commission for accuracy. Once approved, Russell was able to take his show on the road.\n\nRussell performs in Lincoln’s customary black suit and stovepipe hat as he explores the life, hilarity, heartbreak, and humanity of Abraham Lincoln. This performance is for adults and kids alike. Runtime is about an hour with time for questions at the end of the show.\n\n“As you relive Lincoln’s legacy, it’s a real highlight because of [his] expertise! Abe couldn’t be portrayed better,” commented Eric Holcomb, Governor of Indiana."
