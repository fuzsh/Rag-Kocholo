The other sites fall into different National Park System categories like Battlefields, Historic Sites, Monuments, Seashores, Recreation Areas, and others.\n\nWe are trying to visit all of them, or at least as many as we can as we travel around these wonderful states of ours.\n\nAnd we hit another one yesterday…\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a small cabin in Hodgenville, Kentucky. His early life in Kentucky was a humble start for the 16th President of the United States."
