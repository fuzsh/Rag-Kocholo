        "text": "Hingham, Massachusetts, is distinguished as the home of all the first settlers of the name of Lincoln, and from these Hingham pioneers all the families of Lincoln with a colonial history are descended. Abraham Lincoln traced his ancestry to one of the Hingham pioneers, and likewise Governor Lincoln, of Massachusetts, and the Lincolns of Worcester and Boston. The name Lincoln, with its variants (Linkhorn, Linkoln, Lincon) were common in Hingham, England, for more than a century before the emigrants from that town founded Hingham, Mass., where there were eight of the name of Lincoln among the early settlers. The family came from Wymondham, county Norfolk, England.\n\nThere were three brothers - Daniel, Thomas and Samuel - who came in the party, accompanied by their mother Joan. There were in the remarkable Lincoln colony of Hingham no less than four of the name of Thomas Lincoln, distinguised from one another by their trades. Thomas Lincoln, miller, removed to Taunton; Thomas Lincoln, cooper, and Thomas Lincoln, husbandman, resided in Hingham. Wymondham or Windham was probably the birthplace of Stephen and Thomas Lincoln, but they were closely connected with others of the name who came from Hingham, England, to Hingham, Mass.\n\n(I) Samuel Lincoln, brother of Daniel and Thomas Lincoln, appears of record as being eighteen years old at the time of his sailing from Hingham, England, in 1637. He resided but a short time at Salem and settled before the close of that year in Higham, Mass. He is designatied in early records as a weaver and also mariner, and died May 26, 1690, in Hingham. He inherited considerable property from his brother Daniel in 1644, and from Thomas in 1675. In 1649 he purchased property on what is now (1910) North street, Hingham, near the present railroad station, consisting of five acres, which is still held by his descendants.\n\nHis wife Martha died in Hingham, April 10, 1694.\n\nChildren:\n\nSamuel, Daniel, Mordecai (died young), Mordecai (mentioned below), Thomas (died young), Mary, Thomas, Martha, Sarah (died young), Sarah and Rebecca.\n\n(II) Mordecai, fourth son of Sameula dn Martha Lincoln, was born June 14, 1657, in Hingham, where he died Nov. 8, 1727. He was a blacksmith by trade, and owned and operated iron works and grist and saw mills, and was also an extensive owner of lands in Hingham and Scituate. His will made liberal provision for his children, and also provided for a college education for three of his grandchildren if they should desire to pursue the same. He resided in the second precinct of Hingham a part or the time, and in Scituate, near the Hingham line.\n\nHe married (first) Sarah, daughter of Abraham and Sarah (Whitman) Jones of Hull; (second) a widow, Mary Gannett, probably of Scituate, born 1665-66, died in Hingham, April 19, 1745. There were five children of the first wife,k and one of the second -:\n\nMordecai, Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, Elizabeth and Jacob.\n\nThe first of these, born April 24, 1686, removed to Monmouth county, New Jersey, and later to Pennsylvania; he bequeathed to his son John three hundred acres of land in New Jersey.\n\nThe latter settled in Augusta county, Virginia, and his son Abraham resided first in North Carolina, and removed about 1782 to Kentucky. Thomas, son of the last named, was the father of the martyr president, Abraham Lincoln.\n\n(III) Isaac, third son of Mordecai and Sarah (Jones) Lincoln, was born Oct. 24, 1691, in Hingham, and died Jan. 15, 1771. He was a mariner, and resided for a time in Scituate, but passed most of his life in the second precinct of Hingham, in a house which his father built in 1717 and bequeathed to him in 1727.\n\nHe married (second) Mrs. Jael Wade, daughter of Joseph and Ruth (Buck) Garret of Scituate; she died after July 17, 1770, the date of her will.\n\nChildren of first wife:\n\nIsaac and Mordecai.\n\n(IV) Isaac (2), eldest son of Isaac (1) and Sarah (Cummings) Lincoln, was born Aug. 5, 1717, in Hingham, and was a farmer residing in the second precinct of Hingham, in a house which he built about 1740, north of his father's residence.\n\nHe married (first) Dec. 24, 1741, Ruth, daughter of Lazarus and Ruth (Andrews) Beal, born March 10, 1722, in Hingham, died March 6, 1763; (second) Oct. 7, 1764, Sarah, widow of Francis Lincoln, and daughter of Rev. Nehemiah and Lydia (Jacobs) Hobart, born July 2, 1727, in Hingham, died Oct. 11, 1815.\n\nThere were eleven children of the first wife and two of the second:\n\nIsaac, Cummings (died young), Uriah, James (died young), Sarah, James (died young), Ruth, Abigail, Lazarus (mentioned below), Mercy, James, Chloe and Cummings.\n\n(V) Lazarus, sixth son of Isaac (2) and Ruth (Beal) Lincoln, was born Oct. 3, 1756, in Hingham, and resided on South Main street near his father.
