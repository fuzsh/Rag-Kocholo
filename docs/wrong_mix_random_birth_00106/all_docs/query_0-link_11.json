        "text": "Complete information about visiting Boston National Historical Park is now on National Park Planner!\n\nBoston National Historical Park is largely a collection of American Revolution-related historical sites located in downtown Boston, all of which can be reached by walking the Freedom Trail, an organized route that leads to all points of interest. The trail has its southern terminus at Boston Common and its northern terminus at Bunker Hill. The neat thing about the trail is that it is actually marked in the sidewalk with a pattern of colored bricks, so as long as you can find your way to a point on the trail, you don’t even need a map—just follow the Yellow Brick Road, so to speak.\n\nThere are twenty-one different stops on the Freedom Trail (depending on how you count them). There are historic buildings, churches, cemeteries, sites of historic events, and markers for buildings that no longer exist. Some sites offer tours, some offer exhibits and museums, and some you simply enter, take a look around, and leave.\n\nPARK AT A GLANCE\n\nPARK MAP\n\nVISITOR CENTERS\n\nFREEDOM TRAIL\n\nCEMETERIES\n\nCHURCHES\n\nHISTORIC SITES\n\nMUSEUMS\n\nDIRECTIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION"
