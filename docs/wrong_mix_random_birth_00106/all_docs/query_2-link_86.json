He was 56 years old.\n\nLincoln, along with his wife and three of their four sons, is buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois. Details: bit.ly/3YysL8E\n\nStates that list Lincoln’s birth date as a state holiday include Connecticut, Illinois and Missouri.\n\nLincoln’s birthday has never been a federal holiday. Historically, there have been attempts to persuade Congress, but politics prevailed.\n\nHe is often named within the top three spots in over-the-years rankings of best United States presidents by historians and political scientists. His leadership during the Civil War 1861-65 earns him the acclaim.\n\nLincoln’s favorite dessert has been reported to be White Almond Cake with confectioner’s sugar, as baked by his wife Mary Todd Lincoln. Here’s a recipe from the National Park Service referencing the information and the recipe found in “Lincoln’s Table: A Presidential Culinary Journey from Cabin to Cosmopolitan” by Donna D.
