        "text": "Lincoln’s First Inaugural Address. Noted for his concluding words: \"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"\n\nPreviously he rejects the notion that states may secede, and notes his oath to defend the Constitution, including the right of slave-owners to reclaim fugitive slaves. And, \"Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible, so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\"\n\nIn a Special Session Message, Lincoln reviews the events since his Inauguration and his decision to “call out the war power of the Government.” He calls for raising an army of at least 400,000. Argues forcefully against the idea that States have a right to withdraw from the Union.\n\nSigns an act (12 Stat 326) that approves Lincoln’s emergency use of army and navy and militia. These orders are “in all respects legalized and made valid. . . as if they had been issued and done under the previous express authority and direction of the Congress of the United States.”\n\nSigns “Act for the Release of certain Persons held to Service of Labor in the District of Columbia,” (12 Stat 376) freeing slaves in the District and compensating their owners up to $300 provided the owner swears an oath of allegiance to the Government of the United States. Appropriates $1 Million for the program and $100,000 to “aid in the colonization and settlement of such free persons of African descent now residing in said District.”\n\nSigns \"An Act to grant Pensions\" (12 Stat 566) that increased pension rates and provided pensions to anyone in military service since 03/04/1861. Also benefitting were their widows and orphans (if death due to military service), or a dependent mother or sister. These pensions eventually become the largest single expenditure of the government (other than interest on the debt).\n\nSigns Second Confiscation Act (12 Stat 589) declaring that slaves owned by anyone participating in rebellion will be made free; seeks to seize property of Confederate leaders; specifies that escaped slaves are to be set free; allows the President to “employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion.”\n\nLetter to Horace Greeley published in New York Times, August 24; “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.”\n\nMessage to the Senate Responding to the Resolution Regarding Indian Barbarities in the State of Minnesota. Reports that he commuted the death sentences of all convicted in the “Dakota Wars” except for those proven to have participated in massacres as opposed to battles. [Link to Senate Document with attachments.]\n\nInterview with John T. Mills. “Abandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men, take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our side and put them in the battle-field or corn-field against us, and we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.”\n\nSecond Inaugural Address. “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”\n\nAddress to an Indiana Regiment. “While I have often said that all men ought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to be slaves who want to be, and next to them those white people who argue in favor of making other people slaves.”"
