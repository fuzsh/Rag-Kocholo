        "text": "Trivia time: How many national parks are dedicated to the childhood, life, presidency, and death of President Abraham Lincoln? Among all of the former Presidents of the United States, Lincoln is one of the best commemorated in the National Park Service. To date, there are at 12 national parks honoring President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nFebruary marks one of the best months to tour Lincoln-related parks. Lincoln’s Birthday was February 12th.

It also marks the beginning of Lincoln’s formal legislative efforts to end slavery in the United States.\n\nFort Stevens & Civil War Defenses of Washington, Washington D.C.\n\nWhile technically only an affiliated designation and not one of the 400+ units of the National Park Service, Civil War Defenses of Washington should be on any list of historical places related to President Lincoln. During the heart of the Civil War, Washington DC became a heavily fortified city with a collection of forts, batteries, and military outposts all designed to prevent a Confederate attack on the city.\n\nAmong the 17 different sites managed in partnership with the NPS, is Fort Stevens where a plaque commemorates where President Lincoln came under enemy fire.\n\nFord’s Theatre National Historic Site, Washington, DC\n\nOn April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford’s Theatre in Washington D.C.

During the spring and summer months, attend a One Destiny event, a costumed performance with key historical figures who were present the night of the assassination.\n\nGettysburg National Military Park, Pennsylvania\n\nA list of national parks honoring President Abraham Lincoln would not be complete without Gettysburg National Military Park.

Today, Gettysburg is one of the most popular Civil War-era tourist attractions in the United States. Each year thousands of visitors attend battlefield tours and living history reenactments here.\n\nLincoln Memorial, National Mall and Memorial Parks, Washington, DC\n\nPerhaps the most famous Lincoln-related site (and one of the most famous landmarks in the entire United States) is the Lincoln Memorial. Part of National Mall and Memorial Parks, the Lincoln Memorial does count as a stand-alone unit of the 400+ parks on the official #parkchasing list.\n\nThere’s so much to see at the Lincoln Memorial. Read some of Lincoln’s most famous words. Look out on the rest of Washington D.C. Stand in the spot where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech. recommend you visit the Lincoln Memorial multiple times on your trip. It’s a captivating sight both during the day and at night.\n\nLincoln Boyhood National Memorial, Indiana\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how Lincoln grew into such a historic leader, look no further than Lincoln City, Indiana. Home to the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, it’s here that Abraham Lincoln grew from a 7-year-old boy into a 21-year-old young man. It’s also where he developed the traits that would later lead him to the presidency, and the courage to lead his country out of the Civil War.\n\nVisitors to Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial have many options to learn about the President’s childhood. Tour a historic replica of the Lincoln Farm. Visit the Cabin Memorial Site and see a bronze casting of where the cabin once stood. Or hike on one of the park’s miles of walking trails where Lincoln played and roamed as a child.\n\nLincoln Home National Historic Site, Illinois\n\nBetween the time Lincoln left home and became President, he and his wife Mary Todd lived in Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln Home National Historic Site preserves the only home Lincoln ever owned, just blocks from the Illinois State Capitol building.

After that, walk the four-block area around the home and see some of the other buildings that were a part of Lincoln’s life during the years he lived in Springfield.\n\nMount Rushmore National Memorial, South Dakota\n\nOne of the most popular road trip destinations in the Midwest also finds its way onto this list of national parks honoring President Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota has one of the most familiar images of Lincoln in the entire world. Visitors to the site can learn why the sculptor Gutzon Borglum memorialized Lincoln.\n\nFun fact: Lincoln’s face is more than 60 feet tall and his nose on Mount Rushmore extends more than 20 feet long!\n\nRelated Links:\n\nThe Night Program at Mount Rushmore\n\n19 Amazing National Parks for Independence Day\n\nVisit all the National Park Service Sites in South Dakota\n\n13 National Parks Honoring George Washington\n\nPetersburg National Battlefield, Virginia\n\nJust a week before his assassination, President Lincoln visited General Ulysses S. Grant at City Point, his headquarters during the later Civil War. City Point is now part of present-day Petersburg National Battlefield. The Siege of Petersburg also occurred here, when more than 70,000 soldiers died during nine months of fighting. Today visitors can take guided tours of the battlefield, see General Grant’s Headquarters, or hike along some of the park’s 18 miles of nature trails.\n\nRichmond National Battlefield Park, Virginia\n\nLocated just 25 miles north of Petersburg National Battlefield is another historic Civil War site honoring Lincoln.

Lincoln visited Richmond just days before his assassination in 1865.\n\nA life-sized sculpture remains in the park of Lincoln and his son Tad commemorating their historic visit after the Confederate surrender.\n\nYosemite National Park, CA\n\nYosemite? You’re wondering, ‘how does Yosemite make it on the list of national parks honoring President Abraham Lincoln?’\n\nIn some ways, all of the national parks could be on this list. It was President Lincoln’s legacy that established them. On June 30, 1864, Lincoln signed the Yosemite Land Grant. It was the world’s first legislation to establish and preserve land for public enjoyment. The bill set aside Yosemite “for public use, resort and recreation.” It also established the groundwork to later create Yellowstone National Park in 1872 and Yosemite National Park in 1890.\n\nRelated Links:\n\n14 National Parks with Big Trees\n\nWhich National Parks Are Like Yellowstone?\n\nThe Most Visited National Parks\n\nThe Best Canyon Hikes in the National Park Service\n\n17 National Parks with Stunning Waterfalls"
