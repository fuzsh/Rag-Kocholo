        "text": "This coming Monday is Lincoln’s Birthday, a holiday that is observed on the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth. The 12th president of the United States was born on February 12, 1809 in Hodgenville, Kentucky.\n\nThe holiday is a legal public holiday in multiple states and is observed in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Texas. It is an official state holiday in four of those states, namely California, Connecticut, Illinois, and Missouri.\n\nIn most other states, Lincoln’s birthday is not celebrated separately but is observed jointly with the anniversary of the birth of George Washington on Presidents’ Day, which falls on the third Monday in February, which this year is on February 19.\n\nLincoln’s Birthday is marked by wreath-laying ceremonies at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville and at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. A wreath is laid on behalf of the president of the United States at Lincoln’s tomb in Springfield, Illinois, a custom that is carried out at the graves of all deceased U.S. presidents on their respective birthdays.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated with sales at department stores and large retailers and is a day off from school in some parts of the country. Indiana recognizes and celebrates Lincoln’s Birthday as a holiday on the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in November.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about what’s open for business and operating in the United States – and what isn’t – on Monday.\n\nGOVERNMENT OFFICES All Federal government offices are open on Monday, as will be almost all city and state offices.\n\nPOST OFFICE Regular mail service is in effect.\n\nBANKS Financial institutions have the option to close. Many in states where it is an official holiday will, in fact, be closed.\n\nSCHOOLS Closed on Monday for in-person and remote instruction in states where it is an official holiday. Some colleges and universities may also be closed.\n\nFINANCIAL MARKETS The nation’s stock and bond markets will be open on Monday.\n\nTRANSPORTATION Most local transportation systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter rail systems, will operate on a normal schedule. Airports and train stations will be open.\n\n(Photo: Accura Media Group)"
