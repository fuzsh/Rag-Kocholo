        "text": "Poker Boy has saved the world a number of times, but never from an alien. With the help of his sidekick, Front Desk Girl and Leverne, Lady Luck herself, Poker Boy must do battle with an alien snake across the only battlefield Poker Boy knows: a poker table.\n\nThe stakes are higher than in the original Garden of Eden. To make matters worse, Poker Boy hates snakes.\n\nGambling universe superhero Poker Boys loves saving dogs, even though that’s not part of his duty in the gambling universe. He sometimes thinks he saves more dogs than he does people.\n\nNow he and his team must use every skill they have to save not just one dog, but all dogs from a force that can’t be stopped. Or can it?\n\nPoker Boy somehow finds himself facing an imitation of his girlfriend, Patty Ledgerwood. Within a fraction of a second he somehow saves himself and maybe the world from another war.\n\nOr maybe he helps set up a new war.\n\nWhat’s a girl to do when Daddy wants her dead? Especially when Daddy is Mortuary Dan, otherwise known as Death himself.\n\nPoker Boy and his team must help the only daughter of Death understand that she’s really not going to die as she turns twenty-one.\n\nEven though she is.\n\nSort of….\n\nWhen the wife of one the guardians of humanity, herself one of the most powerful beings in the universe, comes looking for help, a superhero does what he can. Poker Boy and his sidekick (and girlfriend), Front Desk Girl, must help with no idea why."
