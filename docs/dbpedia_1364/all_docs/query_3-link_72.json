Fake, Rutherford, N.J. December, IS43. INTRODUCTION 1 624970 In considering the subject of family names it should be noted that if it is blood that counts there is no particular point in looking back through one’s paternal line to the exclusion of the maternal. The mere family name carries no very great weight in this connection; Blackstone in dealing with consanguinity tells us that at seven generations we each have one hundred twenty-eight ancestors whose blood courses in our veins, at ten genera¬ tions one thousand and twenty-four and at twenty upwards of one million. Surely one’s lifetime is all too short to consider any appreciable number of them. What follows is directed to th e descendants of John George Fake (Feick) of Pittstown, Rensselaer County, New York. Few young people evidence any serious interest in their genealogy and I am sure I would have fallen into the same class when in my teens, were it not that I was forced to take an early interest by reason of hard knocks. In my boyhood the word “fake” had then but recently come into use as a slang word. It had not reached the dignity of dictionary definition, but I soon found that in my case it carried a challenge to fight and it seemed to my immature mind wholly inadequate to fellow the thought th3t “sticks 1 . .... m •• ! J and stones would break my bones but names would never hurt me.” The name did hurt me, at least to the extent that my thoughts soon led me to make inquiries of my father and grandfather as to why we were burdened with such a family name and then later when the proper noun Guy, also fell into the category of the unbeautiful, my cup of anguish and combativeness was full to overflowing. So, the beginning of my interest in our name was not born of the usual vanity but rather it commenced as a defense mechanism from which it soon evolved into a spirit of interested investigation prompting sporadic attempts to learn more and more concerning the families aid activities of the Fakes who had gone before and as well of those now living. If all the amusing incidents which have befallen us who bear the name Fake were gathered together they would fill a volume. My father in his travels was once intro¬ duced to a Mr. Mud as follows: “Mud meet Fake, Fake meet Mud, Fake don’t get stuck by Mud and Mud dpn’t get stuck by . / Fake”. On meeting my father, Mr. Holstein inquired if my father was a fake whereupon father desired to know if Mr. Holstein was a cow. In shopping at the city stores our ladies are often called on to spell the n ame F-A-h-E and sometimes the foroe of it is so shocking to saleswomen that 2 - ■ ' they ask in utter amazement if that is really and truly the name. On more than one occasion metropolitan papers have carried squibs calling attention to the fact that there really are people by the name of Fake and strange as it would seem they are not crooks. That reminds me of a , highly respected citizen and lawyer of Brooklyn, New York, who bore the name Able Crook. On learning of my existence, Guy Fake, he is reported to have said: “Now I can die in peace for I have at last found a lawyer with a name worse than my own , In my late teens I enlisted in the Army for the Spanish=Amcrican War. The Colonel of my Regiment ran on my name in th e roster and asked how it came that he had a man in his regiment with “such a hell of a pair of ntmes On being assured by the regimental adjutant that I was a young man of reasonably good repute in my home town, he commanded my immediate presence for inspection as a curiosity of some moment. Having polished my boots, buttons and equip¬ ment until I glittered, I appeared at the Colonel’s tent, was directed into his presence, salpted, and was ordered to be at ease. Whereupon he scrutinized me closely and desired to know how I acquired my names. I informed him that I was born with one of them and the other had been thrust upon me by a Colonel of the Civil War period who wa^ toy grandfather. 3 * ■ but that he had eased off the injury at the time by pre¬ senting me with $500 by way of damages. At dress parade a few days later my name was read out for special duty as a mounted orderly to the acting Adjutant General. Years later the Colonel told me that the Adjutant General had been incredulous concerning my name and he sent me over to him to prove it in the flesh. Some years ago my father and my brother, Edward were traveling in the West and registered at a small town hotel. The next day the local paper announced: “Look out for yourselves two Fakes registered at the Grant House last night/ * In the year 1906 several of the good people in my county asserted that the Republican Party had reached an all time low when they chose an unknown young man named Fake to run for the State Legislature and during the campaign I was generally introduced as a “Fake by name but not by nature”. How I got over the hurdles of that handicap I don’t know to this day. However, there is some consolation in the name. Iwy father who was the s oul of honor used to tell us that we had an opportunity which was afforded to very few boys. That if we would lead upright and honorable lives we had it in our power to change the meaning of the word fake. 4 - Seriously, after an experience of sixty odd years with the name I rather glory in it and can truthfully say that a \"rose by any other name will smell as sweet\", moreover it’s been lots of fun. In the following pages it is the design to set up the limited data that has b een obtained over the years relating to each family which was headed by one of the male descendants of Johann goerg feick and such addi¬ tional information as I have from divers sources concern¬ ing the female lines making no pretense whatever as to the completeness of the record. Long prior to the Revolution, in fact, in the Palatine migrations of 1709-12, there were several families by the name of Feek, Faeg, Feck, Feick, etc., who came to West Camp and later into Schoharie County, New ^ork. The spelling of the German names by the scriveners of that period was not a fine art and the names are often far different from those their descendants now bear. Many of the men saw service as soldiers or officers in the early Border Wars and later in the Continental Army, some of the records of their services appear in a book entitled \"Military Records of Schoharie County Veterans of Four Wars by George H. Warner, 1891. I have not been able to establish any relationship between these families and our \"Johann goerg feick” of Pittstown. However, there is a single reference ' coming very close to a connection as will appear in one of the christening records to be considered later. There are several families now resident in the United States by the name of Fake and Fakes, who are positively not descended from our Ancestor and who, like ourselves come by the name through faulty spelling. For example, there is a large and distinguished family in Pennsylvania, most of whom reside in Lebanon and Lancaster Counties, (Pa.) They are descended from one Leonard Feeg, a New York Palatine emigrant who broke away from the first settlement at West Camp near Newburgh, New York at an early date and made his way into Schoharie County, New York and later down the Susquehanna River to Lancaster County, Pa. For some years past this family has been holding an annual reunion at Ephrata, Pennsylvania. On one occasion I attended and had the great pleasure of meeting Dr. Fake of Ephrata and Ivir. Earl Fake, the school principal of Reading, Pennsylvania and many others, some of these folks still speak the German known as Pennsylvania Dutch. One of the best sellers for the year 1942 was a novel by Elsie Singmaster entitled, “A High Wind Rising”, which tells of the migration of the “Fegs” and others from Schoharie down into Pennsylvania. 6 . ' Back in 1912 there was a family residing at Ashville, North Carolina who spell their name “Fakes” and I received a letter in February of that year from Dr. B, R. Fakes of Slayden Fakes & Co,, wholesale grocers which reads in part as follow's* “The writer & my Bro. at McCrory, Ark. are possibly the Drs. you refer to, as we are from Wilson Co,, Tenn. some 30 miles from Nashville. Our father W, C. Fakes came to this city from Ky. My grand- father Jno. F. was twice married & raised some 21 children. I have a Bro, Jno., who resides in Lebanon, Tenn., Wilson Co., one B ro. in Los Angeles, Calif. Only 4 of the Eight Bros, of my family are living. I W'as at one time connected with my Uncle Jno. M. Fakes in the Corn business in New Orleans. Uncle sav; the name on a Bank Bill by the name of “Fake”, Pres, of a New York Bank. He had a correspondence with him & my recollection is that our ancestors came from the same place. This correspondence was some 40 years ago, so I do not recall, only that the conclusion was that the families were the same & that we had added the “s” or their side had droped it. I graduated in Medicine directly after our Civil War between the States but soon gave it up for a mercantile life which I am still 7 ' ■' tfc In. Have lived here 20 years. On the 13th inst. I will be 74. ” This family of “Fakes” is not connected with the line of our ancestor as far as I have been able to ascertain. The Banker above referred to was Col. John S. Fake of Lansingburgh, New York of our line. I have a note of a family residing at Fulton, Kentucky in 1912 named “Fakes” descended from a John “Fakes” of North Carolina, who was of Scotch descent. They trace back in America to 1808. Here again we find no connec¬ tion. In 1903 I received a letter from a Mr. George F?ke, a jeweler of #1113 Broadway, which f reads in part as follows: “Your interesting letter received some few days ago. Up till a short time ago, when I saw a piece of news copied from a Chicago paper, telling of a lawyer by the name of Fake, who had performed some kindly act to a poor family, I had thought our's the only Fake family in existence. It is a good sized family of eleven children, myself being the oldest, lvly Father's name, was William Seeker Fake, his Father was named John Camel, and his Father was James, we think, who was bom near 8 Feltwell, in Norfolk, England, but worked as a wheelwright in Bury St., Edmunds about 1790. }}e later joined a local militia Co. as Sergeant, serv¬ ing some years. As far as we know my Father's brother George J. Fake was the first of the family to come to this country, arriving in San Francisco, about 1850,\" This family of course tracing its line back in England is not connected with our line. V/hen I was in London in 1S24 I found several men by the name of Fake listed in the telephone book. There is a Fort on Mindenoa Lake in Mindenoa, Philippine Islands named Fort Fake. Just why the Fort is so named I do not know. These references are given here for what they may be worth to anyone who may desire to under¬ take further researches. We are all greatly indebted to Mr. Abram J. Fake of the New York Bar for his intensive and careful labors in obtaining and compiling by far the larger number of the names and dates appearing herein. My own research has been directed almost entirely to our first ancestor and a few direct male lines. S GUY L# FAKE 1 I i ■ Johan goerg feick Anglicized John George Fake There has been a tradition in the family that our first paternal ancestor to come to America was a young man sixteen to eighteen years of age, who sailed from Holland and that he settled at Brunswick in the Town of Pittstown then in Albany County, New York, early in the Eighteenth Century where he pursued the double calling of farmer and blacksmith. That this tradition is founded on truth is amply borne out by such facts as I have succeeded in gathering. For some years I have endeavored to ascer¬ tain and fix the date and town of his birth but have been unable to do so with a satisfying degree of certainty. I will present here however what I have ascertained down to the present time in this connection, in the hope that some one may answer these two questions with greater certainty in the light of future research. There is no difficulty whatever in establishing the date of his death which occurred on October 31, 1821, as will be seen in the records that follow! 10 • ■ The late 3ishop, William E. McLaren of the Chicago Diocese married into the Fake family. His wife was one Mary Fake, a great granddaughter of the original settler. She had given some attention to family records. Born in 1838 she was able to obtain information from others then living who have now long since passed on. Her brother, Edward was born in 1842 and died in 187S and he also had been interested in the subject. The Bishop was the President of my college Fraternity, Phi Gamma D elta, and in 1804, he wrote me as follows, referring to his wife and her forebears: “Nicholas % Fake was her grandfather, son of George Fake” (meaning John George v/ho seems sometimes to have been referred to as George or George, Sr., dropping the first name) “who emigrated from Holland in 1733, sixteen to eighteen years of age and died in Pittstown, New York near Troy October 31, 1821.” From these figures it would appear that George Fake died at the great age of one hundred four or one hundred six years. In 1806, the Bishop having passed on, I obtained further data from his son William A. McLaren, copied apparently by an emanuensis and in longhand in which the foregoing dates are repeated and then this: “He was a farmer born 1715”, from which it would appear that our ancestor was one hundred and six years old when he died. In 1911 being incredulous and still trying to get more satisfying information, I wrote to Miss Helen McLaxen, a . . ' .. i . ’ • ••. ; a » f i o j'jn f-U d' irir ni bnftf' 10I ni 'ns . . daughter of the Bishop and received a letter from her in which she says her mother's “information was obtained from her brother\" (her mother's brother, Edward) “but as he has been dead many years there is no way of ascertaining from what source he gathered it or how authentic it was,\" These figures have been copied and recopied without comparisons with the original data and inaccuracies have certainly crept in. Had an ancestor of ours reached either of the ages men¬ tioned, I am sure there would have been a tradition of it passing down in the family, but neither my father, my grand¬ father nor anyone else in our family ever mentioned it in my hearing. Moreover it would seem that something more than usual notice would have been given to the death of a man of such very great age and that stories of it would have passed down in the county where he died but no such traditional information has been brought to light. There wrere several early migrations of Palatine Germans from the Rhine Valley into the Hudson Valley in New York, starting in 1709-10 and running through several ensuing years. As has been noted there were families among them bear¬ ing names which would indicate that they may have been rela¬ tives of our ancestor. The history of these Palatines fur¬ nishes one of the most interesting pages in history. The better 12 to understand these upright God-fearing people it is well to read such historical novels as D rums Along the Mohawk, Smoke Fires in Schoharie, A High Wind Rising and Cooper’s Chainbearer, and more important than all, Honeyman’s Essay on the Palatines appearing in the New Jersey Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. 10, No. 3, which is more complete and authentic. STwas from the same section of Germany and from the same Lutheran Palatine stock that our first American ancestor came. Most of these settlers coming in between the years 1730 and 1775 came on vessels from Holland touching England on the way over and destined for Philadelphia. Im¬ mediately on arrival the passengers were taken to the- Court House in Philadelphia where they were called upon to qualify by taking an oath of allegiance to Great Britain and sign their respective names to the ship.’s list, thereby becoming at once subjects of the English Crown. Many, if not all, of the original records and signatures of those who thus ar¬ rived have been preserved to this day in the archives at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Many of them appear in “Rupp’s 30,000 names of Emigrants in Pennsylvania”. This migration in which our ancestor is found is accounted for by the de¬ vastating wars which had raged in the Rhine Valley in the years shortly preceding their arrival here. Reference to * the history of the cruelties they suffered following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, when hundreds of miles of the Rhine Valley were laid waste, and Protestants were massacred by the thousands, is all that is necessary to explain their desire to remove to a land where religious freedom and economic security might be found. Many letters had been sent back by the first German settlers and printed advertisements were also circulated in the Rhine districts, pointing out in glowing terms the ease with which land might be acquired here and praising the climate and the great fertility of the soil. The inducements to come over were glowing and more than sufficient to overcome any love they may have had for the home districts from whence they came. Being unable to find any trace of our ancestor in the meagre ship lists of arrivals at New York, I examined Rupp’s work and there ran upon two entries which attracted my attention, one of which I feel I am now able to prove with reasonable certainty, is the signature of our ancestor. The document on which his signature appears reads as follows: 14 “At the Court House at Philadelphia Saturday the 14th day of September 1751 Present The Worshipful The Mayor Joshua Maddon Esq. The Foreigners whose names are underwritten imported in the ship St. Andrew Captn James Abercrombie from Rotterdam but last from Cowes in England did this day take and subscribe the usual qualifications No. 100 230 Whole Freights „ 7 Roman Catholics Messrs. V/edman 1C Menonites Remndr Calvinists” Then appear the signatures of those who could write and the cross marks of those who could not. Among the signatures we find that of “Johann goerg feick”, our ancestor, a photostat of a part of the page on wrhich it ap¬ pears follows: 15 - /• •» .« v <)* p *• , ,) /.

This is set up here to show his signature as he v/rote it on landing so comparisons of the signature may be made with later ones which positively we know to be his. It will be noted in the following photostatic copies of the pages of his bible, that our ancestor has signed his name no less than seven times. He starts out with ‘'Johann goerg feick”. The i, is rather indistinct as an “i”, but there is a speck above the third letter which undoubtedly is a dot. The i’s and c-’s however are much alike. In the tenth line from the top of the page he writes his name “Johann goerg feck”. Examining the baptismal records in the bible it is seen that he signs four times as “Johann goerg feck” and once as “goerg feck”. Note the flourish in writing the k at the end of his name, and note the same on his signature on the ship list. Also note the lack of capital letters in writing his middle and last names in each instance. Cn a deed dated 1793 made by him to his son Nicholas and now in my possession, he signs as grantor, “Johann goerg feck”. The English speaking scrivener wrote his name in the body of the instrument as “George Fake”’, leaving out his first name and Anglicizing the last. In the certificate of acknowledgement it is written “Feak”. 17 His son George is a witness to the deed and he signs his name in a beautiful hand “George Fake Junr.” Thus we find our name, Fake, today, when undoubtedly it was correctly spelled, “Feick”, by our ancestor when he landed. This deed convinces me that he was generally known, not by his first name, but by his second name “George”. His powder horn is further evidence to this effect as is also the record of his service in the Revolution. It is interesting to digress at this point to note thfct on that September Saturday in 1751, when our ancestor first put foot on these shores at Philadelphia, he found himself in the largest settlement then in America, a community with a population of about thirteen or fourteen thousand people, many of whom were negro slaves. Today that city has a population of upwards of one million nine hundred thousand. In 1750 the entire population of the colonies was but one million three hundred seventy thousand, a fifth of whom we re slaves, while today the population is upwards of 130 million. The land to the westward beyond a distance of eighty or ninety miles back from the Atlantic seaboard stretched away to the Pacific Ocean, a primeval wilderness untouched by te hand of man. 18 Ge-erge Washington was at the time a young man nineteen years of age, about the same age as our ancestor, Thomas Jefferson was a boy of nine and Alexander Hamilton was not yet born. George II, a native of Germany w,s on the English throne speaking German and quite unable to understand English, Charles Theodore of the Sulzbach une was the Elector of the Palatinate from whence I believe our ancestor came. This section cf Germany b elonged at the time to the Rhenish circle and was bounded by Mainz, ltatzenell cnbogen, Wurtenberg, Baden, Alsace, ermine and Treves. It took in. the principality of Simmerq. the duchy of Zweibrucker. and half of the County of Sponheim, and also the principalities of Veldenz and Lautern. It was at Becherbach thtt our ancestor says in his bible he was given his name, which I interpret as being the place of his birth and baptism. Not until very recently was I able to locate any such place name in all of Germany and then fortunately or unfortunately, I found two. They are both very smali villages listed in a publication issued out of Switzerland for the use of the International cable companies entitled “Nomenclature Des Bureaux Telegraphiqucs . There we find , B.cb.rbocb Speyer IE*. Spire.) ““ ,E* Coblenz). I ton \"» «*» ““““ 19 cime from the Becherbach near Speyer. Research in the Lutheran Church baptismal records of these places may give the answer as to which of the two was the birthplace of our ancestor. Let us hope that our Army may soon blast hell out of whichever it is but save only the records in that old Lutheran Church or Dom where they may be found when the Nat^is are wiped out and the people of Germany are forced once and for all to function as civilized beings. Their history indicates however that it will take a cetitury or more to make an enlightened people of them. The best of their God-fearing, liberty-loving and sensible men and women left Germany long since to come over here and aid in the building of a free America as our ancestor did. The petty and unconscionable rulers of the Germany of 1751 were engaged in pressing young men into military service and selling them into the armies of foreign rulers to fight in wars in distant places involving issues concerning which they usually had no knowledge or compelling them to fight for the supremacy of dictators and tyrants for whom they had nothing but loathing and disgust. Three years only had passed since the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle ending the war of the Austrian Succession and already things were making up for the Seven Years War between Frederick the great and Marla Theresa with its counterpart here in our French and Indian War. 20 •» o rtf lilgil This war it will be remembered, ran fr«m 1756 to the Peace of Paris in 1763. Undoubtedly the young ‘‘Johann goerg feickH would have been pressed into military ser¬ vice had he remaineii in the fatherland much beyond his sixteenth birthday and we may well picture him as being filled with a spirit of rebellion because of the cruelties his forebears had suffered. The family undoubtedly had been there in the Rhine Valley for generations. They had suffered the hardships of the Thirty Yeats V/ar between the Protestants and the Catholics starting in 1618 and ending with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Then had followed the wars of Louis XIV including the v/ar respecting the Spanish Netherlands 1667-1368; The war with Holland 1672-1678; the war against the Palatines 1389-1697 and the war of the Spanish Succession 1701-1714. Then followed numerous minor outbreaks and the war of the Aus:.-ian Succession ending in 1748. Cf the war of the Palatinate, the historian, Meyers, says in his Cutlines: “Louis ordered that cou ntry to be turned into a desert. The Huns of Attila could not have carried out more relentlessly the barbarous command than did the soldiers cf Louis. Churches and Abbeys, palaces and cottages, villas and cities, were all given to the flames. Among the places laid in ruins were the historic towns of .. Heidelberg, Spires and and crops were destroyed. The homeless peasants, to the number of a hundred thousand, wandred about in abject misery, imprecating the vengeance of Heaven upon the heart¬ less tyrant who had caused their ruin.” Do we need m/>re to tell us why the Palatines were called the “Poor Pala¬ tines”, or why our young ancestor was among those shortly to leave such a country and make their way down the Rhine to Rotterdam and thence over the Atlantic to the City of Brotherly Love? Nothing has come down to us as to how long Johann goerg felck remained in Philadelphia nor have we any information as to how he journeyed from there up to Brunswick in Albany County. There were no connecting roads between Philadelphia and New York at that early date, and while he may have made his way overland v/ith a party going toward New York, or up the Susquehanna Valley, the chances are that he made the trip by water to New York as was common at the timq and thence up the Hudson by sloop. Nor was there any connected road at that time between New York and Albany. It was not until about 1785, that a road was opened up the Hudson. Y/e do know however that on December 14 1755, five years after his arrival, he sat down at Brunswick in Pittstown Township, Rensselaer County, New --York, with his Martin Luther German Bible before him and in a spirit of re¬ ligious fervor wrote as follows: 22 • * £ i / '' ^ ~ 'S’ ?

Brunswick, December 14, 1756. The next record we have of his handwriting appears in his bible on July 15th, 1764, reproduced later herein, at which time his first child Christina was born. Two years after this event, he bought the farm where he lived most of his life and where he died on October 31, 1821, The deed for this property was made by Bastian Keyser and wife of “Pagkipsich” in Dutches County, husbandman, to George “Fages\" 24 of Albany County, husbandman. Dated August 22, 1766, but not acknowledged until October 11, 1791, and re¬ corded in Book 1 of Deeds for Rensselaer County on pages 19, etc., on October 3, 1792. The consideration was 135 pounds current New York money. The description recites that the land is part of tract located “in the County of Albany on the East side of Hudsons River near a place called Tomhannock” containing 1847 acres. The mete and bound description of the part conveyed to our ancestor reads as follows: “Begins at the Northwest corner of land this day be me released to Mathew Degardino and runs from thence South 83 charms, thence North 86 degrees West 25 chains, thence North 78 chains and 75 links, thence North 86 degrees East 25 chains to the place where it first began and containing 200 acres of land more or less.” The grantor, Keyser, had bought the property on June 5, of the same year, 1766, from Thomas Clark of New York City, and he signed his name Sebastian Keyserick not Keyser as the English scrivener spells the name in the body of the instrument. Those interested in the covenants and conditions of the old deeds of that period will note that it covers “all and singular the woods and underwoods, trees, timber, fidings, pastures, meadows, marshes, swamps, ponds, holes, rivers, rivulets, runs and streams of water, fishing, fowling, hawking 25 . ; and hunting, mines and minerals, gold and silver mines excepted and one-fourth part of all other minerals also excepted and the reversion and reversions, rents, issues and profits thereof and any part and parcel thereof” * * * * “excepting what is above excepted and the Kings quit rents which ar e now and shall hereafter grow due for the said two hundred acres, ” etc., and etc. This property, (see pictures on the next two pages), now, in 1943, comprises two farms and was so operated prior to the death of Johann goerg feick as re¬ ference to his will discloses. In 1941, I located this property and found the westerly one-half owned and occupied by a Mr. Frank Madigan and the easterly one-half owned by Mr. Clement Subcleff and his wife. It was indeed fortunate for our ancestor and his family that he did not settle on lands a few miles to the east in the Hampshire Grants where they would have suffered a questionable title and found themsel^ves mixed up in the armed rebellion incident to those grants. It was also fortunate that they did not settle in the Manor of Rensselaerwyck, directly to the south, because there they would have later been in the midst of the New York Rent War. The history of the Hampshire Grants, just over tht- Vermont Line, and the records of the New York State 26 Rent war make interesting and instructive reading, throwing light on seme of the difficulties incident to the land titles of that period and evidencing in= the settlers, a love of liberty ani a passionate de¬ sire for the private ownership of land free of all burdens and entailments. f t + \\ V % \\ % so L .. i_ The above shows the westerly one-half of the original Fake farm lying in Schaghticoke Township now occupied by Frank Madigcn. This property and the one shown on the next page, front on a road known in early days as the Northern Turnpike or road from Buskirk’s Bridge to Stone Arabia (later Lansingburgh) now in 1943 the road is known as Route 40-A.

Probably the same road. 27 ■ This picture shows the easterly one-half of the original Fake farm lying in Pittstown Town¬ ship now occupied by the Subcleffs. The residence of our ancestor was on this site and burned down many years ago. It was here that he died on October 31,1821. There is an old one-story abf\\ndoned school house (1941) opposite the driveway leading into the premises shown on the next page. The division line between the Towns of Schaghticoke and Pittstowm runs at the right of the above picture and it forms to this day the division line between the twTo farms as well as the line between the two towns. This property and the one shown on the preceding page is referred to in our ancestor’s will as partly in Schaghticoke and partly in Pittstown, 28 Old schoolhouse of District #12, Pittstown, taken in 1941. This building is almost directly cvoos’te to the roadway leading into the farm of John George Fake. 29 THE SUBCLEFF BUILDINGS CN THE SITE CF THE JOHN GEORGE FAKE FARM TAKEN IN THE FALL OF 1941 30 In March of 1304 I received a letter from Mr. Charles B. McMurray of Lansingburgh in which he re¬ fers to the property shown in the foregoing photographs. He wrote: “The family was one of importance and position and must have been for those days wealthy. About twenty years ago, I remember being driven somewhere between here and Housick Falls (I think) to the old homestead and seeing the slave cabins, etc., my impression is that this old house was soon after destroyed by fire. My mother had two old negresses, pensioners, a mother and a daughter long since dead. The mother was supposed to be over 100 years old, and she was the daughter of one of the slaves.” In another letter addressed to me on February 20, 1906, he wrote: “I might say in closing that I have seen the old slave houses and have an old wrought iron candle stick which was used in their quarters. In fact an old negress did not die until I was about ten years old. I think she was one of the slaves of the Fake family and had always been taken care of by my grandfather and mother w’ho gave her a nice little two story brick house and lot and pro¬ vided her with all the money she needed until her death.” Whether the Blacksmith Shop of Johann goerg was located on this property I do not know. In 1768 he bought a tract of twenty acres at Tomhannock from John Bastian Kyserrick, 31 y 7 Liber/of Deeds, Albany County page 580. In this deed he is referred to as a “blacksmith yeoman”, I have not as yet located this property. He also owned considerable other property in that section also hundreds of acres in Montgomery= County and in Ontario County, New York. Upon his death George Fake (Johann goerg feick) left the following last will and testament which was probated in Rensselaer County in the year 1822: “in the name of God Amen I George Fake of Pittstown in the County of Rensselaer pj. State of New York do make and publish this my last Will Testament in manner following that is to say First I will and devise and bequeath unto my daughter in law Clive Fake widow of my son Jacob Fake deceased one third part of the half of the farm on which I now live situate partly in the town of Schaghticoke h partly in the town of Pittstown in the County aforesaid to be by her possessed and improved during her natural life or while she continues the widow of Jacob Fake deceased Second I will devise bequeath unto the Children of my said son Jacob Fake Deceased the remaining two thirds of the half of the farm on which I now live situate in the towns of Pittstown & Schaghticoke aforesaid to be equally divided between 32 . them when the youngest of the said Children shall have ar¬ rived at the age of twenty one years and if any bf the said Children shall decease before they arrive to the age of twenty one years then his or her part or proportion shall go to the survivor or survivors.

No doubt at the time the will was executed he was ill or had become old and feeble and thus obliged to sign by mark. After the death of George Fake, George Fake, Jr., filed an inventory part of which is in the following language, spelling and punctuation: “One Note signed by George Fake Jnr Dated the Eleventh Day pf February 1815 of the sum of one hundred thirty Five Dollars Interest Five P C Paid on said Note the sum of Eighteen Dollars the 15th of January 1817 this Note was Given on Conditions by George Fake the money was Due From Nicholas Fake but Nicholas Living some Distance From his Father his Father Requested his son George to Give his Note For the money Cause he Where living Near his Father so if he should Want any money that he Could send any Day to his son George For Some George asking his Father Several times By the Request of his Brother Nichblas to Give up the Note to him on account of his Father Never had Given him anything. But Father said he Could Not Give it up While he Where Living Where he Did not Enow But he might Want it. - But after my decease You may Do With the Note as You Please” - then follows a long list of personal property, furniture, wagons, farm equipment and blacksmith's implements. 35 State of New York ) ss: Renssalaer County ) George Fake Executor of George Fake Deed, being duly sworn says that the foregoing contains a true & perfect in¬ ventory of all the personal estate of the said Dec'd as far as the same hath come to his hand possession or knowledge & further says not Sworn before me this 11th day of July 1822 George Fake. Th. Cleeves Surrogate. After this inventory had been filed trouble evidently arose in the family and Adam Fake being dissatisfied, filed the following petition:- “To Thomas Cleeves Esq Surrogate of the County of Rens¬ selaer The Petition of Adam Fake Respectfully represents that he is entitled to one half of the residue of the person¬ al estate of George Fake his father lately deceased & the in¬ fant children of Jacob Fake Deceased are entitled to the other half of the residue of the said Estate & that George Fake is the sole acting Executor of the said George Fake Deceased that the said George Fake has not in the opinion of your petitioner made .faithful application of the personal estate of the said 36 . George Fake Deceased your Petitioner therefore prays that the* said Executor may be cited to render his account of his administration of the said personal estate % your Petitioner will ever pray Adam Fake” “Rens. ss. Adam Fake above named being duly sworn says that the facts above stated are true Sworn before me this ?6th Ap 1825 Adam Fake 1} The Surrogate who took the testimony made the follow¬ ing minutes concerning the dispute some of which are rather obscure as to meaning (I give it verbatim et literatum). “Nicholas Fake (De Bene Esq) sworn says about 28 years ago he purchased 100 acres of land of his father for 150 lbs. and mortgaged the land for the payt also gave his bond for the money made some payments leaving a balance of $135 due 11 Feb'y 1815 the Dec*d gave up the Bond and Mortgage & took a note against G.

M. ” George Wetscek Jr sworn says he was an appraiser of the estate of G Fake Dec'd, says he was present when the chest of Dec’d was opened, says he understood that it contained a note of Nicholas Fake but he did not see it nor did he hear it from G. Fake nor does he know that it was said so in the hearing of G. Fake, says there was about $4.50 in the chest cash two dollars was claimed by V/m, Quackenbush as money out. A Fake agreed to George Fake admitted that his father held a note against him for more than 100” “John Fake sworn says G. Fake purchased land of his father gave a Bond & M & afterwards paid money on it wit saw it a number of years since”. “Olive Fake says 6 yrs ago last June N Fake came to see his. father who inquired of him whether he had brought him any money he said not}& promised to pay the following winter shortly afterwards same day N Fake desired his father to give up the note which he refused saying that he wanted it himself says that in the winter following Ex took out 7 dolls in specie out of the chest at different time from that testified to by witness”. 38 r - •- * “Adj’d 15th Sep at 10 A.

M Adj 27 at 2 P M” This dispute seems to have terminated in an allowance of 52£ to the petitioner and $10.35 to the heirs of Jacob, thus closing as far as the law could, what evidently was an old fashioned family quarrel over money matters. It gives us no clue however as to what happened to the large holdings of reai estate which he had owned in his life time or what became of the proceeds of their sales. If it were possible to project ourselves back to those early years in the wilderness between 1751 and 1760 when our youthful ancestor was finishing out his apprenticeship at some log-cabin blacksmith shop in the region of Tomhannock, and courting the young Maria Elizabeth Loanes (Lohnes), we woujd be amazed at the crudities of their surroundings and the complete abdence of the things which we look upon today as absolute necessities. Here and there, miles apart, a settler had hewed out an open space and rolled up a log-cabin, among them the Loanes (Lohnes) family, and every year a few more settlers filtered in. Johannes Knickerbocker had taken over a tract of some sixty acres and erected a log-cabin at Old Schaghticoke on the site of the present Knickerbocker brick mansion, a few miles north of our ancestors farm, and 40 was soon joined by other Dutch families who came in from Albany. A few settlers of German origin had settled at Brunswick and had built a log-cabin church at that place. The lands which nw comprise the region of Schaghticoke, Tomhannock, Brunswick and the other settlements in Pitts- town and Cchaghticoke Townships were, like practically all of New York State at that time, covered with a growth of primeval pines. Watering the region were numerous streams; The Tomhannock Creek and its tributaries; the Hoosac River with its many tributaries reaching over into Vermont and Massachusetts and not far to the Westward the placid Hudson flowed tothe sea with no settlements of any size on its shores, Albany at the time being a settlement of about two thousand and New York City from five to eight thousand. Grace Greylcck Niles in her interesting book, “The Hoosac Valley, Its Legends and Its HisteTy”, tells us much of the Indians of that section in those early days and pre¬ serves for us a fine picture of the Witenagemot Cak, planted by thewhite settlers and the Indians in 1676, in commemora¬ tion of a peace treaty made with the Indian chiefs Soguon and Maguon of the Hoosac tribe, after their victory over the Mohawks. Its weathered and rotting trunk with a few gaunt branches were all that remained of this tree when I visited 41 - v • the site on the Knickerbocker farm in 1S4I, It stands three or four miles north of our ancestor’s pia.ee. Indians still roamed the region when our an¬ cestor arrived and they raided the settlers in that vicinity on more than one occasion before the Revolution. V/hen Burgoyne advanced down the Hudson with his Indians in 1777, we are told tha- the settlers hurriedly remc^ed to Albany, V/iiliamstovTi and Stoekbridge to avoid the savages. Nothing has come dwwn to us as to where the family of our ancestor found refuge, b«-t we do know that he was a soldier in the Continental Army in the regiment of Colonel Peter Yates at the time. This regiment was made up of men beyond military age andl imagine that he was more interested in his family, his crops, his horses and cattle, and his blacksmith shop, than in the life of a soldier. His appearances in actual conflicts, as far as I have been able to ascertain, were occasioned only on alarms when the farmers went into battle in their homespuns, armed with their hunting knives, flint¬ lock rifles and powder horns and proceeded to such victories as the Battle of Bennington which by the way, was fought a very short distance to the Northeast of his place and the firing could easily have been heard at his farm. It should be remembered that the battle of Bennington was fought near Cambridge in New York State, nbt in Bennington, Vermont. 42 The log-cabins of the first settlers were very uninviting when based on our present day standards. Few if any of them had glass windows or wooden floors. The doors were of skins or ill fitting hand hewn logs. The fireplace, often poorly constructed, furnished the only source of heat and there the wife prepared all the meals. Boiling was done in pots “suspended over a wood fire from a crane. Frying or broiling was best accomplished in a i spider set on coals in front of the fireplace. Roasts were turned and browned on a spit. Bread, cakes, and all baked goods came from tin ovens set in front of the fireplace. A bake kettle set on coals with coals heaped on the lid gave quality which the modern oven cannot attain. All- night corn pone so baked sounds most appetizing. The wood used in fireplaces, either for cooking or for warming houses, was cut three feet long and rested on heavy andirons. *Logs eighteen to twenty inches in diameter rested on andirons of flat stones as back logs. Cook stoves, which came into use about 1850, did not supplant the fireplace cooking for two or three decades”. Such is the account by Hedrick in his, History of Agriculture In The State of New York. He also tells us that the housewives of the period had learned from the Indians how to cook Indian corn, pumpkins, squashes and beans and how* to dry wild plums, huckleberries, raspberries, black- 43 « . berries, corn, beans, pumpkin and squash, and that these formed part of every meal in winter furnishing appetizers, vitamins, and regulators. Fenimore Cooper in his, Chainbearer, tells of a tavern on the Great Northern road in 1774. Johann goerg feick’s farm fronted on the Northern Turnpike, probably the same road Cooper had in mind. The wife of the tavern keeper addressed the hero of Cooper’s novel as follows; and I quote: “You are Lucky Major Little-page, she said, in not having come among us in one of our starving times - and awful times they be, if a body may say what she thinks on ’em”. “Starvation is a serious matter at anytime” ‘I answered, though I did not know you were ever reduced to such difficulties in a country as rich and abundant as this.’ ‘Cf what use is riches and abundance if a man will do nothing but fish and shoot? I’ve seen the day when there wasn’t a mouthful to eat in this house, but a dozen or two of squabs, a string of brook trout, art! maybe a deer, or a salmon from the one of the lakes.’ - ‘A little bread would have been a welcome addition to such a meal.’ ‘Oh! As for bread, I count that for nothin! We al¬ ways have bread and potatoes enough: but I hold a family to be in a desperate way, when the mother can see the bottom of the 44 pork-barrel. Give me the children that’s raised on a good sound pork, afore all the game in the country. Game's good as a relish, and so’s bread; but pork is the staff of life! To have good pork, a body must have good corn; and good corn needs hoeing: and a hoe isn't a fish pole, or gun. No, My children I calker late to bring up on pork, v/ith just as much bread and butter as they may want! “This was American poverty as it existed in 1784.\" The furniture of the first cabins consisted of a slab table, peg-legged benches or stools and bunks or beds built on the side walls or in the loft of the one room. The dishes were of wood, spoons also were mofetly of wood, although here and there pewter spoons were in use. In some instances a few pewter dishes and steel knives and forks might be found. The printed matter consisted of a bible and perhaps a catechism which had the multiplication tables in the back of it as our ancestor's has. The agricultural implements of the time were of the crudest sort. The steel plow had not yet been thought of, rough clumsy wooden plows were used and more often the shares or mould boards were not even iron shod and the work of clearing the woodlands and bringing the land into cultivation presented Herculean tasks for men of brawn and muscle. Only the fittest survived, “it took about a year for a good woodsman to chop, log, plow, and sow ten acres of forest land.\" The 43 ' settlers aided each other in logging which gave rise to the expression of “log-rolling” in American politics. The logs were burned and ten acres would produce about a ton of potash which the settler could sell for £200, often his first cash return. This was a goodly sum in those days and one who had a capital of £150, after his farm was paid for was rated well-to-do. Many settlers started with little or nothing. Our ancestor however, being a blacksmith, undoubtedly had acquired some independence financially before his marriage and judging from what we know of his land operations extend¬ ing well out beyond the Hudson into the then West, he must have been among the more successful and we may well con¬ jecture that not many years elapsed before he abandoned his earlier cabin and erected a pretentious homestead for his fast increasing family. There is a story whibh is handed down as applying to most of the early settlements in New York. It strongly im¬ plies thatsome of our ancestors suffered with claustrophobia;- A soldier left his wife and children and went away in the Continental Army. After several years of military service with Washington he walked home from Philadelphia and after greeting his wife and children, he looked out over the valley and spied a clearing with a cabin erected some eight or ten miles off in the distance. Contemplating it for a while he 46 turned to his wife and said: “I ary, commence to pack up, v/e’r movin' out for Lentuck in the morning. This country is altogether too thickly populated to bring up a family in.” Cn a visit to Rensselaer County in the year 1305, I had the very great pleasure of meeting I t. Alfred 17. i..;ci .urray then a gentleman well along in years. Lis wife, ixugusta 2. was the daughter of Colonel John 3. Fake, she had passed on in 1834, so I was too late to meet her. She and her father, the Colonel, had taken a greater interest in preserving family records and heirlooms than any of the other descendants of Johann goerg feick and the 1 \"cxTurrays, Alfred. 7. and his son Charles 3. had carried on in the same fine tradition. You may imagine my delight then when they showed me for the first time the family bible of Johann goerg feick with the births and christenings of his children noted therein in his own ..-Tattdeutsch handwriting. Their home at Lansingburgh, evidenced the culture and refinement of genera¬ tions of solid r.merican stock. There they had the tall mahogany clock of Johamn goerg feick made by “..huban Ling” some time between 1750 and 1700. The works are of brass and noted in the clock are the dates when it was rep aired, /.ugust 25, 1784, July 10, 1847, June 25, 1881 and January 4, 1835, oiled November 15, 1303, January 50, 1310 and November 20, 1211. There they also have life-size oil paintings of 47 George Fake, Jr. and his wife and also of Colonel John 3. F^ke. They also had the powder horn and the bible, both of which will be described la.ter. The mahogany secretary of Colonel John S. Fake and his bedstead of the same wood furnish examples of the finest workmanship and design of their period. The bible of George Fake, Jr., and the many other books and manu¬ scripts in thfct home take one back over the years to the landing of the pilgrims on _L ly mouth Rock in lofC. Cn being shown the powder horn of our ancestor for the first time back in 1905, I remarked “I would give my right arm to own that horn”. Calling at the iTcl .urrays again in 1941, 1 was told I used the same expression again and well I might have for I must confess thett I have had a burning desire to possess that horn, from my early boyhood, and now through the kindness of iFrs. Eleanor i/.ci .urray, widow of Charles 3. i.Zci urray, and the kindness also of her daughter Augusta, who consented, I have possession of the horn until my death when it will pass to the Rensselaer County historical Society, and fortunately, ray arm wan not lost in the transfer. 48 THE & C3 :_iE The Eible of Johann goerg feick (Eake) is something to conjure with in wondering about its ante¬ cedents. It is a ilartin Luther edition printed in Ccr- man at Amsterdam, Holland in the year 1573. It is not a large book. It measures only 3-1/4 inches wide, 0 inches long and 3 inches thick. Its wooden covers are bound with leather and it closes with a hand- made brass clasp. Pressed into the leather is 1. 5. 8. 7.” 7/hat this connotes aside from the y*aar lu87 is suamothing to guess about. 49 FLY LEAF BIBLI A> SM* «|I : t s*S <, vV /%$**'*'* <• SL«»»6V *JVV fiac ©d'nfff / fltoo1 • • unt'Ou’U'C^Scliamcm^/ i QVrN'iiffcOf Mircf) £>.

My mother often told of talking with a lady whose maiden name was Peek residing near Kitidlcburgh, New York, who said the Fakes of Montgomery County and the Fecks of Schoharie County were the same family.

Aside from its sentimental value to us in whose veins flows the blood of the ancestor who carried it in early colonial days, it possesses a great intrinsic value as a collectors piece and to the lover of art and beauty it carries still further value. }t is the finest specimen I have ever seen. Carved at the top or neck of the horn is a blacksmith’s anvil with hammer and tongs crossed above it, then follows next below, the inscription, “Dieses Horn Georg Feck Gehort Mier”. Then the British Royal Coat of Arms most beautifully and skillfully done bearing the motto of the Prince of Wales “Honi soit qui mal y pense” (shamed be he w7ho thinks evil of it). Then follows “Dieu et mon droit” (God and my right ), two cannon mounted on wheels, two pyramids of cannon balls, three drums, two trumpets, two battle-axes, one musket, two lances or spears and four flags or banners. Under all this appears what are apparently the names of the makers “Gethan Von Mier Carolus Alexander Scherber anno 1762”. When George Fake obtained this horn is not known at this writing. The earliest authentic record of service by him that I have been able to find, is in the year 71 ■ 1767 when he was a private under Captain Thomas Ackerson in the Albany County Militia. There is a dearth of re¬ cords covering this early period in Albany County, but no able bodied man could have lived there very long in those days without being attached to a local military organiza¬ tion as a matter of self preservation. During the Revolu¬ tion he served as a member of the 14th Albany County Regi¬ ment under Colonel Peter Yates as appears by reference to Vol. 5 pages 61 and 62 of the Treasurer’s Certificates. The following is a copy of the Certificate of the Archivist: “November 22, 1S06. THIS IS TO CERTIFY that an entry on page 61 of a manuscript volume entitled “Certificate of Treasurer, vol. 5” in the cus¬ tody of Regents of the University of the State of New York, in the State Library, shows that in pursuance of an act passed April 27, 1784, entitled “An act for the settlement of the pay of the Levies and Militia, for their service in the late war, and for other purposes therein mentioned,”: a certificate for 1 lb. 2s. 6d. numbered 23813, and bearing interest from 1 June 1780, was issued for the service of Geo.

Draper, Commissioner of Education.\" 73 FAMILY (1) 1, John George Fake, spelled by him, Johann goerg feick, Feek or feck and on at least one occasion in 1803, fack, was born in Becherbach near Spires or a village of the same name near Coblenz, both in the Rhine Valley, in Germany, probably some time between 1733 and 1735, and died at PittstoW in Rensselaer County, New York on October 31, 1821. He married Maria Elizabeth Loanes or Lohans of that place and she died March 25, 1806. There were eleven children born of this marriage:- 2. Christina b. July 15, 1764 d. Aug. 28, 1850 3. Johan George Jr.b. Feb. 16, 1766 d. Feb. 21, 1856 4. Nicholas b. May 31, 1768 d. Feb. 1, 1853 5. Margaret b. Aug. 11, 1770 d. 6. Elizabeth b. July 25, 1773 d. 7. John Ray b. Mar. 5, 1776 d.

June 29, 1792 d. 74 The span cf the life of the head of this family, took him through the period df the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the V7ar of 1812, and covered the administrations of Presidents Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison and well into the administration of President Monroe. He therefore saw the early struggles, the birth, and the early years of our growth under the Constitution. He was a Whig, a Federalist, a follower of Hamilton in Politics and a Lutheran in Religion and would be classified today as a rugged individualist, which it is hoped his descendants and a strong majority of others may emulate now and to the end of time, Communists, Socialists, New Dealers and other impractical stargazers to the con¬ trary notwithstanding. We find him and his wife listed among the earliest members of the Gilead Lutheran Church at Brunswick. The census taker looked in on him for the » first census of 1790, and reported him as:- “George Feck”, i the head of a family at Pittstown, consisting of 2 white males, above the age of 16, 4 male children under 16 and 4 females. There were 10 children at that time and these figures include the husband and wife so it would appear that two of the children had left home when the census was taken. 75 Over the years attempts have been made to locate the cemetery in which our ancestor and his wife were buried but quite without success. At a very early time there was a cemetery about a quarter of a mile north of our ancestor’s farm. It had been cut out of the Green farm years before. The site is now on the farm owned by one Schmidt and at this writing but few head¬ stones remain. It is said that several of the old head¬ stones now are used as part of the floor of Schmidt’s cow stable and others were broken up in concrete and form part of the foundation walls of his horse stable. In this cemetery, a neighbor, Jesse Finne and his wife are buried and our ancestor’s grave is probably there also. Perhaps the stones which remain intact in the cow stable may settle the question if we can have them lifted. 76 FAMILY 1 - (2 ) 2. Christina Fake, was born at Brunswick in the Town of Fittstown, New York, July 15, 1764 and died August 28th, 1850, age 86 years and 23 days. She married Henry Dater of Dutches County, New York in the Gilead Lutheran Church at Center Brunswick, New York. I may not have a complete record of the children ef this marriage but I do have the follow ing:- John b. d. Henry b. Feb. 12, 1801 d. Hannah b. d. Philip b. d. Katherine b. d.

On December 6, 1931 at the age of 93 he sang the “Lost Chord” in the Gilead Church and in 1925 he was said to be the oldest vocal broad¬ caster in America if not in the world. The New York Times of May 6, 1932 carried the following when he died: CALVIN DATER “Troy, N; Y. May 5 (A?) - Calvin Dater, 94, who claimed to be the oldest radio singer, died today at the home in which he lived alone. Mr. Dater until a few days ago broadcast programs of old-time ballads from a Troy radio station.” Note: I am indebted to Mr. Abram }. Fake (Faiche) for the data relating to 2, Christina and her descendants. He obtained it from Calvin Dater and bibles in Calvin’s possession. 78 FAMILY 1 - (3 ) 3. John George Fake Jr., was born on his father’s farm on the Northern Turnpike near Tomhannock in the To^h of Pitts-* town, New York on February 1 6t h, 1766 and died in his ninety- first year cn February 21, 1856. He married Catherine « Sneider the 12th *f August 1787. The following entry ap¬ pears in his family biblet “Geo pake took to wife Catha the 12th day of August 1787. She was aged seventeen years three months and fifteen days and the age of Geo Fake was twenty-one years five months and twenty-seven days*’. There were six children of this marriage: 13. Mary Elizabeth b. Mar. 10, 1795 d, Feb. 13, 1869 14. Catherine b. Apr. 1, 1797 d. 15. George Fake b. Feb. 6, 1799 d. 16. John S. 17. Jacob 18. Henry b. Nov. 30, 1800 d. Jan. 11, 1876 b. Jan. 19, 1804 d. Sep. 16, 1861 b. Mar. 12, 1806 d. Dec. 31, 1884 The father of this family lived his entire life and raised his family at Pittstown, where he died. He was a man who took an active interest in public affairs. In “Landmarks of Rensselaer County” it appears that he was elected as one 79 FAULT 1— ( 3 ) CONTINUED of the school committee of his town at the annual meeting in 1813 and later in 1816 he was Supervisor of the town. # There are no official records cf the militia organ¬ izations in that part of the state from tno close of the Revolution until 1802. It is khown however that such organ¬ izations did exist prior to the latter date. He was but ten years of age in 1776 and seventeen when the peace treaty of 1783 was signed. Hostilities had eased long before that in his neighborhood so we must assume that he played no very active part in the Revolution. The McMurrays have life size oil paintings of George Fake Jr, and his wife Catherine, which still remain in their original frames. They also have his bible with his family records therein. He was a wealthy farmer and speculated in real estate on a large scale. In politics he was a Whig and a Federalist like his father. He and his wife are both listed as members of the Gilead Lutheran Church at Brunswick, now Centre Bruns¬ wick. The clock and the bible and powder horn of John George Fake (1) came into his possession after his father's death and passed to his son Colonel John S. Fake with the paintings, bible and horn above mentioned. 80 FAMILY 1 /* ; l-U: 4. Nicholas Fake was born on his father's farm on the Northern Turnpike near Tomhannock, in the Town cf Pittstown, Rensselaer County, New York, on May 31, 1768 and d’ed at Fords Rush, Minden, Montgomery County, New York in his 80th year on May 3, 1853. he married Mary Llizabeth Freiot or Frile. Her tombstone gives the latter family name and Bishop McLaren's records have it as FreicL She was born March 20th, 1770 and died at Fords Bnbi- on Christmas Day, December 25, 1851, in her 68th year. They are both buried in ML Hope Cemetery at that place. It may be that he married twice but no report of two marriages has come down to us. The difference in the spelling of the wife’s family name is probably accounted for by erroneous spelling in writing it without reference to the tombstone. We do not have the date of his marriage at this writing. We do know however that he remained In Pittstown until the year 1796 when he purchased a farm at Fords Bush lrom his father (1) and moved over there. He had the following children: 81 FAiHLY l-(4) CONTINUED 19. George b. Aug. 23, 1791 d. April 21, 1846 20. Joseph 21. John 22. Peter 23. Jacob 24. Isaac b. Oct. 4, 1794 d. Aug. 25, 1879 b.

Oct. 4, 1809 d. In Book 4 of Deeds in Montgomery County at page 507, there is a deed made by Jacob Lansing Jr. to George Fake (1) dated July 20, 1790, by this deed he became seized of a part of a tract of land on the south side of the Mohawk River near Canajoharie which originally contained 6000 acres granted by letters patent under the Great Seal of the Colony of New York in 1753 to Jacob Lansing and two other pessons. The part purchased by George (1) comprised some 218 acres known as lot 30 of the division and partition, for which he paid 218 pounds New York Currency. Gn January 2, 1796 by Deed 5- 240, he sold 109 acres thereof to his son Nicholas (4) for 150 pounds of the same currency. This farm remained in the possession and occupancy of Nicholas (4) until he died and it was here that he reared his family. 82 FAMILY l-(4) COirriKUED His first home on the tract was a log-cabin erected shortly before he moved over from Tomhannock with his family in 1796. It was not long however before he built a modest but substantial farm house which remains standing today (1942) in a weathered condition with its several additions and mammoth barns. He deeded this farm to his son Jacob (23) on January 10, 1837 and Jacob deeded a life estate therein back to his father. This farm remained in the ownership of the family for 118 years or until the year 1908, wrhen the then numerous heirs joined in a deed passing title to an outsider. The Lutheran Church at Fords Bush was organized April 30, 1836. The first services were held there in a school house. This organization was probably an outgrowth of the older Minden Church known as the Giessenberg Church at Hallsville and it was at these churches that Nicholas and his family attended religious worship. Our cousin, and one of his descendants, the Reverend Doctor Byron Fake, (148) preached there when our family (193) visited them at Fords Bush in 1899. Nicholas was said to be a great horse fancier, al¬ ways possessing one of the fleetest horses to be found in that vicinity and never allowed anyone to pass him on the road. In politics he was a Federalist and later, a Whig. 83 be . FAiTLY l-(4) CONTINUED V/hile he remained a farmer all of his life, he seldom did any physical work himself, at least this is the story handed down in the family. My grandfather who remembered him said he was always dressed in linen ruffled shirts, a swallow-tail coat and knee breeches with silver buckles. At the time of his death he had a slave which my grandfather often spoke of as a hard working and faithful servant. His grandchildren say he made them “toe the mark” in other words he was very strict with them and allowed no nonsense. The silver buckles are still in the possession of one of his descendants. His wife’s father was captured by the Indians in the V7ar of the Revolution and went some days without food save a small piece of venison and the bark of trees. Some Frenchmen bought him from the Indians and set him free. 4 ' •* . .- l- m •w**. - -.3 .

J. Fake in 1936. Some of the names znd dates are taken from records of John Ray furnished by the Veterans’ Administration at Washington. In Landmarks of Rensselaer County by George Baker Anderson, 1897, it appears that John Fake, the head of this family, was an Ensign in the 45th Regiment New York Militia in the year 1809, in 1811 he was a Lieutenant and in 1812 a Captain in that Regiment. He was present at the invasion of Plattsburgh. The Veterans’ Administration state in a letter, that his widow Susannah, was allowed 160 acres of bounty land in full satisfaction for his services on an application made by her in 1864, at which time she was about seventy-one years of age and residing in Cherry Valley, Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1878 she was back at Brunswick in the To*n of Pittstown, New York. She and her daughter Rebecca Maria are buried in the Brick Church Burial Ground at that place. 90 - FAMILY 1 - (8) 8.

The school house stands today (1941) abandoned and passing into decay on the northerly side of Route 40A. It is nearly opposite a lane leading to the farm of our first ancestor John George (1). 92 - FAMILY 1-(10> 10. Jacob Fake was born on his father's farm on the Northern Turnpike near Tomhannock in the Town of Pittstown June 4th, 1785 and lived there until his death on February 22, 1816. He married Olive Francisco of that place and she died November 25, 1865. Their grave stones were still standing in 1941 in a much neglected cemetery of the Lutheran Church at Melrose, a few feet off of Route 40A and a short distance from the ancestral farm. Jacob's headstone recites that he was aged 30 years 8 months and 18 days. “He was a kind parent and an affec¬ tionate husband\". Olive's headstone recites that she was the wife of Jacob Fake and that she died November 25,-1865 age 75 years 4 months and 21 days. They were living with our first ancestor on his farm and the widow and children continued on the farm until after the death of John George Fake (1) in 1821. There were four children of this marriage and they were provided for in the Will of John George Fake (1) see page 32. 40. Katherine E. b. July 25, 1811 41. John G. H. b. Jan. 22, 1812 ? 42.

Adam Fake was born on his father’s farm on the Northern Turnpike near Tomhannock in the Town of Pitts¬ town, July 31, 1788 and died in the Town of Gorham, Ontario County, New York on May 10, 1868. His father’s bible gives his birth date as 1788, see page 69, but his tombstone says 1792. He married first Sarah (Sally) Francisco a granddaughter of John and Sarah (Mandeville) Francisco. She was born August 31, 1792 in or near the Town of Pittstown and died at Gorham November 1, 1836. There v/ere six children of this marriage: 44. Adam b. d. f 45. George Henry b. Jan. 27, 1811 d.

Aug. 14, 1911. 95 FAMILY - l-(ll) - Continued At the time of the death of John George Fake (1) in 1821, his son Adam Fake, (11) was undoubtedly living with him or perhaps on the westerly one-half of the ancestral farm. On November 11, 1817, ten days before John George Fake (1) (George Fake) executed his Will, he made a Warranty Deed to his son Adam (11) conveying to Adam (11), a one-half or equal moiety of, in and to the whole 200 acre ancestral farm. This farm was no doubt being run as two separate farms at the time since John George (1) refers in his Will to the one-half of the farm on which he then lived and devised to Olive, widow of his deceased son Jacob (10) one-third of that half for her life and two-thirds of that half to her children. The Will is entirely silent as to the remaining one-half of the farm on which he did not live. It is interesting to note that the deed to Adam (11), while dated November 11, 1817, was not formally acknowledged and recorded until May 5, 1823 when the disputes before the Surrogate were pending, I have found no deed or deeds of record to clear this situation up. If it ever becomes necessary for anyone to obtain deeds for the half % undisposed of hundreds of signatures would be required. However the statute of limitations at this late day fortunately puts such questions at rest. John George (1) having disposed of a one-half interest in the half of the farm on which he lived to Adam (11) before he died, left only a half to be divided between 96 FAMILY - I- (11) - Continued his daughter-in-law Olive and her children, and not the whole of the half on which he lived. On June 28, 1826 Adam (11) and his wife conveyed the undivided one-half df both farms to James Green who lived across the road to the north but the deed was not recorded until 1840. Before that however, it appears that John Francisco, probably a brother of Olive had made a deed to her conveying the whole 200 acres. This deed dated and re¬ corded October 20, 1825, recites thdt John Francisco obtained title by a deed from Moses Warren, Esq. Sheriff dated <D0tober 11, 1825, but there is no such sheriff’s deed on record. There is a Certificate of Sale however filed in the County Clerk’s office. Question therefore arises as to what the Sheriff’s sale was based on and whether Adam’s interest was affected by that sale. These questions are interesting and some time in the future I may make an exhaustive attempt to answer them just to satisfy my own curiosity. The statute of limitations precludes any thought of gain for any of us even if we were mercenary. Back in those years there was a care¬ less disregard for the advantages of recording deeds and in many instances the record titles are left with lapses when undoubtedly deeds were given at the time and lost. For example thefirst deed to our ancestor was not recorded until afterthe lapse of twenty-six years from its date. 97 ■ .FAMILY - 1 - (11) Continued On April 9th, 1816 at a public meeting “Adam Feak” was elected Collector for School District No. 12 of Pittstown, Rensselaer County. He left Rensselaer County some time between 1827 and 1832, moving to Ontario County where he was Supervisor of the Town of Gorham in 1835. FAMILY 1-(12) 12.

The fathEr of this family George Fake (15) left Pittstown about the year 1850 and wrent to San Francisco, California. NOTE: There was another George Fake, the captain of an English vessel who settled in San Francisco in 1850. His descendants were still living in Oakland, California in 1934. They trace their ancestry in England for several generations back of the captain. Obviously this family has no connection with John George Feick (1) from whom we are descended. 101 FAMILY l-3-(16> 16. Colonel John S. Fake, son of <3), was born in the town of Pith°fow^, November 30. 1800 and died at Lansingburgh, Trov, New York. January II, 1876. He married Eli.za Warren, a Mayflower descendant. There was but one child of this marriage: 63. August b. March 9, 1835 d, Jan. 20. 1894 This family resided at Lansingburgh, a suburb of Troy^here Colonel Fake occupied a position of prominence and respect. His home, one of the finest in the Village, was the scene of many social gatherings. In 1845 he was the Clerk of the Village and from 1843 to 1856 he was Village president. A large land owner and investor in real 0 estate he was instrumental in founding the Rensselaer County Bank in 1853 and became its President. On July 13, 1872 the bank was obliged to discontinued business through the irregu¬ larities of one of its employees and it will ever redound to the credit of the Colonel that he saw to it that all the creditors were satisfied and largely out of his own personal estate. I have been unable to ascertain how he obtained the rank t>f Colonel but assume it was conferred upon him for ser¬ vices in the militia during the old field days when citizens met gather Informally for military drill.
