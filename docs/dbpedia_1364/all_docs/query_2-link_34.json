University Programs provides UA students with cultural, educational, recreational, and entertainment experiences. Eight committees along with committee chairs and their executive officers select, schedule, and produce events such as concerts, movies, lectures, fine arts performances, and galleryexhibits. University Programs provides excellent opportunities to develop leadership skills and to gain practical experience in a variety of areas. Supported by an activity fee instituted in 1988, the events are free to the student body.\n\nHeadliner Concerts Committee (HCC)\n\nHeadliner Concerts Committee (HCC), which is composed primarily of students, gets to make the decision on what big-name artist to bring to campus each year. Because you have already paid a per-credit-hour fee to support this committee, when concert day arrives there is NO admission fee for students. Previous headliners include Grammy winning artists John Mayer, Foo Fighters, rapper T.I., Blake Shelton, Third Eye Blind, Snoop Dogg, The Flaming Lips, Kip Moore, and More!\n\nDistinguished Lectures Committee (DLC)\n\nDistinguished Lectures Committee (DLC) decides which dynamic and pertinent speakers to bring to the University of Arkansas campus. These speaking engagements are completely free to all students. Some of the speakers brought over the past few years have been President George H.W. Bush, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, basketball icon Magic Johnson, author Malcolm Gladwell, Jane Goodall, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Elie Wiesel, Steve Wozniak, and John Legend.\n\nRegistered Student Organizations"
