        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - A former University of La Verne student was set to appear in court Tuesday on felony charges for allegedly fabricating a hate crime on campus last year.\n\nPolice say Anayeli Dominguez Pe単a, 25, of Ontario, was behind a series of reported threats against members of a student group at ULV in Feb. 2019, which escalated to the point of classes being cancelled.\n\nInvestigators with the La Verne Police Department looked into what they say were nine additional incidents beyond the initial reported threat, including the discovery of a \"backpack emitting smoke\" inside an unlocked vehicle in a dormitory parking lot.\n\nPolice say most of the threats were delivered via email or text message and were directed at ULV, student activist group Decolonize ULV, and Pe単a herself.\n\nProsecutors say Pe単a reported the false threats to police and applied for victim compensation from the California Victim Compensation Board.\n\nInvestigators presented the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for filing of criminal charges, including one felony count each of criminal threats and perjury by declaration as well as six misdemeanor counts of false report of a criminal offense and one misdemeanor count of internet/electronic impersonation.\n\nBail was set at $136,000. Pe単a is scheduled to appear Tuesday in Superior Court.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, she faces up to eight years in state prison."
