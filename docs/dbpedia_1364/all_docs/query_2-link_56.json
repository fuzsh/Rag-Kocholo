        "text": "February 28, 2012\n\nThis is one of those books that makes you smile at the end because it is a complete story. Tyson and Lynay have both been hurt by love but learn that when some one loves you truly you can trust them.You take a journey with this couple while fall in love and you see that you don't mess with Tyson's family or he will come after you.I like this author I can not wait to read more from her.\n\nJanuary 11, 2011\n\nFrom what I can tell this is Erosa Knowles’ first book, and in my opinion it was well written. I was looking forward to reading this book because it had many elements that I enjoy (bw/wm romance, single female, contract marriage, betrayal, humor and, love).\n\nOne suggestion I do have before I say anything about the book itself is about the book description. I think that it could be shortened; it gives away information that could be just found out by the reader by reading the book.\n\nMajor Tyson Bradford was a man of many women’s dreams. He was good looking, he had a muscular build, he had a career (military), he owned his own home, and he had his own money. Like I said what woman wouldn’t want him just on that alone? He was also a kind, and giving person, who was protective of those he loved. His only short-coming was that he was a little jaded when it came to the fidelity of women, because of his ex-wife Allison (I won’t say too much more about her, you will just need to read the book).\n\nLynay is a great mom, she may hover a bit, but it’s understandable because her son does suffer from severe asthma. You can tell her son’s well-being comes first with her. Her problem is that she too is jaded about relationships, because of how badly her son’s father treated or should I say mistreated her.\n\nWhen these two meet to settle the arraignment that Tyson’s sister conveniently suggested would be the best option, sparks on a physical level fly. Unfortunately, neither one wants to really do anything about it because of past relationships or do they? (no spoiler here.LOL)\n\nThe pace and the length of the book was good, and the storyline was great. The background information on Lynay and Tyson was just enough so you could understand why they were so cautious without going overboard. The mixture of the secondary characters helped add to the story and made the story much more interesting.\n\nI was expecting a lot drama and vengefulness because of the ex-wife, as indicated on the back cover, but I wasn’t expecting the type that did unfold, especially the parts between Lynay and Tyson. I do think the way the ending part with the ex-wife Allison played out could have been handled a little differently, but then again maybe not (read it for yourself, and see what you think). There was also just the right amount of passion between Lynay and Tyson.\n\nI definitely look forward to more from Erosa Knowles!!\n\nWant to read\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\nThe biggest problem I had was the poor quality of the writing. The characters weren't fleshed out enough and there was a huge problem with the way passage of time was handled. You would finish reading a passage and from the ending of one paragraph to the beginning of the next bam, three months had passed. Yes it could be done but when you're attempting to convey the depth of a bond that is forming you need to put in some work. Now let's talk about implausible plots and the build-up of characters that you then do nothing with. We have a batcrap crazy ex-wife who supposedly comes from a family that is career military. The way this chick was acting, someone in her family would have put her behind on lockdown quick fast and in a hurry. On top of that we have a child who is sickly enough that his mother considers marrying a stranger for the medical benefits but after the union takes place, he abruptly seems to be doing better. Don't get me started on the sex scenes. If we're going to use crude sexual terms than do it. If however, you want to use euphemisms, do it. Don't randomly switch back and forth between the two. It's jarring to go from that special \"c\" word to \"her hard little nubbin.\" Mentally, I'm just not that flexible any more. If we're doing porn, we're doing porn. Don't mix it up with fluff. That being said the most annoying thing about this was, it could've been really good, hopefully some editor will get ahold of this author and smooth out the rough edges. I'll keep a wary but hopeful eye on this author.\n\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nI ENJOYED this story! The premise was believable,people in the REAL WORLD marry for ALL kinds of reasons other than LOVE. The main characters were likeable and realistic. The chemistry between them was EXCITING! Even the secondary characters held my interest.\n\nI don't want to reveal too much in this review because the book should be read and enjoyed.This is my first book by Ms. Knowles and I've got another of hers to be read,so keep up the good writing Ms. Knowles!\n\nJuly 17, 2011\n\nLynay and Tyson married one another out of something they both needed from each other. From their \"compatibility\" meeting they were instantly attracted to one another, and their sexual tension just escalated from there. It was very honorable how they both agreed to be faithful during Tysons deployment even though they were essentially in a contract marriage. I would say this book focused more on the romance aspect of their relationship then previous books I've read from this author and I liked that. The love scenes were good, and the conflict was totally unexpected, but added a nice spice to the plot. Overall a very enjoyable read.\n\nOctober 29, 2015\n\nTyson and Lynay were a nice pair, they definitely had some strong chemistry. Although at one point I wanted to hit Tyson for being stupid and almost losing his family over a misunderstanding and completely losing his cool. I blame Tyson's mom and Allison, his ex-wife, for making the poor guy have trust issues, but especially Allison because she was beyond crazy and delusional and the cause behind Tyson's big misunderstanding. Luckily, Lynay eventually forgave him and they could be a family again. HEA for everyone, well except Allison of course. >_<\n\nJune 29, 2013\n\n4.5 stars. I truly loved this book. Tyson and Lynay makes such a beautiful couple. And Seth, what a cutie little 4 year old. Loved Aunt Lily with her spunk and Anne, girl she was my Shero. What a man had so much hurt in the past with love that didn't know who to trust again. His ex wife, I wish I was inside this story to beat the shit out of her. Oh and Blue, sexy as Chocolate man, he needs a story, please. Bravo to Ms. Knowles. Loved it.\n\nJune 8, 2011\n\nI really enjoyed this book. I can honestly say it is one of the most well written interracial romances that I've read. I loved the two leads as individual characters and was intrigued by the basis of their relationship and watching that develop. Also there is a real plot/mystery to solve. The book was resolved nicely.\n\nSeptember 26, 2011\n\nThis storyline was so well written that it became very difficult for me to stop reading because of the anticpation of what would happen next. Erosa Knowles has no doubt been added to my list of favorite interracial/multicultural authors.\n\nGreat Read glad i made the investment.\n\nOctober 31, 2017\n\nSpecial Forces\n\nIt was a good read, nice story. There were some great love scenes and their fight scene among the Bradfords was my fav. There were some grammatical errors which is the reason for 3 stars rather than 4 stars.\n\nMarch 20, 2011\n\nI really liked this book. There was a real story and a connection with the characters.\n\nFebruary 8, 2011\n\nPretty decent read for a first attempt. Some part felt a little rushed, but the premise was good.\n\nNovember 13, 2017\n\n4.00 stars. After voice over rereading. The book is well written and the marriage of convenience featuring a military man as protagonist adds to its appeal. My problem with the book is two fold: first, I have a personal affinity against one member of a couple being the parent of a small child. I would have preferred that Lynay Grant be a recently terminated struggling student suffering from severe bouts of asthma; secondly, the primary villain, Allision, Major Tyson Bradford's ex-wife is unnecessarily reduced from an educated military brat who cheated on her husband and now wants him back to a crazy bigoted whore who will sleep with one in a uniform. This characterization of Allision doen't fit the kind of woman Tyson would have married considering his obsession with fidelity due his mother's unfaithfulness to his father. The other elements of the story were great, both Tyson and Lynay had dated outside their respective races and being an interracial couple was not an issue for them. I enjoyed 'watching them fall in love and over come their trust issues . Good story.\n\nAugust 20, 2014\n\nThis is my introduction to this author's work. The concept was interesting. There were many layers to the makeup of ALL the characters. Yet, it wasn't believable fiction. However, that was fine most of the time. But believing a protective mother with a history full of mistrust due people she loved hurting & letting her down, would take someone to meet their young child then move in with him? No. There were other elements that can go under the \"artistic liberties\" umbrella. ...but the introduction of the white supremacy group? Regardless of the situation, they wouldn't talk willingly to the racially diverse group of agents & military in their home. Would not happen.\n\nAlthough this book received pretty decent reviews, it reads a little amateurish. However, the writer presents to have great potential. I may give her one try.\n\nOctober 9, 2015\n\nWell well well, this was a bit of a surprise. I purchased this book without reading the sample and hoped for the best... I actually enjoyed this one very much.\n\nWhy you might add? Well I am a sucker for men who step up and became great fathers to children who aren't theirs... actually I find that that makes the male characters even more attractive... which was most def the case in the book.\n\nNow at first I was like NO not another \"loveless marriage\" however after I read the details.. I was I was in love with it.\n\nThis book had just enough of everything to keep me entertained... however if the whole saga around allison could have been a bit different I probably would have rated it 5 stars. I just didn't like the way that whole thing ended.\n\nNevertheless enjoyed this book very much\n\nAugust 29, 2015\n\nThis is my first book by Erosa. I must say the writting was phenomenal. The flow of the story worked. You felt like the story progressed at a real state, not being rushed. I love her style of story telling and will be reading more of her work. Tyson and Lynay were an amazing couple. The supporting cast was just as amazing. Seth was too cute. Anne was Lynay ride or die friend/sister. Aunt Lilley was a cute popper and will check you no matter who you are. Even Blue was a great added support in the story. Great job.\n\nJanuary 26, 2012\n\nI liked the story. But the way it was written how the story flowed was poor. The author was very repetitive and at some points she did not explain things thoroughly enough. At one point she spoke about a person you had no clue to which she was referring. Also she gave great details in the middle of conversations so much so that you had to go back and look at what the last person said to understand where the conversation was headed. Overall it was a great story but it needed better structure.\n\nSeptember 21, 2013\n\nI enjoyed this book,but felt like it was extremely rushed in the middle. I wanted to read more about Tyson and Lynay's relationship. I also wanted a little more tension and time when they first met. It's like they met, and then he left.\n\nOverall, great story that reminded me s lot of \"The Grunt\", which is one on my favorite books.\n\nJune 29, 2011\n\nI really enjoyed the story even when it totally turned toward the end from a romance to a special ops investigation. The characters were fun and the story took interesting turns through out. It was a fun read.\n\nJuly 10, 2011\n\nI really enjoyed this book, I like how the author let me see what each character had to deal with and the obstacles that they had to deal with, even though our guy had more issues than our lady, agin a really good read, wish it was longer\n\nJune 7, 2013\n\noh really now...a marriage of convenience i can totally understand but the development of the story was confusing and lacked substance. they sounded fake (yes i know its fiction) the chemistry wasn't there at all.\n\nAugust 31, 2014\n\nI loved this book. I didn't want to put it down. I.read it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything. This is book is about a friend helping a friend out and her brother fell in love with what was supposed to be just temporary.\n\nDecember 26, 2019\n\nEnjoyed this one\n\nGood storyline, well written with few typos . The characters were believable and storyline had a bit of suspense. I enjoyed reading this book. So many IR books are about quick sex and no storyline. Not the case with this one.\n\nApril 4, 2019\n\nRare really good read.\n\nUsually, these books are formulaic with tons of heat and little substance. This book had both. Lynel and Tyson wee a good match. Only 4 stars due to some incorrect word use and a weird plot point that didn't fit.\n\nMay 21, 2019\n\nMarvelous!!\n\nI couldn't put this book down! The entire story was well written and I couldn't wait to find out what happened to Allison. I going shopping for another Erosa book. Happy reading!!\n\nJanuary 25, 2018\n\nDecent\n\nWorth the read. It appears some people don't like losing. Want to have their cake and eat it also without regard for others\n\nFebruary 26, 2019\n\nKids 😍\n\nSome parts she went into details too long and other parts I wish she spent more time. I always enjoy when kids are apart of the story\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nThe love of family is what this story is about\n\nMaj. Tyson Bradford was headed to another mission to Afghanistan, but he didn't want to leave his elderly Aunt Lilly without care. His sister Anne's best friend Lynay was in a pickle too and needed help with somewhere to stay and medical help for her son Seth. Who would believe that their arranged marriage ended in love? But, his ex-wife Allison wasn't as accepting and threw a big monkey wrench in Tyson and Lynay's marriage. Lynay was devastated that Tyson didn't think she had integrity. But her cousin's mother-in-law gave her excellent marriage advice. Train up a man early in the marriage. Allison didn't know how deep of a grave she'd dug for herself. With the help of Anne and her husband Raul, they were able to clean up the mess that Allison started.\n\nI loved this story. It shows that family isn't always blood but who you love and care about. Seth captured the heart of not only Tyson but also Tyson's elderly Aunt Lilly. Having a child around her revitalized her life. Tyson had to deal with some serious baggage from his past life which caused him to overreact to the bomb that Allison set off. He came to realize that family was all he craved and just being around Lynay and hearing her voice was a healing balm to his soul. In the end, Tyson, Lynae, and Seth got the loving family and HEA they all needed.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nTyson and Lynay…\n\nThe Major wasn’t planning on marrying again, his first marriage left a foul taste in his mouth, not to mention his own mother wasn’t a woman’s of virtue and he definitely don’t want to be like his father. Well, his sister came with an idea that would be beneficial to both him and her best friends, Lynay. He hesitated but after meeting the beautiful Lynay …\n\nAnyway, the crazy ex is not going to make it easy for them… You will have to buy your own copy and see .\n\nI love little Seth , aunt Lilly is something else.\n\nAnne, you are the best friend that every girl needs!\n\nTyson, made me so mad at his reaction to the pictures… seriously,major!!!!"
