        "text": "The Justice Department is battling to save a federal law that makes it illegal to lie about being a war hero, appealing two court rulings – including one involving a Pomona man – that the statute is an unconstitutional muzzle on free speech.\n\nThe fight could be carried all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it would face an uncertain fate, legal analysts said.\n\n“This is a Supreme Court that is friendly to parties asserting speech rights and skeptical about restrictions on those rights,” said Kannon Shanmugam, a former Justice Department official.\n\nSupporters of the law take the opposite view.\n\n“It could wind up being the kind of landmark decision that the Supreme Court is going to have to give very serious and very broad consideration to, and I think they’ll come down on our side,” said Doug Sterner, a military historian.\n\nA local legal expert said he is not sure what will happen.\n\n“The question is does the court want to make a hole in that law?” said Charles S. Doskow, University of La Verne dean emeritus and professor of law. “It seems to me they don’t but no one’s really sure. When the facts are as obnoxious as the military funeral case, who knows what’s going to happen.”\n\nDoskow is referring to the case of Albert Snyder, whose son died in 2006 in Iraq. Church members in Topeka, Kan., protested the funeral. Members said the U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are God’s punishment for the country tolerating abortion, homosexuality and immorality. The case has not yet been decided.\n\nThe Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime punishable by up to a year in jail to falsely claim to have won a military medal, whether or not an impostor seeks financial gain.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and a federal district court in Denver have both ruled the law is unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.\n\nLast week, government lawyers in California asked the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the ruling, calling it a decision of “exceptional importance.” Prosecutors noted that the three-judge panel was split 2-1 with sharply differing views, and that the law is also under challenge in Colorado.\n\nThe 9th Circuit hasn’t said whether it will take a second look.\n\nIn Colorado, prosecutors announced last week they would ask the 10th Circuit to overturn the district court decision. That appeal is expected to be filed in early November.\n\nThe Stolen Valor Act, which breezed through Congress in 2006, revised and toughened an existing statute that forbade anyone to wear a military medal that was not earned.\n\nThe California and Colorado cases were among the early prosecutions under the newly strengthened law.\n\nXavier Alvarez, a Three Valleys Water District board candidate from Pomona, was indicted in 2007 after saying at a public forum that he was a retired Marine who received the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military decoration. Alvarez never served in the military.\n\nAlvarez pleaded guilty on condition that he be allowed to appeal on First Amendment grounds. The 9th Circuit ruled in his favor in August. His attorney, Jonathan Libby, said last week he believes both the full 9th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court would also find the law unconstitutional.\n\nLibby could not be reached for comment Monday.\n\nRick Glen Strandlof, who founded a veterans group in Colorado Springs, was arrested in 2009 after claiming he was an ex-Marine who was wounded in Iraq and had received the Purple Heart and Silver Star. The Marine Corps said it had no record that Strandlof ever served.\n\nA Denver federal judge threw out the case against Strandlof in July.\n\nHis attorney, Robert Pepin, said he is optimistic about winning at the appeals court or at the Supreme Court.\n\n“It really ends up being a very interesting argument, with solid arguments on our side and strongly articulated arguments on their side,” he said.\n\nIf government lawyers can’t persuade the appeals courts to revive the law, they will likely ask the Supreme Court to hear the case, said Shanmugam, who served as the Justice Department’s assistant solicitor general under President George W. Bush. The solicitor general is the government’s top lawyer in arguments before the Supreme Court.\n\n“When a federal court declares a federal statute unconstitutional, the solicitor general feels a strong obligation to defend the statute, where a reasonable argument can be made,” Shanmugam said.\n\nThe Associated Press and Staff Writer Wes Woods II contributed to this report."
