        "text": "From Glenn Thomas:\n\nI wanted to update everyone that was supportive in our efforts to give the late Rich Ferraiolo a dignified Funeral and Memorial Mass.\n\nToday, we had a wonderful ceremony at Holy Name Church. Many of Rich’s friends were on hand. Some friends even made the trip to Brooklyn from New Jersey.\n\nI want to thank Pete Iulo for putting this special day together. I would also like to thank Billy Mackay and Brian Lang for their generosity. A special thank you to Dan and Jimmy Sturges from MJ Smith & Sons Funeral Home for their kindness and understanding.\n\nI would also like to thank Yvonne and Sharon Smith who did a wonderful job in their coordinating of the music in today’s Mass.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Holy Name Pastor Father Larry Ryan for saying a beautiful Mass and making people feel good that Rich received a dignified and beautiful sendoff.\n\nIf there is anyone that would still like to make a donation in Rich’s memory that will go directly to The Holy Name Father’s Guild that helps support the youth sports programs in our Parish, I will repost the GoFundMe link. If you don’t do GoFundMe but still want to help you can inbox me for more information.\n\nThank you all.\n\n-Glenn\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001 I was driving to class at Central Michigan University.\n\nIt was between 8:30 and 9. The sun was shining, the sky was clear and there was a cool breeze in the air.\n\nMy wife Mary called me. It should be mentioned she was calling from work, we shared a cell phone. I thought it was an odd time for her to call.\n\n“They bombed the World Trade Center,” she told me.\n\nAs I was driving, thinking about my next class, I really didn’t understand what she meant.\n\n“WHAT?” I answered.\n\nShe said terrorists hijacked airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center.\n\nNo way, I thought to myself. When I lived at 228A Prospect Park West, from my rooftop I could easily see the Towers along with the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWhen I arrived at the building where my class was located, there were a group of students watching a television mounted to the wall, CNN was showing live video of the towers on fire. 8:46 a.m. was when the first plane slammed into the North Tower.\n\nTwo planes would be crashed into the North and South Towers. The South Tower was hit at 9:03. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story buildings came crashing down.\n\nIt was a terrifying image, one I will never forget.\n\nThere were nearly 3,000 people killed that morning, Captain Vincent Brunton of Truck Company Ladder 105, was one of them. Vinny was one of the best from our neighborhood, he was on the job in the World Trade Center doing his job…saving people. Rushing into a burning building to save people when the people are trying to get out. The ultimate sacrifice.\n\nVinny attended Holy Name grammar school and Bishop Ford High School. He was an excellent athlete too. I recall watching him run point guard in the schoolyard during the summer league. Loved his passion playing football for Farrell’s down at Farragut Road.\n\nRIP Vinny. (Jan. 2, 1958-Sept. 11, 2001)"
