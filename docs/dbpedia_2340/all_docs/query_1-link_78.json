        "text": "Events on This Day\n\n1682 - Edmund Halley got his only look at the comet that now bears his name. He worked out a theory of cometary orbits and concluded that the comet of 1682, otherwise known as Halleyâs Comet, was periodic and correctly predicted that it would return in 76 years.\n\n1781 - This is the birthday of one of the most written-about, talked-about, joked-about cities in the world, Los Angeles, California. The Mexican Provincial Governor, Felipe de Neve, founded El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles on this day. It was originally named Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula by Gaspar de Portola, a Spanish army captain and Juan Crespi, a Franciscan priest, who had noticed the beautiful area as they traveled north from San Diego in 1769. El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles translates into the Village of our Lady, the Queen of the Angels ... L.A. for short.\n\n1833 - Barney Flaherty answered an ad in The New York Sun and became the first newsboy. Actually, Barney became what we now call a paperboy. He was 10 years old at the time. Show us a 10-year-old who reads a newspaper today. Those were the days! Of course, there was no radio, no TV, no MTV, no computers, no Internet. What was a kid to do?\n\n1862 - General Robert E. Lee invaded the North for the first time, with 50,000 Confederates. He headed for Harpers Ferry, located 50 miles northwest of Washington. The Union Army, 90,000 strong, under the command of McClellan, was in hot pursuet.\n\n1882 - Thomas Edison displayed the first practical electrical lighting system. The Pearl Street electric power station, Edisonâ's steam powered plant, began operating and successfully turned on the lights in a one square mile area of New York City.\n\n1885 - As you pile that delicious platter of stuff on your tray, grab an extra dessert just for the fun of it and enough packets of sugar to last a year ... keep in mind that on this day, the Exchange Buffet opened in New York City. It was the first self-service restaurant in the U.S.\n\n1886 - Geronimo surrendered to U.S. general Nelson A. Miles at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona. Geronimo was a Chiricahua Apache who had led raids on white settlers for ten years after the U.S. government attempted to move the Apache to a reservation.\n\n1888 - The name Kodak was registered by George Eastman of Rochester, NY. He patented his roll-film camera: U.S. Patent #388,850.\n\n1904 - The St. Regis Hotel in New York City opened this day. It was the first hotel to have individual air conditioning and heating in every room. Colonel John Jacob Astor IV also introduced other âmodernâ conveniences at the St. Regis: telephones in every room, a fire alarm system, mail chutes on each floor, and one of the first central vacuum systems -- all the maids had to do was plug their vacuum cleanerâs hose into sockets situated throughout the hotel.\n\n1927 - Lloyd Waner of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a short fly ball that hit inside the foul line and bounced into the stands. It was a home run, according to the rules at the time. Ironically, Wanerâs brother, Paul, came to bat next and did the same thing -- for another home run. Today, a similar hit would be called a ground rule double. (Lloyd and Paul are both in the Baseball Hall of Fame.)\n\n1928 - An endurance test got underway for the Boston Braves. The team started a stretch that saw them playing nine doubleheaders in a row. It is doubtful that the person in charge of scheduling games lasted very long after that.\n\n1928 - Wingy Manone recorded Downright Disgusted for Vocalion Records. Playing drums for Wingy was a young sideman named Gene Krupa.\n\n1941 - The New York Yankees won their 12th American League baseball pennant. This was the earliest any American League team had clinched the title.\n\n1945 - The American flag was raised on Wake Island after surrender ceremonies there. The Japanese garrison consisted of 1,200 men, all of whom returned to Japan in November 1945. During the Japanese occupation of Wake Island, Japanese casualties were over 2,700 (725 killed in action, 1,000 deaths from sickness or malnutrition, and 1000 sick and wounded who were evacuated during July 1945).\n\n1949 - The longest pro tennis match in history was played. Pancho Gonzales and Ted Schroeder played 67 games in five sets.\n\n1950 - Mort Walkerâs comic strip Beetle Bailey first appeared in a just a few newspapers. The feature was soon bought and syndicated by King Features and is noted as the last strip personally approved by William Randolph Hearst. Beetle debuted as a college cutup, but with the U.S. entry into the Korean conflict, Beetle enlisted in the Army, and the rest is comic-strip history. Beetle Bailey went on to become the third most widely distributed comic strip of all time.\n\n1951 - The first coast-to-coast telecast using coaxial cable was seen by viewers from New York City to San Francisco, CA. What did they see? U.S. President Harry S Truman giving a speech to the nation from the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco.\n\n1953 - The New York Yankees became the first baseball team, and Casey Stengel the first manager, to win five consecutive American League championships.\n\n1954 - The first passage of the fabled Northwest Passage was completed by icebreakers from the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.\n\n1959 - Mack the Knife was banned from radio -- at least from WCBS Radio in New York City. Teenage stabbings in the city had people pretty uptight; therefore, the ban.\n\n1965 - Albert Schweitzer, theologian, philosopher and organist died in Gabon where he had set up a hospital in 1913. Acclaimed for his interpretations of J.S. Bachâs works, he also won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts on behalf of the âBrotherhood of Nationsâ in 1952.\n\n1965 - The Beatlesâ Help! hit #1. It remained the supreme song in the U.S. for three weeks.\n\n1971 - An Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 jet crashed into Chilkoot Mountain near Juneau, Alaska. 111 people were killed.\n\n1972 - Swimmer Mark Spitz captured his seventh Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter medley relay event at Munich, Germany. Spitz became the first Olympian to win seven gold medals.\n\n1973 - William E. Colby, became the tenth director of the CIA. He was sworn in at a ceremony presided over by U.S. President Richard M. Nixon.\n\n1982 - After six weeks, Eye of the Tiger, by Survivor, dropped out of the top spot on the music charts. The song, from the movie, Rocky III, dropped all the way to number 2 (for two weeks), then to number 3 for one week and to number 4 for two weeks before starting to fade. Thatâs what we call a hit, folks! It was the groupâs biggest, earning them a platinum record.\n\n1984 - Canadaâs Progressive Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, won a landslide victory in general elections over the Liberal Party of Prime Minister John N. Turner.\n\n1989 - The U.S. Air Force launched its last Titan 3 rocket (carrying a military reconnaissance satellite). Between 1964 and 1989, the Titan 3 had boosted more than 200 satellites into space.\n\n1993 - HervÃ© Villechaize died in Los Angeles after shooting himself. Villechaize is best remembered for playing the character named Tattoo on ABCâs Fantasy Island.\n\n1993 - The New York Yankeesâ Jim Abbott (born without a right hand) pitched a no-hitter on this day. The Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians, 4-0.\n\n1995 - Senator Bob Dole, a Republican presidential hopeful, called for English to be declared the official language of the United States.\n\n1996 - The Smashing Pumpkins rock group won seven MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video for Tonight, Tonight and Best Alternative Music Video for 1979.\n\n1997 - The 14th MTV Video Music Awards show was staged at Radio City Music Hall. Host Chris Rock introduced Madonna, U2, Beck, Jamiroquai, The Wallflowers with Bruce Springsteen & Marilyn Manson. Most memorabel moment: Sting joining Puff Daddy & Faith Evans to perform Iâll Be Missing You.\n\n1998 - Knock Off, with Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Michael Fitzgerlad Wong, Carmen Lee, Glen Chin, Jeff Wolfe and Paul Sorvino, opened in U.S. theatres. Set at the time of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong by the British to the Chinese, itâs about an attempt by the Russian Mafia to sell deadly microbombs. You probably didnât see it in a U.S. theatre, but it has been on U.S. TV a bunch of times.\n\n2000 - The annual Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon raised a record $54,610,289.\n\n2000 - French investigators announced that a stray piece of metal had led to the fatal crash of the supersonic Concorde the previous July. The French theorized that the metal strip had slashed a tire on the Concorde, sending pieces of debris flying up and into the fuel tank of the jetliner, setting of the fatal fire which caused the plane to crash.\n\n2001 - A fire destroyed virtually all of the merchandise and most of the infrastructure of the permanent home of the Straw Market on Nassauâs Bay Street.\n\n2002 - The Oakland Athletics won their AL-record 20th straight game.

Irwinâs Crocodile Hunter show, in which he appeared in his trademark khaki shorts and shirt, debuted in 1992 and was shown around the world on the Discovery cable network.\n\n2007 - A Eurostar train took some 30 minutes off the record for quickest rail journey between Paris and London. Using a new high-speed track, the train covered the the 306-mile (492-kilometer) journey from the Gare du Nord in Paris to Saint Pancras in just two hours, three minutes and 39 seconds from station to station.\n\n2008 - John McCain claimed the GOP presidential nomination at the Republican convention in St. Paul, MN.
