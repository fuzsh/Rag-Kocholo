        "text": "Jamie Angeli begins his sixth season on the UCLA basketball staff. Along with assisting in the day-to-day operations of the UCLA basketball program, Angeli also serves as Steve Lavin’s administrative assistant. Among his numerous responsibilities are assisting the coaching staff in the coordination of all recruiting efforts, video editing and production, computer technology and design, database management and correspondence, alumni and booster relations and game bench duties as assigned by the head coach.\n\nAngeli joined the Bruins in an administrative capacity after serving seven years as a Div. I and Div. II collegiate assistant, in addition to four years as a high school head boy’s basketball coach. Prior to joining UCLA, Angeli was the head coach at Norway High School in Norway, MI. In just three seasons, Angeli became one of the most successful coaches in the school’s history. During his final campaign as head coach, his team won the school’s first district championship in almost twenty years.\n\nA former Michigan All-State high school basketball player, Angeli continued his playing career at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. He graduated from Wisconsin-Stout in 1985. Angeli began his coaching career during the 1986-87 season as the head boys’ basketball coach at Kingsford, MI High School. Since that time, Angeli has made collegiate assistant coaching stops at Michigan Tech University in Houghton (1987-88), Bradley University in Peoria, IL (1988-89), Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, OH (1989-91) and Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, MI (1991-94).\n\nAngeli has had several articles published and a video produced on basketball. Most recently, his “Pass Option Offensive Attack System” and “Build a Better Player - Summer Camp Workout” are currently best-sellers. In 1989 his “Zone Offensive Attack” was published in the NABC Journal and Scholastic Coach Magazine.\n\nDuring the summer months, he directs “Jamie Angeli’s Basketball Camp of Champs” for boys and girls in the upper peninsula of Michigan and northeast Wisconsin. Angeli just concluded his 18th summer as founder and director of this popular camp that has instructed and developed more than 10,000 campers during that span.\n\nOn July 5, 2002, Angeli married Christy Ann Tomlinson of Saugatuck, MI. He is the father of twin eight-year old boys, Riley and Steven and has an 11-year old stepson, Joshua Tomlinson.\n\nAngeli, 40, is the son of Alfred and the late Audrey Angeli of Iron River, MI.\n\nAngeli was born on Jan. 2, 1962."
