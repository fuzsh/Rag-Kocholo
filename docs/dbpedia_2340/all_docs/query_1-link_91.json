        "text": "’51\n\nAlec Voight of Milford, Conn., writes: “I had my 92nd birthday this July and am very grateful for continued good health. I have to watch my steps but am still active with my love of boating and gardening. I was part of the first wave of veterans to attend University. The school, student body and the frats have changed since we became part of fraternity life (Sigma Chi). I met my life’s partner, Pat Joslin ‘54, and had many wonderful friendships from Sigma Chi that followed me down life’s path to this day. All these events have captured a lifetime of memories that I carry with me to this day. I am very proud to be part of the legacy of URI.”\n\n’55\n\nStuart C. Fitelson of Seattle, Wash., who is known as Seattle Stu and is a self-described “freak of nature” due to his long-term athletic performances, writes: “Check seattlestu.com. On November 17, 2015, I will be playing four sports in younger leagues.” His website says that he has been playing league baseball, hockey, and basketball on senior championship teams in Seattle for the past 17 years. He is also an active tennis player and track competitor and wins medals in the NW Senior Games.\n\n’64\n\nColonel Richard Ferro and his wife Cecelia (Amman) Ferro ’66 of Newport, R.I., write: “Now living in Newport, where we plan to stay after years of Air Force and beyond moves here and there. Enjoying many URI events, in particular football and basketball. Recently met several TKE fraternity members for dinner in Narragansett. It’s great to be close enough to recapture so many fond memories.”\n\nEmma Packer Conroy and John Conroy of Memphis, Tenn., recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a party for around 100 friends and family. John is retired, the couple reports, and they are living in Memphis and enjoying life with their grandchildren.\n\n’67\n\nBob Perlow of Narragansett, R.I., presented “Tales from Hollywood” at the Courthouse Center for the Arts in South Kingstown.

Dooley welcomed ROTC graduates General Leon LaPorte, COL John Petrella, COL Milt McKenna, and COL Bill Babcock at the military appreciation football game on Saturday, September 19, 2015.\n\n’70\n\nRobert Warren Blazer writes: “I wrote a book about discoveries I made about human beings and their relationship to life. It was published in 2014. It is called Our World Market. It is a breakthrough in our understanding of how we are naturally designed to contribute to each other. My company, which I founded 38 years ago, is called Dekalb Farmers Market. It is based in the Atlanta area. It is the highest volume, highest quality, highest rated, multicultural fresh food market in this country. The book has a website, www.ourworldmarket.com. After graduating Mechanical Engineering at URI, I was accepted at the Wharton School for an MBA degree. This is the result of “ thinking big” and not giving up on the dream for life to work for us the way our hearts would have it.\n\n’72\n\nDouglas Schram of Newark, Ohio, writes that after obtaining his doctorate at Kansas City College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1976, he spent 37 years devoted to both emergency medicine and family practice. “I have retired from active practice,” he writes, “and devote many hours to helping those with special needs. Rebecca and I travel frequently to visit the boys; one a family physician, the other a professional athlete. I remain attached to the many fine memories I have as an undergraduate at this fine university!”\n\n’74\n\nEdward Balkovic, Ph.D., of Milford, Mass., has been elected to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) of the Parenteral Drug Association.

The first book won the national Indie Award for Excellence in children’s books. The second one that I illustrated just won the gold national Mom’s Choice Book Award! (It is very unusual to win two national awards for my first two books.) I have (very) recently started my own micro-publishing house, Corn Crib Publishing (to gain more control of the finished look). I have successfully published the hardcover version of my first book, A Micro-Chip On My Shoulder, and the e-book of it. I am currently working on illustrating and publishing my third book, A Farmer’s Alphabet, as a softcover, hardcover, and e-book. On another topic, a filmmaker recently made a full-length documentary film about our organic sustainable farm called The Dinner. I know sustainable farming is a big interest for this current generation. My husband says we are so out of fashion, we are back in fashion!”\n\nMartha W.

The novel is not a war story. It is a love story in the time of war. It is the tale of the developing romance between Cheryl Flynn, assistant chief of intelligence for DAO in Vietnam, and Billy Dobson, manager of flight operations for Air America. The story opens with Cheryl boarding the first flight of Gerry Ford’s Operation Babylift out of Saigon on April 4, 1975. The plane crashed 13 miles south of Saigon. Does Cheryl survive? Does anyone survive?”\n\n’82\n\nTerri Maxwell of New Hope, Pa., is scheduled to present at several leading industry events this fall in Louisiana, Ohio, and California.
