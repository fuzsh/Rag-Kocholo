        "text": "2013-14 Creighton Men's Basketball\n\nGame #23 • #12 Creighton at St. John's • Sunday, Feb. 9, 2014 • 6:02 pm CST\n\n#12/12 Creighton Bluejays at St. John's Red Storm\n\nMadison Square Garden (19,979) • New York, N.Y.\n\nRadio: KOZN 1620 AM, www.1620thezone.com\n\nTV: FOX Sports 1\n\nSeries History: St. John's leads, 5-3\n\nLast Meeting: Creighton 63, St. John's 60 on Jan. 28, 2014 in Omaha, Neb.\n\nNext Game\n\nNo. 12/12 Creighton (19-3, 9-1 BIG EAST) has five road games amongst its next seven contests, beginning with Sunday night's contest at St. John's (14-9, 4-6 BIG EAST).\n\nTip-off at Madison Square Garden (19,979) in New York, N.Y., is scheduled for 6:02 pm CST.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKOZN (1620 The Zone) will broadcast all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2013-14 season.

Creighton has won 14 of its last 15 games since December 2nd, including consecutive triumphs over Villanova, Georgetown, St. John's and DePaul.\n\nSix-time BIG EAST Player of the Week Doug McDermott (25.3 ppg., 7.2 rpg., 42.6 3FG%) is the nation's only returning consensus First Team All-American, as well as the nation's leading returning scorer. He's led the Jays in scoring and rebounding each of the past three seasons, was named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year, has scored 19 or more points in all but two games this year, and owns eight games of 30 or more points.\n\nAustin Chatman (7.4 ppg., 3.9 rpg., 4.3 apg.) and Jahenns Manigat (8.2 ppg., 44.6 3FG%) help man the Bluejay backcourt and have combined for 165 assists against just 57 turnovers this year. Avery Dingman (3.3 ppg.) also sees time in the backcourt, starting the last seven games after Grant Gibbs (6.1 ppg., 4.4 apg.) suffered a dislocated kneecap on Jan. 7 at DePaul. Gibbs returned to the line-up on Friday vs. DePaul and had eight assists, seven points and five rebounds.\n\nHelping to replace Gregory Echenique at the “5” spot have been the duo of Ethan Wragge (11.9 ppg., 50.0 3FG%) and Will Artino (6.4 ppg., 66.7 FG%). Wragge ranks in the top-four nationally in three-point percentage and three-pointers made per game.\n\nScouting St. John's\n\nSt. John's is 14-9 on the season and has won five of its last six games. The only loss in that time was a 63-60 setback at Creighton, a result the Red Storm will try to avenge on Sunday.\n\nD'Angelo Harrison leads the Red Storm in scoring (18.3 ppg.), three-pointers (46) and free throws (126), while JaKarr Sampson tops the club with 6.3 rebounds per game and is second with 12.7 points per contest.\n\nChris Obekpa scores a mere 3.7 points per game, but is fourth in the country with 3.5 blocked shots per game after finishing second with 4.0 swats a contest a season ago. He had a career-high 11 points against Creighton two weeks ago.\n\nAs a team, St. John's scores 73.2 points per game while yielding just 67.2. The Red Storm are -0.4 on the glass, turn the ball over just 10.3 times per game, and shoot 71.6 percent at the line.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in the midst of his fourth season as head coach at Creighton. He led CU to a 28-8 mark last year, and is now 99-33 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 379-228 in his 20th season and is 248-164 in his 13th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Patrick Sellers.\n\nSteve Lavin (Chapman, 1988) owns a 54-37 mark in his fourth year at St. John's, moving his career mark to 199-115 in 11 overall years as a head coach. He was previously head coach for seven seasons at UCLA, where he led the Bruins to five Sweet 16's. He is assisted by Rico Hines, Tony Chiles and Jim Whitesell.\n\nThe Series With St. John's\n\nSt. John's leads the all-time series with Creighton by a 5-3 count, including a 4-0 mark in New York.\n\nThe Bluejays won a 63-60 contest in Omaha on January 28th in the first meeting between the schools since 1971.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-0 against St. John's and Steve Lavin, while Lavin is 0-1 versus Creighton.\n\nMilestone Watch\n\n-A win would be Creighton's 100th in the last four years, most in school history for any four-year span. The current 99 wins in the last four years is tied with the 1999-2003 senior class headlined by Kyle Korver.\n\n-A win would also mark Greg McDermott's 100th at Creighton.\n\n-Doug McDermott is 28 points shy of tying Allan Houston (2,801) for 16th in NCAA history.\n\n-Doug McDermott is three rebounds shy of moving into third place in Creighton history in that category, passing Benoit Benjamin (1,005).\n\n-With 30 or more points on Sunday, Doug McDermott can become the first Bluejay with three straight games of 30 or more points since Benoit Benjamin in 1985.\n\n-Grant Gibbs is three assists shy of moving into fourth-place in Creighton history, passing Randy Eccker (458).\n\n-Jahenns Manigat is one made free throw shy of 100 and five rebounds shy of 300.\n\nA Little Garden Variety\n\nSunday's trip to Madison Square Garden will be Creighton's first trek to the venue as it currently stands.\n\nCU's last game on record at a “Madison Square Garden” was a February, 1964 visit to play New York University. That game, as well as several others before that (such as the 1942 NIT), took place in the third variation of Madison Square Garden. That facility was demolished in 1968.\n\nThe current Madison Square Garden (MSG IV) facility opened in 1967, with its first basketball game contested in 1968.\n\nCreighton's only current student-athlete to play in a college game at The Garden is Grant Gibbs (in 2008-09 at Gonzaga).\n\nNotably, Greg McDermott, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge all told the media after Friday's game that they've never visited the World's Most Famous Arena.\n\nFamous Moment, Famous Coach\n\nMadison Square Garden is often referred to as the “World's Most Famous Arena”, and a former Creighton coach is involved in what a 2013 Bleacher Report poll named the greatest moment in Madison Square Garden history.\n\nAfter missing Game 6 with a severe thigh injury, NBA MVP Willis Reed limped out of the tunnel prior to Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to raucous applause. He would start and make the New York Knicks' first two baskets. Though he wouldn't score again, the tone was set and he was named Finals MVP.\n\nReed would later serve as head coach at Creighton from 1981-85, winning 52 games.\n\nBig Stage\n\nDoug McDermott is one of the frontrunners for the Wooden Award, which led us to look back at how the last 20 Wooden Award winners did in their first game of their award-winning season at Madison Square Garden, if they visited the World's Most Famous Arena.\n\nYr.

As seen in the list below, McDermott is one of 10 men in NCAA history to score at least 2,700 career points and make more than 50 percent of his shots from the field. On that list, only Danny Manning, Hank Gathers and Otis Birdsong have shot more accurately than McDermott from the field.\n\n2,700 Points & 50% FG, All-Time\n\n(Sorted by FG%)\n\nRk.

He ranks fourth on the team in scoring (8.0), third in rebounding (4.0) and fourth with 60 assists.\n\nBrooks is the rare Creighton Bluejay that comes from New York, hailing from Harlem.\n\nHe is Creighton's first player from the Empire State since Buffalo native Dominic Bishop (2005-06).\n\nBrooks missed Friday night's game vs. DePaul due to illness.\n\nFather/Son Duos\n\nAccording to the website CollegeHoopedia.com, Doug McDermott is just the sixth man in NCAA history to be named conference player of the year while playing for his father.\n\nJoining them on that elite list are Dick/Mark Acres (Oral Roberts), Dick/Tony Bennett (UW Green Bay), Homer/Bryce Drew (Valparaiso), Press/Pete Maravich (LSU) and Clifford/C.J. Reed (Bethune-Cookman).\n\nBelow is a list compiled by ESPN.com of most points scored by a guy playing for his dad:\n\nName, School Points Father\n\nPete Maravich,LSU 3,667 Press\n\nAllan Houston, Tennessee 2,801 Wade\n\nDoug McDermott, Creighton 2,773 Greg\n\nTony Bennett, UWGB 2,285 Dick\n\nBryce Drew, Valparaiso 2,142 Homer\n\nTurning 30\n\nDoug McDermott had a season-best 39 points when Creighton beat St. John's less than two weeks ago in Omaha.\n\nThe last Creighton player with multiple games of 30+ points against the same opposition in the same season was Benoit Benjamin, who did it agianst Indiana State in 1984-85.\n\nBlock Party?\n\nSunday's match-up will feature two teams that use vastly different methods to hold the opposition to 40 percent shooting from the field.\n\nSt. John's ranks first nationally with 8.3 blocked shots per game, including 3.5 per game from Chris Obekpa.\n\nCreighton, on the other hand, ranks 341st nationally with just 1.5 swats per game as a team. The Bluejays have a season-high of five rejections (vs. UMKC, 11/11) and have played five straight games without a block. The Bluejays haven't had more than eight blocks in a game since Jan. 3, 2010, a span of 152 games.\n\nCreighton does not have a player with more than seven blocks all season, while the Red Storm own six different men with at least seven blocked shots.\n\nOffensive Differences, Too\n\nJust as the teams play different defensive styles, the same can also be said on the other end of the floor.\n\nCreighton leads the nation with 18.4 assists per game and a 1.82 assist/turnover ratio. The Bluejays have four men with 60 assists or more, and the team has an assist on 65.6 percent of its field goals.\n\nSt. John's averages 12.8 assists per game and a 1.24 assist/turnover ratio while assisting on 48.5 percent of its baskets. No Red Storm player owns more than 65 assists this campaign.\n\n30 x 3?\n\nSince 1990, only two Creighton players have scored 30 points in consecutive games; Bob Harstad in 1990 and Doug McDermott on three occasions last season and once this year.\n\nMcDermott, who is coming off a 39-point game on Jan. 28 vs. St. John's and 32 more on Friday vs. DePaul, can become the first Bluejay since Benoit Benjamin (Jan. 17-23, 1985) with three straight games of 30 or more points.\n\nMcDermott Rains 39 on Red Storm\n\nDoug McDermott had 39 points in the Jan. 28 win over St. John's.\n\nIt was the most points scored against St. John's by a BIG EAST player since Allen Iverson had 39 in 1996, and fourth-most ever by a league opponent.\n\nMcDermott is only the fourth BIG EAST player to ever score 39 or more against the Red Storm, joining Donyell Marshall (42 in 1994), Terry Dehere (41 in 1993) and Iverson (39 in 1996). Marshall, Dehere and Iverson would all end up being first or second team All-Americans.\n\nMcDermott's 39 points were the most by any player in the BIG EAST this season, and most since Villanova's Maalik Wayans had 39 at Cincinnati on Jan. 14, 2012.\n\nMcDermott's 39 points are tied for 14th-most in Creighton history for a single game.\n\nMcDermott's 39 points tied the third-highest effort of his career, and were five shy of his career high 44. McDermott and Bob Portman are the only players in CU history with four or more games of 39+ points.\n\nFor his performance, McDermott was named BIG EAST Player of the Week for the sixth time as well as ESPN.com National Player of the Week.\n\nRoad Success\n\nCreighton is 22-9 in true road games the past three years, and 34-12 when you also include neutral site games.\n\nThis year's team is 5-1 in true road games and 1-2 at neutral sites. Each of Creighton's last 10 NCAA Tournament qualifiers have had 10 or more road/neutral wins.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nDoug McDermott hit a game-winning three-pointer with 2.8 seconds left to beat St. John's in Creighton's home game on Jan. 28th.\n\nIt was Creighton's first go-ahead score in the last 10 seconds of a home game since Antoine Young's bucket with 0.3 seconds in 2012 vs. Long Beach State left made him the first player in CenturyLink Center Omaha history with two game-winning scores at the facility.\n\nCreighton is now 7-2 in games with a go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds in the 11-year old facility.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n01/28/14 St. John's W 63-60 McDermott 3FG :2.8\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.) 53-52 G.

In the last 20 years, it was just the fifth time that a Bluejay had scored 50 percent or more of his team's points.\n\nThe 61.9 percent of CU's points was the most by any player in those 20 years.\n\n50% Or More of Creighton's Points,\n\nGames Since 1993-94\n\nCU\n\nPts.

The Jays then climbed to 20th the week of Nov. 25th.\n\nThe Jays dropped out of the poll for six weeks before returning on Jan. 13th with a No. 20 ranking. After one week out of the poll, CU was 20th last week before skyrocketing to a season-best 12th in this week's edition, the program's best mark since last year's team was also 12th in the January 14, 2013 poll.\n\nCreighton is 76-27 all-time when ranked in the AP poll.\n\nIncluding the February 3rd poll result, Creighton has been ranked 33 times in 71 weeks of AP polls under Greg McDermott, and ranked between 26th-to-28th in nine other AP polls. The 33 weeks in the top-25 under McDermott is more than any coach in Bluejay history.\n\nIn the February 3rd USA Today Coaches poll, Creighton was ranked 12th, and the Jays are also 10th in this week's NCAA RPI ranking.\n\nMost Weeks in AP Top 25 at CU, By Coach\n\nGreg McDermott, 2010-Pres. 33 (of 71)\n\nDana Altman, 1994-2010 18\n\nTom Apke, 1974-81 5\n\nEddie Sutton, 1969-74 5\n\nWinning As A Team\n\nCreighton has been anything but a one-man team of late, placing five men in double-figures during wins over DePaul, Xavier and Georgetown in the last eight games alone.\n\nNot only did five men reach double-digits on Jan. 25 vs. Georgetown, but Austin Chatman's nine points nearly gave the Bluejays six double-figure scorers for the first time since Feb. 1, 2012.\n\nOver .500, Again\n\nCreighton has been better than .500 in either the first or second-half of its league season in 36 straight trips through the league, including this year's first half.\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC/BIG EAST season since 1995-96.\n\nYear 1st Half 2nd Half\n\n2013-14 8-1 1-0 so far\n\n2012-13 7-2 6-3\n\n2011-12 8-1 6-3\n\n2010-11 5-4 5-4\n\n2009-10 5-4 5-4\n\n2008-09 5-4 9-0\n\n2007-08 5-4 5-4\n\n2006-07 6-3 7-2\n\n2005-06 7-2 5-4\n\n2004-05 5-4 6-3\n\n2003-04 7-2 5-4\n\n2002-03 8-1 7-2\n\n2001-02 8-1 6-3\n\n2000-01 5-4 9-0\n\n1999-00 5-4 6-3\n\n1998-99 6-3 5-4\n\n1997-98 5-4 7-2\n\n1996-97 5-4 5-4\n\n1995-96 4-5 5-4\n\nTotal 114-57 (.667) 110-53 (.675)\n\nWragge Earns League & National Honor\n\nSenior forward Ethan Wragge was named BIG EAST Player of the Week and ESPN.com's National Player of the Week on Jan. 27 after helping Creighton to double-digit wins over No. 4 Villanova and Georgetown and averaging 19.5 points and 3.5 rebounds.\n\nHe shot a blistering 60 percent from the field (12-20), with all 20 attempts coming from behind the three-point line, and was also perfect in three attempts from the charity stripe.\n\nWragge opened his week with one of the best shooting displays in Creighton history while scoring a career-high 27 points. He made 9-of-14 three-point shots, tying a single-game mark first set by Kyle Korver, while adding three rebounds and three assists. Wragge made each of his first seven three-point attempts, including one in each of the game's first seven minutes, as the Bluejays surged to a 27-8 lead against one of the nation's top defenses.\n\nWragge's eighth trey of the first half stopped a 13-0 run that had drawn 'Nova within 15 points, and he would tie the school mark with 14:02 left in the game.\n\nThe win was Creighton's first over a ranked team in a true road game since 1978, and matched the highest-ranked club that the Jays have ever beaten.\n\nIn the Jan. 25 win over Georgetown, Wragge had 12 points and four rebounds in a 13-point victory. After Creighton fell behind 11-7 early, Wragge scored all his points during a pivotal 15-4 run in a five-minute stretch that gave CU the lead for good. His second trifecta of the day made history as he joined Korver as the second player in Creighton history with 300 or more three-pointers.\n\nRed Hot Wragge\n\nEthan Wragge has made a three-point basket in all 22 games he's played this season. Wragge's streak is the fifth-longest in Creighton history, and just nine behind the school record set by Booker Woodfox in 2008-09.\n\nWragge also had a 21-game streak to end his freshman season before it was snapped during his first appearance of 2010-11.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kyle Korver's second-place streak of 28 games with a trey was snapped when he did not attempt a field goal in 24 minutes of play during an 83-56 win over UNI on Feb. 9, 2002. Korver then drained a triple in 27 more games in a row, a stretch from Feb. 13, 2002 to Jan. 20, 2003.\n\nConsecutive Games With a 3FG, CU History\n\nStreak Name Dates\n\n31 Booker Woodfox 11/25/08 to 3/23/09\n\n28 Kyle Korver 2/4/01 to 2/6/02\n\n27 Kyle Korver 2/13/02 to 1/20/03\n\n25 Rodney Buford 1/25/97 to 1/10/98\n\n22 Ethan Wragge 11/08/13 to Present\n\n21 Ethan Wragge 1/3/10 to 3/24/10\n\n20 Johnny Mathies 12/22/04 to 2/28/05\n\nWhat's Your 20?\n\nCreighton has been .500 or better after 20 games in each of the last 19 seasons, including this season.\n\nEven more impressive, Creighton has won 13 of its first 20 games in 16 of the last 17 seasons, and begun 17-3 or better five times in the past 12 years..\n\nCreighton -- First 20 Games, Last 19 Years\n\nYear First 20 W-L Final W-L Postseason\n\n2013-14 17-3 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n2012-13 17-3 28-8 NCAA\n\n2011-12 18-2 29-6 NCAA\n\n2010-11 13-7 23-16 CBI\n\n2009-10 10-10 18-16 CIT\n\n2008-09 15-5 27-8 NIT\n\n2007-08 14-6 22-11 NIT\n\n2006-07 13-7 22-11 NCAA\n\n2005-06 15-5 20-10 NIT\n\n2004-05 13-7 23-11 NCAA\n\n2003-04 17-3 20-9 NIT\n\n2002-03 18-2 29-5 NCAA\n\n2001-02 14-6 23-9 NCAA\n\n2000-01 14-6 24-8 NCAA\n\n1999-00 14-6 23-10 NCAA\n\n1998-99 14-6 22-9 NCAA\n\n1997-98 14-6 18-10 NIT\n\n1996-97 10-10 15-15 ---\n\n1995-96 11-9 14-15 ---\n\nOver 500 Points, Again\n\nDoug McDermott is fifth in the nation with 557 points this season, his fourth straight season of 500 or more points.\n\nMcDermott is the only player in Creighton history to score 500 or more in four straight seasons, one more than the three times done by Paul Silas (1961-64), Bob Harstad (1988-91) and Rodney Buford (1996-99).\n\nSince 1997-98, the only four other players nationwide to post four seasons of 550 or more points are Keydren Clark and Tyler Hansbrough.\n\nMcDermott has scored in double-figures in 122 of 132 career games, including 90-of-93 contests since the start of his sophomore season.\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nCreighton is 61-7 (.897) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, improving to 158-25 (.863) all-time in the 11-year-old facility.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 177-25 (.876) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nDoug McDermott is averaging 27.6 points per game at home this season in just 32.3 minutes per game. He's scored 15.8 points per game in the first half at home this season, and reached double-figures before half in all but one contest.\n\nEach of Ethan Wragge's last 57 field goals at home have been three-pointers. He last made a two-pointer at home on Jan. 8, 2013 vs. Drake.\n\nPoint, Counterpoint\n\nAustin Chatman owns 311 career assists in his first 93 career games. With seven helpers on Jan. 25th vs. Georgetown, Chatman became the 13th player in Bluejay history to 300 assists.\n\nHe is seventh on the list of fewest games played to reach 300 dimes.\n\nCreighton's Quickest Players to 300 Assists\n\nGames Name\n\n53 Ralph Bobik\n\n56 Grant Gibbs\n\n59 Randy Eccker\n\n69 Ryan Sears\n\n85 Tyler McKinney\n\n89 Duan Cole\n\n91 Austin Chatman\n\n92 Vernon Moore\n\n94 Josh Dotzler\n\n100 Antoine Young\n\n102 Kevin McKenna\n\n110 Latrell Wrightsell\n\n129 Nate Funk\n\nBig Margins vs. Top 5\n\nAccording to ESPN.com, Creighton's 96-68 win over No. 4 Villanova on Jan. 20 was a victory for the ages.\n\nThe chart below signifies the largest margin of victory by an unranked team over a top-five team in the last 20 seasons.\n\nYear Winner Upset Victim Won By\n\n2011-12 Florida State #3 North Carolina 33\n\n2008-09 Notre Dame #5 Louisville 33\n\n2013-14 Creighton #4 Villanova 28\n\n21 Three-Pointers Sets Records\n\nCreighton set a BIG EAST and school-record with 21 three-point baskets on Jan. 20 in a 28-point win at No. 4 Villanova.\n\nCreighton's previous mark was 20, done vs. Chattanooga in 2005.\n\nThe previous BIG EAST mark was 20, done by Notre Dame vs. Villanova in 2011 and by West Virginia vs. Marquette in 2006.\n\nThe 21 three-pointers were the most by any college team since 2010, and according to Athlon Sports, the most in a game between major conference teams since Kentucky made 21 vs. North Carolina on Dec. 27, 1989.\n\nCreighton's 35 three-point attempts tied the school record, done three times previously.\n\nCreighton broke the Wells Fargo Center record for three-pointers by a Villanova opponent late in the first half (the old mark was 12), and also set a mark for most points against 'Nova at the Wells Fargo Center with 96, passing the old mark of 90.\n\nWragge “Balboa”\n\nPlaying in a city where “Rocky” was filmed, Creighton senior Ethan Wragge put one of the most impressive shooting displays in recent college basketball history on Jan. 20th.\n\nWragge shot 7-for-7 from three-point range in the first seven minutes at No. 4 Villanova, and would finish the first half with a career-best 24 points.\n\nHe finished the game with 27 points, and his nine three-pointers tied the previous Creighton record held by Kyle Korver.\n\nWragge's nine trifectas were one shy of the BIG EAST single-game record.\n\nDuring the game, Wragge's name and #WraggeBombs were both trending nationally on Twitter.\n\nIn Creighton's previous trip to Philadelphia on Nov. 16 to play Saint Joseph's, Wragge drained a then-best seven three-pointers and scored 21 points.\n\nManigat Comes Up Big, Too\n\nLost in all the commotion of Ethan Wragge's unreal shooting was the performance by his senior teammate Jahenns Manigat on Jan. 20 at No. 4 Villanova.\n\nManigat had a career-high 19 points, making 6-of-7 shots and 4-of-5 attempts from downtown. He also added five assists and a steal and did not have a turnover in 28 minutes of work.\n\nAustin's Market\n\nAustin Chatman had a season-best 10 assists on Jan. 20th in the win at Villanova. The 10 helpers contributed to 29 points by his Bluejay teammates, nine three-pointers and a lay-up.\n\nChatman's seven assists on Jan. 25th vs. Georgetown led to 18 Bluejay points.\n\nTop 25 Win, And More\n\nCreighton's 96-68 win over No. 4 Villanova on Jan. 20 rewrote the record book in numerous ways. Consider...\n\n-The win over the No. 4 team matched the highest ranked team CU has ever beaten, previously No. 4 Arizona State on Dec. 13, 1963.\n\n-Creighton had lost 22 straight games against top-10 teams dating to 1974.\n\n-Creighton had lost 11 straight games against ranked teams since 2007.\n\n-Creighton had lost 25 straight true road games against ranked teams since a 1978 win over a Larry Bird-led Indiana State team.\n\n-Creighton improved to 19-118 all-time against ranked teams.\n\n-It was Creighton's first win over a top-five team since Jan. 29, 1970. Creighton had been 2-25 all-time against top-five foes.\n\n-It was the highest-ranked team ever beaten by Greg McDermott, who improved to 8-25 all-time as a Division I head coach vs. ranked foes (1-3 at CU).\n\n-It was Creighton's largest margin of victory in 137 games against a ranked team. The previous high was 12, done in a 53-41 win vs. No. 17 Illinois State in 1983.\n\nFun Facts\n\nEven more fun facts following Creighton's Jan. 20 win vs. Villanova.\n\n-The victory made Creighton the nation's only team with five true road wins and a top-25 strength of schedule, per WarrenNolan.com, at the time.\n\n-The 28-point loss was Villanova's largest in 13 years under Jay Wright, the largest by 'Nova since 2000-01 (93-65 at UCLA), and largest at home since the 1980-81 season when it lost to Notre Dame by a 94-65 count.\n\n-The 96 points were the most allowed by Villanova since the 2009-10 season, when the Wildcats surrendered 103 points to Georgetown.\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nCreighton made a three-pointer on each of its first nine possessions in its Jan. 20 win at No. 4 Villanova. Creighton started the game 7-for-7 from deep, missed a two-pointer but turned an offensive rebound into another trey, and then sank a trifecta on its ninth trip, as well.\n\nThat brings to mind all sorts of fun stats.\n\n-According to Ken Pomeroy, Creighton became the first team since Indiana State in 2012 to make its first nine attempts from three-point range in a game. Pomeroy found evidence of six teams in the last five years to make their first nine attempts from downtown.\n\n-Pomeroy's research also indicates that Creighton is the only team in the last five years to make nine straight three's without any other scores to start a game.\n\n-Pomeroy also found that Creighton was the second team in five years to score each of its first 30 points via the three-pointer. Miami (Ohio) had its first 33 points vs. Western Michigan on Jan. 28, 2012.\n\n-The Villanova contest marked the eighth time under Greg McDermott that Creighton's made its first five (or more) shots (of any distance).\n\nStart Opponent Date\n\n13-13 Campbell 11/25/11\n\n8-8 Illinois State 2/1/12\n\n8-8 Idaho State 12/18/10\n\n7-7 at #4 Villanova 1/20/14\n\n6-6 Oregon 3/28/11\n\n5-5 Chicago State 12/29/13\n\n5-5 Alcorn State 11/8/13\n\n5-5 UCF 3/23/11\n\n1 If By Land, 2 If By Sea, 3 If By Wragge\n\nEthan Wragge owns 1,051 career points, but just 26 two-point field goals. Only one player since 1997 has scored 1,000 career points with fewer than career 40 two-pointers, Butler's Bruce Horan (2003-06). Horan finished his career with 1,018 career points and just 12 two-pointers, thanks to 314 treys and 52 free throws.\n\nSince 2006-07, Wragge owns the nation's only two seasons with at least 78 three-pointers and six or fewer two-point baskets, having done it last year (78 3's, 6 2's) and this season (81 3's, 2 2's).\n\nWragge's 81 treys this year are more than any other player since 1997-98 in a season with two or fewer two-point field goals. In those seasons, Horan owns the mark for most trifectas with three two-pointers with 113 (and 3 2's) in 2005-06.\n\nAmong active players, the active player with more than 1,000 career points and the second-fewest amount of two-pointers is Harvard's Laurent Rivard (1,159 points; 87 two-pointers).\n\nRacing To 75\n\nEthan Wragge needed just 20 games to reach 75 three-pointers made this season. He was the second-fastest player in program history to reach the milestone, trailing only Kyle Korver (16 games) in 2002-03.\n\nIn Korver's magical 2002-03 season, he would finish with a school-record 129 three-pointers in 34 games, an average of 3.79 treys per game.\n\nBy comparison, Wragge's 81 three-pointers in 22 games this year are a similar 3.68 trifectas per contest.\n\nBelow is a list of the fewest games to 75 three-pointers in program history.\n\nFewest Games Before Making 75th 3-Pointer\n\nName Year Games to 75\n\nKyle Korver 2002-03 16\n\nEthan Wragge 2013-14 20\n\nTad Ackerman 1994-95 25\n\nKyle Korver 2000-01 26\n\nBooker Woodfox 2008-09 27\n\nKyle Korver 2001-02 28\n\nRod Mason 1987-88 32\n\nEthan Wragge 2012-13 35\n\nDoug McDermott 2012-13 35\n\nA KenPom Delight?\n\nNoted statistician Ken Pomeroy's website, KenPom.com has numerous ratings that break down team efficiencies.

It's worth noting that this season Charleston Southern is averaging 10.50 treys per contest this season, as well.\n\nBig Men, Big Promise\n\nCreighton's three top big men off the bench have all shown great promise in limited playing time of late.\n\nWill Artino has averaged 7.7 points and 4.0 rebounds in the last six games.\n\nZach Hanson had 17 points and five rebounds in 19 minutes, while Geoffrey Groselle added 12 points and seven rebounds in 13 minutes.\n\nCombined, the trio shot 33-for-42 from the floor (78.6 percent) and combined for 75 points and 36 rebounds in 112 minutes of work over the last five games.\n\nWhat A Run!\n\nCreighton scored on 14 straight possessions in the first half of its 88-60 rout of Butler on Jan. 14th.

Creighton has now won 10 or more home games in 18 straight seasons.\n\nThe current streak is a school-record, six more than the previous standard of 12 straight seasons from the 1969-70 season to the 1980-81 campaign with 10 or more home wins.\n\nCreighton has won 10 or more home games in 35 of the last 45 seasons.\n\nPlayer of the Week, Again\n\nDoug McDermott was named BIG EAST Player of the Week on Jan. 13th, the fifth time this year he was honored. McDermott averaged 26.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists as Creighton posted wins over DePaul and Xavier\n\nMcDermott was also named National Player of the Week by the USBWA, NBCSports.com and CBS Sports.\n\nMcDermott has been named a league Newcomer or Player of the Week in 26 of 61 weeks since enrolling at Creighton.\n\nDeadly From Downtown\n\nThrough games of February 6th, Creighton was second in the nation with 230 three-point baskets and first with 11.0 three-pointers per game and 43.2 percent marksmanship from deep.\n\nCreighton has made 10 or more three-pointers in all but six games, and seven or more in all but one contest this season.\n\nCreighton also ranked first with 18.3 assists per game and in assist/turnover ratio (1.77), seventh in scoring margin (+15.8), 10th in field goal percentage (.493) and 17th in free-throw percentage (.751).\n\nDoug McDermott ranked second nationally in scoring average, sixth in field goals made and sixth in total points.\n\nEthan Wragge ranked second in three-point percentage, ninth in three-pointers made and fourth in three-pointers per game.\n\nJahenns Manigat ranks seventh nationally with a 3.63 assist/turnover ratio, as well.\n\nMcDermott Among Wooden Award Top 25\n\nSenior Doug McDermott was one of 25 men named to the John R.

His 16 points were the second-most of any game in his 86-game career, while his five rebounds were the third-best game of his career.\n\nIn his second career start, Dingman had a (then) career-best seven rebounds in a career-high 27 minutes. He topped that with nine rebounds in his last outing, vs. St. John's on Jan. 28th.\n\nCreighton is 6-1 this year with Dingman as a starter. In those contests, he has averaged 3.7 points and 4.3 rebounds per contest in that span.\n\nBoard Battle Is Big\n\nOne common theme during Creighton's 10-game winning streak was that the Bluejays had won the rebound battle in nine contests, and lost it by just one in the other.\n\nIn the loss at Providence, Creighton lost the glass battle 33-27, but the margin was double-digits most of the game.\n\nIn 10 BIG EAST contests, the Bluejays have collected 30 more rebounds than the opposition.\n\nDating to last season Creighton has won 21 straight games when winning the battle of the boards, and 80-14 in four years under Greg McDermott when winning the rebound column.\n\nBCS Busters at Home\n\nCreighton has won 21 straight regular-season home games against teams from BCS leagues (at time of game) since the start of the 1996-97 season.\n\nThose 21 wins have been by an average of 11.81 points, with 13 coming by double-digits, and just one decided by fewer than six points.\n\nBCS Schools at Creighton, Last 16 Years*\n\nDate Score\n\n02/07/14 Creighton 78, DePaul 66\n\n01/28/14 Creighton 63, St. John's 60\n\n01/25/14 Creighton 79, Georgetown 66\n\n01/14/14 Creighton 88, Butler 60\n\n01/12/14 Creighton 95, Xavier 89\n\n12/31/13 Creighton 67, Marquette 49\n\n12/22/13 Creighton 68, California 54\n\n12/08/13 Creighton 82, Nebraska 67\n\n12/22/11 Creighton 87, Northwestern 79\n\n12/04/11 Creighton 76, Nebraska 66\n\n12/06/09 Creighton 67, Nebraska 61\n\n11/24/07 Creighton 74, Nebraska 62\n\n11/09/07 Creighton 74, DePaul 62\n\n12/11/05 Creighton 70, Nebraska 44\n\n12/10/03 Creighton 61, Nebraska 54\n\n12/12/01 Creighton 76, Nebraska 70\n\n12/09/99 Creighton 89, Nebraska 72\n\n11/27/99 Creighton 85, #23 Iowa 76\n\n12/20/98 Creighton 66, #18 Oklahoma State 60\n\n12/02/98 Creighton 73, Baylor 59\n\n12/10/97 Creighton 84, Nebraska 73\n\n*regular-season games only\n\nTop Dog At The Halfway Point\n\nTwo-time All-American Doug McDermott is a well-known commodity among the national experts who cover the sport.\n\nWith conference play underway, numerous national publications and websites have named their Midseason Players of the Year.\n\nAmong the following individuals/organizations have named McDermott the front-runner for National Player of the Year were: Jay Bilas (ESPN), Jeff Goodman (ESPN), Andy Katz (ESPN), Jay Williams (ESPN), Dick Vitale (ESPN), Digger Phelps (ESPN), Dan Dakich (ESPN), Gary Parrish (CBS Sports), Jeff Borzello (CBS Sports), Jerry Palm (CBS Sports), Jon Rothstein (CBS Sports), CJ Moore (Bleacher Report), Kelli Anderson (Sports Illustrated), Seth Davis (Sports Illustrated), Luke Winn (Sports Illustrated) and Brian Hamilton (Sports Illustrated).\n\nAssist Machine?\n\nDoug McDermott has 21 assists in Creighton's last nine games, including when he tied a career-high with five helpers at Seton Hall on Jan. 4th.\n\nThe 21 assists have led directly to 56 points by his Bluejay teammates.\n\nLink To Greatness\n\nCreighton's home, CenturyLink Center Omaha, has received several rave reviews in recent weeks.\n\nESPN.com's Jeff Goodman ranked it as the 10th best college basketball arena.\n\nESPN's Dick Vitale listed the facility among six on his “Bucket List”.\n\nStadium Journey, a site that ranks arenas, named it the 18th-best venue in North America, and fourth-best among college basketball sites. Only Allen Fieldhouse (Kansas), Rupp Arena (Kentucky), FedEx Forum (Memphis) were ranked higher.\n\nMcDermott Named Player of the Week\n\nCreighton senior Doug McDermott picked up two more awards on Jan. 6 as he was named National Player of the Week by CBSSports.com in addition to his BIG EAST Conference Player of the Week accolade.\n\nMcDermott averaged 24.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game in double-digit victories over Marquette and Seton Hall.\n\nThis was his fourth BIG EAST Player of the Week accolade this season, and his second National Player of the Week Award (also Nov. 18 from ESPN.com).\n\nIn the write-up on McDermott from CBSSports.com, Gary Parrish writes “McDermott is, quite simply, having one of the greatest college careers in modern history.”\n\nA Wonderful Day\n\nDoug McDermott celebrated his first game since his 22nd birthday with 30 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a 13-point road win at Seton Hall on Jan. 4th.\n\nMcDermott was Creighton's first player with a 30 point, 10 rebound, five assist line in the same game since Benoit Benjamin had 45 points, 16 rebounds and five assists on Jan. 19, 1985 vs. Indiana State.\n\nBall Control Offense\n\nCreighton had just four turnovers in 66 possessions vs. Seton Hall on Jan. 4th, its fewest in any games of Greg McDermott's four-year tenure on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nJust 10 days later, the Bluejays did it again in a victory over Butler.\n\nThe Jays also did it on Feb. 7 vs. St. John's.\n\nCreighton's four turnovers were its fewest since having three miscues on Feb. 1, 2005 in a win vs. Wichita State, a span of 335 games.\n\nStrong Start To League Play\n\nBefore its Jan. 18 loss to Providence, Creighton started 5-0 in league play for the third time in 12 years (also 2002-03 and 2012-13). Since the start of the NIT and NCAA Tournaments, the Bluejays have made the postseason all four times it has opened league play 5-0.\n\nLast season Creighton started Missouri Valley Conference play with a 6-0 mark en route to an eventual regular-season title.\n\nImpressive 125 Game Start\n\nA Jan. 7 win at DePaul marked the 125th game at Creighton for Greg McDermott. During that time, he won 93 games, two MVC Tournament titles, one MVC regular-season title and two NCAA Tournament games while having three of his teams ranks among the top-six nationally in average home attendance.\n\nThe game was also McDermott's 600th career game as a head coach, and made him 373-227.\n\nScoring Early & Often\n\nDoug McDermott has scored in double-figures before the second media timeout in eight of Creighton's last 14 games, and 11 of Creighton's 22 games this season.\n\nIn 22 games this year, McDermott has scored 200 points before checking out for the first time, logging a collective 192:39 of court time before hitting the bench.\n\nThat gives him 1.04 points per minute to start games, good for a 41.53 points per game average if her were to maintain it over the course of 40 minutes.\n\nLooking only at the first five minutes of games this season, McDermott has scored 126 points in those 110 minutes, an average of 1.15 points per minute and a per-40 minute average of 45.8 points per game at that pace.\n\nPlaying With A Lead\n\nIn the 11 year history of CenturyLink Center Omaha, Creighton has led wire-to-wire in 48 games, including all five December home games this season, the Jan. 14 Butler game and the Jan. 28 St. John's game. That means the Jays haven't trailed in seven of the past 10 home contests.\n\nCreighton has trailed for just 23:15 of 520:00 minutes this season at home, and just 27:29 of its last 600:00 minutes during its 15-game home win streak. Impressively, Creighton has not trailed at any point in the second half during that home win streak, winning 14 of the 15 games by six or more points (and all but two by double-digits).\n\nGood As Gold\n\nNot only has Creighton started games quickly this season, but the Bluejays have also done a good job maintaining those leads.\n\nThe Bluejays have won 28 straight games when leading with 5:00 to play.\n\nOverall under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 90-4 when leading with 5:00 left, including victories in 52 of the last 53 scenarios. The Bluejays are also 3-0 under McDermott when tied with 5:00 to play.\n\nCU is 5-29 under McDermott when trailing with 5:00 left, with the last such rally coming on Feb. 25, 2011 at Indiana State.\n\nSeniors Lead The Way\n\nCreighton's senior class has led the way in recent weeks, providing tremendous scoring and shooting in addition to unquestioned leadership.\n\nTake a look at the collective performances of Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge during the club's last 15 games:\n\nOpponent 3FG-3FGA Points Rebounds\n\nLong Beach State 8-16 39 9\n\nNebraska 11-24 67 21\n\nArkansas-Pine Bluff 7-22 47 16\n\nCalifornia 5-18 46 24\n\nChicago State 15-21 60 14\n\nMarquette 11-24 51 21\n\nSeton Hall 9-22 64 27\n\nDePaul 7-14 42 20\n\nXavier 12-24 61 13\n\nButler 5-11 36 14\n\nProvidence 3-13 38 10\n\n#4 Villanova 18-27 69 11\n\nGeorgetown 6-15 36 15\n\nSt. John's 6-12 46 15\n\nDePaul 6-20 51 19\n\n14-Game Totals 129-283 753 249\n\nRest of Team 30-97 442 253\n\nOn A Roll\n\nSince the start of 2011-12, Creighton is a remarkable 76-17. On a national basis, Creighton's 75 wins since the start of last season ranks tied for seventh, through games of Feb. 7, as seen below.\n\nMost Wins, Since 2011-12\n\nSchool '11-12 '12-13 '13-14 W-L Next\n\nSyracuse 34-3 30-10 22-0 85-13 2/9\n\nLouisville 30-10 35-5 19-4 84-19 2/13\n\nWichita State 27-6 30-9 24-0 80-16 2/8\n\nKansas 32-7 31-6 17-5 80-18 2/8\n\nGonzaga 26-7 32-3 21-3 79-13 2/8\n\nOhio State 31-8 29-8 18-5 78-21 2/8\n\nCreighton 29-6 28-8 19-3 76-17 2/9\n\nKentucky 38-2 21-12 17-5 76-19 2/8\n\nMichigan State 29-8 27-9 20-3 76-20 2/9\n\nGive Me Five\n\nCreighton's win vs. Chicago State on Dec. 29th was the Jays fifth straight this season, a streak that reached 10 after a Jan. 14 win vs. Butler. The Bluejays have now had at least one five-game win streak in 16 of the last 17 seasons.\n\nSince 1988-89, the Bluejays have made the NCAA's, NIT or CBI all 18 previous times they've had a five-game winning streak in a season, but missed the NCAA/NIT/CBI all seven times they haven't.\n\nBCS Busters\n\nOne frequent question about how Creighton will handle the move to the BIG EAST is how they'll handle the nightly rigors of playing against “BCS” competition on a regular basis.\n\nIn the past three seasons, Creighton is 21-3 against teams from those leagues, with two losses (North Carolina, Duke) coming in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament, and another at Providence. Sixteen of the 21 wins came by double-digits, and just 10 of the games took place in Omaha.\n\nIndividually, Doug McDermott has scored at least 19 points in all but two of those games (Alabama & Georgetown), and in both of those he had a double-double. McDermott has averaged 23.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the 24 games.\n\nD.

To earn the same point total (48 points) from 25 two-point attempts, Creighton would need to shoot 24-for-25 (96 percent).\n\nPerhaps that's why Greg McDermott said in the postgame press conference: “If you're going to give us an open 3-point shot, that's the best percentage shot we can get.”\n\nChicago State head coach Tracy Dildy agreed, “We've watched every game they had played, and we knew this was the best shooting team in the country. If there is another team in the country that shoots the ball like these guys shoot, I would love to see that team.”\n\nMore Numbers From Deep\n\nCreighton tied a school-record on Dec. 31 vs. Marquette with 35 attempts from three-point range, something previously done vs. North Carolina A&T (11/11/11) and at Bradley (2/1/11). The Bluejays matched the mark on Jan. 20 at #4 Villanova, when it also made a program- and BIG EAST record 21 trifectas.\n\nHe's The Man(igat)\n\nJahenns Manigat averaged a modest 5.6 points per game in the first eight contests this season, making 15-of-33 field goal attempts (45.4 percent).\n\nSince returning home from CU's eight-day trek to California in early December, Manigat has averaged 9.6 points on 47-of-94 marksmanship (50.0 percent) from the floor, including 30-of-65 (46.2 percent) from downtown. He also owns a 55 assist, 13 turnover ratio in that time.\n\nManigat scored 15 points on Dec. 29 in a win over Chicago State, sinking 5-of-7 three-point shots.\n\nManigat then had 16 points, six rebounds and six assists in CU's win over Marquette two nights later.\n\nManigat continued his hot streak with 14 points, four rebounds and four assists at Seton Hall on Jan. 4.\n\nThis was the first time he's scored in double-digits three straight games.\n\nConsistency A Key\n\nDoug McDermott has scored 20 or more points in 18 of the 22 games he's played in this season, and 25 of his last 30 contests dating to last season. He had 19 points in two of the games where he didn't reach 20 points.\n\nNationally, only 30 players average 20 points per game or more, which gives you an idea of how hard it is to reach that mark on a nightly basis.\n\nConsistent Challengers\n\nEleven of Creighton's last 16 teams finished either first or second in The Valley's regular-season race. Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and 2012-13, tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament, while the 2010-11 club tied for fourth place.\n\nCreighton's MVC Finishes, Last 16 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01, 2012-13\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.),\n\n2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.), 2011-12 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\nMcDermott By The Numbers\n\nSenior forward Doug McDermott has put together very similar numbers throughout his career, regardless of result, site, level of competition or score differential, as seen below:\n\nBreakdown MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG PPG\n\nWins 30.5 .570 .479 .849 7.5 22.5\n\nLosses 32.5 .471 .382 .765 7.9 16.5\n\nHome 30.0 .557 .440 .836 7.6 21.5\n\nAway 31.7 .549 .487 .824 7.5 20.1\n\nNeutral 33.2 .507 .440 .843 7.7 21.5\n\nBCS Foes 32.3 .507 .403 .874 7.1 23.2\n\nNon-BCS Foes 30.7 .561 .473 .820 7.7 20.3\n\nMargin 0-9 32.8 .527 .431 .769 7.7 19.5\n\nMargin 10-19 31.3 .538 .423 .861 7.7 21.3\n\nMargin 20+ 26.8 .604 .555 .894 7.2 23.5\n\nCAREER (All) 31.0 .547 .454 .834 7.6 21.0\n\nThat's Why They're “Free” Throws\n\nA pair of Bluejay seniors have had stellar free throw streaks in recent weeks.\n\nJahenns Manigat made his first 10 attempts at the line this season after making his final 13 attempts last year, giving him a career-long streak of 23 in a row.\n\nDoug McDermott made his final three attempts against George Washington on Dec. 1 before going a combined 13-for-13 in wins vs. Long Beach State and Nebraska, giving him a streak of 16 in a row. He then made all 13 attempts on Dec. 17 vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, pushing the streak to 29 and was 2-for-2 vs. Cal to make it 31 straight. On Dec. 29 vs. Chicago State, McDermott was 8-for-8 at the line, giving him a school-record streak of 39 in a row. He extended the mark to 41 with a 2-for-2 showing on Dec. 31 vs. Marquette. McDermott also made his first four foul shots at Seton Hall on Jan. 4 before a miss snapped his streak at 45 straight.\n\nEarlier this year McDermott had a streak of 28 straight makes snapped in CU's season-opening victory over Alcorn State.\n\nConsecutive Free Throws Made, (Since 1980)\n\nFT Name Dates of Streak\n\n45 Doug McDermott Dec. 1, 2013 - Jan. 4, 2014\n\n36 Booker Woodfox Dec. 6, 2008-Jan. 6, 2009\n\n35 Bob Portman 1967-68\n\n32 Michael Lindeman Jan. 23-Nov. 29, 2003\n\n28 Kyle Korver Jan. 27-March 15, 2001\n\n28 Doug McDermott March 10 - Nov. 8, 2013\n\n27 Matt West Nov. 27, 1999-Jan. 15, 2000\n\n27 Kyle Korver Jan. 29-Nov. 20, 2000\n\n27 Nate Funk Dec. 30, 2006-Jan. 12, 2007\n\n24 Rick Apke Jan. 22-Feb. 5, 1977\n\n24 Rod Mason Jan. 28-Feb. 4, 1988\n\n24 Kyle Korver Mar. 15-Dec. 4, 2001\n\n24 Ethan Wragge Feb. 3, 2010 - Feb. 1, 2012\n\n23 Jahenns Manigat Feb. 9, 2013 - Jan. 7, 2014\n\n22 Matt Petty Jan. 4-Feb. 4, 1993\n\n22 Ryan Sears Feb. 22-Nov. 22, 1999\n\n22 Nate Funk Feb. 26-Mar. 17, 2005\n\n22 Cavel Witter Nov. 9-Dec. 5, 2007\n\nDougie McAutomatic?\n\nDoug McDermott was a perfect 13-for-13 at the line on Dec. 17 vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff.\n\nMcDermott became the first Bluejay to be perfect in 13 or more attempts from the line since Doug Brookins went 16-for-16 on Dec. 16, 1974.\n\nIn addition to Brookins, the only other CU players to make all of their 13+ attempts in the same game were Mike Caruso (14-14 on 1/21/70) and Bob Portman (13-13 on 1/13/68).\n\nToe The Line\n\nCreighton shot a school-record 75.9 percent from the free-throw line last season, and with much of the same team back, it's no surprise the team is shooting 75.9 percent at the line in 2013-14.\n\nCreighton has shot 77.3 percent or better from the stripe in 12 of the last 16 games, connecting on 230-of-289 overall (79.6 percent) in that time.\n\nCreighton has missed two or less free throws in seven of its last 13 games, going 24-for-26 vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, 11-of-13 vs. Cal, 20-of-22 vs. Chicago State, 4-for-4 vs. Marquette, 7-of-8 at Seton Hall, 12-of-13 at Providence and 19-of-21 free throws at St. John's.\n\nDefense Improves\n\nTwo years ago Creighton ranked 222nd in the nation in field goal percentage defense, as teams shot 44.1 percent from the field.\n\nLast year the squad improved to 77th nationally, as teams dropped to 40.7 percent from the floor against the Jays.\n\nThe team continues to make strides in that area, holding foes to 40.8 percent marksmanship this year to rank 67th nationally.\n\nOnly nine of Creighton's first 22 opponents have shot 40 percent or better from the field this season.\n\nCreighton's field goal percentage defense of 40.8 percent gives the team a chance to become the first squad since the 1962-63 club to hold foes to 40 percent (39.3%, 706-1795).\n\nFull House\n\nLast year's Creighton team ranked sixth nationally in average home attendance, averaging 17,155 fans per game. It's the seventh straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and set an MVC average home attendance record. The figure ranked ahead of 14 NBA teams (76ers, Rockets, Grizzlies, Wizards, Timberwolves, Cavaliers, Suns, Bobcats, Pacers, Hawks, Bucks, Pistons, Pelicans, Kings).\n\nCreighton also ranked sixth nationally in men's soccer attendance and 10th in baseball attendance, the nation's only school in the top-10 of those three sports.\n\nThis year's Creighton team is averaging 17,686 through 13 home dates, good for fifth-nationally.\n\n2013-14 Attendance Leaders (2/7)\n\nRk.

It marked the first time in his career he'd posted back-to-back contests of 15 or more points, and made him the first Bluejay reserve with consecutive games of 15+ points since Cavel Witter on Dec. 22 & 29, 2009.\n\nWragge finished three games at the Wooden Legacy averaging 12.3 points, 6.0 rebounds and 0.7 blocked shots. He tied for the Wooden Legacy lead with 11 three-point baskets, converting 47.8 percent of his 23 long-range attempts.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton has attracted eight of its 20 largest home crowds in program history this season.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's top-20 home crowds all-time.\n\nRank Att. Opponent Date\n\n1. 18,859 Georgetown 01/25/14\n\n2. 18,735 Wichita State 02/11/12\n\n3. 18,613 Wichita State 03/02/13\n\n4. 18,525 Marquette 12/31/13\n\n5. 18,494 Illinois State 02/09/13\n\n6. 18,458 Evansville 12/29/12\n\n7. 18,436 Bradley 01/28/12\n\n8. 18,323 DePaul 02/07/14\n\n9. 18,111 Bradley 02/02/13\n\n10. 18,078 Tulsa 11/23/13\n\n11. 18,073 Drake 01/08/13\n\n12. 17,954 Wichita State 12/28/08\n\n13. 17,740 Alcorn State 11/08/13\n\n14. 17,694 Indiana State 01/05/13\n\n15. 17,676 Northwestern 12/22/11\n\n16. 17,665 Missouri State 12/28/11\n\n17. 17,607 Drexel 02/17/07\n\n18. 17,602 Butler 01/14/14\n\n19. 17,589 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n20. 17,533 California 12/22/13\n\nSpeaking of 30\n\nAccording to available school records, Doug McDermott owns 22 of the 128 games in Creighton history with 30 points or more. That ties Bob Portman for most 30-point games in program history.\n\nIn addition, McDermott's eight games this season of 30 points or more are tied for third-most in school history. He also owns fifth and seventh place on that list.\n\nMost 30-Point Games, Career\n\n30-Pt.

He scored 41 points in his final home game last year vs. Wichita State (March 2), 37 against UMKC (Nov. 11), 33 vs. Tulsa (Nov. 23), 33 vs. Nebraska (Dec. 8), 35 vs. Xavier (Jan. 12), 39 points vs. St. John's (Jan. 28) and 32 points vs. DePaul (Feb. 7).\n\nMcDermott's 33 points were the most by a Bluejay against Nebraska since Duan Cole had 35 points on Dec. 7, 1991.\n\nIn his last 14 home games, McDermott has played 452 minutes and scored a staggering 400 points.\n\nMcDermott has scored 30 or more points in 22 career games. By comparison, all other Creighton players since 1991-92 have combined for 17 games of 30+ points in CU's 718 games played in that period.\n\nExperienced Starters\n\nOne reason for Creighton's success is its veteran line-up. Creighton's recent starting line-up (before Gibbs' injury) has a combined 22 years of college experience under their belt, including 20 seasons at Creighton.\n\nGrant Gibbs is a sixth-year senior who is in his fourth year with the Bluejay program. He has started every game the past three seasons and before his recent injury was on pace to challenge CU's record for career assists.\n\nEthan Wragge is a fifth-year senior who medically redshirted after plantar fasciitis issues during his second year on campus. He is second in school history in three-pointers made, trailing only 11-year NBA veteran Kyle Korver.\n\nBoth Jahenns Manigat and Doug McDermott are four-year seniors. McDermott has started every game of his career, while Manigat has started all but one of the last 108 games. McDermott already owns Creighton records for career points, field goals, three-point percentage and consecutive free throws made.\n\nAccording to Ken Pomeroy's advanced statistics, Creighton's line-up averages 2.39 years of experience, making the Bluejays the 16th-most veteran group nationally, and tops among the nation's BCS schools.\n\nBench Points\n\nCreighton's bench has averaged 25.0 points and 14.9 rebounds per contest. The reserves are shooting 51.7% from the field and 38.8% from downtown.\n\nBoth Ethan Wragge and Devin Brooks own games of 20 points or more this season in a reserve role.\n\nKorver Sets NBA Record\n\nCreighton alum Kyle Korver continues to extend his NBA record streak of games with a three-pointer.\n\nKorver enters Saturday's (Feb. 8) game vs. Memphis with a three-pointer in 117 straight games, smashing Dana Barros' previous league-record of 89, and double the length of Joe DiMaggio's hallowed hit streak in baseball.\n\nIn 2009-10, Korver set an NBA single-season record by shooting 53.6 percent from three-point range, a record that still stands.\n\nKorver played at Creighton from 1999-2003 and owns the school record with 371 career three-pointers, helping the Bluejays to a 29-5 mark as a senior.\n\nKorver's longest three-point streak at Creighton was 28 and snapped by Greg McDermott's UNI team. His second-longest streak was 27 and snapped by Steve Merfeld's Evansville team.\n\nKorver made at least one trifecta in 114 of his 128 games as a Bluejay.\n\nLet's Chat About Austin\n\nJunior point guard Austin Chatman had the best scoring day of his Creighton tenure on Nov. 23rd when he scored a career-high 19 points in an 82-72 win vs. Tulsa.\n\nChatman had 15 points before the break and made a career-best four three-point hoops on the afternoon.\n\nMore recently, Chatman had a career-best eight rebounds vs. George Washington on Dec. 1st.\n\nChatman averaged 1.86 rebounds per game in his first two years on campus, but averages 3.9 per contest this season, including four or more caroms in 13 of 22 contests.\n\nChasing 3,000\n\nIn Major League Baseball, producing 3,000 career hits is something that's been done by just 24 Hall of Famers in history.\n\nDoug McDermott has a chance to become just the eighth Division I male in NCAA history to score 3,000 or more points if he can stay healthy and average roughly 25 points per game this season.\n\nTo help put McDermott's career in perspective, the chart on page eight shows how many points McDermott owns and which famous ballplayer that is most comparable to. This season alone, McDermott has surpassed legends like Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Ryne Sandberg, Mike Schmidt, Kirby Puckett, Ernie Banks and Willie Stargell.\n\nProductive Minutes\n\nAccording to bbstate.com, Doug McDermott ranks first nationally this season with 31.6 points per 40 minutes played.\n\nMcDermott led the same category last year with 29.3 points per 40 minutes, and was second as a sophomore at 28.7 points per 40 minutes.\n\nRare Air\n\nDoug McDermott had 33 points and 15 rebounds in a Nov. 23 win vs. Tulsa, leading to some additional research on the senior All-American.\n\nMcDermott was the first Creighton player with at least 33 points and 15 rebounds since Bob Harstad's 33/17 on December 6, 1989 vs. Cleveland State.\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nIncluding this year, Creighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 13 of the last 15 seasons. Each of Creighton's last 14 3-0 starts have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year.\n\nThis season marks the third straight year Creighton has opened 4-0, something last done from 2002-03 to 2004-05. The only other time CU started 4-0 in three straight years had come in a five-year stretch from 1916-17 to 1920-21.\n\nWragge Bombs Away\n\nEthan Wragge has attempted 162 of his 168 shots this season from three-point range, sinking an incredible 81 of them (50 percent) behind the arc. He was 7-for-11 from deep in CU's 83-79 win at Saint Joseph's on Nov. 16, the most treys by a Bluejay in a game since Booker Woodfox had seven (also at Saint Joseph's) in 2008, before tying Kyle Korver's school record with nine three-pointers at No. 4 Villanova on Jan. 20th.\n\nWith four three-pointers vs. George Washington on Dec. 1, Wragge moved past Ryan Sears into second place in Creighton history for career trifectas. He now owns 302 career treys.\n\nHe also ranks fifth in CU history with 44.3 percent marksmanship from downtown.\n\nFor his career, Wragge has attempted 689-of-742 shots from beyond the arc.\n\nMcDermott, For The Win\n\nDoug McDermott drained his first career game-winner in a Nov. 16 victory at Saint Joseph's. With Creighton trailing by one and 6.9 seconds left, McDermott caught an inbounds pass, hit a fadeaway jumper, and was fouled. He converted the three-point play in CU's eventual 83-79 win.\n\nSaid McDermott after the game “I didn't know how to celebrate…I've never hit one before.”\n\nMcDermott is now 7-for-9 from the field and 20-for-24 from the line in the last minute of games in the past two seasons.\n\nCreighton had not won a game when trailing in the final minute of overtime since Feb. 21, 2012, when Josh Jones hit a game-winner to beat Evansville in the final 30 seconds of overtime. Creighton had also tied that same game as time expired on a Gregory Echenique tip-in to close regulation.\n\nCreighton last won a road game when trailing in the final minute on Jan. 7, 2011, at Southern Illinois, taking the lead for good with 36 seconds left on two Darryl Ashford free throws.\n\nCreighton last won a game away from home when trailing in the final five seconds on March 6, 2009, when Booker Woodfox hit a buzzer-beater to stun Wichita State in the MVC Tournament quarterfinals.\n\nMartelli On McDermott\n\nEven before Doug McDermott hit a three-point play to beat Saint Joseph's, Hawks coach Phil Martelli was overwhelmingly complimentary on the skills of Doug McDermott. Here's what he had to say about McDermott prior to the game:\n\n“The country is gaga over these freshmen but McDermott's the best player in the country. Tell me who does more for their team. They can give the awards at the end of the year to the freshmen because of the media blitz, but that kid is a magnificent, magnificent player.”\n\nJust Like Viejas Arena?\n\nCreighton's win at Saint Joseph's had some similarities to its road win at San Diego State two years ago.\n\nIn both games, Creighton faced an early double-digit deficit before cutting into the lead before half (17 at SDSU, 13 at SJU).\n\nIn both games, Creighton got big nights from Ethan Wragge (19 points at SDSU, 21 at SJU).\n\nIn both games, Creighton held on to a lead in the last 10 seconds.\n\nIn both games, Creighton was playing its first true road game of the season, and in front of a sellout crowd known as one of the toughest atmospheres in college basketball.\n\nBig Deficits, Big Deal\n\nCreighton overcame a 13-point deficit to win at Saint Joseph's on Nov. 16 before posting an 83-79 win, then overcame another 13-point deficit to beat Xavier on Jan. 12th. It was the 10th and 11th times in four seasons under Greg McDermott that the Jays have won a game its trailed by double-figures at some point, including six such comebacks away from home.\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 86-5 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 74 of the last 75 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under G. McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n@McDermottAlert Has You Covered\n\nRather than clog up its other social media accounts with the many exploits of Doug McDermott, Creighton Athletics has created a Twitter account specific to him, that can be found at twitter.com/McDermottAlert.\n\nIt contains links to dozens of national profiles and stats on the senior forward, and owns more than 1,700 followers.\n\nJays Sign A Pair Of Recruits\n\nA pair of high school basketball standouts have signed letters-of-intent to play at Creighton University. Leon Gilmore III and Ronnie Harrell will both be freshmen when they enroll in the fall of 2014 and have four years of eligibility.\n\nGilmore is a 6'7” wing from Manvel, Texas, who attends Manvel High School and plays for coach Greg Devers. As a high school junior, he helped his team to a 30-6 record by averaging 13.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. Gilmore competes for the Houston Hoops AAU program.\n\nHarrell is a 6'7” wing from Denver (Colo.) East High School, where he plays for Rudy Carey. As a junior he averaged 13.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game, helping the Angels reach the state title game. On the AAU circuit, Harrell plays for Billups Elite, which is supported by his cousin, NBA veteran Chauncey Billups.\n\n20-20-20-20-20-20 Vision\n\nDoug McDermott opened his senior season with 20 points vs. Alcorn State, 37 points vs. UMKC, 20 points at Saint Joseph's, 33 points vs. Tulsa, 27 points vs. Arizona State and 30 points vs. San Diego State. In the process, he became the first Bluejay to start a season with at least five consecutive games of 20 or more points since Bob Portman opened with five straight games in 1968-69.\n\nUse The Four's\n\nDoug McDermott converted a rare four-point play on Nov. 11 vs. UMKC, sinking a three-point shy while being fouled before making the subsequent free throw. Isaiah Zierden followed suit on Nov. 28 vs. Arizona State. Avery Dingman became the third Bluejay to do it when he converted a four-point play at DePaul on Jan. 7.\n\nIn Greg McDermott's four-year tenure at Creighton, the only previous players with a four-point play had been Kaleb Korver and Ethan Wragge, who had done it once each.\n\nCrowd Control\n\nCreighton's sellout crowd of 17,740 on Nov. 8 vs. Alcorn State was its largest ever for a home-opener. It was also Creighton's largest home crowd for any November game, and the ninth-largest home crowd in program history.\n\nHottest Ticket in Town\n\nCreighton Basketball has proven to be a hot ticket in recent years, but the anticipation for this season has taken those levels up a notch.\n\nCreighton sold more than 15,100 season tickets for the first time, a figure that doesn't factor in students. Last year's record was 13,739.\n\nCreighton has also sold more than 2,100 all-session tickets for the BIG EAST Tournament already, the most by any league school since Connecticut in 2006.\n\nWhen single-game tickets went on sale on Oct. 29, seven games sold out within an hour, including less than 20 minutes for games vs. Marquette, Georgetown, Nebraska, Seton Hall and Chicago State.\n\nNation's Best Offense?\n\nYou can make a case that Creighton boasted the nation's best offensive production last year.\n\nCreighton was second in the country in field goal percentage (50.1) and three-point percentage (41.4), third in two-point field goal percentage (55.7), ninth in free-throw percentage (75.9) and 10th in three-pointers per game (8.5).\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranked nationally in the first three years of the Greg McDermott tenure (does not include 2013-14):\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank '13-14\n\nFG Percentage .487 1st .492\n\n3FG Percentage .401 2nd .425\n\nAssists 1,793 4th 405\n\nAssists/Game 16.30 5th 18.4\n\n3FG Made 874 6th 237\n\nAssist/Turnover Ratio 1.34 10th 1.82\n\nFG Made 2,852 13th 617\n\nWins 80 T-16th 19\n\nWinning Pct. .727 26th .864\n\nAsk The Experts\n\nESPN had 20 experts predict the 2013-14 season. Nine of them (Jay Bilas, Adrian Branch, Elena Bergeron, Dan Dakich, Jimmy Dykes, Myron Medcalf, Digger Phelps, Miles Simon and Dick Vitale) predicted Doug McDermott would be National Player of the Year.\n\nCBS Sports asked six experts to predict the 2013-14 season. Two of them (Doug Gottlieb and Jon Rothstein) picked McDermott would be National Player of the Year.\n\nSports Illustrated had four experts predict the 2014-14 season. Two of them (Seth Davis and Luke Winn) picked McDermott would be National Player of the Year.\n\nAll told, McDermott collected 13 votes, Oklahoma State's Marcus Smart 10 votes, Kansas' Andrew Wiggins three votes, Kentucky's Julius Randle three votes and Louisville's Russ Smith one vote.\n\nWeekly Honor For McDermott Doug McDermott was named National Player of the Week by ESPN.com and BIG EAST Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 16th after averaging 25.7 points and 5.7 rebounds in three Creighton wins to start the season. McDermott made 55.8 percent from the field, 53.3 percent from three-point land, and 78.6 percent of his free throw attempts.\n\nMcDermott then earned his second consecutive BIG EAST Player of the Week honor on Nov. 23rd when he got the nod following a 33 point, 15 rebound showing in a 82-72 triumph vs. Tulsa.\n\nMcDermott earned his third BIG EAST honor on Dec. 9 after averaging 27.0 points and 6.0 rebounds in lopsided wins over Long Beach State and Nebraska.\n\nIncluding his seven MVC Newcomer of the Week honors in 2010-11, 13 MVC Player of the Week honors from 2011-13, and six BIG EAST Player of the Week accolades of 2013-14, McDermott has now won at least one conference weekly award from the MVC or BIG EAST in 26 of 61 weeks since enrolling at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott Honored at Wooden Legacy\n\nDoug McDermott added to his career honor roll when he picked up All-Tournament Team accolades at the Wooden Legacy.\n\nMcDermott led all players by averaging 21.3 points per game and also topped all players with 21 field goals made and 16 defensive rebounds.\n\nSan Diego State's Xavier Thames was named Wooden Legacy MVP after leading the Aztecs to the title.\n\nBrooks Breaks Harden's Record\n\nDevin Brooks set a Wooden Legacy for three-point marksmanship. Brooks was 6-for-8 from long-range at the Wooden Legacy (75.0 percent), well ahead of the previous mark set by James Harden of 66.7 percent (10-15) in 2008.\n\nRecord Watch\n\nWith seven field goals on Nov. 8, Doug McDermott took over sole possession of first place on Creighton's all-time field goals made list. He now owns 1,001 in his career. He had entered the season tied with Chad Gallagher (1987-91) for the school-record with 811.\n\nMcDermott also made four free throws vs. Alcorn State, passing MLB Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson for third in CU history, and now owns 538.\n\nPreseason Acclaim\n\nDoug McDermott has garnered a ton of preseason hype you'd expect from a returning two-time consensus First Team All-American.\n\nIn addition to being named the Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year, McDermott has also been named a Preseason First Team All-American by the Associated Press, USA Today, Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook, CBSSports.com, NBCSports.com and Sporting News.\n\nMcDermott is also one of 30 candidates for the Senior CLASS Award, one of 15 men named to the Oscar Robertson Trophy Watch List, and one of 50 players on the preseason watch list for the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 14 of the last 15 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust five schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 15 years: Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas and Syracuse.\n\nCreighton is one of four schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 14 of the past 15 years. That list consists of Creighton, Kent State, Kentucky and Utah State.\n\nThat's better than traditional powers Arizona, Connecticut and Memphis (13 each) and also ahead of Michigan State, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin (12 each).\n\n10 Conference Wins x 17\n\nLast season's Creighton team won 10 or more league games for a 17th consecutive season.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 17 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas (19).\n\nEach of the last 17 seasons has seen the team finish fourth place or better in the league standings as well, though all of those took place in the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nPostseason x 16\n\nCreighton has made the postseason in 16 consecutive seasons. The only eight schools to make the postseason in each of the last 16 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to an NCAA Tournament win over Cincinnati last spring, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record six straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nThe following five programs are the only ones that have won a postseason game in six straight seasons, including 2012-13: Creighton, Kansas, North Carolina, Purdue and Syracuse.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish third in its first season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Marquette was picked first with 74 points and five first-place votes, while Georgetown (70, 2) was also selected ahead of the Bluejays (61, 1). Rounding out the top half were Villanova (58) and St. John's (56, 2).\n\nCreighton forward Doug McDermott was named preseason BIG EAST Conference Player of the Year by the coaches.\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nSenior forward Doug McDermott served as a captain for Team USA last summer at the World University Games in Kazan, Russia. Playing under the direction of coaches Bob McKillop (Davidson), John Beilein (Michigan) and Frank Martin (South Carolina), McDermott led the team in scoring (14.1 ppg.), field goals (39), three-pointers (18), free throws (17), free-throw percentage (.895) and minutes (23.8) as the team went 6-2 in eight games.\n\nOn his way back from Russia, McDermott was invited to the USA Basketball Men's National Team Mini-Camp along with 28 of the NBA's rising stars and fellow collegian Marcus Smart (Oklahoma State), where he received rave reviews.\n\nArmy of Iowans\n\nEvery Creighton team since 1988-89 has had at least one Iowa native, and this season is no exception.\n\nCreighton has five players from Iowa on this season's team, continuing a long trend of relying on some of the Hawkeye State's top preps. CU's Iowans this season includes seniors Grant Gibbs (Marion) and Doug McDermott (Ames), junior Will Artino (Waukee), sophomore Alex Olsen (Council Bluffs) and freshman John Burns (Algona).\n\nOther past notable Iowans include Kyle Korver (Pella), Ryan Sears (Ankeny), Brody Deren (Harlan), Tyler McKinney (Urbandale) and Nate Funk (Sioux City).\n\nCreighton has played at least one Iowa native in 643 straight games. That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State.\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 667 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 183 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in 11 seasons at the facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own an 158-25 (.863) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (8-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 13,796-11,663 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.7 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 48 different times, including five times last season and the Nebraska, Arkansas-Pine Bluff, California, Chicago State, Marquette, Butler and St. John's games this year.\n\nCreighton is also 23-15 all-time in the 38 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nBig Margin Leads To Big Things\n\nCreighton's 107-61 win on Nov. 8 vs. Alcorn State was its highest point total in a season-opener ever, one point more than the 2002-03 team that opened with a 106-50 win over Texas-Arlington. The 2002-03 team went on to be 29-5.\n\nEight of Creighton's 18 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last six teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n107-61 Alcorn State 11/08/13 ? ? ? ? ?\n\n97-65 N.

He was also named to the 10-man John R. Wooden Award All-America team.\n\nPrior to McDermott, the only other player honored by the USBWA with All-America status had been second-team selection Kyle Korver in 2003, and the only prior NABC selections from Creighton had been second-teamer Paul Silas (1964) and third-team selections Benoit Benjamin (1985) and Korver (2003).\n\nOscar, Bird, Doug\n\nDoug McDermott set a Creighton (and MVC) record for points by a freshman with 581 in 2010-11.\n\nAs a sophomore McDermott had 801 points, joining Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird as the only sophomores in MVC history with at least 800 points in a season.\n\nLast year McDermott became the first player in MVC history to reach 2,000 career points as a junior, and joined Robertson and Bird as the only players in league history to reach 2,000 points in less than three seasons of work.\n\nBelow is a list of the most prolific scorers in MVC history, as well as the top single-season scorers in Creighton history (all classes):\n\nTop Scorers, MVC History (All Years)\n\nPts.

Name, School Next Game\n\n1. 2,773 Doug McDermott, Creighton 2/9\n\n2. 2,174 Travis Bader, Oakland 2/9\n\nScoring In Numbers\n\nDoug McDermott owned 834 points in 36 games last year, an average of 23.2 per contest that ranked him second nationally in scoring.\n\nMcDermott's 23.2 points per game ranked fourth-most in CU single-season history and were the most since Bob Portman averaged 26.2 points per game in 1968-69.\n\nPortman, who finished fifth nationally in scoring in 1967-68 (29.5 ppg.), was the only previous Bluejay to ever rank in the top-10 of the year-end scoring leaders, before McDermott did it each of the past two seasons (3rd in 2011-12, 2nd last year).\n\nMcDermott's 23.2 points per game were the most by a MVC player since Bradley's Curtis Stuckey (25.1 ppg.) in 1990-91.\n\nRepeat All-American\n\nDoug McDermott joined some elite company by being named a First Team All-American by the USBWA, Associated Press and the NABC for a second consecutive season last spring.\n\nHe is the 70th player to repeat the honor from the USBWA, 55th from the NABC, and 51st in the history of the Associated Press.\n\nIf McDermott is named First Team All-American by the AP this year, he'll become the first three-time first team selection since Patrick Ewing and Wayman Tisdale from 1983-85.\n\nNot Half Bad\n\nDoug McDermott's highest scoring half of his career has been 31 points, done as a sophomore in the second half at Bradley when he scored a career-best 44 points.\n\nMcDermott has scored 15 points or more in a half 60 times during his career, and Creighton is 48-3 in those contests (nine times he's scored 15 or more in both halves).\n\nMcDermott owns 14 halves in his career with 20 or more points, and just six scoreless halves.\n\nThe 800 Club\n\nCreighton's Doug McDermott led the nation with 834 points last season after owning a league-high (and second-most nationally) 801 as a sophomore.\n\nMcDermott joined Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird as the third player in MVC history with multiple 800-point seasons.\n\nNationwide, McDermott was the first player with consecutive seasons of 800 points or more since Stephen Curry (Davidson) and Lester Hudson (Tennessee-Martin) in both 2007-08 and 2008-09.\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nDoug McDermott was Creighton's only player to average in double-figures last year, but he had lots of support to help lead the Jays to 28 wins.\n\nCreighton was 11-0 when Ethan Wragge scored in double-figures last year. CU is 38-3 under Greg McDermott when Wragge shoots 50 percent or better from three-point range, and 29-3 under McDermott when Wragge scores in double-figures.\n\nCreighton was 8-1 when Austin Chatman scored in double-figures last year.\n\nCreighton was 6-2 when Jahenns Manigat scored in double-figures last year. CU is now 25-1 all-time when Manigat makes three or more 3-pointers, including 23 straight wins, and the Jays are 25-2 (with 23 straight wins) when Manigat shoots better than 50 percent from 3-point range.\n\nCreighton is 14-0 all-time when Avery Dingman makes multiple three-pointers.\n\nCreighton is 47-4 all-time when Will Artino (64.8 percent) misses a field goal attempt.\n\nHis Own Game of H-O-R-S-E\n\nDoug McDermott led the nation in 2011-12 with 307 field goals made, and his 284 buckets last year once again led the nation.\n\nPrior to McDermott, no player had led the country in field goals made in back-to-back seasons since at least 1995-96.\n\nOne area that makes McDermott so unique is his ability to use his off (left) hand, and to use the backboard, as seen below:\n\nYear FG Backboard Left-Hand\n\n2010-11 220 64 28\n\n2011-12 307 174 56\n\n2012-13 284 132 26\n\n2013-14 190 70 16\n\nTotals 1,001 440 126\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 99-33 on the Creighton sideline early in his fourth year at the helm.
