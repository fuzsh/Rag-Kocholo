        "text": "NEW YORK — St. John’s has split with basketball coach Steve Lavin after five seasons.\n\nThe school announced Friday it has “mutually agreed to part ways” with Lavin. He had one year left on his contract.\n\nThe Red Storm lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, beaten by San Diego State 76-64 to finish at 21-12. Lavin and the Red Storm reached the NCAAs in his first and last seasons. The 21 wins matched the most victories under Lavin.\n\nAthletic director Chris Monasch says Lavin “returned high expectations” to the program and “represented St. John’s in a positive way.”"
