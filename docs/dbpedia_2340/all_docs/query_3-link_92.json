        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Lavin\n\nLinda Lavin (born October 15, 1937) is an American singer and actress. She is known for playing the title character in the sitcom Alice and for her stage performances, both on Broadway and Off-Broadway.\n\nAfter acting as a child, Lavin joined the Compass Players in the late 1950s. She began acting on Broadway in the 1960s, earning notice in \"It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman\" in 1966 and receiving her first Tony Award nomination in Last of the Red Hot Lovers in 1970. She moved to Hollywood in 1973 and began to work in television, making recurring appearances on Barney Miller before getting the title role in Alice, which ran from 1976 to 1985. She appeared in many telefilms and later in other TV work. She has also had roles in several feature films.\n\nIn 1987, she returned to Broadway, starring in Broadway Bound (winning a Tony Award), Gypsy (1990), The Sisters Rosensweig (1993), The Diary of Anne Frank (1997–1998) and The Tale of the Allergist's Wife (2000–2001), among others. In 2010, she appeared as Ruth Steiner in Collected Stories, garnering her fifth Tony nomination. She starred in NBC's short-lived sitcom, Sean Saves the World in 2013 as Lorna.\n\nContents [show] Early life and career[edit] Lavin was born in Portland, Maine, the daughter of Lucille (née Potter), an opera singer, and David J. Lavin, a businessman;[1] The Lavin family were active members of the local area Jewish community. [2] Her family was musically talented, and Lavin has been onstage since the age of five. She attended Waynflete School before enrolling in the College of William and Mary. Upon her graduation from William and Mary,[3] she had already received her Actors' Equity Association card. She was a member of the Compass Players in the late 1950s.[4] By the early 1960s, Lavin had appeared in several Broadway shows and appeared on the 1966 cast recordings of The Mad Show performing Stephen Sondheim's \"The Boy From...\". From It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman, one of her numbers, \"You've Got Possibilities,\" was the album's best-received song and was called \"The one memorable song...flirty, syncopated\" by the Dallas Observer.[5]\n\nCareer[edit] Television and film[edit] In 1967, Lavin made an appearance as Gloria Thorpe in a television version of the musical Damn Yankees with Phil Silvers.[6] In 1969, Lavin married actor Ron Leibman,[7] and by 1973 the couple had arrived in Hollywood, California. After various guest appearances on episodic television series such as The Nurses, Rhoda, Harry O and Kaz,[1] Lavin landed a recurring role on Barney Miller during the first and second seasons (1975-1976).[8]\n\nShe left Barney Miller to star in the lead role in Alice. The show was a popular hit for CBS and ran from 1976 to 1985.[1] The series was based on the Martin Scorsese-directed Ellen Burstyn film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.[9] Lavin portrayed Alice Hyatt, a waitress and singer, the character that Burstyn had played. Lavin performed the series' theme song, \"There's a New Girl in Town,\" which was written by David Shire and Alan and Marilyn Bergman and was updated for each of the first six seasons. During the series' nine-season run, Lavin earned two Golden Globe Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination,[10] and gained experience directing, especially during the later seasons. Lavin also played a dual role in \"Alice\", as Debbie Walden, the wizened and former landlady of the character Vera Louise Gorman-Novak.[11] Lavin also made numerous television appearances outside of Alice, including hosting her own holiday special for CBS, Linda in Wonderland (1980).[1] She acted in two sitcoms, (1992-1993) Room for Two[11] and 1998's Conrad Bloom.[12] In Room for Two, she played a mother who moved in with her daughter, played by Patricia Heaton, who has a show on a local television station. The daughter gives Lavin's character her own segment, called Just a Thought, at the end of her program.[13][14]\n\nAfter working in theater for many years, Lavin was cast in the NBC television Sitcom Sean Saves the World playing Sean Hayes' pushy, meddling mother Lorna. The Los Angeles Times interviewer noted: \"A highlight of the show is the wonderful chemistry between Lavin and Hayes, who exchange repartee and quips with breezy ease. And the cast seems smitten with her.\"[15] The show has been cancelled.\n\nShe made numerous television guest appearances, including roles on The Muppet Show (1979), Law & Order: Criminal Intent, The O.C., Touched by an Angel (1999)[1] and HBO's The Sopranos.\n\nShe also appeared in many telefilms between 1967 and 1998, including: Damn Yankees!, Sadbird, The Morning After, Jerry, Like Mom, Like Me, The $5.20 an Hour Dream, A Matter of Life and Death, Another Woman's Child, Maricela, Lena: My 100 Children, Whitewash, A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story, Stolen Memories: Secrets from the Rose Garden, For the Future: The Irvine Fertility Scandal, The Ring, and Best Friends for Life.[1] She directed the 1990 telefilm Flour Babies.[11][16]\n\nLavin made her feature film debut in The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984).[17] Her other feature film appearances include See You in the Morning, starring Jeff Bridges, and Alain Resnais's I Want to Go Home, opposite Gérard Depardieu (both 1989) and The Back-Up Plan (2010).[18]\n\nTheatre[edit] Lavin began her career with Broadway appearances in the musical A Family Affair (1962)[19] and plays such as The Riot Act (1963)[20] and Carl Reiner's Something Different (1967).[21] In his New York Times review of John Guare's two one-act plays, Cop-Out (1969), Clive Barnes wrote: \"Miss Lavin...carries versatility almost to the point of paranoia, and camps up a storm.\"[22]\n\nShe \"arrived at showbiz stardom with a featured role\" in the musical It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman (1966).[23][24] She received her first Tony Award nomination in 1970, for her role in the Neil Simon play, Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1969). Clive Barnes, in his review for The New York Times, wrote: \"Linda Lavin, eyebrows, [sic] flaunting like telegraphed messages, mouth twitching and pouting, voice as dry as thunder and with a cough like electric static, is beautiful as Elaine, the sex cat feeling coolly kittenish and looking for a safe tin roof.\"[20][25] Lavin's last Broadway credit before she moved to Hollywood was in Paul Sills' Story Theatre in 1971.[26]\n\nIn her early years, Lavin also appeared in numerous Off-Broadway productions, including the revueWet Paint (1965),[27] the musical The Mad Show (1966)[28] and Little Murders (1969). Lavin won the Theatre World Award for Wet Paint[29] and a Drama Desk Award for Little Murders.[30][31]\n\nAfter more than a decade away, appearing on television, Lavin returned to the Broadway stage in 1987, winning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play[32] and her second Drama Desk Award for her role as Kate in Simon's play Broadway Bound. Frank Rich, in his New York Times review, wrote: \"One only wishes that Ms. Lavin, whose touching performance is of the same high integrity as the writing, could stay in the role forever.\"[33] Theatre critic Charles McNulty wrote of her performance that it \"is widely considered one of the most memorable in contemporary Broadway history, winning not just awards but praise approaching the level of myth. The distinguished theater critic Gordon Rogoff, extolling 'the power available only to an actor at the height of her own command of detail,' went so far as to describe Lavin's portrayal as 'one of those textbook lessons in great acting...' \"[34]\n\nShe then starred on Broadway in Gypsy as Mama Rose Hovick, replacing Tyne Daly in July 1990.[35] June Havoc saw Lavin's performance in Gypsy and sent Lavin a photo of Havoc's mother, the real Rose Hovick, with a note of appreciation for Lavin's particular portrayal of the character.[36]\n\nSubsequent Broadway roles included The Sisters Rosensweig, as a replacement Gorgeous Teitelbaum starting in September 1993[37] and Mrs. Van Daan in The Diary of Anne Frank (1997–1998), opposite Natalie Portman, for which she garnered a Tony nomination as Featured Actress in a Play.[26][38] In 1995 she appeared in the Off-Broadway Death-Defying Acts, which consists of three one-act plays; Lavin performed in the Elaine May (\"Hotline\") and Woody Allen plays (\"Central Park West\").[39] She was nominated for a Drama Desk Award (Outstanding Actress - Play)[40] and won an Obie Award (Performance)[41] and the Lucille Lortel Award. She also directed theater during this period.\n\nShe played Marjorie in The Tale of the Allergist's Wife (2000–2001), co-starring Tony Roberts and Michele Lee, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award, Leading Actress in a Play, and Drama Desk Award,[42] and \"nanny\" in Hollywood Arms in Chicago and on Broadway in 2002.[43]\n\nIn 2010, Lavin appeared as Ruth Steiner in a Broadway revival of the play Collected Stories,[44] reprising her role for a PBS production of the play,[45] and received a fifth Tony nomination for the role. She appeared in the new play by Jon Robin Baitz, Other Desert Cities, Off-Broadway at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater (Lincoln Center) beginning in previews in December 2010, closing February 27, 2011.[46] Lavin was featured in the Kennedy Center (Washington, DC) production of the musical Follies, from May 2011 to June 2011, as Hattie Walker.[47]\n\nShe appeared in the premiere of the Nicky Silver play The Lyons at the Off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre, beginning in September 2011, through November 11.[48] Ben Brantley, The New York Times reviewer, commented: \"Watching Ms. Lavin, I found myself thinking of Nora from Ibsen’s 'Doll’s House' — well, a pursed-lipped, lemony-sour, older Nora in pseudo-Chanel, one who’s never at a loss for what to say and when to say it. Rita may be a little behind schedule in discovering herself, but no one can fault the hair-trigger timing of the actress playing her or the surprising dimensions she finds within one-liners.\"[49] She reprised her role in the Broadway production, which opened at the Cort Theatre on April 23, 2012 and closed on July 1, 2012.[50][51]\n\nLavin appears in the new Nicky Silver play Too Much Sun, which opened Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theater on May 18, 2014. Ben Brantley in his review for The New York Times wrote: \"And it’s an unconditional treat to witness an actress like Ms. Lavin tuned so precisely into the writer’s wavelength that script and performance become a marriage of true minds.\"[52]\n\nCabaret and recording[edit] Lavin has appeared in cabaret and concert performances.[53] In 2005 she appeared at the Empire Plush Room in San Francisco, accompanied by Billy Stritch[54] and her husband, Steve Bakunas. The talkinbroadway reviewer summed up her performance: \"Linda Lavin is funny, warm and full of personality.\"[55] In April 2006 she performed at Birdland (New York) \"with her critically acclaimed cabaret act The Song Remembers When\", with Billy Stritch.[56] She performed with the Wilmington Symphony (Wilmington, North Carolina) in March 2012.[57]\n\nHer recording, Possibilities was released by Ghostlight Records in 2012. Steven Suskin wrote: \"There is still that sweet, friendly sound of long ago (and 'sweet' and 'friendly' are not words you'd use to describe Lavin-the-actress).\"[58]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nLavin and husband Steve Bakunas at the Kennedy Center, June 19, 2011 Lavin has been married three times. Her first marriage to Ron Leibman ended in divorce in 1980. Her second marriage to Kip Niven, who played the boyfriend of Beth Howland's character, Vera Louise Gorman-Novak, ended in divorce in 1992.[59] While Lavin has no biological children, she was stepmother to the children of her second husband, and is stepmother to those of her third and current husband, artist/musician Steve Bakunas, whom she married in 2005.[60] The couple had resided in Wilmington, North Carolina[47] where they were committed community members working together to rehabilitate impoverished neighborhoods including renovating many homes, donating a park to the city and creating a community theater, the Red Barn Studio. In 1997, Lavin founded The Linda Lavin Arts Foundation in Wilmington, \"to promote and foster the advancement of the performing and visual arts, with special emphasis on arts in education. Her foundation has created a theater program called Girl Friends, whose purpose is to raise the self-esteem of at-risk teenage girls of the inner city.\"[18]\n\nIn Wilmington, she was a stage director. One of her directorial credits was a 1998 production of William Shakespeare's As You Like It, updated to a Brazilian jazz style. In both Wilmington and New York she teaches master classes in acting and singing.[18]\n\nIn September 2012 Lavin announced that she intended to sell her home in Wilmington and return to New York City.[61] Lavin and Bakunas have lived in New York City since circa 2013-2014.[62]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit] Lavin was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame for 2010 in January 2011.[63]\n\nTony Awards 1970 Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play - Last of the Red Hot Lovers (Nominated) 1987 Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play - Broadway Bound (Won) 1998 Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play - The Diary of Anne Frank (Nominated) 2001 Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play - The Tale of the Allergist's Wife (Nominated) 2010 Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play - Collected Stories (Nominated) 2012 Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play - The Lyons (Nominated) Drama Desk Awards 1987 Outstanding Actress in a Play - Broadway Bound (Won) 2008 Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play - The New Century (Won) Obie Award 1994-95 Outstanding Actress - Death Defying Acts Golden Globe Awards 1979 Best TV Actress in a Musical or Comedy - Alice (Won) 1980 Best TV Actress in a Musical or Comedy - Alice (Won) 1981 Best TV Actress in a Musical or Comedy - Alice (Nominated) Primetime Emmy Awards 1979 Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Alice (Nominated) Work[edit] Filmography[edit] The Intern, 2015 Sean Saves the World, 2013 A Short History of Decay, 2013 Wanderlust (2012 film), 2012 The Back-Up Plan, 2010 The O.C., 2004-2005 as \"The Nana\" The Sopranos: \"No Show\" 2002 Collected Stories, 2002 (filmed play) Best Friends for Life, 1998 Conrad Bloom, 1998 (sitcom) For the Future, 1996 The Ring, 1996 Secrets from the Rose Garden, 1996 A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes Whitewash, 1994 Room for Two, 1992 (sitcom) See You in the Morning, 1989 I Want to Go Home, 1989 A Place to Call Home, 1987 Maricella, 1986 The Muppets Take Manhattan, 1984 Another Woman's Child, 1983 My 100 Children, 1983 A Matter of Life and Death, 1981 The $5.20 an Hour Dream, 1980 The Muppet Show, Season 4, Episode 2, 1979 Like Mom, Like Me, 1978 Alice, 1976 - 1985 (sitcom) Family, Season 3, Episode 5, 1977 Barney Miller, 1975 (dramedy) Jerry, 1974 The Morning After, 1974 Damn Yankees, 1967 Stage[edit] Too Much Sun by Nicky Silver, 2014 The Lyons by Nicky Silver, 2011-2012 Follies, 2011 (Kennedy Center) Collected Stories by Donald Margulies, 2010 The New Century by Paul Rudnick, 2008 (Lincoln Center)[64] Finishing the Picture by Arthur Miller, 2004 Hollywood Arms by Carol Burnett, 2002 The Tale of the Allergist's Wife by Charles Busch, 2000–2001 The Diary of Anne Frank Cakewalk, 1996 (Off-Broadway) Death Defying Acts, 1995 The Sisters Rosensweig, 1993 Gypsy, 1990 Broadway Bound, 1986–1987 The Enemy is Dead, 1973 Paul Sills' Story Theater, 1970 The Last of the Red Hot Lovers, 1969–1970 Cop-Out, 1969 Little Murders, 1967 Something Different, 1967 On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, 1967 The Mad Show, 1966 (off-Broadway) It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman, 1966 Wet Paint, 1964–1965 The Riot Act, 1963 A Family Affair, 1962"
