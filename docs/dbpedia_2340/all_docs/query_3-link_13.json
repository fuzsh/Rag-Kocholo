        "text": "John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who won 10 national titles and a record 88 consecutive games, died last night of natural causes at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He was 99.\n\nBorn near Martinsville, Ind., in 1910, the “Wizard of Westwood” turned UCLA into one of the greatest dynasties in sports history in the 1960s and ’70s. From 1963 through 1975, the Bruins won 10 out of 12 national championships, including seven in a row from 1967-73.\n\n“Coach Wooden leaves all of us a lasting legacy from a lifetime devoted to goodness,” St. John’s and former UCLA head coach Steve Lavin said in a statement. “Coach believed the court was his classroom, and basketball was a metaphor for life. He was an eternal learner and teacher.\n\n“He was the best friend and mentor one could hope for, and it is difficult to imagine a college basketball season without John Wooden being with us.”\n\nRELATED: COACHES, PLAYERS REVERE WOODEN\n\nVACCARO: ”WOODENISMS’ STAND TEST OF TIME\n\nWooden’s basketball career began as a player at Martinsville High in the 1920s. He led the school to three straight state finals, including a state championship in 1927, before going on to play at Purdue University. After winning a national championship with the Boilermakers in 1932, Wooden played professionally and coached various high schools for 11 years before enlisting in the Navy during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Wooden became the coach at Indiana State University — then known as Indiana Teacher’s College — in 1946, and stayed there two years before taking the UCLA job following the 1947-48 season.\n\nWooden patrolled the Bruins’ sidelines for the next 27 seasons, compiling a 620-147 record. But it wasn’t until his 16th season with the Bruins that Wooden broke through and won his first national championship with an undefeated season in 1963-64.\n\n“When I think of a basketball coach, the only one I ever thought of was Coach Wooden,” Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. “He had a great life and helped so many coaches until well in his 90s. Every time I talked to him he would give me some words of advice.\n\n“He’s the best of all time. There will never be another like him, and you can’t say that about too many people. It’s a sad day, but he had such an unbelievable run. I can’t tell you what he’s done for game of basketball, and it’s not just the wins. It’s the attitude and the way he carried himself. I just can’t say enough about him.”\n\nAfter winning a second title the following year, UCLA missed the NCAA Tournament completely in 1965-66. But the following season, the Bruins began the greatest run in college basketball history, and won the next seven national championships.\n\nLed first by Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and then Bill Walton, the Bruins went an incredible 205-5 over those seven seasons, including three 30-0 campaigns in 1967, ’72 and ’73. Included during that period was UCLA’s remarkable record of 88 consecutive wins, a streak that began with a win over UC Santa Barbara on Jan. 30, 1971, and lasted until a 71-70 loss to Notre Dame on Jan. 14, 1974.\n\n“It’s kind of hard to talk about Coach Wooden simply, because he was a complex man,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “But he taught in a very simple way. He just used sports as a means to teach us how to apply ourselves to any situation.\n\n“He set quite an example. He was more like a parent than a coach. He really was a very selfless and giving human being, but he was a disciplinarian. We learned all about those aspects of life that most kids want to skip over. He wouldn’t let us do that.”\n\nWooden retired at the age of 64 after the 1975 national championship game, a 92-85 win over Kentucky that gave him his 10th championship. Having already been named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 1960, Wooden became the first person named to the Hall as both a player and coach when he was inducted in 1973.\n\n“We want to thank everyone for their love and support for our father. We will miss him more than words can express,” Wooden’s son, Jim, and daughter, Nancy Muehlhausen, said in a statement. “He has been, and always will be, the guiding light for our family. The love, guidance and support he has given us will never be forgotten. Our peace of mind at this time is knowing that he has gone to be with our mother, whom he has continued to love and cherish.”\n\nWooden’s wife, Nellie, died in 1985. Besides his children, he is survived by seven grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\n— With AP"
