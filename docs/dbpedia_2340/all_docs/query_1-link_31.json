        "text": "Picture Description Cold Open: Linda Lavin asks Scooter to \"make her a sandwich,\" and he does so with magic. \"Everybody's a comedian,\" grumbles Linda. The Muppet Show Theme: As Gonzo blows his horn, he disappears in small portions (like a blind). Miss Piggy interrupts the normal flow of the show with a surprise birthday celebration for Kermit. For the opening number, she leads a cast ensemble with \"Be a Frog.\" Backstage, Kermit has to deal with Zuzu Fitzwaller, the Hungarian water juggler, who is sobbing because his act has been canceled. Kermit un-cancels the act, but Piggy re-cancels it. As Zuzu sobs onstage, Kermit is reunited with his old acting teacher, Mr. Dawson, who taught him how to say \"YAAAYY!\" Linda and the Electric Mayhem sing \"The More I See You.\" The Swedish Chef shows Linda his birthday surpriseâ€”a replica of Kermit's head made of chopped liver. Linda points out that it's not green, so the Chef spray-paints it. UK Spot: Robin and the frogs sing \"Frog Kissin'.\" Veterinarian's Hospital: In honor of Kermit's birthday, Robin makes an appearance on the operating table. Piggy demands that he will call her Aunt Piggy. Statler and Waldorf reminisce about their past birthdays, singing \"It Was a Very Good Year.\" Wayne and Wanda, the singing duo from the first season, show up and give Kermit such a guilt trip that he rehires them. When they sing, Kermit remembers why he fired them in the first place, and he does it again. Piggy is nervous about the closing number. Linda slaps Piggy into her senses. For the closing number, Linda and the cast sing \"Beyond the Blue Horizon\" on a birthday cake set."
