        "text": "Washington, April 15, 2024\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Matt Rosendale (MT-02), took to the House floor to recognize and celebrate the recent retirement of Highway Patrol Colonel Steve Lavin after over 30 years of service to the state of Montana.\n\nYou can watch his full speech by clicking the picture below:\n\n“Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Colonel Steve Lavin on his recent retirement from law enforcement with the Montana Highway Patrol after 32 years. Born in Helena, Steve grew up dedicated to serving the people of Montana. After graduating from Capital High School in 1985, Steve decided to attend Montana State University, where he later graduated and attended the Montana Law Enforcement Academy. Prior to his appointment to the Colonel position, Steve served as a Major for the Montana Highway Patrol for 28 years. Steve was dedicated to serving Montanans in any capacity, which led him to serve 4 terms in the Montana House of Representatives in Montana’s 8th district from 2011 to 2018, and I was privileged to serve beside him. In January 2021, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen appointed Steve as Colonel of the Montana Highway Patrol, where he served the remainder of his career. I will forever be grateful for Colonel Steve Lavin’s service and his unwavering dedication to the Treasure State. I wish Colonel Lavin a peaceful retirement fishing in Kalispell, he has certainly earned it. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back.”"
