        "text": "Wanted to wish a couple of fine gentlemen a Happy Birthday; Barry Rohrssen and the late, Pete Hamill.\n\nWhen you talk, “salt of the earth” they don’t come any better than these two.\n\nPete, who was an outstanding writer (I highly recommend “A Drinking Life”) passed away on August 5, 2020. Barry, AKA, “Slice” is going strong and may just be my all-time favorite person.\n\nBy now you have heard Pete Hamill has passed away. For the next few days I will pay tribute to my favorite writer.\n\nI never got the chance to tell him but Pete was a huge inspiration to this novice writer. Over the years I have devoured his work. Studied him like a college student prepares for a final exam; books, articles and lectures. Pete was a fascinating man. A man’s man.\n\nR.I.P. Pete…\n\n‘A Drinking Life’ may just be my favorite memoir of all-time. Pete wrote about his days of growing up in Brooklyn and his battle with booze. His stories are riveting. On every page I felt like I was in the scene with him. He’s that good. I highly recommend you read this compelling book.\n\n“There is no way that I could tell the story of the drinking without telling the story of my life. I learned much about being human and mastering a craft. Life doesn’t get easier when you walk away from the culture of drink. I started writing this book when some of my friends from the drinking life began to die.”\n\n(Introduction; ‘The Drinking Life’, 1993)\n\n-Steve Finamore\n\nE-Mail: Hoops135@hotmail.com\n\nTo Pete Hamill.\n\nPete’s from the neighborhood and has always been an inspiration to this amateur writer.\n\n“A Drinking Life” is one of the best memoirs I have ever read.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pick it up.\n\n“To find work that you love and work harder than other men.”\n\nThis is going to be good…\n\nJanuary 28\n\n8:00 PM\n\nHome Box Office\n\nhttps://www.hbo.com/documentaries/breslin-and-hamill-deadline-artists\n\nJimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill’s brilliant, honest and courageous writing defined New York City journalism. For five decades, these colorful columnists and longtime friends spoke for ordinary people and brought passion, wit and literary merit to their reporting on their city and nation. Their writings probed issues of race, class and the practice of journalism that resonate powerfully today.\n\nBreslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists explores the famed writers’ intersecting lives and careers while celebrating New York’s grit and charm during the last great era of print journalism.\n\nBorn and raised in working-class New York City neighborhoods, Breslin and Hamill were products of fractured Irish-American families. They rose through the ranks of reporting without formal training or college degrees. Sometimes working on competing newspapers, and sometimes working on the same publication, they became good friends who challenged and inspired each other."
