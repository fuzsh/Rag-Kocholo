        "text": "The letter is written in a disciplined English teacher's hand.\n\nThe man about to retire and vacate room 417 at Sir Francis Drake\n\nHigh in San Anselmo, Calif., sent it to his son last April as \"a\n\nway of handing over a heart made glad.\" Here is what it's like\n\nto be in the autumn of one's life and encounter a spring like no\n\nother.\n\nI have an acute sense of things coming into life--green shoots,\n\nbuds, flowers I've planted, the birth process again, the rites\n\nof spring and so on. And of course it's bittersweet because,\n\nmuch as I love springtime, how many more springs will I be here\n\nto welcome so April-hearted? It's always bittersweet, the old\n\nturning world, 'spring forward,' ...the clouds, April showers\n\nand breezes of this wild vernal equinox and all. Just more\n\nbittersweet now and a bit less full of wild, exultant hope. But\n\nlovely beyond words, it is, still.\n\nOdd season, spring. To those immersed in basketball, spring\n\nusually marks an end, not a beginning. But for Cap Lavin, and\n\nfor his son, Steve--erstwhile coffee gofer, Forrest Mitty,\n\nWalter Gump and, thanks to the way his 1996-97 Bruins went\n\n(Steve's words here) \"from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to\n\nwithin 10 minutes of the Final Four,\" the latest resolution to\n\nthe persistent coaching melodramatics at UCLA--last spring\n\nmarked a beginning and an end.\n\nTransitions are like that. Cap had put in 43 years, most of them\n\nteaching Advanced Placement English with such dedication that\n\nhis retirement occasioned huge stories in both San Francisco\n\ndailies. Steve always wanted to be a basketball coach. The son\n\nnonetheless admired the integrity of the life his father had\n\nchosen--how through literature and philosophy Cap caught\n\nglimpses of things most people never paused to imagine. The two\n\nmight be walking down the street and come across a young woman\n\nin Birkenstocks and a batik skirt and a macrame tote bag that\n\nall but screamed Virginia Woolf paperback inside, and Steve\n\nwould throw Cap an affectionate elbow and say, \"Dad, look! A.P.\n\ntype!\"\n\nFor his part, Cap knew well Steve's devotion to \"this crazy,\n\ngraceful and rugged game,\" as the elder Lavin calls it, the game\n\nat which the father had starred and the son had done anything\n\nbut. Even though Cap played for two Hall of Fame coaches, Pete\n\nNewell and Phil Woolpert, at the University of San Francisco in\n\nthe late '40s and early '50s, he feared that a life in coaching\n\nwould box his son in. \"I thought the profession could be rote\n\nand boring,\" says Cap. Yet last March, when the NCAA tournament\n\nrolled around, there was Cap at UCLA's pregame warmups, a\n\n67-year-old retiree-to-be bounding past the security guards at\n\nThe Palace of Auburn Hills before the Bruins' first-round game\n\nagainst Charleston Southern, the teacher in him not to be\n\nsuppressed. \"Dad in his Florsheims,\" Steve says, recalling the\n\nsight, \"feeding Jelani McCoy in the post and fiddling with Toby\n\nBailey's shot.\"\n\nOnce, mentioning Cap to a certain previous occupant of the job\n\nSteve now holds, the son had made the mistake of referring to\n\nhis father as \"just an English teacher.\" Many years ago, at\n\nSouth Bend Central High, John Wooden, too, had been \"just an\n\nEnglish teacher.\" The legendary Bruins coach has forgiven Steve\n\nthe remark but never forgotten it. \"Coach Wooden has been brutal\n\never since,\" Steve says. \"The phone will ring and he'll say,\n\n'It's just the English teacher calling.'\"\n\nThe English-teacher influence is nonetheless clear. You can hear\n\nit in the many catchphrases that spill out of the younger\n\nLavin's mouth.\n\nThe Yankees of college basketball\n\nThose Nyquil nights where you stare wide-eyed at the ceiling\n\nGod writes straight with crooked lines\n\nNothing wrong with falling down as long as you get up\n\nIn the same boat, rowing to shore and praying to God\n\nFrom the bottom of the Grand Canyon to within 10 minutes of the\n\nFinal Four\n\nTwo weeks before last season began, UCLA fired Jim Harrick, the\n\ncoach who a year and a half earlier had guided the school to its\n\nfirst national championship since Wooden's retirement in 1975.\n\nSuddenly Lavin, then 32, found himself in charge of the Yankees\n\nof college basketball. Only the Bruins played like the '62 Mets.\n\nDown 28 with a minute left in the first half against Kansas on\n\nDec. 7, UCLA was booed off its own floor. There would be plenty\n\nmore of those Nyquil nights where you stare wide-eyed at the\n\nceiling, particularly after a 48-point loss at Stanford five\n\nweeks later, a game in which Lavin says the Cardinal \"sliced us\n\nup like a side of fries.\"\n\nBut God writes straight with crooked lines (a Portuguese proverb\n\nand Graham Greene epigraph, on loan from Cap). In telephone\n\ncalls, Wooden and Newell provided Lavin with guidance. There's\n\nnothing wrong with falling down as long as you get up, and\n\ndidn't the Bruins scramble to their feet at Cal a couple of days\n\nafter the Stanford debacle, winning by eight? Didn't they hoist\n\nthemselves up again by coming back from 16 down to beat Oregon,\n\nthen doing the same to win at Washington? When UCLA found itself\n\nlosing to Iowa State in the semifinals of the NCAA Midwest\n\nRegional, Lavin told the team, \"We're not down 16 yet--once\n\nwe're down 16 we'll be O.K.,\" and sure enough, next TV timeout,\n\nthey were down 16. \"Look, we're fine,\" Steve told the Bruins.\n\nJust stay in the same boat, rowing to shore and praying to God.\n\nAnd of course they came back to win that game, too.\n\n\"I look back at the Minnesota game, and I know the problem,\"\n\nLavin says, referring to the regional final in which the Bruins'\n\nseason came to an end. \"We never got down 16.\" UCLA had\n\nnonetheless finished 24-8, won a Pac-10 title and gone from the\n\nbottom of the Grand Canyon to within 10 minutes of the Final\n\nFour, an improbable perch given the team's 3-3 start.\n\n\"Lavisms,\" some of the Bruins players call these recurrent\n\ncatchphrases. They're not usually the Yeats couplets and\n\nHemingway excerpts and Aristotelian precepts in which Cap\n\ntraffics. But they result in the edification of the class just\n\nthe same. UCLA sports information director Marc Dellins, who has\n\nheard them all, just shakes his head and says, \"It was Homily\n\nCity here last season.\" Before Lavin, six other coaches had\n\ntried to succeed the Wizard of Westwood at UCLA, the University\n\nConstantly Looking Around. Several were disasters; none was an\n\nunqualified success. If catchphrases were what it took to\n\nfinally move UCLA basketball out from the shadow of a guy who\n\nwas just an English teacher, Lavin was happy to be the Wizard of\n\nHomily City.\n\nWooden has a thing for homilies himself, and he particularly\n\nlikes this one from Cervantes: The journey is better than the\n\nend. Says Lavin, \"My dad has always urged me to be\n\nprocess-oriented. It's the teacher in him--to be concerned with\n\nnot just the ends but the means. That it's O.K. to fail. I\n\nlearned more by failing last season than I had in nine years of\n\nobserving as an assistant coach.\"\n\nEver since college the father's great passion has been for the\n\nteachings of Aristotle: the imperative of balance, the golden\n\nmean. The son's credo is the greeting he put on his answering\n\nmachine when he was still an assistant driving a rattletrap\n\nToyota and up to his coccyx in debt: \"Stay in your stance!\"\n\nFunny that father and son thought they'd chosen different\n\nfields. Turns out they wound up devoting their lives to the same\n\nthing.\n\nThe San Francisco that raised Albert (Cap) Lavin was a Herb Caen\n\ncolumn sprung to life, a big city with a small town's soul,\n\nwhere a kid could grow up quickly but safely. So long as the day\n\nhad light, there would be a pickup game at Rochambeau\n\nPlayground, just steps from the house in the Richmond district\n\nwhere Cap lived with his mom, who was separated from his father.\n\nCome nightfall he might slip into a North Beach jazz club,\n\ncurious to know where each solo flight from a Diz or a Monk or a\n\nBird might come to rest. He and his buddies acted as if they ran\n\nthe town, an attitude that in the case of one of them, future\n\nmayor George Moscone, would turn out to be justified. Throughout\n\nthey partook of the spirit of what Cap calls \"a place that makes\n\nyou feel like who you are.\"\n\nAt St. Ignatius, the gemstone of the city's parochial high\n\nschools, Cap made his name as a basketball player, a guard cited\n\nas \"player of the decade\" for the '40s when he was inducted into\n\nthe San Francisco Prep Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. The\n\npapers called him Capricious Cappy for the way he would whip a\n\npass through his legs to the teammate who least expected it. But\n\nat St. Ignatius he also immersed himself in books, and this\n\nlanky kid with the rapscallion streak was drawn to the rigor of\n\nthe priests' approach to life and learning. There was something\n\nchallenging about the Jesuit way--\"something,\" Cap says, \"to go\n\nup against.\" He had been raised in a Unitarian home, but as a\n\nsophomore at San Francisco, a Jesuit university, he became a\n\nCatholic.\n\nHe was named captain of the Dons as a senior, but a herniated\n\ndisk forced him to sit out that '51-52 season and ultimately to\n\nspurn an approach from the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers. \"It was\n\nhard to coach somebody who was more intelligent than you were,\"\n\nNewell once said of Cap. The young man might have gone on to do\n\ngraduate work in philosophy, but he and his new bride, Mary, had\n\na kid on the way. In 1954 Cap took a job teaching English at San\n\nFrancisco's Riordan High, coaching the school's basketball team\n\non the side. Four years later, with three kids now, the Lavins\n\nmoved to Marin County. Cap, teaching at Drake High, gave up the\n\nbench in 1959 to become head of the English department.\n\nThere was a vastness to the world that he wanted to honor, not\n\nonly at this school named after an explorer but also in the\n\nhouse where he and Mary were raising what would soon be two\n\ngirls and four boys. Cap's biggest fear was that his kids would\n\nbecome what he called \"cherries,\" just more overripe produce\n\nfrom Marin County, which by the '70s would acquire a\n\nnot-undeserved reputation as the epicenter of narcissism. \"He\n\nthought the suburbs were like Disneyland,\" says his son. \"No\n\ngarbage in the streets. Nothing but peacock feathers and hot\n\ntubs.\"\n\nSo Cap did everything he could to expose his kids to the same\n\nrange of culture he had experienced when he was young. If Steve\n\nand his five older siblings wanted to watch The Partridge\n\nFamily, the TV would get tuned to Alistair Cooke. Even before\n\nSteve could read subtitles, he was being dragged across the\n\nbridge to the cinematheques for films by Cocteau. Cap would dump\n\nthe kids at Rochambeau, now a mosaic of ethnicity, for the\n\nafternoon; or take them to the Legion of Honor to ponder Rodin's\n\nThe Thinker; or drag them to the Sunset district for what Cap\n\ncalls \"Hopper time, to see the shadows come.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Lavin home became a salon for teachers, clerics,\n\nauthors and politicians, including Moscone, until he was\n\nassassinated in office in 1978. \"As the baby, Steve was always\n\naround older people and was treated like an adult sooner,\" says\n\nRachel Lavin Moore, who is Cap and Mary's eldest. \"He was\n\nhearing discussions of things I never heard discussed.\"\n\nBut there were two differences between father and son. Steve\n\nsuffered from dyslexia, which kept him from making companions of\n\nbooks the way Cap did. The other difference was Steve's aptitude\n\nfor playing the game. Basketball didn't come easy to the son,\n\nwho was as \"short, thick-legged and slow,\" in Steve's words, as\n\nhis father had been lean, graceful and quick. In 1984, as a\n\n19-year-old sophomore at San Francisco, Steve told his dad he\n\nwanted to make basketball his life, but as a coach.\n\nNone of Cap's kids had followed him into a life of the mind, and\n\nhere was the last of his issue, a boy with good critical\n\nfaculties and a knack for absorbing and assimilating\n\ninformation, choosing a world that could fit on a clipboard. \"I\n\ndidn't oppose his choice,\" Cap says, \"but I did tell him,\n\n'You're still in college, keep exploring.' In the course of the\n\nconversation we both felt strong emotions. But by the time it\n\nwas over, we both knew what his vocation was, and why.\"\n\n\"He meant to challenge me, to see if I really had the passion to\n\nbring something different to the game,\" Steve remembers. That\n\nsummer they created a laboratory in which to find out: the Lavin\n\nBasketball Camps, which now attract 2,000 boys and girls each\n\nsummer at several locations in the Bay Area. The English\n\nteacher's son also began writing letters, seeking advice. He\n\nwrote Newell and Woolpert, of course, but he also wrote active\n\ncoaches whom he admired, particularly those who emphasized\n\ndefense, such as Purdue's Gene Keady, Indiana's Bob Knight,\n\nDuke's Mike Krzyzewski and UNLV's Jerry Tarkanian.\n\nIn 1988, when Steve was finishing college at Chapman in Orange,\n\nCalif., he got letters back. Both Knight and Keady invited him\n\nto spend his intersession break observing their programs.\n\n(Another Lavism: If you want to soar with the eagles, you've got\n\nto go where the eagles soar.) For six weeks at the height of the\n\nBig Ten season he bunked with student managers and players,\n\neyeballing practices and helping break down film, learning all\n\nsorts of things, among them that this was absolutely what he\n\nwanted to do. \"To go to Bob Knight and Gene Keady takes humility\n\nand boldness,\" his father says. \"Most people don't have that\n\ncombination.\"\n\nKeady and Knight were impressed enough to let Lavin return in\n\nthe summer as a volunteer counselor at their camps, and Keady\n\nhired him as a graduate assistant the following fall. Thus began\n\nnearly a decade of penury: Two years as a grad assistant at\n\nPurdue. A third year there as a volunteer assistant (he made\n\nends meet by taking out loans and accepting free salad-bar\n\ncoupons from a friend of Keady's who owned a Wendy's). In 1991\n\nHarrick offered Lavin the same job at UCLA, where he spent three\n\nmore years in poverty before moving up a notch to\n\nrestricted-earnings coach, which paid $16,000 a year. Not until\n\nthe 1995-96 season did he become a full-fledged assistant.\n\nCoach Lav, the \"cream-and-sugar guy\" whom Harrick counted on to\n\nfetch coffee, was more than $70,000 in debt on Nov. 6, 1996,\n\nwhen UCLA fired his boss, primarily for falsifying an expense\n\nreport and repeatedly lying when confronted about it. Lavin\n\nlucked out every which way: Harrick's top assistant, Lorenzo\n\nRomar, had taken the Pepperdine job nine months earlier, and\n\nanother experienced aide, Mark Gottfried, had left before that\n\nfor Murray State. So Lavin was handed the Bruins job, albeit\n\nwith no guarantees other than if the school hired someone else\n\non a permanent basis--which it seemed all but sure to do--he\n\nwould be kept on as an assistant.\n\nJust hours before learning of his new assignment, Lavin had had\n\nlunch with Newell. That evening, after the extraordinary events\n\nof the day, he took a phone call from Wooden. Don't worry about\n\nwhether you'll get the job full time, the old coach told him,\n\nand set aside what just happened to your boss. \"You don't want\n\none foot in tomorrow and one foot in yesterday,\" Wooden said.\n\n\"Keep both feet in today, and you'll get to tomorrow.\" Lavin\n\nowed it not just to himself, but to his team, to stay in his\n\nstance.\n\n\"I'm like a terrorist,\" Lavin told the players before the season\n\nbegan. \"You don't know what to expect from me, and I've got\n\nnothing to lose.\" He started three lineups over the first 10\n\ngames. For being late, talking back in practice and breaking\n\ncurfew, misdemeanors that went largely unpunished under Harrick,\n\nLavin benched three starters. Six games into the season, with a\n\nmediocre 3-3 record, he began phasing out the offense that UCLA\n\nhad used almost without interruption since the beginning of the\n\nWooden era: the high-post set, a sequence of precise passes that\n\nusually led to midrange jump shots.\n\nThe attack he installed, the motion offense, would ultimately\n\nflatter a team that couldn't sink a midrange jump shot to save\n\nits life and wasn't much better at threading a pass from here to\n\nthere but could move and slash to the hoop. But first came those\n\nembarrassing losses. Amazingly (for this was UCLA), they didn't\n\nseem to matter. Calls, letters and E-mail coming into the\n\nathletic department praised Lavin's body language on the bench\n\nand his efforts to discipline the team. On talk radio the\n\nkibitzers remarked on how the players were no longer talking\n\ntrash and questioning calls and were suddenly sprinting to the\n\nsideline for timeouts. Fans and boosters loved the way Lavin\n\nposted his 23 \"expectations\" (he refused to call them rules) and\n\nsat down starters even though he had virtually no reserves.\n\nWhile players had given Harrick lip with impunity, so much as a\n\npeep and Lavin had everyone running 17s, the despised sprint\n\ndrill that requires touching 17 sidelines in a minute.\n\nDespite slicked-back hair that made him look literally wet\n\nbehind the ears, Lavin seemed to be a turnbuckle between the\n\ngenerations--\"a young old-timer,\" as Krzyzewski has called him.\n\nHarrick had delivered the very thing that was supposed to sate\n\nthese people, an NCAA title, and had gone unloved; here was\n\nLavin, sitting down his best players, and the boosters and\n\nalumni only wanted to give that boy the job permanently. He had\n\nstayed in his stance and done right by the old school.\n\n\"If I'm trying to help you achieve a certain level as an athlete\n\nand a person, I have to hold you accountable,\" Lavin says. \"If I\n\ndon't, I shouldn't be coaching at UCLA. After some time the\n\nplayers realized I wasn't just concerned with winning the game.\n\nI wasn't just concerned with the end.\"\n\nAs brave as that sounds, each loss in late January and early\n\nFebruary tested Lavin's faith that he would be kept on. But his\n\ngirlfriend, Treena Camacho, worked in the athletic department,\n\nand she answered the phone and saw the mail. She sensed that\n\ndirector of athletics Peter Dalis could see that the train was\n\nleaving the station, and he wanted to book a seat. \"Anytime\n\nSteve wants to sit all his starters down, for the right reason,\n\nand we lose a basketball game, it's all right with me,\" Dalis\n\nsaid on Feb. 11, when he announced that Lavin would be UCLA's\n\npermanent coach.\n\nOf course it was important where the journey ended--that the\n\nBruins won. But in Westwood, suddenly, attention was being paid\n\nto the trip itself. Lavin would drag the team on outings to\n\nhomeless shelters and children's hospitals. He would keep a bowl\n\nin his office stocked with candy bars, to lure his guys into\n\nstopping by during the day. There was a place for laughter, too,\n\neven at Stanford. Watching the Cardinal pick off pass after lazy\n\npass during its Jan. 9 rout of the Bruins, Cap had risen from\n\nhis seat behind the UCLA bench, unable to abide the spectacle\n\nany longer. \"C'mon, guys!\" he screamed. \"You've gotta crow-hop\n\nto meet those passes!\"\n\nHearing him, Steve nearly broke up, less at the old-time hoops\n\nlingo than at Cap actually thinking he had a solution for what\n\nwas unfolding before them. \"Dad,\" he said, wheeling around,\n\n\"we've got to do a lot of things. I mean, what are we down, 60?\"\n\nOn Feb. 8, in their last game before Lavin got the job for good,\n\nthe Bruins put a 19-point hurt on the french fry chefs from Palo\n\nAlto in a rematch at Pauley Pavilion, and they didn't lose again\n\nuntil the NCAA regional final, a streak of 12 wins. Losing by 48\n\nto Stanford had been O.K. because--all hail process!--there's\n\nnothing wrong with falling down as long as you get up. The\n\nequivalent Capism is from A Farewell to Arms: \"All of us are\n\nbroken by life, but those who survive are strongest at the\n\nmended places.\"\n\nSure isn't \"rote and boring,\" this college basketball coaching\n\nbusiness. During the off-season, through no apparent fault of\n\nthe school, UCLA lost a top recruit, Schea Cotton, when the NCAA\n\ndisallowed his standardized test score, ruling that he had been\n\nimproperly granted an accommodation for a learning disability.\n\nThen two projected starters, McCoy and Kris Johnson, were\n\nsuspended indefinitely for breaking team rules. According to\n\npublished reports, both players tested positive for marijuana.\n\nFinally Lavin himself seemed to get up out of his stance. Even\n\nthough Dalis had publicly given him the job back in February,\n\nLavin had never signed a contract. To the four-year,\n\n$400,000-per-annum package that Dalis had tendered, Lavin wanted\n\nto add a year and more money. In July, Lavin asked a friend to\n\nlook over the contract. The friend happened to be a member of\n\nthe most reviled species in college sports, an agent: Arn\n\nTellem, whose clients include Albert Belle of the Chicago White\n\nSox and Isaiah Rider of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nIn Lavin's mind his demands weren't unreasonable. \"Six different\n\ncoaches in 21 years isn't a record of stability,\" he says.\n\nHaving recruited well, and riding a wave of postseason good\n\nfeeling, he succeeded in signing a new contract for at least\n\n$2.3 million over five years. But according to the Long Beach\n\nPress-Telegram, irritation with Lavin in UCLA's corridors of\n\npower was \"the worst-kept secret of the fall.\" Dalis, a\n\nremorseless institutional politician and old-school AD, was said\n\nto be seething.\n\nDalis denies this. He says it was his idea that Lavin hire a\n\nlawyer, to make sure he understood the school's contract. Lavin\n\ndisputes any notion that \"I've changed and I've hired this\n\nsuperagent and I want to create this Pitino-Calipari persona and\n\nthere's some big rift in the athletic department.\"\n\nBut more than a decade had passed since Lavin received the\n\nfollowing advice from one of the elders whose counsel he has\n\nsought. \"Money has corrupted the coaching profession,\" Newell\n\nwrote to him back in 1986. \"Coaches today, with their salaries,\n\nshoe contracts, summer camps, radio and TV shows, are in the\n\n$200,000-a-year bracket--some well above that figure. What this\n\nsimply means is that the coach acquaints himself and his family\n\nto a lifestyle that says 'win or else,' so he does what he has\n\nto do to win.... Being able to live comfortably with yourself\n\nand know you have helped other people is more important than\n\nfame or money.\"\n\nThis fall, freshly turned 33, Lavin spent a Nyquil night\n\nworrying about the prospect of another season begun in crisis.\n\nSo he clicked on the TV and happened upon a documentary on Harry\n\nTruman. \"He was a complete failure until age 33,\" Steve says.\n\n\"But his entire presidency was crisis management. Real crisis\n\nmanagement. When all that's happened is you've lost three of\n\nyour top six players, you realize everything's relative.\"\n\nLooking on from retirement, Cap scarcely recognizes himself in\n\nthe way his son relates to the game. \"There's a naive and\n\nbeautiful way he loves sports, while I can get ironic and\n\nsarcastic,\" he says. Nor does he see in Steve much of Newell or\n\nWoolpert, who quit coaching at ages 44 and 54, respectively.\n\n\"They argued all the time, chewing their towels. I think Steve\n\nhas more fun.\"\n\nOften Cap thinks back to his conversation with Steve 13 years\n\nago, the one that was equal parts challenge and discussion, as\n\nthe best learning situations so often are. \"He was absolutely\n\nright,\" Cap says of that day when the son persuaded the father\n\nthat a teacher of anything, and certainly one of this crazy,\n\ngraceful and rugged game, needn't be constrained by limits.\n\n\"Steve took to heart that coaching is teaching, only instead of\n\na blackboard you have a backboard. He found his own way to all\n\nsorts of things that are universal in the game and as rich as\n\nliterature and philosophy.\"\n\nLast April, not long before undergoing a successful heart\n\nbypass, Cap wrote Steve these words:\n\nYou chose a career in the game I have been deeply in love with\n\nsince 1939, nearly 60 years of experience.... If you decide you\n\nwant to stay with it a good long while, say 'til 2039...that's\n\na hundred years between us.... Like me, you're built to go a\n\nlong arc.\n\nTwo long arcs, one in descent, the other just ascending. Only\n\nthere's a trick to these long arcs. Gotta stay in your stance,\n\nSteve. Stay in your stance!\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY JOHN W.
