        "text": "Monday, January 6, 1997\n\nPsychic outlook for 1997 Bruins\n\nPREDICTIONS:\n\nWill the skinny white jackass be chancellor, head USAC?\n\nWell, here we are, Bruins Â­ the first Viewpoint column of\n\nWinter quarter.\n\nDid you miss me? (I missed you.) It’s a great privilege for me\n\nto be able to write this, the first Viewpoint column of 1997,\n\nespecially since (as I’m sure you all recall) I was the final\n\ncolumnist to write in 1996 (Thursday of Dead Week).\n\nOur Viewpoint editors have requested that we as columnists limit\n\nthe senseless column-opening ramblings that I feel at least partly\n\nresponsible for popularizing last Fall quarter, and I would again\n\nlike to set a precedent this quarter by limiting my ramblings.\n\nHaving said that, I would be remiss if I began my list of\n\npsychic predictions for UCLA 1997 without first giving a warm\n\nwelcome to all of our new friends, the Winter Bruins. Come on, you\n\nknow one. Maybe you yourself were one once. Maybe you’re one now.\n\nIn any case, welcome. Please allow me to be the first to welcome\n\nyou to the little community we call UCLA. I hope you enjoy your\n\nstay.\n\nAnd now, as promised, Justin Horey’s Psychic Predictions for\n\nUCLA 1997.\n\nJANUARY: A riot breaks out in Westwood Plaza when it becomes\n\nclear that observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day will prevent\n\nmy column from running as scheduled on Monday of third week. I\n\nissue a press release urging the demonstrators to return the head\n\nof the Joe Bruin statue, and Viewpoint (reluctantly) runs a special\n\n1/2 page section entitled \"The Best of the Skinny White\n\nJackass.\"\n\nFEBRUARY: As news that I am unattached leaks out to the student\n\nbody, Viewpoint is overwhelmed by the record number of letters,\n\nfaxes and e-mails from female students who propose marriage to me\n\non Valentine’s Day. I am instructed by Viewpoint editor Geoff\n\nMartin to \"find a way to decrease your sex appeal or find another\n\nvolunteer position.\"\n\nMARCH: The UCLA men’s basketball team loses to Pepperdine\n\nUniversity (lead by former Bruin assistant coach Lorenzo Romar) in\n\nthe first round of the NCAA tournament, and Steve Lavin is\n\nsubsequently fired for being \"an all-around lousy excuse for a\n\ncoach.\"\n\nHaving been recently fired from Viewpoint for being unable to\n\nlower my aforementioned sex appeal, I am named the next head coach\n\nof the UCLA men’s basketball team.\n\nAPRIL: The basketball team refuses to recognize me as coach, and\n\nfollowing a much publicized coup led by second-string point guard\n\nBrandon Loyd, the team chooses Tickle Me Elmo as their new leader.\n\nMy presidential campaign is unaffected by the negative press, and I\n\nshrewdly avoid the unemployment line when I am elected USAC\n\npresident by \"the largest margin since the UCLA-Princeton\n\ngame.\"\n\nMAY: As Charles Young’s last day as chancellor nears, the\n\nuniversity offers me a large undisclosed sum (although the Daily\n\nBruin reports it to be of \"Letterman-esque proportions\") to take\n\nover the position. I am officially named the new chancellor on May\n\n29 (my birthday), and I immediately request that I be addressed as\n\n\"Chancellor-elect Horey.\"\n\nJUNE: In my first day as chancellor, I pass a bill that\n\nofficially re-names the Towell tent after Steve Lavin. Later that\n\nday, the university announces that the building will be demolished\n\nbefore the end of the month.\n\nJULY: After serving only days as chancellor, I take off to\n\nvacation in Amsterdam where I hope to see historic sites, including\n\nThe Eddie Van Halen Birthplace and Library.\n\nWhile in the Netherlands I meet a woman claiming to be the real\n\nURSA. We are married that same afternoon.\n\nAUGUST: URSA and I return to the states (and the UCLA campus)\n\nwhere we purchase matching \"His and Hers\" Acura Integras. We have\n\nour cars lowered and replace the standard white headlights with\n\n(you guessed it) blue and gold ones. One student remarks that \"it’s\n\nabout time we got a chancellor who’s so in tune with what students\n\nare into.\" He is then expelled for ending his sentence with a\n\npreposition.\n\nSEPTEMBER: When news of my marriage to URSA reaches the student\n\npopulation, the university asks for my resignation, citing \"a\n\nconflict of interest.\" I am, however, able to maintain my position\n\nas USAC president, and having time to focus my energies on USAC, I\n\norganize a wrestling match between the New Joe and the Old Joe\n\nBruin mascots in Pauley Pavilion for Welcome Week. Many first-year\n\nstudents are disturbed by the event, and one anonymous student\n\ndescribes me as \"a sick, sick, Old Joe-loving bastard.\" Undaunted,\n\nOld Joe prevails, and regains his job as UCLA mascot.\n\nAs an added bonus, Old Joe is also named the new head coach of\n\nthe Bruin football team.\n\nOCTOBER: A media frenzy/controversy explodes when I dress as\n\nTickle Me Elmo for Halloween and demand that each student \"stop by\n\nto give the former chancellor a tickle.\" Needless to say, this\n\nbrings to an end my term as USAC president.\n\nNOVEMBER: Despite the events of the previous months, URSA and I\n\nare elected king and queen of the homecoming court. Viewpoint\n\npleads for my return, but I laugh, opting instead to take a\n\nposition writing for The Turtle. One letter to the editor in The\n\nBruin reads, \"Won’t you come home, Skinny White Jackass?\"\n\nDECEMBER: Under the leadership of Old Joe, the Bruin football\n\nteam prepares for the Rose Bowl, where more than one drunken fan\n\nnotes that \"the new UCLA coach is one hairy S.O.B.\""
