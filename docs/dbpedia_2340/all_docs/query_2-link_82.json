Kobe was a high school senior in 1995/96. So his Soph year was 93/94. Steve Lavin wasn't yet a full time assistant coach at UCLA (not allowed to recruit by NCAA rules), let alone a head coach.\n\nUCLA did show token Kobe interest - Lorenzo Romar ;and Mark Gottfried were the Harrick assistants on him. But UCLA in those days didn't wander too far from the West Coast in recruiting. The 95 title team had only 3 non-west coast players - Euro center Jiri Zidek, Texas born nigerian backup center Ike Nawankwo, and reserve PG Cameron Dollar out of Georgia (by way of Prep School in Maryland). The rest - Ed O'Bannon, Charles O'Bannon, Tyus Edney, Toby Bailey, JR Henderson, Kris Johnson, Marquis Burns & Kevin Dempsey were all from California, and o'mmA Givens was from Washington State.\n\nHard to believe just 16 years ago was a different era....\n\nLike a lot of top pros, Kobe has worked with and is friends with Rico Hines. Most likely that's the reason for his appearance....\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/STJ_Basketball/status/109619992579936257\n\nhttp://instagr.am/p/L7Yj6/\n\nDid Lavin recruit Kobe back in the day?\n\nMost schools were on Kobe from his frosh HS year on - mos ceraintly by his soph year.
