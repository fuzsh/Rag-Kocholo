He leaves his wife of 31 years, Mary (Sheridan) Lavin, his father Leo M. Lavin, Sr., his children Ken Henneberry, Maura Bettez and Kristen Lavin, grandchildren Liam and Owen Henneberry, and his sisters Beth DePasquale and Jean Ferreira. Leo was born September 11, 1954 in Worcester, son of the late Marie Paule (Girard) and Leo M. Lavin Sr. His roots were in Grafton, he graduated from Grafton High School in 1972.
