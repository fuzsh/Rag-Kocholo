        "text": "We've been hearing it for 30 years.\n\nWhy can't St. John's be as good as it was back in the day?\n\nYou know the St. John's in the public imagination. Chris Mullin burying jumpers. Bill Wennington grabbing rebounds. Walter Berry blocking shots and scoring. Mark Jackson running the point. Lou Carnesecca pushing all the right buttons.\n\nIt's 1985 forever in many people's minds. Nothing else will measure up.\n\nWhich is a shame. Because Steve Lavin has built something pretty special, against all odds, at St. John's in 2015.\n\n\"I'm a realist,\" Lavin said in a phone interview this week. \"So when we took over in 2010 I was well aware we had a long haul. But it's been an even more arduous undertaking than I anticipated.\"\n\nHow could it be otherwise? Lavin took the reins in 2010 and led a recruiting class assembled by his predecessor, Norm Roberts, where Roberts never took them: the NCAA tournament.\n\nAnd then it was time to start again. Lavin recruited and built into these headwinds: three university presidents, the disintegration of the old Big East Conference, a year-long battle with prostate cancer and the loss of his father, his close friend and mentor.\n\nAnd all this while playing in the shadow of that trip to the Final Four in 1985. Lavin's office is adjacent to Carnesecca Arena.\n\n\"It's natural to be nostalgic,\" Lavin said. \"I was raised to appreciate history and the origins of things. My folks were part of the Greatest Generation — shaped by The Depression and World War II. They raised us on the Marx Brothers, Benny Goodman, Bobby Short and (Frank) Sinatra. Yet it's important to live in the present — I'm an optimist that operates in a pragmatic way — (and) realism and optimism can coexist. It's important to know who we are and where we want to go.\"\n\nEven the comparison to 1985 is hazy, and unfair, particularly to the success from Lavin and building a program from the ground up.\n\nNotice every coach who has succeeded Carnesecca. Brian Mahoney, out after four difficult years. Fran Fraschilla, two years and out. Mike Jarvis, success on the court but scandal-plagued off it at a university that cares about such things. Roberts, a good man who couldn't bring top-flight recruits to Queens.\n\nAnd no wonder: The university isn't spending on athletics, relative to peers, the way it was in 1985. The game has changed. St.John's might be in a power conference with a pedigreed coach in Lavin, but the challenge is exponentially harder than it was in Louie's heyday.\n\nEven so, compare Carnesecca's last five seasons — three 20-win seasons, one trip into the second weekend of the NCAA tournament — with Lavin's first five — three 20-win seasons, a second NCAA bid looming, and a sense that this group can make noise in the NCAA tournament again.\n\nCarnesecca's last five years came on the heels of 1985. Lavin's came 25 years later, after many others had failed.\n\nSo when Lavin is held up to scrutiny and judged to be wanting, who exactly are we comparing him to?\n\nWinning is a lagging indicator in any program, and so it has been for Lavin's Red Storm, but the progress is evident in that column as well: 13 wins in Year 2, after nine seniors left and Lavin missed all but four games of the season with prostate cancer; 17 wins in Year 3; 20 last year; 21 and counting in 2014-15 heading into a Big East tournament playing as well as anyone else in the league, save Villanova.\n\nAt the same time, Lavin has produced consistent enough results on the recruiting trail that absent academic qualifier issues, such as those of Norvel Pelle, and early defections to the NBA from Maurice Harkless and JaKarr Sampson, St. John's has a group capable of putting a scare into NCAA tournament teams this month.\n\nA pair of consensus top-10 national recruiting classes and elite recruits such as Rysheed Jordan will do that for a program.\n\nLavin, too, has made certain that the gains aren't ephemeral the way they were under Jarvis. His nine seniors who exhausted eligibility have graduated. When star guard D'Angelo Harrison struggled early in his career with discipline issues, Lavin suspended him but also made sure to continue cultivating him. When Harrison returned, he became a team leader, a big reason why St. John's is so dangerous.\n\nYet when St. John's beat a strong Georgetown team at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 28 — 13,615 fans could be forgiven for Carnesecca-era flashbacks — Harrison didn't score until less than eight minutes remained in the game. By the time he did, St.John's led 66-50.\n\n\"This season, and these seniors play a big part in it,\" Lavin said when asked him if St. John's felt like the right fit for him at this point. \"In those darker moments, when you've gotten off to a 1-4 start or an 0-5 (Big East) start last year, and it's crickets other than your family or your former players and a handful of legit friends. At those moments, that's the magical part of staying on task, coaching and teaching kids you love.\n\n\"It recharges the batteries and reminds you why you got in the business.\"\n\nSo there's undeniable satisfaction in not only reaching his goals this season, but doing so with these players — Harrison, endlessly useful Sir'Dominic Pointer, ultimate New York player showing all-out effort and toughness (though Chicago-born) Phil Greene IV, shot-blocking extraordinaire Chris Obekpa and Jordan, with his next-level potential.\n\nLavin hasn't been given a contract extension — a virtual invitation to other coaches to cast doubt on his long-term prospects at St. John's — but the tide of public opinion should be too strong for the university to ignore, especially if St. John's can punctuate this strong season with March wins.\n\nHe has already landed a top-50 recruit for next year in guard Brandon Sampson, and those who doubt Lavin's ability to add to that class are ignoring his history at St.John's.\n\nThis year, Lavin's team jumped to an 11-1 start, the program's best since 1985-86 — the year after Carnesecca took the Red Storm to the Final Four. Then they lost three in a row. Lavin wrote this to his players at the time: \"It's how one responds to tough times that matters most. That is a timeless truth. Better weeks are ahead of us!\"\n\nLavin was right. It's time to appreciate the St. John's of the present, with a future that looks promising.\n\n\"I'm proud and pleased where we are,\" Lavin said. \"But I'm hungry for more.\""
