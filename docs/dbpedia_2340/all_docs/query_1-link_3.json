        "text": "American BMX rider and television host (born 1976)\n\nThomas Joseph Lavin (born December 7, 1976) is an American BMX cyclist and the host of MTV's reality competition series The Challenge since its eleventh season.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas Joseph Lavin was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lavin first began to ride bikes when he was two. He eventually became a professional winning his first pro contest at the age of nineteen.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nBMX\n\n[edit]\n\nHe has entered events including the X Games and the Dew Tour. In the X Games he took bronze three times, silver once, and gold three times (One was Australian). He has been a DK Dirt Circuit Champion, a champion in the Gravity Games, a European championship winner, and a CFB Champion. In 1995, he was crowned the \"King of Dirt.\" He has a 1-acre (0.40 ha) BMX track in his backyard which includes several groomed trails and dirt jumps.[2]\n\nLavin was competing in a Dew Tour event in Las Vegas on October 14, 2010, where he crashed and was rushed to the hospital. Due to the critical injuries he sustained, he was put into a medically induced coma and developed a case of pneumonia shortly after.[3][4] On October 20, Chas Aday, friend of Lavin, reported that Lavin was breathing on his own, following simple commands like squeezing hands or giving thumbs-up to the doctors and he was expected to make a full recovery.[5] Lavin was able to return home on November 16, 2010.[6]\n\nAccording to Bleacher Report he is considered one of the greatest BMX riders of all time.[7]\n\nLavin was included into the USA BMX Hall of Fame on October 29, 2022 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA.

Stephen crashed during the Dew Action Sports Tour in Baltimore. He suffered a serious spinal injury during a double-backflip attempt on June 22, 2007. All sales from the single were donated to the Stephen Murray Family Fund.[2][8][7]\n\nMTV\n\n[edit]\n\nLavin is the subject of the film A Film about T. J. Lavin. He appeared on an episode of MTV's Cribs.[9]\n\nHe has hosted spin-offs, specials, and MTV's reality-competition show The Challenge (originally titled Real World/Road Rules Challenge) since its eleventh season.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe married his longtime girlfriend Roxanne Siordia on November 2, 2012, in Las Vegas. The couple had been together for eight years and married on their anniversary. Through Siordia, Lavin has one stepdaughter, whom he has since adopted.[10]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2002, 2021 MTV Cribs Himself Season 6, episode 6; season 18, episode 1 2005–present The Challenge Host Season 11–present 2010 Spring Break Challenge 5 episodes 2021–present The Challenge: All Stars Season 1–present 2022–present The Challenge: USA Season 1–present 2023 The Challenge: World Championship 12 episodes\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
