        "text": "Eyemart Express has opened a store in Rogers, giving the discount glasses retailer its fourth Arkansas location.\n\nThe 3,506-square-foot store is at 2600 W. Pleasant Crossing Drive east of Interstate 49, in a shopping center anchored by a Walmart Supercenter. The company did not disclose lease terms. Other tenants in the retail development are Mattress Firm, Moe’s Southwest Grill and Supercuts.\n\nThe store will create about 10 new jobs, the company said in a news release. It also features an onsite lab so 90% of glasses can be ordered and received on the same day — some in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nEyemart Express carries discount options and name-brand glasses from makers such as Ray-Ban, Gucci and Fendi. The company has more than 200 stores in 38 states.\n\nThe Texas-based company’s other Arkansas stores are in Fayetteville, Fort Smith and Jonesboro."
