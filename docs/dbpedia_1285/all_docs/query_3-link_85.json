        "text": "Doug Barnes Jr. just launched new plan of attack in the hotly contested world of eyeglasses. He’s setting up shop in the walkways of major malls.\n\nBarnes has opened DB Vision “kiosks” — 10-by-10-foot eyewear booths — in Stonebriar Centre mall, North East Mall, Grapevine Mills and the Parks at Arlington, hoping for a cheap entry into major metro markets, beginning with Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nThe “stores” cost $30,000 to open, take only one optician to operate and need to sell only two to three pairs a day to break even.\n\nYou have to bring in your prescription. There’s no doctor to examine your eyes. The prescription, measurements and frame order are electronically sent to the manufacturer in Asia. Once the glasses are made, they’re shipped to the company’s lab for final make-ready and then mailed to customers. The turnaround time is typically a week to 10 days.\n\nThere’s another twist: The kiosks feature digital lenses that are being heralded as the prescription eyeglass industry’s equivalent of HDTV. Only about 1 percent of U.S. eyeglasses have these lenses, which offer greater clarity and less undulation, because their significantly higher prices have been a deterrent. Barnes wants to change that.\n\nHis digitals are $199 for single vision, including a designer frame, and $299 for progressives. A complete pair of conventional lens glasses costs $99 for single-vision and $199 for no-line bifocals.\n\n“We’re trying to cut out all the games,” says Barnes at the company headquarters and lab in Farmers Branch. “Everything for us is included — the lenses, the coatings, the warranty, the frames. We’ve got Coach, Nike, Calvin Klein, Harley-Davidson, Candies and Flexon — the memory metal that’s practically indestructible.”\n\nDB Vision is the newborn sister of Eyemart Express Ltd., the nation’s seventh-largest optical chain, founded 21 years ago by Doug Barnes Sr. Last year, Eyemart, owned by the Barnes family, posted sales of $200 million from 133 stores in 31 states. But the Eyemart Express closest to the Dallas area is in Sherman. That’s because the low-cost model works best in smaller cities where it doesn’t take enormous advertising support.\n\n“Because of the sheer size of Dallas-Fort Worth, we would have to build eight to nine traditional stores to cover about $100,000 a month in advertising,” says Doug Jr., chief operating officer and chief technology officer of both companies. “We can open 20 to 25 of these things for the cost of one Eyemart store.”\n\nHe and his dad like the idea of remaining a zero-debt company. And going out on a retail limb is nothing new to them.\n\nDoug Sr., a 64-year-old doctor of optometry, is credited as a pioneer of one-hour, value-priced eyewear in 1984 when he opened Vision Express in Louisville, Ky. Three years later, Dallas-based Pearle Vision bought his 27-store chain for $50 million. He moved his family of four here because he had an employment contract with Pearle.\n\nIn 1990, Barnes bought out his noncompete agreement, founded Eyemart and opened his first store in Appleton, Wis. — a warehouse setup with frames displayed in cardboard trays on folding tables. Today’s sleek stores are near retail hubs. They have independent doctors of optometry next door and one-hour labs inside.\n\nA GED millionaire\n\nDoug Jr., who has his GED, left Shepton High School in Plano when he was 16 to take a $52,000 job with Ion Storm, a video game company in downtown Dallas. He helped start a software company, 10k Wizard, which was sold to Morning Star, making him a 20-something millionaire in his own right.\n\nHis father persuaded him to join the family business at 23. As preparation, the boss’ son went to work for competitors LensCrafters and EyeMasters, and then Eyemart — using his first name, Harry, for his version of Undercover Boss.\n\n“I’ve always had trouble sleeping, so I work and I program,” says Doug Jr. “When I was in the field, I decided to rewrite all our computer systems. We now have our own technology development team.”\n\nThat team created an unmanned eyewear unit that’s being tested by Rite Aid Corp. and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Customers can try on 72 frames (tethered by a pull-string), enter their prescription information on a touch screen, have their eyes and facial measurements taken with a webcam, and electronically submit their orders.\n\nThe manufacturing and delivery process is the same as glasses ordered at the mall kiosks or online through the company’s website.\n\nChelsea Wildman, who oversees the eye-care category for Rite Aid, thinks it’s neat. “You’re buying glasses and contacts from basically a vending machine.”\n\nShe particularly likes the option that allows customers to pick out four frames that are mailed to their homes so that they can try them on, select the best, and return them via pre-paid postage — like Netflix for eyeglasses. “You send them back within five days, and they send you your real glasses within 10 days,” she says.\n\nRite Aid has six units set up (the first went in June 15) with plans for six more as part of an eye-care “island” where all things eye-related — prescription eyeglasses, readers, sunglasses and eye care — are being converged.\n\n“Sales are up in those stores compared to the previous weeks,” Wildman says from headquarters in Camp Hill, Pa. “So the kiosk is definitely a draw. But there’s also the variable of having everything there together.”\n\nBreaking even\n\nAs for sales at the mall kiosks, Barnes acknowledges sales have been sluggish but making the break-even minimums. “Over Labor Day weekend, one store did $1,800 in a single day,” he says. “We need $3,000 [a week] to break even; $5,000 makes us incredibly profitable.”\n\nHe’s already had to shift his offerings and pricing — but probably not in the way you might imagine.\n\nBarnes wanted to offer only the high-end digital lenses but found that some customers didn’t trust newfangled lenses. And some felt the prices were too good to be true, so he actually raised them.\n\n“The most shocking thing was that people couldn’t and wouldn’t believe the price. By raising the price, we’ve seen more people be comfortable with purchasing the digital product.”\n\nAs for competitive reception at the mall: “It’s been bloody murder,” he says. “We knew that they weren’t going to be happy, but we didn’t know how bad of a reaction we were going to get.”\n\nDB Vision opened 20 feet away from the entrance of the EyeMasters in NorthEast Mall in Hurst. “They would just stand in their doorway and glare at us,” Barnes says. “They forced us to move to the center of the mall. It’s next to the Gap, so it’s actually better for us.”\n\nSteve Lay, general manager of Stonebriar, the General Growth Properties mall in Frisco, is intrigued with DB Vision’s differentiating focus of selling digital lenses at an affordable price. And he points to the company’s strong retailing heritage as a key reason he was willing to give it a whirl.\n\n“Their business model seems to be logical in that they’re keeping their overhead way down,” Lay says. “But they have a little credibility gap by being in a kiosk as compared to an inline store. There’s also the, ‘Can you really get glasses for $200 that are just as good as those that cost more?’ Those are obstacles they have to overcome.”\n\nHe diplomatically sidesteps the question of how irate other optical tenants are. “We’re a very large shopping center. We appeal to a lot of people, and we want to provide the best selection that we can for everybody’s needs.”"
