        "text": "This post was sponsored by Eyemart Express but all opinions are my own.\n\nI have worn glasses since the third grade, so honestly I don’t remember what life was like before them! Over the years, my use of contacts has dwindled more and more, and I really save them for special occasions or if glasses are not an option (aka skiing, skiing, skiing). Glasses have become a way for me to express my personal style and my collection just continues to grow. When Eyemart Express reached out, sharing their new High Street Collection, I was so excited to collaborate.\n\nI was excited to find out that there was an Eyemart Express just down the street from my office, making the process even easier! I met Stephanie at my local store and she helped me pick out the perfect new pair of glasses and sunnies from the collection. I chose the Pearl frames in Cream/Gold combo for my regular glasses and the Lady Bird Black frames for my sunnies and I am SO happy with my picks!\n\nThe High Street collection is inspired by the avant-garde styles of the eighties and nineties, and the iconic architecture of Brooklyn, New York. I’ve got to say, they nailed it. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to pull off the retro style of the Lady Bird, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun they were when I tried them on! The whole process of choosing the glasses from start to finish was so super easy! My glasses were available the same day, because they were in stock in the store which was perfect because I was able to take them on our Colorado vacay!"
