        "text": "Purchase price from $60-$6,000. Interest-free for 3 months for all qualified customers. Payment term options of 3, 6, and 12 months. Annual percentage rate (APR) 0%-29.99%. Checking options does not affect a customer's credit score. Customers must be at least 18 years of age (or higher as required by state law). Down payment required. State-issued ID, bank-issued debit card, and email address required. No application,pre-payment penalty, or late fees.\n\n\"Sunbit is an excellent program for customers like myself on a tight budget. I needed a new pair of glasses and thanks to the help of Sunbit I was able to get a pair that I loved, even though they were a little bit more expensive.\"\n\n\"The associate at the store was extremely helpful and explained everything thoroughly. It was a very fast process and the associate even had recommendations for me, so I ended up going with the 12-month contract. \"\n\n\"I purchased some glasses and frames using Sunbit. The information presented to me throughout the application process was clear and broken down very simply. The website is very easy to use if you want to manage your payments on your own.\"\n\n\"I purchased glasses for myself. The rep explained in detail my financing options and was very thorough in doing so. The process was very quick. I would have struggled to make this purchase if Sunbit was not an option.\"\n\n\"I was able to buy a very nice pair of glasses using Sunbit. This is actually the first loan I have ever applied for aside from my car loan and I could not believe how simple it was. Iâ€™d love to use Sunbit again when I need it.\""
