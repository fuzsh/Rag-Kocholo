The following are examples of the types of routine uses and disclosures of PHI that we are permitted to make. While this list is not exhaustive, it should give you an idea of the routine uses and disclosures we are permitted to make.\n\nFor Treatment: We will use and disclose your PHI to provide, coordinate, or manage your treatment. For example, we may disclose your PHI to an optician, ophthalmologist or other healthcare provider providing treatment to you when necessary to provide a service you requested. The primary use of your PHI is coordinating the purchase of prescribed vision correction by your doctor. For example, we use both your information as well as your doctor's information to validate your prescription as necessary.\n\nFor Payment: Your PHI will be used, as needed, to obtain payment for the health care services we provide you. For example, we may disclose your PHI to your health insurance plan so it will pay for your services.\n\nFor Health Care Operations: We may use or disclose your PHI in order to support our business activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, using your PHI for quality assessment and improvement activities, reviewing the competence or qualifications of healthcare professionals, evaluating practitioner and provider performance, conducting training programs, accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing activities.\n\nIt is unlikely that we will need to disclose your information other than during the course of regular business providing a service you requested. But we do reserve the right to use and disclose your PHI under the following circumstances.\n\nRequired By Law: We may use or disclose your PHI to the extent required to comply with a current law.\n\nJudicial and Administrative Proceedings: We may disclose your PHI in response to a court order, discovery request, subpoena or other lawful process.\n\nRequired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services: We may be required to disclose your PHI to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in response to a compliance investigation or review or enforcement action.\n\nPublic Health: We may disclose your PHI for public health activities, such as disclosures to a public health authority or other government agency that is permitted by law to collect or receive the information (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration).\n\nHealth Oversight: We may disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law, such as audits, investigations, and inspections. Oversight agencies include government agencies that oversee the health care system, government benefit programs, other government regulatory programs and civil rights laws.\n\nAbuse or Neglect: If you have been a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence, we may disclose your PHI to a government agency authorized to receive such information. In addition, we may disclose your PHI to a public health authority that is authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect.\n\nLaw Enforcement: We may disclose your PHI, so long as applicable legal requirements are met, for law enforcement purposes, such as providing information to the police about the victim of a crime.\n\nCoroners and Funeral Directors: We may disclose your PHI to a coroner, medical examiner or funeral director if it is needed to perform their legally authorized duties.\n\nOrgan Donation: If you are an organ donor, we may disclose your PHI to organ procurement organizations as necessary to facilitate organ donation or transplantation.\n\nResearch: Under certain circumstances, we may disclose your PHI to researchers when their research has been approved by an institutional review board that has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your PHI.\n\nSerious Threat to Health or Safety: We may disclose your PHI if we believe it is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public health or safety and it is to someone we reasonably believe is able to prevent or lessen the threat.\n\nSpecialized Government Functions: When the appropriate conditions apply, may disclose PHI for purposes related to military or national security concerns, such as for the purpose of a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs of your eligibility for benefits.\n\nNational Security and Intelligence Activities: We may disclose your PHI to authorized federal officials for intelligence, counterintelligence, protection of the President, other authorized persons or foreign heads of state, for purpose of determining your own security clearance and other national security activities authorized by law.\n\nInmates: We may use or disclose your PHI if you are an inmate of a correctional facility and we created or received your PHI in the course of providing care to you.\n\nWorkers' Compensation: We may disclose your PHI as necessary to comply with workers' compensation laws and other similar programs providing benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.\n\nBusiness Associates: We may disclose your PHI to persons who perform functions, activities or services to us or on our behalf that require the use or disclosure of PHI. To protect your health information, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your information.\n\nUnless you object, we may disclose to a member of your family, a relative, a close friend or any other person you identify, orally or in writing, your PHI that directly relates to that person's involvement in your health care. If you are unable to agree or object to such disclosure, we may disclose such information as necessary if we determine that it is in your best interest based on our professional judgment. We may use or disclose your PHI to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative or any other person that is responsible for your care of your location or general condition.\n\nFor Marketing: Unless otherwise permitted, we must obtain your written authorization to use and disclose your PHI for most marketing purposes. However, we may conduct face to face communications between you and us, and we may offer a promotional gift of nominal value, without such authorization.\n\nWe may also provide you with information regarding products or services that we offer related to your health care needs provided that we are not paid or otherwise receive compensation for such communications.\n\nWe are also permitted to communicate with you regarding health-related products or services, your treatment, case management, or care coordination (including recommending alternative treatments, providers or settings for care). However, if we will receive compensation for making any such communications, we must first obtain your written authorization, unless the communication describes only a drug or biologic that is currently prescribed for you and any compensation we receive relates solely to the cost of making the communication. This requirement does not apply to any payment or compensation for providing treatment to you.\n\nOther uses: Other uses and disclosures of your PHI, not described above, will be made only with your written authorization (unless otherwise permitted or required by law). You may revoke your authorization, at any time, in writing, except to the extent that we have taken action in reliance on the authorization.\n\nMinimum Disclosure\n\nA central aspect of our Privacy Policy is to not disclose more PHI than necessary. We will make a reasonable effort to use, disclose, and request only the minimum amount of PHI needed to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request."
