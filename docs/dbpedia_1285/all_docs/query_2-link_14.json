        "text": "By Staff\n\nFARMERS BRANCH, Texas—National optical retailer Eyemart Express is expanding its footprint in Indiana with the opening of four new stores this spring. The company is known for helping people see clearly faster with its convenient and affordable approach to eyecare that can be completed from start to finish—that is, from comprehensive eye exams to finished glasses—all in one day. This May, new storefronts in Avon, Columbus, Evansville, and Fishers will mark the company’s first presence in the Evansville and Indianapolis markets and more than double Eyemart Express’ existing footprint in Indiana.\n\nThe optical retailer currently has locations in Elkhart, Granger, and Fort Wayne. “We are proud to provide important eyecare services in a fast and accessible way to more communities in Indiana,” said Mike Nuzzo, Eyemart Express CEO. “The ability to see is so much bigger than a pair of glasses. Our unparalleled optical solution with on-site doctors, skilled associates, and on-site lab techs, helps customers see clearly faster, so special moments in life are never missed again.\n\n“Furthermore, our growth creates new and exciting career opportunities at a time when job stability is of utmost importance to many,” he said. Eyemart Express’ growth in the Hoosier State will create more than 50 new full- and part-time jobs, ranging from sales associates to lab technicians and opticians, the company said, adding that the company offers a variety of training and development programs to cultivate career paths in the optical industry along with a competitive benefits package for all associates.\n\nAt Eyemart Express, expert in-store lab techs can deliver quality glasses with free same-day speed—over 80 percent of glasses are finished in one hour. In addition, Indiana shoppers can either visit independent eye doctors conveniently located next door to Eyemart Express stores for a comprehensive eye exam or they can bring in an existing prescription from their eye doctor.\n\nEyemart Express was founded in 1990 and ranks among the top optical retailers in the country with its family of brands: Vision 4 Less, Visionmart Express, and Eyewear Express. The company has 249 stores across 42 states."
