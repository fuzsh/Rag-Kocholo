Doug Barnes Family have acquired all of the outstanding Class A common shares of the Company (the “Shares”) for $50.00 in cash per Share, other than certain Shares held by certain shareholders who received, in respect of such Shares, consideration consisting of common shares of the purchaser.\n\n“We look forward to working together with our new partners to take New Look Vision to the next level of growth and add value for our customers, partners and employees across North America,” said Antoine Amiel, President and Chief Executive Officer of New Look Vision.\n\n“We’re pleased with the successful outcome of this transaction,” said Chris Harris, Managing Partner at FFL Partners. “We look forward to supporting New Look Vision’s exceptional leadership team led by President and CEO Antoine Amiel, and pursuing significant opportunities that we’ve identified to further build its strong store network in North America’s vibrant and growing eye care market.”\n\n“This investment in New Look Vision – the leading Canadian eye care products and services provider – is aligned with our approach to support thriving entrepreneurial businesses in their expansion.
