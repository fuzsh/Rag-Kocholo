        "text": "Mike Nuzzo\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nMike Nuzzo brought the \"right leadership\" to Eyemart Express in 2022. With years of experience leading business development and expansion initiatives within the retail space, his growth-focused strategy brings Eyemart Express's unmatched optical expertise and customer convenience to new frontiers.\n\nMike graduated from Kenyon College with a bachelor's degree in economics before getting his master's degree in finance and accounting from the University of Chicago. Since then, he's held multiple leadership roles with well-known retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, General Nutrition Centers (GNC), and most recently, Petco, initially as Chief Financial Officer and more recently as Chief Operating Officer and President, overseeing supply chain, real estate/construction, and the pet services and veterinary care business areas. In his time at Petco, Mike led a turnaround of the grooming business, the launch and scaling of the in-store vet hospital business, and the creation of a new Petco farm and feed store format targeting expansion in small town/rural communities. He also expanded the Petco brand into Canada with a store-in-store arrangement with Canadian Tire Corporation and was chairman of the company's Petco Mexico joint venture.\n\nWhen he's not leading the development of Eyemart Express's long and short-term strategies, he enjoys running, hiking, reading history books, and spending quality time with his wife, four kids, and their two dogs.\n\nDr. Tom Patera\n\nSenior Executive Vice President\n\nDr. Tom Patera has had the “right vision” since 2005, following a long career in the optical/optometry industry. Dr. Patera and his team work diligently to maintain the company's premier affiliate program. Through strong relationships and forward thinking, the program has reached nearly 200 locations spread throughout 38 states. Keeping in line with the company's doctor founded and doctor friendly approach, Dr. Patera's expertise has played a key role in the company maintaining its nation-leading low doctor turnover and vacancy rates. He and his team continue to play an integral role in the expansion of the company's brand throughout the country. In addition to managing his own private optometric practice for many years, he has also held President and Vice President positions at regional optical chains in the Midwest and Northwest. He received his undergraduate education at Buena Vista University and his Doctor of Optometry degree from the Illinois College of Optometry.\n\nWhen Dr. Patera isn't bridging the gap between great doctors and Eyemart Express customers, he can be found on his tree farm recounting his adventurous tales from around the globe with his wife Sharon, their 3 sons, 3 daughters-in-law, and 8 grandchildren.\n\nKaty Hanson\n\nChief Marketing Officer\n\nKaty Hanson has had the “right strategy” for Eyemart Express since 2016. She began leading strategy and planning for all of Eyemart's marketing channels, and then she served as interim Chief Marketing Officer before joining the Eyemart Express leadership team as CMO in 2021. As CMO, Katy leads Eyemart Express' marketing operations, including strategy development and implementation of multichannel media plans for advertising, digital marketing, local store marketing, and brand initiatives. As Eyemart Express continues to grow and innovate, Katy's understanding of our customers, culture, and our Eyemart family remains invaluable.\n\nKaty spent three decades in strategic marketing and communications before joining the Eyemart Express family. She's held leadership roles at Blockbuster and Michaels Stores. While at Michaels, she served as the craft retailer's Vice President of Marketing, overseeing marketing initiatives across channels, including digital marketing, advertising, brand management, and the retailer's in-store experience.\n\nWhen Katy isn't developing strategies for multichannel initiatives, you can find her hitting the hiking and mountain biking trails with her wife, Penny and their two sons.\n\nJason Shanks\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nJason has been providing the “right counsel” since 2014. He oversees the company's legal affairs, regulatory compliance, and business relationships regarding our associates and optometrist affiliates. A firm believer in maximizing the company's business opportunities, he works diligently to minimize risk, allowing leadership to focus on what Eyemart Express does best—provide high quality products and excellent customer service. Jason is also the head of managed care operations, ensuring our in-store associates are trained and equipped with the knowledge to service our insurance customers in the best way possible. Jason received his bachelor's degree from Austin College and his Juris Doctor from Southern Methodist University. He began practicing law in 1999, working almost 15 years for a major law firm before joining Eyemart Express. In 2006, he transitioned his focus to optical law and is currently recognized as one of the leading optical attorneys in the United States.\n\nWhen he isn't managing partnerships and mitigating risk, you can find Jason on the golf course or traveling the world with his wife, Nancy, and two daughters. Depending on the season, you can also catch him on the field or on the court coaching his daughters' sports teams.\n\nDr. David Nelson\n\nSenior Vice President of Professional Services\n\nDr. David Nelson brings a wealth of eye care knowledge to the leadership team. His expertise drives innovation in clinical research, best practices, and the technology that each of our partnered eye doctors uses.\n\nDr. Nelson graduated from the Indiana University School of Optometry in 1985 and has been practicing ever since. He's worked in a multi-disciplinary clinic for over a decade, and for more than 20 years, he's practiced in a private, multi-location, self-founded optometric office in Madison, Wisconsin. Additionally, following many years as an AOA board member, Dr. Nelson became President of the American Optometric Association. He's served on several advisory committees for eyecare industry partners and has provided educational lectures for optometrists regarding retina, dry eye disease, and nutrition.\n\nWhen Dr. Nelson isn't busy benefiting our doctor and patient experience, he likes playing golf, traveling, and spending time with his wife, Sheryl, and son, Charlie. He loves country music but enjoys every genre due to his early years playing piano and participating in a jazz band.\n\nKeith O'Connor\n\nSenior Vice President of Information Technology\n\nKeith started developing the “right software” for the Eyemart Express team in 2008. He believes that a strong focus on technology and smart software are advantageous to both our customers and our company. Taking great ideas from all areas of the company and transforming them in to solid processes backed by technology has helped Eyemart Express stay one step ahead of the competition. Keith is responsible for our technical initiatives including the development of our new online store. He and his team also oversee data warehousing, data center infrastructure, hybrid cloud deployments, and technical support. Keith holds a degree in computer science from Texas A&M University.\n\nWhen he isn't developing new ways to make Eyemart Express a technical leader in the retail space, he can be found spending time with his wife, Haley, and their daughter. He secretly hopes that one day his daughter will love technology just as much as he does.\n\nHesham Bakr\n\nSVP Human Resources\n\nHesham Bakr has been transforming HR functions for Eyemart Express since 2021. With over 24 years of Human Resources experience, he unleashes the company's potential through extensive organizational restructuring and analytics-driven growth strategies. Additionally, he has big plans for talent development, an accelerated new store success curve, B2B sales generation, and more.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of San Francisco, Hesham immediately followed his passion for Operations, working as a regional manager for the Walt Disney Co. and directing operations at the Disneyland Resort. Ops experience paved the way to Human Resources experience, prompting him to seriously pursue working in HR at companies like CBRE, Yum! Brands, and Raising Cane’s. In 2018, Hesham founded an independent craft coffeehouse focused on supporting local businesses, schools, and the community, which has since expanded to 3 locations.\n\nWhen he has time away from executing Eyemart’s multi-year initiatives, Hesham enjoys kayaking, coming up with new recipes for his coffee shop, chauffeuring his kids to activities, and spending time with his wife, Asil, and 3 children, Jenna, Taline, and Zain."
