        "text": "Submitted\n\nNational optical retailer Eyemart Express is opening its first location in the Indianapolis area with a storefront in Fishers on April 17.\n\nThe optical retailer, located at 8240 E. 96th St., is known for helping people see clearly faster with its convenient and affordable approach to eye care that can be completed start to finish – from comprehensive eye exams to finished glasses – all in one day. The Texas-based company is set to open two more locations in Indianapolis this May.\n\nEyemart Express in Fishers will create around a dozen full- and part-time jobs, ranging from sales associates to lab technicians and opticians. The retailer offers a variety of training and development programs to cultivate career paths in the optical industry along with a competitive benefits package for all associates.\n\n“Demand has grown in Fishers for high-quality eyewear that you can wear home on the same day and won’t break the bank,” said Marie Shaffer, Eyemart Express manager in Fishers. “Our stores are an easy and convenient choice for time-strapped shoppers who want to maintain their eye health.”\n\nEyemart Express provides quality prescription eyewear with free same-day service thanks to its local lens labs and skilled lab techs; over 80 percent of glasses are finished in one hour. The optical retailer carries more than 2,000 frames at affordable prices from popular brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, and Versace. Kids can select from a wide assortment of glasses, including frames by Jonas Paul, Paw Patrol, and My Little Pony.\n\nFishers shoppers can either schedule a comprehensive eye exam with the independent doctor next door to Eyemart Express or they can bring in an existing prescription from their eye doctor. The optical retailer also accepts more than 1,000 insurance plans, helping shoppers maximize insurance benefits, and store associates will even complete any required paperwork.\n\nEyemart Express focuses on community giving, and offers everyday savings to veterans, military families, first responders, health care workers, teachers, and school staff members.\n\nEyemart Express will be open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. It will be closed on Sunday."
