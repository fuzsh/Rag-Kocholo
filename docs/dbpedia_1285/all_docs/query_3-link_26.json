        "text": "CAREER UPDATE-- Today officially marks my last day at Lenskart and NesoBrands, and with it comes a mix of emotions. Wrapping up an 18-month journey that's been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride - filled with ups and downs, learning curves and experiences that have been profoundly enriching. It feels surreal, thinking back to 2020, when we had to put Haazri to rest. That was tough. But then, teaming up with Aniruddh Singh and Riyaz Khan to breathe life into goDutch - that sparked a whole new adventure. These last four years have been transformative, to say the least. I owe a ton of that to Aniruddh, Riyaz, and it truly feels like the end of an era. And now, it's time for me to pivot back to where my heart truly beats the loudest - entrepreneurship. I still remember leaving my job at EY at 21, buzzing with energy, ready to take on the world. Fast forward to today, at 29, I'm stepping back into the entrepreneurial arena, this time with a trove of experiences and insights, ready to dive into new depths. Behind the scenes, I’ve been nurturing a project, something I'm incredibly passionate about. This project is the culmination of years of learning, experimenting, and dreaming. Can't wait to share what’s next. The future is bright, and the journey is just beginning. 🌟 #nextstep #change\n\n✨✨✨ Happy Monday ✨✨✨ Starting my 18th week at Vanaways feeling FULL of smiles 😁 & very grateful ✔️ when I look back and reflect on the last 18 weeks it’s been such an AMAZING rollercoaster of a journey & this is only the START 🎢💪⭐️🫨👀🤩 …to the brand new #customers I have managed to support so far, and the new #prospects that will experience the FANTASTIC customer service levels from #Vanaways very soon when your vehicles are delivered into your fleets 🛻 … I appreciate you all A LOT and cannot thank you enough for trusting me to support your fleet requirements ………… you’ll really never look back once you experience the #Vanaways way 💪 The growth plans of the company, are phenomenal and I CANNOT wait to be a part of them as we approach the end of 2023 and enter the new year (how crazy to even say this!!!!) 🧨 • The partnerships we have are SOLID.

After working 23 years for one flexible packaging manufacture, it was time to spread my wings and see how the packaging industry outside a relatively well-protected framework works, so I joined RATTPACK. The whole thing has taken an incredible development for me. Starting as Head of R&D with a super #rattianer Team, implementing the murFlex® recyclable product portfolio. Helping businesses that want to reduce their environmental impact without sacrificing product protection or quality. As Head of R&D, Sales and Business Development, Responsible for the overall direction, strategic development, performance and maintenance of the R&D, Sales activities internal and external. To become Innovation Director and Member of the Management together with Albert Trebo, Sami Karaguelmez and Stefan German. Advancing the vision, strategy, and methodologies used to innovate new products and services. Introducing novel or pioneering ideas, improve existing processes, and create a culture of innovation within the #rattianer Team and company. Do I regret risking the big step? Not at all. 😎 #RATTPACK. A great family owned company provides a lot of benefits and opportunities for all employees to improve and reach their personal and/or professional goals. Whether a receptionist, after internal and external training/studies, became part of the HR teams. Trainees in the laboratory after many years of service, become heads of department. R&D employees change internally to the material procurement department. Operators become Shop Floor Team Leaders. Or even laboratory employees switch to the OTC process to provide their skills in daily customer service and care. WHERE THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY 👍 And now I have the privilege of celebrating together the 70th anniversary of the RATTPACK® Group Happy Birthday RATTPACK® Group #rattians #rattpack #proudtobe\n\n𝗟𝗲𝘁'𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 \"𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴\" 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀. 🤔 When I hear \"team building,\" I think of cheesy trust falls and awkward icebreakers. But real teams are built by pulling together every day, not at annual or semi-annual company events. So I say we rename \"team building\" to what it is - a \"team appreciation\" event. The goal isn't to build a team in one day. It's to celebrate the team we already have. Fun trips allow us to say thank you for everyone's hard work and to get to know each other outside of work. Take Scanbot SDK: Last summer, we had a wine tasting with the whole company. 🍷 For our Christmas party, we had a beer and chocolate tasting. 🍫🍺Last Friday, we played laser tag. 🔫 We deliberately call these events 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 - not 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀. Because these days are FOR the team. ––– TLDR: Let's rename \"team building\" to \"team appreciation\" - because these events are about celebrating our existing team, not magically building a new one. #TeamBuilding #TeamAppreciation #Team #CompanyEvent #LaserTag\n\n#DreamTeam Two months ago when we first gathered to discuss the project “Pipeline Infrastructure Limited Annual Day”, the only thing all of us had in common was the excitement to make 5th Anniversary a memory of a lifetime for every PIL family member. And what a joy it was to see our employees and their extended family smiling and enjoying all the hard work we put in to make this celebration a blockbuster hit! This success is a testament to the commitment of the core team. Abhijit Surwade – for agreeing to host the event (not that he had a choice 😝) in a stylish and energetic manner. There was not a single dull moment! Ankur Mullick - for helping close all tasks on time and ensuring the team is on track with deliverables. Atul Chaturvedi - for sharing the right data to ensure no one is missed @Mitali Wagh- for your can-do attitude towards every task allotted. Mohit Raj - for unwavering support with engaging presentation content. Pranav Kelkar - for ensuring timely processing of payments and thus ensuring happy and content vendors Shruti Nair – for sharing the responsibility at every stage of the planning and execution ( and for being my agony aunt 😝). Not to forget, my team at firebrand labs Mona Adesara arvind aathreya for their bang on concepts, designs and timely delivery of all deliverables. Last but not the least, Akhil Mehrotra for your untiring faith in our ability to deliver Excellence as One-Team. Together, there is no challenge too great, no goal too ambitious. Let us look forward with anticipation to the opportunities that lie ahead. #anniversarycelebration #annualday #employeecare #5thyear #oilandgas\n\n''No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.” When I reflect on my journey, one truth stands out above all: none of this would have been possible without #teamwork. It's more than just a practice or a process—it's a transformative force that can change everything. Imagine minds converging on a singular idea, aligned in purpose and passion and what all can be achieved through it. Recently, with an office opening at hand, everyone had more tasks than they could count, yet they all went above and beyond to make the opening, a successful event. I believe no task is beneath anyone, and I'm proud to see this mindset imbibed in each team member. Whether it's helping with sample making or a photoshoot, everyone is involved in everything. (literally everything) Every task, every project is a team effort. Yes, individual goals are important, but being a team player takes us to unimaginable heights. The success we achieve as a team is far greater than what any of us could accomplish alone. Every challenge we face becomes a stepping stone, and every milestone we reach is the proof our collective strength. So, here's to my incredible team at ARRCOAT! Your dedication and teamwork are truly inspiring. Let's continue to elevate together, reaching new heights and celebrating many more victories. Let’s continue conquering with the same mindset because… Together, we rise! #Recognition #GrowTogether #Effort #Team #ARRCOAT #Achievements"
