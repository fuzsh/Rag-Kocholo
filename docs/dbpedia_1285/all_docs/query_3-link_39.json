        "text": "Last week my daughter called me crying her eyes out. No parent ever wants to hear their child upset. I was trying to make sure she was OK and was having trouble understanding what she was saying. But I finally got her to calm down to tell me what was wrong.\n\nEarlier that morning Erica and her were talking about going shopping and that was all I knew they were doing that day. Well my little girl who is growing up way to fast wanted to bring her wallet and some of her own money. Erica told her before they left to count her money and to make sure that she only brings just $20 or $40 of her money with her. Well my daughter takes after me and is quite hard headed or determined to do what she wants. And needless to say she didn't listen to her Mom.\n\nAt the checkout counter she went to buy a couple of items and she couldn't find her wallet. In all of the excitement of going store to store she had dropped it. This was in a busy parking lot but they backtracked all of their steps and went in the stores looking for it. Checked all of the bags and Erica left her name and number at the front of the last store they remembered having it. And then the waterworks started. Erica told her at least she only lost a little bit of her money...and it wasn't that big of a deal. Well that is when she confessed that she brought quite a bit more money than she was supposed to of. This is about the time that my phone rang. Erica normally the calm one was a little upset that she didn't listen to her and I for once was pretty calm, now that I knew they were OK. So I was just like you just learned a valuable lesson and you need to be much more careful with your things. Crying she said well Mom left her name in number in the store. I replied back that maybe it will show up in my head thinking the chances aren't good.\n\nA Really Kind Person\n\nAdmittedly, I figured someone had picked it up took the cash and tossed the wallet. But a few days later Erica got a call from the admission director at our school letting her know that our daughters wallet was found. The wallet was turned in to a nearby store The Eyemart Express in Salisbury. The supervisor there - Mr. Gary Wolf took the time and googled some of the information in the wallet and figured out where she went to school and left a message that the wallet was found and turned in.\n\nErica and my daughter went in to get her wallet and her card and all of her money was still there. Things like this don't happen much anymore. My daughter gave Gary a Thank You card and a small gift card for being the awesome guy he is. If you know Gary please give him a pat on the back! He really made our daughters day. When they were there they asked him if he happened to know the person who turned it in but unfortunately he did not.\n\nWell how can you say Thank You to someone you don't know? I know how... Just encourage more people to do things that are Kind! So I made a contribution to kindSBY and now Shop Local Delmarva is a Kindness Champion! What better way to pay it forward than to help spread kindness around our community!\n\nTo the awesome person who turned in my daughter's wallet. Thank You. Thank You for showing a little girl that there are a lot of really great people out there. To Gary, thanks for taking the time and making the effort to track down our daughter and get her wallet back to her.\n\nAnd by the way one of our awesome members on our group Michelle Nelson is a Kindness Commissioner with kindSBY and she actually awarded me a Kindness Badge awhile back. I still have it too...ask Erica I still pull it out when I need to prove a point! :)\n\nTo learn more about kindSBY just click one of the hyperlinks or head over to: https://kindsby.org While you are checking out their site download a Kindness Card and share a kind word or an act of kindness with someone.\n\nDavid\n\nShop Local Delmarva\n\nAnd don't forget our Supporters, Partners, and Sponsors.\n\nYou may notice certain businesses are highlighted and standout not only in the directory but we highlight them on our Facebook Page as well as our group. This ever growing list of businesses help us promote a lot of great things in our community. Many of our blogs which you can find right here are focused on our community and our local businesses.\n\nMany of these businesses are helping us promote other local businesses. Which really is what Delmarva is all about. I am asked quite often how a business can be part of Shop Local Delmarva. If you are part of our group you are part of Shop Local Delmarva. If you like the group and like the concept of a digital type of media that we share blogs, videos, highlights and features and want to be part of it we would love to have your support. You can find out more information here. All of our supporters, partners, and sponsors are on the rotating banners on most of our blogs just like this one.\n\nIf any of our supporters, partners, or sponsors have upcoming events we encourage them to let us know so we can help them promote them as well. Just like the recent launch of Baywater Farms and Williams Market's open house, or Addie's customer appreciation day that we have highlighted in our blogs to name a few. In addition our blogs are also highlighting several important non profits and community events.\n\nThe whole idea of Shop Local Delmarva is all about our local community supporting local businesses, and our local businesses supporting our local community. It goes round and round."
