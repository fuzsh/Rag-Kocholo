The organization provides a comforting space where they can feel safe, with caring volunteers offering clean clothes, toys, and cozy blankets. We’re proud to support this important cause and grateful for everyone who enjoyed lemonade while waiting for their new glasses! #EyemartExpress #Optical #CustomerService #EmployeeAppreciation #EyemartTeam #CommunityOutreach #GivingBack\n\nAs the exclusive eye care partner of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), we deeply value the dedication and sacrifices made by our veterans and active-duty military personnel.
