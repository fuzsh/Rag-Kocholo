        "text": "Here's a bit of good retail news for a change.\n\nA new thrift store named Savers is opening April 2 at 1740 Mall Drive and hiring at least 50 people. And a new shop for eyeglasses has opened across from Best Buy, while Allan Yee, who formerly owned Chef Yee's in downtown Duluth, will open a restaurant in a Woodland bowling alley by Valentine's Day.\n\nThe Savers thrift shop will offer clothes, household items, books, electronics, furniture, sporting goods, toys and items for infants.\n\nTerry Larrivy, of Duluth, who was shopping next door at Kmart on Thursday, said the new red sign piqued his curiosity.\n\n\"I was wondering what it's all about,\" Larrivy said. He said he'd be happy to shop where he can save a little extra. \"I'll probably check it out.\"\n\nThe chain has six stores throughout the state, but this is the first one in the Twin Ports. The company will have a hiring fair Feb. 10 through 12 to hire at least 50 people.\n\nWashington-based Savers Inc., spends more than $117 million annually on purchasing items in bulk from nonprofits that collect donated items. What it can't sell here -- about 500 million pounds annually -- is sold to developing countries.\n\nFor more information on the company, visit www.savers.com .\n\nEyemart Express\n\nEyemart Express, a one-hour eyeglass maker, just opened at 2510 Maple Grove Road, Suite 500. Glasses start at $38.74 a pair.\n\n\"Our concept is built around providing a great selection of brand-name frames at prices lower than the competition, along with the convenience of one-hour service,\" said Dr. Doug Barnes, owner and president of the Eyemart Express chain.\n\nThe business now has 83 stores in 20 states, with Duluth its only Minnesota location.\n\nChef Yee\n\nFor fans of the former Chef Yee's Chinese restaurant, chef Allan Yee will open a restaurant at Tanski's Ridgeview Lanes bowling alley in Rice Lake Township, 3930 E. Calvary Road.\n\nThis time he's serving primarily American fare such as hamburgers and sandwiches, with a little sweet and sour chicken and General Tsao's chicken also on the menu."
