        "text": "DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–National optical retailer Eyemart Express today announced that it has appointed Mike Nuzzo to serve as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Nuzzo will leverage his seasoned retail management experience to lead the Company’s next phase of growth. He succeeds interim CEO Jason Shanks, who will return to his roles as General Counsel and Head of Managed Vision Care Operations.\n\n“I’m thrilled to join Eyemart Express as the demand for high quality glasses and ophthalmic care for adults and children continues to remain strong in North America,” said Nuzzo. “Eyemart Express has positioned itself as a leader in the eyewear retail space and I look forward to working with their talented team as we continue to fulfill the vital need for fast service and prescription vision care, while generating positive clinical outcomes for our customers.”\n\nMr. Nuzzo brings extensive business acumen and operations experience to Eyemart Express from Petco, where he spent the last eight years, most recently serving as COO and President of Petco Services. During that time, he helped develop its pet care center and veterinary strategy, as well as transforming its pet service offerings to improve customers’ omni-channel shopping experience.\n\n“Mike is a decisive leader with significant retail experience whose appointment as CEO of Eyemart Express reflects his seasoned senior management experience and ability to positively impact a company’s growth and performance,” said Chris Harris, Co-Managing Partner of FFL Partners and Chairman of the Board at Eyemart Express. “We would like to thank Jason Shanks for his dedication to the organization, and his impressive contributions as interim CEO during this executive leadership transition.”\n\nPrior to joining Petco in 2015, Nuzzo was an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at General Nutrition Centers (GNC), a leading global health and wellness brand. Previously, he served in various financial and operational leadership roles at Abercrombie & Fitch, including Senior Vice President of Finance. Nuzzo earned an MBA in finance and accounting from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1998, following his BS in Economics from Kenyon College in 1992.\n\n“As Eyemart Express continues to shape the optical retail industry, I am excited that Mike, an incredibly talented executive with an exceptional track record, will be leading the team,” said David Kass, Principal at Leonard Green & Partners. “His unique perspectives and expertise in strategy, operations and growth will drive deeper awareness and preference for Eyemart’s affordable, convenient, fast and pleasant customer experience.”"
