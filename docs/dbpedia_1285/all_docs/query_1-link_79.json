        "text": "Anyone have experience with Shopko East 10th Street Optical? I stopped there a couple of months ago and a gal optometrist helped me with something on my glasses....I didn't get her name but she was very helpful. I can't see any reviews on this store but the one on 41st Street had really poor customer service indications. I need new glasses and an eye exam and this is in my network.\n\nGlasses. Hi all. My daughter is visiting us from North Carolina next month. We have not been able to see her in almost 2 years due to covid. Needless to say , we are excited. She is a college student and works full time. I want to treat her to get her eyes checked and get new glasses. I know this isnâ€™t something she has prioritized and well, i am her mom. ðŸ˜„ so , saying that. Can you recommend a eye dr / eyeglass store that has great options for a 21 year old? Thanks. ~ monica ~"
