        "text": "The staff is friendly, and they had my glasses made in only an hour! What would have cost me $300-$400 elsewhere, I got at Eyemart for about $100. I wish that I'd known about them sooner! At first I thought with a name like \"EyeMart\" they are probably inexpensive because their product is cheap, but I found out that its because they have their own lab there. My glasses are holding up great and I can go in anytime for free adjustments and cleanings.\n\nI had a pair of glasses made and was told the lenses were covered with one year of scratch protection. I went in before my lense protection was to expire and was told I can't have them remade because my prescription expired a few days before I came in. I wanted my exact lenses remade as they were and was told that I cannot have them remade until I get another prescription written. I asked to see this written somewhere in documentation. The dumbfounded staff could not produce any company policies or brochures with the rules. After demanding to see it written somewhere the girl helping me called her manager because the lens tech in the back \"didn't want to get involved\" she told her coworker in front of me. The person on the phone, I assume a manager, told her it's \"state law.\" I would love to see this written in state law, as I assume this is another fabricated loophole to get out of accountability for their one year policy. Unless I'm getting a new pair of glasses, there is no reason why I should have to get another prescription for the same pair of glasses. Complete waste of money, rude and ignorant employees. Do not trust Eye Mart. They WILL take your money and run.\n\nAs far as the optical shop goes, the frames seem to be of good quality, however the customer service needs some SERIOUS work. When we were there there was a tall blonde woman, a red head named amber and a little Asian girl who couldn't stop talking about her previous employment at LensCrafters. Amber was very rude, had a nasty attitude and was unwilling to offer assistance when we were not satisfied with our sons spectacles. Her exact words were \"I'm not dealing with this\" and she walked off. Very rude, will never return and will never recommend.\n\nDo not use their optometrist either. When he gave me a poor prescription and I complained that I was unsatisfied he told me that my eye floaters were causing him to not be able to prescribe an accurate prescription and that because of them no doctor would ever be able to correct the vision in my left eye to 20/20. Seriously? Went to an ophthalmologist at the eyecare center and now have a PERFECT prescription, the ophthalmologist was dumbfounded by Dr.Marcums evaluation.\n\nDon't waste your time and money, if you MUST have glasses same day then spend the extra few dollars and utilize LensCrafters or Alaska eye center."
