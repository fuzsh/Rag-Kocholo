        "text": "Six-month and one-year BNPL interest-bearing plans through Sunbit are also available for shoppers who would like more time to make payments. Due to state restrictions, Eyemart Express stores located in West Virginia and Wyoming are not eligible for the BNPL solution at this time.\n\n“We are constantly focused on improving our customers’ lives by helping them see better with new glasses and now by relieving a potential financial burden with a new payment option. The Sunbit model is aligned with our convenience-focused service that makes the process of getting new glasses fast and easy. This partnership enables us to further our position as a leader in the optical space with our emphasis on the customer’s experience,” says Eyemart Express CEO Michael Bender.\n\nEyemart Express offers the most convenient experience for customers buying glasses. Knowledgeable opticians take precise measurements to ensure frames fit correctly, and all stores are equipped with on-site lens labs and skilled technicians so that high-quality glasses can be ordered and delivered in as little as 30 minutes. All glasses purchased from Eyemart Express also come with a one-year frame warranty that covers any adjustments or breakages.\n\n“No matter how our customers shop with us, we remove all the guesswork from buying new glasses. They shop with us at Eyemart Express because they know their glasses will fit the first time,” says Bender.\n\nFor those who prefer to shop online, the optical retailer’s e-commerce platform is available for existing customers. Trained opticians at local stores take a customer’s measurements and input the information into an online system. This ensures proper fit and provides customers with a curated selection of high-quality frames that are ideal for their prescription and lens type in case they want to shop later at home. Shoppers can also easily update prescriptions online over time.\n\nEyemart Express continues to operate all 229 store locations with the highest safety standards. The optical retailer disinfects all frames after every use by customers and requires all customers wear masks and practice social distancing.\n\nFor more information about Eyemart Express’ new flexible payment option and how the optical retailer is making prescription eyewear more accessible, visit EyemartExpress.com.\n\nAbout Eyemart Express\n\nEyemart Express, a national optical retailer known for providing high-quality prescription eyewear in as little as 30 minutes, has been improving people’s lives by helping them see better for more than 30 years.
