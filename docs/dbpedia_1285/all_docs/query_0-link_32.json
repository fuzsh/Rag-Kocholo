        "text": "Frequently Asked Patient Questions\n\nQ. Are you employed by Eyemart Express?\n\nA. No. We are independent doctors of optometry who chose to locate our practices at Eyemart Express. We do not sell eyewear.. We provide comprehensive eye exams, sell contact lens and treat ocular disease.\n\nQ. How can your fees be so much lower than other eye doctors? Will I receive a quality exam?\n\nA. We provide a thorough exam with the most advanced diagnostic instruments to evaluate your vision needs and uncover any other ocular conditions that may go undetected, if not regularly monitored. We received our doctor’s degree after the same four years of training that all optometrists receive and was licensed to practice by the state after extensive testing. We can offer lower fees because our overhead is lower operating here, and we are able to keep busy seeing patients all day because of our convenient location.\n\nQ. Will I receive a written prescription after the exam? Will the prescription be accepted anywhere?\n\nA. We will supply a written prescription and summary of your exam as you leave the office.The prescription is valid anywhere in the U.S.\n\nQ. I had an eye exam a little over a year ago, and my vision seems fine. Why do I need another exam?\n\nA. We think it is important that all of our patients receive an annual eye exam. Your vision can change over a 12-month period. A regular check-up enables us to uncover any sight-threatening ocular conditions that can develop, unnoticed by you.\n\nQ. Will you accept my insurance plan?\n\nA. For the convenience of our patients, we accept most vision plans for whatever portion of the examination cost the plan covers. Please tell us your insurance company so that we can confirm your coverage.\n\nQ. Why does it cost more for a contact lens exam?\n\nA. We do additional testing with contact lens patients to measure the curvature of the eye to ensure that we prescribe the lens that optimizes fit and comfort. We also do an evaluation after you have worn the lenses for a given period to make sure there are no complications.\n\nQ. Aren’t all contact lenses the same? Shouldn’t I just buy the cheapest ones?\n\nA. They are not all the same. The contact lens companies spend millions of dollars every year to improve their lenses and regularly introduce new and better technology. You wouldn’t want to buy a five-year-old computer. For the same reason, it’s best to keep current and wear the latest and best lenses. Right now the companies are introducing new lens materials that allow much more oxygen to pass through, making them healthier to wear and enabling people to wear them in comfort for a longer period. We recommend these new materials to most patients, even though they cost a little more, because they are proven to be better for their eyes in the long run.\n\nQ. Will my contact lens prescription allow me to buy any brand of lens I want?\n\nA. Your prescription is for a specific brand of contact lens that our examination and experience tell us is best for your vision and ocular health.\n\nQ. Is it safe to wear a contact lens with a small tear in it?\n\nA. A torn lens can damage the delicate outer tissue of your eye and lead to serious infection. If you tear a lens and do not have a replacement, come into the office right away and we can often provide a lens that you can wear until your new supply arrives."
