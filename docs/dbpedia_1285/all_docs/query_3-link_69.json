        "text": "JACKSON, MI – From long-awaited retail stores to family-owned eateries, many new Jackson County businesses opened in 2023.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the businesses that opened this year.\n\nRelated: These Jackson County businesses closed in 2023\n\nOld Irish Mill\n\nAfter almost nine years of setbacks and delays, parts of the Old Irish Mill opened to the public in May.\n\nDaniel Ross, owner of TransPharm PreClinical Solutions, bought the former Ford Motor Co. plant at 221 Mill St. in Brooklyn in 2014, with plans to turn it into an attraction. After some setbacks and several changes to the plans, a marijuana dispensary and the Irish Hills Chamber of Commerce have finally moved into the historic building.\n\nHydrobudz and the chamber of commerce have moved into a 5,000-square-foot space on the left side of the building. These are just two businesses for the Old Irish Mill. The project also calls for a large event space inside the 30,000-square-foot building, as well as a demonstration kitchen and Irish restaurant and more.\n\nRead more: At last! Old Irish Mill opens with first 2 tenants and more on the way\n\nMurphy’s Bistro\n\nA new bistro has made its way into downtown Jackson. Owner Jessica Tobin and general manager Emma Stark opened Murphy’s Bistro in the former Economy Art & Framing building at 145 W. Michigan Ave.\n\nThe restaurant had a soft opening Dec. 5 and will host a grand opening in the future. Murphy’s Bistro offers sandwiches, salads, baked goods and other items. They will also sell craft beer and wine, Tobin said.\n\nRead more: What’s that Jackson? A new restaurant is coming to downtown\n\nTropical Smoothie Cafe\n\nTropical Smoothie Cafe, a fast, casual restaurant, opened in the fall inside a 1,400-square-foot-building with a drive thru by Hobby Lobby in Jackson Crossing, 1361 Boardman Road.\n\nThe chain has more than 1,175 U.S. locations and features a variety of smoothies and foods for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\nRead more: The wait is nearly over: Tropical Smoothie Cafe opening soon in Jackson\n\nDairy Queen\n\nThe new Dairy Queen at 2588 Airport Road in Blackman Township was first announced in September 2022. While construction saw some delays, the location opened in March, co-owner Rania Eljawad said.\n\nOwners and franchisees Todd Haidous and Eljawad own several other Dairy Queen locations in Southern Michigan, including in Genesee and Hillsdale counties.\n\nThis is the third Dairy Queen in the Jackson County area. The others are at 106 N. Elm Ave. in the city and 224 Fifth St. in Michigan Center. While these two established locations only offer soft serve, this new Dairy Queen serves food, too.\n\nRead more: New Dairy Queen will open in Jackson County very soon\n\nThe Front Porch JXN\n\nOwners Kendra Dolson and Courtney Webber share a passion for growing things. In 2020, the pair, friends since they were 12 years old, decided to turn that passion into a Jackson business called The Front Porch JXN.\n\nDolson and Webber started selling flowers they had around their homes, booked a couple of weddings and things took off from there. The two have since moved the business from their homes into a brick-and-mortar location next door to the Jackson Candle Company, 218 S. Mechanic St.\n\nRead more: What’s that Jackson? New shop coming to downtown\n\nThe Five Forks\n\nThe Five Forks was born out of COVID-19 when sisters Mallory Vredeveld and Maddison Husted were either laid off or left their jobs. Baking has always been a passion for Husted, so she messaged Vredeveld one day, asking if she wanted to just bake cakes for some extra funds, Vredeveld said.\n\nThe business grew and expanded to an actual brick-and-mortar location in February at 1194 N. West Ave., Suite A.\n\nRead more: Michigan’s Best Local Eats: Cakesicles are on the sweet treat menu The Five Forks\n\n517 Drift\n\nChris Schiffman quickly fell in love with the remote-control drift car community he became a part of a couple of years ago and wanted to share his passion with others.\n\nSchiffman opened his own track, 517 Drift, inside Westwood Mall in spring 2023 in the mall’s hallway. However, after he found tearing down and rebuilding the tracks almost daily to be too much work, Schiffman relocated into an empty 5,200-square-foot space next to Applebee’s.\n\nRead more: What’s that Jackson? A business in Westwood Mall is offering a new kind of hobby\n\nBlessed In\n\nTimothy Lewis, also known as “Lew,” moved his business “Blessed In” into Westwood Mall on July 21. After selling clothes online and from his vehicle for several years, Lewis said he decided it was time to transition into a brick-and-mortar store so he could have more face-to-face interactions with customers.\n\nLewis’ fashion journey began in high school when he was known by his peers as a “sneaker head” and a fashion guy. When he graduated from Jackson High School in 2011, he was like the other kids in trying to decide what he wanted in a career.\n\nHis clothing, for men and women, ranges from hoodies, sweatpants, T-shirts, trucker hats and shorts, all designed by Lewis.\n\nRead more: What’s that Jackson? There’s a new store at Westwood Mall\n\nRoss Dress for Less\n\nRoss Dress for Less moved into a 21,000-square-foot space inside Jackson Crossing and hosted a grand opening Oct. 7.

A long-awaited discount store is finally opening in Jackson\n\nFour Corners Coffee\n\nApryl Macleod spent a lot of time working at coffee shops around the Jackson County area. Eventually, her husband Robb suggested they create a cozy coffee shop of their own.\n\nHe started writing a business plan, and they purchased the historic Somerset General Store in 2018 and created Four Corners Coffee, 10250 Somerset Road. While it took a few years, the long-awaited coffee shop opened at the end of August.\n\nRead more: Michigan’s Best Local Eats: Historic Somerset store is now home to a local coffee shop\n\nSpad’s Twisters\n\nSpad’s Twisters opened in March, replacing Swiss Treat at 4005 Lansing Ave. The business was taken over by Rebecca Lewis, who continues to bring sweet treats to the area.\n\nRelated: A new ice cream shop is replacing Swiss Treat near Jackson\n\nThe ice cream shop specializes in soft-serve treats. The menu features a range of cones, sundaes, shakes and flurries.\n\nRead more: Michigan’s Best Local Eats: The Trash Can is a sundae filled with candy at Spad’s Twisters\n\nBaby Bear Burger\n\nRemnants of the House of Taco have officially disappeared, and a popular Jackson food truck business took its place.\n\nBaby Bear Burger opened its brick-and-mortar restaurant in March. The burger shop received nonstop business, with cars wrapping around the drive-thru to get a taste of the bear-themed burgers, loaded fries, hot dogs, sides and more, owner Marshawn Goodloe said.\n\nBaby Bear Burger announced it was moving into the building at 2400 Page Ave. in February after a year of traveling in a food truck.\n\nRead more: Michigan’s Best Local Eats: Giant burgers, loaded fries served now at Baby Bear Burger’s new location\n\nJackson Liquidation Center\n\nA new Jackson business featuring rows of bins filled with discounted items just waiting for customers to browse through opened in Jackson in June.\n\nJackson Liquidation Center, 975 W. Argyle St., offers items available in big-box stores, such as retail merchandise, electronics, appliances, clothes, toys and home décor, at discounted prices.\n\nThe business is run by co-owner Abdul Noman. The items inside the store come from overstock items or customer returns from big-box retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot, he said.\n\nRead more: What’s that Jackson? This store is like having Black Friday everyday\n\nAshley Outlet\n\nAshley Outlet moved into a 35,000-square-foot store at 950 N. West Ave., in early 2023. The storefront was previously occupied by Art Van Furniture until it closed in 2020.\n\nRead more: Jackson’s Art Van Furniture on list of stores to close this spring\n\nAshley Outlet features a wide range of furniture that covers an entire range of budgets, officials said. The Jackson store also features a full mattress gallery.\n\nRead more: Ashley Outlet is opening a new store in Jackson\n\nThe Wilderness Maven\n\nBulk herbs, tinctures and other wellness products can be found in downtown Marshall. Jenn Ziegler-Sherman, with help from her husband Zach Sherman, celebrated the official grand opening of the herbal apothecary called The Wilderness Maven at 211 E. Michigan Ave. in early June.\n\nZiegler-Sherman is an herbalist, meaning she works with different plants and herbs for health and wellness.

Michigan Ave., in April, adding to the list of Los Tres Amigos locations in Jackson County. This location, however, operates as an “in-and-out” restaurant, where guests come in or call, make an order and get their food, Los Tres Amigos owner Ruffy Ramirez said.\n\nThe assembly-line style restaurant is the first of its kind for Los Tres Amigos, Ramirez said. It offers a limited menu, including burritos, bowls, tacos, chimichangas, quesadillas, nachos and sides, as compared to the other restaurants.\n\nRead more: What’s that? A new style of Los Tres Amigos restaurant is coming to Jackson\n\n21 Blooms Tattoo Studio\n\nEmily Radke has been a tattoo artist for roughly nine years and has worked at several tattoo shops across the country.\n\nShe started her own tattoo shop, 21 Blooms Tattoo Studio, in a small 9-foot-by-11-foot space inside Airport Landing Plaza, 3200 Wildwood Ave. It was a one-person show for a couple years before her neighbors at Legacy 517 decided to move to a more favorable location in the plaza.\n\nThe expanded tattoo shop opened in December and offers a more upscale, personal and inclusive environment, compared to what some may imagine a tattoo shop to be like.\n\nRead more: What’s that? A new place to get a piercing or tattoo is coming to Jackson\n\nKeniKakes & More\n\nKeniKakes & More moved into a new brick-and-mortar location thanks to help from a revitalization project. Shakanna Blake opened KeniKakes in 2019, moving a year later into a building on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive with C Store Deli.\n\nShe left that partnership a year later and has been operating out of a food truck since. However, she was able to move back into a brick-and-mortar store in February at 107 Hague Ave., when she was approached by Jackson’s Black Excellence to help make that happen.\n\nRelated: Local Eats: KeniKakes & More in Jackson provides unique mix of sweets, soul food\n\nThe café, bakery and caterer offers a diverse range of sweets, soul food and home-cooked meals.

The two operated out of a tent for alast year but hosted an official grand opening for the bar cart in May.\n\nThey focus on making non-alcoholic drinks that people staying sober can enjoy. The experience is for adults 21 years old and older who don’t want to just drink juices or sodas at parties and events.\n\nAll of the drinks are crafted using zero-proof alternatives of vodka, gin, tequila or rum, making them entirely alcohol free. A mixer is then added, along with some alcohol-free bitters to add some bite that would be missing.\n\nRead more: Stay sober, but still enjoy a drink at Zero Bar & Lounge in Jackson\n\nHMN Style\n\nScott Pienta started HMN Style as an online store in 2021 before turning it into a physical storefront in Hillsdale to increase its storage size. After the store experienced much success, Pienta decided to expand its outreach with a second location in downtown Jackson.\n\nHMN Style, which stands for Hometown Media Network, moved into the former Apricot Lane location inside the Blake Building, 180 W. Michigan Ave. The new clothing boutique features women’s clothing, shoes, purses, jewelry and other accessories.\n\nRead more: What’s that? A Hillsdale boutique is opening a new location in downtown Jackson\n\nBalloon Art By Monica\n\nMonica Wieand has been running Balloon Art By Monica since 2022, after she made superhero designs out of balloons for her son’s party and saw how much the kids loved it.
