        "text": "Staff Reports\n\nLocals now have an affordable and convenient option in town when shopping for prescription eyewear. Optical retailer Eyemart Express, known for making high-quality glasses in as little as 30 minutes, is opening its first store in San Marcos on Monday, Jan. 17. The new San Marcos store is in the Guadalupe Crossing shopping center, 200 N. Interstate 35, and marks the retailer’s 13th location in Central Texas.\n\nAround a dozen new jobs are created with the store opening, ranging from full- and part-time sales associates to lab technicians and opticians. Eyemart Express offers a variety of training and development programs to cultivate career paths in the optical industry along with a competitive benefits package for all associates.\n\n“Demand has grown in Central Texas for affordable, high-quality eyewear that you can wear home on the same day, and now we can immediately help customers in San Marcos see clearly at our newest location,” says Daniel Medina, manager of the new San Marcos Eyemart Express. “You will save time and money when you shop with us because our expert opticians and lab technicians handle everything on-site. Convenience and value are so important, especially during this time of year. We make prescription eyewear accessible to everyone and every budget.”\n\nAt Eyemart Express, gone are the days of waiting two weeks or longer for new glasses. The new San Marcos store has an on-site lab and skilled lens technicians who can make high-quality glasses and prescription sunglasses in as little as 30 minutes. The retailer carries more than 2,000 frames at accessible price points for the whole family from brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, Nike, and Disney.\n\nPrices for glasses start at less than $40 for two pairs. Eyemart Express focuses on community giving, and offers everyday discounts for additional savings to veterans, military families, first responders, health care workers, and school faculty and staff members.\n\nSan Marcos residents can either visit the independent Doctor of Optometry next door to the new Eyemart Express store for an eye exam or they can bring in an existing prescription from their eye doctor.\n\nVisit the new Eyemart Express in San Marcos at Guadalupe Crossing (https://www.eyemartexpress.com/get-glasses/San-Marcos/78666) to see clearly with same-day glasses.\n\nAbout Eyemart Express"
