        "text": "Eyemart Express to open first Spokane location\n\nEyemart Express, a Texas based chain of vision clinics is heading our way and will open in the coming months at 7808 N. Division. This is the former Apollo Spas store building that has since been remodeled into a small shopping center. The same shopping center that also recently became the home of the Spokane area's first Firehouse Subs as well.\n\nThe company has been around since the early 90's when they we're founded in Appleton,Wi. At some time in their history they relocated their HQ to Farmers Branch,TX where today the home office oversees 162 stores in 34 states and an ecommerce website. And, while this will Eyemart Express' first Spokane location, it's not the first in this part of the country as the company already has a store in the Tri-Cities.\n\nEyemart Express sells contacts and many different glasses options in addition to their locations offering eye exams via an indpendant Doctor of Optometry that practices on site. The chain also offers several deals like a second pair of glasses free with insurance and lower then average pricing.\n\nBuilding permits have been pulled to build out the new Eyemart Express store but no official opening date has been announced just yet. For more information on Eyemart Express visit their website at-\n\nhttp://eyemartexpress.com\n\nRedevelopment Opportunity- Al's Motel hits the market\n\nFirst of all, as of my writing this there are no actual re-development plans actually in the works for the Al's Motel building. This is simply a post to promote \" what could be \" to some of the readers of this site that may have a few more dollars in bank then I.\n\nWith that said Al's Motel at 1417 N. Division is not be the top of the line. And although I'm sure it's mostly perfectly fine guests coming and going from the business, we all have likely hear it mentioned on the news at least once. So, it's not really too big of surpirise when I found it going up for sale on the CRE website LoopNet.com this week. But, this in itself is actually big news!\n\nThat's because if you haven't noticed, many changes have been happening in the neighborhood around it. People are taking note of this stretch of Division and Ruby's closeness to both Gonzaga and Downtown. Many more people have moved in with the opening of 940 North apartments and a couple of other projects and business owners are investing in their sites as well. Including a new modern apartment building that will likely rise soon behind the Starbucks at Mission & Ruby ( more on that yet to come... )\n\nSo, the saying location, location , location is really ringing true for Al's Motel right now which is now available for sale from SVN Cornerstone for just $500,000. The motel offer 18 rooms, with 4 of those rooms being full apartments and an office area. For a reasonable price a developer could easily convert it into a boutique hotel or apartment complex or who knows?\n\nWith projects like the re-development of the Wonder Bread factory building underway there is likely not a better time to start a project like this. I don't claim to be an expert at real estate by any means but a change to the building would likely be welcomed in the neighborhood and the community.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat other Spokane area buildings / lots would you like to see be rehabbed into something new?\n\nTell us in the comments section of this post of our Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/inlandnorthwestbusinesswatch\n\nBrothers Office Pizza / Specialty Training to join new shopping center in Spokane Valley\n\nConstruction of the building shell is complete for a new neighborhood style shopping center at 12930 E. Mansfield Ave. in Spokane Valley. And, now that the building is up construction can now get underway for the tenants that will occupy the new 7000 square foot structure. The center is along Mansfield , by the Granite Point Apartment complex and walking distance from Centerplace Event Center and the YMCA.\n\nHere is a look at the building as it appears today-\n\nThe businesses opening in the building will be-\n\nBrothers Office Pizzeria\n\nThis will be the third location of Brothers Office Pizzeria which also operates locations in Liberty Lake and further south in the Valley.\n\nBrothers Office Pizzeria says they are a family ran business with handcrafted pizzas, sandwiches and more. Their locationS also have beer, wine and spirits.\n\nSpecialty Training, Inc.\n\nSpecialty Training, Inc. a fitness center / personal training business will relocate their Valley location to two of the bays within the new shopping center. They also plan to keep their original location in the Downtown's Paulsen Center building open for business.\n\nSpecialty Training,Inc. is planning to be open there by Oct. 1st . With full facilities and classes.\n\nThe for lease sign also remains out front of the building implying that the two businesses won't occupy the whole building. Leaving some space likely still available for another business to open there. SDS Realty,Inc. is the listing agent of the center and with over 1000 residential units now within a half a mile of the building this space is perfect for many different types of neighborhood businesses.\n\nTuesday Morning opening soon in Spokane Valley\n\nIt's Tuesday morning, so there really is no better time to break the news that the Tuesday Morning chain will open a new store in Spokane Valley soon. This will be their second store in the Spokane area and the third in the Inland Northwest.\n\nBuilding permits have yet to be pulled, but a sign has appeared in the last few days out front of the site. The store will be in a newly built 12,500 square foot building nearby Spokane Valley Mall. The store will join the in-line spaces of the Evergreen Crossing shopping center at E. Indiana and Evergreen Rd., which is also home to Hobby Lobby, Total Wine & More and a handful of other businesses.\n\nTuesday Morning is a Dallas,TX based chain that primarily focuses on closeout home goods, gifts and home décor items with many popular brand names. The company has been adding locations and in all has a few hundred locations nation-wide.\n\nNo opening date has been announced as my writing this. Tuesday Morning's other area stores can be found at 9316 N. Division in the Heritage Village shopping center and at 227 W. Appleway in Coeur d' Alene both of which are to remain open for business after the new store opens.\n\nMore information about Tuesday Morning can be found at their website-\n\nhttp://www.tuesdaymorning.com\n\nNew gaming bar called Geeksnglory coming to Spokane Valley\n\nCalling all my gamers, it is finally happening, a new gaming bar is setting up shop and should be open for business sometime within the next few months in Spokane Valley.\n\nIt is to be called Geeksnglory and will be a locally owned and operated bar with gaming theme. The owners are working on getting everything together and just recently applied for a state liquor license. The bar will be located in a leased space at 6710 E. Sprague Ave, just to the east of the intersection of Sprague and Thierman Rd .\n\nGeeksnglory will boast both and indoor bar and a seasonal outside patio area. They also tell me they will have both retro and current consoles , virtual reality and a huge library of games. Beer, wine , liquor and some snacks will be served.\n\nOnce open Geeksnglory plans to also host game tournaments, cosplay contests, streamed game tournaments, video game giveaways and much more. Although not official yet, they hope to open around the first part of October.\n\nWe'll keep a close eye on it. They will have a website set up soon at -\n\nhttp://www.geeksnglory.com\n\nAnd, they can be found on Facebook at-\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/geeksnglory\n\nPlanning underway for another hotel at Spokane International Airport\n\nMost are aware that two franchised hotels sit just a short walk east of the main baggage claim at Spokane International Airport ( Ramada and Wingate Inn ). While most every airport with commercial flight service has a hotel close by, Spokane is one of only a few with hotels being close enough for guest to walk to and from via a safe sidewalk from the terminal right up to the lobby.\n\nAnd, if the planning continues to work out a third hotel, will soon join that same area. This time the new hotel will likely be closer yet then the others. This is due to a land lease setup being ironed out between the Airport and an Illinois based hotel developer. Decatur,Ill based Tharaldson Hospitality Management is purposing building their new hotel on land that is currently used as an surface parking lot for the Airport. This would be located in the gap in-between outbound Airport Dr. and the exit booths for the parking areas.\n\nThe hotel is purposed to be a franchised location of the Staybridge Suites chain, which is modern suite like hotel branding. The Spokane Airport Staybridge Suites would be a 4 story building with about 110 hotel rooms and most amenities common of mid range chain hotels.\n\nBecause planning is still on going as of my writing this, there is no set opening date just yet. It should be noted however that Tharaldson Hospitality Management is also planning to be construction another Staybridge Suites in Coeur d' Alene near the entrance to Riverstone development. That hotel is supposed to open sometime early next year, so we can guess that they are hoping to also open at Spokane International Airport sometime in 2018.\n\nThis is just one phase of some big plans coming in the near future to Spokane International Airport. The Airport plans to build a gas station / c-store not far to the east of this new hotel site in the coming months, big changes are coming soon to the shops/restaurants in the rotunda area and we're hearing about some new plans for the C concourse gates.\n\nFor more information about Spokane International Airport, visit-\n\nhttp://spokaneairports.net\n\nAnd, for more information on Tharaldson Hospitality Management, visit-\n\nhttp://tharaldsonhm.com\n\nFacebook edition- local new business openings & closings - Aug. 16th 2017\n\nOk, it's time again to look at what new businesses are opening , expanding or sadly closing in the Spokane and Coeur d' Alene area.

Division at the base of the Division St. Hill.\n\nAnd now, while technically under a slightly different name, they are taking their recipe for marketing furniture to North Idaho. This with the about to open Overstocked Mattress & Furniture coming soon to the Prairie Shopping Center, by the US 95 / Prairie Ave intersection in Hayden.\n\nOverstocked Mattress & Furniture will occupy much of the space that was last used by a Hancock Fabrics store. From what I've heard another portion of the space will also become a Idaho State Liquor Store but more on that later.\n\nThe new store will open for business as a soft opening today ( Fri. Aug. 11th ) . They will also have a grand opening celebration on Aug. 18th . The store carries a bit of everything from couches , sectionals, full beds , recliners and of course mattresses. And largely because of their overstock business concept their merchandise is discounted and usually marked significantly less then the other furniture stores. And, on top of all of that Overstocked Mattress & Furniture is a locally owned and operated business.\n\nOverstocked Mattress & Furniture will be open Mon-Sat. 10-7 and Sunday 12-5 . For more information about they're store find them on Facebook or visit their website at-\n\nhttp://www.cdaoverstock.com\n\nLarge self storage operation to be built across from Valley Wal-Mart on Broadway\n\nI'll admit there isn't too much exciting about self storage places. Sure they are a necessity for many and probably make a good profit for the business owner, but when it comes to getting posted on this site I tend to shy away as they're not big attention getters.\n\nBut this one I figured I should mention ahead of time as it will be quite large and built in an area with several big box retailers. This way we can hopefully curtail the rumors of other big businesses opening on the site....\n\nLocal developer Lanze Douglass is currently in the SEPA application phase to develop another location of his company's Secure It Self Storage at 15702-15722 E. Broadway Ave in Spokane Valley. This would be the site behind Numerica Credit Union and facing the shopping center with Wal-Mart / Dress Barn / Toys R Us, etc... .\n\nThis is the second new Secure-It Self Storage location currently under development as another in also in the works in North Spokane near the corner of Nevada & Magnesium . The new Spokane Valley location will be large and offer both indoor and outdoor storage spaces. In all the site will offer 600 storage units , a rental office and paved areas for RV storage.\n\nThe developer hopes to begin construction at the site as early as this fall or whenever he is able to pull permits for the land. The storage units would then likely open for business early in 2018, currently the comment period for SEPA application is open till the end of the business day on Aug 22nd.\n\nSecure It Self Storage is actually a small local chain of self storage facilities. They already have 5 locations in the Spokane area and one in Tacoma.

The chain which has been growing quickly since it's inception in 2007 is working on opening their first location in Spokane. They will occupy a space at the North Pointe Shopping Center, in what appears to be the spaces in-between Total Wine & More and Safeway.\n\nThis new location will be a franchise of the Encino,CA based chain of frozen yogurt stores. While it will be Spokane's first , it's far from the first. Menchie's operates over 540 locations with locations around the United States and far off lands like England, Kuwait, UAE and more. All of this expansion has come since the company's first store opened in California just a little more then 10 years ago. The company has even been highlighted on a past episode of the TV show Undercover Boss.\n\nMenchie's Frozen Yogurt isn't too much different that all of the other frozen yogurt stores that now dot the landscape with a self service concept and plenty of toppings. However they do have a large selection of flavors that even includes low fat, low carb , sorbet and no sugar added options, check with the store however to see what flavors are currently available. They also sell custom frozen yogurt cakes great for birthdays and most any special occasion.\n\nThe Spokane Menchie's will be located at 9986 N. Newport Hwy. . Watch our Facebook page for more news on when this location will open as we don't have the opening date just yet.\n\nFor more information Menchie's Frozen Yogurt, visit-\n\nhttp://menchies.com\n\nTwo new Burger King locations to take over a couple of less traditional restaurant sites\n\nRegardless of how you fell about it fast food chains like Burger King can be found everywhere. And it looks like Burger King is trying to increase their chain's presence in the Spokane market as 2 new building permit filings showing new locations coming soon.\n\nBurger King also recently opened a new location on N. Division just south of Northtown Mall a couple of years ago now. And, they also purposed a location on the site of the former Shari's restaurant on N. Monroe but have since abandoned the plans for that store due to a confliction with their planned drive through and the City of Spokane rules and regulations in the part of the city.\n\nWhat's interesting about these 2 new planned Burger King's is they both will not be in traditional stand alone locations and both are already occupied by other restaurants.\n\nThe 2 new planned Spokane Burger King's are at-\n\n- The front entrance of the Spokane Valley Wal Mart at 15727 E. Broadway. Here the new Burger King will replace the existing McDonald's.\n\n- Inside the rotunda food court of Spokane International Airport ( after security ) . The permit just says it's for demo and build out of the new Burger King so it's unclear which of the 5 restaurants the new Airport Burger King will replace. It may replace more then one? possibly...\n\n( My guess is the Quizno's as that store is actually the last Quizno's open in Spokane )\n\nBurger King is well Burger King, a fast food burger chain based in Miami,FL . The chain operates stores ( mostly as franchises ) all over the world, today there is more then 15,000 Burger King restaurants. They have come along way since launching as \" Insta-Burger King \" in 1950's Jacksonville,FL.\n\nFor more information on Burger King, visit their website at-\n\nhttp://www.bk.com\n\nNew Spokane Valley Sportsman's Warehouse to host grand opening tomorrow!\n\nAnnounced back in March, the area's newest Sportsman's Warehouse store is now open for business with a grand opening celebration planned for tomorrow morning ( Aug. 3rd, 2017 ) . The new store occupies what once was a Sports Authority store at 15118 E. Indiana Ave, just a short trip to the east of Spokane Valley Mall.\n\nThe new store occupies the entire 32,000 square foot space next door to a Home Goods and a Joann Fabrics. It sells all of the sporting goods and outdoors merchandise items one expects from the Utah based Sportsman's Warehouse chain. They offer departments for hunting ( including firearm sales ) , fishing/marine, camping, clothing, shoes/waders and more.\n\nThis is the chain's second location in Spokane but they are not new to the area, the chain once had 3 stores in the Inland Northwest. All of those closed however to reorganize the company a few years back. Their first store to return the companies presence to the Inland Northwest is the store at 6720 N. Division which will also remain open.\n\nWith the opening of this store Sportsman's Warehouse will operate 84 retail locations in 22 states, it will be the 11th store in Washington State. The grand opening will begin at 8:30am Thursday morning with the first 200 shoppers to though the door to receive a $20 gift card and a free Sportsman's Warehouse hat. A large celebration will also kick off the morning with members of the community like Rod Higgins, Mayor of Spokane Valley and many more on hand to speak and welcome the company back to Spokane Valley. If you can't make it for the morning celebrations sales will continue sales, give away's and factory representatives on site for some time after.\n\nThis looks to be the only new Sportsman's Warehouse store planned to open in our area at this point in time.
