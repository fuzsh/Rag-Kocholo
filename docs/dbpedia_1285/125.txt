Eyemart Express, a leading national optical retailer known for providing affordable and high-quality prescription eyewear in as little as 30 minutes, announces that Femi Enigbokan has been named the company’s first Chief Growth Officer. In this new role, Femi will focus on expanding the optical retailer’s footprint, which currently stands at 231 stores throughout the United States, and maintaining Eyemart Express’ position as a leader in the optical industry.

“I am pleased to have Femi join our Eyemart Express executive team as our first Chief Growth Officer,” says Michael Bender, Eyemart Express CEO. “Femi’s track record in expansion-focused leadership roles across industries will be a tremendous asset for our team and our ambitious growth goals. His global experience and perspective will also enable us to find innovative solutions that will best help our customers see clearly.”

Femi joins Eyemart Express after six years at Yum! Brands, the corporation behind KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and other fast-food restaurants, where he served in various leadership roles aimed at expansion. Most recently, he oversaw finance and real estate teams as the Chief Development Officer for the KFC Division in South Africa.

“I am proud to join Eyemart Express and contribute to its expansion momentum,” says Femi. “It has been exciting to watch Eyemart Express thrive and open new stores over the past year, which is counter to the current brick-and-mortar retail climate. I look forward to working closely with teams across the organization to disrupt the optical industry and extend the reach of accessible quality prescription eyewear.”
