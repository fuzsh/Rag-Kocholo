        "text": "Orthogonal Book Three\n\nGreg Egan\n\n368 Pages\n\nISBN: 9781597808163\n\nSeries: Orthogonal\n\nImprint: Night Shade Books\n\nTrim Size: 6in x 9in x 0in\n\nFormat:\n\n$15.99\n\nDescription\n\nHard science fiction’s grand master delivers the stunning conclusion to his Orthogonal trilogy.\n\nIn a universe where the laws of physics and the speed of light are completely alien to our own, the travelers on the ship Peerless have completed a generations-long struggle to develop advanced technology in a desperate attempt to save their home world. But as tensions mount over the risks of turning the ship around and starting the long voyage home, a new complication arises: the prospect of constructing a messaging system that will give the Peerless news of its own future.\n\nWhile some see this as a guarantee of safety and a chance to learn of their mission’s ultimate success, others are convinced that the knowledge will be oppressive or worsethat the system could be abused. The conflict over this proposed communication system tears the travelers’ society apart, culminating in terrible violence. To save the Peerless and its mission, two rivals must travel to a world where time runs in reverse.\n\nContinuing the epic multiple generation-spanning scope of The Clockwork Rocket and The Eternal Flame, Greg Egan’s Orthogonal series has continuously pushed the boundaries of scientific fiction without ever losing track of the lives of the individuals carrying out this grand mission. The Arrows of Time brings this fascinating space opera to a close.\n\nSkyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.\n\nAuthors\n\nGreg Egan is a computer programmer, and the author of the acclaimed SF novels Diaspora, Quarantine, Permutation City, and Teranesia. He has won the Hugo Award as well as the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. His short fiction has been published in a variety of places, including Interzone, Asimov’s, and Nature. Egan holds a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Western Australia, and currently lives in Perth.\n\nReviews\n\nIf you haven’t read any Egan, you so should. He takes the wildest frontiers of today’s science and turns them into brainbending speculative fiction that continually challenges the reader’s ideas of both reality and humanity.”\n\nJon Evans, author of Dark Places and The Executor\n\nrelated titles\n\nThe Best of Greg Egan\n\n20 Stories of Hard Science Fiction\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nTeranesia\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nDiaspora\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nDistress\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nSchild's Ladder\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nAxiomatic\n\nShort Stories of Science Fiction\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nQuarantine\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan\n\nPermutation City\n\nA Novel\n\nby Greg Egan"
