        "text": "Diaspora by Greg Egan is probably the most intense science-fiction book I've ever read. Intense in the way it brings highly detailed and technically difficult concepts and theories from the edges (and beyond) of current physics and presents them at length to the reader.\n\nIt's no surprise to me to see a large number of reviews for this book are mostly polarised into two camps; namely 'best book ever' and 'what the hell was that about?'\n\nPersonally, I lean towards the 'best book ever' camp, but not as forcefully as some! I enjoyed it and that is what matters.\n\nThis is a tough book for sure though. Even the opening chapters on the birth of a new digital mind will leave many people grasping around for just what on earth Egan is going on about.\n\nTo some, this has become an elitist badge of honour - those 'getting it' becoming reassured in their intellect and looking down on those that fail to see the joy in reading page after page of detail on the various processes and developments that go into creating new digital life.\n\nI wonder how some of those delighting in their own excellence at being able to understand Egan's depth would fair with Mrs Dalloway or The Return of the Native? Perhaps the shoe would be on the other foot...\n\nAnyway, it's not for me to say what people should and shouldn't enjoy and so this 'review' won't try to impress you with pity quotes and overeager attempts at grandiose statement. Instead, I'll just share with you how I managed to actually read this book.\n\nLearning to read difficult books\n\nSo here comes the big secret - write stuff down.\n\nAmazing huh? \"What incredible insight!\" I hear you quip.\n\nWell, try it. Honestly, write down items about the novel as you are going along. Write down places mentioned, characters name and descriptions, objects described, lifeforms, races, machines, concepts and more.\n\nKeep track of it all and come back to it when you see something mentioned and realise you've forgotten the detail of what it was or how it worked.\n\nI've provided my notes on Diaspora below so you can get a sense of what I mean. But the reality is, just keep notes, maybe in Evernote, maybe in a physical notebook, maybe in a plain text file or whatever. The details don't matter as long as it suits you and the way you like to read.\n\nTracking the plot\n\nThe next thing you should do is track the plot of the book. As well as writing down the detail, keeping a brief overview of the plot as is develops means you can come back to your own notes should you go a few weeks between putting the book down and picking it up again.\n\nWe're not all blessed with stable routines or time to sit and concentrate on difficult books for pleasure. So tracking the plot in your own words is the key to actually getting through to that all important last page.\n\nHow much detail?\n\nAs much or as little as you like. And you don't need to be consistent or keep things well formatted or even use whole sentences. Just do what gives you the info you need so that when you need to look back at your notes there's enough detail there to remind you about that particular thing.\n\nSame with the plot, sometimes you'll want to be more detailed as there might be more going on or maybe more intricate detail that you want to remember. Other times there will be no point putting much more than 'they went to X'.\n\nThe idea is to keep relevant notes that are easy for you to make and useful for you to refer to, not an essay designed to be used by others.\n\nMy notes on Diaspora by Greg Egan\n\nSo here are my notes then. I spent a fair while tidying them up to make presentable as I didn't really care what they looked like when using them to help read. After all, they were neat enough for me to understand and that was all that mattered.\n\nFeel free to change the format and make something that works for you, but I can't recommend strongly enough that you write whilst you read.\n\nTry it, it'll change the way you feel about reading!"
