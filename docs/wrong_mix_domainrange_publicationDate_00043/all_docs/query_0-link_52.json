        "text": "Distress is a science fiction novel by the Australian author Greg Egan.\n\nOnce again Egan grabs an idea and takes it to the limit, this time to the ultimate limit. In Quarantine he tackled quantum Mechanics, this time he takes on nothing less than the Theory Of Everything (TOE).\n\nThe year is 2055 and Andrew Worth is doing a documentary about Violet Mosala and her Theory of Everything. Andrew seems to have an easy job ahead of him, but as soon as he gets off the plane on Stateless, an autonomous island, where the Mosala is attending a conference on TOE, he is contacted by a mysterious person warning him about a possible murder attempt on Mosala. Things quickly pick up speed and soon Andrew has to fight for both Mosala's and his own life – and possible for the future and past of everything. Stateless is nearly worth a book of its own – it's the first description, that I can remember, of an functioning anarchy (in the book! In the book!) that is not working in some kind of vacuum. Quite interesting.\n\nEgan never ceases to amaze me – He's probably the best author today, when it comes to taking physics to its limit and still make it believable.\n\nReview by bon"
