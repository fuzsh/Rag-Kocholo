Introduction

The concept of “derivative works” is a cornerstone of intellectual property law, especially when it comes to public domain content. With the Fables comic series now in the public domain, many creators, including those in the Print on Demand (POD) industry, may be interested in creating derivative works based on this series. But what exactly are derivative works, and how do they interact with copyright law? Let’s delve into the details.

What Are Derivative Works?

Derivative works are new, original products that include aspects of a pre-existing, copyrighted work. For example, a novel based on a short story, a painting based on a photograph, or a remix of a song are all considered derivative works.

Derivative Works and Public Domain

When a work is in the public domain, it means that it is free for use by anyone for any purpose. This freedom generally extends to the creation of derivative works. In the context of the Fables series, this means that creators can freely use the characters, settings, and other elements of the series to create new, original works.

Copyrighting Derivative Works

Here’s where it gets interesting: while the original work (in this case, the Fables series) is in the public domain and therefore not subject to copyright, the new derivative work can be copyrighted. This is because the derivative work is considered a new, original creation, even though it incorporates elements from a public domain work.

Example: Unique Design Featuring Fables Characters

Let’s say you’re a POD business owner and you create a unique T-shirt design featuring characters from the Fables series. While the characters themselves are in the public domain and free to use, your specific design is a new, original work. Therefore, you can copyright this design, giving you exclusive rights to produce and sell T-shirts with that particular design.

Legal Implications

Protection Scope

The copyright on a derivative work only extends to the new elements you’ve added or changed. It does not extend to the elements from the public domain work. In our T-shirt example, this means you can’t prevent others from using the Fables characters; you can only prevent them from using your specific design.

Infringement Risks

If someone else creates a design that is substantially similar to your copyrighted design, you may have grounds for a copyright infringement claim. However, the claim would only be valid for the elements that are original to your design, not for the use of Fables characters.

Commercial Use

Since the derivative work is copyrighted, you have the exclusive right to use, distribute, and sell it. This includes using it in a POD business.

The concept of derivative works offers a fascinating avenue for creativity, especially when it comes to public domain works like the Fables series. While the public domain status allows for a wide range of creative freedom, the ability to copyright derivative works provides a layer of protection for new, original creations. Understanding this balance is crucial for anyone looking to explore the rich tapestry of public domain works in their own creative endeavors.
