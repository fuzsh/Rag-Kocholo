        "text": "The U.S. Constitution set the stage for Congress to pass copyright laws to protect creative works, but copyright protection does not last forever. The Constitution gave Congress the power to grant copyrights only for “limited times.”\n\nCopyright law protects a work from the moment the author creates and fixes it in a tangible form of expression, such as on paper, in a recording, or in a digital photograph. The length of copyright protection depends on several factors. Generally, for most works created after 1978, protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, or works made for hire, the copyright term is 95 years from the year of first publication or 120 years from creation, whichever comes first.\n\nWhen the copyright term expires, a work becomes part of the public domain, and anyone can use it without permission from the author. The public domain also includes material that copyright law never protects—such as ideas, facts, titles, discoveries, procedures, and works created by the U.S. federal government. Although copyright does not protect this material, patent or trademark laws might apply in some circumstances. Works in the public domain often inspire new works, adaptations, and derivative works, further enriching the country’s cultural landscape.\n\nLearn More"
