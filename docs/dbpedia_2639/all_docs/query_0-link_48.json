        "text": "Works created on or after January 1, 1978 are protected for a term of the life of the author plus 70 years. If it is a corporate author then the protection is for the shorter of 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation. Works created and published prior to 1978 may be protected for different lengths of time.\n\nFor example, author James Michener died in 1997. His works, such as Alaska, Texas, and The Eagle and The Raven, which were all created after 1978, are protected under the copyright law until 2067.\n\nFor more information regarding the length of a copyright, please see the copyright duration chart.\n\nThe public domain consists of all works that never had copyright protection and works that no longer have copyright protection. As of 2024, this includes works published in the United States prior to 1929.\n\nThe public domain also includes most works created by the United States government. For example, census reports, which are compiled and published by the United States government are in the public domain.\n\nAll works in the public domain are free for the public to use."
