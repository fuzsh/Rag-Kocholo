        "text": "© COPYRIGHT ©\n\nWhat is copyright, what is protected by it, and who owns it?\n\nCopyright is a law. In the United States the law is embodied in the Copyright Act of 1976 (as amended) in Title 17 of the U.S. Code. Copyright law grants to authors and creators of their works exclusive rights for using those works for a limited period of time. These protective rights encourage creators to continue to create and author new works. The law gives the creator the exclusive rights to:\n\nreproduce or copy the work;\n\nmake other derivative works based on the original;\n\ndistribute the works by giving, lending, or selling it;\n\nperform and display the work publicly if it is literary, dramatic, musical, or choreographed, a movie or other audio-visual type; and\n\nfor sound recordings, exclusively perform the work publicly via digital transmission.\n\nCopyright protects original works of authorship that is fixed in any tangible and perceivable medium at the time of their creation for the duration of the creator's life plus 70 years. The person(s) who created the work generally hold the copyright to that work unless it is a work made for hire or the creator transfers those rights to someone else. Works protected under copyright law are:\n\nliterary works;\n\nmusical works and any accompanying words;\n\ndramatic works and any accompanying music;\n\npantomimes and choreographic works;\n\npictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;\n\nmotion pictures and other audiovisual works;\n\nsound recordings; and\n\narchitectural works.\n\nNOT protected are ideas or concepts | procedures | processes | systems or methods of operation | principles | or discoveries, no matter the form in which it is described, explained illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nOwnership of copyright belongs to the creator(s) upon fixation in a tangible medium. The copyright in a single work may belong to more than one person if the work is the result of a joint effort. However, the copyright holder may have signed an agreement that the work was one made for hire and therefore, the hiring company or individual owns the copyright. In another instance, the author may transfer or assign his/her copyright to a publisher as a condition of publication and then the publisher owns the copyright to the work.\n\nDuration of copyright. Copyright ownership today in the United States lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. Once the copyright owner's term expires, the work enters the public domain. The public domain means that the work may be used freely without the former copyright owner's permission. NOTE: The U.S. celebrated Public Domain Day on January 1, 2019 (and for every year thereafter) when works from 1923 entered the public domain. Public domain works are no longer protected by copyright and may be used in any manner whatsoever.\n\nHow can copyrighted works be used?\n\nWith the copyright holder's permission, copyrighted works may be used by other people for a variety of other purposes.\n\nCopyright law also provides exceptions to and limitations on the exclusive rights held by a copyright holder. In some cases, a user does not have to seek permission from the copyright owner. The law includes these limitations and exceptions to help foster creativity of new and different works The exceptions, among other things:\n\nhelp others who want to use existing copyrighted works as inspiration for new and transformational works;\n\npermit libraries and archives to lend to or reproduce works for others research or preservation purposes; and\n\nlet buyers of physical editions to give, lend, or sell their purchased copy to someone else.\n\nFor example, fair use permits users to use bits and pieces of copyrighted musical compositions in mashups that incorporate new original music, or create parodies of original works, or allows quotes of portions of works in order to comment on the subject and make new understandings.\n\nThe exceptions allow the library to lend materials to its patrons, or make copies of portions of a work to send to patrons of other libraries, or make copies of works that are deteriorated or no longer usable on equipment for which it was originally made.\n\nThe first sale doctrine permits the owner of a CD or DVD to lend it to a friend or even sell it to an interested party.\n\nThese exceptions are explored more fully in the section Using Copyrighted Works.\n\nOther Considerations"
