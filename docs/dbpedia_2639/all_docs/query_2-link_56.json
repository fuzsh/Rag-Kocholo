        "text": "The UNC Libraries do not hold the copyrights for much of the material that is in our physical possession. The UNC Libraries digitize and publish online selected materials from its collections so that they can be discovered and used.\n\nWhile UNC Libraries can provide guidance on copyright for materials in its collections, it is ultimately the responsibility of the user to make the final determination about the legality of re-using materials from library collections. If you have questions about library policies in general or about the copyright status of a specific item, please contact the Wilson Library Research & Instructional Services department: wilsonlibrary@unc.edu.\n\nSomeone who wants to reproduce the material, distribute it, or make any of the other uses associated with copyright must get permission from the rights holder if that use exceeds the limits defined in a copyright exception. Note that under the current law, creative work that is eligible for copyright protection receives that protection as soon as it is fixed in a tangible form of expression. Because registration and notice of copyright are no longer required, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the rights holder.\n\nThe rights holderâ€™s exclusive rights are the rights of:\n\nreproduction\n\npreparing derivative work\n\ndistribution\n\npublic performance\n\npublic display\n\npublic performance by means of a digital audio transmission\n\nUnder U.S. law, in certain circumstances, creators of works of visual art have moral rights as well. In order to facilitate the re-use of our digital collections in personal, scholarly, and commercial projects, the library is making an effort to assign simple and clear rights statements to most items in its digital collections. These statements describe the copyright status, under current U.S. law, as far as it is known by the UNC Library.\n\nFor more about copyright and collections, please see the information provided by the UNC Libraries Scholarly Communications Office.\n\nCopyright Exceptions\n\nIf exception means \"In this circumstance, it doesn't apply,\" then copyright exception means \"Though normally all work is protected under copyright, this work's circumstance means you don't have to get permission from the owner.\"\n\nExamples of copyright exceptions include:\n\nFair Use\n\nPublic Domain\n\nMany copyright exceptions are limited and detailed in their scope.\n\nFair Use allows \"flexible\" reasoning\n\nFair use is a part of the copyright statute (17 USC 107) that provides a flexible approach to copyright exceptions for a wide variety of useful societal purposes. Such purposes for using fair use include (but are not limited to): criticism, comments, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\n\nFour factors are used to analyze whether a use is fair use:\n\nThe purpose and character of use, including whether the use is for commercial or noncommercial purposes;\n\nThe nature of the copyrighted work;\n\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;\n\nThe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nBecause fair use is a \"flexible\" application of copyright exception, it can be dangerous. If you decide to use fair use, clearly document your reasoning and store it with the rest of your copyright licenses. This could help protect you against a claim of copyright infringement."
