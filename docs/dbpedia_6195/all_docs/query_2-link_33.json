Mercer consults the Council regarding its private equity portfolio and performs due diligence on prospective fund investments. Private equity commitments are also vetted during public meetings of the Council Investment Committee, followed by a vote of the full Council. The Council currently has exposure to hundreds of private companies, through dozens of managers and more than 100 limited partnerships.\n\nNew Mexico"
