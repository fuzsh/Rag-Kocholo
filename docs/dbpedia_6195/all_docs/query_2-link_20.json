        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Platinum Equity announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in The Cook & Boardman Group (\"Cook & Boardman\" or \"C&B\") from Littlejohn & Co., LLC (\"Littlejohn\").\n\nLittlejohn will remain a significant minority shareholder. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nEstablished in 1955 and based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Cook & Boardman is a leading specialty distributor of commercial door and security integration solutions. The company offers a broad range of products including metal and wood doors, locks, doorframes, and other related building components for non-residential applications. It operates a network of more than 70 locations across 21 states, and services its customers nationwide.\n\nCook & Boardman's growing Security Integration division provides electronic safety and security products as well as communications products and solutions, primarily to education and government end markets.\n\n\"Cook & Boardman has built an impressive, diversified business with national scale,\" said Platinum Equity Co-President Jacob Kotzubei. \"Customers in this space want more than just a traditional distributor of doors and hardware. They increasingly need value added solutions, including electronic safety and security systems. We believe Cook & Boardman is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that growing demand for integrated solutions. We look forward to working with the company's leadership group and our partners at Littlejohn to continue growing the business.\"\n\nPlatinum Equity and Littlejohn have partnered multiple times in the past, including most recently as co-owners of Interior Logic Group, a provider of interior design and finish solutions for the homebuilding industry. The firms sold ILG in 2021.\n\nSteven Raich, Littlejohn Managing Director said, \"We are proud to have supported Cook & Boardman's substantial growth by expanding its footprint nationally and bringing innovative combined commercial door and security integration solutions to the market. We are confident that Platinum is the right partner to continue executing the company's growth plan and look forward to working with them as a meaningful shareholder to drive the next phase of Cook & Boardman's evolution.\"\n\nDavid Eisner, Cook & Boardman Interim CEO added, \"Littlejohn's proven ability to build and scale businesses has helped us successfully execute strategic acquisitions, expand into the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast markets, and build our Security Integration division over the past five years. Platinum's financial resources and operations expertise can now help us take it to another level. We look forward to working with Platinum and Littlejohn to support our associates in delivering market-leading solutions with exceptional service to our customers and communities.\"\n\n\"C&B competes in a highly fragmented industry with meaningful opportunities to grow organically and through additional M&A,\" said Platinum Equity Managing Director Nathan Eldridge. \"We expect to continue building scale in core markets while further expanding in specialty categories like safety and security. We have a lot of experience investing in building products businesses and believe we are well positioned to support Cook & Boardman's growth and ongoing success in the marketplace.\"\n\nPlatinum Equity's current building products portfolio includes Jeld Wen's Australasia business; Cabinetworks, the largest independently owned manufacturer and distributor of kitchen and bath cabinets in the United States; and PGS, a provider of hard surface floor coverings.\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close before the end of the year.\n\nBofA Securities served as exclusive financial advisor and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as legal advisor to Cook & Boardman. Latham & Watkins LLP is providing legal counsel and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is providing debt financing counsel to Platinum Equity.\n\nAbout Platinum Equity\n\nFounded in 1995 by Tom Gores, Platinum Equity is a global investment firm with approximately $47 billion of assets under management and a portfolio of approximately 50 operating companies that serve customers around the world.
