        "text": "What’s now?\n\nWe expect pressure to do deals to continue to build, as limited partners (LPs) become impatient for returns. This will manifest differently across the market. Mega fund-to-fund deals will remain subdued, given significant value divergence and more limited value creation opportunities. More unique megadeals — carve-outs, take-privates, purchases from founders or families — will likely be more prominent, given their greater complexity and resultant opportunity for value capture. Finally, we expect to see opportunity in the midmarket, particularly for investors able to look beyond financial engineering as the driver of return.\n\nWe’ll be keeping an eye on the Fed, but beyond that, a truer sign of health will be an increase in deal volume even while rates remain elevated. This would signal a move away from the wait-and-see of the last 18 months, and an increased focus on true organic value creation as the primary driver of deal success.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTo navigate the realities of today’s market, PE will have to continue to evolve. Where historically PE firms focused on cost reduction and operational rationalization, and recently, focused on financial engineering enabled by low-cost financing, the PE firm of the future must be laser-focused on business transformation to enable true value creation.\n\nDealmakers in this environment should focus on a set of key priorities:\n\nUpskill in digital and AI. Both at the fund and portco level, make strategic investments in talent and technology to unlock value and prepare for future seismic shifts.\n\nBring together deal and operating teams. Involve operating teams throughout the deal life cycle, leveraging their expertise early and ensuring alignment on critical value creation initiatives that underpin the deal thesis.\n\nUse M&A for capability expansion. Deploy add-on M&A thoughtfully, targeting differentiated offerings and capabilities that materially enhance growth or support improved efficiency."
