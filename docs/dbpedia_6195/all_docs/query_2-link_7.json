        "text": "Chicago, — Ryerson Inc., a leading processor and distributor of metals in North America and Asia, recently celebrated the grand opening of their newest service center located in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe new 54,000-square-foot facility is centrally located in the heart of the Salt Lake City business district. The facility houses a large offering of long products and serves as the hub for these products for Ryerson branches in the Western United States. In addition to the extensive inventory of long products, the facility also stocks a wide array of other product shapes in carbon, aluminum, and stainless steel. The processing capabilities include new state-of-the-art equipment for bar cutting, aluminum plate sawing, and sheet sheering.\n\nThis event marks the second opening of a new location for Ryerson in the Salt Lake City market in the last two years. In April 2009, Ryerson opened a 40,000-square-foot plate processing facility in Clearfield, Utah.\n\n“Our newest location allows us to better meet the needs of our customers in and around the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. We will be offering “same-day delivery” and “same-day will call” to allow our customers greater access to one of the largest inventories of long products in the Western United States, while our Clearfield facility will continue to house our plate and plate processing capabilities, including our High-Def Plasma,” said Roger Cundick, General Manager for both Salt Lake City facilities. “Ryerson is committed to Utah and the surrounding markets and we will continue to expand with our customers’ needs.”"
