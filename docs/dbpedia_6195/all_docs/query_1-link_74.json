        "text": "Platinum Equity Advisors LLC has offered to settle SEC charges over expenses related to potential fund investments that were not ultimately made, or broken deal expenses.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the company has agreed to comply with the regulator's cease-and-desist order. It will also pay disgorgement of approximately $1.7 million, prejudgment interest of $193,744 and a civil money penalty of $1.5 million.\n\nThe charges are related to three of Platinum Equity's clients that invested in 85 companies in which Platinum Equity affiliates also put their money. From 2004 to 2015, Platinum Equity incurred broken deal expenses related to the private equity fund clients and allocated all broken deal expenses to them. However, the limited partnership agreements that the private equity funds signed did not disclose that they would also be responsible for broken deal expenses related to the portion of investment that would have been allocated to the co-investors that are related to Platinum Equity.\n\nThe SEC has also found that Platinum Equity failed to adopt and implement a written compliance policy or procedure governing its fund expense allocation practices."
