        "text": "Mr. Lopez’ guidance was essential to Platinum’s bankruptcy bid to acquire Delphi, one of the world’s largest automotive parts manufacturers. The bid ultimately proved unsuccessful, but Tom Gores, Mr. Lopez, and the Platinum transaction team were the catalysts that brought GM, the US Treasury’s Auto Task Force, and Delphi management to execute definitive agreements on June 1, 2009. After Platinum’s work to win the support of these constituents, Delphi was able to emerge from a 4+ year bankruptcy process.\n\nHis contributions to Platinum’s mission, principles, and culture have been important factors in the development of the firm’s extraordinary teamwork, tenacity, and work ethic. He also helped to develop Platinum’s trademark M&A&O strategy and continues to work with Platinum’s M&A executives to ensure its successful execution."
