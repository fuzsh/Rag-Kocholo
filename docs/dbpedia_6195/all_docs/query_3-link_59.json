        "text": "NEW YORK, JULY 9, 2024: International law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP announced today that distinguished private equity dealmakers Tana Ryan and Navneeta Rekhi have joined the firm as partners in the Private Equity Group. Tana will be the managing partner of the firm’s new office in Los Angeles, and Nav will be based in the firm’s San Francisco office, which will be opening this summer.\n\n“The opening of our Los Angeles and San Francisco offices demonstrates Weil’s commitment to serving the needs of our current and future clients across all of the firm’s practice areas in these two critical markets. As we expand our private equity team and the firm’s footprint, we are delighted to do so with Tana and Nav – two top dealmakers with clients and practices that fit perfectly with our growth strategy,” said Weil Executive Partner Barry Wolf.\n\n“Tana and Nav bring exceptional experience and sterling reputations to the firm and are ideal partners to help build our new California offices as we embark on this next phase of expansion,” said Michael J. Aiello, Chairman of Weil’s global Corporate Department. “Los Angeles and San Francisco are significant markets for the private equity community, and this is a rare opportunity to expand our Private Equity Group, as well as to grow and enhance other practice areas across the firm’s global platform.”\n\n“The arrivals of Tana and Nav – and our office openings in Los Angeles and San Francisco – are significant developments for our Private Equity Group and the firm as a whole, but this is just the first step,” said Kyle Krpata, Co-Head of Weil's U.S. Private Equity Group, and based in the Silicon Valley office. “We have deep relationships with sponsors in both markets and are looking forward to working with Tana and Nav to add additional partners to our team and leverage our collective network to attract new sponsor clients. They are a perfect fit with our team-oriented culture, and we are thrilled to have them on board.”\n\nThe buildout of Weil’s new offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco will be a collaborative effort involving the current partners in Weil’s Silicon Valley office and across the U.S., as well as the addition of further laterals in several practice areas.\n\nBoth Tana and Nav are joining from Latham & Watkins, where they were partners in the private equity practice group. Tana was dually located in the firm’s Los Angeles and Century City offices, and Nav was resident in the firm’s San Francisco office. Tana and Nav will be collaborating with a presence in both Los Angeles and San Francisco to anchor Weil’s expansion on the West Coast.\n\n“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Weil’s new Los Angeles office as the Firm bolsters its West Coast presence and looks to capitalize on the thriving Southern California private equity market,” said Tana Ryan. “I was immediately drawn to Weil’s reputation for premier private equity work as well as its overall culture of excellence and collaboration. I look forward to working alongside my new colleagues in the Private Equity Group as the Firm opens this exciting new chapter.”\n\n“I could not be more excited to join Weil’s new San Francisco office and look forward to working with my new partners to expand the Private Equity Group and grow the Firm,” said Nav. “This is a unique opportunity to join an outstanding team as it expands across California and adds significant depth to its leading private equity practice.”\n\nAbout Weil’s New Los Angeles and San Francisco Offices\n\nIn summer 2024, Weil announced the opening of two new offices in California – having been a leading firm in Silicon Valley for more than three decades. Weil’s Los Angeles office is located at 1999 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1800, in Century City. In addition, Weil will be opening an office in downtown San Francisco. These two offices add significantly to Weil’s global presence and continue the buildout of our global private equity practice.\n\nAbout Weil’s Private Equity Practice\n\nWeil's global private equity practice is recognized by the industry as being one of only a very small number of elite market leaders in this field. Our clients include many of the highest-profile private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, as well as family offices and other equity financial investors.
