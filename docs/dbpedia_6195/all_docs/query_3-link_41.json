We dig deeper from day one to see beyond risks and complexities that can drive other financial partners away.\n\nWe seek to make equity investments from $50 million to $750 million in companies with $100 million to over $3 billion in annual revenue. Targets include corporate carve-outs, underperforming businesses, growth situations and family businesses in transition.\n\nWe have built a reputation for integrity, reliability and trustworthiness by consistently doing what we say we’ll do. Our experienced team conducts thorough upfront analysis that minimizes the chances for surprises late in the transaction process. After the deal is done, we’re true to the roles, processes and objectives we outlined at the beginning.\n\nBuilding great businesses takes time. We bring a partner mentality and culture to every investment, every step of the way. That means we’re flexible, respectful and easy to work with. We focus on building long-term relationships and value by enabling achievement. The proof? Those who work with us once tend to work with us again.\n\nAll information contained herein is for informational purposes only.
