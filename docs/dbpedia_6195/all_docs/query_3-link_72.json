The Seaside team has provided personalized attention and support to us in our day-to-day operations while giving us the flexibility and resources to continue to grow and achieve our long-term goals faster than we would be able to do so on our own. Seaside is committed to building a sustainable business that remains true to our values and our commitment to our employees, customers, and partners.”\n\n“\n\n“When we considered a transaction, we wanted to find a partner with the track record and expertise to help us grow and become an industry leader. Seaside has proven repeatedly that they seek to drive long term growth and value by implementing a detailed strategy, investing in growth initiatives and core processes, and acquiring other companies. Seaside members lead with respect and humility, and have been an extension of our team. I could not be more pleased with our partnership.”\n\n“\n\n“Partnering with Seaside has been an incredible experience. Since founding Cascade over 20 years ago, I have never been more excited or confident in what our team can do to grow our business, stay true to our core values, and support our clients by saving lives through world class training. In addition to finding strategic ways to use capital, Seaside has been instrumental in supporting initiatives that drive customer satisfaction, expand enterprise relationships and scale responsibly.”\n\n“\n\n“The experience of partnering with Seaside has exceeded my expectations. Their value-add is measurable not only with our strategic acquisitions, but also with our vision, core values, and organic growth strategies. At every turn, Seaside has supported our team’s focus on long term success: leadership development, key hire investments, and deeper levels of integration to unlock synergies. Their style is unique, with a blend of sincere curiosity, work ethic, and humility. Our successes at BlueThread Services: past, current, and future; are dependent on strong teamwork. Seaside contributes to this must have leadership ingredient.”"
