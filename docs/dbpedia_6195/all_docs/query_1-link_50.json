The yellow box-like building would have floor-to-ceiling windows, according to a rendering.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nIf approved, the apartments would take 20 months to complete.\n\nRead more\n\nResidential\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSale for nearly $34M marks priciest this year in Beverly Hills Flats\n\nResidential\n\nLos Angeles\n\nBeverly Crest site where Mohamed Hadid planned megamansion lists for $68M\n\nResidential\n\nLos Angeles\n\nAfter selling $200M Malibu estate, Bill and Maria Bell buy in Beverly Hills\n\nBeverly Hills’ Business Triangle, also called the Golden Triangle, encompasses the central urban business and retail section of the city, including Rodeo Drive. It is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard and Canon Drive.\n\nPlatinum Equity, led by Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores, is building new office complexes near the Sixth Street Viaduct in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIts proposed apartments would be built just south of a similar condominium building recently completed at 250 North Crescent Drive, according to Urbanize.\n\n— Dana Bartholomew"
