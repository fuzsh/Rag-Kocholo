        "text": "10,000 B.C.\n\nI suppose there's some entertainment value to be had from the sheer badness of 10,000 B.C. The movie takes itself serious enough that, viewed from a warped perspective in a state of inebriation, it might actually be fun. Seen in more mundane circ...\n\n2012\n\nIf, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made. Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAlien vs. Predator\n\nAlien Vs.

If the pandemic precludes one person from seeing Roland Emmerich’s Moonfall, then it has accomplished something positive.For two hours, I sat in a movie theater in a state of utter stupefaction. How, I wondered, did this movie ...\n\nWhite House Down\n\nWhite House Down is what it's advertised to be: a Roland Emmerich Film.
