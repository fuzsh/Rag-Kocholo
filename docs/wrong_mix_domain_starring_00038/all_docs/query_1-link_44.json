        "text": "It’s said 1 of 10 in the United States has been a victim of identity theft (with online proliferation I think this number will certainly increase). In Universal Pictures’ Identity Thief, Sandy Bigelow Patterson is a victim. The funny thing is Sandy is a guy in Denver and the thief is a woman in Miami. The stupidity ensues when the real Sandy heads to Miami to apprehend the fake Sandy. The movie has a strong cast supporting it, so hopefully it’ll be better than the trailer, which is above, lets on.\n\nIdentity Thief stars Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy, Jon Favreau, Amanda Peet, John Cho, Robert Patrick, Tip “T.I.” Harris, Genesis Rodriguez and Morris Chestnut."
