        "text": "Wreck-It Ralph\n\nFun Disney animated comedy about an under-appreciated video game villain (the eponymous Ralph, played by John C Reilly), who goes on an adventure to prove his peers wrong. Hilarity ensues, etc. Directed by Rich Moore.\n\nContagion\n\nGetting in the coronavirus mood with Soderbergh’s impressive hypertextual movie about a virulent pandemic sweeping the world.\n\nZootopia\n\nRich Moore delivers an even better animated delight than Ralph, with a fully realised world in which anthropomorphic animals rule the roost. There’s a coming of age story thread, a detective mystery, chases galore – all sorts. Cast includes Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate and Nate Torrence.\n\nThe Silence Of The Lambs\n\nI cannot watch that damn elevator SWAT scene any more.\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer\n\nVery watchable legal drama, with Matthew McConaughey as a maverick lawyer trying to figure out whether he has been stitched up by an influential client. Cast includes Ryan Phillippe, William H Macy, Michael Peña, Laurence Mason, Marisa Tomei and Bryan Cranston. Directed by Brad Furman (who gave us the fairly decent The Take, the so-so The Infiltrator, and the pretty good City Of Lies) from the novel by ‘Bosch’ writer Michael Connelly.\n\nFirewall\n\nReally rather dull 80s-style man-in-jeopardy thriller, with Harrison Ford doing his best bamboozled-yet-grumpy expression as a techie dude targeted by a gang wanting his assistance in committing a cyber heist. The main problem is that it’s boring and there is no sense of risk or danger. Virginia Madsen is wasted as his wife, Paul Bettaney is pretty good as the main baddie. Directed by Richard Loncraine, who in earlier years gave us the screen versions of Ian McKellen’s Richard III and Dennis Potter’s Brimstone And Treacle.\n\nNighthawks\n\nNever actually seen before, but certainly something I was aware of. Started out as a sober-minded drama about ‘Carlos the Jackal’ and urban guerrillas by way of a French Connection sequel, but ended up as a by-the-numbers hard-boiled cop buddy movie actioner.\n\nNew York cops Sly Stallone and Billy Dee Williams are recruited to a secret counter-terrorism team run (somewhat implausibly) by stalwart Brit actor Nigel Davenport in order to hunt down global terror kingpin ‘Wulfgar’ (Rutger Hauer). Chaos ensues. The action sequences are not by and large bombastic enough, but not is the overall tone or execution gritty enough. Definite case of falling between two stools. Scripted by The Warriors screenwriter David Shaber, initially helmed by Gary (Black Hole) Nelson before he was fired, with Sly temporarily directing until replacement Bruce Malmuth could arrive on set, it does have interesting moments, notably the London department store bombing, the bloody climax, and the scene in the night club. But no classic.\n\nJaws 2\n\nVery not great studio-mandated follow-up to Spielberg’s classic, with Jeannot Szwarc directing a contractually-obliged Roy Scheider. This time the focus is on a bunch of teens who just cannot STAY OUT OF THE WATER. The fucking mayor is back to his old tricks, shilling a luxury new hotel in cahoots with the Chief’s wife (Lorraine Gary) and a real estate developer (Joseph Mascolo), before… Yes, you’ve guessed it.\n\nNot much to commend it, but it’s not completely terrible, just very…not-Jaws.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nOK, so what we really wanted to see was Edgar Wright’s take on the story, but the version that actually got made – directed by Peyton Reed and co-written by leading an Paul Rudd – is still pretty good. The MCU mumbo-jumbo is dialled down, and emphasis is on a straight forward villain-becomes-hero heist movie.Great cast, including Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michael Peña, Walton Goggins, Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale.\n\nBad Teacher\n\nSelfish woman (Cameron Diaz) coasts as an entirely uncommitted teacher at an unremarkable school, but over time Comes To Learn Valuable Lessons About Herself And Life, etc. Quite amusing, with Justin Timberlake, Luy Punch, Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, Thomas Lennon and others showing their comedy chops off well. Written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, directed by Jake Kasdan.\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally\n\nNora Ephron and Rob Reiner’s classic love-ripens-over-time romcom, with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan perfect foils for each other, ably supported by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby.\n\nCharlie And The Chocolate Factory\n\nCan’t say that there was really much in Tim Burton/s Johnny Depp-starring remake of the Roald Dahl book that improved upon the Gene Wilder version. Certainly didn’t seem so much fun.\n\nThe Cat In The Hat\n\nVisually impressive screen adaptation of the Dr Seuss children’s book, with Mike Myers in the lead. Directed by Bo Welch.\n\nThe Silence Of The Lambs\n\nNineties movie comfort food, from Jonathan Demme.\n\nMr Bean’s Holiday\n\nActually pretty watchable big screen outing for Rowan Atkinson’s largely inaudible buffoon, on a trip across Europe (thingshappen, plans change, innocents are drawn in, etc. Affectionately put together.\n\nThe Silence Of The Lambs\n\nHam and liver, again.\n\nFury\n\nGrim, grimy war action from David Ayer, with dead-eyed Sherman commander Brad Pitt leading a battle-hardened tank crew (Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña) through Germany in the dying stages of WWII, supplemented by young replacement Logan Lerman. Not as meaningful as it seems to think, but not insignificant.\n\nHigh Crimes\n\nTrashy thriller from Carl Franklin (Devil In A Blue Dress), with Ashley Judd as a high-flying attorney defending her carpenter husband (James Caviezel) who is accused of being a soldier who committed an atrocity in El Salvador. With Morgan Freeman as an alcoholic ex-JAG lawyer she brings in to assist, alongside an inexperienced young officer (Adam Scott) and her flaky younger sister (Amanda Peet). The odd little twist, but nothing amazing.\n\nSnake Eyes\n\nExhilarating little De Palma flick, with Nicolas Cage as a bent-but-likeable Atlantic City cop drawn into a shady assassination conspiracy at a championship boxing match. With Gary Sinise, Carla Gugino and Stan Shaw.\n\nTraining Day\n\nDenzel Washington as a shark of a corrupt LAPD detective, constantly moving forwards in order to try and remain predator rather than prey; Ethan Hawke the straight arrow rookie partner forced to adapt or die, all during the course of a single day.\n\nThe Hunt For Red October\n\nSoviet submariner Sean Connery plays underwater chess with CIA analyst Alec Baldwin. Solidly helmed by John McTiernan.\n\nThe Silence Of The Lambs\n\nAnthony Hopkins hamming it up, Jodie Foster doing the wet eyed thing whilst hunting down a poodle-loving serial killer.\n\nHannibal\n\nAnthony Hopkins turns the ham up to eleven. At least Ridley Scott has a sense of humour about it all. Julianne Moore is a refreshing change from La Foster. Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta are enjoyablly camp, and there’s that fellow who was the obnoxious state governor in Oz too.\n\nHannibal Rising\n\nImpressively bad Hannibal Lecter prequel, with a previously hidden element of Bushido and all that. The wartime Lituanian stuff is mildly diverting, and there’s a sort of a 51st State reunion.\n\nThe Mighty Quinn\n\nBreezy but inconsequential lightweight stuff about a caribbean island police chief (Denzel Washington) investigating a murder in which his best friend is prime suspect. Plays up the Lilt advert stereotypes.\n\nAmerican History X\n\nOverdone American skinhead melodrama. Edwards Norton and Furlong are watchable, but it’s much less good than I’d been led to believe. That fat scientologist friend of Jason Lee is an extraordinarily unlikeable rocks-for-brains nazi.\n\nLe Samouraï\n\nAlain Delon as an existentialist French hitman-for-hire, who (let’s face it) fucks up big time. Blatantly ripped off for Leon and Ghost Dog.\n\nBlow Out\n\nBrian De Palma melds Blow Up to The Conversation by way of The Parallax View, JFK conspiracies and Chappaquiddick tittle tattle. Nancy Allen is hugely enjoyable. Travolta is wooden. John Lithgow is a very scary bad guy.\n\nDevil In A Blue Dress\n\nDenzel Washington as reluctant gumshoe Easy Rawlins in postwar South Central LA. No Chinatown, but good.\n\nRicochet\n\nAstonishingly bad (but breezy) thriller with Denzel Washington a hero cop turned pariah DA, framed by psycho bad chap John Lithgow."
