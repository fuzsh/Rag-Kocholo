        "text": "Yesterday we featured a brand new Japanese trailer for Roland Emmerich's 2012, which seems to have more death and destruction than we've ever seen before. Today Empire has three new display banners for 2012 designed to be displayed in movie theater lobbies around the country. At first I was just going to say they look pretty detailed, but then I started wondering, will destruction really sell this movie? All of the advertising for 2012 (which was heavily designed by Emmerich himself) has pretty much been all about the destruction - we haven't seen John Cusack or Amanda Peet's face anywhere. But will that sell audiences?\n\nAn academic researcher leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar. Cast includes John Cusack, Amanda Peet, & Chiwetel Ejiofor.\n\n2012 is directed and co-written by epic German filmmaker Roland Emmerich, of films like Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 B.C. previosuly. It was also co-written by Harald Kloser, of The Thirteenth Floor, The Day After Tomorrow, Alien vs Predator, and 10,000 B.C. as well. Sony Pictures is bringing 2012 to theaters everywhere on November 13th this year!"
