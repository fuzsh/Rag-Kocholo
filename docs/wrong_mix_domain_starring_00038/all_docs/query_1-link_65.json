        "text": "Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nBy ELVIS MITCHELL\n\neading a Jacqueline Susann novel is like watching a drunk disarm a bomb, an experience that makes you flinch and generates a freakish kind of excitement. The kind of lurid pulp that we now take for granted -- with titles that sound like soft-core porn movies from the pay-per-view channels -- was a genre that Susann took to a new, sweaty level with books like \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"The Love Machine.\" Humid novels about wide-eyed girl victims sucked into the world of sex, drugs, sex, celebrities and (gasp) sex while being romanced by heart-of-stone guys had been written before. But never in the way that Susann did, with the contradictory elements of pleasure in mining that mother lode of cubic zirconium and an undercurrent of sheer rage.\n\nTakashi Seida/Universal Pictures A tease of a diva: Bette Midler stars as Jacqueline Susann in Andrew Bergman's \"Isn't She Great.\"\n\nThat bile probably built up from experience. By the time she had become a novelist -- banging out copy on frosty pink paper with a matching Olympia typewriter -- Susann had had more careers (actress, model, etc.) than most people have socks. The new interest in Susann must be one of the things that drove the producers of \"Isn't She Great\" to turn Michael Korda's encounter with her, which he recounted in a New Yorker article, into a bio-pic.\n\nProbably the line that best sums up the Jackie (Bette Midler) of the picture is trilled by her friend Florence (Stockard Channing): \"Talent isn't everything.\" That sobriquet could apply to the movie as well. It's not that there's no talent among the collaborators. It's just that no one gets much of a chance to show it.\n\nNo one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva than Ms. Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic self-absorption than anyone else. And Nathan Lane, who plays Irving Mansfield, Jackie's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark plug: His voice shows up before he does. (That's why he's so good at animation voice-overs.) No one in his right mind expects much sexual chemistry between these two, but the ambition of Susann and Mansfield -- they were like separate species of predator circling each other -- provides a chemistry all its own. Yet in this adaptation of the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly hostility seems to be a facet of the writer Paul Rudnick's talent. But Rudnick and the director Andrew Bergman (\"The In-Laws,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas\") have so defanged \"Isn't She Great\" that it's like watching a sketch from the old \"Carol Burnett Show\" that has mildewed.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Another Life,\" Korda, an anthropologist in Susann's Land of the Drama Queen, was a smoothie from a show business family and smart enough, as her editor, to keep his hand out of her cage, or habitat, or wherever it is that such creatures dwell. And she seemed content to catch her reflection in Korda's gleaming blazer buttons. It was Mansfield, one of those producers without portfolio, who caught the brunt of Susann's rages. (Korda summarized Mansfield's role by noting that most of his life \"consisted of hanging around with his hands in his pockets telling people, 'Jackie will be down in five minutes.\"') But like most pilot fish, Mansfield saw an appetite worth trailing.\n\nAlthough Ms. Midler doesn't have the No. 2 pencil trimness of Susann, who turned up on 1960s talk shows as often as commercials for Fresca, girlish willfulness is a quality both share. Ms. Midler's presence -- soft curves masking pantherish comic reflexes -- is as old-fashioned as Susann's rough-hewn prose. \"Isn't She Great\" turns Susann and Mansfield into a couple of sweeties; they even wander into Central Park so she can have breezy chats with God.\n\nNo cliche is left unturned, complete with the conversion of the Korda figure (renamed Michael Hastings and played by David Hyde Pierce) into a stock, repressed WASP, a man who orders an American cheese sandwich with mayo. Pierce, who's on the verge of becoming a professional yuppie, was better in a small role as an editor in \"Wolf\" than here, where his Niles Crane character is stripped of two of its dimensions.\n\nThere are a few funny bits, like a scene of a woman moving her lips as she reads a Harold Robbins novel. The reteaming of Burt Bacharch and Hal David, who wrote the buttercream-rich theme songs that accompanied the film versions of several Susann novels, is a nod to Susann's campy standing. And John Cleese, an emblem of a '60s over-aged swinger as drawn by Jules Feiffer, is all comic confidence as Jackie's publisher. (He wears enough fabulously patterned suits to suggest that the Artist Formerly Known as Prince should check his closets to see if anything's missing.)\n\n\"Great\" also offers some oddly staged '60s references, like appearances by Jim Morrison (James Villemaire), Truman Capote (Sam Street) and even a \"Forrest Gump\" insertion of Susann/Midler into a clip from an old \"Tonight\" show with Johnny Carson. (Perhaps a miscalculation on a grand scale, since Ms. Midler's serenading of Carson on the penultimate \"Tonight\" is now legend.)\n\nBut \"Isn't She Great\" has a mandate to make Jackie Susann nice, because she's suffered. (Susann did suffer but had the good taste not to exploit it.) Too bad: Ms. Midler was born to play the Susann that Korda met. She has played this role before. Even Nathan Lane has played it, in \"The Birdcage.\" If you're looking for laughs, give \"Valley of the Dolls\" another read instead.\n\n\"Isn't She Great\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains drug use and the kind of language found in a Jacqueline Susann novel.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:\n\n'ISN'T SHE GREAT'\n\nDirected by Andrew Bergman; written by Paul Rudnick, based on an article by Michael Korda; director of photography, Karl Walter Lindenlaub; edited by Barry Malkin; music by Burt Bacharach; production designer, Stuart Wurtzel; produced by Mike Lobell; released by Universal Pictures.
