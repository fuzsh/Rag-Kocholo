        "text": "Highest Rated: 85% Please Give (2010)\n\nLowest Rated: 4% The Whole Ten Yards (2004)\n\nBirthday: Jan 11, 1972\n\nBirthplace: New York, New York, USA\n\nA scene-stealing role as an aspiring mobster in the comedy \"The Whole Nine Yards\" (2000) put actress Amanda Peet on the map, even though she spent years prior to that studying with one of the premier drama coaches in New York. She would return to drama in a number of notable films including Stephen Gaghan's political thriller \"Syriana\" (2005), but before being a part of that critical favorite, she suffered innumerable castings as one dimensional girlfriends and objects of desire in low budget sex comedies and big budget flops like \"Saving Silverman\" (2001). Her reputation became more favorable when she charmingly held her own opposite Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in \"Something's Gotta Give\" (2003) and was tapped by Woody Allen for \"Melinda Melinda\" (2005). From television work on series including Aaron Sorkin's highly anticipated series \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" (NBC, 2006-07) and the Duplass Brothers dramedy \"Togetherness\" (HBO 2015-16) to films ranging from the apocalyptic action flick \"2012\" (2009) to charming indie comedies like \"The Way, Way Back\" (2013) and \"Sleeping With Other People\" (2015), the maturing actress was fortunate to still find herself increasingly in demand for high-profile feature film work that required strong, beautiful, intelligent women who could hold their own with the boys.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n85% Please Give\n\n84% The Way, Way Back\n\n78% Changing Lanes\n\n75% Igby Goes Down\n\n73% Syriana\n\n72% Something's Gotta Give\n\n67% Two Ninas\n\n66% What Doesn't Kill You\n\nPhotos\n\nAmanda Peet Amanda Peet at arrivals for GAME OF THRONES Finale Season Premiere on HBO, Radio City Music Hall at Rockefeller Center, New York, NY April 3, 2019.
