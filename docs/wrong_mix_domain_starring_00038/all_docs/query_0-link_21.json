The new deal extends that relationship through May 2014.\n\nDavis’ 80-plus feature films and movies for television have earned more than $4 billion worldwide.\n\nHis productions for Fox have earned in excess of $2 billion. They include Will Smith starrer “I, Robot,” the “Dr. Dolittle” franchise with Eddie Murphy, the “Garfield” series featuring the voice of Bill Murray and the “Predator” and “Alien vs. Predator” films.\n\nDavis’ upcoming features include the comedy “Marmaduke,” starring Owen Wilson as the voice of Marmaduke, due for release by Fox on June 4; and fantasy-comedy “Gulliver’s Travels,” starring Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Jason Segel and Amanda Peet, for Christmas 2010 from Fox.\n\nEmma Watts, president of production at 20th Century Fox, said in a statement: “John and his team have provided some of our most successful films of the past several years. They have great taste, an eye for big ideas and the all-important ability to get pictures made.
