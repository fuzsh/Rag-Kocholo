        "text": "With one-time king of New York comedies Woody Allen continuing to work overseas - his next, \"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger,\" is set in London - writer-director Nicole Holofcener is taking over his reign with her chatty, likable comedy \"Please Give.\"\n\nHolofcener has a strong claim to rule, thanks to her family connections. Her mother, Carol Joffe, earned two Oscar nominations as a set designer for Allen in the 1980s (for \"Radio Days\" and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\"); her stepfather, the late Charles Joffe, served as executive producer on nearly all of Allen's films until his death in 2008. Holofcener even worked as Allen's production assistant on his 1982 film \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy.\"\n\nBut more than lineage, Holofcener shares storytelling similarities with Allen. In \"Please Give,\" dialogue is more important than camera angles, and the women in Holofcener's comedy have an opportunity to sparkle.\n\nAnd, unlike Allen, Holofcener creates grounded, utterly believable characters.\n\nKate and Alex (Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt) sell high-end vintage furniture, and their inventory comes from real estate sales and people unaware of the value of their late parents' possessions - which makes Kate feel guilty. Kate may portray herself as a liberal do-gooder who hands out $20 bills to the homeless, but, deep down, she knows she's a predator who profits on others.\n\nMultiplying Kate's guilt is a plan to buy the adjacent apartment of their elderly neighbor Andra (Ann Guilbert) so she can expand her home. The couple even becomes friends with Andra's grown daughters (Rebecca Hall, Amanda Peet), but it's all with an agenda.\n\nKeener has worked with Holofcener regularly since the 50-year-old filmmaker's debut feature, 2006's \"Walking and Talking,\" and theirs is one of the most enjoyable, fruitful collaborative relationships in movies. With Holofcener, Keener, who has provided strong supporting performances in such larger Hollywood movies as \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" gets the chance to play complex, credible, real-life, adult female characters - which explains why she seems to be so much at ease.\n\nAnd, in \"Please Give,\" Keener is at her best. Let's hope her creative partnership with Holofcener continues.\n\nPlease Give ***\n\nCast: Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet, Rebecca Hall, Ann Guilbert, Sarah Steele, Lois Smith, Thomas Ian Nicholas\n\nBehind the scenes: Produced by Anthony Bregman. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener.\n\nRated: R; adult situations, language"
