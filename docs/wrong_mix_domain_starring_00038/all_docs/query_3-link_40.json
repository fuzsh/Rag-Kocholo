        "text": "American actress Amanda Peet grew up in New York. She lived with her older sister, her father who is a lawyer and her mother who does social work. She knew she belonged in show business at the tender age of three, when she jumped up onto the stage in the middle of a play her family was attending.\n\nWhile Amanda Peet was at Columbia University studying history, her professor encouraged her to audition for Uta Hagan, the acting teacher. She later went on to study with Hagen for four years while also participating in an off-Broadway production called ‘Awake and Sing”. During the audition phase of her career she supported herself by working as a waitress at the City Crab restaurant in New York and with some money she had earned from a Skittles commercial.\n\nHer hard work finally paid off when she received guest star role in the hit television series Law & Order. The first feature film that she appeared in was Animal Room and afterward she found herself appearing in several indie films that never became popular. Her big break was in the hit comedy The Whole Nine Yards in 2000 with Bruce Willis, in which she played a somewhat ditzy but kind hearted hit-woman. It was this role that established her as a leading lady and later that year she made the list of People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People”.\n\nSince then, she has appeared in a wide variety of film, such as the comedy Saving Silverman in 2001 and Something’s Gotta Give, a romantic comedy from 2003. She also appeared in Identity, Syriana, Griffin & Phoenix, The Ex and the 2008 science fiction movie The X-Files: I Want to Believe. Her most recent film appearances were in the 2009 disaster film 2012 and in the family adventure film Gulliver’s Travels with Jason Segal, Emily Blunt and Jack Black. She was also seen in a guest star appearance in the popular television show How I Met Your Mother as ‘Jenkins’ in the episode of the same name.\n\nPeet has also spent her time volunteering with a non-profit organisation called “Every Child by Two” which advocates vaccinations for children. She became involved after she became concerned about the misinformation that was being spread about vaccines and the threat that dropping vaccination rates could put all children at risk of dangerous diseases that could have been prevented.\n\nAmanda Peet married David Benioff, a screenwriter, in 2006 in New York City. They have two daughters, Frances and Molly and the family splits their time between Beverly Hills and Manhattan.\n\nShe is currently working on two films at the moment, Identity Thief with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman and The Way, Way Back with Steve Carell, Rob Corddry, Toni Collette and Maya Rudolph. She also has a recurring guest starring role on the CBS television show The Good Wife, as a military lawyer.\n\nAmanda Peet is pictured wearing the Diamond By the Yard Necklace by KC Designs."
