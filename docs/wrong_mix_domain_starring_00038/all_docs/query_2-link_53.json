It hails from Amanda Peet (The Romanoffs) and Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. It marks the first series to come out of the mega overall deal Benioff and Weiss signed at Netflix last year.\n\nWritten and executive produced by Peet, who also serves as showrunner, The Chair centers on the chair of an English department at a major university. Annie Julia Wyman co-wrote the pilot.\n\nPeet and Oh executive produce with Peet’s husband, Benioff, Weiss and Bernie Caulfield.\n\nPeet most recently was seen in The Romanoffs and Brockmire. The Chair reunites Peet with Duplass, with whom she worked in Togetherness, created by Jay and Mark Duplass. Her most recent play, Our Very Own Carlin McCullough, debuted in 2018 at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood. She recently wrapped production on Season 2 of USA network’s anthology series Dirty John: The Betty Broderick Story and soon will start production on HBO’s The Gilded Age.\n\n2020 Netflix Pilots &amp; Series Orders\n\nOh currently stars in and is a co-executive producer of BBC America’s acclaimed series Killing Eve, for which she won Golden Globe, SAG and Critics’ Choice awards, along with two Emmy nominations and a BAFTA TV Award nomination. She also won a Golden Globe and SAG Award for her role as Dr. Cristina Yang on Grey’s Anatomy, as well as multiple Emmy nominations.\n\nDuplass began acting in 2012, when Jill Soloway cast him as series regular Josh Pfefferman in her Amazon series Transparent, a role for which he shared a Golden Globe Award for best comedy series and multiple Emmys.
