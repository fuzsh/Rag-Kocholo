        "text": "NEW YORK -- Amanda Peet is discovering there are benefits being married to a screenwriter.\n\nLast year, she wed David Benioff (\"Troy,\" \"25th Hour\"), who now helps her sort through the scripts.\n\n\"If the first 30 pages seem promising, he will read it. Sometimes, it's cusp-y and I don't know if something is really worth it. I give it to him and I do whatever he says,\" Peet says with a grin, sinking into a hotel sofa during a press day for her latest film, \"Martian Child,\" now in theaters.\n\nThe willowy, blue-eyed brunette is no longer typecast as temptress. She's been mixing it up as a character actress, making appearances in the Oscar-nominated films \"Syriana\" and \"Something's Gotta Give,\" along with Woody Allen's \"Melinda and Melinda.\" Working in different mediums and genres, she's moving towards parts on the softer side of the emotional spectrum.\n\n\"I'm just looking for really good writing,\" she says, describing how she makes choices in collaboration with her husband. \"Martian Child\" features Peet as an eccentric who bonds with a widowed sci-fi writer (John Cusack) and his adopted son (Bobby Coleman), a kid claiming to be from another planet. In the spring comedy \"The Ex,\" now on DVD, the New York native starred as a lawyer-turned-full time mom adjusting to life back in her suburban hometown.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut last year opposite Patrick Wilson in a revival of \"Barefoot in the Park.\" And she was a savvy TV executive in the Aaron Sorkin series \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\" which reteamed her with Matthew Perry of \"The Whole Nine Yards.\"\n\nPeet, 35, has yet to lead the cast in a commercial hit. Her biggest successes have either been ensemble pieces -- \"Identity\" -- or films that feature her in a supporting part -- \"Something's Gotta Give.\" She acknowledges that she's not in a place where she gets first pick at great roles.\n\n\"When you're a bigger star you get many good scripts sent to you and you choose which one you're going to gravitate towards,\" she says. \"I gravitate toward the best-written one that's been thrown my way after a lot of girls have passed on it.\"\n\nSorkin's pilot script for \"Studio 60\" got a strong endorsement from Peet's husband.\n\n\"He said 'This is one of the best things I've ever read, movie, play, TV,'\" she says. \"He gets jealous but he also gets really excited at the prospect that I would be in something that he loves too. The ego bust of reading something else great is nullified by the ego boost of having me in it.\"\n\nPeet critiques works in progress by Benioff, whom she wed in a Jewish-Quaker ceremony at her alma mater, Friends Seminary in New York. His latest project is a novel, \"City of Thieves,\" about the siege of Leningrad. She jokes, \"There's no f-ing part for me in it.\"\n\nPeet is now a working mom. She and Benioff have an eight-month-old daughter named Frances Pen.\n\nThe actress has played maternal characters in her last three films, including \"Syriana,\" in which she portrayed a woman who loses her son in a horrific accident at a party. She says it's a coincidence that her screen life mirrors her real life.\n\n\"Things are not that purposeful. It's not like I'm looking for roles about parenting or I'm unconsciously attracted to doing a thriller right now,\" she says. \"There's not that much forethought. I just try to get something that's respectable.\"\n\nPeet has endured a fair amount of disappointment in her career. \"Studio 60,\" Aaron Sorkin's follow-up to \"The West Wing,\" had been hyped as the show that would boost NBC back to the top of the Nielsen chart. Praise from critics didn't translate into big ratings and the network closed shop after one season.\n\n\"Aaron Sorkin was so famous and so applauded for his other work, there were massive expectations and then there was a backlash,\" Peet muses. \"I'm not saying the show was perfect, but I wonder what would have happened if it had been some 35-year-old newcomer writer.\"\n\nPeet's \"Barefoot in the Park\" revival got panned, making it daunting for her to go out in front of the audience nightly. \"It's hard to hold a really big house and it can be very difficult to learn about your reviews and then get back on stage.\"\n\nShe eventually started to have fun with it, inventing games to play with Wilson. One night, the actor told her to use her pinky any time she pointed towards something.\n\n\"I spent the entire play almost losing it. I couldn't get my lines out. I wasn't bored but I must have been horrifyingly bad.\"\n\nStudying with acting coach Uta Hagen, Peet established herself on the New York theater scene before she crossed over to television. She appeared on \"Law & Order\" as a Patty Hearst-type abductee and on \"Seinfeld\" as one of Jerry's girlfriends, a woman he's befuddled to find living with a male roommate. Guest spots led to a starring role in \"Jack & Jill,\" a cosmopolitan comedy that aired two seasons on the WB network. Her big-screen breakthrough was \"The Whole Nine Yards,\" in which she played a perky wannabe assassin. The sleeper hit spawned a sequel, \"The Whole Ten Yards.\"\n\n\"It was a tricky part to get right,\" says Jonathan Lynn, director of \"The Whole Nine Yards.\" \"The lovable hit woman, there's very few examples of that in screen history. Amanda made the part her own.\"\n\n\"Martian Child,\" directed by Menno Meyjes (\"Max\") and based on a short story by sci-fi writer David Gerrold, is Peet's first family film and her second picture with John Cusack of \"Identity.\" The decision to dive in was a \"no-brainer,\" she says.\n\nCombining comedy, drama and science fiction, the picture follows a lonely widower, David (Cusack) as he adopts a foster child (Coleman) who claims to have otherworldly origins. David, still lamenting the loss of his wife two years after her death, finds that single parenthood impacts him in unexpected ways.\n\nPeet plays Harlee, a friend of David's late spouse who offers words of encouragement, while Joan Cusack is on hand as David's skeptical sister, Liz. (The Cusack siblings have appeared in nine films together). When the production team was casting the part of Harlee, they sought an actress who could be a strong counterpoint to Joan.\n\n\"Liz and Harlee are like the angel and devil on David's shoulder,\" says producer Corey Sienega. \"Liz was all about warning him, 'You're not ready,' but Harlee was more nurturing. Amanda has such a kindness that radiates and such a level of acceptance of other people that we all thought she would be great.\"\n\nPeet reflected on her own childhood making the film. \"I went through a period where I looked like a boy and people thought I was a boy,\" she says. \"I guess I was really scarred by that ... I don't know anyone who didn't have a moment where they thought they were a total freak, no matter how popular they appear to be. I think everyone is haunted by a fear that they're weird and if you're not haunted by that fear, then you probably aren't ever going to be a good actor or a writer.\"\n\nThe daughter of an attorney and a social worker, Peet made a precocious stage debut at the age of 3, when her parents took her and her older sister to see a children's show.\n\n\"They said a phrase that my sister and I had been saying for a while. We had made up a song called 'I Beg Your Pardon,'\" she says. \"Someone onstage said 'I beg your pardon.' I went running up on stage and my mom was mortified.\"\n\nShe had an unconventional education, graduating from Friends Seminary, a Quaker school in Manhattan. \"There's more of an emphasis on creative intelligence as opposed to how many AP classes you can get into.\"\n\n\"The biggest thing is you have a meeting for silence every morning and on Friday morning you have a really long meeting for silence,\" she says. \"Most morning meetings I'd spend looking at notes for my biology exam. It was only later that I realized how special it is and how wonderful it is to sit with a lot of people in silence.\"\n\nAfter high school, she chose to major in history at Columbia rather than studying drama because \"I wanted to be cool and not be like, \"I want to be on stage.'\"\n\nShe got her degree and later took acting classes with Hagen. One of the roles her mentor assigned her in class was Corie in \"Barefoot in the Park,\" the character she ended up playing on Broadway. She drew upon Hagen's teachings to prepare for the show.\n\n\"She told me secrets about how to play (Corie) and taught infinite lessons about how to be on stage and feel real,\" says Peet, whose drama resume includes \"This is How it Goes\" by Neil LaBute at the Public Theater. Jeffrey Wright and Ben Stiller shared the marquee with Peet, playing romantic rivals in that 2005 production.\n\nPeet hopes there's more live performing on the horizon but at the moment, she's busy with film gigs. She'll soon be heading for Boston to shoot \"Real Men Cry\" with Mark Ruffalo and Ethan Hawke. After that, she's costarring with Catherine Keener in an untitled project by Nicole Holofcener (\"Lovely & Amazing\").\n\nShe wants to work with her husband at some point. Guessing what kind of character he'd write for her, she smiles, \"It would probably be a really naggy person.\"\n\nLisa Rose may be reached at lrose@starledger.com or (212) 790-4436."
