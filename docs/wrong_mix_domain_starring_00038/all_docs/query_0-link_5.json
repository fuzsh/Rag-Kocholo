        "text": "2012\n\nIf, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made. Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAdam Project, The\n\nThe Adam Project has much in common with last year’s Shawn Levy/Ryan Reyolds collaboration, Free Guy (notably the somewhat questionable “science” content in the sci-fi tapestry and well as some dubious plot points), but this film has a more ...\n\nAlien vs. Predator\n\nAlien Vs. Predator is a gimmick - an all-too-blatant attempt to lure fanboys away from their computer games and into theaters. It's not likely that the movie will be of great interest to anyone else, except perhaps as a curiosity. As an attempt to...\n\nAlien vs. Predator: Requiem\n\nHo, ho, ho - the joke's on anyone who pays to see this. Twentieth Century Fox has left movie-goers a steaming turd under the Christmas tree. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (which will hereafter be called by its \"clever\" marketing moniker, AVPR, sin...\n\nArena\n\nArena is one of those movies where there’s a strong temptation to assign a one-star rating (or less). Indeed, based on “traditional” reviewing metrics, this 1989 sci-fi throwaway is undeserving of any degree of respect. The story is a hodgep...\n\nBabylon A.D.\n\nBabylon A.D. has the look and feel of a skeleton: an unfinished outline that whooshes by so fast that it becomes incomprehensible as its storyline and characters are lost in a flurry of fast cuts and poorly choreographed action sequences. The film...\n\nBattle Los Angeles\n\nPerhaps it's a backhanded compliment to acknowledge that, as would-be \"event\" films about alien invasions go, Battle Los Angeles is superior to both Independence Day and Skyline. Nevertheless, the movie is likely to miss the mark for anyone in sear...\n\nBattleship\n\nLet me start this review off on a positive note. Battleship is in 2-D, not 3-D, so there are no issues with motion blur, low light levels, and general eye discomfort. There are some nice establishing shots of Hawaii; I might want to go there if I w...\n\nBumblebee\n\nWhen you’re a kid, you have your favorite toys. You play with them regularly and rigorously until, eventually and inevitably, you grow tired of them and move on. Then, if they’re good toys, someone else will pick them up and use them. Same...\n\nDoom\n\n(Insert appropriate remarks about how Doom is the perfect name for this motion picture.) Although I am not averse to wasting a few hours playing computer games, I have never tried my hand at Doom. Judging by sales figures and testimonials, play..."
