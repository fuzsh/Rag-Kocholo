        "text": "As romantic comedies go, \"A Lot Like Love\" is about as exciting and memorable as its bland title. Oh, the Ashton Kutcher-Amanda Peet outing certainly isn't offensively bad or shoddily made, it's just not inspired or original.\n\nIt's the umpteenth version of the tale in which old friends finally realize they're in love, after putting filmgoers through nearly two hours of hopefully amusing romantic ups and downs. (If \"When Harry Met Sally\" is the cream of the crop, this is 2 percent milk.)\n\nOliver (Kutcher) and Emily (Peet) meet \"cute\" (albeit a bit sleazily) on a flight from California to New York. Oliver goes into the airplane lavatory, only to be followed by a complete stranger (Emily) who immediately inducts him in the mile-high club. Oliver tries to give her his name, but she insists that ruins the moment.\n\nThen, in a coincidence one only finds in movies, they meet the next day on the streets of Manhattan and strike up a playful friendship. The film spotlights other moments over the next seven years when they either run into each other accidentally or look each other up. It's clear they're meant for each other, but it seems they each have to try alternatives before coming to the same conclusion.\n\nLaughs and romantic sparks are found but not in abundance. Each actor comports himself with reasonable ease, but the chemistry isn't especially explosive. English director Nigel Cole fared better with 2003's \"Calendar Girls.\" (Then again, the creation of a nudie calendar by small-town English matrons admittedly has a can't-miss quality.)\n\nRATED: PG-13 STARS: Ashton Kutcher, Amanda Peet THEATER: Royal Park\n\nA Lot Like Love"
