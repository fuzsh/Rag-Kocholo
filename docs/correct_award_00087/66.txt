His attention was drawn to the Slavic and English-language poets. By the end of the 60s his name is well known among the creative youth of Leningrad and in informal literary circles.

In February 1964, Brodsky was arrested. He was accused of parasitism. As a result, Joseph was exiled to the Norenskaya village, Konosha District of the Arkhangelsk region, for five years. In 1965, the expulsion period has been reduced by the decision of the Supreme Court. The poet returned to Leningrad. However, it does not mean the end of the conflict with the authorities.
