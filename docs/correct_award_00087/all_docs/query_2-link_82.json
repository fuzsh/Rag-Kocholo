        "text": "NEWS FOCUS\n\nNOBEL PRIZE WINNER FOR LITERATURE\n\nExiled Russian poet\n\na “hero” in his time\n\nJOSEPH BRODSKY winner of the 1987 Nobel\n\nU Prize for Literature is one of the great poets\n\nof the 20th century. Sydney writer RENEE\n\nBITTOUN pays tribute to Brodsky, a Russian\n\nJew who has lived in the West since his\n\nexpulsion from the Soviet Union in 1972.\n\n\"Because the art of poetry makes words necessary;\n\nI, one of the deaf, baldingf dismal emissaries\n\nof a second-rate power, caught up in this\n\nand not wishing to do violence to my brain,\n\nam outfitting myself and heading down to the kiosk\n\nto see what the evening papers contain,\n\nThe poem, The End of a Beautiful\n\nEra’, written by Brodsky in his home\n\ncity of Leningrad in 1969 a few years\n\nbefore his enforced exile in 1972, is\n\ntypical of Brodsky’s style; rich, lively,\n\nsadly humorous and often self\n\ndeprecating, traditional poetry\n\nmarked by today’s political\n\nexperiences.\n\nAlthough he is a hero to many Soviet\n\nJews, Brodsky is almost unknown\n\noutside literary circles in the United\n\nStates and Europe.\n\nIn Australia, few of his poems or\n\nessays have been available until recently.\n\nBut with the release of some of his\n\nwork this month, Australians will have\n\nan opportunity to read some stimulating\n\nessays by this exile.\n\nHe stands with compatriots Anna\n\nAkhmatova and Osip Mandelstam, as\n\namongst the foremost poets of this\n\n• century.\n\nBrodsky, who was expelled from the\n\nUSSR in 1972, lives now in the USA.\n\nHis story of political and racial\n\npersecution is not new, nor is his forced\n\nexile. But his capacity to view both sides,\n\nthe passion for his home and its people\n\nis evident, and the loathing of its\n\npolitical system is viewed with an\n\nequally critical eye on new-found\n\nwestern values.\n\nBorn an only child Brodsky grew up\n\nin a one and a half room flat in\n\nLeningrad, the city he felt to be the\n\nsource of great Russian literature, “the\n\ncapital of Russian letters” and whose\n\nlegacy today he has inherited. His\n\nparents were secular Jews-, his father a\n\nnaval journalist and his mother a clerk.\n\nAlthough both had university educations\n\nthere were no career advancements for\n\neither due to their Jewish “nationality”\n\nand their non-party membership.\n\nOf his parents, Brodsky has written:\n\n“lam grateful to my mother and father\n\nnot only for giving me life but also for\n\nfailing to bring up their child as a slave.\n\nThey tried the best they could — if only\n\nto safeguard me against the social reality\n\nI was bom into-to turn me into the state's\n\nobedient, loyal member”. Autodidactic\n\nin nature Brodsky left school at 15,\n\ntaught himself English and Polish and\n\nbegan by translating poems from these\n\nlanguages into Russian.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 24, Joseph\n\nBrodsky already noticed and accredited\n\nwith great talent by his peers, was\n\nbrought to an ugly trial, at a court where\n\nthe entrance sign read “Trial of the\n\nParasite, Brodsky”.\n\nHe was charged with laziness, and\n\nstood accused before judges who decreed\n\nthat writing and translating poetry did\n\nnot constitute real work.\n\nAbstracts from his trial read like a\n\nKafkaesque nightmare. None of the\n\nwitnesses called to testify against him\n\nhad ever met him nor read his work yet\n\nclaimed he was “a parasite, an oaf, a\n\nruffian, an ideologically filthy\n\nindividual” and called for his detention.\n\nThe diary he wrote as a 16-year-old\n\nwas produced as evidence against him .\n\nand none of his contemporary work was\n\npresented. This vile anti-Semitic and\n\nanti-intellectual trial led to Brodsky’s\n\ninternal exile for 5 years. He continued\n\nto write and translate poetry and in June,\n\n1972 he was forcibly spirited out of\n\nRussia. His immediate residence was in\n\nAustria at the home of W.H. Auden,\n\nwhose works he had translated.\n\nHe then went on to positions as\n\nvisiting professor and Poet in Residence\n\nat many American Universities. He was\n\nawarded an Honorary Doctorate of\n\nletters at Yale University in 1978.\n\nMuch of his work today is written in\n\nEnglish. As he explains: “Even if I had\n\nwritten all this in Russian, these words\n\nwouldn’t see the light of day under the\n\nRussian sky. Who would read them\n\nthen? A handful of emigres whose\n\nparents either have died or will die under\n\nsimilar circumstances? They know this\n\nstory only too well. They know what it •\n\nfeels like not to be allowed to see their\n\nmothers of their fathers on their\n\ndeathbed; the silence that follows their\n\nrequest for an emergency visa to attend\n\na relative’s funeral. And then it’s too late,\n\nand a man or a woman puts the receiver\n\ndown and walks out the door into the\n\nforeign afternoon feeling something\n\nneither language has words for, and for\n\nwhich no howl will suffice,\n\neither. . . ”?\n\nIn the latest collection of his essays\n\npublished here, Less Than One*,\n\nBrodsky ranges from nostalgia over\n\nLeningrad to the futility of passive\n\nresistance.\n\nHe offers warm and sensitive\n\ndescriptions of poets and writers who\n\nhave impressed him and from whose\n\nreadings he has been rewarded\n\nspiritually and technically; the works of\n\nAuden (’’the greatest mind of the 20th\n\ncentury”) Dostoevsky, Tblstoy and the\n\npoetess TSvestaeva.\n\n• Joseph Brodsky (right) soviet-born winner of the 1987 Nobel Literature prize, hugs his publisher Roger Strauss in London as he hears news of his Nobel prize. Help\n\n• Joseph Brodsky (right) soviet-born winner of the 1987 Nobel Literature prize,\n\nhugs his publisher Roger Strauss in London as he hears news of his Nobel prize.\n\nThere is the bitter reality of the loss\n\nof continuum in great Russian literature,\n\nthe legacy stripped by political realism.\n\nIn Catastrophes in the Air, Brodsky\n\ndescribes contemporary Russian writing\n\nas reduced to “tantalising hors d’oeuvres\n\non the empty table of a lean nation”, and\n\nbemoans the loss of the one writer he\n\nbelieved to have transcended “the vast,\n\ncorpse-strewn, treachery-ridden\n\nhistorical vista”, the untranslated,\n\nostracised Andrei Platonov.\n\nThese are essays of an intellect\n\nrefreshingly open and forthright, critical\n\nand caring.\n\nThey are essential reading for those in\n\nsearch of the lost art of the learned essay.\n\nPerhaps now that Brodsky has\n\nachieved the Nobel prize for literature\n\nhis works will become available in\n\nAustralia. It is a sorry state of affairs\n\nthat a poet of his grace and aptitude\n\nis unavailable to the reading public\n\nuntil the status of prize winner is\n\nachieved.\n\nHow many other gifted writers of non\n\nEnglish language prose, poetry and\n\nliterature must go unpublished and\n\ntherefore unread and unloved in his\n\ncountry?"
