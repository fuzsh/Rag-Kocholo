        "text": "Valentina Polukhina. Source: Alexander Korolkov / RGFrom Those Who Remember Me. Source: Tomsk State University\n\nRussian poet Joseph Brodsky would have turned 75 this year. To commemorate this, a Tomsk publisher has issued a book of poems From Those Who Remember Me. Brodsky once wrote ‘Those who forget me would make a city’, but this anthology proves there are many more that remember him.\n\n“Over the years I have collected several hundreds poems dedicated to Brodsky by poets from all over the world”, British-Russian scholar Valentina Polukhina, who was a friend of Brodsky, told RBTH. Three years ago, Polukhina decided to issue an anthology of these poems and selected 115 Russian and 55 foreign poets, asking some to compose verse especially for the commemorative book.\n\n\"When I approached British poets none refused since all of them either knew Brodsky personally or admired his work. I am proud to say that two of 18 British poets are the patrons of my charity - The Russian Poets Fund - the former Archbishop of Canterbury Baron Rowan Williams and a former Poet Laureate of UK - Sir Andrew Motion,” Polukhina says.\n\nBorn in England, American citizen Wystan Hugh Auden (1907-1973) was regarded by many critics as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. He was also a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on different subjects.\n\n“W. H. Auden met Brodsky in Vienna and brought him to London Poetry International Festival of which Daniel Weissbort was one of the organizers,” Polukhina said.\n\nPhoto: Joseph Brodsky. Source: Opale / East News\n\nW. H. Auden, Foreword to Joseph Brodsky “Selected Poems” (Penguin Books, 1973\n\nOne demands two things of a poem. Firstly, it must be a well-made verbal object that does honor to the language in which it is written. Secondly, it must say something significant about a reality common to us all, but perceived from a unique perspective. What the poet say has never been said before, but, once he has said it, his readers recognize its validity for themselves.\n\n…My chief reason for believing that Professor Kline’s translations do justice to their original is that they convince me that Joseph Brodsky is an excellent craftsman… Mr Brodsky commands many tones of voice, from the lyric (A Christmas Ballad) to the elegiac (Verses on the Death of T. S. Eliot) to the comic-grotesque (Two Hours in an Empty Tank), and can handle with ease a wide variety of rhythms and meters, short lines, long lines, iambics, anapaestic, masculine rhymes and feminine…\n\nAbout the uniqueness and, at the same time, universal relevance of a poet’s vision, it is easier for a foreigner to judge, since this does not primarily depend upon the language in which it is written.\n\nMr. Brodsky is not an easy poet, but even a cursory reading will reveal that, like Van Gogh and Virginia Woolf, he has an extraordinary capacity to envision material object as sacramental signs, messengers from the unseen…\n\nHe is a traditionalist in the sense that he is interested in what most poets in all ages have been interested in, that is, in personal encounters with nature, human artifacts, persons loved or revered, and in reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence.\n\nDaniel Weissbort (1935-2013) was a co-founder of the journal Modern Poetry in Translation. He published anthologies of Russian Poetry of XX Century, and with Valentina Polukhina - An Anthology of Contemporary Russian Women Poets (2005). His memoir of the late Joseph Brodsky is entitled From Russian with Love.\n\nJoseph Brodsky.

Well, there is no need to think of it,\n\nbecause you said it yourself.\n\nYour tenderly, with tenderness —\n\nI wince now, as I did then,\n\nThe word, resuscitated in our language,\n\nyours as much as mine.\n\nNothing to do with flower children,\n\nwith reimagined gender roles.\n\nTo do with language simply.\n\nYou were, found yourself,\n\namong us, were there to be found,\n\nwere found, belonging,\n\nmore so than the indigenous even…\n\nBecause you changed wherever it was you were.\n\nWe did not believe, couldn’t,\n\nyet accepted the fait-accompli.\n\nIts saving virtue that,\n\nour acceptance of the fait-accompli.\n\nAn accomplished fact, then, Joseph,\n\nand somehow we found ourselves in the middle\n\nof a conversation with you,\n\nas we were when suddenly\n\nyou were an absence in our lives.\n\n1996\n\nPeter Jay (born in 1945) was Assistant Director for the London Poetry International Festivals from 1969–73. He has edited several anthologies of poetry and\n\ntranslations.\n\nHe has also published Weissbort’s memoir From Russian\n\nwith Love.\n\nJoseph Brodsky in Washington D.C., October 1991.

My job as assistant director was mainly to keep the poets happy, help them in practical ways with transport etc., and make sure they knew where they should be and when. So I came to be keeping Joseph company before or after his reading, I forget which.\n\n“The opening describes hearing in the background over the PA system the voice of a poet reading onstage (it was Robert Lowell). I discovered that Joseph and I shared a birthday – he was five years older than me – and his passion for the English Metaphysical poets. So my poem becomes a double homage by using the stanza form of John Donne’s ‘The Flea’, which as it mentions he had translated. The Donne pun (‘done’), was John Donne’s own, but Andrew Marvell as far as I know did not use ‘marvelling’,” the author comments in the anthology.\n\nRowan Douglas Williams (born in 1950) is an Anglican bishop, theologian and poet. From 2002 until 2012 he was the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nOn 26 December 2012, 10 Downing Street announced Williams' elevation to the peerage as a Life Baron, so that he could continue to speak in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nDr. Williams speaks fluent Russian and has published several books on V. N. Lossky and F. M. Dostoevsky. As a poet he published three collections of poems.\n\nA monument near the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Source: PhotoXpress\n\nRowan Williams\n\nWaters of Babylon: i.m.

And the moist muscles swell and burst.\n\n2013\n\nGeorge Szirtes was born in Budapest in 1948 and came to England as a refugee at the age of eight.
