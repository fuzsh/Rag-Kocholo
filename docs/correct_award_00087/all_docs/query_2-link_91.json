        "text": "Joseph Brodsky was a Russian-American poet, essayist, and Nobel laureate. He is considered one of the most important poets of the late 20th century. His work continues to be studied and admired for its formal mastery, intellectual rigor, and unflinching exploration of exile, memory, and the human condition.\n\nBrodsky's poetry is characterized by its formal precision and erudition. He drew heavily on classical and European literary traditions, often employing traditional forms like sonnets and elegies. His language is both precise and evocative, capable of capturing both the grandeur of history and the intimacy of personal experience."
