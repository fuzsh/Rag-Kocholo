        "text": "November 28, 2018\n\nThis collection is witty and clever. There’s no discerning theme, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but given that there’s also no clear tone, it seems like a bit of a mish mash. There’s no doubt that Brodsky is a wordsmith, and that some of these poems were originally written by his adopted language - English - and others translated by him from Russian. Most poems try too hard to combine wittiness, cleverness, and sound craftsmanship, unfortunately at the expense of emotional resonance. I connected with only a handful of poems as a result. The rest were entertaining or uninteresting.\n\nOn a side note: if some of the lines that snuck through are any indication of his personality, then I’m afraid he might be among that great collection of misogynist writers.\n\nFebruary 12, 2017\n\n\"Great!\" cries the Emperor. \"What one conquers\n\nis up to the scholar's quills.\n\nAnd let the Treasury boys go bonkers\n\ntrying to pay the bills.\"\n\nMy reading of this late Brodsky collection was deeply influenced by yesterday's experience with the biography. Medical issues hover just off the page. Overpopulation and climate change abound. Seeking not only solace but perspective, Brodsky heralds objects at the expense of memory. The latter being but ubiquitous cigarette smoke.\n\nThe citation above highlights the eternal recurrence. My wife's brother alerted me this morning that he's found a parcel of goats for me to shepherd should we find ourselves compelled to relocate overseas.\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nBrodsky’s enervating style spoils his attempts to be playful and colloquial. Top tip: Fin de Siecle.\n\nFebruary 11, 2018\n\n\"… quando sussulti al pensiero della tua pochezza,\n\nricorda: lo spazio, al quale, sembra, niente è necessario,\n\nha un bisogno estremo, tuttavia,\n\ndi uno sguardo da fuori, di un criterio del vuoto.\n\nE solo tu puoi servire a questo scopo.\"\n\n(Insegnamento, p. 41)\n\nJuly 29, 2007\n\nI've heard he doesn't translate well, but I still love this collection.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nJoseph Brodsky’s So Forth is an anthology of Maps and narrative of guests at derision. The Noble Prize Winner releases yet another book of poems and it’s vernacular and garishness (albeit in respect to being a work containing fiery prose and diction it never fails to deliver on command- as though benefic portents were afoot- sink into this and other Brodsky collections, one must read the Nobel Prize Winners of history to become a learned person\n\nMay 7, 2018\n\nWonderful distractions, thoughtful, light, easy read.\n\nApril 1, 2022\n\nPoesia Russa para celebrar a cultura universal. Nascido em Leningrado, mas expulso da URSS.\n\nJune 20, 2015\n\nThe name Joseph Brodsky has always sounded so stodgy and professorial that I've avoided him for years. But finding this posthumous collection in an abandoned cardboard box in Chelsea, I thought I'd give his poems a chance. After all, what's in a name? Here, the longest poems (\"Vertumnus,\" especially) deliver the least; while those which rhyme in an almost childlike fashion (\"A Song,\"\"Reveille,\" \"Love Song,\" \"A Tale\") defy their simple titles and delight with playful complexity.\n\nBook found in box on 16th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues.\n\nDecember 18, 2007\n\nIn general I like Russian poetry. He's a Russian poet.\n\nJune 13, 2012\n\nDidn't get a whole lot out of this (Kind of meloncolie) but the guy who suggested it likes it. To each his own.\n\nJune 8, 2012\n\nThe poem Brodsky wrote for his daughter is, perhaps, one of the most beautiful things I've ever read, partially because of the context, but also, because this man could write his ass off."
