        "text": "Joseph Brodsky\n\nPoetry\n\nSeven Strophes\n\nI was but what you’d brush\n\nwith your palm, what your leaning\n\nbrow would hunch to in evening’s\n\nraven-black hush.\n\nI was but what your gaze\n\nin that dark could distinguish:\n\na dim shape to begin with,\n\nlater – features, a face.\n\nIt was you, on my right,\n\non my left, with your heated\n\nsighs, who molded my helix,\n\nwhispering at my side.\n\nIt was you by that black\n\nwindow’s trembling tulle pattern\n\nwho laid in my raw cavern\n\na voice calling you back.\n\nI was practically blind.\n\nYou, appearing, then hiding,\n\ngave me my sight and heightened\n\nit. Thus some leave behind\n\na trace. Thus they make worlds.\n\nThus, having done so, at random\n\nwastefully they abandon\n\ntheir work to its whirls.\n\nThus, prey to speeds\n\nof light, heat, cold, or darkness,\n\na sphere in space without markers\n\nspins and spins.\n\n“Seven Strophes” from COLLECTED POEMS IN ENGLISH\n\nby Joseph Brodsky.\n\nCopyright © 2000 by the Estate of Joseph Brodsky.\n\nUsed by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nCAUTION: Users are warned that this work is\n\nprotected under copyright laws and downloading is strictly prohibited.
