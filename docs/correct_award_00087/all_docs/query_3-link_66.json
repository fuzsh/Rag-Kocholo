        "text": "(1940–96). Russian-born American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky wrote intense and emotive poetry on themes such as displacement and loss. Brodsky, who wrote in both Russian and English, was widely recognized for his characteristic lyricism, irony, and wit. His poems and essays, which were translated into numerous languages, earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1987.\n\nJoseph Alexandrovich Brodsky (in Russian, Iosip Aleksandrovich Brodsky) was born on May 24, 1940, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia. Bored and frustrated with the Soviet educational system, he left school at the age of 15 and held a succession of menial jobs to support himself while he studied and wrote poetry. He learned Polish and English in order to translate the works of Polish poet Czesław Miłosz and English poet John Donne. Brodsky’s early poetry established his reputation among fellow writers in Leningrad but also attracted the attention of the Soviet authorities. In 1964 the Soviet government—which denounced Brodsky’s erratic work record and his poetry—deemed him a “social parasite” and sentenced him to five years of hard labor. In response to international protest and domestic pressure from prominent Soviet literary figures, the Soviet authorities commuted Brodsky’s sentence in 1965. Western countries began publishing translations of his work shortly thereafter.\n\nThe government’s hostility toward Brodsky continued, and in 1972 he was forcibly exiled from the Soviet Union. After a brief stay in Vienna, Austria, with English author W.H. Auden, he settled in the United States and became a naturalized citizen in 1977. In the United States Brodsky spent intermittent periods from 1972 to 1980 as a poet-in-residence at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a visiting professor at several other schools, including Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts from 1981 to 1996, where he taught Russian language and literature. When not teaching he traveled extensively. In addition to winning the 1987 Nobel Prize for Literature, Brodsky received the honor of serving as the first foreign-born poet laureate of the United States, in 1991–92."
