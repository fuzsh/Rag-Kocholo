        "text": "New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1988. Uncorrected proof. Original publisher's wrappers. Good. Item #202\n\nOctavo (13.5 x 21 cm). 168 pages. Text in English. Foxing to spine and edges; internally very good.\n\nContains poems translated from the Russian and composed in English.\n\nIosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky was a Russian-American poet and essayist. Born in Leningrad in 1940, Brodsky ran afoul of Soviet authorities and was expelled (\"strongly advised\" to emigrate) from the Soviet Union in 1972, settling in the United States with the help of W. H. Auden and other supporters. He taught thereafter at Mount Holyoke College, and at universities including Yale, Columbia, Cambridge, and Michigan. Brodsky was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity\". He was appointed United States Poet Laureate in 1991."
