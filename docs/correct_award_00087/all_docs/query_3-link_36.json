        "text": "In an eloquent tribute to Joseph Brodsky, published almost exactly a month after his premature and widely lamented death, Tatyana Tolstaya, in The New York Review of Books, quotes some lines from the poet’s early work:\n\nIn the dark I won’t find your deep blue façade\n\nI’ll fall on the asphalt between the crossed lines\n\nShe goes on to conjecture: “I think that the reason he didn’t want to return to Russia even for a day was so that this incautious prophecy would not come to be. A student of—among others—Akhmatova and Tsvetaeva (he knew their poetic superstitiousness), he knew the conversation they had during their one and only meeting. ‘How could you write that. . . . Don’t you know that a poet’s words always come true?’ one of them reproached. ‘And how could you write that . . . ?’ the other was amazed. And what they foretold did indeed come to pass.”\n\nWithout any desire to sound mystical, I do think something prophetic can be claimed for Brodsky’s poetry, or at least for two details, one of them small, the other large and visionary. The first is from a poem actually titled “A Prophecy,” addressed to an unnamed beloved, and containing these lines:\n\n—And if\n\nwe make a child, we’ll call the boy Andrei,\n\nAnna the girl, so that our Russian speech,\n\nimprinted on its wrinkled little face,\n\nshall never be forgot.\n\nJoseph (as everyone who ever knew him was allowed affectionately to call him) was the father of two children, a boy born in Russia, still there, from whom he was separated by involuntary exile, and a daughter, born in America to his Russian-Italian wife, Maria. The children are named Andrei and Anna.\n\nThe larger, more spacious and important prophecy is embodied in a major poem, “The Hawk’s Cry in Autumn” (printed here in full), of which Tolstaya remarks in the same tribute: “He has a poem about a hawk . . . in the hills of Massachusetts who flies so high that the rush of rising air won’t let him descend back to earth, and the hawk perishes there, at those heights where there are neither birds nor people, nor any air to breathe.”\n\nTo this brief comment I would like to add some of my own. The wind with which the poem begins is the wind of the spirit (John 3:8) as well as of inspiration, the necessary (and destructive) element in which the poet tries to dwell. The bird, at the pinnacle of his flight, guesses the truth of it: it’s the end. The Erínyes (Furies) themselves are invoked, as though the\n\naspiration to great heights must necessarily entail retributive punishment, as exemplified in Greek tragedy. And, echoing another ancient tradition, the agony and sacrifice of the bird/poet precipitates a thing of beauty, the first snowflakes of winter, the poems of a soul that has sustained the punishing climate of Archangelic Russia. The brilliance that delights earthbound children has been purchased at the price of unendurable suffering and death. Whether Brodsky’s wind owes anything to Percy Bysshe Shelley’s annihilating “West wind,” whether the Russian poet’s hawk is any kin to Gerard Manley Hopkins’s falcon, Thomas Hardy’s darkling thrush or his blinded bird, each reader must determine for himself. And can it be that this assertion of Rainer Maria Rilke’s played some part in Brodsky’s thought?: “Whoever does not consecrate himself wholly to art with all his wishes and values can never reach the highest goal.”\n\nIn his collection of essays, Less Than One, Brodsky has written so movingly about his early life that I will present here only the most meager biographical details. He was born Iosif Alexandrovich Brodsky on May 24, 1940, in Leningrad, the only child of adoring and adored parents so straitened of circumstances that the boy quit school after ninth grade to help support the family. He held more than a dozen jobs, including milling-machine operator, helper in a morgue (he once thought he might wish to become a doctor), photographer (his father’s work at one time), and participant in geological expeditions. Despite his limited formal schooling, his love of poetry led him to learn Polish, English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French, as well as Latin, in a determination to acquaint himself with all the world’s great poetry. He began writing his own poems in his teens, and earned money by translating Serbo-Croatian and Spanish poetry into Russian. He also translated the poems of John Donne and other Metaphysical poets, and two plays, The Quare Fellow and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. In 1964 he was forced into a “psychiatric hospital” and then arraigned at a show trial, charged with “parasitism” and with writing “anti-Soviet poetry that would corrupt the young.” What this actually meant was absolute state disapproval of a poetic credo Brodsky expressed in his Nobel Lecture: “A work of art, of literature especially, and a poem in particular, addresses a man tête-à-tête, entering with him into direct—free of any go-betweens—relations.” What Brodsky means, of course, is not only the necessary absence of censors but also the need for a literature disburdened of ulterior (which is to say, political) motives. He was sentenced to five years of degrading hard labor, but after the sentence provoked unambiguously condemnatory outcries from all over the world as well as within Soviet intellectual circles, it was “commuted” to exile. He left behind everything he loved: parents, language, son, home, and, with the help of W. H. Auden and the Academy of American Poets, made his way to his first teaching job in America, at the University of Michigan, under the watchful care of Carl and Ellendea Proffer.\n\nThe condition of exile is rarely easy, but Brodsky, fortified by a temperament both cheerful and mordantly sardonic, taking now as his domain the global landscape, the cold galactic emptinesses, the whole range of human history, set about his poetic task with fierce and undiscourageable industry. In the course of only a few years, he acquired an international audience of admiring readers, among them the members of the Swedish Academy. This recognition was accompanied by a blissful marriage to a beautiful woman, half-Russian, half-Italian, and the birth of a daughter, named Anna, probably in homage to Brodsky’s “discoverer” and poetic heroine, Akhmatova, and in fulfillment of a pledge. But these blessings were of the briefest duration, cut short by his death at the age of 55.\n\nHis poems are not easy; nor are they difficult in the familiar manner of, say, John Donne or William Empson. In their original Russian, they observe demanding formal patterns combined at times with an informality of diction that can be witty and irreverent, and are usually filled with unexpected, almost balletic leaps of the imagination. The Russian also evokes a playfulness that no English version can quite as gracefully convey. So richly furnished are the rueful and the comedic aspects of his work, his irony and bravado, that a willing reader will find enormous delights, enviable gifts, large spans of imaginative life that have not been lost in translation. In the time allotted to him, cut short by addictive smoking that endangered a heart already badly damaged by penal servitude (and for which he had undergone two bypass operations and was scheduled for a third), he managed somehow to acquaint himself as an intimate with the greatest poets of all periods, to feel at home (if, as an exile, nowhere else) at least in their demanding company, and able to sustain companionship with their best work in what must be thought of as a widely comprehensive multilingual anthology that he was apt to have almost exactly by heart.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nLetter to an Archaeologist\n\nCitizen, enemy, mama’s boy, sucker, utter\n\ngarbage, panhandler, swine, refujew, verrucht;\n\na scalp so often scalded with boiling water\n\nthat the puny brain feels completely cooked.\n\nYes, we have dwelt here: in this concrete, brick, wooden\n\nrubble which you now arrive to sift.\n\nAll our wires were crossed, barbed, tangled, or interwoven.\n\nAlso: we didn’t love our women, but they conceived.\n\nSharp is the sound of the pickax that hurts dead iron;\n\nstill, it’s gentler than what we’ve been told or have said ourselves.\n\nStranger! move carefully through our carrion:\n\nwhat seems carrion to you is freedom to our cells.\n\nLeave our names alone. Don’t reconstruct those vowels,\n\nconsonants, and so forth: they won’t resemble larks\n\nbut a demented bloodhound whose maw devours\n\nits own traces, feces, and barks, and barks.\n\nOn Love\n\nTwice I woke up tonight and wandered to\n\nthe window. And the lights down on the street,\n\nlike pale omission points, tried to complete\n\nthe fragment of a sentence spoken through\n\nsleep, but diminished into darkness, too.\n\nI’d dreamt that you were pregnant, and in spite\n\nof having lived so many years apart\n\nI still felt guilty and my heartened palm\n\ncaressed your belly as, by the bedside,\n\nit fumbled for my trousers and the light-\n\nswitch on the wall. And with the bulb turned on\n\nI knew that I was leaving you alone\n\nthere, in the darkness, in the dream, where calmly\n\nyou waited till I might return,\n\nnot trying to reproach or scold me\n\nfor the unnatural hiatus. For\n\ndarkness restores what light cannot repair.\n\nThere we are married, blest, we make once more\n\nthe two-backed beast and children are the fair\n\nexcuse of what we’re naked for.\n\nSome future night you will appear again.\n\nYou’ll come to me, worn out and thin now, after\n\nthings in between, and I’ll see son or daughter\n\nnot named as yet. This time I will restrain\n\nmy hand from groping for the switch, afraid\n\nand feeling that I have no right\n\nto leave you both like shadows by that sever-\n\ning fence of days that bar your sight,\n\nvoiceless, negated by the real light\n\nthat keeps me unattainable forever.\n\nOdysseus to Telemachus\n\nMy dear Telemachus,\n\nThe Trojan War\n\nis over now; I don’t recall who won it.\n\nThe Greeks, no doubt, for only they would leave\n\nso many dead so far from their own homeland.\n\nBut still, my homeward way has proved too long.\n\nWhile we were wasting time there, old Poseidon,\n\nit almost seems, stretched and extended space.\n\nI don’t know where I am or what this place\n\ncan be. It would appear some filthy island,\n\nwith bushes, buildings, and great grunting pigs.\n\nA garden choked with weeds; some queen or other.\n\nGrass and huge stones . . . Telemachus, my son!\n\nTo a wanderer the faces of all islands\n\nresemble one another. And the mind\n\ntrips, numbering waves; eyes, sore from sea horizons,\n\nrun; and the flesh of water stuffs the ears.\n\nI can’t remember how the war came out;\n\neven how old you are—I can’t remember.\n\nGrow up, then, my Telemachus, grow strong.\n\nOnly the gods know if we’ll see each other\n\nagain. You’ve long since ceased to be that babe\n\nbefore whom I reined in the plowing bullocks.\n\nHad it not been for Palamedes’ trick\n\nwe two would still be living in one household.\n\nBut maybe he was right; away from me\n\nyou are quite safe from all Oedipal passions,\n\nand your dreams, my Telemachus, are blameless.\n\nThe Hawk’s Cry in Autumn\n\nWind from the northwestern quarter is lifting him high above\n\nthe dove-gray, crimson, umber, brown\n\nConnecticut Valley. Far beneath,\n\nchickens daintily pause and move\n\nunseen in the yard of the tumbledown\n\nfarmstead; chipmunks blend with the heath.\n\nNow adrift on the airflow, unfurled, alone,\n\nall that he glimpses—the hills’ lofty, ragged\n\nridges, the silver stream that threads\n\nquivering like a living bone\n\nof steel, badly notched with rapids,\n\nthe townships like strings of beads\n\nstrewn across New England. Having slid down to nil\n\nthermometers—those household gods in niches—\n\nfreeze, inhibiting thus the fire\n\nof leaves and churches’ spires. Still,\n\nno churches for him. In the windy reaches,\n\nundreamt of by the most righteous choir,\n\nhe soars in a cobalt-blue ocean, his beak clamped shut,\n\nhis talons clutched tight into his belly\n\n—claws balled up like a sunken fist—\n\nsensing in each wisp of down the thrust\n\nfrom below, glinting back the berry\n\nof his eyeball, heading south-southeast\n\nto the Rio Grande, the Delta, the beech groves and farther still:\n\nto a nest hidden in the mighty groundswell\n\nof grass whose edges no fingers trust,\n\nsunk amid forest’s odors, filled\n\nwith splinters of red-speckled eggshell,\n\nwith a brother or a sister’s ghost.\n\nThe heart overgrown with flesh, down, feather, wing,\n\npulsing at feverish rate, nonstopping,\n\npropelled by internal heat and sense,\n\nthe bird goes slashing and scissoring\n\nthe autumnal blue, yet by the same swift token,\n\nenlarging it at the expense\n\nof its brownish speck, barely registering on the eye,\n\na dot, sliding far above the lofty\n\npine tree; at the expense of the empty look\n\nof that child, arching up at the sky,\n\nthat couple that left the car and lifted\n\ntheir heads, that woman on the stoop.\n\nBut the uprush of air is still lifting him\n\nhigher and higher. His belly feathers\n\nfeel the nibbling cold. Casting a downward gaze,\n\nhe sees the horizon growing dim,\n\nhe sees, as it were, the features\n\nof the first thirteen colonies whose\n\nchimneys all puff out smoke. Yet it’s their total within his sight\n\nthat tells the bird of his elevation,\n\nof what altitude he’s reached this trip.\n\nWhat am I doing at such a height?\n\nHe senses a mixture of trepidation\n\nand pride. Heeling over a tip\n\nof wing, he plummets down. But the resilient air\n\nbounces him back, winging up to glory,\n\nto the colorless icy plane.\n\nHis yellow pupil darts a sudden glare\n\nof rage, that is, a mix of fury\n\nand terror. So once again\n\nhe turns and plunges down. But as walls return\n\nrubber balls, as sins send a sinner to faith, or near,\n\nhe’s driven upward this time as well!\n\nHe! whose innards are still so warm!\n\nStill higher! Into some blasted ionosphere!\n\nThat astronomically objective hell\n\nof birds that lacks oxygen, and where the milling stars\n\nplay millet served from a plate or a crescent.\n\nWhat, for the bipeds, has always meant\n\nheight, for the feathered is the reverse.\n\nNot with his puny brain but with shriveled air sacs\n\nhe guesses the truth of it: it’s the end.\n\nAnd at this point he screams. From the hooklike beak\n\nthere tears free of him and flies ad luminem\n\nthe sound Erínyes make to rend\n\nsouls: a mechanical, intolerable shriek,\n\nthe shriek of steel that devours aluminum;\n\n“mechanical,” for it’s meant\n\nfor nobody, for no living ears:\n\nnot man’s, not yelping foxes’,\n\nnot squirrels’ hurrying to the ground\n\nfrom branches; not for tiny field mice whose tears\n\ncan’t be avenged this way, which forces\n\nthem into their burrows. And only hounds\n\nlift up their muzzles. A piercing, high-pitched squeal,\n\nmore nightmarish than the D-sharp grinding\n\nof the diamond cutting glass,\n\nslashes the whole sky across. And the world seems to reel\n\nfor an instant, shuddering from this rending.\n\nFor the warmth burns space in the highest as\n\nbadly as some iron fence down here\n\nbrands incautious gloveless fingers.\n\nWe, standing where we are, exclaim\n\n“There!” and see far above the tear\n\nthat is a hawk, and hear the sound that lingers\n\nin wavelets, a spider skein\n\nswelling notes in ripples across the blue vault of space\n\nwhose lack of echo spells, especially in October,\n\nan apotheosis of pure sound.\n\nAnd caught in this heavenly patterned lace,\n\nstarlike, spangled with hoarfrost powder,\n\nsilver-clad, crystal-bound,\n\nthe bird sails to the zenith, to the dark-blue high\n\nof azure. Through binoculars we foretoken\n\nhim, a glittering dot, a pearl.\n\nWe hear something ring out in the sky,\n\nlike some family crockery being broken,\n\nslowly falling aswirl,\n\nyet its shards, as they reach our palms, don’t hurt\n\nbut melt when handled. And in a twinkling,\n\nonce more one makes out curls, eyelets, strings,\n\nrainbowlike, multicolored, blurred\n\ncommas, ellipses, spirals, linking\n\nheads of barley, concentric rings—\n\nthe bright doodling pattern the feather once possessed,\n\na map, now a mere heap of flying\n\npale flakes that make a green slope appear\n\nwhite. And the children, laughing and brightly dressed,\n\nswarm out of doors to catch them, crying\n\nwith a loud shout in English, “Winter’s here!”\n\nAbout the Author\n\nANTHONY HECHT (1923-2004) was a poet, critic, and university professor.
