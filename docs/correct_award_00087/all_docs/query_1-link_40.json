        "text": "September 8, 2019\n\nPOSTSCRIPTUM\n\nHow sad that my life has not come to mean\n\nfor you what your life came to mean for me.\n\n. . . How many times in vacant lots have I\n\nconsigned my copper coin, crowned with the seal\n\nof state, to that webbed universe of wires,\n\nattempting hopelessly to stretch the time\n\nof our connectedness . . . Alas, unless\n\na man can manage to eclipse the world,\n\nhe's left to twirl a gap-toothed dial in some\n\nphone booth, as one might spin a ouija board,\n\nuntil a phantom answers, echoing\n\nthe last wails of a buzzer in the night.\n\nA PROPHECY\n\nWe'll go and live together by the shore;\n\nhuge dams will wall us from the continent.\n\nA home-made lamp will hurl its warming glow\n\nacross the roundness of our centered space.\n\nWe shall wage war at cards, and cock an ear\n\nto catch the crashing of the maddening surf.\n\nWe'll gently cough, or sigh a soundless sigh,\n\nwhenever the wind roars too raucously.\n\nI shall be old, and you will still be young.\n\nBut, as the youngsters say, we'll count the time\n\nthat's left us till the new age breaks in days,\n\nnot years. In our reversed, small Netherland\n\nwe'll plant a kitchen-garden, you and I;\n\nand will shall sizzle oysters by the door,\n\nand drink the rays of the sun's octopus,\n\nLet summer rains crash on our cucumbers;\n\nwe'll get as tanned as any Eskimo,\n\nand you will run your fingers tenderly\n\nalong the virgin V where I'm unburned.\n\nI'll see my collarbone in the clear glass,\n\nand glimpse a mirrored wave behind my back,\n\nand my old geiger counter, cased in tin,\n\nthat dangles from its faded, sweat-soaked strap.\n\nWhen winter comes, unpitying, it will\n\ntwist off the thatch from our wood roof. And if\n\nwe make a child, we'll call the boy Andrei,\n\nAnna the girl, so that our Russian speech,\n\nimprinted on its little wrinkled face\n\nshall never be forgot. Our alphabet's\n\nfirst sound is but the lengthening of a sigh\n\nand thus may be affirmed for future time.\n\nWe shall wage war at cards until the tide's\n\nretreating sinuosities draw us,\n\nwith all our trumps, down and away . . .\n\nOur child will gaze in silence at a moth,\n\nnot fathoming its urgent moth-motives\n\nfor beating at our lamp. But then the time\n\nwill come when he must make his way back through\n\nthe dam that walls us from the continent.\n\nSEPTEMBER THE FIRST\n\nThe day was called, simply, 'September First'.\n\nThe fall had come; the children were at school.\n\nAt Poland's border, Germans raised striped bars.\n\nTheir roaring tanks, like fingernails that smooth\n\nthe tinfoil on a piece of chocolate,\n\nflattened the uhlan lancers.\n\nSet out glasses!\n\nWe'll drink a toast to those uhlans who stood\n\nin first place on the roster of the dead,\n\nas on a classroom roster.\n\nOnce again\n\nthe birches rustle in the wind; dead leaves\n\nsift down on the low roofs of houses where\n\nno children's voices sound, as though on fallen\n\nPolish caps. The rumbling clouds crawl past,\n\navoiding the dead eyes of sunset windows.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017\n\nThe devil walks among us hour by hour\n\nand waits, each moment, for this fatal phrase.\n\nA combination of beautiful images and lovely writing along with greek mythology (in some of them) At first I wasn't that impressed but now I can say that i enjoyed most of his poems.\n\n{ Nature Morte hands down the most powerful and bitter poem out of the collection and the best one for me. Actually it's one of the best poems I have ever read. }\n\nThe one line that hit me the most, for personal reasons(duh) was this one\n\nIch liebe life, but chaos I adore\n\nAugust 3, 2018\n\nIntelektualaus žanro poezija apie Lietuvą, Rusijos inteligento pastebėtus kasdienybės epizodus ar buvimo mieste būsenos fiksavimas. Knygoje paskelbta Nobelio premijos įteikimo proga pasakyta kalba, Lietuvos literatūros kritikų prisiminimai apie poeto Brodskio viešnagę Lietuvoje, įtaką pasaulio kultūrai.\n\nJuly 30, 2011\n\nI saw Joseph Brodsky read once. In my memory, it was in 1973, shortly after he was exiled from Russia and well before he won the Nobel. I remember him as wearing a dark jacket, no tie, and having the serious face that some of the photos show, with a jaw that was set tight except when he was reading his poetry--and then he became animated, with a hand sometimes in the air. The poem I remember most included some German; likely, it was \"Two Hours in an Empty Tank.\" He read with a passion; we tend to think of our poets as professors, somewhat detached and engaged in often obscure wordplay. Brodsky was passionately of this world; he didn't read poetry, he declaimed it. He didn't flee from either the literary heritage or his own as the child of the war between the Soviets and Germans; he embraced both. Above all, his poetry is visually acute and ironic, passionately engaged with the world.\n\nAugust 23, 2015\n\nLoved his poetry, I need to read more of it! Straight to the top of my list of favorite russian poets.\n\n\" For though our life may be a thing to share,\n\nwho is there in this world to share our death?\n\nMan's garment gapes with holes.\n\nIt can be torn, by him who will, at this edge or at that.\n\nIt falls to shreds and is made whole again.\n\nOnce more it's rent.\n\nAnd only the far sky, in darkness,\n\nbrings the healing needle home.\"\n\n----\n\n\" Great faiths leave behind only holy relics:\n\nJudge then of the vast power of love,\n\nif objects touched by you I now hold,\n\nwhile you live, as holy.\"\n\n----\n\n\" Silence: a wave that cloaks eternity.\n\nSilence: the future fate of all our loving. \"\n\n\" Life is but talk hurled in the face of silence.\"\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nUsually, I'm reluctant to read poetry in translation because I don't know what will be lost in the process. Now I don't know if anything important is lost here as well, but I feel like that Brodsky is the perfect poet to read in English, maybe because of how obviously he is influenced by English poetry and how he mostly alludes to the Bible and Greek mythology and other cultural influences that are familiar to someone who mainly reads in English.\n\nBrodsky is a great poet. His poems are deceptively simple and straightforward without bizarre metaphors and many general proclamations but at their heart they are deeply sorrowful and contain subtle and very complex emotions that are deeply impactful to the reader. His poetry reminds one of a calm stoic person with a depth of suffering in a long tragic life, whose conversation ends up much too intense despite the appearance of the calm.\n\nI also expected Brodsky's poetry to be much more political than it is, considering that he faced prison for it. He does allude to his time in prison in multiple poems, but he's never overtly political. His poetry seem to be one of the most universal and timeless oeuvre I have seen and I guess it's because of how deeply entrenched in the classical western tradition it is.\n\nApril 20, 2021\n\n“Here on the hills, under empty skies,\n\namong roads which end in forests,\n\nlife steps back from itself\n\nand stares astonished at its own\n\nhissing and roaring forms.\n\nRoots cling, wheezing, to your boots,\n\nand no light show in the whole village.\n\nHere I wander in a no-man’s land\n\nand take a lcase on non-existence.\n\nWind tears the warmth out of my hands.\n\nA tree-hollow douses me with water;\n\nmud twists the ribbon of the footpath.”\n\n“Now that I’ve walled myself off from the world,\n\nI’d like to wall myself off from myself.\n\nNot fences of hewn poles, but mirror glass,\n\nit seems to me, will best accomplish this.\n\nI’ll study the dark features of my face:\n\nmy bristly beard, the blotches on my chin.\n\nPerhaps there is no better kind of wall\n\nthan a three-faced mirror for this parted pair.\n\nThis mirror shows, in twilight from the door,\n\nhuge starlings at the edge of the ploughland,\n\nand lakes lakes like breaches in the wall, yet crowned with fir-free teeth.\n\nBehold, the world beyond\n\ncreeps through these lakes—these breaches in our world—indeed, through every piddle opening.\n\nOr else this world crawls through them to the sky.”\n\nAugust 4, 2021\n\n'How sad that my life has not come to mean/ for you what your life came to mean for me' 71\n\nBrodsky is at times my favourite poet....\n\nHis poems can offer deep mediations on universal truths and unique perspectives on life, death and the process of decay. Dust in particular makes numerous appearances in this collection of poems.\n\nAt his best, his short poems contain and compress multiple images and kaleidoscopically expand meanings and significance. At his worst, in some of his longer poems, they verge on personal attacks and trite insight into power and politics.\n\nThere are too many favourites to mention, but below are some lines that, in particular, stood out and stand testament to his thoughtfulness as to moments where he projects a sense of deep, calm, contemplation as to time, silence and memory.\n\n'But tell me, soul, what was the look of life,/ how did it stand up to your soaring glance?' 32\n\n'for here I live, and somewhere there you cry' 32\n\n'It's fine that in this world there is no one/ who feels obliged to love you to distraction.'33\n\n'his dose of life proved fatal' 35\n\n'The dead lie calmly in their graves and dream. the living, in the oceans of their gowns' 40\n\n'All things are distant.What is near is dim' 43\n\n'...you did glimpse the seas,/ and distant lands, and Hell-first in your dreams,/ then waking. You did see a jewelled Heaven/ set in the wretched frame of men's low lusts./And you saw life' 43\n\n'May this tiny fragment/of the life we then shared/beat in your heart wildly/ like a fish not yet dead.' 53\n\n'the night moves on inverted wings, aloft,/ above dense bushes that now hang upside-down-/insistent, like the memory of the past,/ a silent past that seems somehow to live on' 54\n\n'What does it matter that a shadow of mindlessness/has crossed my eyes, that the damp/ has soaked my beard, that my cap, askew,/-a crown for this twilight-is reflected/like some boundary beyond which/my soul cannot penetrate?/ I do not try to get beyond my visor,/buttons, collar, boots, or cuffs./ But my hear pounds suddenly when I discover/ that somewhere I am torn. The cold/ crashes into my chest, jolting my heart' 58\n\n'But one day we must all go back. Back home,/ Back to our native hearth. And my own path/ lies through the city's heart. God grant that I/ shall not have with me then a two edges sword-/since cities start, for those who dwell in them,/ with central squares and towers-/ but for the wanderer/ approaching-/ with their outskirts' 64\n\n'But a talented fragment/ can pretend to be whole' 68\n\n'No man stands as a stranger./ But the threshold of shame/ is defined by our feelings/ at the 'Never again' 68\n\n'In their transit through time/ evenings speedily voyage/ far above starling-homes,/far beyond black tillage' 82\n\n'In recent years whatever stand alone/ stands as a symbol of another time./His is a claim for space.' 89\n\n'For no loneliness is deeper than the memory of miracles' 92\n\n'a sound that's less than music, though it's more/ than noise' 93\n\n'though there's no end to our discontent,/ there's an end to our winters' 94\n\n'It's not that you're particularly fair/ but rather that you're unrepeatable' 96\n\n'I dreamed the dense dark and the glow of the waves' 110\n\n'he marched across the margin of his life,/ made absolute the concept of dismissal,/ and disappeared, leaving no trace behind.' 128\n\n'Forever is not a word but a number' 139\n\n'And nothing can be more impenetrable/ than veils of words that have devoured their things;/ nothing is more tormenting than men's language' 146\n\n'life is but talked hurled in the face of silence' 147\n\n'Silence: a wave that cloaks eternity./ Silence: the future fate of all our loving' 147\n\nJune 20, 2017\n\n...\n\nIX\n\nPollux, dear friend. All merges to a stain.\n\nNo groan shall be wrenched from my lips.\n\nHere I stand, my coat thrown open,\n\nletting the world flow into my eyes\n\nthrough a sieve of incomprohension.\n\nI'm nearly deaf, o God. I'm nearly blind.\n\nI hear no words, and the moon burns steadily\n\nat no more than twenty watts. I will not set\n\nmy course across the sky between the stars\n\nand raindrops. The woods will echo\n\nnot my songs, but only my coughs...\n\n(New Stanzas to Augusta, 1964)\n\nRead\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nBrodsky called vegans the lettuce gang. Yeah, there's that. I read some other edition with actually decent translations of Nativity poems, but not my cuppa.\n\nRead\n\nJune 23, 2018\n\n\"Filosofiją studijuoti geriausiu atveju dera sulaukus pusšimčio metų. Planuoti visuomenės modelį - juo labiau. Iš pradžių išmokim virti sriubą, kepti - tegu ir ne meškerioti - žuvis, gaminti padorią kavą. Jeigu to nepramokai, dorovės dėsniai atsiduoda tėvo diržu arba vertimu iš vokiškos knygos\".\n\nRead\n\nMarch 21, 2020\n\nYou’re coming home again. What does that mean?\n\nCan there be anyone here who still needs you,\n\nWho would still want you to count you as his friend?\n\nYou’re home, you’ve bought sweet wine to drink with supper,\n\nAnd, staring out the window, bit by bit\n\nYou come to see that you’re the one who’s guilty:\n\nThe only one. That’s fine. Thank god for that. Or maybe one should say, “ thanks for small favors.”\n\nIt’s fine that there’s no one else to blame,\n\nIt’s fine that you’re free of all connections,\n\nIt’s fine that in this world there’s no one\n\nWho feels obligated to love you to distraction.\n\nIt’s fine that no one ever took your arm\n\nAnd saw you to the door on a dark evening,\n\nIt’s fine to walk, alone, in this vast world\n\nToward home from the tumultuous railroad station.\n\nIt’s fine to catch yourself, while rushing home,\n\nMouthing a phrase that’s something else than candid;\n\nYou’re suddenly aware that your own soul\n\nIs very slow to take in what has happened.\n\n-\n\nThe fire, as you can hear, is dying down.\n\nThe shadows in the corners have been shifting.\n\nIt’s now too late to shake a fist at them\n\nOr yell at them to stop what they are doing.\n\nThis legion doesn’t listen to commands.\n\nIt now has closed its ranks and forms a circle.\n\nIn silence it advances from the walls,\n\nAnd I am suddenly at its dead center.\n\nThe bursts of darkness, like black questions marks,\n\nAre mounting higher steadily and higher.\n\nThe dark drifts down more densely from above.\n\nEngulfs my chin, and crumples my white paper.\n\nThe clock hands have completely disappeared.\n\nOne can’t see them, and one can’t hear them.\n\nThere’s nothing left but bright spots in one’s eyes-\n\nIn eyes that now seem frozen and unmoving,\n\nThe fire has died. As you can hear, it’s dead.\n\nThe bitter smokes swirls, clinging to the ceiling.\n\nBut this bright spot is stamped upon one’s eyes.\n\nOr rather it’s stamped upon the darkness.\n\n—\n\nNow that I’ve walled myself off from the world,\n\nI’d like to wall myself off from myself.\n\nNot fences of hewn poles, but mirror glass,\n\nIt seems to me, will best accomplish this.\n\nI’ll study the dark features of my face:\n\nMy bristly beard, the blotches on my chin.\n\nPerhaps there’s no better kind of wall\n\nThan a three-faced mirror for the parted pair.\n\nThis mirror shows, in twilight from the door,\n\nHuge starlings at the edge of the ploughland,\n\nAnd lakes like breaches in the wall, yet crowned with fire-tree teeth.\n\nBehold, the world beyond\n\nCreeps through these lakes- these breaches in our world-\n\nIndeed , through every puddle opening.\n\nOr else this world crawls through them to the sky.\n\n——\n\nAnd silence is the future of all days\n\nThat roll toward speech; yes, silence is the presence\n\nOf farewell in our greeting as we touch.\n\nIndeed, the future of our words is silence-\n\nThose words which have devoured the staff of things\n\nWith hungry vowels, for things abhor sharp corners.\n\nSilence: a wave that cloaks eternity.\n\nSilence: the future fate of all our loving-\n\nA space, not a dead barrier, but space\n\nThat robs the false voice in the blood-stream throbbing\n\nOf every echoed answer to its love.\n\nAnd silence is the present of fate of those who\n\nHave lived before us; it’s a matchmaker\n\nThat manages to bring all men together\n\nInto the speaking presence of today.\n\nLife is but talk hurled in the face of silence.’\n\n‘A squabbling of all motions, of all life.’\n\n‘Gloom speaks to gloom and marks a hazy ending.’\n\n‘ And walls are but protests embodied here,\n\nThe very incarnation of objections.’\n\n—-\n\nPeople and things crowd in.\n\nEyes can be bruised and hurt\n\nBy people as well as things.\n\nBetter to live in the dark.\n\nI sit on a wooden bench\n\nWatching the passers-by-\n\nSometimes whole families\n\nI am fed up with the light.\n\nThis is a winter month.\n\nFirst on the calendar.\n\nI shall begin to speak\n\nWhen I’m fed up with the dark.\n\nIt’s time. I shall now begin.\n\nIt makes no difference with what.\n\nOpen mouth. It’s better to speak,\n\nAlthough i can also be mute.\n\nWhat then shall i talk about?\n\nShall i talk about nothingness?\n\nShall i talk about days, or nights?\n\nOr people? No, only things,\n\nSince people will surely die.\n\nAll of them. As i shall.\n\nAll take is a barren trade.\n\nA writing in the wind’s wall.\n\nMy blood is very cold-\n\nIts cold is more withering\n\nThan iced-to-the-bottom streams\n\nPeople aren’t my thing\n\nDust. When you switch lights on,\n\nThere’s nothing but dust to see.\n\nThat’s true even if the thing\n\nIs sealed up hermetically.\n\nOctober 29, 2020\n\nThoughtful words. Poetry loses something in translation; nevertheless I enjoyed these poems.\n\nMarch 23, 2016\n\nпробовал читать, половину прожевал, не моё, хотя красиво\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nLovely. I have read Brodsky's essays, this is the first time I read the poems. Lovely and surprising images."
