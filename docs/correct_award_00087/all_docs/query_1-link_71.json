Born in Leningrad in 1940, he was persecuted by Soviet authorities for his poetry and Jewish heritage. He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972 and settled in the United States with the help of supporters like W.H. Auden. Brodsky taught at prestigious universities and was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was known for his clarity of thought and poetic intensity in works addressing his experiences in the Soviet Union and later life in America.",
