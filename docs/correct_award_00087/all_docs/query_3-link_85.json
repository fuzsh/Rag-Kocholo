        "text": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2002.\n\nNew Book.\n\nItem #17675\n\nISBN: 9780374528386\n\nPaperback. 560 pp.\n\nThe poems of the legendary Nobel Laureate, in one volume at last.\n\nOne of the greatest and grandest advocates of the literary vocation, Joseph Brodsky truly lived his life as a poet, and for it earned eighteen months in an Arctic labor camp, expulsion from his native country, and the Nobel Prize in Literature. Such were one man's wages. Here, collected for the first time, are all the poems he published in English, from his earliest collaborations with Derek Walcott, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss, and Anthony Hecht to the moving farewell poems he wrote near the end of his life. With nearly two hundred poems, several of them never before published in book form, this will be the essential volume of Brodsky's work.\n\nPrice: $22.00\n\nSee all items in Poetry\n\nSee all items by Joseph Brodsky"
