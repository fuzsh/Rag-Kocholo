Ruben Studdard’s marriage has been on shaky grounds for a while.

The second season American Idol winner, 33, and his wife of three years, Surata Zuri McCants, have called it quits, according to reports.

The two met back in October 2006, when Studdard was signing CDs at an Atlanta Walmart. Attracted to McCants, the singer followed her to the store’s toy department and requested her phone number
