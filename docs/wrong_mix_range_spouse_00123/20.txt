American Idol’s season 2 winner Ruben Studdard married Surata Zuri McCants at Canterbury United Methodist Church in his hometown of Birmingham, Ala., Saturday with 20 groomsmen at his side.

Studdard, 29, and McCants, 30, obtained a marriage license at the County Probate Office in Columbiana, Ala., last Monday.

The couple met in October 2006, when he was signing CDs at a Wal-Mart in Atlanta. Struck by her beauty, he followed her to the store’s toy department, and requested her phone number.
