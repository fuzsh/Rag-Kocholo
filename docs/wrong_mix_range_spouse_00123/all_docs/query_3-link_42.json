        "text": "Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber first met when the two were introduced by her dad, Stephen Baldwin, at one of Justin's meet-and-greets back in 2009. After dating on and off since 2014, the two finally made things official with a courthouse wedding in 2018. A year later, they celebrated with a reception in South Carolina.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow first caught Chris Martin's attention during Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head tour stop in LA back in 2002. After the show, the singer invited Gwyneth backstage, and sparks flew. Gwyneth and Chris were married from 2003 to 2016 and have two beautiful kids together, daughter Apple and son Moses. Chris has since moved on with Dakota Johnson, while Gwyneth is now married to Brad Falchuk.\n\nNick Cannon and Mariah Carey first crossed paths when he presented her with an award at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, and they began dating three years later. \"At one point, I was like, 'I'ma get Mariah Carey,'\" Nick recalled on TV One's Uncensored. \"It turned from my celebrity crush to like, 'Nah, she's about to be my girlfriend.' People were like, 'You're bugging. There's no way you can get Mariah Carey.' I was like, 'Watch, I'm telling you.'\" Nick and Mariah ended up tying the knot in 2008 but split in late 2014. They have two beautiful kids together, 8-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe.\n\nNick and Vanessa Lachey's relationship began as a friendship after the two met on MTV's TRL.
