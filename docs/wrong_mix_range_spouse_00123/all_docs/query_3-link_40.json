I'm trying to lose weight as well but it's so hard because my grandma always talks me into buying the shittiest food and she only shops at smart and final where they don't even sell fresh vegetables.\n\nAck. Those stores shouldn't even qualify as grocery stores. They should be called convenient stores coz it's pretty much the same stuff as liquor stores but more variety and in bulk.\n\nUgh yes. She thinks just because I'm young I can eat anything and be fine. Nope, it doesn't work that way.\n\nif he couldn't do 1,200 calories, i don't know how he's going to do what they make you do on the biggest loser. it's basically no food and exercising like a mad person. good luck to him though.\n\nThats what I was thinking. If he doesn't have a problem with his weight like he claims and couldn't make it with a well known trainer then I'm not sure how long he will last.\n\nfor his size? nah, he shouldn't eat 1200 calories. he should eat way, way more. he's going to sabotage yourself if he eats that little at his size.\n\nthis. 1200 calories sounds insane\n\nyeah he honestly could eat double that and lose weight consistently at his size\n\nlol how could anyone do 1200 calories tbh\n\nunless you're like 5'0\" or 80 years old, you shouldn't be eating only 1200 calories.. You need to eat above your BMR and below your TDEE to lose weight without wreaking your metabolism\n\n(no subject) - livelikemusicx Expand\n\n(no subject) - andisprohi Expand\n\n(no subject) - leomentlines Expand\n\nyou go girl.\n\nidk, it seems like a lot of people that go on that show take off the weight and put it back on. i've heard the best way is to go about it slowly and take off about a pound a week, and that's what i'm doing.\n\ni'm bummed i have to take a break because i sprained my foot, but i'm still counting calories and will get back to exercising when it's all better. i've lost 20+ lbs so far from the weight i put on when i stress ate through grad school. it's a lifestyle change, not a diet, right?\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nyup, they go home and don't have the support and/or will-power to keep up with it.\n\nI think the bigger reason is because they go from a very controlled environment where they have no access to extra food or things like the internet, TV etc. and they do nothing but work out to an environment where there's extra food just laying around, there's things to do besides exercise, you have responsibilities that you have to deal with that you have to work your work out schedule around, and all that jazz is what causes many of them to gain back the weight. Their diet and exercise regime really aren't sustainable in the real world.\n\nbb there's a reason why they say abs are made in the kitchen :) As long as your diet stays good, you'll still be able to lose even though you can't work out at the moment.\n\ndidn't someone try to pay him to lose weight before? i must be thinking of someone else\n\ni think that might have been when he tried vegetarianism. i kind of remember he was all over Extra with that one.\n\ni remember when he headlined the edmonton singing christmas tree\n\nWhen fat people huff and wheeze like just standing upright is an effort I get really uncomfortable cause I want to help them but it's not like you can hand them an inhaler\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI support you on your crusade\n\nI hope you walk around with stickers that say \"thin privilege\" and slap them on the foreheads of skinny girls\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - norrell Expand\n\n(no subject) - mollysdevice Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - mollysdevice Expand\n\n(no subject) - squishinator Expand\n\n(no subject) - mollysdevice Expand\n\n(no subject) - leomentlines Expand\n\n(no subject) - thalassaemia Expand\n\n(no subject) - blacktinbox Expand\n\n(no subject) - mollysdevice Expand\n\ni hope he does well! me and my mom loved the shit out of him on idol. we even got his album. (i now realize this was 10 years ago...omg)"
