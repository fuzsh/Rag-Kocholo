        "text": "It's Canada Day tomorrow and I have nothing to do\n\nWell its good ol' Canada Day tomorrow and most of us don't have to work tomorrow so there is another whole day out of the week where we can regain our sanity. But what if you have nothing to do? Well.. why don't you go to the beach cause it's so damn hot out?\n\nOr you could call your friends and put together a last minute party. You can make ice-cold girlie drinks and sit around and do each others nails in the sun. Or how about a picnic out with your significant other?? That's always fun, unless it's raining where you are and in that case you could always have an indoor picnic. Those are a lot of fun too and you don't have to deal with the ants crawling up your legs.\n\nThere might be fireworks or block parties around your area tomorrow that are advertised around town or look it up on the Internet. You could just stay at home and watch TV or do some gardening. Or how about working on your tan?? But don't forget to put some sun block on every 30 minutes so you don't turn into a lobster or get some sort of skin disease. It is so important that if you do enjoy the sun, all you have to do is put some sunscreen on and a hat and you'll be fine and protected. How about having a BBQ with your family or getting some errands done that you didn't have a chance to do on the weekend cause you were so lazy.\n\nIf you like shopping spend the whole day in the mall cause everyone else will be on the beach so it probably won't be as packed. Take your pet out for a walk cause I'm sure they would appreciate that. If you don't have a pet how about going to the nearest animal shelter and volunteering for the day. You might want to call first to see if they need any help.\n\nI hope I gave you some helpful suggestions on what to do if you are off on Canada and you have no plans..\n\nI am going to my friends birthday party on the beach.. Damn.. I guess that means its time to pull out the ol' swimsuit..\n\nDamn it!!! Swim suit season comes too fast..\n\nLove Leslie Star\n\nImage taken from http://www.scholarships.ed.ac.uk\n\nRuben marries Surata\n\nRuben Studdard got married to Surata Zuri McCants on Saturday (June 28). The couple actually met when Ruben was signing autographs at a Walmart and he followed Surata into the toy isle and asked for her digits.. Aww.. that is so super cute. I wish that would have happened to me when I met N'Sync at HMV when they were signing autographs.. :)\n\nPeople were talking about this marriage since June 23rd when Ruben obtained a marriage license that only lasted for 30 days in Shelby County, Alabama.\n\nThe wedding was short and sweet being only 30 minutes and had approximately 300 guests. Ruben had 20 groomsman and he wore a white vest and a white bow tie. Surata wore a white and ivory long wedding gown.\n\nWhen the wedding was over they drove away in an ivory Cadillac Escalade to their reception at the Rosewood Hall at SoHo Square in Homewood.\n\nCongrats to Ruben and Surata! How cute!!\n\nImage taken from http://www.foxnews.com\n\nAmy WInehouse punches a fan\n\nHoly shit this bitch is nuts. Apparently some fan tried to grab her beehive and the bitch went bunkers. I guess no one is suppose to touch that nasty weave.\n\nCome on Amy.. You sounded horrible at Nelson Mandela's birthday party and you sounded horrible during this performance so the least you could do for your fans is not elbow them and punch them in the face when they probably lined up for hours just to see you and your pathetic comeback..\n\nGet your shit together..\n\nAnd when you are performing concentrate on sounding better and not so much on the way your beehive looks.\n\nTim Mcgraw's fight with Marcus Nirschl\n\nMarcus Nirschl who is a huge fan of Tim Mcgraw, paid $120.00 for a 3rd row seat at Tim's concert in Auburn, Washington. Marcus says that he was making his way up to his seat when he was pushed by many fans to move out of their way because they all wanted to see Tim sing \"Indian Outlaw\" too.\n\nMarcus says that he was getting shoved up against empty seats and he just bent down to pick up his cowboy hat and he lost his balance and the next thing he knew... Tim Mcgraw was grabbing him by his belt and yanking him up on the stage while calling security over the microphone.\n\nHe recalls that he then saw Tim's fist back ready to punch his lights out and Marcus says he is still confused about it. He says that he wasn't drunk but he had a couple of beers and also says that if he was drunk he wouldn't remember anything, \"But I remember it all.\"\n\nHe says he wants to go back to Tim's upcoming concerts because he really loves his music and he still doesnt understand it all.\n\nI think that Tim must have saw Marcus pulling a woman's hair or pushing someone because I don't think that Tim would just pull him up on stage and get security to swarm him if nothing was wrong.\n\nWho knows.. I wasn't there, but it could all be just a misunderstanding.. And if it is, Tim should give him free tickets for him and his whole family for life :)\n\nChristiano Ronaldo = Hottie\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is one piece of hot sexy man meat. I think he is just the hottest thing. I use to think that no one could beat my husband, David Beckham but this guy... WOW!!!!!!!! Now I don't know about that anymore..\n\nI saw his pictures from his vacation and oh my good lord.. what a hot body. And his girlfriend is pretty hot too.\n\nDamn bitch! :)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on Feb 5th 1985 which makes him an aquarius like me, in Funchal Madeira. He's a Portuguese football player who plays as right winger for the Portuguese national team, Manchester United.\n\nHe's 6ft. 1 and every inch of him is just pure loveliness. He was named after Ronald Regan because that was his fathers favorite actor and U.S. President at the time. He has a brother and two sisters.\n\nI just wanted to show everyone how smoking hot he is.. He get's a Leslie Star award.\n\nCongrats to you Cristiano!!!\n\nImage taken from http://www.goalvideoz.com\n\nLil Mama feat. T-Pain \"What it is\"\n\nMay I first start out by saying that this video is so good with lots of colors and I like how Lil Mama changes her 'do and all, but the song is kind of flat to me.\n\nThe only part I like is when T-Pain sings in it and that doesn't happen very often. Other than that the song lacks a little something. I was just hoping through the whole thing that some magical chorus would come along and resuce the it but that never happened.\n\nI like Lil Mama and I think that with T-Pain on her track it could have been a lot better.\n\nWhat do you think??\n\nFlo Rida & Will.I.Am with \"In the Ayar\"\n\nThis new song \"In the Ayar\" by Flo Rida featuring Will.I.Am is pretty good besides the fact that it's called \"Ayer\" instead of \"Air\". But I guess they want to look a bit more gansta:) Half the time I can't understand what they are saying but that's have the fun I guess.\n\nThis is the 3rd single off his new CD \"Mail On Sunday.\"\n\nI hope all of you dance like there is no tomorrow to this song.\n\nShake your sh*t!!\n\nIf you would like to know the actual lyrics to the song click here\n\nFlo Rida - In The Ayer Video\n\nJust press play..\n\nMini Me's Sex Tape\n\nVern Troyer/Mini Me has a sex tape out!!!!!!!!! Oh my gosh.. When I first heard that he had a sex tape I started laughing so hard that I was actually crying. I didn't even know that his pecker was big enough to even have sex... especially to a girl that is not a little person.\n\nVern has always been a little pervie to me with his scooter on \"Surreal Life.\"\n\nI kind of wish he was doing another midget cause that would be hilarious. This video only has 21 seconds of him and his girlfriend making out disgustingly but hopefully soon the whole video will surface..\n\nCan't wait.. hahaha..\n\nBritney Spears fears she will die at 27\n\nOk.. I love Britney and all but what the hellis going on with her?? According to Ian Halperin, the guy that spent 18 months following the pop star posing as a paparazzi to get some good secret information about her, said that Spears told him personally that she fears that her life will end just like Kurt Cobain's and Janice Joplin's did at 27.\n\nBritney's birthday is not till December 2nd so I guess she has a while to wait before she knows for sure.\n\nThis all could have been when she was being drugged by Sam Lufti. Who knows what he put in her cheetos :) Ian Halperin is a journalist and plans to write the book and have it on the shelves by Christmas.\n\nHopefully she's not dead by then. That would be so sad :(\n\nImage taken from http://dillsnapcogitation.files.wordpress.com\n\nPatrick Kennedy escapes death row\n\nPatrick Kennedy has been in Louisiana's death row since 2003 for raping his 8-year old stepdaughter on March 2, 1998. He raped her in her own bed and caused internal injuries and bleeding to the poor little girl. She had to get many surgeries after to correct what he did wrong to her.\n\nPatrick is the only one on death row for rape besides Richard L. Davies who along with his girl friend Melissa Ticer sexually abused a child from October 2004 till January 2005.\n\nToday (June 25) the Supreme Court ruled that child rapists couldn't be executed because the punishment would be too harsh. I don't really understand this.. If you cause that much harm and pain to someone I think you should be executed.\n\nWhat good does he do in this society if he could hurt a harmless 8 years old that was his own step-daughter? Imagine what he would do if he didn't even know the child.\n\nPatrick Kennedy would have been the first convicted rapist executed in 44 years. But now he still gets to live. Which in my opinion is a shame.\n\nImage from http://media3.washingtonpost.com\n\nThe Saturdays - If this is love\n\nHave you ever heard of S Club Juniors? Well this new band \"The Saturdays\" are relatively new and they are from the UK and Frankie Sandford and Rochelle Wiseman are from Sclub. Also in the group are Mollie King, Una Healy and Vanessa White and they are all really pretty. Their song \"If this is love\" is super cheezmo but the video has good clothes and lots of funky colors to grab your attention. It is as cheesy as S Club use to be and they sort of sound like them too. I think maybe this band will be a one hit wonder but you never know... they might turn really slutty and we might have another \"Danity Kane\" on our hands and then everyone wants to see how trampy they can get.\n\nRemember.. sex sells!!\n\nTheir record label is the same one that \"Girls Aloud\" are on and their new upcoming CD is called \"Set me off.\" Tell me what you think about it...\n\nColby O'Donis feat. Akon - What you got\n\nDoesn't Akon ever go away? I mean he's good but I can stop thinking about how I heard on the radio that he's not even a convict. You can go to this website too and they will fill you in on the whole story. That just makes me laugh... all those time he sings.. \"convict music\" and he never even went to jail..\n\nWhat a joke..\n\nI also didn't like the fact that he threw that fan into the audience at his concert a while ago.\n\nBut never the less this song is good.. not great but good.\n\nGeorge Carlin died at 71\n\nGeorge Carlin died yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, CA at the age of 71. He was complaining about chest pains and he later passed away at 5:55 pm. He was a great comedian, author and actor. He wasn't afraid to talk about everything that people were too scared to talk about. Carlin had been in good health since suffering his third heart attack in 1991.\n\nHe was born in New York City and grew up on West 121st Street in Manhattan, which his friends and him use to call \"White Harlem\" because it sounded a lot tougher than its real name Morningside Heights.\n\nHis father left when he was just two years old and his mother took care of him. He dropped out of school when he was 14 from Cardinal Hayes High School. After a few years he joined the United States Air Force and he trained as a radar technician. Later he worked as a DJ and stayed with that for a while before he started comedy on his own.\n\nIn 1961 he met his soon to be wife Brenda Hosbrook who later died of liver cancer on May 11th 1997. They had a little girl together, Kelly who was born in 1963.\n\nGeorge had a problem with drugs, painkillers and alcohol and in December 2004 he checked himself into rehab.\n\nGeorge has been in such great movies like \"Dogma,\" \"Scary Movie 3\" and \"Cars.\" He had many HBO specials, books and CD's that he put out.\n\nGeorge Carlin will be greatly missed and if you aren't familiar with him here are some clips I found of him on Youtube.com.\n\nRobyn - Be Mine\n\nThis song is kinda old but I thought that all of you might not have heard it.\n\nI love love love love this song and I would love to listen to this song while driving fast down the highway (but being careful of course and doing the speed limit) and turning this song up as loud as it could go.\n\nThere are two versions of this video so let me know which one you like the best!!!\n\nRobyn is just the best ever!!!\n\nComments on this song perhaps????\n\nNew Song by Future Stars - Mohawk Song\n\nMy friend told me to go on www.youtube.com today and watch this video by \"Future Stars\" called \"Mohawk.\" At first I didn't like the song but the more I listened to it the more I liked it. It hasn't got a lot of hits, only 258 right now but hopefully from me posting it more people will listen.\n\nTheir Myspace page is http://myspace.com/mohawksong if you are interested in them.\n\nThey just need a bit better of a video cause its kinda fuzzy but the song is good so thats all that really matters.. Hope you like them.\n\nFeeling too hot this summer?\n\nPaletas are a Mexican frozen treat that you can make at home easily and just pull them out of the freezer when you get too hot this summer. They are very good for little kids too and they can help make them. Paletas is Spanish for \"little stick\"... I should have called some of my boyfriends that.. hehehe.\n\nPaletas are frozen juice, milk, or frozen berries that you just add milk and sugar too in those plastic mold things that you make Popsicles in.\n\nYou can make them out of hot chocolate with milk and water. You can make the popsicle to be anything you want and they are a healthy treat for summer. To make one with bananas click here.\n\nI hope you enjoy your frozen Paletas this summer and stay cool.\n\nImage taken from http://mimicooks.files.wordpress.com\n\nToilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest\n\nKatrina Chalifoux of Rockford, Illinois won the Toilet Paper Wedding Dress Contest this year. She won a whopping $1,000 bucks for it. It took her 2 weeks to complete and it is just beautiful. With many woman in my life getting married I really do appreciate how long this must have taken her and it is so detailed.\n\nI think she should have won more than 1,000 but who am I to say.\n\nShe used 7 rolls of toilet paper to make the train and the dress. The six wedding dresses that competed were displayed at Ripley's Believe It or Not! in New York City.\n\nI wonder if shes actually going to wear that dress on her wedding. What if it rains that day.. Oh boy.. That would not be good.:)\n\nTo see this dress Click here\n\nHere are some more examples of toilet paper wedding dresses\n\nImage taken from http://www.elanso.com\n\nImage taken from http://cache.viewimages.com\n\nAmy Winehouse fainted due to drug use\n\nAmy Winehouse better get her shit together fast. The 24 year old talented singer is killing herself due to her drug use. She has been warned that she must quit her drug abuse or she will most likely die..\n\nWell duh!! Of course.. She's so skinny and all her teeth are falling out. That is certainly not a good sign.\n\nAmy was hospitalized on Monday after collapsing and she had a whole bunch of tests done on why she's not doing so hot. Her doctors are saying that Amy's fainting could have been caused by her well known drug overdose last summer. You would think with all her money that she would be able to afford to go to treatment and get better but I guess the drugs are part of her life now and its going to be damn hard to get rid of them..\n\nI am begging you Amy.. Go on Intervention. They can help you.\n\nImage taken from http://i.dailymail.co.uk\n\nJaime Lynn Spears had a girl\n\nJamie Lynn Spears who is just 17 had a baby girl with her fiance Casey Aldridge who is 19. They named her Maddie Briann which is a very pretty name. Her sister Britney Spears and the family all went to the Mississippi hospital in McComb Ms., where they waited for Jaime Lynn to give birth.\n\nShe had an induced labour because the baby just wouldn't come out. Maddie Briann was 6 pounds 10 ounces. Aww.. how cute.\n\nJaime just recently bought a house in Liberty Miss. to start a family in. She has been living in Kentwood La. since December to take care of herself with her family while she was pregnant. Jamie and Casey have been engaged since March and are getting married once they have settled in with the baby and everything.\n\nCongrats to Jaime Lynn and Casey and hopefully they will stay together forever and the baby will grow up to be more normal and not like Maddie's Aunt, Britney:)\n\nImage taken from www.babble.com\n\nNew Pussy Cat Dolls \"When I Grow Up\"\n\nI don't personally like this song because I think its really annoying and they are doing nothing but whining but I thought that some of you may like their new video \"When I Grow Up.\"\n\nI do however like their dance moves and Nicole's yellow bra shirt thing when the video hits 2:58 and I like the way the song sounds when they are dancing cause it's completely different from the original song which is a bonus for me.\n\nHope you like it.. or don't.. whatever!\n\nVanessa Hudgens new single \"SneakerNight\" Review\n\nSo I was looking around www.youtube.com and I noticed that Vanessa Hudgens from the Disney Channels movie \"High school Musical\" had a new song called \"Sneakernight\" so I watched it. I thought that the video was alright because it was colorful and it didn't have the usual big booty ho's in the background or the expensive cars. It was just her and her friends going out and having fun and she has to wear her sneakers cause they are going to dance all night long. The song stank though. It was a real bad stench too.\n\nWhat kind of crap is that song anyways??\n\nWere the people who made this song deaf or what? I guess it was good for little girls that listen to music but Vanessa is 20 now and should be coming up with better songs than that. Especially since in Aug 2007 on the Teen Choice Awards she was named Choice Breakout Singer and beat out Amy Winehouse, Katharine McPhee, Corrine Bailey Raie and Lily Allen.\n\nMaybe she is trying to get her innocent reputation back since she had those naked pictures of herself leaked all over the world on Sept 6th 2007. Once that happens no one forgets sh*t like that.\n\nThere are other songs on her upcoming CD \"Identified\" like \"Hook Me Up\" that are better than \"Sneakernight\". But hey, she's just starting out so her label might be making her sing these cheesy songs. Who knows...\n\nWhat I did yesterday\n\nYesterday my Grandpa, boyfriend and I went on a train because it is something my grandpa has never done before so I thought we would take a train ride. Unfortunately the air conditioning was broken and it was so hot and you couldn't open the windows so we were all burning up for 32 minutes (that's how long the train takes). My friend picked us up on the other end and drove us home, which was so nice of her.\n\nAfter getting home we were all exhausted after the train ride and me working all day so we just relaxed in front of the TV. It was Monday night so my favorite show was on... Intervention. I just love it and my boyfriend doesn't but he didnt mind that I had to watch 3 episodes = 3 hours.. hehehe..\n\nThen I saw that \"I Know Who Killed Me\" with Lindsay Lohan was on and I have heard how bad it was but I had to watch it to see for myself. So we started watched it and shortly after my boyfriend fell asleep.\n\nWhen he woke up he said, \"I can't believe you are still watching this crap. I know who killed me, you did when you made me watch this movie.\" I thought that was funny because you know, I never thought a movie could be that bad. I heard it was bad but never in a million years did I know it was going to be that terrible. I don't really think it was Lindsay's fault either because the script was so bad and I think she did what she could to make it a bit better. But let me tell you... Save yourself whatever you do and Don't Watch It!!!!!!!\n\nUnless your like me and you just want to see how bad it really is..\n\nLil Waynes New Song \"3Peat\"\n\nLil Wayne was born named Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. on Sept. 27 1982 in New Orleans Louisiana. He dropped out of school when he was 14 and became a father to a precious little girl named Reginae Carter with his highschool girlfriend, Antonia \"Toya\" Johnson. They later divorced. He was also in the video for Destiny's Child \"Soldier\".\n\nHe has been arrested for smoking marijuana, carrying guns, possesion of cocaine and ecstasy. Lil Wayne has been in lots of trouble and he's the ripe young age of 25.\n\nHis new song is called \"3 Peat\" and its kinda filthy but I think it would be great to listen to if you were wasted at a club or cruzing around in your car in the summer or something. I wish there was more of a chorus though but the still sticks in my head. It doesn't have an official video yet but hope you like it anyway.\n\nSolange Knowles new video \"I Decided\"\n\nSolange Piaget Knowles Smith is Beyonce's younger sister. She was born in Houston Texas on June 24th 1986. She was in the Destiny's Child video \"Soldier\" where she was pregnant with her son Daniel. She was married to Daniel Smith, a football player, in February 2004 and they got divorced in October 2007.\n\nHer first single video off her new album is called \"I Decided\" and it premiered on June 4th on BET. She is now starting from scratch with her new song and it is a bit like the surpremes and I think that the video is good and she has grown up a lot since her first video \"Feeling You\".\n\nMadonna and Pharell's new video \"Give it 2 me\"\n\nThe song \"Give it 2 me\" is off of Madonna's new CD \"Hard Candy.\" I have liked Madonna for a long time and she always keeps in style and rocks some wicked clothes and hair dos. She always keeps it fresh and this CD is pretty good as well. She shacked up with other artists like Justin Timberlake and Pharell and made her CD something that everyone would like. Some of the songs on there are a little weird but it's Madonna so I let it slide ;) I hope you like this song and the video. Here goes it!\n\nR. Kelly.. Not guilty?\n\nWhat is this world coming to? How could the jury find him not guilty?\n\nR. Kelly was charged with 14 counts of videotaping himself having sex with an underage girl, who was 13 or 14.\n\nIf he was convicted he would have had to do 4 - 15 years of hard time in jail and he would have had to register as a sex offender in Illinois. I use to love R. Kelly when he came out with his CD \"12 Play\" with \"Bump and Grind\" on it. I loved that song so much I wore out my CD player.:)\n\nI think the reason that they let him off was because the star witness, a woman who said she had sex with R. Kelly and the underage girl, her family said that she wasn't the woman in the video so the jurors now really had nothing to link R. Kelly to the video.\n\nBut what about the mole on his back that matched the one in the video??\n\nVideo forensics expert Grant Fredericks even froze frames of the sex tape where a dark spot was visible on the man in the video's back in the courtroom. Fredericks showed the jury a photo taken of Kelly's back after his arrest in 2002 that showed a fingernail-sized mole.\n\n\"There is a mark on the man's back in the exact same position,\" Fredericks said, referring to the tape.\n\nSo now R. Kelly is free to roam and screw more little girls.. Gross!!\n\nDoesn't anyone remember that Aaliyah and R. Kelly got married when Aailyah was just 15 years old and he was 27? They had a secret wedding on August 31, 1994 and everyone gossiped about it for months wondering if it was true or not but then Vibe magazine published their marriage license and that shut everyone up. Aaliyah lied and said that she was 18 on the license so the marriage was invalid and then was annulled.\n\nNow tell me that he doesn't like little girls.. eww.. hes so greasy..\n\nThis question is for R. Kelly: Do you still think that \"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number?\"... Probably.. EWWWWWWWW\n\nImage from www.whosdatedwho.com\n\nWhat the hell are they doing together?\n\nHaven't they got together, been married, been divorce, separated like a million times?? Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee are trying their relationship once again and hopefully for the last time. You think they would learn after a while, that history does repeat itself. Honestly I guess they are made for each other because they are both a little whacked.\n\nTommy Lee said in an interview with Rolling Stone, \"Pamela and the kids have moved in with me. It's awesome, man. It's definitely working. You can tell on the kids' faces - they're happy when we're together. We've only given it a try 800 times - 801, here we go.\"\n\nI know this has nothing to do with what I was talking about but Pam Anderson needs to dye her hair like chestnut brown and tone down her makeup. She can still wear all the booby clothes she wants cause she still has a hot body, but from the neck up she needs a big change. She can still be a sexy woman without blonde hair. I guess that is what made her famous but you think she would want something different but history shows a little different story...\n\nPamela and Tommy's Love And Hate Time Line\n\nMarried for the first time on Feb 19th 1995 after knowing each other for 96 hours and that lasted till 1998.\n\nHad two children, Brandon now 12 (June 6th 1996) and Dylon now 10 (Dec 29 1997). (oh yeah and they had that little sex tape incident)\n\nDuring 1997 she filed for divorce from him twice, accused him of hitting her in front of the kids and kicking her when she was holding their baby in her arms. They then got back together twice before the couple broke up for good until now besides sleeping together here and there.\n\nSince her divorce she has been engaged to Marcus Schenkenberg (broke up in 2001) and singer Kid Rock and only eventually married Kid Rock. Pam and Kid Rock broke up in 2003 and then later married on July 29 2006. She got divorced from Kid Rock on November 27 2006, 17 days after she had a miscarriage in Vancouver shooting a movie on November 10, 2006.\n\nOn Oct 6 2007 (this girl moves around fast) she married Paris Hilton's ex scumbag Rick Soloman (the guy that filmed the night vision sex tape of Paris Hilton). They later divorced because claimed fraud on February 22 2008.\n\nAnd now they are together again to repeat the whole bloody cycle all over.\n\nWhen will she learn??\n\nImage taken from www.zimbio.com\n\nMariah Carey's remix of Bye Bye with Akon and Lil Wayne\n\nI was on www.youtube.com like I always am because it's just as bad as my facebook addiction, and I saw that Mariah Carey had remixed her new song \"Bye Bye\" and the best part is that Akon and Lil Wayne are on it too. It's still nothing that would be played at a club or anything but it's better than the original. The song before was a bit too slow and I am so glad they made a remix. I still think that they song is a bit cheesy but the remix definatly helped it. Hope you like it!\n\nLinda Hogan is a craddle robber\n\nWhat is Linda Hogan doing with a 19 year old that looks like a younger and hotter version of Hulk Hogan? His name is Charlie Hill and he looks as if he has had his fair share of partying days. Shouldn't she wait until her divorce is finalized before she jumps into bed with a boy that is younger that her daughter?\n\nPoor Brooke, she has the very worst of it all. Her brother is in jail while her Mom humps her friend from highschool and he Dad humps her other best friend that looks like her.\n\nYikes!!\n\nWhatever happend to trying to make up with each other or staying together for the kids?? It looks as if they are trying to one up each other and date people that look like their kids. The whole thing is so messed up. I guess it shows that no matter how much money people have they still have problems that money can't fix.\n\nAlso.. What the hell is Nick Hogan complaining about in jail? I mean he's walking and breathing on his own and that is more than his friend John Graziano is doing in the hospital. He has been in critical care since August 26th of last year and Nick and his family have the guts to complain that his jail cell is too small and he has no one to talk to.\n\nPoor Nick..\n\nOH PLEASE!!!!\n\nImage taken from www.zimbio.com\n\nThe Olson's love their prunes\n\nSo this is pretty much the strangest thing I have heard in a long time. In order for the Olson twins to smile in pictures they mutter \"prune\" to themselves before the camera flashes. I guess that makes them laugh. How odd. Don't they have anything to smile about besides that?? They can buy anything they want, get whatever boyfriends they want and they always have each other's love. Isn't that enough?? I guess not.\n\nMay I say that Ashley Olson has really been coming out of her shell lately? Who would have known that she had such a beautiful smile? She really has been dressing well recently too. Before both the sisters look like fashionable bag ladies but now it looks as if they are growing up and becoming beautiful woman. Now we just need Mary-Kate to smile more and if saying \"prune\" does it then they should say it all the time.\n\nImage taken from www.fashionforbreakfast.wordpress.com\n\nKate Hudson's hair helpers\n\nKate is helping her good friend David Babaii promote his new hair product called WildAid. They don't test it on animals and it supports animal rights advocacy. Ms. Hudson is also a partner with David with this new product.\n\nThey use ingrediants like Blue Algae, Cupuacu Butter from the Amazon, and Wild Orchid. It is also Sulfate, Paraben, Petroleum Free and cruetly free. They are all made with Recycled or Non-Virgin Materials.\n\nThey have shampoo, conditioner, styling products and also straighteners and blowdryers. They are all at resonable prices and you can either shop online at http://www.db4wildaid.com or www.drugstore.com.\n\nIf you buy these products you will be helping in the fight to save endangered species. To learn a bit more about these products please go to www.wildaid.org.\n\nImage taken from www.ecollo.com\n\nChicken Cruelty\n\nI love Pamela Anderson cause she cares so much about animals. Here she is in a video I found on youtube.com and I dont ever want to eat chicken again in my life. KFC should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nI can honestly say that I will never eat at KFC again.\n\nHow horrible!!!\n\nTori Spelling and Dean McDermott welcome a new baby\n\nTori Spelling gave birth to a 6-pound 8-ounce baby girl named Stella Doreen McDermott on Monday. Tori had a C-Section at Los Angeles hospital. Her and her husband Dean now have 2 children together and Dean has another child from his first marriage.\n\nThey have been married since May 2006 and they also star in the hit show \"Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood\", which is such a good show. I use to watch Tori on \"Beverly Hills 90210\" all the time as Donna and I was addicted to that show.\n\nCongrats to the couple and their son Liam Aaron who is now 1 year old!!\n\nImage taken from www.indiebusinessblog.com\n\nKaty Perry - \"I Kissed A Girl\"\n\nKaty Perry is the new thang for the summer with her smash hit. \"I kissed a girl.\" Her name is Katy Perry now but she was actually born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson. She was born on Oct 25th 1984 which makes her a Scorpio and she can sting me anytime she wants to. :)\n\nI heard her song on the radio tonight with my friend while we were stuck in the worst traffic I will ever experience in a life time and this song made the rest of the way more enjoyable. My favorite part is where she says \"Cherry Chapstick.\"\n\nIt is my new favorite song. Love it so much!!! I hope she becomes super famous and she kicks some serious star ass.\n\nHer website is www.katyperry.com or her MySpace page is www.myspace.com/katyperry.\n\nGo visit her.\n\nTomatoes not good for you?\n\nIn the United States the FDA is calling this \"a state of crisis\" warning people not to eat raw red Roma, plum or red round tomatoes due to a salmonella outbreak. Buyers may eat cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, tomatoes with the vine attached and tomatoes that you grow at home.\n\nAll the fast food joints in the states have pulled anything with tomatoes in it and so are the restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nArkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Belgium, Dominican Republic, California, Guatemala, Israel, Netherlands, Canada, and Puerto Rico are not included in this outbreak of samonella.\n\nIf you experience any vomitting, fever, diarrhea or any stomach or abdominal pain please go to the hospital immediately as it has affected 150 people so far and 23 of them are far more serious and are hospitalized. No deaths have been reported yet thankfully.\n\nImage taken from www.hort.purdue.edu.com\n\nAmy Winehouse Racist Video\n\nAmy Winehouse was videotaped by her soon to be ex husband Blake. He taped Amy and her friend in their house with a whole bunch of drug parifanailia around singing a horribly racist song. I am sure that people have done things in their life they are not quite proud of but to have it on tape for the whole world to see must be so embarrassing.\n\nI know that Amy shouldn't have sung that song but I am sure it was suppose to be a joke and she didn't know the whole universe would be watching..\n\nThat damn Blake needs to go!!!!!\n\nQuick Girlie Tips\n\nIf you girls would like some good tips on hair or makeup advice, please go and see www.pursebuzz.com. It is a good website to show you tips on how to quickly put your hair up in the morning or how to makeup if your in a rush. I found it on www.youtube.com. I hope you learn a lot of tips from the girl on the video. I think she's just great!\n\nLove this song!\n\nThis is Duffy. She is so awesome and I can't get this damn song out of my brain. It's called \"Mercy\". Hope ya like it. She also has songs like \"Rockberry\", \"Cry to Me\", \"Stepping Stone.\" She kind of sounds like Amy Winehouse/Adele/Nelly Furtado all mixed together. I really like the song \"Syrup and Honey\" too. Check all these songs out on www.youtube.com\n\nYou Just Never Know\n\nA little boy named Johnny Jackson, just 10 years old died in his bed alone in South Carolina on Sunday. He went swimming in his neighborhood pool and then went home. When he got home his mother noticed that he wasn't acting right. He started to slur his speech, wasn't breathing properly and he was extremely tired. These are all the signs of what is called \"Dry\" drowning. His mother just told him to go and take a nap and an hour later Johnny passes away.\n\nNot much water is needed to cause drowning in your lungs. Just as little as 1 ounce of water could kill a child. Water blocks the flap that helps you breathe and if that is blocked you will die.\n\nThe saddest thing is, if his mother knew the symptoms of it, it could have saved his life if she would have taken him to the hospital. She must feel so terrible.\n\nI never knew there was such a thing as \"dry\" drowning either.\n\nSo sad!!\n\nImage taken from www.abcnews.go.com\n\nNew hot songs for the hot beach\n\nRhianna - Disturbia\n\nNerd - Spaz\n\nUsher - Moving Mountains\n\nUsher - Will Work For love\n\nFergie - Pick It Up (a little slower)\n\nFergie - Lables Or Love\n\nCherish - Amnesia\n\nNelly Furtado - Runaway\n\nNe-Yo - I Was In Love\n\nNe-Yo - Go On Girl\n\nNe-Yo - Closer\n\nUsher - What's Your Name\n\nBeyonce & Lil Mama - Rotate\n\nChristina Millian - So Deep So fast\n\nLil Wayne - I Am Hip Hop ( a rip of Naz's If I Ruled The World)\n\nNatasha Bedingfield - Soulmate (slow song)\n\nChris Brown & Keri Hilson - Superhuman\n\nChris Brown - Fire\n\nChris Brown - Throwed\n\nLL Cool J - Cry\n\nKarina - 16 @ War\n\nYoung Jeezy - Put On\n\nRick Ross - Here I Am\n\nThe Dream - I Love You Girl (Remix)\n\nOriginal Song by Leslie\n\nI wrote this song for my boyfriend Robert a year ago and just recently thought about putting it up on Youtube.com. I hope that you all like it and sorry if my guitar skills are scratchy. I tried!!\n\nNew Video by Cherish\n\nThis is the new single from \"Cherish.\" It's called Amnesia and it sounds a lot like Gone by \"N'Sync.\" I like this song but it is a little slow. It definatly needs a remix. Hope you like it.\n\nCanceling his show broke his little heart\n\nKelsey Grammer was paddle boarding in Hawaii at Kona with his wife Camilla on Saturday, when he felt the symptoms of a heart attack. They quickly went to the hospital to check out what could be wrong. His heart did stop for a few seconds and he had a mild heart attack at the age of 53.\n\nJust weeks ago he found out that his new show, \"Back to you\" had been canceled. I watched that show once and I understand why it got canned. It was funny at times but not funny enough I guess.\n\nIt must be sad though when you put your soul into a role and then it doesn't get portrayed the way you pictured it.\n\nHe is still in a Honolulu hospital and if everything goes good then he will be released early this week. I wish him all the best!\n\nGet it in a flash\n\nHave you ever been without a car and you just need it for a couple of hours or the whole day?? Www.zipcar.com is the perfect thing for you then. If you have a clean driving record and live in North America or London you are eligible to drive a Zip.\n\nInsurance is covered and if you don't think you will be driving a lot you would get the 55$ annual fee or if you think you will be using it more you pay 50$ a month.\n\nIn June of 2000 the first Zip Car was put on the roads. I have heard people at work talking about it and actually selling their cars and then getting a Zipcar membership. When you sign up for a zip car you get a access key and swipe it on the car. The keys will be inside and you can get gas at any station and pay for it using the gas card. The only thing is you have to return the car where you found it in the time that you have reserved it, just like you would a rental.\n\nWhat a great idea! If you are going to school and can't really afford a car or you live downtown and you only need a car when you are going a far distance then this is the perfect plan for you.\n\nI wish I would have thought of all this.. I would be super rich.. Damn my luck!!:)\n\nGo big for summer??\n\nTop 20 things to buy before summer hits\n\n1. Bright pink nail polish, Orangey red nail polish\n\n2. Big funky sunglasses\n\n3.

I went to watch \"Sex and the city\" this weekend, and I fell in love with Jason Lewis (Samantha's boyfriend, Smith Jerrod).\n\nHe is almost as hot as David Beckham but he doesn't have the fruity voice like David so he gets bonus points for that. His body is so tight and ahhhh.. he just takes me breath away. My boyfriend watched the marathon of the series this weekend and I kept going.. \"Oh my god.. he is so hot..\"\n\nHe was born on June 25th 1971 in Newport Beach, California. He has been on several TV shows like, \"Beverly Hills 90210\" and \"Charmed.\" If you have never seen \"Sex and the City\" you should watch it just to see him. It is worth every single second..\n\nHe shacked up with Rosario Dawson and then Jennifer Aniston.\n\nHe scored 5th place in the reader's poll, sexiest men in Hollywood.\n\nWOW!!!!\n\nImage taken from www.allposters.com\n\nHeidi and Spencers new website\n\nSo I saw on www.perezhilton.com this morning that Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag had their own website. I went there and I wasn't too impressed. I thought it would be prettier and have more info about them to look at. I voted on weather or not I think they should get married and it didn't even work. It said PAGE NOT FOUND..\n\nI like the idea of them having a website about the stars and gossip because they must know some good juicy gossip since they are acquaintances with the stars but nothing thrilled when I went to the page.\n\nI clicked on the paparazzi button to see shots of Heidi with her fake boobies and her fake lips sticking out her chest so much it looks as if she might fall over. I don't like how they are so cheesy. But maybe that is their \"thing\" to make it so they stand out. I just clicked on the shop button and went to Heidiwood.. hahahaha.. and you could pick out clothing from her new line and see what goes best with everything. I thought that was a good idea. You can also see her wearing it all and you can buy everything you see. It really bothered me that there was only xs,s,m,l.\n\nWhat about people that are average size XL? I guess they are shit out of luck.\n\nWho knows.. Not a fan of the site though besides laughing at Heidi's poses. Go there and have a chuckle like me. www.speidiweb.com\n\nImage taken from www.americansuperstarmag.com\n\n25,000 people visit Universal Studios in one day\n\nIn Los Angeles, California this morning at 4:45 a fire was reported at Universal Studios. As many as 50,000 rolls of film like \"I Love Lucy\" and many other shows were damaged this morning when it went up in flames. Most of them were replicas and the new ones were stored at another location.\n\nThe damages include, the clock from \"Back to the future\" and the court yard used in \"Spider-Man 2\" and \"Bruce Almighty.\" Many building fronts that are used in filming were damaged as well. More than 2 city blocks were on fire and there is still smoke burning. There were helicopters and about 300 firefighters trying to put out the fire.\n\nIt's so sad that all those tapes are ruined and especially the clock from \"Back to the future\" because I love that scene in the movie.\n\nThey are investigating why the fire happened. Someone probably did it on purpose. Such a shame.\n\nApparently the back lot tram will open on Monday. That is pretty sad for people that are just visiting LA and planned on going to the park for a day of fun and now they will just get a lot of smoke. People were lined up outside the gates this morning wanting to all get in.\n\nThis is the second fire in 20 years and the first fire caused 25 million dollars worth of damaged and that one was set in 1990 by a security guard who got 4 years in prison for arson."
