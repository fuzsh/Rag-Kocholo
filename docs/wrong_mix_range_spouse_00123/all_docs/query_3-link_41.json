        "text": "We all laughed at former ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù champ Ruben Studdard for marrying Surata Zuri McCants back in 2008, and I don‚Äôt think any one was really surprised last November when Studdard announced he and his booty shakin‚Äô boo were over.\n\n[READ: Ruben Studdard and His ‚ÄòTip Drill‚Äô Boo Break Up‚Ä¶ ]\n\nWell the divorce is now final and surprisingly Ruben has walked away from a marriage we all gave the side-eye SCOTT FREE.\n\nThe judge even ruled Studdard can take the engagement ring with him! üòØ\n\nDetails‚Ä¶\n\nThanks to an ironclad prenup, Ruben just went through the cleanest divorce ever.\n\nRuben filed for divorce in November from his wife Surata Zuri McCants, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was recently finalized in January.\n\nAccording to TMZ,\n\nIt got hairy at first ‚Äî Zuri tried to get the judge in their divorce case to nullify the prenup, claiming Ruben blindsided her with the documents just days before the wedding, unfairly pressuring her into signing them.\n\nBut the judge wasn‚Äôt buying it ‚Äî upholding the prenup, and awarding Zuri close to ZILCH in the divorce.\n\nAccording to the final judgment, Ruben was not ordered to pay ANY spousal support or alimony ‚Ä¶ and he gets to keep their home plus all his belongings ‚Äî jewelry, pensions, royalties, clothing, and all his cash. It was even ordered Zuri return the engagement ring.\n\nSo what did Zuri get out of the deal? Her wedding dress, her photo albums, a 2006 BMW (which Ruben will pay off), a $10,ooo property settlement, $2,000 for attorneys fees, and her maiden name.\n\nUmmmm‚Ä¶. somebody must have only got through the first few chapters of Tariq Nasheed‚Äôs The Art Of Gold Digging. Clearly she didn‚Äôt finish the book!\n\nWelp‚Ä¶ I guess congratulations are in order for Mr. Studdard. You DID that boo!\n\nBut that ring shoulda been off limits, in my opion. I could see if you two were merely engaged but you were MARRIED.? She at least earned the dayum ring! *sigh*\n\nShould a husband ever take back the ring during a divorce?\n\nThoughts?"
