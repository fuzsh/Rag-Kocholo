Well now we get to see Studdard hopefully take the crown in yet another competition…The Biggest Loser!\n\nAccording to the 35-year-old singer, his family has health issues that could be caused by unhealthy weight, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and other heart related issues. Studdard stated that he has not had any problems with these but he believes that if he does not put his weight under control while he can, he could face these issues later in life. While Studdard was married to his now ex-wife Surata Zuri McCants, he lost a lot of weight; unfortunately, after the two split and divorced, the singer gained a lot of the pounds back.\n\nRuben Studdard has made a great decision to put this under control by joining The Biggest Loser cast this upcoming fall season. Being the first celebrity to join this show, he is creating a legacy hopefully to encourage healthy bodies in the Hollywood scene."
