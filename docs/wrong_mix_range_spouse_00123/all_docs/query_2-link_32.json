        "text": ", Alabama -- When\n\nwas showered with confetti in 2003 as the\n\nhe launched his professional music career in a big way. The Birmingham resident earned a Grammy nomination that year, had a No. 1 record, appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and became one of the most famous faces in the nation.\n\n\"I would have been so thankful to just have a record contract,\" Studdard, 35, says today. \"That’s all I actually had in the scope of my career. I didn’t think, 'I want to be a superstar.' I just wanted to have a record contract where I make records and people respect me as a musician. God’s thing for me was a lot bigger than I had ever expected for myself.\"\n\nThe R&B singer -- dubbed the Velvet Teddy Bear by none other than Gladys Knight -- has experienced some ups and downs in his life since that \"Idol\" heyday. Right now, however, Studdard seems to be on a roll, with the\n\na collection of romantic songs supervised by producer David Foster.\n\nJust as important, Studdard has a trimmed-down physique and a commitment to health and fitness, kickstarted by his\n\nOn a recent weekday, Studdard paid a visit to the Alabama Media Group headquarters in downtown Birmingham. During a wide-ranging interview, he talked about his life-changing experience on reality TV, revealed his current weight, discussed the making of \"Unconditional Love\" and detailed his plans for 2014.\n\nIn\n\n, the first of a two-part series, Studdard talked about his weight-loss campaign and reflected on his\n\njourney. In today's follow-up, the singer focuses on his entertainment agenda for the rest of this year, including biographical special on BET's\n\nand a\n\n.\n\nQ:\n\nYou'll be performing several shows with Lalah Hathaway, starting on April 5 in Detroit. How will those concerts be organized? Will you perform together or do separate sets?\n\nA:\n\nNo, it’s together. I don’t know if you had the opportunity to see the tour I did with Clay (Aiken), but our show was a more Rat Pack-ish style, variety kind of show. I think Lalah and I, our show, will be a little bit like that, but more of a Marvin Gaye-Tammi Terrell-ish kind of feel. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nLalah is one of my favorite singers of all time. If you ask 10 R&B and soul singers who their favorite singer is, they’ll probably see seven lists with her name on it. To be on tour with her, and to know how much her father has influenced me musically ... She’s great. We’ll perform together, have a full band, do some songs separately. I think it’s going to be a great show, and people will get their money’s worth. I just heard that we may get to come (to Birmingham), which is good, because I never get to come here with my tours.\n\nQ:\n\nWhich songs from \"Unconditional Love\" are going to be on your setlists?\n\nA:\n\nAs a solo artist, I have to do the “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” the Bonnie Raitt. I have to do the Boz Scaggs, “Look What You’ve Done to Me.” I have to do the Donny Hathaway, “Love, Love, Love,” and I’m trying to get Lalah to sing that with me, because it’s her dad’s song. And we’re probably going to do, “If This World Were Mine,” the song that we have together. The title track of the album? Maybe not. But “Meant to Be,” most definitely, because the tour is called the “Meant to Be” tour.\n\nQ:\n\nY\n\nou mostly worked with David Foster on the new record, but Eric Benet also has a producing credit or two. What were those sessions like?\n\nA:\n\nFirst of all, his family’s from Alabama. His mother and father are both from Mobile. I did not know that, but I learned that when I had an opportunity to meet him. I met him several times, but I never had a chance to make those connections. You know, everybody is from Alabama.\n\nHe and his production partner are really great. What makes them great is that it’s like working with me, Alvin (Garrett) and John (Jackson). If you’re ever in the studio with us. I’m a singer, so I know how to talk to singers. And they are musicians, so they know how to talk to musicians. And it works well. He knew exactly how much time to hang out with me, how much time to make sure that we learned each other’s story, and we went right into making the music. It was a great little session.\n\nWe did two songs together, “Close the Door” and “Love, Look What You’ve Done to Me.” And that song, I knew that was going to be everybody’s favorite as soon as I left the studio. As soon as I finished it, I knew: “This is going to be special.” I’ve already gotten requests from people, “Will you do that at my wedding, please?”\n\nQ:\n\nHow do you respond to that?\n\nA:\n\nI don’t do weddings. I’m just saying, though, send the right check and I will consider it.\n\nQ:\n\nNow that the record is done -- the songs are sung, the circle is closed -- how do you feel about it?\n\nA:\n\nI love it. This is what I wanted my fourth project (“Love Is”) to be, the one with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. It’s actually very close to that, but because I wasn’t on a major label, even though I was on Sony ATV, they were treating it like it was an indie project. It didn’t get the look that it should have gotten, and it was a great album. But this album, because it’s on Verve and Universal, it’s a major-label system and it’s the right fit. And I’m older now, and these songs fit me. It’s like in my pocket, like I haven’t heard myself sound consistently that good.\n\nYou listen to some artist’s albums, and it’s like, that song didn’t really fit what they were trying to do. You can kind of tell when songs are thrown on projects. And on this one, nothing was thrown on. Everything about this album was calculated. Honestly, David and I wrote letters to each other for a month-and-a-half about the song selection. So this is a really, like, an old-school process -- and when I say old school, I mean like Louis Armstrong. You know, they didn’t really talk over the phone that much. David was sending me letters, “What do you think about this song?” or “What do you think of that?” We just sat down and sang all of them. And that was cool, too.\n\nQ:\n\nMost of the songs on \"Unconditional Love\" are covers. Were any of the choices unusual for you?\n\nA:\n\nThe one song that was a surprise for me to like was the Neil Diamond song, “Hello.” If you had told me I would be singing a Neil Diamond song, I would have said, “Whatever.” But it’s beautiful.\n\nQ:\n\nYou've said that maturity, being a grown-up man, is important to you now. Does the music need to reflect that?\n\nA:\n\nEverything needs to reflect that. You’ll see in the coming year, because there’s a lot that’s going on, from my Christmas album, that’s hopefully going to be out, to a jazz project that I’m also working on, to a spirituals album. So there’s a lot going on. And it’s all synergistic. I have a new management, a new publicist ... If you want to get to a certain place, you have to put certain people around you.\n\nAnd I most definitely have a place in my mind where I see my career going. I want to be Luther, Frankie, Nat King Cole. When they think about me in 20 years, I want people to say ... you know to be completely honest, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Luther Vandross, they didn’t sell more records than the Stones, but who’s music is more timeless? So I’m really just trying to set myself up for that. I think it’s very tangible. I think there is room for me to stand on stage with Michael Buble and be on the same bill with him at Madison Square Garden, if the music is correct.\n\nQ: Do you play Ping-Pong? A musician in Michael Buble's band says he's all about that on tour. And he's very competitive.\n\nA:\n\nI’m a great Ping-Pong player. ... I will demolish him. I was the Boys & Girls Club of Central Alabama champion. Play me, Michael Buble. I love Ping-Pong.\n\nQ:\n\nCan you talk about the highs and lows of your career, how they happened?\n\nA:\n\nIt’s so weird, because I think it’s been more perception than actual truth, in that this is my sixth album in 10 years. Every year and a half, I have a new album that has come out. Good or bad or indifferent, I’ve had new music come out. In between that, I’ve had Top 10 singles, radio play, and for some reason ... What happens is if you come from a show that’s a pop-based show ... My very first single was a No. 1 single and pop song. “Flying Without Wings” debuted at No. 1 on the Pop 100.\n\nSo then you go from that, to going on a label that decides, “OK, so even if he had a No. 1 pop record, our obligation is to put him in the urban AC division.” So you instantly lose 70 percent of those people who bought that No. 1 pop record, because the record company put you in a box. That said, there was still a lot of successes in that box. “Change Me” on “The Return” was like a No. 1 record for 11 weeks. That’s not like having a No. 1 pop record, but even so ... “Sorry 2004” was also a huge hit.\n\nBut the urban AC genre is completely different from a pop situation. And when you leave a show like “American Idol,” people expect you to stay at that pop level. But that’s just what it is. There’s no sugar-coating it. When people ask you what you’re doing, it’s not because you’re not doing anything, it’s because it’s not as big as it was, or where it should be.\n\nLuckily, the record company I’m on now is not even concerned with radio. They’re concerned about the longevity of a singer’s career. And they’re about building greatness as a brand. And that’s who I need to be with. I don’t need to be with anybody that’s trying to get a Top 10 single and throw it away. I need to be with somebody who’s actually invested in me being around for another 30 years. I’m making a home with record company where I’m able to do monumental things.\n\nQ:\n\nPeople think singers have it made if they appear on a reality show like \"Idol,\" especially if they win. But when you get off the show, isn't that when the real work starts?\n\nA:\n\nNobody’s on the top of the mountaintop always, and I feel that even if you do make it on a show like that, you’ve still got to pay your dues. I think the last five or six years for me have been my dues-paying process. And I think that the blessing is that I’ve been able to stay around, that I didn’t go off silently in the night. I slowly kept pegging at it, pegging at it, until the right situation came along. My mama always told me that preparation matters, and she’s right.\n\nQ:\n\nWhat about acting? You've done a play with Robin Givens, \"Heaven I Need a Hug,\" and you played Fats Waller in a revival of \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" You seemed pretty comfortable when the national tour came to Birmingham. Will do you more of that?\n\nA:\n\nI am ready to do whatever opportunity presents itself, and do it to the best of my ability. I am most definitely not as comfortable acting as I am singing, but singing is acting.\n\nQ:\n\nYou've got a BET special coming up in mid-March, on Centric TV. What can you tell us about it?\n\nA:\n\nThey’re doing a series called\n\nwhich is going to have a documentary for each of these people. I think they’re going to have me, Dionne Warwick, Chaka Khan, maybe one of two other people. It’s kind of like VH1 “Behind the Music,” very similar, I think. It’s just an opportunity to really tell your story. ... There will be different interviews with people who had a lot to do with my career, people from J Records and Clay and ...\n\nQ:\n\nWill it be gossipy? \"Behind the Music\" had lots of juicy gossip.\n\nA:\n\nI don’t know. It might be. There might be a little gossip, I’m sure. It’s television, so ...\n\nQ:\n\nWill they be talking to people like your ex-wife, Surata Zuri McCants?\n\nA:\n\nI think she might be on there. ... That’s life. I’m sure there’s going to be some juice, but I’m cool. If it happened, it happened. You can’t go back on it now. I can’t go back in time and say, “Don’t talk about that.”\n\nQ:\n\nDid BET shoot footage of your dog? Fans have seen photos of him on Instagram.\n\nA:\n\nDid they get Buddy on camera? I don’t think they got Buddy on camera. That’s my boy. That’s my man.\n\nQ:\n\nYou've revved up your presence on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram this year. How are you using social media to connect with fans?\n\nA:\n\nThat’s just where they are now. I like it myself now ... It took me a while to get up to speed on the Twitter talk and all that stuff, and the consistency you have. But I think it’s definitely good for me, because the fans are more connected to what I’m doing. They don’t have to ask all these questions about what am I doing, because I’m always putting it out there. I make sure I wake up in the morning and I say, “Team, what are we putting out there today?” People don’t get (news) the way they used to anymore, they get up in the morning and they click on that app, and they see what’s going on. I like Instagram. I will say that I am kind of vain in that way; I do like Instagram.\n\nQ:\n\nThings have changed quite a bit since your 2003 win on \"American Idol.\" When you look back on that moment -- when the confetti was flying and you were singing \"Flying Without Wings\" -- how does that stack up as a career highlight?\n\nA:\n\nThat moment was God giving me evidence of things hoped for. ... I had been praying and believing and hoping for that moment since I was 11 years old. Maybe even before, but I knew at 11 that I wanted to be a professional. ... You have those moments that make your faith in God stronger than ever, and for me, that was that moment. That’s why, when other people see things as failure, I always see things as success. Because I know there is always something greater for me than what I have or want for myself.\n\nQ:\n\nHave you watched \"American Idol\" this year? There are three singers from our state on the show.\n\nA:\n\nI have watched one episode.\n\nQ:\n\nDo you have any advice for the Alabama contestants?\n\nA:\n\nI’m gonna be rooting for them. They’ve got a long way to go. I try not to get too upset about people from Alabama until they make the top five. People get excited, “My son’s in the top 40,” but they have miles to go before they sleep.\n\nQ:\n\nYou've talked about several projects in the works. What will the rest of this year be like for you?\n\nA:\n\nThe tour, of course, is happening from April to June. I think my album is going to be released overseas in the summer, so I’ll be over there a lot -- Asia, the UK, Europe. The Christmas album, I’ll probably have to start getting that tight around August. And it’s probably be released in the middle of November. I’m hopefully going to be working on a jazz project that I’ll be producing, with other guys from here. It will be straight-ahead jazz, but more John Coltrane-Johnny Hartman kind of stuff, probably with fresher material, just in that vein. ... I may do one or two standards. I’ve just decided that I want to do “The Way You Look Tonight.” I love that song, because I just heard Tony Bennett sing it. It’s so slick, man.\n\nQ:\n\nWhat is a typical day like for you in Birmingham? You get up, you walk the dog ...\n\nA:\n\nI get up in the morning; I have the same breakfast every day: Kashi, turkey bacon and black coffee. Then I got to St. Vincent’s One Nineteen and I work out. I just train. I do work out from time-to-time at Xtreme Fitness with Kevin Brown. He’s really great. He’s amazing. He’s called the trainer from hell. His Instagram is Trainer From Hell.\n\nAnd then I love hanging out here. I love Avondale Brewery. I don’t drink as much beer as I used to, but when I want to have a beer, I will go there. When I just want to hang out with my friends, I go to Ona’s (Music Room) and chill. Ona is just, I can always sit and talk with him for hours about music and just life in general.\n\nMy favorite restaurants here are probably Cafe Dupont and Bottega, they’re still at the top. When I was home for the BET thing, I had lunch at the Veranda, amazing. … I was like, if I eat that biscuit, it’s going to mess up how my suit’s going to look. I was going to be on camera all day, so ...\n\nQ:\n\nDid you eat the biscuit?\n\nA:\n\nI did not. I should have, because it was my cheat day. Oh, well.\n\nQ:\n\nPlenty of singers would move to New York, Los Angeles or some other major city, if they were in your position. What keeps you in Birmingham?\n\nA:\n\nPeople ask me that all the time, and I don’t really know the answer to that. I’m 35 years old, and it’s home, and I really love the people. And there’s nothing like being close to your family. People can kind of downplay that, but there’s something about being able to go see your grandmama."
