        "text": "Sophia Loren Urges Naples To Toss Trash\n\nActress Sophia Loren is imploring people to clear the garbage off the streets of Naples, Italy.\n\nAn Italian newspaper quotes her as saying that she is begging, with her \"hands clasped in prayer,\" that people multiply their efforts to remedy what she calls a tragedy. She says seeing footage of the streets of Naples and the surrounding region littered by piles of trash moves her to tears and brings anguish to her heart.\n\nSpeaking from Geneva, she urged residents to \"Cooperate!\" and \"Make an effort!\"\n\nSince December, garbage collectors stopped picking up the trash because dumps are full and residents have protested against new ones. The government has passed a series of measures to try and solve the crisis.\n\nLoren grew up just outside Naples and her family moved into the city during World War II.\n\nRuben Studdard Preps For Weekend Wedding\n\nFormer \"American Idol\" Ruben Studdard is getting ready for a weekend wedding in his home state of Alabama.\n\nStuddard, nicknamed the \"Velvet Teddy Bear\" on \"Idol\" for his big frame and sonorous voice, will marry Surata Zuri McCants, his girlfriend of two years, at the Canterbury United Methodist Church in Mountain Brook on Saturday.\n\nHe met his bride-to-be during a CD-signing at a Wal-Mart store in Atlanta in October 2006. The 29-year-old singer says he was struck by McCants' beauty and later tracked her down in the toy department and asked for her telephone number.\n\nStuddard is set to release a new album later this year.\n\nJordin Sparks: \"I'm Not Getting Married For A While\"\n\n2007's \"American Idol\" Jordin Sparks has shot down rumors that she was recently married to her \"alleged\" boyfriend, singer/model Steph Jones.\n\n\"I'm only 18 years old. I'm not getting married for a while,\" she told Jet magazine.\n\nThe interview is in the latest issue of Jet, on newsstands now.\n\nParis Hilton Makes Good On Her Post-Jail Promises\n\nParty girl Paris Hilton is a do-gooder.\n\nThe socialite made an \"extremely generous\" donation toward the construction of a medical building at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, hospital officials said Thursday, although they did not specify the amount of the gift.\n\n\"The children I have met through my involvement with Childrens Hospital have truly touched my heart,\" Hilton said in a statement. \"I am proud to make a donation and lend my name to the fundraising effort to help children who are facing terribly serious illnesses.\"\n\nThe 460,000-square-foot Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases is expected to be open in 2010.\n\nAfter spending about 23 days in jail last year for violating probation on alcohol-related reckless driving charges, Hilton told CNN's Larry King the experience prompted her to re-evaluate the role of partying in her life. She said she wanted \"to help raise money for kids and for breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.\"\n\nGeorge Clooney Calls For Unity Among Actors\n\nGeorge Clooney just wants actors to get along instead of choosing between sparring unions.\n\nHe has adopted a neutral stance in the dispute between the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n\"What we can't do is pit artist against artist,\" he wrote in a letter released Thursday.\n\nAFTRA has already reached a tentative agreement with Hollywood studios. SAG wants AFTRA members to vote against the deal, saying its approval will handcuff SAG at the bargaining table.\n\nBoth unions' current contracts are set to expire Monday, leaving Hollywood on edge about a possible replay of the 100-day writers strike that ended in February.\n\nTom Hanks, Alec Baldwin and others have joined hundreds of actors in signing an online petition urging actors to ratify the AFTRA pact. Meanwhile, Jack Nicholson, Viggo Mortensen and Holly Hunter have endorsed a SAG ad calling for AFTRA to return to the negotiating table to get a better deal.\n\nClooney called the fight counterproductive \"because the one thing you can be sure of is that stories about Jack Nicholson vs. Tom Hanks only strengthens the negotiating power\" of the studios, he said.\n\nOhio Man Accused Of Stalking Teen Singers Aly And AJ\n\nAuthorities have arrested a southeast Ohio man accused of stalking and threatening teen actress-singers Aly and AJ.\n\nLancaster police say 42-year-old Rex Mettler is charged with felony menacing by stalking. Police say he made violent threats against the Disney Channel stars, 19-year-old Alyson Michalka and her 17-year-old sister, Amanda Michalka.\n\nAly and AJ are scheduled to perform Friday night at National City Pavilion in Cincinnati.\n\nFire Guts San Diego Eatery Featured In \"Top Gun\"\n\nThe restaurant where Tom Cruise crooned to Kelly McGillis in the movie \"Top Gun\" has been gutted by a fire in San Diego.\n\nA cook at Kansas City Barbecue says the blaze started Thursday in an open cooking pit and spread quickly to the rest of the restaurant's interior.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Maurice Luque says the landmark restaurant is \"destroyed.\"\n\nBut no one was hurt and the fire was extinguished in about 20 minutes.\n\nA sign in the restaurant notes that the 1986 movie's \"sleazy bar scene\" was filmed there.\n\nLuque estimates the damage at $400,000, not including the cost of photographs and props from the film."
