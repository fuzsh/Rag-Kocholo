But I just looked at her and thought: 'She is so beautiful.'\"\n\nHe added: \"God has given me a beautiful wife. I am looking forward to having fun with her and enjoying all the blessings that have come my way so far.\"\n\nStuddard, nicknamed the 'Velvet Teddy Bear', beat Clay Aiken in the final of American Idol in 2003."
