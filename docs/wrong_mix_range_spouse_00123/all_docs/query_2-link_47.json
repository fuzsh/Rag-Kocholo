        "text": "The night before the “Greatest Two Minutes in Sports” all of Louisville was buzzing with activity.\n\nDerby Eve is traditionally one of the most active nights in Louisville with parties all over town, people out in the streets and bars open longer than usual. Louisville’s population of famous people, at least for the next 2 days, skyrockets as celebrities descend on Derby City in their Lear Jets and stretch limousines.\n\nPersonally, I don’t get too excited when I see someone famous coming down the red carpet. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still exciting, but as long as I don’t get a one-on-one with a celebrity it won’t get me too excited. Now, the time I ran into Lenny Kravitz in South Beach Miami or the time I was able to meet Willie Nelson on his tour bus – THAT was a different story!\n\nFriday night I photographed the Julep Ball at the Galt House for the Courier-Journal. The Julep Ball is a star-studded event that benefits the James Graham Brown Cancer Center. For a seat among celebrities, to dine on gourmet food served on silver plates and to dance to top-notch musical acts one has to pay $500 per person. But it’s for a good cause.\n\nHere are some of my pictures:\n\nIt was fun, but as soon as I transmitted from site, I hurried back home to rest up for Derby."
