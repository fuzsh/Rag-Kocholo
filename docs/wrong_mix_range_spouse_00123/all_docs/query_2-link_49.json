        "text": "This morning I learned that 53 year old grouch Simon Cowell, X Factor judge and former American Idol judge, is going to be a father. And that’s not the best part. The mother of his child is his friend Andrew Silverman’s estranged wife, Lauren Silverman. Yes. You read correctly. Simon Cowell got his friend’s wife…\n\nAmanda Bynes has graduated from calling people ugly and throwing bongs out of windows. She is now an arsonist. Amanda Bynes is being detained for setting an elderly woman’s driveway on fire in a Thousand Oaks, California retirement community. A neighbor saw what was going on and called the cops. Bynes was spotted with a…\n\nThe wait is over. ABC Family has decided to cancel Amy Sherman-Palladino’s Bunheads. I cannot believe that after being in limbo for five months they’ve decided to drop the series. With all the new shows being added to the lineup on the network, there really isn’t a spot for Bunheads. ABC Family has chosen to pick…\n\nIt’s been five episodes and I am most definitely hooked! Last nights episode of Devious Maids titled “Taking Out the Trash” was full of drama. Between hitting people over the head with prosthetic legs and catfights with Remi’s high school ex-girlfriend, I could not help but stare at the screen with my jaw dropped as…\n\nIn last night’s Pretty Little Liars episode titled “Under the Gun,” viewers get a sneak peek at Ravenswood, the town where the spinoff series of the same name is to take place. Ravenswood is set to air this October on ABC Family, and boy does it look creepy. As soon as Spencer Hastings and Toby…\n\nI still can’t get over the shock. This morning I was mindlessly scrolling through my Instagram feed when I stopped on a collage of photos from peoplemag. The photos were of Glee star Cory Monteith. I read the description to learn that they were posted in memory of him. What? Cory Monteith is no longer with…\n\nWhat’s life without a little bit of leaked music, eh? Yesterday, Selena Gomez’s song “Love Will Remember”, which will be released on the Stars Dance album on July 23rd, got leaked. She doesn’t seem that upset about it either. She embraced it, posting a video to her YouTube sending fans to the song via Soundcloud…\n\nNow that the Fourth of July festivities are over, and I can actually stay awake long enough to edit pics and video, here’s a glimpse of how I spent my holiday. Yup. I hit the beach with my friends Kristell, Gina, and Niketa for Independence Day!! Rockaway Beach is located in Far Rockaway. It’s not…\n\nToday marks the 237th birthday of the United States. It’s time to celebrate! We’ve come a long way since 1776. It’s a shame though, that the founding fathers didn’t have a soundtrack to go along with their signing of the Declaration of Independence. Or did they? In any case, here a few patriotic songs to…\n\nJust a few months ago, a few college friends and I were commenting on the fact that Ruben Studdard basically disappeared from the Hollywood scene after his one hit “Sorry for 2004.” That song is so old I don’t even remember the lyrics that well. So much for winning American Idol in 2003. Apparently Ruben…"
