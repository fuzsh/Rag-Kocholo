        "text": "The Velvet Teddy Bear, whose full name is actually Christopher Ruben Studdard, met his bride in 2006 at an in-store record signing event at an Atlanta-area Wal-Mart.\n\n\"I was signing copies of my CD and she came in to get one signed for her friend who couldn't get off from work,\" Ruben told The Birmingham News. \"We started talking, and she was telling me about her friend. But I just looked at her and thought, `She is so beautiful.'\""
