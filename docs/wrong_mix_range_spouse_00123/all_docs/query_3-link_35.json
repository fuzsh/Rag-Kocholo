These admirers somehow made the leap from being a face in the crowd to a red carpet plus one for their favorite star. And while it’s certainly not a common occurrence, there definitely are celebs who have totally fallen for a fan.\n\nConan O’Brien found his future wife in the audience of one of his shows and Liam Payne first met one of his past girlfriends when she attended a meet and greet. Although it may not be the most traditional way for a celeb to meet their significant other, it’s probably nice to know that they’ll always be your biggest fan!\n\nRead on to find out which stars have dated fans...\n\nGetty\n\n14 Celebs Who Graduated With Surprising College Degrees\n\nView Story\n\n1. Jake T. Austin\n\nJake T. Austin made fangirl dreams come true when he started dating Danielle Ceasar in 2016, over five years after she had reached out to him on social media. In addition to years of tweeting professions of love to the actor, Danielle also attended one of Jake’s meet and greets in 2011. He followed her on social media not long after. It’s unclear how the duo moved from social media friends to an IRL couple but Jake says it doesn’t matter how they originally met.\n\n\"We're young and having fun just getting to know each other. It doesn't matter how you meet someone — on set, in a coffee shop, at school, or in the business. Sometimes you connect with people at the right moment and you just click,” Jake said in a statement.\n\nThe couple unfortunately quietly called it quits after several years of dating.\n\nTBS\n\nConan Says Goodbye to Late-Night -- Plus, Homer Simpson's Exit Interview and Jack Black's Epic Farewell Song\n\nView Story\n\n2. Conan O’Brien\n\nConan O’Brien met his future wife Liza Powell while she was a fan attending a taping of his show back in 2000. He says he was captivated by the fact that she was “incredibly beautiful” and he almost “instantly” fell in love with her.\n\n“I did know very quickly. It was being shot for television so somewhere, in the vault at NBC, there's footage of me literally falling for my wife on camera...She’s incredibly beautiful so that was the first attention-getter,” Conan told Piers Morgan.\n\nFollowing their initial meeting, he got to know her through phone calls, learning that she was “very intelligent, funny, and a very good person.” They tied the knot in 2002.\n\nTBS\n\nConan O'Brien Burns Up His Last Week on TBS By Smoking Weed with Seth Rogen\n\nView Story\n\n3. Billie Joe Armstrong\n\nGreen Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong met his wife Adrienne Nesser at one of the band’s first concerts in 1990. Afterwards, they corresponded by phone to get to know each other and Billie Joe even routed a tour through Minneapolis so he could see her again. She eventually inspired many Green Day songs, including “2000 Light Years Away.”\n\n“The first tour that Green Day ever went on, I met my wife, Adrienne, at a house party in Minneapolis. She asked for an address because we had run out of our vinyl. Then we started corresponding and kind of became pen pals, and having these long talks, running up phone bills. Then Green Day booked this mini-tour. We drove from California all the way out to Minnesota. Nobody really knew why we were driving all the way to Wisconsin and Minnesota to just play, like, four shows, but I was really just going back to see her,” Billie Joe told Rolling Stone.\n\nYouTube/Instagram\n\nDixie D'Amelio and Bryce Hall Show Support For Addison Rae's New Song\n\nView Story\n\n4.

The duo kept their relationship quiet for almost a year and finally made things official in 2019. In 2020, the couple got engaged. Although it’s not clear how Maya moved from a fan to a fiancée, the couple were clearly very happy together until their split in 2021.\n\n“I feel like more than anything at this point, I’m more disappointed in myself that I keep on hurting people. That annoys me. I’ve just not been very good at relationships. And I know what my pattern of things is with relationships at this point. I’m just not very good at them so I just need to work on myself before I put myself on to somebody else I just wasn’t giving a very good version of me anymore, that I didn’t appreciate and I didn’t like being,” Liam said on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast following their split.\n\nInstagram\n\n31 Famous Couples Who Got Engaged in 2020\n\nView Story\n\n5.

Henson\n\nWhile talking about the difficulties of dating as an actress, Taraji P. Henson admits she once went out with a fan who ended up being too starstruck to pursue something serious with her.\n\n“Hard to maneuver when you’re in show business. It shrinks the search pool. I don’t want an actor. I want a life partner. A real one. I had a guy, but cut to the chase. He was starstruck. They fall for the lady on-screen,” Taraji told Page Six.\n\nGetty\n\nA-List Actors Dish On Their Audition Nightmares\n\nView Story\n\n7.

Kelly once admitted that when she was just 16, she saw a movie poster for “Grease” and professed that she was going to marry John. The duo met a decade later and tied the knot a few years after.\n\n\"I did have sort of a flash. I came out of a film, saw the poster for Grease and I knew I'd be with him. I just knew. I was about 16 years old. I really knew it and it turned into, 'I'm going to marry that man,' and so he likes to tease me that I walked out and said, 'I'm going to marry that man,' and then did, ultimately,\" reportedly said.\n\nGetty\n\n11 Celebrity Summer Flings That Made Heat Waves in Hollywood\n\nView Story\n\n8.

He says he once even went to the movies with a fan and they made out the entire time.\n\n“Yes, I’ve dated fans. I can’t say that I’ve never put a foot in that world...I remember I invited a fan to a movie, and we just made out the entire time. I don’t even remember what the movie was about. I must have been 16 or so. Afterward, I was kind of freaking out, because I thought she’d go public and the whole world would find out. Luckily, she never did, I think because she assumed there’d be another meet-up down the road,” Joe wrote in Vulture.\n\nInstagram\n\nNick Jonas Surprises Fan Wearing a Jonas Brothers Shirt\n\nView Story\n\n9.
