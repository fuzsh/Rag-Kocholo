We haven’t talked about this guy in a while and we wish we were bringing up his name with better news, but unfortunately we’re not.

Season 2 American Idol winner Ruben Studdard and his wife are divorcing.

He filed the papers in Alabama this week and cited “irreconcilable differences.”

Studdard married Surata Zuri McCants in 2008, but his rep told sources that they “have gone their separate ways.├óΓé¼┬¥

It sounds like it was for the best and with no kids, it shouldn’t be too messy of a divorce.

Sorry to hear that things didn’t work out, guys! We wish them both the best of luck as they move on with their lives.
