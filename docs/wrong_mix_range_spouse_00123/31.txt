Ruben Studdard and his fiancée Surata Zuri McCants were married in a suburb outside of his hometown of Birmingham, Ala. on Saturday.

According to the Birmingham News, the church ceremony lasted about 30 minutes and included prayers and music provided by a string ensemble.

The groom, nicknamed the “Velvet Teddy Bear” during his victorious run on season two of “American Idol,” wore a black tuxedo with a white bow tie for Saturday’s ceremony. His bride wore a white and ivory wedding gown.

The couple will lay down roots in Alabama as the 29-year-old-singer gets set to release a new album later this year.
