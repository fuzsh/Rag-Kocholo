Is she still a gold digger if she and Russell had that plan TOGETHER: get married, give him some babies, have a piece of his hip hop/fashion empire and then go their own separate ways?

Probably not. She was legit without Russell. However, if that was their plan, then both of them were stupid.

In your eyes. People get married for other reasons than love all the time.

Neither one of them seem bitter about their divorce and have moved on. From the outside looking in, it does look like their marriage was just an arrangement that both benefitted from.

Maybe so.

I do know she's running a multi-million dollar fashion empire with a lot of control as creative director.
