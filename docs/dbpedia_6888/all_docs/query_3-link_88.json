        "text": "A charismatic bandleader and an unbridled whirlwind of sexual energy formed one of the most formidable live acts in history.\n\nIke and Tina Turner were such a presence onstage that even their own albums don’t do them justice. The explosive duo made such enduring hits as “River Deep-Mountain High,” “Proud Mary” and “Nutbush City Limits.”\n\nIke and Tina Turner’s story is really one about the blues.\n\nThe blues were in the way they lived— a life that mirrored the rough-and-tumble songs they played like “Stagger Lee” and “A Fool In Love,” a life of never-ending one-night stands, frustrating brushes with serious fame and fortune, and a stormy relationship that did not (in the words of one of their most popular numbers) work out fine."
