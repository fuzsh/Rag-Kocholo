In a recent announcement from Rolling Stone magazine, he was ranked 148th in the \"250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,\" highlighting his undeniable talent as a guitarist. His 1st album \"Rock The Blues,\" recorded in the 1950s and released on Crown Records in 1963, serves as proof of his exceptional skills and originality as a guitarist.
