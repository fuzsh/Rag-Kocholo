        "text": "Dynamite!\n\nIke Turner's Recorded Legacy\n\nFred Rothwell\n\nPianist, guitarist, bandleader, composer, arranger, record producer, talent scout, mentor, studio proprietor, label owner and all round hustler, Ike Turner was a musical powerhouse who helped shape the course of popular music in the twentieth century and beyond.\n\nBest known as the creative genius behind the Ike & Tina Turner phenomenon, he enjoyed a lengthy career that kicked off in 1951 with the seminal 'Rocket 88' and continued until his death in 2007.\n\nIn this scholarly work, Fred Rothwell examines in detail the rich legacy of the hundreds of recordings Turner left behind, ranging from blues and soul to gospel, rock and funk, while at the same time charting the various twists and turns in his often turbulent personal life.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"I very much doubt there'll ever be another look at [Ike Turner's] creative work in as much depth as Dynamite! All told, the book chronicles 389 recording sessions - both in studio and live settings - offering a description of each title recorded, details of the origins of songs, background stuff on musicians/vocalists, and so forth. If you just have the slightest interest in his music but want to know more, this is what you need.\" Now Dig This\n\n\"The work that has gone into the subject is breathtaking and I found much that intrigued, even when dipping into the later sessions, and plenty of reasons to explore the music that the book describes, most of which I was unfamiliar with... A necessary purchase for both discographers and fans alike, I'd say!\" Blues & Rhythm\n\n\"Anybody who has the merest interest in black music should not overlook this great read.\" Tales From The Woods\n\n\"This is a discography you can actually sit down and read... The depth of the discographical work itself is stunning, given that Ike would record seemingly constantly. Dynamite! is a true labour of love and a very handsome looking one too.\" Blues In Britain\n\n\"Ike Turner gave us some of the finest and most lasting R&B of all time, most of it as thrilling now as it was when it was first conceived. That is the essence of the Ike Turner story, and it's what this book celebrates with majesty and grace.\" Living Blues"
