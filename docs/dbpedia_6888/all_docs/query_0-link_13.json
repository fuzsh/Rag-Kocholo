        "text": "Ike Turner – Risin’ With The Blues\n\nThere is no denying Ike Turner’s place in musical history. While the general public may know about his heyday with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue during the ’60s, only hardcore Ike fans and jump blues enthusiasts are aware of him spearheading the formative years of rock ‘n’ roll with the 1951 hit ‘Rocket 88’, his A&R work for the Chess label and early participation on recordings by B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters.\n\nAfter the break-up with Tina, drug abuse, notoriety and self-imposed exile led to a career black hole until his re-emergence with the critically acclaimed 2001 album Here And Now, which earned him a deserved Grammy nomination.\n\nOn ‘Risin’ with the Blues’, the R&B icon and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer takes the intensity level up a notch or two with typically slashing-stinging guitar work, rollicking Boogie Woogie piano flourishes and some of the nastiest, rawest, most potent vocals he’s ever summoned up in a fabled career that dates back more than 50 years."
