Ike Turner, a guitarist, pianist, band leader, producer, talent scout... With his diverse talents, he excelled in many fields. In a recent announcement from Rolling Stone magazine, he was ranked 148th in the "250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time," highlighting his undeniable talent as a guitarist. His 1st album "Rock The Blues," recorded in the 1950s and released on Crown Records in 1963, serves as proof of his exceptional skills and originality as a guitarist. P-VINE is delightfully reissuing the important album on Japanese edition vinyl with Obi-strip for the first time.
