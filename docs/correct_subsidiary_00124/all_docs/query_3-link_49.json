May 8, 2001 - Winchester Systems has introduced its ultra-high performance FlashSSD (Solid State Disk) product to complement its family of high performance FlashDisk OpenRAID enterprise storage products.\n\nFlashSSD is a non-volatile solid-state disk product that reliably delivers a sustained and constant 12,000 I/O operations per second and 40 MB per second data throughput. This data rate is consistent for all types of I/O including all reads and writes, all sequential and random transactions and for all large and small block transfers. It is ideal for the typical 1% to 5% of an application's \"hot files\" that account for 50% or more of all disk requests. By moving a relatively small percentage of these hot files to FlashSSD, disk intensive applications including OLTP, database, e-mail, messaging, e-commerce, streaming video, downloads, financial and manufacturing immediately run 100% to 500% faster with no tuning whatsoever. FlashSSD provides an I/O measurement tool for Oracle database users that pinpoints Oracle's hot files.\n\n\"Winchester Systems now offers a variety of SAN-capable, high performance enterprise storage products that can be \"mixed-and-matched\" to each application to provide the highest possible performance and the highest return on investment for all mission critical applications,\" according to Mr. Joel Leider, the company's chief executive officer.\" ...Winchester Systems profile\n\nSee also:- Solid state disks\n\nWind River Launches Integrated Network Acceleration\n\nNetworld + Interop Conference, Las Vegas, Nev.,  May 8, 2001 - Wind River Systems, Inc. today announced beta availability of Tornado® for Intelligent Network Acceleration (TINA), the industry´s first integrated software platform for the fast-growing LAN and storage networking markets.\n\nUsing TINA, OEMs can deliver dramatic performance improvements in their server and storage devices. By offloading network traffic to an intelligent network interface card (iNIC), TINA increases throughput rates in servers, and brings high performance to SANs migrating from Fibre Channel to IP and Ethernet environments.\n\nNetworking speeds have been increasing by a factor of 10 every 2 years, outpacing improvements in microprocessor performance. With Gigabit Ethernet becoming common throughout the Internet infrastructure, server and storage devices have been greatly impacted by this increase. As they struggle to keep up with network demand, application performance steadily erodes, to the dismay of IT professionals charged with maintaining productive systems. TINA offers a solution to this dilemma by introducing a specialized architecture that offloads network processing to an intelligent network interface.\n\n\"Today´s server and storage products grind to a halt at Gigabit speeds, and 10 Gigabit is right around the corner,\" said Dave Fraser, vice president and general manager of Wind River´s Networks business unit. The most common approach for dealing with this challenge is to purchase additional, more powerful servers, an extremely expensive solution that will only be exacerbated by current trends. In addition, IT departments will often buy multiple NICs per server, which quickly erodes application performance as the host CPU spends all of its cycles processing network requests. \"By offloading the TCP/IP stack with the TINA solution onto an intelligent NIC, servers are able to meet networking performance demands while sparing precious CPU cycles for applications, all in a very cost efficient manner,\" added Fraser. \"Laboratory tests by Wind River have yielded Performance Efficiency Index results of twice that of currently available solutions using traditional NICs.\"\n\nTINA is also an ideal solution for the SAN market where high performance networking at Gigabit speeds is a necessity. In particular, TINA enables more cost effective and interoperable IP and Ethernet technology to replace the current Fibre Channel transport in the data center. Additionally, TINA is an ideal platform for emerging IP-based storage technologies such as iSCSI. ...Wind River Systems profile\n\nINRANGE Acquires ONEX Inc\n\nLUMBERTON, NJ, MAY 8, 2001 - INRANGE Technologies (Nasdaq: INRG) announced today it has acquired ONEX, Incorporated (Indianapolis), a technology consulting company whose services include designing mission-critical network infrastructures and implementing e-Business and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions.\n\nThis acquisition increases INRANGE's global direct sales and service organization to over 625 professionals, bolstering the company's capability to address this issue and to tailor technology solutions for its customers, assisting them in the design, deployment, and management of key IT initiatives such as SANs.

Because at its heart it is SRDF, the new solution moves data in any form from where it is created to where it can generate maximum business value, regardless of server platform, operating system, database or application. SRDF-DM provides customers with a single solution for all their data mobility requirements, eliminating the need for multiple DM applications, reducing training time, and enhancing user productivity.\n\n\"Data that was in one place last week, last month, or last year may not be in the optimal position today,\" said Chuck Hollis, EMC's Director of Product Marketing. \"Information delivers maximum business value when it is in motion and being accessed, delivered, re-purposed and shared anywhere across the enterprise and beyond. SRDF-DM leverages SRDF's six-year, 9,000-license track record, offering customers a cost-effective, special-purpose software tool for addressing their most business-critical data mobility challenges.\"\n\nSRDF/DM uses SRDF's patented Adaptive Copy mode to transfer data between multiple Symmetrix enterprise storage systems at high speed using public and private networks. By allowing a specified time lag between the source and target volumes, Adaptive Copy enables applications using that volume to avoid propagation delays while data is being transferred to the remote site. This feature is particularly useful in applications that transfer large amounts of data rapidly, such as migrating data centers or distributing Web content from the core of the enterprise to its edge.\n\nSRDF-DM moves storage data originating from any server platform, any operating system, locally within a SAN or remotely through a WAN while the data is current. Because SRDF is a Symmetrix-based solution, it can be used with some 250 server models, 40 operating systems, 50 cluster configurations, and all the leading database systems. ...EMC profile\n\nInfineon and Saifun Semiconductors Announce Joint Venture To Develop NROM\n\nMunich, Germany / Netanya, Israel - May 8, 2001 - Infineon Technologies AG and Saifun Semiconductors Ltd. today announced that they have established a joint venture, named Ingentix.\n\nThe new company will develop, manufacture and market flash memory products based on Saifun's patented Nitrided Read Only Memory (NROM) technology.
