        "text": "C-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS INTRODUCES MULTILYNX FOR CABLE MODEMS.\n\nC-Cube Microsystems Inc. (NASDAQ:CUBE) has introduced the MultiLynx family of integrated cable front-end chips, the first devices designed to support all major world cable standards. The two MultiLynx ICs (CL2151 and CL2161), now sampling for cable set-top boxes and cable modems, make it possible for manufacturers to design a single product capable of being deployed on 2-way broadband cable networks anywhere in the world.\n\n\"The MultiLynx family builds on C-Cube's significant experience in broadband communications to supply precisely what the industry needs to support its rapid expansion,\" said Umesh Padval, president and CEO of C-Cube Microsystems. \"This furthers our commitment to build upon our base as the world's leading supplier of digital video products to become a complete silicon solutions provider for the networked digital home.\"\n\nThe C-Cube MultiLynx CL2161 enables 2-way communications using DOCSIS, EuroDOCSIS and DVB in-band cable modem standards. It integrates a QAM demodulator with an analog-to-digital converter for the downstream channel, and a QAM/QPSK modulator with a digital-to-analog converter for the return channel. An integrated communications processor and dedicated Media Access Controller (MAC) provide support for all leading cable network standards. The communications processor also acts as the host CPU and includes DSP extensions to support Voice-over-IP (VoIP) codec algorithms simultaneously. The part connects directly to Subscriber Line Interface Circuits (SLICs) to complete a VoIP implementation.\n\nThe MultiLynx CL2151 is the first cable-modem chip designed specifically for set-top boxes. It is similar to the CL2161, but adds a second QAM demodulator for simultaneous digital video and data transfer. In addition to the protocols supported by the CL2161, the CL2151 supports DAVIC, DVS-178, Starvue and DVS-167 set-top MAC protocols. It provides direct connection to a POD (point of deployment) module for OpenCable set-top designs, and includes interfaces for easy integration with various CPUs including PCI, PowerPC and SH4. When combined with C-Cube's AViA-9600 set-top box decoder, the CL2151 enables the design of a cable set-top box with 2-way communications, voice-over-IP, home networking, and personal video recording with a minimal bill-of-materials cost.\n\nAbout C-Cube\n\nThe company is a provider of digital media processing and is leading the way with new communication processors and networked consumer products. With a focus on DVD, set-top boxes and codec-enabled products, C-Cube is driving the technology for the \"networked digital home.\"\n\nC-Cube is headquartered in Milpitas, Calif., and has offices in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nC-Cube can be found on the World Wide Web at www.c-cube.com.\n\nFor more information, call 408/490-8707."
