        "text": "Our co-founder Vanessa, experienced the challenges and uncertainties of caring for a family member with cancer firsthand – she was overwhelmed by her mother’s cancer diagnosis despite her 20-year career in biotech oncology.\n\nVanessa and the team believed that one-to-one guidance, augmented by technology, could transform cancer care. Vanessa and the Navvisa founders assembled a team invested in the mission of providing personalized cancer navigation services to patients and caregivers.\n\nReceiving a cancer diagnosis is like waking up in a foreign land\n\nwithout maps, guidebooks, or knowledge of the language.\n\nWe think of our guidance as providing the\n\nNavgational map and Visa passport for the journey."
