If you are a shareholder of record, you also may view these materials at http://www.envisionreports.com/AMBA. In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Notice of Internet Availability has been sent to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners as of the record date, April 13, 2020. The Notice of Internet Availability includes information on how to access the proxy materials, how to submit your vote via the Internet and how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials. By accessing the proxy materials on the Internet or choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email, you will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our annual meeting of shareholders on the environment.\n\n1\n\nAppointment of Proxy Holders\n\nThe Board asks you to appoint Feng-Ming (Fermi) Wang, Kevin C. Eichler and Michael Morehead as your proxy holders to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. You make this appointment by voting your shares by proxy, as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability.\n\nIf appointed by you, the proxy holders will vote your shares as you direct on the matters described in this Proxy Statement. In the absence of your direction, they will vote your shares as recommended by the Board.\n\nUnless you otherwise indicate, you also authorize your proxy holders to vote your shares on any matters not known by the Board at the time this Proxy Statement was made available to shareholders and which may be properly presented for action at the Annual Meeting.\n\nWho Can Vote\n\nOnly shareholders of record at the close of business on April 13, 2020 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On this record date, there were 34,339,388 ordinary shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Each holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote for each share held as of April 13, 2020. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors.\n\nShareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name\n\nIf on April 13, 2020, your shares were registered directly in your name with Ambarellas transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote your shares by proxy over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability to ensure your vote is counted.\n\nBeneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank\n\nIf on April 13, 2020, your shares were held not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and the Proxy Statement is being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.\n\nHow You Can Vote\n\nYou may either vote For the nominees for Class II Director or you may Withhold your vote for the nominees. For each of the other matters to be voted on, you may vote For or Against or abstain from voting.\n\nThe procedures for voting are as follows:\n\nShareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name\n\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.\n\n2\n\nBeneficial owners of shares held in street name must contact their broker, bank or other agent to revoke any prior voting instructions.\n\nRequired Vote\n\nDirectors are elected by a plurality vote, which means that the three (3) nominees for Class II director receiving the most affirmative votes will be elected. All other matters submitted for shareholder approval, including the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, require the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote.\n\nA quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid Annual Meeting. A quorum will be present if shareholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy. On the record date, there were 34,339,388 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. As a result, shareholders holding at least 17,169,695 shares will need to be present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or if you attend the Annual Meeting in person. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, then either the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of shares present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting to another date.\n\nAbstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote on that matter and have the same effect as a vote against such matter.\n\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker, in its discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on routine matters. Only Proposal 2 (ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 3 (approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation) are not considered routine matters, and without your instruction, your broker cannot vote your shares as to those proposals. If your broker returns a proxy but does not vote your shares, this results in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. However, as brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 1 or Proposal 3, broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast on Proposal 1 or Proposal 3.\n\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately count: with respect to the election of the director, For and Withhold votes and, with respect to other proposals, votes For and Against, abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Abstentions will be counted towards the vote total for Proposal 2, and will have the same effect as Against votes. Broker non-votes, although counted toward the quorum requirement, will not be counted towards the vote total for any proposal.\n\nOther Matters Brought Before the Meeting\n\nThe Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.\n\nSolicitation of Proxies\n\nThe Company will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, the Companys directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. The Company also may reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.\n\n4\n\nPROPOSAL 1\n\nELECTION OF CLASS II DIRECTORS\n\nAmbarellas Board of Directors, or the Board, currently has eight (8) members. The authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the Board and the Board intends to increase the authorized number of directors to nine (9) members prior to the Annual Meeting. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors even if less than a quorum, unless the Board determines that the vacancies shall be filled by the shareholders. A director elected to fill a vacancy in a class, including vacancies created by an increase in the number of directors, shall serve for the remainder of the full term of that class and until the directors successor is duly elected and qualified.\n\nThe Board is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, which serve staggered three-year terms:\n\nThe Board, upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, has selected Mr. Kohn, Mr. Richardson and Ms. Schwarting as nominees for election as Class II directors at the upcoming Annual Meeting. Ms. Schwarting is not currently a member of the Board and is standing for election for the first time. The proxies given to the proxy holders will be voted or not voted as directed and, if no direction is given, will be voted FOR each of the three (3) nominees. If any nominee is unable or declines to serve as director at the time of the Annual Meeting, an event not now anticipated, proxies will be voted for any nominee designated by the Board to fill the vacancy. The three (3) nominees for Class II director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected as Class II directors and will serve until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2023 or until their successors are elected and qualified.\n\nThe names of the nominees for election as Class II directors, who have been nominated by the Board, and the names of the continuing directors not up for election at the Annual Meeting, along with certain biographical information about the nominees and continuing directors, including the directors business experience, public company director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings (if applicable), and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the nominating and corporate governance committee to recommend that the director should continue to serve on the Board, are set forth below.\n\n(1)\n\nMember of Audit Committee\n\n(2)\n\nMember of Compensation Committee\n\n(3)\n\nMember of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nLeslie Kohn has served as our Chief Technology Officer and a member of our Board since he co-founded Ambarella in January 2004.

Based on the review and recommendation by the nominating and corporate governance committee, the Board has determined that Hsiao-Wuen Hon, Chenming Hu, Teresa Meng, Christopher Paisley, Jeffrey Richardson, and Andrew Verhalen, representing a majority of our directors, are independent directors under the rules of NASDAQ. The Board has also determined that Elizabeth Schwarting, director nominee, would be an independent director under the rules of NASDAQ. In making these determinations, the Board found that none of these directors or nominees for director had a material or other disqualifying relationship with Ambarella that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Feng-Ming (Fermi) Wang, Ambarellas Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Leslie Kohn, Ambarellas Chief Technology Officer, are not independent directors by virtue of their employment with Ambarella.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nThe Board is currently chaired by Dr. Wang, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Ambarella. We believe that combining the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman helps to ensure that the Board and management act with a common purpose. In our view, separating the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman has the potential to give rise to divided leadership, which could interfere with good decision-making or weaken our ability to develop and implement strategy. Instead, we believe that combining the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman provides a single, clear chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans. In addition, we believe that a combined Chief Executive Officer and Chairman is better positioned to act as a bridge between management and the Board, facilitating the regular flow of information.\n\nThe Board determined as part of our corporate governance principles that one of our independent directors should serve as a lead director at any time when the title of chairman is held by an employee director or there is no current chairman. The lead independent director presides over periodic meetings of our independent directors, has the responsibility of raising issues with management on behalf of the outside directors when appropriate and oversees the function of the Board and committees, among other responsibilities. Mr. Verhalen has served as our lead independent director since June 2017. The Board has determined that Mr. Verhalen qualifies as an independent director under the rules of NASDAQ.\n\nWe believe that the current leadership structure of the Board is appropriate at the present time and allows the Board to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently based on our current needs.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nWe have established an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Each of the committees has authority to engage legal counsel or other experts or consultants, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Board has determined that each member\n\n10\n\nEach member of the compensation committee is a non-employee director, as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and an outside director, as defined pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee is currently composed of three directors: Mr. Paisley, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Verhalen, who currently serves as the chairman of the committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee met three times during fiscal year 2020.\n\nThe responsibilities of our nominating and corporate governance committee include:\n\n\n\nreviewing and evaluating incumbent directors;\n\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\n\nOne of the key functions of the Board is informed oversight of our risk management process. The Board does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board as a whole, as well as through its standing committees that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, the Board is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure. Our audit committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The audit committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our external audit function. Our nominating and corporate governance committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines. Our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nDuring fiscal year 2020, Dr. Hon, Dr. Hu, Dr. Meng, and Mr. Richardson served as members of the compensation committee. None of the members of our compensation committee is or has in the past served as an officer or employee of the Company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the Board or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on the Board or compensation committee.\n\n12\n\nEvaluation of Board and Director Performance\n\nThe Board believes that a regular evaluation process is an essential component of strong corporate governance practices. The nominating and corporate governance committee oversees an evaluation process to evaluate Board effectiveness and aid in succession planning. This process consists of a full Board evaluation as well as evaluations of each of the Boards standing committees. The evaluations, which are distributed and obtained through outside counsel to promote candidness, seek feedback on Board and committee performance, chairman performance, processes, effectiveness, and opportunities for improvement. The questionnaires are designed to solicit feedback on a range of topics, including overall Board and committee dynamics, leadership, meeting agenda topics, information flow and access to management, director preparation and participation, and succession planning. The results of the evaluations are reviewed and discussed with the Board and its committees.\n\nIn addition to the Board and committee evaluation process, in fiscal year 2020 the nominating and corporate governance committee conducted a skill set survey of the current Board members. This survey solicited feedback on areas such as public board experience, relevant industry experience, market sector experience, and technical skills, including technology, accounting/finance, marketing/sales, public relations, strategy development, mergers and acquisitions, human resource management, and risk management and governance. The Board used the survey responses to evaluate the experience and expertise of the existing Board members and to identify the skills and characteristics of future director candidates, including Ms. Schwarting.\n\nDirector Nominations\n\nThe Board nominates directors for election at each annual meeting of shareholders and elects new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. The nominating and corporate governance committee has the responsibility to identify, evaluate, recruit and recommend qualified candidates to the Board for nomination or election.\n\nDirector Criteria. The nominating and corporate governance committee has a policy regarding consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews suggestions for director candidates recommended by shareholders and considers such candidates for recommendation based upon an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience and capability. In addition to considering an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience and capability, the Board has as an objective that its membership be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Except as may be required by rules promulgated by Nasdaq or the SEC, there are currently no specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by each candidate for the Board, nor are there any specific qualities or skills that are necessary for one or more of the members of the Board to possess. The nominating and corporate governance committee selects candidates for director based on their character, judgment, diversity of experience, independence, corporate experience, length of service, potential conflicts of interest, and their willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties as a director.\n\nPrior to each annual meeting of shareholders, the nominating and corporate governance committee will identify nominees first by reviewing the current directors whose term expires at the annual meeting of shareholders and who are willing to continue in service. These candidates are evaluated based on the criteria described above, including as demonstrated by the candidates prior service as a director, and the needs of the Board with respect to the particular talents and experience of its directors. In the event that a director does not wish to continue in service, the nominating and corporate governance committee determines not to nominate the director, or a vacancy is created on the Board as a result of a resignation, an increase in the size of the Board or other event, the nominating and corporate governance committee will consider various candidates for Board membership, including those suggested by members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, by other members of the Board, by any executive search firm engaged by the nominating and corporate governance committee and by shareholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee retained an executive\n\n13\n\nsearch firm to assist in sourcing potential candidates for our Board, including Ms. Schwarting. Upon review of Ms. Schwartings skills and characteristics, including an evaluation of the criteria described above, the nominating and corporate governance committee recommended Ms. Schwarting to the Board for selection as a nominee.\n\nShareholder Nominees. In addition, our articles of association contain provisions that address the process by which a shareholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board at our annual meeting of shareholders. In order to nominate a candidate for director, a shareholder must give timely notice in writing to Ambarella, Inc.s Secretary and otherwise comply with the provisions of our articles of association. To be timely, we must have received the shareholders notice not more than 120 days nor less than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the date our proxy statement was provided to shareholders in connection with previous years annual meeting of shareholders. However, if we did not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in the prior year or if the date of the annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the prior years annual meeting of shareholders, we must receive the shareholders notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of 90 days prior to the annual meeting of shareholders and the 10th day after the day we provided such public disclosure of the meeting date. Information required by the articles of association to be in the notice include the name and contact information for the candidate and the person making the nomination, the principal occupation or employment of the candidate, the class and number of Ambarella securities held by the candidate, and other information about the nominee that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations under that Section. We received no director nominees from our shareholders for the upcoming Annual Meeting. Shareholder nominations must be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in, and include the information required by, our articles of association and must be addressed to 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: Secretary. You can obtain a copy of our articles of association by writing to the Secretary at this address.\n\nCommunications with the Board\n\nThe Board has adopted a formal process by which shareholders may communicate with the Board or any of its directors. Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board or an individual director may send a written communication addressed as follows: Ambarella Board Communication, 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, California 95054. Each communication will be reviewed by the General Counsel of Ambarella who will forward the communication to the Board or to any individual director to whom the communication is addressed unless the communication is of a commercial, frivolous or similarly inappropriate nature, in which case, the General Counsel will discard the communication.\n\nCorporate Governance Principles and Practices\n\nWe believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder. In addition, we believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market.\n\nThe Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to each of our directors, officers and employees. This code addresses various topics, including:\n\n\n\nconflicts of interest;\n\n\n\ninsider trading;\n\n\n\ncorporate opportunities;\n\n\n\ncompetition and fair dealing;\n\n14\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nOur non-employee directors receive compensation consisting of annual cash retainers for service on our Board and its standing committees, as well as equity grants awarded on an annual recurring basis as they remain a member of the Board. Non-employee directors joining the Board may also receive an equity grant in connection with their appointment to the Board. If elected to the Board, Ms. Schwarting is expected to receive compensation on the same terms as our other non-employee directors, including an equity grant.\n\nOur compensation committee periodically reviews compensation for our non-employee directors, including review of competitive practices provided by our compensation consultant. Our compensation committee last modified our non-employee director compensation program for fiscal year 2017 compensation. We believe our non-employee director compensation program provides reasonable compensation to our non-employee directors that is appropriately aligned with our peers and is commensurate with the services and contributions of our non-employee directors.\n\nCash Retainers. During fiscal year 2020, our non-employee directors received an annual retainer of $35,000, prorated for partial service in any year and paid in cash. The chairpersons of our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee each receive an additional annual retainer of $15,000, $10,000 and $7,500, respectively. Members of our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee, other than the chairpersons of those committees, receive an additional annual retainer of $10,000, $6,000 and $4,000, respectively. The individual acting as lead independent director, if any, receives an additional $15,000 annually for serving in that role. Cash retainers are paid in arrears at the end of each quarter for service during the previous quarter.\n\nStock Compensation. For fiscal year 2020, the equity award compensation structure for our non-employee directors generally remained the same as was adopted for fiscal year 2017 and was continued for subsequent years. Each continuing director received a restricted stock unit award with an initial grant date fair value (determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of approximately $200,000 vesting quarterly over 12 months following grant, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting dates. Accordingly, on September 3, 2019, each of the non-employee directors who were then serving on the Board received a restricted stock unit award covering 3,431 shares.\n\nEquity awards granted to our non-employee directors are subject to the terms and conditions of our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) which provides an annual limit of $500,000 on the total value of equity compensation that may be paid to each continuing non-employee director under the Plan. The Plan also provides an annual limit of $1,000,000 on the total value of equity compensation that may be paid to a new director in connection with being named to the Board. For these purposes, the value of an equity compensation award is determined as grant date fair value, which is determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the terms of the Plan, if awards, including those of our non-employee directors, are not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger of change in control of the Company, all awards accelerate in full, and for awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria are deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met. The Plan also provides that if equity awards granted to non-employee directors are assumed or substituted for in a change in control but, on or after such assumption or substitution, the individuals status as a director (or director of the successor) is terminated other than by a voluntary termination not requested by the acquirer, the non-employee directors equity awards immediately vest in full.\n\nStock Ownership Guidelines. The Board believes that all directors should maintain a meaningful personal financial stake in the Company to align their long-term interests with those of our shareholders. We maintain stock ownership guidelines that apply to our executive officers and non-employee directors. This policy requires non-employee directors to attain and maintain a minimum share ownership level equal to at least five times the annual cash retainer, i.e., $175,000 within five years of becoming a director. As of January 31, 2020, all of our non-employee directors satisfy the equity ownership guidelines.\n\n16\n\nPROPOSAL 2\n\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe audit committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Ambarellas independent registered public accounting firm, or independent auditors, for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, and has further directed that management submit the appointment of independent auditors for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited Ambarellas financial statements since fiscal year 2007. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n\nNeither Ambarellas Articles of Association nor other governing documents or law require shareholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Ambarellas independent auditors. However, the audit committee is submitting the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the audit committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of Ambarella and its shareholders.\n\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to the shareholders and will have the same effect as negative votes.\n\nPrincipal Accountant Fees and Services\n\nThe following table represents aggregate fees billed to Ambarella by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, all of which were approved by the audit committee:\n\n18\n\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE1\n\nThe audit committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving Ambarellas accounting, auditing, financial reporting, internal control and legal compliance functions by approving the services performed by Ambarellas independent accountants and reviewing their reports regarding Ambarellas accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls as set forth in a written charter adopted by the Board. Ambarellas management is responsible for preparing Ambarellas financial statements and the independent registered public accountants are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities by Ambarellas management and the independent registered public accountants.\n\nIn this context, the audit committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants. Management represented to the audit committee that Ambarellas consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the audit committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accountants. The audit committee has discussed with the independent registered public accountants matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC. In addition, the independent registered public accountants provided to the audit committee the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence) and the audit committee and the independent registered public accountants have discussed such accountants independence from Ambarella and its management. The audit committee has discussed with Ambarellas internal and independent registered public accountants, with and without management present, their evaluations of Ambarellas internal accounting controls and the overall quality of Ambarellas financial reporting.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in Ambarellas Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, for filing with the SEC.\n\nChristopher B. Paisley (Chairman)\n\nChenming C. Hu\n\nD. Jeffrey Richardson\n\n20\n\nPROPOSAL 3\n\nADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), allows our shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. At our annual meeting of shareholders held in 2015, the Companys shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, soliciting a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis and the Company holds such advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers annually. Accordingly, this year we again are asking our shareholders to provide an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, along with the accompanying compensation tables and narrative disclosures as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a say-on-pay proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers.\n\nThe say-on-pay vote is advisory, and as such is not binding on the Company, but it does provide the compensation committee with valuable information about shareholder opinion of our executive compensation policies and programs for consideration when determining executive compensation in the future. After the say on pay vote at this years annual meeting of stockholders, the next say-on-pay vote will be scheduled to occur at the Companys annual meeting of stockholders in 2021.\n\nPlease see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement beginning on page 23, the accompanying compensation tables and the narrative disclosures for greater detail about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2020 compensation of our named executive officers. We believe that our executive compensation programs have been effective in achieving long-term alignment of management and shareholder interests, consistent with the Companys philosophy on pay and performance.\n\nWe ask that you vote FOR the following resolution:\n\nRESOLVED: That the shareholders of Ambarella, Inc. hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and the narrative discussion, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement furnished for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nVote Required\n\nApproval, on an advisory basis, of named executive officer compensation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present and voting at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Unless otherwise indicated, proxies received will be voted FOR approval, on an advisory basis, of named executive officer compensation.\n\nThe Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.\n\n21\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information about our current executive officers and their respective ages as of March 31, 2020. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nPosition(s)\n\nFeng-Ming (Fermi) Wang, Ph.D.\n\n56 Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n63 Chief Technology Officer and Director\n\nKevin C.

For brief biographies of Dr. Wang and Mr. Kohn, please see Proposal 1  Election of Class II Directors above.\n\nKevin C. (Casey) Eichler has served as our Chief Financial Officer since August 2018. Prior to joining Ambarella, Mr. Eichler most recently served as President and Chief Financial Officer of Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. from March 2015 to July 2016 and as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from July 2009 to February 2015, where he oversaw all the financial reporting for the company, as well as business development and key customer relationships. Prior to joining Ultra Clean Holdings, Mr. Eichler was the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Credence Systems Corporation from January 2008 to November 2008, Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief Financial Officer of MarketTools, Inc. from March 2006 to December 2007, and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MIPS Technologies Inc. from June 1998 to February 2006. Prior to that, he held management positions with several technology companies, including Visigenic Software, NeXT Software and Microsoft. Mr. Eichler holds a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from St. Johns University.\n\nYun-Lung (Michael) Chen has served as our Vice President, Business Development since June 2011, and was Sr. Director of Sales from January 2005 to June 2011. Prior to joining Ambarella, Mr. Chen was Director of Sales for Marvell Technology, a semiconductor company, from December 2002 to October 2003. From October 1997 to October 2002, Mr. Chen served as Director of Sales for Wintech Microelectronics, a distributor of electronics. Mr. Chen holds a B.S. degree in industrial engineering from Tung Hai University in Taiwan.\n\nChristopher Day has served as our Vice President, Marketing and Business Development since March 2010. Prior to joining Ambarella, Mr. Day was President and Chief Executive Officer of Mobilygen, Inc., a video compression company from March 2007 to October 2008, prior to acquisition by Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and then served as Executive Director of Business Management of Maxim until March 2010. From February 2002 to February 2007, Mr. Day served as General Manager of Media Processing at NXP Semiconductors N.V., formerly Philips Semiconductor. From February 1998 to May 2001, Mr. Day served as Senior Director of Marketing for C-Cube Microsystems. Prior to joining C-Cube Microsystems, Mr. Day held sales and marketing positions at AuraVision, Inc., Motorola, Inc., and Hitachi, Ltd. Mr. Day holds a B.S. degree in computer and microprocessor systems from Essex University in the United Kingdom, and an M.B.A. from Santa Clara University.\n\n22\n\ncameras, wearable sports cameras, drone cameras and aftermarket automotive video recorders. Over the last several years, our development efforts have focused on creating advanced artificial intelligence, or AI, computer vision, or CV, algorithms and high-performance, low-power hardware platforms to enhance processing acceleration, which we refer to as our CVflow architecture. The CVflow architecture supports a variety of CV algorithms, including stereovision, object identification and motion detection, obstacle detection and avoidance, terrain mapping technology and face recognition, and allows customers to differentiate their products by porting their own algorithms and neural networks to our CVflow-based chips. This CV technology, combined with our traditional video and image processing technology, is allowing us to address a broader range of markets and applications, including the OEM automotive market and industrial and robotics applications, which we believe will be critical to our long term growth.\n\nOur business transformation to CV-centric products continued in fiscal year 2020. Between January 2018 and January 2019, we introduced our first four CV based SoCs to enable our customers to develop intelligent camera systems for a variety of markets at different feature levels. We focused our initial marketing efforts with these new SoCs on the professional IP security market, which tends to have a faster rate of adoption for new video processing technology. However, with our expanded portfolio of CV solutions, we are now targeting the professional IP security market, the home security and monitoring market, the OEM automotive market, as well as industrial and robotics applications. In the automotive market, our solutions address six different camera systems: video recorders, in-cabin and driver monitoring cameras, electronic mirrors, surround view monitoring, front camera advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), and autonomous driving systems.\n\nWe have discussed that we anticipate three initial waves of revenue from our new CV solutions. A first wave from adoption of our CV solutions in the professional IP security camera market, followed by a wave from the adoption of our solutions in the home security and monitoring market, and finally a wave from adoption by the automotive market. Our success in achieving these three waves is dependent upon continued timely research and development of new CV technology and solutions, as well as securing design wins with customers across these primary markets and getting the customers into production with our solutions.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020, we made substantial progress against our objectives, including:\n\nTransitioning to new markets and new customers presents significant challenges. For our transformation to be successful, we believe it is important to establish not only the robustness and competitiveness of our technology, but also that the Company is prepared to be a supplier to these markets. The automotive OEM market, in particular, tends to be more conservative than our traditional camera markets and places greater emphasis on quality and reliability. Exiting fiscal year 2020, we believed that we were well positioned to begin to capitalize on our CV-related efforts, in light of the number of companies that have gone into production with our CV solutions as well as the number of customers that purchased engineering parts, evaluation kits and/or development boards in fiscal year 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has created a significant amount of uncertainty and will likely continue to create uncertainty well into the 2020 calendar year and may have a negative impact on our financial results if the pandemic progresses in ways that significantly disrupt the manufacture, shipment and buying patterns of our products or the products of our customers.\n\n24\n\nImplementing Shareholder Feedback in Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Structure.\n\nSince our first annual Say on Pay vote in 2015, shareholders historically have shown strong support for our executive compensation program, with votes ranging between 93.3% to 95.8% of votes cast, which guided our compensation committee in making its decisions. Our Say on Pay proposal at our 2018 annual shareholder meeting, which took place during our 2019 fiscal year, received 56.4% shareholder support. In response to this lower level of support, we engaged in a shareholder outreach program to solicit feedback relating to executive compensation and corporate governance practices. The feedback we received from shareholders informed the compensation committees deliberations and decisions, resulting in the adoption of significant changes for our fiscal year 2020 NEO compensation programs, including:\n\nThese changes were initially disclosed in our 2019 proxy statement, which was prepared during our fiscal year 2020. In voting on the Say on Pay for our fiscal year 2019 executive compensation, our shareholders seemingly supported the changes, resulting in a Say on Pay vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of approximately 93% in favor of the executive compensation program.\n\nThe compensation committee is committed to engaging with shareholders on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. We also conduct ongoing reviews of our corporate governance policies, practices and market trends.\n\nPay for Performance. The cornerstone of our executive compensation program is pay for performance. Accordingly, while we pay competitive base salaries and other benefits, a significant portion of each of our NEOs compensation opportunity is based on variable pay in the form of performance-based bonuses and equity awards. As discussed above, our business has been undergoing a transition from our legacy consumer camera markets, such as wearable cameras and camera enabled drones, to AI-based CV applications for professional, automotive, and industrial and robotic applications. This multi-year effort has presented retention challenges. It is imperative to galvanize our employees and executives around the strategic initiatives during this transformation, which is critical to the Companys future success and business direction. For fiscal year 2020, we implemented a new framework for our annual bonus program by incorporating short-term strategic objectives in addition to annual financial metrics. We also recognize that sustainable long-term growth is significant for shareholders and, as a result, for fiscal year 2020 the PRSUs granted to all NEOs are based upon a three-year total shareholder return metric.\n\n26\n\nFramework for Determining Executive Compensation\n\nOverview\n\nOur executive compensation program has focused primarily on attracting executive talent to manage and operate our business, retaining individuals who are key to our growth and success, and rewarding individuals who help us achieve our business objectives. Our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, including engineering personnel as well as management talent. The pool of qualified candidates is often limited, particularly in Silicon Valley, and we often compete for talent with companies much larger than us and our peer group of companies (described below). To support these objectives, we provide a competitive total compensation package to our executive officers that we believe achieves the following:\n\nSince our initial public offering in 2012, our executive compensation program continues to evolve. We have continued to make incremental changes to our executive compensation program to adopt practices that are appropriate for the Company given our business, industry, size, growth, and other factors. We have engaged an independent compensation consultant since our initial public offering, including for fiscal year 2020, which assists our compensation committee in determining executive compensation. Over the last few years, we have considered and used different types of equity awards to grant our NEOs, as we strive to establish a mix that continues to appropriately emphasize pay for performance, compensation that is competitive with the market, appropriate incentive to drive our business success and retain our key talent, and responsive to shareholder feedback.\n\nPeer Companies\n\nIn setting executive compensation for fiscal year 2020, our compensation committee considered the compensation data gathered by Semler Brossy Consulting Group (Semler Brossy) for the Companys peer group of companies, although it did not benchmark or otherwise target our compensation to any specific percentile or range with respect to our compensation peers. The peer groups primary purpose is to inform on pay program design, relationship of pay and performance, and equity usage at companies with which the Company competes for customers and/or executive talent.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, based on shareholder and proxy advisor feedback that we received, the compensation committee decided that the peer group should be revised to more closely align with the Companys market cap, revenues, industry and growth profile. The peer group is formed among semiconductor companies with revenue that is 1/3 to 3 times the revenue of the Company. Based on Semler Brossys review of the group used in fiscal year 2019, six companies were removed for size and industry considerations, and one company was removed due to its acquisition. Six semiconductor companies, noted below, were added to ensure a robust comparator group and good industry fit.\n\n28\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Peer Group\n\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor (new) MaxLinear Aquantia (new) Monolithic Power Systems CEVA (new) NeoPhotonics (new) DSP Group (new) Power Integrations Impinj (new) Rambus Inphi Semtech Lattice Semiconductor Universal Display\n\nThe Role of the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors\n\nThe compensation committee is responsible for the executive compensation program for our executive officers. The compensation committee formally met five times during fiscal year 2020, to review and discuss matters related to compensation of our executive officers and senior management. Some of these meetings were held with members of management in attendance and some were held in closed session. Most of the meetings also included members of our compensation consultant (as described below). The compensation committee reports to the Board on its discussions and actions and, in some cases, recommends to the Board the decisions to be made and other actions to be taken with regard to our executive officers compensation. Our compensation committees decisions regarding executive compensation are based on the compensation committees assessment of the performance of the Company and each individual executive officer, as well as other factors, such as prevailing industry trends and the competitive market for executive talent.\n\nThe Role of Management\n\nOur CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) typically make recommendations to our compensation committee, attend certain compensation committee meetings and are involved in the process for setting our executive officers compensation, provided that neither our CEO nor our CFO makes recommendations as to his own compensation or participates in compensation committee discussion of their own compensation. Our compensation committee considers managements recommendations but is not required to follow any recommendations and may adjust compensation up or down as it determines in its discretion. Our compensation committee reviews the recommendations and other data and makes recommendations to the Board as to each executive officers total compensation, as well as each individual compensation component.\n\nThe Role of the Compensation Consultant\n\nThe compensation committee has authority to appoint and retain a compensation consultant. The reasonable fees for services rendered by the compensation consultant are paid by the Company. For fiscal year 2020, our compensation committee engaged Semler Brossy to provide compensation consulting services and Semler Brossy served at the discretion of compensation committee. Services provided by Semler Brossy included presenting market data and our compensation peer group companies (as described above) to the compensation committee; analyzing our NEOs salary, short-term incentive and equity incentive compensation in relation to market data; assisting the compensation committee with updating our equity incentive program to place greater emphasis on sustained long-term growth and to create incentive to achieve key strategic goals; assisting the compensation committee with a risk assessment; and attending compensation committee meetings as requested by the compensation committee. Semler Brossy provides no services to Ambarella other than those it provides to the compensation committee. The compensation committee assesses Semler Brossys independence annually under SEC and NASDAQ standards and has concluded that Semler Brossy was independent and that no conflict of interest exists as to its work.\n\n29\n\nElements of Executive Compensation\n\nThe compensation of our NEOs consists of the following principal components:\n\n\n\nbase salary;\n\n\n\nperformance-based bonuses;\n\n\n\nequity incentive awards; and\n\n\n\nseverance and change of control benefits.\n\nWe strive to achieve an appropriate mix between cash compensation and equity incentive awards to meet our objectives. We do not apply any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between current and long-term compensation, or between cash and equity compensation. We believe the most important indicator of whether our compensation objectives are being met is our ability to motivate our executive officers to deliver superior performance and retain them to continue their careers with us on a cost-effective basis. Our Board, led by our compensation committee, generally conducts an annual review of our executive compensation, as well as the mix of components used to compensate our NEOs. In reviewing and setting the executive compensation for fiscal year 2020, our compensation committee and Board relied on its collective judgment, recommendations from Dr. Wang (for executives other than Dr. Wang), the relative pay among the management team members, and its assessment of each executive officers role, responsibilities and overall contribution to the business in determining the size and mix of compensation for each executive, and Semler Brossys analysis of executive pay practices of the Companys compensation peers. Given our strong commitment to pay for performance, the large majority of each NEOs target direct compensation (salary, annual bonus opportunity, and target equity awards) was variable and subject to the achievement of key performance objectives that are important for the growth and success of the Company.\n\nKey changes in executive compensation for fiscal year 2020 include (additional details regarding these changes are provided in the sections that follow):\n\nBase Salary\n\nOur base salaries are intended to provide financial stability, predictability and security of compensation for our NEOs for fulfilling their core job responsibilities. The base salaries of our NEOs are based primarily on role, the scope of their responsibilities, experience, performance and contributions, and our compensation committees understanding of compensation paid to similarly situated executives. None of our NEOs has an employment agreement that provides for automatic or scheduled increases in base salary.\n\n30\n\nOur executives did not receive salary increases from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2018. Based upon market data that executive salaries were trailing behind market, the compensation committee approved increases to executive salaries, including a 3% increase for fiscal year 2020. The 3% increase in NEO salaries was below the increase for the Companys general employee population, which averaged 3.5% for fiscal year 2020. The following table sets forth the annual base salary for each of our NEOs for fiscal year 2020:\n\nName\n\nYear 2020\n\nBase\n\nSalary Change from\n\nFiscal Year 2019\n\nFermi Wang\n\n$ 367,700 3 %\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n$ 346,000 3 %\n\nCasey Eichler\n\n$ 334,800 3 %\n\nMichael Chen(1)\n\n$ 250,300 3 %\n\nChristopher Day\n\n$ 265,000 3 %\n\nAnnual Performance-Based Bonuses\n\nOur NEOs are eligible to receive bonuses under our annual bonus plan established at the beginning of the fiscal year. Annual bonuses are intended to motivate our executives to achieve, and reward our executives for achieving, important corporate financial and operational goals, as well as individual performance.\n\nAn annual bonus pool for employees and executives is established by the Board at the time the Companys annual operating budget is approved by the Board. For fiscal year 2020, the target bonus pool for executive bonuses was reduced 10% year-over-year from fiscal year 2019.\n\nIn establishing the fiscal year 2020 annual bonus plan, the Board deemed it appropriate to link compensation to our actual financial and operational performance. In prior years, the bonus program was based upon two equally weighted performance metrics, which were (i) annual revenue and (ii) annual operating profit, before bonus accruals. The compensation committee and the Board determined it was important to also have bonuses based upon performance against strategic objectives important to the Companys business transition. Accordingly, for fiscal year 2020, the bonus program was based upon three equally weighted performance metrics: (i) annual revenue, (ii) annual operating profit, before bonus accruals, and (iii) a set of five strategic objectives. Once achievement of these performance goals has been certified by the compensation committee, the target pool size is adjusted to between a threshold of 70% and a maximum of 200% based upon the level of achievement. The pool is then distributed to individual executives as determined by the Board, with input from the CEO, based on factors such as historical allocation, the executives role and individual contribution to the Companys financial results and strategic objectives.\n\nPerformance Metric Selection and Goal Setting.\n\nIn discussing our executive compensation program with shareholders during our fiscal year 2019, we heard that the annual strategic performance goals previously used in our PRSUs were better suited for an annual compensation program rather than in our long-term equity program. Accordingly, for fiscal year 2020 we included annual strategic performance goals in our fiscal year 2020 annual bonus plan to incentivize our management team to successfully accomplish short term strategic objectives that we believe will create long term value. We maintained the revenue and operating profit metrics in the program as we believe it is important to maintain focus on overall growth of the business and to ensure that revenue generation is balanced with efforts in achieving profitable growth. For fiscal year 2020, the three metrics were weighted equally.\n\n31\n\nThese performance objectives were chosen because the compensation committee and Board believe that these are important financial metrics that reflect our performance as a growing company. While revenue remained an important focus for the Companys overall business success, the operating profit goal also was important to ensure that the pursuit of revenue was balanced with efforts in achieving profitable margins and the management of expenses. The operating profit goal is a non-GAAP measure and refers to our GAAP operating income less the impact of stock-based compensation and the associated tax impact and excluding bonus accruals. The strategic goals are a non-GAAP measure consisting of five short-term strategic objectives significant to the Companys transition from traditional image and video processors to CV solutions for a broader range of markets, including advanced automotive cameras and industrial and robotics applications.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we set a revenue target of $205.5 million and an operating profit target of $2.3 million. In setting these targets, the compensation committee and Board considered our then-current operating plan for fiscal year 2020, then-current forecasts and projections, as well as prevailing industry conditions. The compensation committee acknowledged these represented lower targets from the prior fiscal year, but intended that the difficulty of attaining the goals would be relatively consistent with prior years and would require strong operational performance. At the time of the compensation committees goal setting, the Company continued to be in the midst of its transition from its traditional specialized consumer camera markets, such as wearable sports cameras and drones, to new markets focused on CV applications, but was unlikely to generate significant revenue from its new CV solutions until late in fiscal year 2020. More significantly, there was substantial concern of disruption among our large China IP security camera customers due to geopolitical and trade factors. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 was anticipated to negatively impact the ability of two large Chinese IP security camera customers to sell products into the U.S. market, which could decrease those customers demand for the Companys solutions. There was also concern that the brewing trade dispute between the US and China could impact demand for the Companys solutions in China.\n\nIn light of these factors, the primary challenges for fiscal year 2020 also included growing revenue in IP security camera markets outside of China, as well as in the automotive market, while continuing to invest substantially in research and development of the Companys CV technology without significantly sacrificing profitability. For the fiscal year 2020 annual bonus plan, the five strategic objectives related to the long-term success of the Companys business transition and were as follows:\n\n\n\nResearch and development milestones in autonomous driving applications.\n\nTarget achievement of the performance goals of $205.5 million in revenue, $2.3 million in operating profit before bonus accruals and achievement of 3 points worth of strategic goals, would result in 100% of the approved bonus pool becoming funded and available for payment to executives. Maximum achievement of the performance goals at $246.7 million in revenue, $17.3 million in operating profit before bonus accruals, and achievement of five points worth of strategic goals would result in 200% of the bonus pool becoming funded and payable. Threshold performance at $199.4 million in revenue, -$0.7 million in operating profit before bonus, and achievement of 0.5 points of performance goals would result in 70% of approved bonus pool being funded. Failure to achieve threshold performance of any specific metric would result in no payout for that portion of the bonus pool, and failure to achieve threshold performance on all metrics would result in none of the bonus pool becoming payable. Payouts between performance targets is based on a linear interpolation. Under our fiscal\n\n32\n\nyear 2020 annual bonus plan, our compensation committee and board of directors had the discretion to reduce, eliminate or increase the size of the bonus pool and the individual bonuses. No discretionary adjustments were made to the bonus pool for fiscal year 2020.\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Annual Bonus Metric Weighting\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Performance.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we exceeded targets of each of the three metrics, resulting in funding of the bonus pool at a level of 161% of target. The higher than target revenue was primarily attributable to higher revenue from the home security and monitoring portion of the IP security camera market, primarily in the North America region, and the sports camera market. In the professional IP security camera market, despite increased adoption of our CV solutions, lower demand from one of our largest China customers and customers in other regions resulted in a net revenue decrease in fiscal year 2020. The higher than target operating profit was primarily due to the increased revenue, along with control over operating costs. For fiscal year 2020, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $39.4 million, as compared to $24.5 million in fiscal year 2019. We achieved or partially achieved 4 of the 5 strategic objectives, including: development of our CV22FS SoC, reaching production status with CV solutions with customers in the professional IP security camera market, securing design wins for next generation home security and monitoring cameras using our new CV solutions; and research and development milestones in autonomous driving applications.\n\nMetric\n\nWeight Target\n\nPerformance\n\nGoal Actual\n\nResults Payout\n\nFactor (% of\n\nTarget)\n\nRevenue\n\n33 1/3% $ 205.5M $ 228.7 157.0 %\n\nOperating Profit\n\n33 1/3% $ 2.30M $ 19.59 189.0 %\n\nStrategic Goals\n\n33 1/3% 3.0 points 3.75 points 137.5 %\n\nTotal\n\n100% 161.0 %\n\nAs mentioned above, no discretionary adjustments were made to the bonus pool for fiscal year 2020. The compensation committee, in making its recommendation to the Board, considered whether a downward adjustment would be appropriate in light of the lower metric targets set for fiscal year 2020. The compensation committee determined that in light of a number of factors, including the markets reaction to the Companys fiscal year 2020 revenue and operating income, based in terms of shareholder return, as well as the strategic progress made by the Company in gaining traction for its CV products, no adjustment would be made.\n\n33\n\nIndividual Bonus Opportunity.\n\nTypically, actual allocation of the bonus pool to individual executive officers, including our NEOs, is made by the Board (with the recommendation of the compensation committee) at the conclusion of the fiscal year. This allocation is generally based on historical allocation, the executives individual contribution to the Companys financial and operational results and with a focus on executive retention in light of prevailing market conditions in our industry, and taking into consideration Dr. Wangs recommendations for NEOs other than himself. For fiscal year 2020, our NEOs received the following bonuses:\n\nName\n\nFiscal Year\n\n2020 Bonus Fiscal Year\n\n2019 Bonus Fiscal Year\n\n2020 Share of\n\nBonus Pool\n\nFermi Wang\n\n$ 479,200 $ 0 22.3 %\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n$ 336,302 $ 0 15.6 %\n\nCasey Eichler\n\n$ 242,102 $ 0 11.3 %\n\nMichael Chen\n\n$ 125,071 $ 0 5.8 %\n\nChristopher Day\n\n$ 111,026 $ 0 5.2 %\n\nOther Executives (Not NEOs)\n\n39.8 %\n\nThe bonus awards were paid out to NEOs and other high- and mid-level employees in March 2020 in the form of fully-vested stock awards.\n\nEquity Incentive Awards\n\nEquity-based compensation has been our primary long-term incentive compensation component. Our equity-based compensation is intended to offer both retention incentives and long-term performance, through equity awards with a mix of time-based and performance-based vesting. We continue to believe that shared financial success in long-term incentives motivates our executive officers to grow revenue and earnings, enhance shareholder value and more closely align the interests of our shareholders and executives. In general, equity awards are made on a quarterly basis on the second business day following the Companys quarterly earnings release.\n\nLong-Term Incentive Design.\n\nAs part of our holistic review of compensation programs in fiscal year 2017 we updated our annual equity grant structure, which was used for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. The primary design change was the introduction of PRSUs into our equity program. This change in design was intended to further focus executive officers on sustained long-term growth in the coming years and to create a significant incentive to achieve key strategic priorities that the compensation committee and Board believed were critical to the Companys transition from its legacy consumer camera markets to computer vision applications. Under the original design, 50% of equity awards for the CEO (and 30% for other NEOs) was granted as performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) and the remainder was granted as restricted stock units subject to time-based vesting over multiple years. For fiscal year 2020, all NEOs received 50% of the equity awards as PRSUs and 50% as time-based vesting RSUs. This mix balanced our emphasis on tying our long-term financial performance and shareholder value creation to the executive officers financial gain, with our need to effectively retain our key talent.\n\n34\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, the Board, upon recommendation of the compensation committee, established a target equity award pool, which included both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, for our NEOs and other executives. Equity award grants were then allocated to individual executives based upon a number of factors, including individual performance, retention needs, historical allocations and competitive market data. The target total equity award for our CEO did not increase from the reduced level implemented in fiscal year 2019. The individual RSU and PRSU grants for our NEOs for fiscal year 2020 were as follows:\n\nName\n\nTime-based\n\nRSUs (#) Value of\n\nTime-based\n\nRSUs ($) PRSUs\n\n(at Target)\n\n(#) Value of\n\nPRSUs (at\n\nTarget) ($)\n\nFermi Wang\n\n42,873 1,806,239 42,873 2,457,052\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n35,604 1,499,997 35,604 2,040,465\n\nCasey Eichler\n\n14,242 600,015 14,242 816,209\n\nMichael Chen\n\n8,492 357,768 8,492 486,677\n\nChristopher Day\n\n8,011 337,503 8,011 459,110\n\nThe number of PRSUs granted was determined in the same method as the time-based RSUs, by dividing the target dollar amount by the fair market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the RSUs for accounting purposes was determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to the RSU by the closing price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant and is reflected above and in the Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards tables below. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs for accounting purposes was determined using a Monte Carlo analysis, and is the value reflected above and in the Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards tables below.\n\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Unit Design Detail.\n\nOne-half of equity awards was granted as restricted stock units subject to time-based vesting. These annual restricted stock units granted to our NEOs vest in equal quarterly installments over the three years following grant, subject to continued service of the executive.\n\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Program Design.\n\nPrior to fiscal year 2020, our performance-based equity awards included two types of performance metrics: one metric tied to annual strategic objectives and one metric tied to the Companys three-year total shareholder return (TSR). Feedback received from shareholders emphasized that annual performance goals were not appropriate for long term equity programs. In direct response to the shareholder feedback that informed our compensation committees decisions for fiscal year 2020, the Company removed the one-year strategic performance goals form its PRSUs and utilized only a three-year TSR metric under which the Companys total shareholder return is measured against the median company in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index for the period from February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2022. As structured, 100% of the target number of PRSUs granted for fiscal 2020 each NEO is scheduled to vest subject to the executives continued service through March 15, 2022, with the number of PRSUs vesting subject to increase or decrease of up to 100% of the target number of PRSUs based on performance against the TSR metric. As a result, a minimum of 0 shares under each PRSU may vest, and a maximum of 200% of the target number of PRSUs may vest, based on relative TSR performance during the performance period. As equity is the largest component of our NEOs compensation, we believe this change, along with the change to make all NEOs 50%/50%, further focuses our management team on long-term value creation for further alignment with shareholder interests. This revised structure was retained for the equity awards made to our NEOs for fiscal year 2021.\n\nSeverance and Change of Control Benefits\n\nEmployment of our executive officers is at will. Prior to our initial public offering, we entered into severance and change of control agreements with Dr. Wang and Messrs. Kohn and Day, pursuant to which they\n\n35\n\nare entitled to receive compensation and other benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment and terminations of employment in connection with a change of control event. Following his hiring, we entered into a change of control agreement with Mr. Eichler in substantially the same form as Dr. Wangs and Mr. Kohns agreement, except without a tax gross-up provision.\n\nOur goal in providing certain severance and change of control benefits is to offer sufficient cash continuity protection such that the executive will focus his full time and attention on the requirements of our business rather than the potential implications for his respective position. We prefer to have certainty and internal parity regarding the potential severance amounts payable to our NEOs under certain circumstances, rather than negotiating severance at the time that an NEOs employment terminates. We have also determined that accelerated vesting provisions are appropriate because they will encourage our NEOs to stay focused in such circumstances, rather than the potential implications for them.\n\nThese agreements are described in more detail below under Employment, Severance and Change of Control Arrangements.\n\nBroad Based Employee Benefits\n\nWe believe that establishing competitive benefit packages for our employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Each NEO is eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans generally applicable to employees on a broad basis in the country in which the executive is located. Our U.S.-based NEOs are eligible to participate in our U.S.-based employee benefits plans, such as medical, dental, disability, vision, group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, our patent incentive program and our 401(k) plan, in each case on the same basis as other U.S.-based salaried employees. Mr. Chen is based in Taiwan and as a result, he participates in the generally available employee benefit plans maintained for our Taiwan employees.\n\nWe do not offer excessive perquisites to any of our NEOs as that would be inconsistent with our egalitarian corporate culture.\n\nAnti-hedging and Anti-pledging\n\nUnder our insider trading policy, all of our independent directors and executive officers, including all of our NEOs, are prohibited from any hedging or similar transactions designed to decrease the risks associated with holding our securities. In addition, our NEOs may not pledge our securities as collateral for loans.\n\nStock Ownership Guidelines\n\nWe have established stock ownership guidelines applicable to our NEOs and non-employee directors. The guidelines promote share ownership by requiring NEOs and non-employee directors to attain and maintain a minimum share ownership level equal to a multiple of his or her base salary or annual cash retainer. The required ownership levels under the guidelines are as follows:\n\nPosition\n\nOwnership Requirement\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n5x Annual Base Salary\n\nOther Executive Officers\n\n3x Annual Base Salary\n\nNon-Employee Director\n\n5x Annual Cash Retainer\n\nShould any NEO or non-employee director not satisfy the stock ownership guidelines (as described above) such NEO or non-employee director must retain at least 50% of any net shares derived from vested restricted stock or restricted stock units, exercised stock options or stock purchase plan holdings until his or her guideline is met. Net shares are those shares that remain after shares are sold or netted to pay the exercise price (if any) of\n\n36\n\nequity awards and applicable taxes. As of January 31, 2020, all of our NEOs and non-employee directors satisfy their equity ownership requirements.\n\nClawback Policy\n\nOur Board has adopted an Executive Compensation Clawback Policy. Under the policy, if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws caused by misconduct, we can seek recoupment from current or former NEOs who participated in the misconduct of an amount corresponding to any performance-based compensation (including any annual bonus or equity-based awards) that the Company determines would not have been granted, vested or paid had the Companys results as originally reported been equal to the Companys results as subsequently restated. The policy applies to incentive compensation granted for fiscal years commencing after January 31, 2017.\n\nAccounting and Tax Considerations\n\nSection 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to our CEO, CFO and certain other executives. While the Board and our compensation committee generally consider the financial accounting and tax implications of compensation decisions, neither element has been a material consideration in the compensation awarded to our NEOs historically. To maintain flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner designed to achieve our corporate objectives, the Board and compensation committee do not require that all compensation be deductible.\n\nWe account for equity compensation paid to our employees under applicable accounting guidance for stock-based compensation arrangements, which requires us to estimate and record an expense over the service period of the award. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured and recorded at grant date, based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite employee service period.\n\nCompensation Risk Assessment\n\nOur compensation committee assesses and considers potential risks when considering and approving the compensation programs for our executive officers and employees. Based upon this assessment"
