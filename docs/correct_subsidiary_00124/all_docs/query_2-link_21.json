        "text": "With two profit warnings behind it, Zoran (Nasdaq: ZRAN)'s share has not only recovered, but actually skyrocketed over 100% in the second quarter of 2001, 64% in June alone. Since its nadir on 19 December 2000, Zoran has climbed 135%. The past three days of trading, Zoran posted a 20% surge on especially heavy turnover, closing at $31.23 on July 3, reflecting a company value of $540.7 million. Tuesday's turnover was $839,400, compared with an average daily turnover of $365,000 in the past three months.\n\nThere are several possible factors behind the climb. The first is that Zoran has numerous new, as yet undeclared, customers with strong marketing networks and internationally recognized brands. A second factor is apparently the \"Buy\" recommendation by Pacific Growth investment bank analyst Brian Alger, who also raised the target price to $30 from $24. Alger expects a strong second quarter for the company, thanks to its ever-expanding market share. Alger also expects Zoran to do particularly well in the US market.\n\nAnother factor might be Zoran's announcement last Monday that Sharp will begin marketing its new mobile DVDs containing Zoran's chip that enables recording onto DVDs.\n\n\"The announcement about the marketing of the DVD decoder is very important,\" says Union Bank analyst Amir Hayek. \"The decoder allows recording onto DVDs. This is a major breakthrough for Zoran, because until now, DVDs' main drawback compared with VCRs was their inability to record. Six months ago, C-Cube Microsystems (Nasdaq: CUBE), one of Zoran's prominent competitors, announced it was launching a DVD recorder, hurting Zoran. Zoran's announcement closed the gap. It's only a start, but the technology is crucial for Zoran, and it may be assumed that it contributed to the share's rise in the past few days,\" he concluded.\n\nHarel Capital Markets analyst Micha Malka said, \"Monday's deal with Sharp means that Zoran’s Vaddis-4 chip will be installed in Sharp's 8-inch DVDs. Zoran's chip offers substantial savings in energy, using only 1 Watt to operate an 8-inch screen. This will allow the viewing of a full-length movie with only a single battery.\"\n\nAn additional reason for the rise apparently was LSI Logic Corporation's (Nasdaq: LSI) acquisition of competitor C-Cube Microsystems. LSI Logic develops computer-based systems. The company's core business is converters for cable television, not DVDs.\n\n\"LSI Logic wasn't a direct competitor of Zoran,\" says Hayek. \"The acquisition of C-Cube Microsystems is partly intended to strengthen LSI Logic's position in the cable and satellite television converter field. DVDs are important to the company because there's already talk of future integration of all the systems: Computers, DVD, satellite, and cable television, etc. This means that on one hand, there's one less competitor in the DVD market, but on the other hand, C-Cube Microsystems isn't leaving the market entirely, and its consumer business could even be strengthened. Meanwhile, C-Cube's acquisition provides Zoran with a breathing space to expand its consumer market share.\"\n\n\"Globes\": How do you explain the capital market's optimism about Zoran?\n\nZoran Senior VP Business Development Isaac Shenberg: \"In principle, we don't comment on the share. As for our markets, we can say that they're doing well and are unaffected by the slowdown. We also have several developments that have been sold to customers, and sales to consumers will begin in the second half of the year. Two days ago, we also announced the start of a deal with Sharp to market our DVD recorder chip. In early May, we announced that Pinnacle Systems (Nasdaq: PCLE) would start consumer marketing of video streaming using Zoran chips developed by Nogatech (with which Zoran merged last year). In late May, we announced that Samsung would begin consumer marketing of digital cameras using Zoran components.\"\n\nWhat is currently happening in your markets?\n\n\"The DVD market is forecast to grow 60-70% in 2001 compared with 2000. Of all consumer electronics, DVDs have had the highest penetration rate in Western history, surpassing televisions, VCRs, audio products, CDs, faxes, etc. Zoran has a good position in the DVD market. The digital camera market also looks promising in light of its 50% annual growth rate.\"\n\n\"Moreover, Zoran components were installed in scores of different DVD recorder models, including those of Toshiba, Sharp, and Orion. Many models are also sold by third parties; i.e. companies buy finished products from the large corporations to sell under different brand names.\"\n\nWhat is the status of chips combining the capabilities of Zoran and Nogatech ?\n\n\"We estimate development of combined capabilities will take a year.\"\n\nMicha Malka says, \"In principle, I assume that it will be possible to call Zoran's share the stock of the year, given market developments. As for the reasons behind the climbing price, it may very well be that some of it was a correction. The share was simply trading at a discount, and $31 is a very reasonable price for it. We're recommending a price of $38-40. A second reason may be the closing of the gap after a delay in production. Remember that the company lost $8 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, due to delays in chip production for digital cameras by a manufacturer. The delay included a postponement of a $3 million deal, and production was postponed to 2001.\"\n\n\"Zoran has also had some good news lately, which has apparently given the share momentum. On May 23, for example, the company announced that Samsung had chosen its 'Chip-On-A-Camera' (COACH) chips for their new digital cameras.\"\n\n\"On June 25, Zoran presented its CamMini III product, combining COACH and CMOS chips, at an exhibition in New York. The chips were developed by PixelCam. This combined platform allows camera manufacturers to reduce production time and costs, lowering camera prices for consumers. It also allows more picture frames per camera.\"\n\nZoran acquired PixelCam last year. Two months later Shenberg told \"Globes\", \"We believe that we'll begin seeing the results of the PixelCam acquisition in the financial statements for the second half of 2001.\" Judging from the results, Zoran has not only met the target, but brought it forward.\n\nMalka says, \"The DVD market is growing 60% a year, and the digital camera market is also growing extremely rapidly. When you also take into account the fact that Zoran's products help cut production costs for camera manufacturers, greatly increasing their orders, it's not hard to understand why Zoran's share is in demand. The company's products have also won awards recently.\"\n\nAmir Hayek says, \"The big breakthrough for Zoran's shares was three trading days ago, when it broke the psychological $25 barrier. Remember, the company published a profit warning at the end of December, and as a result, the share fell precipitously to below $10. Five days later, it rose to $20, then back to $13 over 11 trading days. In mid-March, it was back to $13, and has been rising steadily ever since. The $25 barrier remained in the background, in spite of everything. Breaking the barrier was a positive signal to the market.\"\n\n\"I think the slowdown did hurt the share somewhat, although the blow was in no way comparable to what happened to the organizations and telecom sectors. The lowering of US interest rates has enabled American consumers to continue their spree – and the US is Zoran's main market, the one driving all these processes. In other words, demand is still high.\""
