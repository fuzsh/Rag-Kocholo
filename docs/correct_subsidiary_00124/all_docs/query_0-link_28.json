To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of Ambarella, Inc. for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015.\n\n3. To conduct any other business properly brought before the meeting.\n\nThese items of business are more fully described in the Proxy Statement accompanying this Notice.\n\nThe record date for the Annual Meeting is April 15, 2014. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date may vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.\n\nBy Order of the Board of Directors\n\nMichael Morehead\n\nGeneral Counsel and Secretary\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\nMay 2, 2014\n\nYou are cordially invited to attend the meeting in person. Whether or not you expect to attend the meeting, please complete, date, sign and return the proxy mailed to you, or vote over the telephone or the Internet as instructed in these materials, as promptly as possible to ensure your representation at the meeting. Even if you have voted by proxy, you may still vote in person if you attend the meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must obtain a proxy issued in your name from that record holder.\n\nAmbarella, Inc.\n\n3101 Jay Street\n\nSanta Clara, CA 95054\n\nPROXY STATEMENT\n\nFOR THE 2014 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\n\nINFORMATION CONCERNING VOTING AND SOLICITATION\n\nThis Proxy Statement is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Ambarella, Inc., a Cayman Islands company, (the Board), of proxies to be used at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and any adjournments or postponements thereof. The Annual Meeting will be held at the Companys corporate headquarters located at 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054, beginning at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time on June 4, 2014. The Company intends to mail this Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy card on or about May 2, 2014 to all shareholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.\n\nReferences to the Company, Ambarella, we, us or our throughout this Proxy Statement mean Ambarella, Inc.\n\nAppointment of Proxy Holders\n\nThe Board asks you to appoint Feng-Ming (Fermi) Wang, George Laplante and Michael Morehead as your proxy holders to vote your shares at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. You make this appointment by voting the enclosed proxy card using one of the voting methods described below.\n\nIf appointed by you, the proxy holders will vote your shares as you direct on the matters described in this Proxy Statement. In the absence of your direction, they will vote your shares as recommended by the Board.\n\nUnless you otherwise indicate on the proxy card, you also authorize your proxy holders to vote your shares on any matters not known by the Board at the time this Proxy Statement was printed and which may be properly presented for action at the Annual Meeting.\n\nWho Can Vote\n\nOnly shareholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2014 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On this record date, there were 29,200,755 ordinary shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Each holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote for each share held as of April 15, 2014. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors.\n\nShareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name\n\nIf on April 15, 2014, your shares were registered directly in your name with Ambarellas transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to fill out and return the proxy mailed to you or vote by proxy over the telephone or on the internet as instructed below to ensure your vote is counted.\n\nBeneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank\n\nIf on April 15, 2014, your shares were held, not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and the\n\n1\n\nProxy Statement is being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.\n\nHow You Can Vote\n\nYou may either vote For the nominees for Class II Director or you may Withhold your vote for the nominees. For each of the other matters to be voted on, you may vote For or Against or abstain from voting.\n\nThe procedures for voting are fairly simple:\n\nShareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name\n\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, vote by proxy over the telephone, vote by proxy through the internet or vote by proxy the enclosed proxy card. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.\n\nBeneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank\n\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, you should have received this Proxy Statement along with voting instructions from that organization rather than from Ambarella. Simply follow the voting instructions in the voting instruction card that may be delivered to you to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or bank, or contact your broker or bank to request a proxy form.\n\nMatters to be Voted Upon\n\nThere are two matters scheduled for a vote at the Annual Meeting:\n\nRegardless of how you own your shares, if you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by attending the Annual Meeting at the Companys corporate headquarters located at 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054,\n\n2\n\nbeginning at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time on June 4, 2014. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or vote by telephone or the Internet so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.\n\nIf you vote via the internet, by telephone or return a proxy card by mail, but do not select a voting preference, the persons who are authorized on the proxy card and through the internet and telephone voting facilities to vote your shares will vote:\n\nRevocation of Proxies\n\nShareholders of record can revoke their proxies at any time before they are exercised in any of three ways:\n\nBeneficial owners of shares held in street name must contact their broker, bank or other agent to revoke any prior voting instructions.\n\nRequired Vote\n\nDirectors are elected by a plurality vote, which means that the three (3) nominees for Class II director receiving the most affirmative votes will be elected. All other matters submitted for shareholder approval, including the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015, require the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote.\n\nA quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid Annual Meeting. A quorum will be present if shareholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy. On the record date, there were 29,200,755 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. As a result, shareholders holding at least 14,600,378 shares will need to be present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote by telephone or over the Internet or in person at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, then either the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of shares present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting to another date.\n\nAbstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote on that matter and have the same effect as a vote against such matter.\n\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker, in its discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on routine matters. Only Proposal 2 (ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. Proposal 1 (election of directors) is not considered a routine matter, and without your instruction, your broker cannot vote your shares as to that proposal. If your broker returns a proxy card but does not vote\n\n3\n\nyour shares, this results in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. However, as brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 1, broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast on Proposal 1.\n\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately count: with respect to the election of the director, For and Withhold votes and, with respect to other proposals, votes For and Against, abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Abstentions will be counted towards the vote total for Proposal 2, and will have the same effect as Against votes. Broker non-votes, although counted toward the quorum requirement, will not be counted towards the vote total for any proposal.\n\nOther Matters Brought Before the Meeting\n\nThe Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.\n\nSolicitation of Proxies\n\nThe Company will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, the Companys directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. The Company also may reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.\n\nVoting Results\n\nPreliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that the Company expects to file within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are not available in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the meeting, the Company intends to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results.\n\nImportant\n\nPlease promptly vote and submit your proxy by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-prepaid return envelope, or vote by telephone or via the Internet so that your shares can be voted. This will not limit your rights to attend or vote at the Annual Meeting.\n\n4\n\nPROPOSAL 1\n\nELECTION OF CLASS II DIRECTORS\n\nAmbarellas Board of Directors, or the Board, currently has seven (7) members. The authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the Board. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors even if less than a quorum, unless the Board determines that the vacancies shall be filled by the shareholders. A director elected to fill a vacancy in a class, including vacancies created by an increase in the number of directors, shall serve for the remainder of the full term of that class and until the directors successor is duly elected and qualified.\n\nThe Board is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, which serve staggered three-year terms:\n\nThree (3) Class II directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2017 or until their successors are elected and qualified. The Board, upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, selected Messrs. Kohn, Richardson and Tan as nominees for election as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting. The proxies given to the proxy holders will be voted or not voted as directed and, if no direction is given, will be voted FOR the three (3) nominees. If any nominee is unable or declines to serve as director at the time of the Annual Meeting, an event not now anticipated, proxies will be voted for any nominee designated by the Board to fill the vacancy. The three (3) nominees for Class II director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected as Class I directors.\n\nThe names of the nominees for election as Class II director, who have been nominated by the Board, and the names of the continuing directors not up for election at the Annual Meeting, along with certain biographical information about the nominees and continuing directors, including the directors business experience, public company director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the nominating and corporate governance committee to recommend that the director should continue to serve on the Board, are set forth below.\n\n(1) Member of Audit Committee\n\n(2) Member of Compensation Committee\n\n(3) Member of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\n(4) Lead Independent Director\n\nLeslie D.

The Board and its committees met throughout the year on a set schedule and held special meetings from time to time as appropriate. The Board held five meetings during the 2014 fiscal year. Each director attended at least 75% of the total aggregate of the regularly scheduled and special meetings held by the Board and the committees on which such director served during his tenure in fiscal 2014. Our non-management directors meet in regularly scheduled sessions without the presence of management in executive sessions. The lead independent director of the Board presides over each such executive session. We do not have a policy regarding directors attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of our directors will be independent. Based on the review and recommendation by the nominating and corporate governance committee, the Board has determined that Chenming Hu, Christopher Paisley, Jeffrey Richardson, Lip-Bu Tan, and Andrew Verhalen, representing a majority of our directors, are independent directors under the rules of NASDAQ. In making this determination, the Board of Directors found that none of these directors or nominees for director had a material or other disqualifying relationship with Ambarella. Feng-Ming Wang, Ambarellas Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Leslie Kohn, Ambarellas Chief Technical Officer, are not independent directors by virtue of their employment with Ambarella.\n\nIn evaluating Mr. Tans independence, the Board considered Mr. Tans position as President and Chief Executive Officer of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, with whom we have several agreements to provide us with design tools. However, the Board noted that Mr. Tan did not derive any direct or indirect material benefit from such agreements, Mr. Tan did not participate in the negotiation of these agreements and our Board believes that such agreements are in our best interest and on terms no less favorable than could be obtained from other third parties. In addition, the Board noted that the dollar amounts of payments to Cadence pursuant to these agreements will not constitute a material percentage of the revenue of Cadence, or of our revenue or total operating expenses.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nThe Board is currently chaired by Dr. Wang, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Ambarella. We believe that combining the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman helps to ensure that the Board and management act with a common purpose. In our view, separating the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman has the potential to give rise to divided leadership, which could interfere with good decision-making or weaken our ability to develop and implement strategy. Instead, we believe that combining the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman provides a single, clear chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans. In addition, we believe that a combined Chief Executive Officer and Chairman is better positioned to act as a bridge between management and the Board, facilitating the regular flow of information.\n\nThe Board determined as part of our corporate governance principles that one of our independent directors should serve as a lead director at any time when the title of chairman is held by an employee director or there is no current chairman. The Board has determined that Lip-Bu Tan qualifies as an independent director under the rules of NASDAQ. Accordingly, the Board has appointed Mr. Tan as our lead independent director. Mr. Tan presides over periodic meetings of our independent directors, has the responsibility of raising issues with management on behalf of the outside directors when appropriate and oversees the function of the Board and committees, among other responsibilities.\n\nWe believe that the current leadership structure of the Board is appropriate at the present time and allows the Board to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently based on our current needs.\n\n11\n\nBoard Committees\n\nWe have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Each of the committees has authority to engage legal counsel or other experts or consultants, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Board has determined that each member of each committee meets the applicable NASDAQ rules and regulations regarding independence and that each member is free of any relationship that would impair his individual exercise of independent judgment with regard to Ambarella. We intend to comply with future requirements as they become applicable to us. Each of the committees operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, each of which can be found on our website at http://investor.ambarella.com. Each committee has the composition and responsibilities described below.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is currently composed of three directors: Mr. Paisley, Dr. Hu and Mr. Richardson. Mr. Paisley serves as the chairman of the committee. The Audit Committee met four times during fiscal year 2014. Mr. Verhalen served as a member of the Audit Committee throughout fiscal year 2014 and until March 2014, when Mr. Richardson was appointed to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe responsibilities of our audit committee include:\n\n\n\nproviding oversight with respect to related party transactions;\n\nThe Board has determined that Mr. Paisley qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined in applicable SEC rules. The Board made a qualitative assessment of Mr. Paisleys level of knowledge and experience based on a number of factors, including his formal education and experiences as a chief financial officer for public reporting companies, as well as his service on the audit committees of other publicly traded companies. The Board has determined that Mr. Paisleys simultaneous service on multiple audit committees would not impair his ability to effectively serve on our audit committee.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nThe compensation committee is currently composed of three directors: Mr. Verhalen, Dr. Hu and Mr. Tan. Mr. Verhalen serves as the chairman of the committee. The compensation committee met four times during fiscal year 2014.\n\nThe responsibilities of our compensation committee include:\n\n12\n\nEach member of the compensation committee is a non-employee director, as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and an outside director, as defined pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee is currently composed of three directors: Mr. Tan, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Verhalen. Mr. Tan serves as the chairman of the committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee met two times during fiscal year 2013.\n\nThe responsibilities of our nominating and corporate governance committee include:\n\n\n\nreviewing and evaluating incumbent directors;\n\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\n\nOne of the key functions of the Board is informed oversight of our risk management process. The Board does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board as a whole, as well as through its standing committees that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, the Board is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure. Our audit committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The audit committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our external audit function. Our nominating and corporate governance committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines. Our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nDuring fiscal year 2014, Mr. Verhalen, Dr. Hu and Mr. Tan served as members of the compensation committee. None of the members of our compensation committee is or has in the past served as an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the Board or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on the Board or compensation committee.\n\n13\n\nDirector Nominations\n\nThe Board nominates directors for election at each annual meeting of shareholders and elects new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. The nominating and corporate governance committee has the responsibility to identify, evaluate, recruit and recommend qualified candidates to the Board for nomination or election.\n\nDirector Criteria. The nominating and corporate governance committee has a policy regarding consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews suggestions for director candidates recommended by shareholders and considers such candidates for recommendation based upon an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience and capability. In addition to considering an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience and capability, the Board has as an objective that its membership be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Except as may be required by rules promulgated by Nasdaq or the SEC, there are currently no specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by each candidate for the Board, nor are there any specific qualities or skills that are necessary for one or more of the members of the Board to possess. The nominating and corporate governance committee selects candidates for director based on their character, judgment, diversity of experience, independence, corporate experience, length of service, potential conflicts of interest, and his or her willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties as a director. The nominating and corporate governance committee believes it appropriate for at least one member of the Board to meet the criteria for an audit committee financial expert as defined by SEC rules, and for a majority of the members of the Board to meet the definition of independent director under the rules of the NASDAQ.\n\nPrior to each annual meeting of shareholders, the nominating and corporate governance committee will identify nominees first by reviewing the current directors whose term expires at the annual meeting of shareholders and who are willing to continue in service. These candidates are evaluated based on the criteria described above, including as demonstrated by the candidates prior service as a director, and the needs of the Board with respect to the particular talents and experience of its directors. In the event that a director does not wish to continue in service, the nominating and corporate governance committee determines not to nominate the director, or a vacancy is created on the Board as a result of a resignation, an increase in the size of the Board or other event, the nominating and corporate governance committee will consider various candidates for Board membership, including those suggested by members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, by other members of the Board, by any executive search firm engaged by the nominating and corporate governance committee and by shareholders.\n\nShareholder Nominees. In addition, our articles of association contain provisions that address the process by which a shareholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board at our Annual Meeting of shareholders. In order to nominate a candidate for director, a shareholder must give timely notice in writing to Ambarella, Inc.s Secretary and otherwise comply with the provisions of our articles of association. To be timely, we must have received the shareholders notice not more than 120 days nor less than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the date our proxy statement was provided to shareholders in connection with previous years Annual Meeting. However, if we did not hold an Annual Meeting in the prior year or if the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the prior years Annual Meeting, we must receive the shareholders notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of 90 days prior to the Annual Meeting and the 10th day after the day we provided such public disclosure of the meeting date. Information required by the articles of association to be in the notice include the name and contact information for the candidate and the person making the nomination, the principal occupation or employment of the candidate, the class and number of Ambarella securities held by the candidate, and other information about the nominee that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations under that Section. We received no director nominees from our shareholders.\n\n14\n\nShareholder nominations must be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in, and include the information required by, our articles of association and must be addressed to 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: Secretary. You can obtain a copy of our articles of association by writing to the Secretary at this address.\n\nCommunications with the Board\n\nThe Board has adopted a formal process by which shareholders may communicate with the Board or any of its directors. Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board or an individual director may send a written communication addressed as follows: Ambarella Board Communication, 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, California 95054. Each communication will be reviewed by the General Counsel of Ambarella who will forward the communication to the Board of Directors or to any individual director to whom the communication is addressed unless the communication is of a commercial, frivolous or similarly inappropriate nature, in which case, the General Counsel will discard the communication.\n\nCorporate Governance Principles and Practices\n\nWe believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder. In addition, we believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market.\n\nThe Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to each of our directors, officers and employees. This code addresses various topics, including:\n\n\n\nconflicts of interest;\n\n\n\ninsider trading;\n\n\n\ncorporate opportunities;\n\n\n\ncompetition and fair dealing;\n\n\n\nequal employment and working conditions;\n\n\n\nrecord keeping;\n\n\n\nconfidentiality;\n\n\n\ngiving and accepting gifts;\n\n\n\nselecting suppliers and fostering partnerships;\n\nThe Board also has adopted a Code of Ethics for our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, including our Chief Financial Officer and principal accounting officer, relating to ethical conduct, conflicts of interest and compliance with law. The Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics for our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers is available to shareholders on Ambarellas website at www.ambarella.com. Any waiver to the Code of Business Conduct for an executive officer or director or any waiver of the Code of Ethics may only be granted by the Board or a committee of the Board and must be timely disclosed as required by applicable law. We also have implemented whistleblower procedures that establish formal protocols for receiving and handling complaints from employees. Any concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters reported under these procedures will be communicated promptly to our audit committee.\n\n15\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nFollowing completion of our initial public offering in October 2012, our non-employee directors receive compensation consisting of annual cash retainers for service on the Board and its standing committees, as well as equity grants awarded to non-employee directors upon joining the Board and on an annual recurring basis as they remain a member of the Board.\n\nRetainers. Our non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of $35,000, prorated for partial service in any year and paid in cash. Members of our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee, other than the chairpersons of those committees, receive an additional annual retainer of $10,000, $6,000 and $4,000, respectively. The chairpersons of our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee each receive an additional annual retainer of $15,000, $10,000 and $7,500, respectively and the individual acting as lead independent director, if any, receives an additional $15,000 annually. Cash retainers are paid in arrears at the end of each quarter for service during the previous quarter.\n\nStock Compensation. Our non-employee directors receive grants of nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock unit awards. A non-employee director will be granted an initial nonstatutory option upon first becoming a member of the Board to purchase 13,333 ordinary shares and a restricted stock unit award equal to the value of the initial option grant. The initial option vests and becomes exercisable ratably over four years such that 1/48th of the shares subject to the option vest in equal monthly installments. The initial restricted stock unit award vests ratably on a quarterly basis over four years such that 1/16 of the shares vest each quarterly. Following each annual meeting of the shareholders after the year in which such director is initially elected to the Board, each continuing non-employee director is granted a nonstatutory option to purchase 5,555 ordinary shares and a restricted stock unit award equal to the value of the annual option grant. Each annual grant vests ratably over 12 months, with the option grant vesting in equal monthly installments and the restricted stock unit award vesting in equal quarterly installments.\n\nDirector Compensation for Fiscal 2014\n\nThe following table sets forth the compensation paid or accrued by us to our non-employee directors during fiscal year 2014. The table excludes Mr. Kohn and Dr. Wang, who did not receive any additional compensation from us in their roles as a director because they are employees of Ambarella.\n\nName\n\nFees\n\nEarned or\n\nPaid in\n\nCash ($) Option\n\nAwards\n\n($)(1)(2) Restricted\n\nStock\n\nAwards\n\n($)(1)(3) Total ($)\n\nChenming C.

Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where applicable, Ambarella believes that each of the shareholders named in this table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned.

Mr. Tan, Brian Chiang, Hock Voon Loo and Andrew Kau hold shared voting and investment power with respect to the shares held by Pacven V and affiliated funds, all of whom disclaim beneficial ownership of these shares except to the extent of any pecuniary interest therein. The address for Walden International is One California Street, Suite 2800, San Francisco, CA 94111.

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish Ambarella with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To Ambarellas knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of the reports furnished to Ambarella and written representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, we believe that our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements, except for a transaction that should have been reported on Form 4 by June 26, 2013 for Pacven Walden Management V Co. Ltd. and its affiliated entities, which was actually reported on June 27, 2013, a transaction that should have been reported on Form 4 by December 4, 2013 for Didier LeGall, which was actually reported on December 5, 2013, a transaction that should have been reported on Form 4 by December 13, 2013 for Andrew Verhalen, which was actually reported on December 18, 2013, and a transaction that should have been reported on Form 4 by December 17, 2013 for Lip-Bu Tan, which was actually reported on December 18, 2013.\n\n19\n\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\n\nIn addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the following is a description of each transaction since February 1, 2013 and each currently proposed transaction in which:\n\nIndemnification Agreements with Executive Officers and Directors\n\nAmbarella has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers pursuant to which Ambarella has agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims by reason of their being such a director or officer. These indemnification agreements and Ambarellas memorandum and articles of association will indemnify each of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nLicense Agreements with Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2008, Ambarella entered into several software license agreements with Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence. A member of Ambarellas board of directors, Lip-Bu Tan, is also the Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of Cadence. Ambarellas board of directors has noted that Mr. Tan did not derive any direct or indirect material benefit from such agreements. Ambarella committed to pay $5.1 million payable in 17 quarterly payments through June 2011. In April 2011, Ambarella committed to pay $5.1 million for additional licenses payable in 12 quarterly payments through January 2014.\n\nCode of Conduct Policy and Procedures\n\nIn 2012, Ambarella adopted a formal written policy that became effective upon completion of Ambarellas initial public offering that all executive officers, directors, nominees for election as directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our ordinary shares and any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction in which the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected exceed $120,000 in any calendar year with Ambarella without the prior consent of Ambarellas audit committee, subject to the pre-approval exceptions described below. If advance approval is not feasible then the related party transaction will be considered at the audit committees next regularly scheduled meeting. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, the audit committee is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction. Ambarellas board of directors has delegated to the chair of the audit committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify any request to enter into a transaction with a related party, in which the amount involved is less than $250,000 and where the chair is not the related party. The audit committee has also reviewed certain types of related party transactions that it has deemed pre-approved even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed $120,000 including, employment of executive officers, director compensation, certain transactions with other organizations, certain charitable contributions, transactions where all shareholders receive proportional benefits, transactions involving competitive bids, regulated transactions and certain banking-related services.\n\nThe transactions described above were entered into prior to the adoption of this policy.\n\n20\n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nCompensation Decisions and the Role of the Compensation Committee\n\nThe compensation committee of the Board is currently comprised of three independent, non-employee directors, Andrew W. Verhalen, Chenming C. Hu and Lip-Bu Tan. The compensation committee is responsible for the executive compensation programs for our executive officers and reports to the Board on its discussions, decisions and other actions. Typically, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make recommendations to our compensation committee, attend committee meetings and are involved in the determination of compensation for our executive officers, provided, however, that neither our Chief Executive Officer nor our Chief Financial Officer makes recommendations as to his own compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make recommendations to our compensation committee regarding short- and long-term compensation for our executive officers based on our results, an individual executive officers contribution toward these results and performance toward goal achievement. Our compensation committee then reviews the recommendations and other data and makes recommendations to the Board as to each executive officers total compensation, as well as each individual compensation component. Our compensation committees recommendations regarding executive compensation are based on the compensation committees assessment of the performance of the Company and each individual executive officer, as well as other factors, such as prevailing industry trends. The Board (or the independent members regarding chief executive officer compensation) makes the final decisions regarding executive compensation.\n\nNarrative to Fiscal 2014 Summary Compensation Table\n\nThe primary components of compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers, whom we refer to in this Proxy Statement as the named executive officers, are base salary, cash incentive compensation and equity-based compensation. We do not have a policy on the division of compensation between the primary components. Each of our named executive officers serves on an at-will basis. Their initial base salary is established at the time of hire, and the Board reviews the base salaries annually. With regard to cash incentive compensation, our Board approved the fiscal 2014 cash bonus plan, under which senior management were eligible to receive cash awards upon achievement of certain corporate financial and operational goals. The amounts payable under the annual cash incentive bonus plan are generally calculated as a percentage of the applicable executives base salary. For fiscal years 2013 and 2014, Dr. Wangs target cash bonus was 50% and 75% of his annual base salary, respectively, while each of the other named executive officers has a target cash bonus of 30% of his annual base salary. Finally, with regard to equity-based compensation, our compensation committee meets periodically to discuss and review the level of equity-based compensation, and to decide whether additional option grants or restricted stock awards are necessary.\n\n21\n\nSummary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2014\n\nThe following table shows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 and 2013, compensation awarded to, paid to or earned by Ambarellas Chief Executive Officer and its two other most highly compensated executive officers as of January 31, 2014, which we refer to in this Proxy Statement as our named executive officers:\n\n(1) The dollar amounts in this column do not reflect dollar amounts actually received by our named executive officers. Instead, these amounts represent the aggregate full grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for equity granted during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 and 2012. Stock option awards are valued using the Black Scholes option valuation model and the assumptions outlined in Note 7 of our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on April 4, 2014.\n\n(2) Reflects performance-based cash bonuses paid to our executive officers for performance in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.\n\n(3) Reflects payments made under our patent incentive program.\n\nEquity Incentive Awards\n\nHistorically, equity-based compensation has been our primary long-term incentive compensation component. Our equity-based compensation is intended to retain executive officers through the use of time-based vesting while tying our long-term financial performance and shareholder value creation to the executive officers financial gain. Prior to fiscal year 2013, all equity awards to executive officers, other than initial sales of founder shares to Dr. Wang and Mr. Kohn, were in the form of stock options granted at fair market value with time-based vesting. In fiscal years 2013 and 2014, we granted our executive officers restricted stock unit awards.\n\nGenerally, upon commencement of employment, executives are awarded initial stock option grants carrying a service-based vesting condition, with one-fourth of the shares generally vesting one year from the vesting commencement date and the remaining shares vesting in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months. Historically, our practice has been to review equity awards to existing employees, including our executive officers, after one year of service and annually thereafter and to make additional awards if appropriate. These additional awards to our executive officers generally vest in equal monthly installments over 48 months, subject to continued service. In fiscal year 2014, we granted our executive officers two restricted stock unit awards. One award is subject to time-based vesting and vests in equal quarterly installments over 48 months, subject to continued service. The second restricted stock unit award was subject to the satisfaction of certain corporate performance goals for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. The Board of Directors has determined that the performance goals were satisfied and, these restricted stock unit awards began to vest on March 15, 2014 and will vest in equal quarterly installments over 24 months, subject to continued service.\n\n22\n\nThe following table presents the restricted stock unit awards granted in fiscal year 2014 to our named executive officers:\n\nName\n\nDate of\n\nAward Number of\n\nShares\n\nFeng-Ming (Fermi) Wang\n\n8/27/2013 84,000 3/5/2014 (1) 36,000\n\nGeorge Laplante\n\n8/27/2013 42,000 3/5/2014 (1) 18,000\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n8/27/2013 56,000 3/5/2014 (1) 24,000\n\n(1) Represents a performance-based restricted stock unit award granted on August 27, 2013 and subject to the satisfaction of certain corporate performance goals for the 2014 fiscal year. Following completion of the 2014 fiscal year, the Board of Directors determined that the performance goals were satisfied and, these restricted stock unit awards began to vest on March 15, 2014\n\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\n\nThe following table shows certain information regarding outstanding equity awards held by our named executive officers at the end of fiscal year 2014.\n\nOption Awards Stock Awards\n\nName\n\nNumber of\n\nSecurities\n\nUnderlying\n\nUnexercised\n\nOptions (#)\n\nExercisable(1) Number of\n\nSecurities\n\nUnderlying\n\nUnexercised\n\nOptions (#)\n\nUnexercisable Option\n\nExercise\n\nPrice\n\n($) Option\n\nExpiration\n\nDate Number\n\nof Shares\n\nor Units\n\nof Stock\n\nThat\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n(#) Market\n\nValue of\n\nShares or\n\nUnits of\n\nStock That\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n($)(2)\n\nFeng-Ming (Fermi) Wang\n\n111,111  2.93 7/9/2018 111,110  6.62 10/28/2019 56,943 9,723 (3) 8.82 11/2/2020 26,851 17,593 (4) 8.82 8/29/2021 11,459 (5) 367,032 78,750 (6) 2,522,363 36,000 (7) 1,153,080\n\nGeorge Laplante\n\n118,532 (8)  8.82 3/7/2021 5,369 3,519 (4) 8.82 8/29/2021 7,640 (5) 244,709 39,375 (6) 1,261,181 18,000 (7) 576,540\n\nLeslie Kohn\n\n88,888  2.93 7/9/2018 66,666  3.20 7/8/2019 41,758 7,130 (3) 8.82 11/2/2020 21,480 14,075 (4) 8.82 8/29/2021 8,404 (5) 269,180 52,500 (6) 1,681,575 24,000 (7) 768,720\n\n(1) Vesting of each stock option is contingent upon the executive officers continued service.\n\n(2) The amounts in this column are calculated using a per share value of $32.03, the closing market price of our ordinary shares on January 31, 2014.\n\n23\n\n(3) The shares subject to the stock option vest over a four-year period commencing on August 1, 2010, with 1/48 of the shares vesting on a monthly basis.\n\n(4) The shares subject to the stock option vest over a four-year period commencing on August 1, 2011, with 1/48 of the shares vesting on a monthly basis.\n\n(5) The shares subject to the restricted stock unit grant vest over a four-year period commencing on September 15, 2012, with 1/16 of the shares vesting on a quarterly basis.\n\n(6) The shares subject to the restricted stock unit grant vest over a four-year period commencing on September 15, 2013, with 1/16 of the shares vesting on a quarterly basis.\n\n(7) The shares subject to the restricted stock unit grant vest over a two-year period commencing on March 15, 2014, with 1/8 of the shares vesting on a quarterly basis.\n\n(8) The shares subject to the stock option vest over a four-year period based on a total grant amount of 299,643 shares, with 1/4 of the shares vesting on March 7, 2012, and the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter. The option may be exercised prior to vesting, subject to our right to repurchase any shares that fail to vest prior to a termination of service in accordance with this vesting schedule. As of January 31, 2014, 212,245 of the shares were vested.\n\nBroad Based Employee Benefits\n\nWe believe that establishing competitive benefit packages for our employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, disability, vision, group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, our patent incentive program and our 401(k) plan, in each case on the same basis as other U.S.-based salaried employees. We do not offer club memberships, automobile allowances, tickets to sporting events or concerts or other perquisites to any of our named executive officers as that would be inconsistent with our egalitarian corporate culture.\n\nEmployee Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change In Control\n\nSeverance Arrangements\n\nUpon a termination of a named executive officer by us other than for cause occurring more than three months before or twelve months following a change of control, subject to the execution of a general release of claims, such named executive officer is entitled to:\n\nChange of Control Arrangements\n\nUpon a termination of a named executive officer by us other than for cause or, if such officer resigns for good reason, within three months before or twelve months following a change of control, subject to the execution of a general release of claims, our named executive officers are entitled to:\n\n24\n\nIn addition to the foregoing benefits, our named executive officers would also receive a gross-up payment if such officer is required to pay excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, with the amount of such gross-up payment equal to the amount of excise tax.\n\nFor purposes of the change of control and severance agreements above, the term cause means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the executive officers willful and continued failure to substantially perform the duties of his position (other than failure resulting from the executive officers complete or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness or impairment); (ii) the executive officers willful and continued failure to substantially perform the lawful and specific directives of the board of directors, as reasonably determined by the board of directors (other than failure resulting from the executive officers complete or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness or impairment); (iii) the executive officers willful commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty resulting in, or is likely to result in, material economic or financial injury to us; or (iv) the executive officers willful engagement in illegal conduct that was or is reasonably likely to be materially injurious to us; provided that we have provided to the executive officer any requisite notice in a timely manner and, if permitted to correct the deficiency, the executive officer has failed to do so.\n\nFor purposes of the change of control and severance agreements above, change of control means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of our securities representing 50% or more of the total voting power represented by our then-outstanding voting securities (except that any change in the ownership of our ordinary shares as a result of a private financing that is approved by the Board will not be considered a change of control); (ii) any person acquires more than 50% of the value of our assets over a twelve-month period; (iii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation that would result in our voting securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent at least 50% of the total voting power represented by our voting securities or the voting securities of such surviving entity (or its parent) outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (iv) the replacement of a majority of the Board during any twenty-four month period by directors whose appointment or election is not approved by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election.\n\nFor purposes of the change of control and severance agreements above, good reason means the executive officers voluntary resignation from all positions such officer holds with us, effective within 90 days after the occurrence of: (i) a reduction by us of the executive officers base salary or annual target bonus in effect immediately prior to such reduction (other than reductions in connection with similar percentage reductions imposed on all executive-level employees); (ii) a reduction by us of the executive officers health or welfare benefits in effect immediately prior to such reduction (other than reductions in connection with similar percentage reductions imposed on all executive-level employees); (iii) our requiring the executive officer to move his primary work location to a location that increases his one-way commute by more than 30 miles from our then-current location; (iv) our failure to continue in effect any material compensation or benefit plan or practice in which the executive officer is eligible to participate in immediately prior to the change of control; (v) our failure to obtain the assumption, in all material respects, of the change of control agreement by any of our successors; or, for certain of the executive officers, (vi) a material diminution in such executive officers authority, duties, responsibilities, title or reporting structure; provided that the executive officer must provide written notice to us of the existence of one of these conditions within 60 days after its initial existence, and we must be provided with a period of 30 days during which we may cure the circumstances giving rise to the condition, in which case no good reason will exist.\n\n25\n\nEQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION\n\nThe following table provides certain information with respect to all of Ambarellas equity compensation plans in effect as of January 31, 2014:\n\nPlan Category\n\nNumber of\n\nSecurities to be\n\nIssued upon\n\nExercise of\n\nOutstanding\n\nOptions,\n\nRestricted\n\nStock Units\n\nand Rights Weighted Average\n\nExercise Price of\n\nOutstanding Options\n\nand Rights Number of Securities\n\nRemaining Available\n\nfor Future Issuance\n\nUnder Equity\n\nCompensation Plans\n\n(Excluding Securities\n\nReflected in the first\n\nColumn)\n\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders:\n\n2004 Stock Option Plan(1)\n\n3,197,627 (4) $ 6.02 0\n\n2012 Equity Incentive Plan(2)\n\n1,571,171 (5) $ 13.87 930,732\n\n2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan(3)\n\n 456,410\n\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\n\n \n\nTOTAL:\n\n4,768,798 $ 6.92 1,387,142\n\n(1) Our Board of Directors adopted, and our shareholders approved, the 2004 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan was last amended on August 28, 2012. A total of 3,197,627 ordinary shares are reserved for issuance under the 2004 Plan. As a result of our initial public offering in October 2012 and the adoption of the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan at that time, we no longer grant awards under the 2004 Plan; however, all outstanding options issued pursuant to the 2004 Plan continue to be governed by their existing terms.\n\n(2) Our Board of Directors adopted, and our shareholders approved, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2012 Plan, which became effective in October 2012 in connection with our initial public offering. A total of 1,104,445 ordinary shares were initially authorized for issuance under the 2012 Plan. Shares reserved for issuance under the 2004 Plan that were not subject to outstanding awards at the completion of our initial public offering or which are subject to awards granted under the 2004 Plan and subsequently expire, terminate or are forfeited to us, are added to the 2012 Plan. In addition, the 2012 Plan provides that the number of ordinary shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2014 fiscal year, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 3,500,000 ordinary shares, (ii) four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the outstanding ordinary shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such lesser number of ordinary shares determined by the Board.\n\n(3) Our Board of Directors adopted, and our shareholders approved, the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, which became effective in October 2012 in connection with our initial public offering.

The ESPP provides that the number of ordinary shares available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2014 fiscal year, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 1,500,000 ordinary shares, (ii) one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) of the outstanding ordinary shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such other amount as may be determined by the Board.\n\n(4) Consists of 224,122 shares granted as restricted stock units and options to purchase 2,973,505 shares.\n\n(5) Consists of 1,185,967 shares granted as restricted stock units and options to purchase 385,204 shares.\n\n26\n\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nThe following report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by Ambarella under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThe Audit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving Ambarellas accounting, auditing, financial reporting, internal control and legal compliance functions by approving the services performed by Ambarellas independent accountants and reviewing their reports regarding Ambarellas accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls as set forth in a written charter adopted by the Board. Ambarellas management is responsible for preparing Ambarellas financial statements and the independent registered public accountants are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities by Ambarellas management and the independent registered public accountants.\n\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Ambarellas consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accountants matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended. In addition, the independent registered public accountants provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence) and the Audit Committee and the independent registered public accountants have discussed such accountants independence from Ambarella and its management. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ambarellas internal and independent registered public accountants, with and without management present, their evaluations of Ambarellas internal accounting controls and the overall quality of Ambarellas financial reporting.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in Ambarellas Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, for filing with the SEC.\n\nChristopher B. Paisley (Chairman)\n\nChenming C. Hu\n\nD. Jeffrey Richardson\n\n27\n\nPROPOSAL 2\n\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Ambarellas independent registered public accounting firm, or independent auditors, for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015, and has further directed that management submit the appointment of independent auditors for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited Ambarellas financial statements since fiscal year 2007. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n\nNeither Ambarellas Articles of Association nor other governing documents or law require shareholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Ambarellas independent auditors. However, the Audit Committee is submitting the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of Ambarella and its shareholders.\n\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to the shareholders and will have the same effect as negative votes.\n\nPRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\n\nThe following table represents aggregate fees billed to Ambarella by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively:\n\n(1) Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 and 2013 were for professional services rendered for the audits of our consolidated financial statements, statutory audits of our subsidiaries, the review of our interim consolidated financial statements, services rendered in connection with registration statements on Form S-8, comfort letters and other matters related to the SEC, and for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 included services rendered in connection with a registration statements on Form S-1 related to our initial public offering.\n\n(2) Audit-Related Fees. For the year ended January 31, 2014, the aggregate fees were for professional services for review of our implementation of our enterprise resource planning system.\n\n(3) Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 were for tax advisory and tax compliance services related to tax research and tax planning services in foreign countries in which we do business.\n\n28\n\n(4) All Other Fees consists of fees for access to online accounting and tax research software applications and data.\n\nAll fees described above were approved by the Audit Committee.\n\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\n\nThe Audit Committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The policy generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committees approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditors or on an individual, explicit, case-by-case basis before the independent auditor is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Audit Committees members, but the decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of the services described above by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is compatible with maintaining the principal accountants independence.\n\nVote Required\n\nRatification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and voting at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted FOR ratification of the appointment. In the event ratification is not obtained, the Audit Committee will review its future appointment of our independent registered public accountants.\n\nThe Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.\n\n29\n\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\n\nIf a shareholder wishes to present a proposal to be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proponent and the proposal must comply with the proxy proposal submission rules of the SEC. One of the requirements is that the proposal be received by the Secretary no later than February 1, 2015. Proposals we receive after that date will not be included in the Proxy Statement. We urge shareholders to submit proposals by Certified MailReturn Receipt Requested.\n\nA shareholder proposal not included in our proxy statement for the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be ineligible for presentation at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders unless the shareholder gives timely notice of the proposal in writing to the Secretary of Ambarella at the principal executive offices of Ambarella. Under our articles of association, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a shareholder, timely notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, us not more than one hundred twenty (120) days nor less than ninety (90) days in advance of the one-year anniversary of the date of our proxy statement provided in connection with the previous years Annual Meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that we did not hold an Annual Meeting in the prior year or if the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the prior years Annual Meeting, we must receive the shareholders notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of 90 days prior to the Annual Meeting and the 10th day after the day we provided such public disclosure of the meeting date.\n\nThe shareholders notice must set forth, as to each proposed matter, the following: (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (b) the name and address, as they appear on our books, of the shareholder proposing such business; (c) the class and number of shares of our securities that are beneficially owned by the shareholder; (d) any material interest of the shareholder in such business; and (e) any other information that is required to be provided by such shareholder pursuant to our articles of association or the proxy proposal submission rules of the SEC.

Request SEC Release No. 34-40018, May 21, 1998.\n\n30\n\nHOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS\n\nTo reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to shareholders who may have more than one account holding ordinary shares of Ambarella but who share the same address, we have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called householding. Under this procedure, certain shareholders of record who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of our proxy materials until such time as one or more of these shareholders notifies us that they want to receive separate copies. This procedure reduces duplicate mailings and saves printing costs and postage fees, as well as natural resources. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions.\n\nIf you receive a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding, and you would like to have separate copies of our annual report or proxy statement mailed to you or if you receive multiple copies and would like to receive a single copy, please submit a request to Corporate Secretary, Ambarella, Inc., 3101 Jay Street, Santa Clara, California 95054 or make a request by e-mail at ir@ambarella.com, and we will promptly send you what you have requested.
