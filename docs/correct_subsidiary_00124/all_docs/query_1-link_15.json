        "text": "Chip maker LSI Logic Corp. has agreed to buy digital video and audio chip maker C-Cube Microsystems Inc. for $878-million (U.S.) in stock, aiming to strengthen its multimedia entertainment business. In the transaction, C-Cube stockholders will exchange each of their shares for 0.79 of an LSI share. The deal values each C-Cube share at about $16.35, representing an 86-per-cent premium to C-Cube's closing stock price on Friday of $8.81. LSI forecast that the deal will begin to add to its earnings this year. C-Cube's chips help to send video and other information through set-top boxes that are connected to the Internet. Both companies are based in Milpitas, Calif."
