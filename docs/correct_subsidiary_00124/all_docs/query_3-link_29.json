        "text": "10\n\nConclusions\n\nWe believe that the alliance boom is clearly going to continue into the foreseeable future—until the computer and semiconductor industries pass their peaks of maturity and enter the stage of downward decline; even then, incentives to form alliances will remain strong. As long as the underlying forces identified in Chapters 3–5 are unchanged, the growth of American-Japanese alliances will not slow. Indeed, as foreign markets expand, commercial pressures to form alliances with companies in many different foreign countries will arise. The world semiconductor industry will see more alliances concluded between American and European firms, between Asian and American companies, and between European and Japanese corporations. In addition to the usual bilateral alliances, the number of trilateral and multilateral tie-ups is bound to increase.\n\nAs sites of the two largest semiconductor industries, linkages between the United States and Japan will probably continue to constitute the bulk of international marriages. Alliances between U.S. and Asian companies will extend beyond the United States and Japan to include new players in Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea, which now have significant capabilities in semiconductor production. Just as the types of alliance have become more varied over time, so too will the number and nationalities of corporate participants. Strategic alliances will therefore continue to function as the most important mechanism for technology transfer in the semiconductor industry well into the next century.\n\nEXAMPLES OF U.S.-JAPAN ALLIANCES: ASSESSING COSTS AND BENEFITS\n\nTo assess the costs and benefits of alliances, it is necessary to look in some detail at specific examples. A number of examples of U.S.-Japan semiconductor alliances are treated in this report. In Appendix A, three cases are described in detail: Motorola-Toshiba, Sun Microsystems-Fujitsu, and Kubota's series of alliances with U.S. semiconductor and computer companies. Other examples are described less extensively in the section on asymmetrical pairings (Power Integrations-Matsushita, TriQuint's difficulty in forming a satisfactory alliance, and nCHIP-Sumitomo Metal and Mining) or symmetrical pairings (LSI Logic-Kawasaki Steel). Finally, in Chapter 8, examples of alliances are used to illustrate the trouble U.S. start-up companies in semiconductor equipment and materials have in attracting capital and the implications of computer industry trends for the semiconductor industry.\n\nTogether, the cases and examples are representative of the broad range of partnering firms, motivations, and mechanisms that characterize U.S.-Japan semiconductor alliances. Motorola-Toshiba is a large U.S. company-large Japanese company alliance that includes a variety of mechanisms, such as licensing, a manufacturing joint venture, joint product development, and marketing cooperation. Sun-Fujitsu is a small (at the time the alliance was formed) U.S. company-large Japanese semiconductor company linkage that centers on a supplier-manufacturer relationship comprising licensing, consigned product development, and manufacturing foundry aspects. The Kubota case illustrates the variety of mechanisms that a large Japanese company can use to partner with small U.S. firms in support of an effort to enter the semiconductor and information industries laterally. The examples of asymmetrical alliances describe the considerations of U.S. start-up companies in forming alliances with large Japanese companies.\n\nGaps in the representativeness of these examples are generally in areas that are important but have a limited number of examples. One fairly new type of alliance that is not included is licensing of Japanese product technology to U.S. firms. NEC and Mitsubishi Electric have licensed products to AT&T, but this pattern is still unusual. A large-scale collaborative product development effort is another type of alliance not covered in detail here, but Texas Instruments-Hitachi is perhaps the only alliance that fits this category.38 Large government-sponsored R&D consortia, such as Japan's Very Large Scale Integration Project and SEMATECH in the United States,\n\nare not discussed because international participation has been rare until now. However, U.S.-Japan collaboration through this mechanism is a possibility for the future, because the Japanese government has been opening consortia to foreign participation and is currently planning to launch several new semiconductor-related projects.\n\nA closer look at alliances that have failed would also have been useful. The historical background contained in the Motorola-Toshiba case study does describe the dead ends that Motorola has encountered, but a detailed treatment of the Motorola-Hitachi or Intel-NEC alliances and the reasons they ended in court might be illuminating in light of the fact that U.S. companies such as Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun are bringing a new generation of RISC microprocessors to market and licensing them to a variety of Japanese and U.S. companies. It is generally quite difficult to get access to information about U.S.-Japan alliances that have failed, particularly those that are currently under litigation.\n\nWhat do these examples tell us about the costs and benefits to U.S. companies and industry of alliances with Japanese firms? Is the calculus different today than it was during the period prior to the 1980s, when American firms traded short-term income flows for technology that enabled the Japanese to build a world-class semiconductor industry? It is safe to say that the calculus is much more complicated today. A review of the experiences contained in our examples suggests conclusions about the overall costs and benefits from the U.S. perspective.\n\nCosts\n\nCosts of U.S.-Japan alliances can be divided into those incurred by the company that forms the alliance and those incurred by industry, including the upstream and downstream industries for which semiconductor companies are important customers and suppliers, as well as semiconductor manufacturers themselves. For individual companies, perhaps the biggest potential cost is creating a formidable competitor through technology transfer. For U.S. industry as a whole, the loss of semiconductor manufacturing capability and infrastructure resulting from a pattern of alliances may be the most serious potential cost.\n\nTransferring Enabling Technology: Perhaps the most important technical area of the semiconductor industry in which Japanese firms are still behind the United States is the design of software codes that are embodied in advanced microprocessors. Possession of this capability would allow Japanese companies to challenge U.S. industry in its most important stronghold, and would create new competitors for a wide range of U.S. semiconductor and systems companies. The Sun-Fujitsu alliance, the Motorola-Toshiba alliance, and the Kubota-MIPS alliance involved the transfer\n\nof microprocessor technology. In these cases it has been a number of years since the transfer took place. The Japanese partners have yet to forge ahead and become world leaders in microprocessors.\n\nIt appears that in general, Japanese firms are still working to acquire the necessary software skill base. As described in Chapter 8, microprocessing unit markets are affected by the complex interaction of compatibility, the need to have a base of applications software that can be run on an MPU, and the possibility of technical discontinuities that can quickly change the shape of particular markets (RISC). Japan's underdeveloped personal computer market is an obvious disadvantage to acquiring a critical mass of skills. The creation of competition in this area appears to be only a potential cost for U.S. companies today.\n\nHowever, industry trends toward open systems may reduce the importance of proprietary MPU architectures (see discussion of downstream trends in Chapter 8). If this is the case, then the lack of capability to design superior MPUs would be less of a hurdle for Japanese companies seeking to compete in systems markets, particularly if they control the manufacture of critical components and possess sufficient marketing capability. The MPUs licensed by Sun and MIPS to Fujitsu and Kubota have allowed the Japanese partners to build manufacturing and marketing capability in advanced work-stations and supercomputers. Thus far, the critical importance of MPU designs has enabled the U.S. partners to ''manage\" these relationships, but there is no guarantee that Japanese firms will fail to acquire the skills necessary to design MPUs or that MPUs will not decline in importance—to the benefit of Japanese companies—in the future.\n\nTransferring Incremental Technology: The costs incurred from transferring incremental technology are less severe than those incurred by transferring enabling technology. There are no examples in this report of such costs having actually been incurred. Kubota's investment in C-Cube Micro-systems and their joint development of video compression technology is, however, an example of technology transfer in an area that may have large potential in the long-term, potential that Kubota is now positioned to exploit. From the U.S. standpoint, transferring the capability to develop emerging markets is an opportunity cost, yet assessing the risk in advance is inherently difficult. The actual cost depends on the technology or product achieving greater market success than predicted at the time it was licensed or acquired.\n\nSome American critics of U.S.-Japan semiconductor alliances say that they are partly responsible for progress made by Japanese companies in markets such as gate arrays and ASICs. Perhaps the most notable example from the past that fits this general category is liquid crystal display (LCD) technology, which was developed in the United States but which Japanese companies continue to develop and commercialize. The potential market for displays in all sorts of portable information processing and consumer\n\nelectronics products is enormous. The Power Integrations case is a good example of how it is increasingly possible for U.S. companies to control their technology and avoid this risk, at least in areas where the potential for a technology can be reasonably gauged. Because it has a good patent position and the courts are more inclined to protect intellectual property rights than they have been in the past, Power Integrations was able to structure an alliance in which it receives a royalty from Matsushita for internal use of the power management technology. Matsushita may be able to develop improvements on this technology that it could then utilize, but Power Integrations can keep Matsushita from selling these improvements outside (or license and incorporate them into the product) as long as the original patents remain in force.39 Power Integrations takes some risk, but has a better chance of being able to sustain product development and stay in the race for incremental improvements of its technology.\n\nLow Return on Resources Expended: Low return on expenditures is a short-and long-term cost that has been incurred by U.S. companies trying to break into the Japanese market. Despite the long-term organizational learning benefits described below, the Motorola-Alps joint venture is a clear example of costs incurred in attempting to break into the Japanese market. In that case, Motorola attempted to use an alliance to enter the market and avoid enabling a long-term competitor or incurring the technology transfer-related costs outlined above. Motorola finally had to give up technology to Toshiba in order to gain significant access to the Japanese market, and it has tried to structure the relationship to minimize the risk of long-term costs. The difficulty of selling in Japan has imposed long-term costs on the American semiconductor industry and may still discourage U.S. firms from investing in Japanese marketing and the technology development capability that will be necessary for long-term growth and survival.\n\nUnsuccessful Licensing Alliances: Unsuccessful licensing alliances occur when a Japanese company uses the technology in a way that makes the American company believe the agreement is being violated. Even apart from the issue of fault in a legal sense, it is safe to say that the licensing firm in this situation regrets granting a license and typically sues. This is a short-term technology risk as opposed to the first three costs because licensing agreements that have succeeded over several years are less likely to turn acrimonious. The Motorola-Hitachi case is referred to in this report, but there is no detailed treatment of this type of case here. Two additional points should be made: (1) This risk can be incurred in licensing to Amer-\n\nJapan. Sun gained better access to the Japanese workstation market by linking with Fujitsu. Motorola has gained better access to the semiconductor market by linking with Toshiba. The Power Integrations-Matsushita and nCHIP-Sumitomo Metals alliances show promise for delivering market access to the U.S. partner on better terms than would have been possible 10 years ago. These alliances demonstrate that it is often necessary to trade technology for access, but a presence in the Japanese market is increasingly essential for long-term survival and growth in the semiconductor industry and in the upstream and downstream industries to which it is linked.\n\nFreedom to Focus Resources on High-Return Activities: The Sun-Fujitsu case illustrates another benefit: rather than invest in semiconductor manufacturing, Sun was able to focus on building marketing resources and on designing the next-generation SPARC chip, which will be on sale soon. The opportunity costs and risks associated with not manufacturing, which are covered above, must be balanced against this concrete, short-and medium-term benefit.\n\nOrganizational Learning: Learning accrues to U.S. companies that use their alliances to build a capability for extracting benefits from their technical, marketing, and manufacturing activities in Japan, whether or not these activities specifically involve alliances. Motorola is a good example. The experience that Motorola has gained at considerable expense through its alliances and other long-term efforts can be utilized in the service of long-term strategic objectives. The benefits of possessing this capability can extend beyond the semiconductor industry. For example, Motorola's telecommunications equipment business is affected by government regulation, and knowledge of Japanese government operations and key officials will be useful to the company in advancing its interests in Japan's regulatory and policy spheres.\n\nEvaluating these costs and benefits in individual cases is an extremely complex undertaking, but several generalizations can be drawn from the examples covered in this report. From the U.S. perspective, the costs of U.S.-Japan semiconductor alliances are largely—but not exclusively—long-term, potential, and difficult to quantify. Further, if the most serious costs were incurred, they would fall on actors and interests external to the company forming the alliance and would be borne in a manner that is impossible to predict. By contrast, the benefits from U.S.-Japan alliances are often more immediate, concrete, easy to quantify, and directly appropriable by the U.S. company that forms the alliance. American-Japanese alliances, like other business relationships, generally involve both risks and benefits, and require continuous adaptation to new circumstances.\n\nOver time, the \"terms of trade\" in semiconductor alliances appear to be improving for U.S. participants. It is now possible to gain valuable resourc-\n\nes, such as investment capital, access to the Japanese market, and manufacturing services and know-how. The key factors that contribute to greater bargaining power for U.S. companies are (1) competition among larger firms seeking an alliance and (2) strong intellectual property protection.\n\nIn making U.S. investments, Japanese companies have consciously steered away from the strategy of leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers. Self-interest and the near absence of hostile takeovers in corporate Japan explain this circumspect approach; engaging in leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers would surely ignite outrage in the United States.\n\nAlthough the record of the past illustrates significant costs associated with U.S.-Japan strategic alliances, the context is changing and the examples in this report illustrate that in some cases, tangible benefits accrue to both sides. It will be important for U.S. policymakers, the American semiconductor industry, and other analysts to continue to monitor the mechanisms and impacts of U.S.-Japan strategic alliances, to assimilate experience, and to consider changes in public policy and corporate strategy where appropriate. The U.S. government and industry need to create an environment in which American firms have sufficient bargaining power in forming alliances, and the necessary information base must be developed to take full advantage of the possible benefits.\n\nSEMICONDUCTORS AS A STRATEGIC INDUSTRY\n\nStrategic alliances constitute an important—perhaps the most important—mechanism for semiconductur technology transfer between the United States and Japan. Although these alliances are normally seen as instruments of technology transmission, they also reflect deep-seated forces at work within the two economies. We believe that it is unrealistic to expect alliances to correct structural deficiencies in America's own manufacturing infrastructure (even though U.S. companies ought to insist on a reverse flow of manufacturing know-how from Japan to strengthen the U.S. infrastructure); nor is it realistic to expect alliances to change the short-term time horizons of U.S. management. Strategic alliances are manifestations of underlying conditions, not the root cause of what ails the U.S. semiconductor industry.\n\nIn part, the erosion of U.S. manufacturing capabilities is a reflection of changing comparative advantage and the attractiveness of shifting into the higher value-added segments of the semiconductor industry—specifically into software, microprocessors, and customized or semicustomized areas. Whether it makes long-term sense for the U.S. semiconductor industry as a whole to abandon mass manufacturing in stepping up the ladder of value added is cause for concern. Can commodity markets be abandoned without\n\nof benefits in return (through technology transfer to the United States or the enhancement of a U.S. company's market position in Japan).\n\nThe working group believes that the semiconductor industry, a vital upstream segment of the crucial information industries, is a ''strategic industry\" essential to the nation's well being. The reasons and criteria for labeling semiconductors a strategic industry, though seldom spelled out, are (1) the importance of semiconductor components for superior performance in military hardware; (2) the centrality of semiconductor technology for achieving breakthroughs in computers and information-based high technology; (3) the broad range and versatility of semiconductor applications for large end user industries, including automobiles and the service sector; and (4) the pivotal position of the semiconductor industry in the system of institutions and practices underlying America's capacity to innovate—employment, manufacturing infrastructure, R&D, graduate training, and so forth. The case for semiconductors rests on nothing less than their importance in maintaining America's capacity to innovate and commercialize technology—and all that this implies for military, industrial, and technological leadership.\n\nStrategic importance is time bound. No designation is immutable, and in the case of semiconductors, the leeway to undergo continuous technological change, permitting major new product breakthroughs in computers, telecommunications, and consumer electronics, is not going to last forever. If and when the technological and commercial growth trajectories level off or fall, the rationale for calling semiconductors \"strategic\" will disappear. For the moment, however, and into the foreseeable future, the case is compelling.\n\nBecause the semiconductor industry is strategic, a number of imperatives should be considered by the industry, government, and universities.\n\nIt is essential that the United States maintain a strong, efficient, and world-competitive semiconductor industry.\n\nTo remain a world-class competitor, the U.S. semiconductor industry needs to maintain the full complement of capabilities, including leading-edge R&D, fabrication, equipment making, manufacturing, some testing and assembly, marketing, and servicing.\n\nAmerican producers must not abandon key product markets with respect to technology (such as mask alignment) or revenue flow (e.g., DRAMs and microprocessors).\n\nSince volume production and sales across a number of product markets will separate the front-runners from the rest of the pack, the U.S. semiconductor industry cannot afford to rely exclusively on the computer industry to drive its growth; it must also ride the wave of growth in consumer\n\nhow, and resources—instead of serving primarily as conduits for technology transfer to Japan—the long-term interests of both countries will be served.\n\nThe role of strategic alliances has grown enormously over the past decade and will continue to increase. Whether or not such alliances expand the overall pie and lead to an equitable distribution of benefits depends largely on the ability of the participants to make the most out of them. Their success will have important implications not only for the participants but also for the technology base, the economic well being, and the national security of the United States as a country."
