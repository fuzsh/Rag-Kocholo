        "text": "LSI Logic Corp., Milpitas, Calif., has agreed to acquire chip maker C-Cube Microsystems Inc., in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $878 million. LSI Logic said it expects to complete the transaction in June.\n\nWith both companies focused on advances in computer chips and silicon necessary for compression to facilitate interactive on-screen display, the merger could speed the development and time to market of set-top boxes and cable modems with downloadable software applications. Executives for both companies stated that the new combination will enable the pairing of LSI's digital video products-such as encoders and codecs-with C-Cube's decoder technology.\n\nLSI Chairman and CEO Wilfred J. Corrigan said there will be minimal overlap in products and no layoffs are expected. He added that acquiring C-Cube allows LSI Logic to further target the satellite, terrestrial and DSL markets and \"gives us immediate entry in to the U.S and European cable markets.\"\n\nC-Cube, which reported $265 million in revenues in 2000, employs nearly 600 worldwide and is also headquartered in Milpitas. Its customers include Sony, Samsung, LG Electronics, JVC, Motorola, Pace and Philips."
