Commission File No.:333-58862 LSI Logic Reports First Quarter 2001 Revenues and Profits - First Quarter Revenues of $517 million. - Net income EBG* of $9.5 million. - Diluted per share EBG of 3 cents; compared to First Call consensus estimate of 3 cents. - Cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion. * Earnings before goodwill amortization and other special items. LSI Logic Takes Steps to Reduce Expenditures and Enhance Competitive Position For Future Growth MILPITAS, Calif., April 24 /PRNewswire Interactive News Release/ -- LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today reported 2001 first quarter revenues of $517 million, a 31 percent decrease from the $751 million reported in the fourth quarter, and 16 percent lower than the $615 million recorded in the first quarter of 2000. First quarter 2001 net income, before amortization of goodwill and other special items (EBG), was $9.5 million or 3 cents a diluted share, compared to $116 million or 34 cents a diluted share in the fourth quarter, and $88 million or 26 cents a diluted share in the first quarter of 2000. "Our first quarter financial results were impacted by the abrupt decline of the U.S. economy, weakened end-demand and the widespread accumulation of inventory in the supply chain," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic chairman and chief executive officer. "While our visibility is limited, there are indicators that point to the resumption of revenue growth in the second half of the year." "We announced an accretive transaction to acquire C-Cube Microsystems to expand our position in global communications and consumer markets. We signed a process technology collaboration agreement with TSMC, allowing us to more rapidly deliver advanced products to the marketplace and to reduce our development costs. We also announced the closure of our Colorado Springs facility, consolidating our manufacturing to our world-class Gresham and Tsukuba fabs. LSI Logic will compete from a position of strength when the industry rebounds with leading-edge technology for the communications, storage and consumer markets." Bryon Look, LSI Logic executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company will take a $120 million to $150 million charge for fixed asset write-downs, severance, direct exit costs and other expenses associated with the August closure of the company's Colorado Springs manufacturing facility. The restructuring charge will be incurred in the second quarter, and other related charges will be recorded in the second and third quarters of 2001. "LSI Logic has responded aggressively to rapidly changing economic conditions," said Look. "We have taken action to reduce expenditures, invest in our future and strengthen our balance sheet. We are prepared for the anticipated resumption of growth in our targeted vertical markets." LSI Logic also learned today that the Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act with respect to its exchange offer for all of the outstanding shares of C-Cube common stock. In addition, LSI Logic anticipates that its registration statement filed in connection with the exchange offer will be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission 1. 2 on April 26. The exchange offer commenced on April 13, and is scheduled to expire at midnight EDT on May 10, unless extended. LSI Logic Business Outlook LSI Logic expects 2001 Q2 revenues to decline approximately 10-15 percent sequentially from the $517 million reported in the first quarter. The company anticipates reporting a second quarter loss of 7 cents a diluted share on an EBG basis. Second quarter gross margin is expected to be approximately 38 percent. The company does not anticipate selling any equity investments in the second quarter. The 2001 tax rate is expected to be 25 percent. Capital spending for 2001 is anticipated to be approximately $500 million. Second quarter depreciation is projected to be about $99 million.
