        "text": "''WHY did I pick this movie?'' Wes Anderson asked himself, slouching against the wall in the glass-lined lobby of an office building on the Paramount Pictures lot, a sultry black-and-white portrait of Dorothy Lamour peering over his shoulder. ''I don't actually have an answer for that.''\n\nMr. Anderson, it turns out, is the sort of person who tells you -- a little sheepishly -- that he has no answer to something, and then spends the next two and a half hours giving you one.\n\nA slanted, self-deprecating smile spread across his face. Tall, bony and professorial, he leaned his forehead down so that he had to tilt his eyes up a bit to look straight ahead. ''One thing is, I'm a big Fran√ßois Truffaut fan and this is the most unpretentious movie that I can possibly imagine,'' said Mr. Anderson, 32.\n\nHe is referring to ''L'Argent de Poche'' -- or ''Small Change,'' as it was released in the United States in 1976 (some other English-speaking countries saw it as ''Pocket Money'') -- a short, gentle and studiously improvisational comedy about schoolchildren in a small French town. The documentarylike ensemble piece, teeming with life, arrived amid one of the most fertile periods in Truffaut's career.\n\n''It almost looks like the kind of movie that would be projected on a 16-millimeter projector in a school library, or something like that,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''And also, there's something about the fact that I am about the exact age as a lot of the kids in the movie. Even though it's taking place in France and I grew up in Houston, it's my exact childhood period.''\n\nIn less time than it took a director like, say, Stanley Kubrick to make just one movie, Mr. Anderson burst out of the energetic Texas film community with the cult favorite ''Bottle Rocket,'' first a short film in 1994 and then a feature in 1996. He followed it with a second Houston-based comedy, the widely celebrated ''Rushmore'' (1998), and then assembled one of the best casts in a recent American film -- Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, etc. -- to make his latest film, ''The Royal Tenenbaums.'' Along the way he also helped turn two of his closest childhood friends, the brothers Luke and Owen Wilson, into bona fide movie stars.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
