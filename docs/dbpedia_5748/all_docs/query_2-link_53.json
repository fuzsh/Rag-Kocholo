        "text": "But the most notable song featured in the movie is Natasha Bedingfield's 2004 hit Unwritten, which we discover is Powell's character Ben's 'serenity song' when Sweeney's Bea accidentally overhears him listening to it during an awkward moment on a flight.\n\nThe song makes a couple of other appearances during the runtime – including in an infectious credits scene – and Gluck revealed during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter why he decided to opt for it as a centrepiece for the soundtrack.\n\n\"There was debate in my head between that song and another song, and the song... had to have baggage, and maybe people don’t like it, but really, people do love it,\" he explained.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"I just needed to give them permission to love it, which is what I did in another movie [Easy A] with another [Bedingfield] song [Pocketful of Sunshine].\n\n\"But when I started playing [Unwritten] and the other song for people, I very quickly realised that everyone knows [Unwritten]. No matter how snarky or how much of a curmudgeon someone might be, you can’t not love that song... So I hope it comes back again, which I’m sure it will after this.\"\n\nRead on for the full list of tracks featured in Anyone But You, as well as the score.\n\nAnyone But You soundtrack\n\nThe full list of songs featured in the soundtrack can be found below:\n\nDidn't I performed by Darondo\n\nThe Spins performed by Mac Miller\n\nPhoto ID (with Dominic Fike) performed by Remi Wolf, Dominic Fike\n\nUnwritten performed by Natasha Bedingfield\n\nSick performed by Dominic Fike\n\nThe Vacationer performed by Hungry Kids of Hungary\n\nBang Bang performed by Hippo Campus\n\nSteppin’ On Me performed by Fitz and The Tantrums\n\nSympathy performed by Declan McKenna\n\nDummy performed by Portugal.
