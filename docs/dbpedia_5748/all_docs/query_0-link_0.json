        "meta_description": "The entertaining documentary I'M NO DUMMY is the essential guide to the modern venting revival and brings us into that surprising world of comedy and much more.  A funny exploration of modern ventriloquism, it illustrates the hilarity and magic of 'venting' while celebrating the renewed popularity of the art.\r\n\r\nSome of the most renowned, modern masters guide us along the way. Jeff Dunham (two-time Comedian of the Year), Jay Johnson (Broadway's Tony AwardÂ® winner and veteran of TV's beloved classic SOAP), and Lynn Trefzger (Campus Entertainer of the Year) are all featured in the film. Noted 'vent' historian Tom Ladshaw provides insight and perspective, making clear that ventriloquism is not your grandfather's novelty act, but a dynamic performance art of the highest level.  The film provides a rare window into the delightful inventiveness and creative drive that lets ventriloquists do what they do while keeping the art form fresh.\r\n\r\nThe first disc of this two disc set includes the complete film, a director's commentary, two Q & A's with the filmmakers from the World Premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival, a special interview with Jeff Dunham and his vintage figure Skinny Duggan as well as English and Spanish subtitles.\r\n\r\nThe second disc has two hours of previously unseen outtakes and interview material and comic performances as well as an added interview from AMERICA'S GOT TALENT winner and Las Vegas headliner Terry Fator. It also takes a fantastic peek inside the Vent Haven Museum, the only museum in the world dedicated to the art of ventriloquism.",
