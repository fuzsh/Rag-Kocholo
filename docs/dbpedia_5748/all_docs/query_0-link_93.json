        "text": "Hello, here we are once again, and welcome to the glitziest most star studded edition of the Pilton Palais Film Festival, ever.

Our Saturday night film is also part of our Vampire series with a Q&A from Tilda Swinton talking about Jim Jarmusch’s insanely cool vampire film Only Lovers left Alive. Fun fact: Tilda’s part in this film qualified her for her cameo in the hit TV series What We do in the Shadows. Finally, on Sunday, we kick off with I’m not There, a rumination on the life of Bob Dylan, where six characters embody different aspect of the musician’s life and work. Cate Blanchett is one of those six, and the two-time Oscor winner will be with us for the Q&A.

Then on Thursday we come bang up to date with Abigail, a film made by Radio Silence Productions who are known for the horror films Ready or Not, Scream and Scream VI, a mix of gore and crowd-pleasing horror. On Saturday we are blessed with having the star of the film Tilda Swinton, before the screening of Only Lovers Left Alive, a wonderful noir comedy film, filled with some breath-taking night-time scenery, superb acting a charismatic script, an experience that simply cannot be missed. Sunday late afternoon we are screening Murnau’s 1922 silent movie Nosferatu which is arguably the film that gave birth to the horror genre. Introduced by Ali Plumb and enthusiast of the genre, Dan Smith from the band Bastille. The film will be brought alive by a modern live re-score played by live by Chris Green. The mini season wraps up with, our closing film this year on Sunday night with the 2014 film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. A beautiful genre-busting movie filmed in Persian language on location in the Californian desert, written and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour. The film is described as “The first Iranian vampire Western”, a perfect vampire flick with a killer soundtrack. From the western stylings of Oregon band Federale, whose compositions are meant to evoke memories of Ennio Morricone-scored westerns, to Iranian rock bands Radio Tehran and Kiosk.
