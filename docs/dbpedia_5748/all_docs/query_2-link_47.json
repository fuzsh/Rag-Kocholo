        "text": "With the SAG-AFTRA strike officially gone like the wind, it’s time to get back to work on set.\n\nThe 118-day protest caused some films across Hollywood to delay their release dates, but not to worry, they’ll hit the silver screen at some point.\n\nMarvel’s “Deadpool 3” will now open on July 26, 2024, instead of May 3, 2024.\n\nThe fourth “Captain America” flick, titled “Brave New World,” will now debut on Feb. 14, 2025 — and not in July 2024 as previously planned.\n\nSuperhero film “Thunderbolts” was first set to fly into cinemas on Dec. 20, 2024, but has been pushed to July 25, 2025.\n\nAnother feature movie on Marvel’s roster, Mahershala Ali’s “Blade,” has moved to Nov. 7, 2025, after previously being slated for a Valentine’s Day 2025 release.\n\nSony’s “Venom 3” starring Tom Hardy is also now set for November 8, 2024.\n\nAfter the strike’s end, “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds tweeted on X to let fans know that the third installment would be ready for next summer.\n\nAlongside a hilarious photo of “Dogpool” — the puppy version of the Marvel antihero — the Canadian actor, 47, wrote: “Did Dogpool save the day? Not a chance in gremlin hell. But she IS currently causing the Disney plushy merch department nightmares. Coming with the movie, Summer 2024.”\n\nHugh Jackman will be reprising his longtime role as Wolverine in “Deadpool 3.”\n\nThe “Logan” star, 55, shared a first look at himself rocking the classic yellow costume of the metal-clawed mutant on social media in July.\n\nHe shared a pic of himself on his Instagram Stories alongside a red suit-clad Reynolds. “Don’t blink,” the caption read.\n\nThe Aussie actor revealed earlier this year why he decided to finally return to his action roots and how the “Change-Up” star consistently begged him to make an appearance in the upcoming film.\n\n“I wasn’t tortured by it. When people would ask me [to reprise the role] — including Ryan, every five seconds, I was like: ‘I’m done,’” Jackman told The Guardian.\n\n“[I] just wanted to do it and I felt it in my gut,” he added of transforming into the Wolverine once again. He then quipped: “I get to punch the s–t out of Ryan Reynolds every day.”\n\nShawn Levy will be directing “Deadpool 3.” Last month, he played coy about rumors on whether Taylor Swift would be making a cameo appearance as the hero Dazzler."
