        "text": "There are a lot of movies about journalism. A lot more than you might think. And most of them, actually, are quite good.\n\nIt’s not like sports. For every sports classic such as “Hoosiers” or “Raging Bull” or “Bull Durham,” there’s a dog like “Caddyshack 2” or “Rocky V” or “Blades of Glory.”\n\nThis isn’t like movies about presidents. For every “Lincoln,” there’s an “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.”\n\nMost journalism movies, even the ones that aren’t exactly like the day-to-day lives of flesh-and-blood journalists, are still pretty entertaining. Many perfectly capture the journalistic experience.\n\nThat’s why coming up with a list of the 25 best-ever movies about journalism was not easy. Yet, we’re confident in our selections. So grab your popcorn and take in our 25 Greatest Movies About Journalism.\n\n25. Almost Famous (2000)\n\nTeenager William Miller tricks Rolling Stone into believing he’s a veteran rock writer and, after some advice from legendary music writer Lester Bangs, he hits the road with a band called Stillwater and a groupie (sorry, I mean “band-aid”) named Penny Lane — and his career is born. Loosely based on the experience of writer and director Cameron Crowe.\n\n24. The Parallax View (1974)\n\nTwo years before he directed “All the President’s Men,” Alan J. Pakula released this thriller about a reporter, played by Warren Beatty, investigating a secret organization that specializes in political assassination. Somehow, this movie has gotten better with time.\n\n23. Frost/Nixon (2008)\n\nA fictional look back at the interviews British journalist David Frost did with disgraced former President Richard Nixon after Watergate. Frost’s final session with Nixon is a masterclass in interviewing.\n\n22. Kill the Messenger (2014)\n\nBased on a true story, this is the film about the late San Jose Mercury-News reporter Gary Webb and his series about CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking. Often overlooked when talking about great films about journalism.\n\n21. Zodiac (2007)\n\nNo one knows the case of San Francisco’s Zodiac serial killer better than Robert Graysmith, a former cartoonist and true crime author who spent 13 years and wrote two books (and saw his marriage end in divorce) over the case. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith in this David Fincher thriller.\n\n20. Under Fire (1983)\n\nSet during the last days of the Nicaraguan Revolution in the late 1970s, this film is based on the murder of ABC reporter Bill Stewart and his translator in 1979. Its all-star cast features great performances from Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman.\n\n19. Salvador (1986)\n\nThere was a time when actors James Woods and Jim Belushi and director Oliver Stone were all really good. They all came together for this better-than-you-think film, which focuses on a hard-drinking and drug-using photojournalist played by Woods, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.\n\n18. His Girl Friday (1940)\n\nI briefly considered putting “The Philadelphia Story” in this slot, but went with this screwball comedy starring Cary Grant (as a newspaper editor) and Rosalind Russell (as his ace reporter) because it’s more about “journalism” and it’s just, well, better.\n\n17. Live from Baghdad (2002)\n\nThis made-for-TV HBO movie shows the pivotal moment in CNN history when the network was in Iraq for the start of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. It showed the power of a 24-hour news network. Actor Michael Keaton (who, by the way, is in three of the movies on this list) is superb as CNN producer Robert Wiener.\n\n16. State of Play (2009)\n\nRussell Crowe plays a journalist who looks into the suspicious death of a congressman’s lover. The cast is ridiculous: Crowe, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, Robin Wright and Jeff Daniels.\n\n15. Reds (1981)\n\nOne of the best movies of the 1980s is about John Reed and his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution, which resulted in his book “Ten Days That Shook the World.” Warren Beatty directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in this movie that also featured Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n14. The Post (2017)\n\nI still think most of this movie about the Pentagon Papers is only slightly better than average, but if you don’t get goosebumps when the presses start rolling and if you don’t tear up when the Supreme Court decision is announced, well, you might want to see if you have a pulse\n\n13. The Year of Living Dangerously (1982)\n\nThis really is a love story, but it’s set during the overthrow of Indonesian President Sukarno in the 1960s and features Mel Gibson as an Australian journalist. He falls in love with Sigourney Weaver’s character. The real star of the movie is Linda Hunt, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress while playing a man.\n\n12. Good Night and Good Luck (2005)\n\nThis George Clooney movie about how Edward R. Murrow brought down Sen. Joe McCarthy resonates today as journalists take on politicians who are bullies and liars, and who push agendas that separate the country.\n\n11. The Insider (1999)\n\nA fictionalized account of a “60 Minutes” report about tobacco-industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. The all-star cast includes Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt and Al Pacino as award-winning journalist Lowell Bergman.\n\n10. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nIn terms of filmmaking, this is the best movie on this list and one of the greatest movies ever made. The story, believed to be based on the life of media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, would have been higher in our rankings if there had been just a little more actual journalism.\n\n9. Killing Fields (1984)\n\nThe fall of Cambodia is the backdrop in a movie that can be hard to watch even once. But the true story of New York Times’ Sydney Schanberg and his friendship with Cambodian colleague Dith Pran is a movie that should be seen — at least once.\n\n8. The China Syndrome (1979)\n\nHow creepy is this: This movie about a nuclear power plant disaster referenced a leak that could impact a chunk of America the size of Pennsylvania. Twelve days after its release, there was a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in central Pennsylvania. Everyone in this cast — Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilfred Brimley and, especially, Jack Lemmon — is phenomenal.\n\n7. The Paper (1994)\n\nThe most underrated film on this list. When it came out, many journalists scoffed at this movie because of the stereotypes. Then you realize clichés become clichés because they are true. This used to be a guilty pleasure movie for journalists. Now, it’s a cult favorite among anyone who has ever worked at a newspaper.\n\n6. Shattered Glass (2003)\n\nThis movie should be talked about more. Hayden Christensen and Peter Sarsgaard are perfect in this nearly flawless film about how The New Republic’s Stephen Glass built a reputation as one of journalism’s hot-shot young writers by making up most of what he wrote.\n\n5. Absence of Malice (1981)\n\nThe most journalistic movie title ever. It’s the legal definition for a defense against a libel lawsuit. Paul Newman is on top of his game, Wilford Brimley takes over one of the climactic scenes, Sally Field is perfect as the eager young reporter and Melinda Dillon is heartbreaking in a scene when she picks up newspapers off the lawns in her neighborhood to keep readers from finding a story that she had an abortion.\n\n4. Network (1976)\n\nThis bitterly funny movie about TV news is more than 40 years old, yet has a message that is as powerful now as ever. Seriously, Howard Beale’s legendary “I’m as mad as hell” speech would fit in perfectly on today’s TV, where anger and polarization trump journalism and reporting.\n\n3. Spotlight (2015)\n\nThe true story of The Boston Globe’s investigation into sexual abuse in the Catholic church is this generation’s “All the President’s Men,” showing relentless and tedious shoe-leather reporting, while going up against a powerful organization. Like “All the President’s Men,” it’s an inspiration for young journalists.\n\n2. Broadcast News (1987)\n\nThis hilarious satire hits closer to real-life network TV than you might realize. Holly Hunter’s character, Jane, who is loosely based on former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky, is one of the richest characters ever written for the screen, while William Hurt (the dumb but pretty anchor) and Albert Brooks (the smart but awkward reporter) are brilliant.\n\n1. All the President’s Men (1976)\n\nLet’s not get cute or overthink this. This is the best movie about journalism ever made, and it’s not even close. The nail-biting (even though you already know the ending) gold standard is the reason many journalists reading this went into the business.\n\nAs a bonus, here are our 10 favorite fictional journalists, our 10 favorite funny journalists and our 10 favorite fictional news organizations.\n\nOur 10 favorite fictional journalists\n\nJane Craig (Broadcast News)\n\nHenry Hackett (The Paper)\n\nSteve Everett (True Crime)\n\nCamille Preaker (Sharp Objects)\n\nClark Kent (Superman)\n\nMiranda Priestly (The Devil Wears Prada)\n\nLou Grant (Lou Grant)\n\nWill McAvoy (Newsroom)\n\nBrenda Starr (Brenda Star, Reporter)\n\nStephen Colbert (The Colbert Report)\n\nOur 10 favorite funny journalists\n\nLes Nessman (WKRP in Cincinnati)\n\nRon Burgundy (Anchorman)\n\nSlap Maxwell (Slap Maxwell)\n\nIrwin Fletcher (Fletch)\n\nCarl Kolchak (Kolchak: The Night Stalker)\n\nTed Baxter (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)\n\nMurphy Brown (Murphy Brown)\n\nOscar Madison (The Odd Couple)\n\nHildy Johnson (His Girl Friday)\n\nMichael McDougal (The Paper)\n\nOur 10 favorite fictional news organizations\n\nThe Daily Planet (Superman)\n\nUnion Broadcasting System (Network)\n\nNew York Sun (The Paper)\n\nKVWN-Ch. 4-San Diego (Anchorman)\n\nWJM-Minneapolis (Mary Tyler Moore Show)\n\nDaily Bugle (Spiderman)\n\nThe Lone Gunman (X-Files)\n\nLos Angeles Tribune (Lou Grant)\n\nAtlantic Cable News (Newsroom)\n\nNew York Star (Sex and the City)\n\nWhat do you think of our list? Do you agree, disagree or think we left a deserving film out? Let us hear from you at news@poynter.org or on Twitter @poynter.\n\nCorrection: Maureen Stapleton starred in “Reds,” not Jean Stapleton. We’d like to say we at least kept it all in the family but the two are not related.\n\nThis column was originally published April 12, 2019."
