        "text": "media release\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nTIFF announces 2024 Wavelengths and Classics programmes\n\nWavelengths welcomes critically acclaimed auteurs, major artists, and exciting new talent, with films by Wang Bing, Miguel Gomes, Roberto Minervini, Nicolás Pereda, Jessica Sarah Rinland, Wael Shawky, Tiffany Sia, Malena Szlam, Daphne Xu, and more\n\nTIFF Classics presents recent 4K restorations of films by Lino Brocka, Atom Egoyan, Raj Kapoor, Srinivas Krishna, Sohrab Shahid Saless, and Frederick Wiseman\n\nToronto — TIFF is delighted to announce the 2024 selection for the Wavelengths programme, and the TIFF Classics programme, presented by MUBI, and supported by Ontario Creates and the Canada Council for the Arts. The 49th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival, presented by Rogers, will take place September 5–15, 2024.\n\nWAVELENGTHS\n\nHighlighting visionary work from the worlds of international cinema and contemporary art, the Wavelengths programme includes a dynamic selection of 11 features, 3 shorts programmes, and a special in-cinema looped presentation. Intergenerational and regionally diverse, with emerging talents screening alongside legendary peers, the films in this year’s selection range from a two-minute animation to a gripping 14-hour documentary, offering a mix of dazzling formal work, subversive narratives, and boldly political perspectives.\n\nThe 2024 Wavelengths programme is curated by Senior Curator Andréa Picard and Associate Curator Jesse Cumming, with contributions by Giovanna Fulvi, Nataleah Hunter-Young, and June Kim.\n\nWatch this video of Wavelengths Lead Programmer Andréa Picard to learn more:\n\nFeature film highlights include a number by esteemed Wavelengths alumni, among them the North American Premieres of Grand Tour by Miguel Gomes, The Damned by Roberto Minervini, and Pepe by Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias.\n\nJessica Sarah Rinland also returns to the programme with Collective Monologue, alongside the North American Premiere of the queer, controversial Viêt and Nam, by first-time Wavelengths filmmaker Trương Minh Quý. The 14-hour, compulsively watchable exergue - on documenta 14 from Greek filmmaker Dimitris Athiridi will be presented over three screenings.\n\nShort film highlights include the World Premieres of Archipelago of Earthen Bones — To Bunya by Malena Szlam, and A Black Screen Too by Sobey Prize–nominated Rhayne Vermette, as well as the North American Premiere of Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s The Diary of a Sky. A pairing of work by legendary filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and John Smith includes the former’s final film Scénarios, completed just before Godard’s death, and the World Premiere of Smith’s wry, moving Being John Smith.\n\nPresented as a rare and unmissable special presentation, the programme is rounded out by celebrated Egyptian artist Wael Shawky’s Drama 1882. A mesmerizing highlight of this year’s Venice Biennale, the film (re)stages an anti-colonial uprising as a libretto across eight chapters and 45 hypnotic minutes. Drama 1882 will be presented looped in-cinema on Saturday, September 7, and admission will be free.\n\nCLASSICS\n\nTIFF Classics reunites audiences with iconic films from visionary filmmakers such as Srinivas Krishna, Raj Kapoor, and Atom Egoyan. Two newly restored international discoveries include Shahid Sohrab Saless’ Time of Maturity, and Lino Brocka’s Bona. In celebration of the centenary of auteur Raj Kapoor, known as The Greatest Showman of Indian Cinema, TIFF Classics presents the World Premiere 4K restoration of one of his most acclaimed films, Awāra, which he directs and stars in. Continuing TIFF’s year-long spotlight on Toronto New Wave filmmakers, Classics is screening the 4K restoration of Atom Egoyan’s The Sweet Hereafter; and Srinivas Krishna’s Masala, a restoration that was made possible through Canadian Cinema – Reignited, a Telefilm Canada initiative, in partnership with TIFF. Lastly, Classics is honoured to present the World Premiere of the new 4K restoration of legendary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman’s documentary Essene.\n\nThe 2024 Classics programme is programmed by Robyn Citizen, TIFF’s Director of Programming, and Andréa Picard.\n\nWavelengths Features 2024 (in alphabetical order)\n\nCollective Monologue [Monólogo colectivo] Jessica Sarah Rinland | Argentina/United Kingdom\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nexergue - on documenta 14 Dimitris Athiridis | Greece\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nGrand Tour Miguel Gomes | Portugal/Italy/France/Germany/Japan/China\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nLázaro at Night [Lázaro de noche] Nicolás Pereda | Canada/Mexico\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nPepe Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias | Dominican Republic/Germany/France/Namibia\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nPerfumed with Mint [Moattar binanaa] Muhammed Hamdy | Egypt/France/Tunisia/Qatar\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nThe Ballad of Suzanne Césaire Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich | USA\n\nCanadian Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nThe Damned Roberto Minervini | Italy/USA/Belgium North American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nViêt and Nam Trương Minh Quý | Philippines/Singapore/France/Netherlands/Italy/Germany/Vietnam\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nYouth (Hard Times) [Qing Chun (Ku)] Wang Bing | France/Luxembourg/Netherlands\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nLuminaries\n\nYouth (Homecoming) [Qing Chun (Gui)] Wang Bing | France/Luxembourg/Netherlands\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nLuminaries\n\nWavelengths Special Presentation 2024:\n\nDrama 1882 Wael Shawky | Egypt\n\nFestival Premiere\n\nWavelengths Shorts 2024:\n\nWAVELENGTHS 1: EYE & EAR CONTROL\n\nRevolving Rounds Johann Lurf, Christina Jauernik | Austria\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nThe Diary of a Sky Lawrence Abu Hamdan | Lebanon\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nOctober Noon [Octubre al mediodía] Francisco Rodríguez Teare | Chile/France\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nA Black Screen Too Rhayne Vermette | Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nArchipelago of Earthen Bones — To Bunya Malena Szlam | Canada/Australia/Chile\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nWAVELENGTHS 2: RIDE THE WAVE\n\nSomeplace in Your Mouth Beatrice Gibson, Nick Gordon | Italy\n\nInternational Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nNotes of a Crocodile Daphne Xu | Cambodia/China/Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nAdrift Potentials [Potenciais à deriva] Leonardo Pirondi | Brazil/USA\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nGo Between Chris Kennedy | Canada/Australia\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nThe Sojourn [暫棲] Tiffany Sia | USA\n\nCanadian Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nWAVELENGTHS 3: EXPOSÉ(S) - JEAN-LUC GODARD/JOHN SMITH\n\nScénarios Jean-Luc Godard | France/Japan\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nExposé du film annonce du film “Scénario” Jean-Luc Godard | France/Japan\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nBeing John Smith John Smith | United Kingdom\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nClassics Programme 2024 (in alphabetical order)\n\nAwāra Raj Kapoor | India\n\nBona Lino Brocka | Philippines\n\nEssene Frederick Wiseman | USA\n\nMasala Srinivas Krishna | Canada\n\nThe Sweet Hereafter Atom Egoyan | Canada\n\nTime of Maturity [Reifezeit] Sohrab Shahid Saless | Germany\n\nTomorrow’s final TIFF Takeover is the Short Cuts and Primetime programmes.
