It is in.\n\nAnd the very question now\n\nis precisely what we've got\n\nin the bank.\n\nThis will cost us everything\n\nwe think we have.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd Birmingham is an incident,\n\nyou know, which may become a\n\nshrine.\n\nWhat is really crucial is\n\nwhether or not the country,\n\nthe people in the country, the\n\ncitizenry, are able to recognize\n\nthat there is no moral distance,\n\nno moral distance,\n\nwhich is to say no distance\n\nbetween the facts of life\n\nin San Francisco and the facts\n\nof life in Birmingham.\n\nWe've got to call, you know,\n\nwe've got to tell it like it is.\n\nAnd that's where it's at.\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I said I wasn't gonna\n\ntell nobody ♪\n\n♪ But I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Said I wasn't gonna tell\n\nnobody ♪\n\n♪ But I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I ♪\n\n>> ♪ What the lord has done for\n\nme ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I said I wasn't gonna\n\ntell nobody ♪\n\n♪ But I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh, I ♪\n\n>> ♪ Couldn't keep it to\n\nmyself ♪\n\n>> ♪ I said I wasn't gonna tell\n\nnobody ♪\n\n♪ But I ♪\n\n>> I imagine it'd be easy for\n\nany white person walking through\n\nSan Francisco to imagine that\n\neverything was at peace because\n\nit certainly looks it that way,\n\nyou know, on the surface.\n\nSan Francisco's much prettier\n\nthan New York.\n\nAnd it's easier to hide in\n\nSan Francisco than it is in\n\nNew York because you've got the\n\nview, you've got the hills.\n\nYou've got the San Francisco\n\nlegend, too, which is that\n\nit's cosmopolitan and\n\nforward-looking.\n\nBut it's just another American\n\ncity.\n\nAnd if you're a black man, that\n\nmeans that's a very bitter thing\n\nto say.\n\nChildren are dying here as they\n\nare in New York for the very\n\nsame reason.\n\nBut, see, it's a somewhat better\n\nplace to lie about it.\n\nThat's really all it comes to.\n\nNobody wants to destroy the\n\nimage of San Francisco.\n\n>> Old city.\n\n>> Oh, yes. Yes.\n\n>> I'd like to acquaint you\n\nwith, uh, San Francisco\n\nas a whole, Mr. Baldwin.\n\nAnd I think, mostly, that what's\n\nbeing watched here today is\n\nsomethin' black, and the young\n\npeople go to school together,\n\nthey graduate off the same\n\nstage, and then when it comes to\n\njobs, the black face is not\n\nqualified, but they graduate.\n\nThen my daughter has to go clean\n\nup the same girl's house that\n\nshe graduates off the stage.\n\nAs I said, the most that's\n\nbeing watched is the black face.\n\n>> What we were talking about\n\nlast night, coming in from the\n\nairport, was the real situation\n\nof Negroes in this city...\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> ...as opposed to the image...\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> ...San Francisco would like\n\nto present.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Well, why don't you tell me\n\na little bit about it?\n\nI know a lot about New York,\n\nbut I'm a stranger here.\n\nLet's say I'm sure the --\n\nI'm sure the, um, principle\n\nholds, but I'm curious about the\n\ndetails.\n\n>> Well, one thing about it\n\nin this particular area,\n\nabout 80% of the people in this\n\narea are Negro.\n\nThis is a real large housing\n\nproject.\n\nThere's -- As far as delinquency\n\nis concerned, we rank about\n\nfourth.\n\nThe job situation is bad.\n\nThis is a real black belt\n\nof San Francisco.\n\nI think that, uh,\n\nthe lady over to your left,\n\nMrs. Nichols, is a good\n\nrepresentative of one of the\n\nindigenous leaders in this area.\n\n>> Tell me something.\n\nIt may sound like a stupid\n\nquestion, but it's a question I\n\nhave to ask myself all the time.\n\nWhat, precisely, do you say\n\nto a Negro kid, um...\n\nto, um...invest him with...\n\na morale which the country\n\nis determined he shan't have?\n\nOr to spell that out much more\n\nspecifically, when dealing with\n\na Negro kid and trying to insist\n\nthat he know that he can do\n\nanything he wants to do,\n\nhow do you make him believe it?\n\n>> That's a difficult question.\n\nI think that, uh,\n\nthat one of the main things\n\nthat we have to make and\n\nbelieve...\n\nYou know,\n\nthey say everybody can be the\n\nPresident of the United States.\n\n>> That's true.\n\n>> And then, uh...this boy,\n\nuh, grows up and he comes up.\n\nBut by the time he gets 14 or\n\n15 years old, he begins to find\n\nout that, uh, that, uh, this --\n\nthis is not true and to make\n\nhim, uh, face --\n\nbe able to face what's coming to\n\nhim in the future.\n\n>> ....be a Negro president\n\nin this country.\n\n>> There'll never be a Negro\n\npresident in this country?\n\nWhy do you say that?\n\n>> We can't get jobs.\n\nHow we gonna be a president?\n\n>> Exactly.\n\nBut I want you to think about\n\nthis.\n\nThere will be a Negro president\n\nof this country, but it will not\n\nbe the country that we are\n\nsitting in now.\n\nWhat if you say to yourself,\n\n\"There never will be a Negro\n\npresident of this country?\"\n\nAnd what you're doing\n\nis agreeing with white people\n\nwho say you are inferior.\n\nIt's not important, really, you\n\nknow, whether or not there's a\n\nNegro president, I mean, in that\n\nway.\n\nWhat's important is that you\n\nshould realize that you can\n\nbecome -- you can become the\n\nPresident.\n\nThere's nothing anybody --\n\nanybody can do that you can't\n\ndo.\n\n>> Well, the truth is if you get\n\nthem, if you get --\n\nI don't -- I don't think this is\n\nan exaggeration.\n\nI think the truth still is that\n\neven when you get to the most\n\nmeager opportunity, you've got\n\nto be at least five times as\n\ngood as anybody else around,\n\nfive times as good not only at\n\nthe job, but...\n\nThis is what is so dangerous,\n\nI think.\n\nYou have to have a certain...\n\nThe boys that I grew up with,\n\nI grew up in the streets\n\nin Harlem.\n\nAnd of the survivors,\n\nwhat marks all the survivors\n\nis a certain ruthlessness\n\nwhich was absolutely\n\nindispensable when -- when we're\n\ngoing to survive.\n\n>> I can do it.\n\nI can do it. I can do it.\n\nI don't have to work --\n\nI don't have to work for nobody\n\nand I can make it.\n\nI don't have to work --\n\n>> But how do you make it?\n\n>> What you mean, how I make it?\n\nThis is something -- I'm not\n\ngonna tell you how I make it.\n\nLookit, I'm indicting myself,\n\nbrother, talking to you.\n\nYou go back and tell the police\n\nwhat I did.\n\n[ Laughter ]\n\n>> I didn't say you were doin'\n\nnothin'.\n\n>> No, you're doing that for --\n\nWhat if I tell you that I robbed\n\na bank in Los Angeles?\n\nYou believe that?\n\n>> Well, no, if you --\n\nif you don't say you did.\n\n>> I ain't gonna say I did,\n\nneither.\n\n>> The things you'll be talking\n\nabout now, their real problem\n\nis that they cannot find,\n\nin the country, any -- any\n\nreason to accept anything the\n\ncountry says.\n\nAnd they're very young, so they\n\ncan't find anything else,\n\neither.\n\nAnd this is how they end up,\n\nfor example, on the needle.\n\nIt's a crime committed by\n\none section of the population,\n\nof the populace,\n\nagainst another section\n\nof the populace.\n\nAnd it's a crime which really\n\ncould destroy this country.\n\n>> What do you think about the\n\npolice?\n\n>> I think they have a purpose.\n\nBut, then again, the way some of\n\nthese people do you sometimes\n\nwhen they pick you up and stop\n\nyou...\n\nOr, like, a couple of times\n\nwe'd be downtown just walkin'\n\naround, they'd look at you.\n\nIf you look suspicious,\n\nthey would just stop you.\n\nLike, I was goin' to a show\n\none night, me and my wife.\n\nAnd we just happened to go\n\naround Market Street, and we\n\nseen this police car go by.\n\nAll right, we can turn the\n\ncorner then make the corner.\n\nThey meet us. And they stop us.\n\nOur show starts at 7:45.\n\nWe were out there till 9:00.\n\nBut then they didn't have no\n\nexcuse to stop us.\n\nBut they stopped us, searched\n\nthe car, call in, and this and\n\nthat.\n\nAnd what was the purpose of\n\nthat?\n\nWe weren't doing anything wrong.\n\nNobody was mad.\n\nLet me ask you one thing.\n\nWhat do police do when they get\n\nmad?\n\n>> What do the police do when\n\nthey get mad?\n\n>> I mean, we ordinary citizens.\n\nWhen we get mad, we can do\n\nthings to hurt people and rob\n\nand steal.\n\nWhat -- what do they do when\n\nthey get mad?\n\nWho do they take their steam off\n\non?\n\n>> I think you know the answer\n\nto that question.\n\n>> Well, I couldn't answer that\n\nbecause the police has never\n\nbothered me in that way.\n\nBut I read newspapers, and I've\n\nbeen livin' around here all my\n\nlife and I see things goin' on.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\nWell, when a policeman gets mad,\n\nhe's got a gun.\n\nAnd he's got a club.\n\nYeah.\n\n>> It's one thing\n\nthat's different in, uh,\n\nSan Francisco and Birmingham,\n\nit is that San Francisco is\n\nwhitewash.\n\n>> Yeah. Precisely.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> In San Francisco, it's under\n\nthe rug.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> You know, it hasn't hit the\n\nheadlines yet, and everyone --\n\neveryone in San Francisco,\n\nevery white person in\n\nSan Francisco pretend they\n\nhaven't got a Negro problem.\n\nEverywhere I have been in this\n\ncountry, if you talk to a white\n\nperson, he says race relations\n\nare excellent, and I've yet to\n\nfind a single Negro in this\n\ncountry who agrees with that.\n\n>> And then if you ask that the\n\nNegro have a better opportunity,\n\nask that Negro be hired in a\n\nlarge firm, they only reach out\n\nand hire one just to shut your\n\nmouth.\n\n>> And put him in the window.\n\n>> Well, Mr. Baldwin, I'd like\n\nto also say that Hunters Point\n\nseems to me, in my opinion,\n\nthe way you're lookin' at it,\n\nHunters Point is just like\n\nbeing in Alabama right now.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> And I feel that we don't --\n\nsome of the ones that can't go\n\ndown, we can -- we can march on\n\nSan Francisco for the black man,\n\nto help the black woman.\n\nWe can do that here because it\n\nhas been stated that until we\n\nwork on this, San Francisco\n\nand other areas --New York and\n\nall Chicago and all around --\n\nthat we can get something done.\n\nWe can help our brothers\n\nin the South.\n\n>> In the South, yes.\n\n>> Those -- The black people\n\nin Alabama are my people.\n\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n>> Primarily, I'm from Texas.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> But anywhere in the South,\n\nanywhere a Negro is -- a black\n\nman is involved, I'm there.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> I'm the mother of five kids,\n\nthe mother of a 9-week-old baby.\n\nBut if the time comes where\n\nI can't march here in\n\nSan Francisco, I certainly will\n\nbeg, borrow a ticket to go to\n\nAlabama.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> And I am ready.\n\n>> ♪ You are the reason ♪\n\n>> ♪ You're the reason ♪\n\n>> ♪ That saved my soul ♪\n\n>> ♪ Saved my soul ♪\n\n>> ♪ That Sunday morning ♪\n\n>> ♪ Sunday morning ♪\n\n>> ♪ I put my ♪\n\n>> ♪ Knees on the ground ♪\n\n>> ♪ Oh ♪\n\n>> I suppose that no one in\n\nSan Francisco has any sense of\n\nwhat a dangerous area this is.\n\nAnd I think this is one of the\n\nreal troubles that the Negro has\n\nin San Francisco --\n\nHe doesn't really know his place\n\nbecause it hasn't been really\n\nspelled out.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And he's trying to find his\n\nplace, and it's so...\n\nThis is one of the problems,\n\nyou know what I mean?\n\nWhat place is there for me?\n\nYou know, he came out to escape.\n\nAnd then you keep trying...\n\n>> And this is another prison.\n\n>> That's right. You know?\n\nAnd you find yourself facin' the\n\nPacific Ocean, you know?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> There's no place else to go.\n\n>> Yes. Yeah.\n\n>> You know?\n\nNow, you can see this is...\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> More residences and even\n\napartments and so forth.\n\nComing down, we will soon be\n\nto Market Street.\n\n>> The great problem is how in\n\nthe world one is going to\n\ninvest these children with a new\n\nmorale, a sense of their own\n\nworth because the country isn't\n\ngonna do it.\n\nThe country won't do it.\n\nI suppose one can say as long as\n\nthe country can't do it, then\n\nhe'll be able to choose his own\n\nworth.\n\n>> We have no race here.\n\nWe have no race at all.\n\n>> We have no flags.\n\n>> No.\n\n>> No cut.\n\n>> Think they're better.\n\n>> No.\n\n>> The white man? Oh!\n\n>> Tell me what you mean.\n\n>> You know what I mean?\n\n>> Take what you want.\n\n>> Huh? Tell me what you mean.\n\n>> What I mean?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> I mean, I'm tryin'...\n\n>> No, we gonna tell it, man.\n\nWe gonna tell it.\n\n>> I don't have nothin' over\n\nhere.\n\n>> No, no.\n\n>> Nothing over here?\n\n>> Nothing.\n\nI don't have anything.\n\n>> Where the man at?\n\n>> How long you felt that way?\n\n>> How long I felt that way?\n\nSince 1956.\n\n>> Since 1956?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Why did you feel that way?\n\n>> Huh?\n\n>> Why did you feel that way?\n\n>> Because I realized what a dog\n\nthe white man was.\n\n>> How did you come to realize\n\nit?\n\n>> When he got to start jumpin'\n\non me and puttin' me in jail and\n\neverything, you know.\n\n>> Where did that happen?\n\n>> Where?\n\nRight here in San Francisco...\n\n>> Right here in San Francisco?\n\n>> California. Wasn't nothin'.\n\n>> Tell me how it started.\n\n>> How it started?\n\nWhat you mean, how it started?\n\n>> Tell me about the first time\n\nyou were arrested.\n\n>> First time I was arrested?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Well, that was...\n\n>> That was in 1948.\n\n>> That was in 1948?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> What for?\n\n>> Well, I don't know what they\n\ncall it, but I got caught in a\n\nbedroom with a little white\n\ngirl, said she was a juvenile.\n\n>> [ Laughs ] Where was that?\n\n>> Right here in San Francisco.\n\n>> In San Francisco?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> How old were you in 1948?\n\n>> 8.\n\n>> What?\n\n>> 8.\n\n>> Never let the white man catch\n\nyou on your knees, brother.\n\n>> You were 8 years old in 19...\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> You were 8 years old in 1948?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And you were caught in bed\n\nwith a little white girl?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And you went to jail?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> When you were 8?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> In San Francisco?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And, lookit, you learn from\n\nthe world you live in, brother.\n\nThis white man ain't teach you\n\nnothin' in his book but what you\n\nought to know, and you ain't\n\ngonna know nothin' about it...\n\n>> He's not even teachin' me\n\nabout the future of my people.\n\n>> What you goin' to school\n\nfor then, dummy?\n\n>> We don't even have a country.\n\n>> I know that.\n\n>> Do we have a country?\n\n>> He's sayin' you ought to\n\nthink this is your country,\n\nwhich is not your country.\n\nWhat flag is a black man's flag?\n\nWe have no flag, brother.\n\nNo flag at all.\n\n>> People, people,\n\nwe not gonna get nothin',\n\nnot by sittin' around here\n\ndoin' this sit-in demonstrations\n\nor nothin'.\n\nPeople not gonna do anything for\n\nus.\n\n>> Well, how are we gonna do it?\n\n>> Huh? By violence. Violence.\n\n>> And when you say...\n\n>> By uprisin', having a\n\nrevolution.\n\n>> But there are 20 million of\n\nus.\n\n>> 20 million? That's enough.\n\n>> Not these days and not in\n\nthose terms.\n\n>> Oh, it's enough.\n\n>> They're scattered. 48 states.\n\n>> 48 states? Get 'em together.\n\n>> How?\n\n>> How? Through Islam.\n\n>> What?\n\n>> The true religion, you know.\n\nGet all the people together, get\n\n'em all believin' one thing, and\n\nthen they can't help but stick\n\ntogether.\n\nI mean, we can't stick together\n\nnow, half of us Christians,\n\nthe other half Baptists, you\n\nknow, some Jews and all that.\n\nAnd what good is that gonna do\n\nus?\n\n>> Catholics. Mm-hmm.\n\n>> So you think the only thing\n\nwe can do...\n\n>> Is get together.\n\n>> ...is have an armed uprising?\n\n>> Really.\n\nJust with blood, you know?\n\nLet everybody bleed a little\n\nbit.\n\nThat's the only way we're gonna\n\nget anything.\n\nWhat happened to the people in\n\nBirmingham?\n\n>> Well, Birmingham isn't over\n\nyet.\n\n>> Oh, it's over.\n\nOh, yeah. It's over.\n\n>> It's over.\n\n>> It's over.\n\n>> They done sent in the state\n\ntroopers, the federal.\n\nIt's all over now.\n\nPeople, they had a little old,\n\nyou know, little old show\n\nSunday night and all.\n\nThat was the only thing they\n\ndid.\n\nWhen they was marchin' around\n\nin them thousands and thousands,\n\nwasn't nothin' happenin'.\n\nThey got mad Sunday.\n\nJumped on a few of 'em, sent a\n\nfew of 'em to the hospital.\n\nAnd then what happens?\n\nThey say, \"We gonna give you\n\nwhat you want,\" huh?\n\nYeah. That ain't nothin'.\n\nAin't gonna get nothin'.\n\n>> Now, the Negro teenager...\n\nHe doesn't have any possibility\n\nas we sit here now -- I mean, as\n\nof this moment, this is not\n\nhistorical -- does not have any\n\npossibility of accepting\n\nAmerican history, which is to\n\nsay, he has no way of learning\n\nit because it has not been\n\nand it is not being taught.\n\nYet, there is no possibility\n\nfor him to begin to act on what\n\nwe always like to think of as\n\nthe American assumptions, you\n\nknow, a man's a man for all that\n\nand all that jazz.\n\nIt isn't that he wouldn't.\n\nIt's because there's no\n\npossibility of his doing so\n\nbecause the country intends to\n\nkeep him in his place and still\n\ndoes because the only way a\n\nNegro teenager can make it is to\n\nstep outside that system, you\n\nknow, to become an effective\n\ncriminal on whatever level, you\n\nknow, to become an operator, you\n\nknow, like they need to make it,\n\nor to turn to Malcolm X.\n\n>> They tryin' to tear down our\n\nhomes, brother, and when the\n\nwhite man try to tear down your\n\nhome, then it's time for you to\n\ndo somethin'.\n\nBut what can we do?\n\nWe don't know anything about\n\nwhat's goin' on.\n\nI mean, we try to go to the\n\nmeeting and things like that.\n\nWe watch the television.\n\nWe watch all this\n\nabout Birmingham down there.\n\nJust like Malcolm X said\n\nyesterday on television,\n\nhe said, \"The white man, he talk\n\nabout truth.\"\n\nAnd, uh, this man, Mr. King,\n\nhe down there talkin' about,\n\n\"Yeah, can we get some kinda --\n\nCan we get some kinda\n\ncooperation?\n\nCan we get some kinda truth\n\ndown there?\"\n\nOh, what are they doin'\n\ndown there?\n\nThey not doin' anything.\n\nSee, I'm callin' him a chump,\n\njust like Malcolm X call it.\n\nHe's a chump, and I think a\n\nblack Muslim is right in some of\n\nhis doings.\n\nAnd I think that a truce down\n\nthere is impossible.\n\nIt's utterly impossible.\n\nIt's fantastic and it's\n\nunbelievable.\n\n[ Applause ]\n\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\nWait, wait, let me tell you.\n\nNow, they talkin' about better\n\njobs -- jobs right here.\n\nYou want me to tell you what\n\nkind of job they gonna give us?\n\nThey gonna let us tear down our\n\nown homes out here on\n\nHunters Point.\n\nThat's the job we gettin'.\n\nAnd you know what they gonna pay\n\nus?\n\nLet me tell you what they gonna\n\npay us.\n\nThey gonna pay you $2 an hour.\n\nThey gonna holler some kind of\n\napprenticeship deal or somethin'\n\nlike that.\n\nNow, I mean, what else is that\n\ngainin' you?\n\nIt's not gainin' you a thing.\n\nYou won't get anything.\n\nThey'll help you take...\n\nYou'll tear down your own homes.\n\nIt's a job, temporarily.\n\nAnd then what you gonna do?\n\nWhere you gonna live?\n\nYou're not gonna live anywhere.\n\nThey not even in the process\n\nof tryin' to tell you where you\n\ngonna live.\n\nAll they talkin' about is\n\ntearin' down Hunters Point.\n\n>> How long you been in\n\nSan Francisco?\n\n>> Oh, I've been in\n\nSan Francisco about 18 years,\n\never since I was about\n\na year or 2 old.\n\n>> And you live around here,\n\ntoo.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> In temporary housing or...\n\n>> No, I stay in the projects.\n\nIt ain't no temporary housin' no\n\nmore -- they tearin' them down.\n\n>> There used to be temporary\n\nhousing.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> Now it's permanent housing.\n\n>> Ain't no more.\n\nThere ain't gonna be no place\n\nwhen they get through.\n\n>> Ain't that right?\n\n>> We gonna be livin' out on the\n\nstreets.\n\n>> Does it make you feel bad\n\nbecause you...\n\n>> Yeah, it make you feel bad.\n\nWon't be no place to go.\n\nWe'd be livin' out here on the\n\nstreets in tents.\n\n>> Where would you like to go,\n\nif you could go?\n\nWhat part of San Francisco\n\nwould you like to go?\n\n>> I'd stay up here on top of\n\nthe hill.\n\n>> You would?\n\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n>> Now, how long you been\n\nlivin' on top of the hill?\n\n>> Ever since I been born.\n\n>> And then this is part of\n\na redevelopment, also.\n\n>> What do you mean, re...\n\nYou say \"redevelopment,\"\n\nmeaning...\n\n>> Removal of Negroes.\n\n>> Uh-huh. Yes. That's --\n\nThat's what I thought you meant.\n\n>> In other words, a lot of the\n\nNegroes who came because the\n\nJapanese were pushed out now are\n\nbeing pushed out, so...\n\n>> Now being pushed out\n\nthemselves.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> And they think San Francisco\n\nis reclaiming this...\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> ...this property...\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> ...to build it up,\n\nwhich means Negroes have to go.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> And in the...\n\n>> Where are they going to go?\n\n>> Well, they're going out\n\nto Hunters Point and to the\n\nHaight-Ashbury area and also\n\ninto Ocean View -- wherever they\n\ncan find the reasonable rents.\n\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n\n>> South of Market\n\nand all these other places,\n\nwherever they can find cheap\n\nrent, in other words...\n\n>> Oh.\n\n>> Going from one ghetto\n\nto the other.\n\n>> Yes. Yes.\n\nThis the Negro housing project,\n\nin effect?\n\n>> Yeah, as well as a few\n\nCaucasians staying here,\n\nyou know.\n\n>> Uh-huh.\n\nUm, I know a lot about housing\n\nprojects in New York, but I'm\n\nsure this doesn't differ at all.\n\n>> No, houses there,\n\nsome of the same problems,\n\nalthough, the building, the\n\nexterior looks...\n\n>> Well, the exterior looks\n\nmarvelous -- that's the whole\n\npoint, you know.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> But I know what goes on\n\ninside.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\nI'm sure that in the housing\n\nprojects...\n\nI know the housing projects in\n\nNew York.\n\nThe kids despise 'em, you know.\n\nBetter housing in the ghetto\n\nis simply not possible.\n\nYou can create, you can build a\n\nfew better plans, but you cannot\n\ndo anything about the moral and\n\npsychological effects of being\n\nin a ghetto.\n\n>> This is it.\n\n>> This -- this is the point.\n\nEverybody living in those\n\nhousing projects is just as in\n\ndanger as ever before by all the\n\nthings a ghetto means.\n\nBy raising the kids in one of\n\nthose housing projects, I would\n\nstill have, at the front door,\n\nor probably right next door,\n\nin the housing projects, all the\n\nthings I was trying to escape.\n\nThat means such things as...\n\nI mean, even from such things\n\nas -- as dealing with insurance\n\ncompanies if I want fire\n\ninsurance, you know, to the fact\n\nthat, um, in the playground,\n\nmy boy and my girl will be\n\nexposed to the man who sells\n\nnarcotics, for example,\n\nto a million forces where\n\nare inevitably set in motion\n\nwhen a people are despised.\n\nAnd you can't pretend that\n\nyou're not despised if you are.\n\nYou were saying yesterday that\n\nchildren can't be fooled.\n\nI can be fooled, you know, and\n\nbe glad about, you know, having\n\na three-room, whatever it is,\n\nsome mashed potatoes, a terrace\n\noverlooking a garage.\n\nBut my kid won't be because\n\nmy kids are being destroyed\n\nby these fantastic apartments.\n\n>> Now, this is the ILW housing\n\nproject, which will be\n\ninterracial.\n\nThe people who are renting it\n\nnow, 70 percent are Caucasian,\n\n30 percent are Negro.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> Then above that would be\n\nthe Eichler homes and so forth.\n\nEichlers always let Negros buy,\n\nif they had the money.\n\nAlthough, their apartments,\n\nI mean, their houses cost,\n\nsay, from $22,000 up to $32,000.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> So, naturally, this\n\nautomatically...\n\n>> Eliminates, yeah, Negroes.\n\n>> ...eliminates a lot of\n\npeople.\n\n>> I conclude that all this\n\nhas something to do with money.\n\nThe land has been reclaimed for\n\nmoney, and that the people who\n\nare putting up their houses\n\nexpect to make a profit, but it\n\nseems to me that I'm attacking\n\nwhat's called a profit motive.\n\nThere are some things more\n\nimportant than profits.\n\nI live in New York City, and\n\nit's been turned into a desert,\n\nreally, for the same reason.\n\nWhat is happening in\n\nSan Francisco now is that the\n\nsociety made the assumption and\n\ncertainly acts on the assumption\n\nthat to make money is more\n\nimportant than to have citizens.\n\nYou're paying too high a price\n\nfor this.\n\nAnd it isn't only what it's\n\ndoing to Negro children,\n\nwhich is, God knows, bad enough.\n\nIt's what it does to white\n\nchildren, who grow up believing\n\nthat it is more important to\n\nmake a profit than it is to be a\n\nman.\n\nAnd that's the way the society\n\nreally operates.\n\nI don't care what society says.\n\nThis is the way it operates.\n\nAnd these are the goals it sets.\n\nAnd these goals aren't worthy of\n\na man.\n\nAnd adolescents know it.\n\n>> Oh, you workin' out here?\n\n>> No. I'm not.\n\n>> Well, what has been some of\n\nthe -- what has been some of\n\nyour problems that you face\n\nas a Negro in San Francisco?\n\n>> Well, my main problem is, uh,\n\nfindin' a job.\n\nYesterday I talked to a guy\n\nmy wife knows that worked at a\n\nfill-up station.\n\nHe been out of service 2 months\n\nand he got two jobs.\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> I been here 8 years, and I\n\nworked about three steady jobs.\n\n>> You ain't got no job now.\n\n>> And, uh, I look every day,\n\njust like he say he started out.\n\nHe looked maybe once or twice a\n\nday, and he work at the fill-up\n\nstation and work longshoreman\n\nwork.\n\nAnd he told me, from his own\n\nmouth, who was on top.\n\nHe didn't come out and say\n\nit just like I'm gonna say it.\n\nBut he come out and told me\n\nthat, uh, you got to know\n\nsomebody in San Francisco to get\n\nsomewhere.\n\nAnd by knowin' somebody,\n\nit's got to be somebody\n\nwith authority.\n\nAnd nobody in San Francisco,\n\nno colored man got no authority.\n\n>> And I mean, no --\n\nThere are no Negro leaders in\n\nSan Francisco that you feel...\n\n>> Well, there are a few.\n\nThere are a few.\n\n>> Do you know any?\n\n>> No, I don't know any, but the\n\nones that get up there...\n\nThe ones that get up there,\n\nthey don't want to help nobody.\n\n>> No one has --\n\nNo one has ever helped you?\n\n>> No, nobody with authority,\n\nexcept my parole officer.\n\n>> Well, even the least damaged\n\nof those kids would have to...\n\n...to put as mildly as can be\n\nput at the moment, would have to\n\nbe a little sardonic about the\n\nthings he sees in television,\n\nwhat the President says and, um,\n\nall those movies about bein' a\n\ngood American and all that jazz.\n\nAnd you look at this,\n\nlook over there, look up here.\n\nAnd he would despise the people,\n\nyou know, who are able to have\n\nsuch a tremendous gap between\n\ntheir performance and their\n\nprofession.\n\nBut the more-damaged kids would\n\nsimply feel like blowing it up.\n\nSimply feel like blowing it up.\n\nIn speaking only for myself,\n\nyou know, that I feel --\n\nI feel a little sardonic.\n\nI'm civilized, I think.\n\nBut there was a time in my life\n\nwhen I would have felt just like\n\nblowing it up.\n\nWhat's more crucial,\n\nwhat's more terrible is how\n\nsince one's mainly left alone\n\nin terms of any help you can get\n\nfrom the country, in this\n\neffort, how do you get through\n\nto these damaged kids?\n\nAnd I don't know what I could\n\nsay which would make any sense\n\nto them because, in fact,\n\nthis does not make any sense.\n\nNow, with all of these beautiful\n\nbuildings, now, they're going to\n\nbe ringed in by hostile people.\n\n>> That's right.\n\n>> Just like they have in\n\nNew York.\n\n>> Hostile and frightened\n\npeople, because they don't...\n\nThey walk down the street and\n\nwonder why the first Negro boy\n\nthey see looks as them as though\n\nhe wants to kill them and,\n\nif he gets the chance, tries.\n\nAnd it's because he can't go to\n\nAsia, you know, he can't...\n\nIt's because he can't --\n\nHe hasn't -- He has no --\n\nHe has no ground to stand here.\n\nThe cat said yesterday,\n\n\"I got no country.\n\nI got no flag.\"\n\nAnd it isn't because he's a born\n\nparanoiac that he said that.\n\nIt's because of the performance\n\nof the country for his 18 years\n\non Earth has proven that to him.\n\nNow, how one manages to make\n\nthese people, these blind\n\npeople, begin to see...\n\nBasically, that building...\n\nIt has absolutely no foundation.\n\nAnd it really does not have\n\nany foundation.\n\nIt's going to come down,\n\none way or another.\n\nEither we will correct what's\n\nwrong.\n\nOr it'll be corrected for us.\n\n>> And this is the...\n\n>> What was that?\n\n>> The Saint Mary's Cathedral.\n\nThis bombed building here?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> I mean, not bombed, but, I\n\nmean...fired.\n\n>> Well, it looks bombed.\n\n>> There was a fire.\n\nBut this is gonna be torn down.\n\nBut this will not be\n\nthe site of the cathedral.\n\nThey're going to change it.\n\n>> Really is horrible to look\n\nat.\n\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\nThis was started one night.\n\nThey had --\n\nSome of the kids were having a\n\ndance in the downstairs.\n\nDidn't take it very long.\n\nIt just gutted the whole thing.\n\nBut as a result, the\n\nCatholic Church was able to\n\nraise $15 million to build\n\nanother cathedral.\n\n>> Some people know how to make\n\nit.\n\nI was raised a Christian,\n\nyou know.\n\nMy daddy and my mama were very\n\nreligious.\n\nThey knew that white Christians\n\nwere not Christians because of\n\nthe way they treated black\n\npeople.\n\nAnd the Christian Church in this\n\ncountry has never, in my\n\nexperience, never, as far as I\n\nknow, been Christian.\n\nThe record is much more than --\n\nis much more than shameful.\n\nThe record in -- The record\n\nproves that as we stand here\n\nas of this moment, the\n\nChristian Church is bankrupt.\n\nThere's not a single person I\n\ncould turn to, if I were tryin'\n\nto deal with one of those boys\n\nwe were talkin' to yesterday.\n\nIf I tried to tell them to go to\n\nchurch or even suggested the\n\nname of Jesus Christ, he'd spit\n\nin my face.\n\nAnd it's not because he doesn't\n\nlike my face.\n\nIt's because of what white\n\nChristians have done and do and\n\nnow deny.\n\nAll these churches are\n\nabsolutely meaningless.\n\nThey're almost blasphemous.\n\nIf they don't mean it, they\n\nshould -- you know, they should,\n\num, say so.\n\nChristianity has become a kind\n\nof social club.\n\nYou have to have a membership\n\ncard to get in, and black people\n\ncan't have a membership card.\n\nActually, Christianity, at the\n\nmoment, looks rather like that\n\nchurch, that shell.\n\n>> It's a God shop.\n\nI mean, what...\n\n>> Oh, the God shops.\n\nI think the God shops --\n\nI know the God shops are there\n\nto console a whole lot of\n\ndesperate people, what we can\n\nhere call the failure of\n\nChristianity, really, you know.\n\nThe people in the God shops\n\ntoday, it gives them the only...\n\nIt's only one of the few places\n\nthey can go to find any way of\n\ngetting through their day, of\n\ndealing with the landlord and,\n\num, pawnbroker and the children\n\nand the whole powerful complex\n\nof forces which bear you down\n\nevery day, when you no longer\n\naccept this whole notion of\n\nheaven later, you know,\n\nconcentration camp here.\n\nNext to the Morning Star\n\nMissionary Baptist Church.\n\n>> Yes.\n\nThis is one of the real\n\nlittle God shops.\n\n>> Well, see, I've always\n\nthought that Negro church is\n\nsinging and dancing and praying.\n\nMaybe they were really quite\n\nsimple-minded and happier,\n\nyou know, than white people.\n\nWhat goes on in those God shops,\n\nyou know, is exactly the thing\n\nthat's going on down in the\n\nMuslim temples, but no one has\n\never made that connection.\n\n>> Off to our left here\n\nis one Negro hotel, that's all.\n\n>> The only Negro hotel here?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> It's called the\n\nBooker T. Washington?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> Naturally.\n\nThis is a street that all\n\nNegroes are born on, you know,\n\nthe street all Negroes have to\n\nsurvive --\n\nthe Booker T. Washington, the\n\nBaptist Church, and the mosque.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThere's really a great history,\n\nyou know, a great thing to be\n\nsummed up in that, if one could.\n\n>> Looking at this street now,\n\nthe Booker T. Washington Hotel,\n\nI mean, what comes to your mind\n\nabout, uh, some type of music\n\nor some passage from the bible\n\nthat describes this?\n\n>> Sing the Lord's song\n\nin a strange land?\n\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\nI'm sure those guys across\n\nthe street can dance like, you\n\nknow, their white counterparts\n\ncan, and the reason they can is\n\nbecause they, in a way, they\n\nmust.\n\nIt is...\n\nIt's got to come out somehow.\n\nIt's got to come out somehow,\n\nyou know.\n\nAnd if the pressure is great\n\nenough, it has to come out in a\n\ncertain kind of...\n\nNegroes have great style.\n\nI think this is true, even if it\n\nsounds chauvinistic, and white\n\npeople don't have much style.\n\nAnd one of the reasons\n\nthe Negroes have a certain style\n\nis because they are aware of the\n\nconditions of their lives.\n\nThey can't prove themselves\n\nwithout it, you know.\n\nAnd when a Negro laughs or tries\n\nto make love or...\n\n...or eats or dances,\n\nit's a kind of total action.\n\nI don't mean this the way white\n\nliberals are gonna think I mean\n\nit.\n\nI don't mean that they're more\n\nsensual, more primitive,\n\nmore spontaneous and all this\n\nethnic jazz.\n\nI mean that they live --\n\nthey live on another level of\n\nexperience which doesn't allow\n\nthem as much room -- as much\n\nroom for make-believe as white\n\npeople have.\n\nAny American black man knows\n\nthat there's something\n\nthat American white men...\n\nThey're in the grip of some\n\nextraordinary sexual paranoia.\n\nAnd they really are.\n\nWhat that comes from is probably\n\nhistoric from some other, you\n\nknow, some other time and place.\n\nIn any case, such a long and\n\nterrible story and so\n\ncomplicated that one couldn't\n\nbegin to discuss it except by\n\nexamining, if you like, you\n\nknow, such things.\n\nWhen we read \"Huckleberry Finn,\"\n\nwe read William Faulkner, the\n\nrange between black and white\n\nmen in this country has always\n\nbeen the most extraordinary.\n\nAnd once....\n\nThere's something real in it and\n\na terrifying invention in it,\n\nand it goes all the way back to\n\nthe first time any American\n\nstarted writing, and it has\n\nsomething to do with the\n\nIndians.\n\nIf one could crack that nut,\n\nreally, open that can of beans,\n\nif one could try to find out --\n\nand this is something white\n\npeople have to do, Negroes can't\n\ndo it -- exactly what a Negro\n\nmeans to a white man...\n\nI don't mean what he means\n\nin terms of signing petitions\n\nand, you know, marching with\n\npicket signs and all that jazz.\n\nI mean, what he really means,\n\nyou know.\n\nWhy you're afraid of him.\n\nThat's what it comes to.\n\nIf one could begin to examine\n\nthat, one might then begin to be\n\nable to deal with what is a\n\nreally quite simple matter,\n\nrelatively speaking.\n\nThat is to say, if one could\n\nexamine that, then the conundrum\n\nof the housing situation in\n\nSan Francisco will not be a\n\nconundrum because it is based on\n\nthat.\n\nAnd all the lies Americans tell\n\nthemselves and all the evasions\n\nthat they give themselves are\n\nbased on some fantastic escape,\n\npartly from Europe\n\nand then from the Indians\n\nand now, spectacularly, from me.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nWell, white liberals think\n\nof themselves as missionaries.\n\nI had a kind of fight once with\n\na very well-known white liberal.\n\nAnd I said, in the course\n\nof my conversation, something\n\nabout \"Mr. Charlie.\"\n\nThis man has been around for a\n\nlong, long time, and he said,\n\n\"Who's Mr. Charlie?\"\n\nAnd I was shocked that he didn't\n\nknow, you know, and I told him\n\nwho Mr. Charlie was.\n\nI said, \"You're Mr. Charlie.\n\nAll white men are Mr. Charlie.\"\n\nBut liberals have protected\n\nthemselves against this level of\n\nexperience because their\n\nprincipal motive has so far been\n\nas far as I can tell, a kind of\n\nalleviation of or protection\n\nof their own consciences.\n\nThey want to do something to\n\nhelp Negroes because it makes\n\nthem feel better, but the price\n\nthat they paid for this kind of\n\neffort is that they have never\n\ndiscovered who a Negro is --\n\nNot what, but who.\n\nOnly a liberal, for example,\n\ncould write the script to define\n\none.\n\nNo Negro could, you know.\n\nOnly a liberal can be offended,\n\nas John Fischer at\n\nHarper's Magazine is offended,\n\nwhen, you know, when Negroes\n\nmake some unmistakable\n\nindication that they're going --\n\nthat they don't want any more.\n\nThis is the record, you see.\n\nThey really think that, somehow,\n\nthe record of the Negro people's\n\nsurvival in this country\n\nis something on which they can\n\ncongratulate themselves.\n\nAnd they don't know that\n\nfor every one man who survived,\n\n20 perished, and that whatever\n\nthe Negroes manage to do here\n\nwas done against tremendous --\n\nthe tremendous abolition of the\n\npower structure.\n\nI don't mean there weren't some\n\nwhite people who managed, you\n\nknow, but in the generality,\n\nthis is the way it's been.\n\n>> Do you feel that the white\n\nliberal, a lot of times, that\n\nwhen things gets real tough,\n\nthat he can escape?\n\nI mean, he can revert back\n\ntomorrow.\n\n>> Oh, the white liberal,\n\nwhen things get tough...\n\nA white woman told me a few\n\nweeks ago, she had --\n\nShe had had the bad luck to be\n\nsitting in the same room with\n\nabout 20 students who were, you\n\nknow, telling it like it is.\n\nSterling Brown was there, and,\n\nuh, she was one of the few white\n\nliberals in the room.\n\nAnd what these kids were saying,\n\nin effect, was, you know,\n\n\"White people don't know enough\n\nabout us to be able to help us.\n\nYou know, white people say one\n\nthing and do another,\" and all\n\nof this is absolutely true.\n\nAnd she was terribly, terribly\n\nhurt, literally hurt.\n\nAnd she said, \"I'm sure I done\n\nmore for Negroes than they've\n\never done,\" and I got mad and I\n\nsaid, \"That's exactly what they\n\nwere saying -- they don't want\n\nyou to do anything for Negroes.\"\n\nYou know.\n\nThey want you to do it for you.\n\nAnd she said, \"Well, I'm not\n\nwilling to damage my child,\"\n\nshe says, and I said,\n\n\"Well, then forget it.\"\n\nAfter all, speaking for myself,\n\nyou know, it's kind of an\n\ninsult.\n\nHere I am, you know, as they\n\nsay, \"no visible scars.\"\n\nI'm not -- I'm not isolated.\n\nI got a family, you know...\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> ...and a history.\n\nAnd I got nieces and nephews.\n\nI can't protect them, you know.\n\nThey're in tremendous danger\n\nevery hour that they live\n\njust because they're black,\n\nnot because they're wicked,\n\nyou know.\n\nAnd I mean this from the baby\n\nniece to the oldest nephew,\n\nwho is soon gonna be 16.\n\nNow, if this is the way that\n\nthey are, you know, and I know\n\nthat every time I leave my\n\nnephew, I don't know what'll\n\nhappen to him by the time I see\n\nhim again, I mean, not only\n\ninside but physically...\n\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n>> How can you expect me to take\n\nseriously somebody who says,\n\n\"I'm willing to fight for you,\n\nbut I can't afford to let...\n\nI can't afford\n\nto let my children be damaged.\"\n\nAnd furthermore, how can I take\n\nseriously somebody who doesn't\n\nrealize that their children\n\nare being damaged by this,\n\nby the continuation of this\n\nsystem?\n\nYou can't, you know, you can't\n\nserve, as they say, two masters.\n\nYou know, the liberal can't be\n\nsafe and heroic, too.\n\n>> In other words, he wants it\n\nto come full-face if gets behind\n\nthe safety zone.\n\n>> Yes. That's right.\n\nThat's right.\n\nHe's with you but, um,\n\nnot when the going gets rough.\n\nAnd though, really,\n\nwhat I really mean about him\n\nis that he doesn't...\n\nIf you can think of in those\n\nterms and you don't see the\n\ngravity of the situation, you\n\ndon't see that we are living\n\nin a segregated society and this\n\ndoes terrible things to my child\n\nand does terrible things to your\n\nchild, too...\n\nIf you don't see that, then I\n\ndon't think you see anything.\n\nAnd most of the liberals do not\n\nsee that.\n\nOne of the great American\n\nillusions, one of the great\n\nAmerican necessities is to\n\nbelieve that I, poor benighted\n\nblack man whom they saved\n\nfrom...\n\n...elephant-ridden jungles of\n\nAfrica and to whom they brought\n\nthe Bible...\n\n...is still grateful for that.\n\nAnd people say,\n\nin many, many ways -- not only\n\nin the South, all over this\n\ncountry -- in effect, we should\n\nbe grateful, even slavery.\n\n\"They released you from that.\n\nYou're no longer dodging tsetse\n\nflies in some backward country.\"\n\nWell, I know this, and anyone\n\nwho's ever tried to live knows\n\nthis --\n\nthat what you say about somebody\n\nelse, you know, anybody else,\n\nreveals you.\n\nWhat I think of you as being\n\nis dictated by my own\n\nnecessities, my own psychology,\n\nmy own, um, fears and desires.\n\nI'm not describing you\n\nwhen I talk about you.\n\nI'm describing me.\n\nNow here, in this country,\n\nwe've got something called\n\na nigger.\n\nBut it doesn't, in such terms,\n\nI beg you to remark, exist in\n\nany other country in the world.\n\nWe have invented the nigger.\n\nI didn't invent him.\n\nWhite people invented him.\n\nI've always known --\n\nI had to know by the time I was\n\n17 years old that what you were\n\ndescribing was not me and what\n\nyou were afraid of was not me.\n\nIt had to be something else.\n\nYou had invented it.\n\nSo it had to be something you\n\nwere afraid of.\n\nYou invested me with it.\n\nNow, if that's so,\n\nno matter what you've done to\n\nme, I can say to you this.\n\nAnd I mean it.\n\nI know you can't do any more,\n\nand I've got nothing to lose.\n\nAnd I know, and I have always\n\nknown, you know, and really\n\nalways, that's probably agony.\n\nI've always known that I'm not a\n\nnigger.\n\nBut if I am not the nigger...\n\nAnd if it's true that your\n\ninvention reveals you...\n\n...then who is the nigger?\n\nI am not the victim here.\n\nI know one thing from another.\n\nI was born, and I'm gonna be --\n\nYou know, I was born, I'm gonna\n\nsuffer, and I'm gonna die.\n\nThe only way you can get through\n\nlife is to know the worst things\n\nabout it.\n\nI know that a person is more\n\nimportant than anything else.\n\nAnything else.\n\nI learned this because\n\nI've had to learn it.\n\nBut you still think, I gather,\n\nthat the nigger is necessary.\n\nWell, he's unnecessary to me.\n\nSo he must be necessary to you.\n\nAnd I give you your problem\n\nback.\n\nYou're the nigger, baby.\n\nIt isn't me.\n\n>> \"Take This Hammer,\"\n\nfilmed with James Baldwin in the\n\nspring of 1963, was produced for\n\nNational Educational Television\n\nby the KQED Film Unit,\n\nSan Francisco.\n\nThis is NET,\n\nNational Educational Television."
