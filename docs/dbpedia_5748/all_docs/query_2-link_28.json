        "text": "I used to be a James Cameron hater. I always preferred Alien over Aliens, thought Terminator 2 was overrated, hated The Abyss, thought the first half of Titanic was boring, and still can’t believe how popular Avatar is. So, leading up to the release of Avatar: The Way of Water, Cameron’s first directorial credit in 13 years, I was beyond skeptical.\n\n“There’s no way that this story could go anywhere interesting… stop making blockbusters out of everything… no one wants to see 4 more of these, just let the first one be special,” were all snippets of things I’ve said about these sequels since their announcement. But, with a flurry of insanely positive reviews coming from even the most hard-nosed critics, I was finally gaining a little bit of intrigue for the sequel, and I’m glad that I did.\n\nI’ve written a lot over the existence of this newsletter about how the journey of people should always take precedent within a story over the action and visuals. As most people do when they’re young, I used to pay more attention to the eye popping moments of movies than an adult would, which explains why Cameron wasn’t my cup of tea. In rewatching Avatar last week, in preparation for the sequel, I realized that Cameron makes blockbusters for adults — lovingly crafted characters with just the right amount of action, charged to coincide with the emotional connection we build with the people we’re watching. Despite covering topics and plot threads that we’ve seen in multiple movies before, he executes everything perfectly. Cameron someone who cares very much about making sure people see the strong side of themselves within his characters, leading to some of the most famous protagonists of all time.\n\nJames Cameron has been in hiatus for 13 years, but not because he wasn’t working. According to producer Jon Landau, the decision was finally made to return to Pandora in 2012 for four more installments, with Cameron putting together a writers room and developing the scripts before filming anything. Principal photography for motion capture in The Way of Water finally started in August 2017 (5 years after that decision to make sequels!), simultaneously shot alongside the third installment that began in September, filming taking place over a year before switching to nearly 7 months of live action filming in New Zealand.\n\nThe film is broken up into three acts across its 3 hour runtime. The first hour reestablishes the world we’ve been separated from for so long, introducing new characters and new status quos. The second hour is where the title comes from, bringing the viewer on a journey through gorgeous underwater vistas with insanely detailed sea creatures and fauna, delivering some of the greatest visual effects and motion capture work I’ve ever seen. The final hour brings everything together, raising the stakes to a crescendo that pays off in the most satisfying and gripping final act in a very long time, but that’s what James Cameron’s known for, so of course the finale lived up to expectations.\n\nThe technological innovations and the time that was taken to make sure every aspect of the film looked real is astounding. Close ups of hands on fully animated characters have palm prints, blemishes, and calluses that tell a story — there’s a close up of someones stomach where you can see little hairs shining in the sunlight. Underwater, each fish has a specific design, detailed enough to think you can reach out and touch them while wearing the 3D glasses. It’s even more breathtaking when you put it side-by-side with other blockbuster releases from the past year, all looking unfinished as they sprint towards a premeditated release date instead of making sure it’s finalized to everyone’s liking.\n\nWhile it’s not the best movie in Cameron’s filmography, Avatar: The Way of Water is told by a classic blockbuster filmmaker reminding us that the greatest thrill is caring about what we’re watching. I mentioned earlier how gripping the final act of the film is, and that can only be achieved with all the character work that’s explored in the first two hours. The Avatar films may not be for everyone, and I’m still not in love with this world as much as the next person, but it’s undeniable that we need more movies where a filmmaker can have all the time in the world to tell a story in the way they envision it. James Cameron was given that ability, and I can’t wait to see where he innovates next when he takes advantage of it again."
