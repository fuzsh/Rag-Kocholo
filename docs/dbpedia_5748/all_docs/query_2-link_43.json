The consensus was that \"Better Off Dead is an anarchic mix of black humor and surreal comedy, anchored by John Cusack's winsome, charming performance.\"[1] However, Siskel & Ebert gave the film two thumbs down.[2]\n\nAccording to Savage Steve Holland, Cusack did not like the film and walked out of a screening as both were making One Crazy Summer, later confronting Holland saying Better Off Dead \"was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don't speak to me.\" Holland claimed that Cusack felt he had been made to look foolish and that his comments \"made me not care about movies anymore\".[3] However, in a 2013 Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" chat, Cusack, when asked if he hated filming Better Off Dead, responded, \"No, I just thought it could have been better, but I think that about almost all my films. I have nothing against the film.... Glad people love it still\n\nRelease Date: August 23, 1985\n\nDomestic Total Gross: $10,297,601\n\nDomestic Total Adj. Gross: $25,091,300"
