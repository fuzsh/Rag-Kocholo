Here is how a typical challenge works:\n\nThree prompts.\n\nWhen a challenge begins, writers are given three prompts. Prompts vary by challenge, but can consist of a genre, action, character, location, object, subject, or word. These prompts need to be integrated into the story or screenplay you will write.\n\nA time limit.\n\nAll the challenges begin and end at 11:59 PM New York time, which is one minute before midnight—hence the name NYC Midnight. The challenges range from as little as 24 hours to 8 days to complete.\n\nWrite, edit, repeat.\n\nWith the prompts, a tight deadline, and a maximum word/page count, the challenge truly begins. The process of writing, editing, rewriting, and finally pressing submit with a brand new story or screenplay can be a very inspiring experience.\n\nKeep all the Rights.\n\nWriters retain all the rights to the work they create during the challenges, which means that we could not and would not share the submissions publicly without consent from the authors.\n\nFeedback on every submission.\n\nNot only does every writer receive feedback from the judges for every submission, but special review forums are available for the participants to submit their work for review from fellow writers.\n\nA Vibrant Writing Community.\n\nJoin over 27,000 writers in our online forum to discuss the challenges, post and review stories, and discuss writing in all facets. We are dedicated to providing a forum that is a welcoming and helpful place for writers of all levels. Click here to visit the forums.\n\nWriting for a Good Cause.\n\nWe are proud to support global charities dealing with some of the most critical issues facing our world. Two percent of each entry fee is donated to these charities, and writers can choose where their donation goes.\n\nWhat Our Participants Say\n\n“Just want to say that I am an English teacher, and NYC Midnight competitions have helped me grow as a writer more than any other writing conference, class, or activity I have taken part in. The random prompts, working in unfamiliar genres, the crazy deadlines, the feedback from judges--it's gold. I just won a national short story contest, and the things I learned during NYC helped me get here. Thanks for all you do. Thanks for letting us keep full rights to our stories. Looking forward to many more rounds.”\n\n— Kelli Fitzpatrick\n\nBeavorton, MI, USA\n\nWinning Stories\n\nRead winning short stories from previous challenges.\n\nSTORIES\n\nImprove Your Writing\n\nRead helpful topics about all aspects of writing on our blog."
