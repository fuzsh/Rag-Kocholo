        "text": "JUNE CASAGRANDE\n\nI like to think of this column as grammar for dummies by a dummy. But\n\ntoday, I’m taking it a step further and actually making it about\n\ndummies. No, I haven’t been watching FOX News or any Keanu Reeves\n\nmovies. I’ve been reading about grammar.\n\nYou see, after years of working as a copy editor and more than a\n\nyear and a half of writing this column, a few months ago I finally\n\nbought a real-live, bona fide grammar book. Until then, I’d been\n\nrelying on style books and usage books -- mainly the “Associated\n\nPress Stylebook,” which governs most newspapers, and the “Chicago\n\nManual of Style,” which sets the rules for book publishing, and\n\n“Garner’s Modern American Usage,” which tries to put the whole mess\n\nof modern language rules into perspective for the average user.\n\nThe stylebooks contain lots of useful stuff on style issues, such\n\nas whether to use a comma before “and” in a sentence such as, “I\n\nrelate to dummies, dinks and dolts.” The Associated Press frowns upon\n\nadding an extra comma, which is known as the “serial comma” or\n\n“Oxford comma.” Newsprint’s expensive, you know, and any extra\n\ncharacter could cause a line of text to wrap around one moment\n\nsooner, which in turn could cause the words to fill up the page\n\nsooner, which would be a tragedy. The “Chicago Manual of Style,”\n\nwhich shoots fast and loose with its adherents’ supply of ink and\n\npaper, supports the use of the extra comma.\n\nThese books also contain some practical stuff about grammar. But I\n\nnever realized how much they omitted until I coughed up 50-odd\n\ndollars for my impressive-looking copy of the “Oxford English\n\nGrammar.”\n\nWhen I began thumbing through this book, one of the first things\n\nthat caught my eye was the word “dummy.” It was like a warm welcome,\n\nthe equivalent of, “You, June Casagrande, are welcome here.” Of\n\ncourse, a moment later I felt even dumber because Oxford was talking\n\nabout a whole different kind of dummies. Specifically, what I was\n\nreading about were “dummy operators” and, as I read, I was\n\nincreasingly more embarrassed that I’d never known or even thought\n\nabout these dummies before.\n\nConsider the Oxford example statement, “It interferes with your\n\nlife,” turned into the question, “Does it interfere with your life?”\n\nNotice how, when we make a question, we sometimes throw in an extra\n\nword: “does” or “do” or “did” or something along those lines?\n\nDummy that I am, I never really noticed before this thing I now\n\nknow is called a “dummy operator.” And it’s a quirk of English that I\n\nmight have noticed while studying French or Spanish.\n\nIn those languages, you form a question just by swapping the order\n\nof the subject and verb. “It interferes” becomes “interferes it?”\n\nThey don’t have to add “do” or “did” -- dummy operators.\n\nTake pity on people who “no speak-a the English too good” because\n\nI’m here to tell you, the more I learn about English, the more I can\n\nsee that it’s cruel and unusual to anyone who didn’t begin learning\n\nit from birth.\n\nWhen we make a question out of, “You enjoy movies,” we don’t just\n\nsay, “Enjoy you movies?” We throw in the dummy operator “do” and\n\nthereby add a whole level of confusion. “Do you enjoy movies?” We\n\ndon’t change, “I walk in the park,” to, “Walk I in the park?” We say,\n\n“Do I walk in the park?”\n\nJust to be even more cruel and unusual, the dummy-operator rule\n\nisn’t so hard-and-fast. You can form a question out of, “I have\n\nbooks,” without a dummy operator, “Have I books?” But walking around\n\ntalking like one of Sir Lancelot’s court in this day and age gives\n\nyet another whole new meaning to the word “dummy.”\n\n* JUNE CASAGRANDE is a freelance writer.
