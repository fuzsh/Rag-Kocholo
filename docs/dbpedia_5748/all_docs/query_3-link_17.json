[More]\n\nDirected By: Fede Alvarez\n\n#11\n\nLonglegs (2024) 86%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 105122%\n\nCritics Consensus: Saturated in disquieting mood while leveraging a nightmarishly gonzo performance by Nicolas Cage, Longlegs is a satanic horror that effectively instills panic.\n\nSynopsis: In pursuit of a serial killer, an FBI agent uncovers a series of occult clues that she must solve to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Oz Perkins\n\n#12\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 29167%\n\nCritics Consensus: A high-concept treatment that misses out on the blissful simplicity of its source material, Harold and the Purple Crayon is a tribute to imagination that's content to only color inside the lines.\n\nSynopsis: Inside of his book, adventurous Harold (Zachary Levi) can make anything come to life simply by drawing it. After he...
