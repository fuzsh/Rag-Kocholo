        "text": "“In 1964, Henri-Georges Clouzot, the acclaimed director of thriller masterpieces Les Diaboliques and Wages of Fear, began work on his most ambitious film yet.\n\nSet in a beautiful lake side resort in the Auvergne region of France, L’Enfer (Inferno) was to be a sun scorched elucidation on the dark depths of jealousy starring Romy Schneider as the harassed wife of a controlling hotel manager (Serge Reggiani). However, despite huge expectations, major studio backing and an unlimited budget, after three weeks the production collapsed under the weight of arguments, technical complications and illness.\n\nIn this compelling, award-winning documentary Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea present Inferno’s incredible expressionistic original rushes, screen tests, and on-location footage, whilst also reconstructing Clouzot’s original vision, and shedding light on the ill-fated endeavour through interviews, dramatizations of unfilmed scenes, and Clouzot’s own notes.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS\n\n• High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation\n\n• Original 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\n\n• Optional English subtitles\n\n• Lucy Mazdon on Henri-Georges Clouzot, the French cinema expert and academic talks at length about the films of Clouzot and the troubled production of Inferno\n\n• They Saw Inferno, a featurette including unseen material, providing further insight into the production of Inferno\n\n• Filmed Introduction by Serge Bromberg\n\n• Interview with Serge Bromberg\n\n• Stills gallery\n\n• Original trailer\n\n• Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Twins of Evil\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Ginette Vincendeau"
