        "text": "“This assemblage of lost footage is perhaps more fascinating than the actual completed film would have been” -- Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian\n\nIn 1964, Henri-Georges Clouzot, the acclaimed director of thriller masterpieces DIABOLIQUE and THE WAGES OF FEAR, began work on his most ambitious film yet. Set in a beautiful lakeside resort, L’ENFER (INFERNO) was to be a sun-scorched look at the dark depths of jealousy starring Romy Schneider as the harassed wife of a controlling hotel manager. Despite huge expectations, major studio backing and an unlimited budget, after three weeks the production collapsed under the weight of arguments, technical complications and illness.\n\nIn this award-winning documentary, archivists Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea present INFERNO’s incredible expressionistic original rushes, screen tests and on-location footage, whilst also reconstructing Clouzot’s original vision and shedding light on the ill-fated endeavour through interviews, dramatisations of unfilmed scenes and Clouzot’s own notes."
