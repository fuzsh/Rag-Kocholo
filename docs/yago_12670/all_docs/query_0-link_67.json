But Christina is tired of her husband’s abusive behaviour towards her and his womanising. Michel’s mistress, Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), is equally fed up with his brutal behaviour towards her, and so the two women team up and decide to kill him by drowning him while making it appear as a suicide. When the body goes missing and sightings of the supposedly dead man are reported all over the city, the two women begin to panic. They must uncover what happened to the body, either before it is discovered or the interfering private detective (Inspector Fichet/Charles Vanel) unravels the women’s plot. It transpires that the whole plot is a hoax invented by Michel and Nicole to put sufficient stress on Christina’s heart and cause her to die of a heart attack. They succeed in causing her death (basically, by terrorising her). However, Inspector Fichet is on the ball and he catches them out, almost literally red-handed. Upon its release, the director HenriGeorges Clouzot urged all who saw the film not to reveal its surprise ending – one that still stands as one of the original ‘shock’ endings.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot (1907–1977): the man in focus Henri-Georges Clouzot made only ten feature-length films.1 Four of them won international prizes.2 His first film, released in 1942, L’Assassin habite au 21, was a thriller – as was his last, La Prisonnière (1968). And the thriller is the genre we most readily associate with him. But not just any thriller. His take on the genre is dark, relentless, stifling, cruel. He strips away the mask of hypocrisy, shows life ‘as it is’, where people are weak and unable to change in a world that does not change. Clouzot’s own life was dogged by illness and tragedy and it is only too easy to read the threatening nature of his thrillers through the optic of his personal life.3 But, of course, that is only part of the story. What follows is an outline of this career. Becoming a man of cinema 1907–1941 Henri-Georges Clouzot was born in the small provincial town of Niort (in south-western France) in 1907. By all accounts, his mother was a perfectionist and his father a failed businessman.4 In 1922 his father was forced, through bankruptcy, to sell the family bookshop (in existence since 1836) and move his family to Brest. Clouzot’s own life was also marked by this double edge of perfection and failure. Once in Brest he entered the Naval School, but was forced out because of his myopia. He then left for Paris to study diplomacy (by now he was 18 years old). Again he failed, this time because he did not come from money – as he puts it, he was ‘quickly made aware that one doesn’t belong’.5 However, from these two early experiences he learned that he was drawn to the cinema and that he liked ‘playing hide and seek with words, ideas and people’.6 He then turned his hand, first, to theatre and, subsequently, to cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter.7 His success was modest. However, by the early 1930s he was working for Film Sonores Tobis\n\n2\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\n(a Paris outlet of the German studios Universum Film AG), and in 1932 he was brought to Berlin to work on the French dialogue for the doubleversion films being made at Babelsberg Studios.8 He lasted there for two years, after which he was sent home because, according to Clouzot, he got ‘too friendly with one of his producers who was a Jew’.9 The Berlin experience left its mark on Clouzot. He met Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau. He developed a taste for German expressionist films, in particular the contrastive chiaroscuro lighting. Within a year of his return to Paris, however, he became seriously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis. This serious illness gave him ‘a taste of death’10 in his mouth – and he spent the next three years in various private sanatoriums, paid for thanks to friends who rallied round to support him. In 1938 he returned to Paris and befriended the actor Pierre Fresnay, who helped to get him back into the cinema business. In this same year he met the actor and singer Suzy Delair (who worked with Fresnay), with whom he had a 12-year relationship (she eventually left him after working with him on Quai des Orfèvres, 1947). The auteur-metteur-en-scène has arrived 1941–1944 By 1940 France was an occupied nation; the Nazis controlled the northern half, and the southern half was governed by a German puppet regime (the Vichy government). Despite these difficult times, 1941 was the first major turning point for Clouzot. This was the year that the French film industry came under German control. Alfred Greven, the head of the German Continental Studios’ branch in Paris (which now controlled all Paris-based studios), set up the Comité d’Organisation de l’Industrie Cinématographique (COIC) to manage the industry. Greven knew Clouzot from his Berlin days and asked him to direct the scriptwriting service at Continental. At first Clouzot declined, but then hunger and unemployment drove him to accept. His first adaptation, in his new capacity as director of screenwriting, was Georges Simenon’s Les Inconnus dans la maison (Henri Decoin, 1942). Most significantly, he made the story blacker than the original – thus setting a trend for his own films to come, whereby he would considerably rewrite and make darker the original novel text. Interestingly, Stanislas-André Steeman – an author whom Clouzot used twice (L’Assassin habite au 21 and Quai des Orfèvres) – felt that Clouzot was someone who would never be an adaptor\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nand who could only ‘build something after having contemptuously demolished any resemblance to the original, purely for the ambition of effect’.11 This suggests not just a desire to impose an authorial stamp on the text but also an element of violence in Clouzot’s working practice – one that Clouzot would see as closely identified with cinema. He once compared theatregoing with cinema in the following terms. ‘On stage, it’s like tennis, a very fast game which demands action from both sides’ (the spectator and the actors), whereas cinema was the exact opposite: ‘The spectator is placed in a situation where he might react at the beginning of the film but where his face is being punched repeatedly and as quickly as possible to annihilate him.’12 A fairly brutal experience, then! Clouzot was unimpressed by Decoin’s film (based on his script) and so decided to turn his hand to directing himself. In this he was considerably enabled by the support of the popular screen couple Pierre Fresnay (his friend) and Suzy Delair (his lover), who agreed to be in his film. With L’Assassin habite au 21 Clouzot undoubtedly cut his teeth as a filmmaker. He learned his craft the hard way. During the Occupation resources were extremely limited. As Suzy Delair explains, ‘You only had two takes, so you had to be good.’ 13 So Clouzot meticulously planned his film. He had a tight storyboard that had to be closely followed, and this allowed him, first, to work out how much studio space and what types of sets he would need and, second, to establish all the shots ahead of time. The result: the film was made in 16 days and cost virtually nothing. Clouzot’s style, then, was a lean, sparse style. As the set designer Max Douy explains: ‘(He) made just what was needed, neither more nor less.’14 Yet it was also always authentic. Clouzot could not abide anything that smelled of pretence.15 And this leanness and authenticity also applied to his technique with his actors. He could not bear fabrication; the actor had to inhabit the moment. In order to get the effect he wanted (be it anger or tears) he would quarrel with actors, slap them – in short, shock them into the mood required.16 Effectively, Clouzot wanted to strip his actors down to the bare bones of their acting, make them raw so that what they showed became more important than what they said. And he achieved this starkness (a cruel authenticity), first, by looking into each actor to discover what would serve his purpose, second, by exploiting their strengths and weaknesses and, third, by telling them what he wanted and making them rehearse until it was right. He was the boss, and he was tough and a perfectionist.\n\n4\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nIt was his second film, Le Corbeau (1943), which gained him the epithet of auteur-metteur-en-scène17 but which also brought a heap of opprobrium onto his head. It was Cocteau who gave him this label, not only because he liked the film but because he perceived Clouzot’s genius as both a master of mise en scène and the ubiquitous author of his film text. This notion of auteur-metteur-en-scène predates the ‘auteur’ debates of the 1950s, but it does point (unlike the single term ‘auteur’) to the extent of the labour involved in such an undertaking. Interestingly, the actor Louis Jouvet, who worked with Clouzot on Quai des Orfèvres and who also used this epithet, saw it as a more problematic dynamic than Cocteau. He saw a tension for Clouzot between the auteur and the metteur-en-scène; the dynamic of having to resolve technical issues and keep to his text made him over-preoccupied and in conflict with himself, in Jouvet’s view.18 Arguably, this tension is what gives an added edge of unease in Clouzot’s films, making them more knifeedged than if he had been not been in conflict with himself. Clouzot’s film was inspired by Louis Chavance’s 1937 script entitled L’Oeil du serpent, which was based on the Tulle affair (1922). Tulle is a small provincial town, and the affair involved a woman, Angèle Laval, who penned over 1,000 anonymous letters, signing them ‘l’Oeil du Tigre’. Clouzot was fascinated by this story and wanted to make the film. Continental had reservations about it because, by 1943, letters of denunciation had become rife (after the war the number was estimated at some three million). This was precisely why Clouzot wanted to make the film; he was fed up with all the anonymous letters and wanted to denounce the practice.19 The film was hit by controversy. Clouzot rowed with Greven and quit Continental two days before the première of his film. The film itself was so controversial and the publicity campaign so inflammatory that the German distributors ACE withdrew it from distribution in France. It was seen only in Switzerland and Belgium.20 From auteur maudit to auteur noir to auteur no more 1944–1968 In 1944, when France was liberated, numerous people (among them film industry personnel) were brought before the Comité d’épuration (the ‘Cleansing Committee’) accused of acts of collaboration with the enemy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nClouzot was one of the accused, because he had worked for Continental (despite the fact that he had helped Jewish personnel and hid resistors).21 He was banned from working in the industry for four years. His initial punishment was two years but a further two years were added. In the end he served just over three out of the four years. It is not difficult to see that he was punished as much for his working with Continental as he was for his film Le Corbeau.22 The left perceived the film as a betrayal of the image of La France Résistante, the right saw it as anti-French propaganda. Interestingly Jean-Paul Sartre,23 Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bost (all people of the left) sent a letter protesting against the sentence. To no avail.24 Clouzot became an auteur maudit. It is worth making the point that Clouzot is rather difficult to pin down politically. He has been identified as a man of the right and yet he had as many associations with people of the left (for example, Simone Signoret, Yves Montand, Serge Reggiani, Sartre, de Beauvoir) as he had connections with the right (Pierre Fresnay being the most significant one). For this reason Clouzot remains ambiguous – which is why, of course, Le Corbeau met with such a double-edged response and contradictory reading. Despite the ban, Clouzot continued to work in private on his next film project, Quai des Orfèvres. In this and his next film, Manon (1949),25 Clouzot refined his system of working with actors. Louis Jouvet, who starred as the detective inspector in Quai des Orfèvres, provides interesting insights into Clouzot’s craft as a director. ‘What dominates with Clouzot is his lucidity. He explains the scene with amazing clarity. It is as if he were projecting the scene for you on the screen.’ In short, Jouvet tells us, Clouzot’s facility for taking away the ‘technical jargon’ made his actors feel secure.26 This demystifying can be seen as part of Clouzot’s economy of production practices. It saved on time and film. This does not mean that he was an easy director to work with, as we have seen. And we get a further sense of this when we recall how he left nothing to chance. Take, for example, his statement that ‘to film an event there is only one placing of the camera. Once found, the rest follows.’27 This apparent rigidity needs to be nuanced, however. While he would indeed shoot his chosen way, he was not impervious to listening to his actors if they thought there was another way to shoot the scene. According to Serge Reggiani (who worked with him on Manon), he would shoot both ways and choose the best shots. He could listen and negotiate – at least with the men, so Reggiani tells us. This was less the case\n\n6\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nfor his female actors, with whom he was, to quote Reggiani, ‘somewhat misogynistic’.28 A further way of understanding Clouzot’s directorial style, which is particularly helpful when considering Les Diaboliques, is provided by Philippe Pilard’s suggestion that he brought character and actor together and did not force the one into the other.29 What Clouzot was not looking for, then, was a situation where the character inhabits the actor, but more one where actor, character, mise en scène and plot are in some kind of dramatic tension with the purpose, generally, of creating suspense – a practice not dissimilar, it could be argued, to the other master of suspense of this same period, Alfred Hitchcock. However, given that one of Clouzot’s stars in Les Diaboliques, Simone Signoret, was well known for being an actor whose being was literally inhabited by the character, we can perhaps understand why there were difficulties for her in embodying a scheming murderer who was pretending not to be one! As Signoret herself explains, in order to make the plot of the film work she was supposed to act as if she were not the duplicitous schemer she was. However, she found it almost impossible, from the start, not to act her role as one who was guilty.30 Pilard also points out the other great strength of Clouzot’s directorial style in that he made his characters real by bringing them into a situation which, at first, is fairly banal but which he pushes into the unbelievable.31 A good example of this is the love triangle in Les Diaboliques, itself quite an ordinary, banal occurrence. However, as one of the schoolmasters rightly remarks, it is inconceivable that the two women (the wife Christina and the mistress Nicole) should be friends (which they are) when they should be rivals and enemies. But, of course, if the unbelievable were not made believable the plot simply would not work. After the great success of Quai des Orfèvres (Cannes Best Director; a 5.5 million audience) and the slightly more modest, but still considerable one of Manon (Venice Golden Lion; 3.4 million spectators), Clouzot encountered the first of his real failures. He turned his hand to making a period comedy Miquette et sa mère (1950) – an adaptation of a stage play. An unusual departure, one might think, for someone so invested in portraying the dark side of life. But more unusual still when one considers that Clouzot thought that theatre was ill-suited to screen adaptation.32 Nonetheless, it was during the shooting of this film that he met and fell in love with his future wife,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nVera Gibson Amado. They were soon married (1950), and then they took off to Brazil, Vera’s native country. There, thanks to his wife’s deeply superstitious nature and interest in the occult, he was introduced to voodoo practices. The Brazilian experience was to influence greatly Clouzot’s take on his next project, Le Salaire de la peur, in which his wife had a role and which she helped to produce. Clouzot set up a production company named Vera Films and thereafter his wife was involved in his filmmaking practice until her untimely death (of a heart attack) in 1960. New precisions came into Clouzot’s filmmaking craft as a result of Salaire – almost a final fine-tuning. Here he learned to accentuate contrasts and did so primarily on the level of narrative, editing (as a system of ‘permanent shocks’),33 image (in terms of volume and planes) and lighting (the ‘chiaroscuro’ he had learned from Germany). Although Clouzot still adhered to his strict production practices, it is from this film on that he began to experience difficulties in meeting his deadlines. Recurrent illness dogged him until the end of his career, but other factors affected his output as well. Salaire produced many delays. Clouzot had opted for the Camargue region to simulate Venezuela as a way of keeping costs low.34 But bad weather, illness and accidents prevented the film from being shot within the designated nine weeks (September–October 1951). Things were brought to a halt by end-November and finishing the shoot had to be postponed by seven months. The original budget was doubled. Nonetheless, the film was acclaimed at Cannes in 1953, where it won the Grand Prix du Jury and earned international success (a 6.9 million audience in France).35 In a similar vein Les Diaboliques also suffered considerable delays, albeit less than Salaire. Shooting took 16 rather than eight weeks to complete (see Chapter 1 for more details). Clouzot was never again to attain the heights of these two great hits.36 Although they are undoubtedly masterpieces of suspense and earned him the epithet of auteur noir he was never to know such acclaim again.37 His failing was twofold. First, instead of capitalising on his successes by making a further thriller, Clouzot (strangely) made a film on his friend Pablo Picasso (Le Mystère Picasso, 1956). Second, he failed to realise that, by crafting his films in much the same way as before, he had misunderstood the changing climate of the times and the advent of a young people’s cinema – soon to be known as la nouvelle vague – heralded in part by the work of young filmmakers such as Roger Vadim (Et Dieu … créa la femme, 1956, starring Brigitte\n\n8\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nBardot) and Louis Malle (Les Amants, 1958). Clouzot’s next feature film did not come out until 1957 – Les Espions, a Cold War thriller – and it was, by Clouzot’s standards, a failure (a 1.8 million audience). Critics saw it as both too confusing and old hat.38 Indeed, in some ways the set and mise en scène are rather reminiscent of Les Diaboliques; it is a damp and dirty environment. Moreover, the spy narrative and characterisation seem to have more in common with Alice in Wonderland than with anything vaguely coherent. Critics were not much more persuaded by Clouzot’s 1960 film La Vérité (co-scripted by his wife just before she died). In its classical narrative line (the love triangle) and traditional editing style it did not sit well when set against the vibrancy of the nouvelle vague. However, with its top-billed stars Brigitte Bardot and Sami Frey it nonetheless appealed to young audiences and it was a great commercial success (5.7 million spectators). Clouzot’s next project was never completed due to a heart attack (L’Enfer, due out in 1964). And his last feature film, La Prisonnière (1968), was also something of a flop (a 1.3 million audience). Old-fashioned, stuck in his practices and uninventive and seemingly having lost his touch, the nouvelle vague consigned him thus to the purgatorial ranks of the cinéma de papa, and Clouzot was an auteur no more.\n\nConclusion Yet Clouzot was an auteur, and, with the passage of time, he has become recognised as one.39 He was the master of suspense through mise en scène and, as such, merits the frequent comparisons drawn between his work and Hitchcock’s. Much like Hitchcock’s work, Clouzot’s films were ‘not a question of realism, nor of truth, but a sort of reality created within and by the film itself ’.40 As with Hitchcock, the focus on detail is there, always, whether it be in the soundtrack, the décor or the costumes. Although he once stated that he ‘lacked something Hitchcock and Billy Wilder have, a sense of humour’, he certainly was not intending to make a modest remark.41 Hitchcock’s humour is lighter, more playful. Clouzot’s is dark, slightly nasty. Furthermore, in terms of difference, Clouzot’s working with mise en scène is bleaker, more oppressively detailed and, therefore, darker in its horror than Hitchcock’s. It is also more decrepit – not for him the glamorised settings or characters\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nwe often find in Hitchcock’s work. Many of Clouzot’s characters, like the settings, are redolent with decay – certainly deprived of glamour. Where the two filmmakers do rejoin, however, as Clouzot readily acknowledges, is in their preoccupation with ‘certain violent elements’.42 The cruelty of Les Diaboliques resonates well with that of Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963), and the mounting terror in Clouzot’s film easily anticipates Psycho (1960). Furthermore, in terms of his auteur status, it is worth looking at his overall filmmaking practice. Generally speaking, Clouzot had total control of his film from script through storyboard to shooting script, and from script to final product. In most cases, he radically altered the original and adapted the text to make it his own. He mixed studio practice with location shooting and did so effectively at a time when location shooting was not common. Paradoxically, although rigid and meticulous in his preparations, he was able to be flexible once shooting and then editing took place.43 He worked with a fairly constant team of technicians and actors, beginning, most importantly, with the camera operator Armand Thirard, who taught him his craft.44 Thirard was Clouzot’s director of photography on seven out of his ten feature films.45 William-Robert Sivel was his sound operator in all but one film. Clouzot’s scriptwriter brother Jean (under the pseudonym of Jérôme Géronimi) assisted him on four of his films. Most of the art directors Clouzot worked with came from the pre-war poetic realist tradition. Both Andrei Andrejew and Max Douy, respectively, were associated with three of his films. Georges Wakhévitch designed Miquette et sa mère. Léon Barsacq was responsible for the sets of Les Diaboliques. In terms of actors, he regularly used Pierre Larquey and Noël Roquevert in secondary roles. Pierre Fresnay, Suzy Delair and Louis Jouvet were recurring star personas in his films until quarrels (Fresnay and Delair) or death (Jouvet) made them no longer accessible. His wife, Vera, starred in three of his films. Although she was not a trained actor she was determined to star in his films, and, thanks to their continuing appeal, she is still – along with the stars listed above, as well as Paul Meurisse, Yves Montand and Simone Signoret – a known name (albeit an actor of limited talent). With Clouzot we are confronted with the master of making the banal unbelievable – and he achieves this, as we noted, by pushing a trivial situation to its limits. Not satisfied with this act of transformation alone, Clouzot takes us one step further and proceeds to make the unbelievable the\n\n10\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\ncentral focus of his films while at the same time getting us to suspend disbelief. In other words, the narrative and events therein, although fundamentally and rationally unbelievable, are systematically naturalised and pass as normal. A brilliant masquerade! And it is in this sleight of hand that he thrills us all, and chills us to the bone. As the trailer advertising the release of Les Diaboliques immodestly makes clear, with each film his ability to frighten us gets better: ‘More mysterious than Le Corbeau! More fascinating than Quai des Orfèvres! More spellbinding than Manon! More terrifying than Le Salaire de la peur!…Les Diaboliques!’46\n\nNotes 1 2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\n8\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\n16\n\nIn the 1960s he also made a series of musical documentaries for television, filming the orchestral concerts of conductor Herbert von Karajan. Cannes Best Director for Quai des Orfèvres (1947); Venice Golden Lion and Méliès for Manon (1949); Cannes Grand Prix for Le Salaire de la peur (1953) – Charles Vanel won Best Male Actor; Delluc for Les Diaboliques (1955). As Stanley Goulder in his review of Les Diaboliques makes clear: ‘[F]or Clouzot, as for Buñuel, death is never serene…’; ‘The necrophilist’, in Films and Filming 1 (10), 1955, p. 8. Bocquet, Jose-Louis (1993), p. 8. Henri-Georges Clouzot, quoted in Bocquet, (1993), p. 9. Clouzot, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 9. In 1934 he wrote a song for Marianne Oswald (a refugee from Moselle), Jeu de massacre, which was a great hit (Bocquet (1993), p. 16). The tone of violence in Clouzot’s lyrics should not escape our notice, however. At that time, with the advent of sound, studios needed to produce multiple language versions of their films for export. UFA was no exception, and was one of the strongest competitors to the American studios (for example, Paramount had Paris-based studios producing multi-lingual versions of their films). Clouzot, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 16. Clouzot, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 17. Stanislas-André Steeman, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 44; my emphasis. Clouzot, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 59. Suzy Delair, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 28. Max Douy, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 46. For example, even though his film Le Salaire de la peur was shot in the Camargue because there was not enough money to go to Venezuela, Clouzot insisted that sets and props be as authentic as possible – to the extent that Charles Vanel had to be immersed in real crude oil when he was rescued by Yves Montand. Clouzot refused to go for the soft option of coloured water. His ‘brutality’ knew no bounds, it would appear. He regularly slapped not only women actors – as Suzy Delair can testify (Bocquet (1993), p. 29) – but also\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17 18 19 20\n\n21 22\n\n23\n\n24 25\n\n26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34\n\n35\n\n11\n\nmen (Bertrand Blier in Quai des Orfèvres, for example (ibid., p. 47). To get the effect he wanted from Brigitte Bardot for the murder scene in La Vérité (1960), he got her drunk and then proceeded to slap her until she cried hysterically (see notes in Edinburgh Film Festival Catalogue 57, 2003, p. 126).

For more details, see Bocquet (1993), p. 38. Clouzot made only two films with Continental. Compare that figure with the number of films made with Continental by some of his French contemporaries: Decoin made three, Tourneur four, Cayatte four and Pottier five. All but Cayatte (who was not sanctioned) got a seven-or eight-month ban (BertinMaghit, Jean-Pierre (1989), p. 406 passim.). In 1943 Clouzot worked for three months with Sartre on a script for a film Chambre obscure, which never came to anything. Neither of them was satisfied with it. But it sealed a friendship. Bocquet (1993), p. 38. This strange updating of the narrative into the near-contemporary has Manon being transported on a boat taking Jews in secret to Palestine (rather than Louisiana, as in the novel). There she meets her death, as do the Jews, who are massacred by the Arabs. Needless to say, the reaction to this film from the left was one of considerable outrage and Clouzot was accused of anti-semitism (for details of reviews of this film, see Avant-scène du cinéma 463, 1997, p. 6). But it is worth making the point that, just because he was a man of the right, this did not mean that he did not hold liberal beliefs. In Quai des Orfèvres he paints an amazing portrait (for its time) of Jouvet as the father of a mixed-race son upon whom he dotes. He had wanted to make a film on the Algerian situation, giving all sides of the question, but the proposal was effectively sidelined by producers when they asked for too many changes to the original idea (see Clouzot, quoted in Avant-scène du cinéma 463, 1997, pp. 105–106). He had also wanted to make a film on Indochina but was blocked (Bocquet [1993], p. 87). Nor did he behave dishonourably during the Occupation. Jouvet, quoted in Bocquet (1993), p. 46.

But Yves Montand, one of his stars, refused on the basis that he could not work in a country under Franco’s dictatorship. So the Camargue was the compromise. For more details, see Yves Montand’s recollection, in Hamon, Hervé and Rotman, Patrick (1990), pp. 176–183.\n\n12\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\n36 Le Salaire de la peur obtained an audience of 6.9 million and Les Diaboliques netted 3.7 million spectators. 37 The term ‘auteur noir’, ascribed to Clouzot, is quoted by Pilard (1969), p. 18 and Bocquet (1993), p. 51. 38 The critic Henri Jeanson even went so far as to say that Clouzot ‘had done a Kafka in his pants’ (quoted in Avant-scène du cinéma 463, 1997, p. 10). 39 Clouzot’s achieving auteur status was internationally consecrated by the 2003 Edinburgh Festival (see notes in Edinburgh Film Festival Catalogue, 57, 2003, pp. 114–127). 40 Clouzot, quoted in Pilard (1969), p. 42. 41 Clouzot, quoted in Pilard (1969), p. 42. 42 Clouzot, quoted in Kemp, Philip ‘Hitching posts’, Metro Magazine 105, 1996, p. 34. 43 He is quoted as saying: ‘No matter how much I prepare in advance, I am always modifying on the set, to say nothing of when editing’; Pilard (1969), pp. 50–51. 44 Bocquet (1993), p. 28. 45 A little note of irony: Thirard was Vadim’s director of photography for Et Dieu …créa la femme. Clearly, he was capable of being modern even though his great partner Clouzot apparently was not. 46 Details of these trailers can be found on the DVD of Les Diaboliques (‘C’est la vie’ TF1, copyright 2002).\n\n1\n\nProduction contexts\n\nObtaining the rights and adapting the novel Clouzot’s adaptation of Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac’s Celle qui n’était plus (She who was no more, 1952), Les Diaboliques, was one of his greatest commercial successes. Some say it was his masterpiece – certainly, it is one of the most terrifying films ever made.1 Clouzot was always on the outlook for novels to adapt. An inveterate insomniac, he had plenty of time to devour books by the dozen, even though he passed the job of the initial selection onto his wife Vera.2 It was she who, having once read Boileau and Narcejac’s novel, persuaded him to obtain the rights.3 He did so and blocked those rights for a year, thus effectively preventing Alfred Hitchcock from getting his hands on the story. This novel was the first in a string of successful collaborative works by Boileau and Narcejac – and Hitchcock did not have to wait long before their third novel, D’Entre les morts (From the Dead) was made available to him and became his own masterpiece, Vertigo (1958). Undoubtedly Hitchcock’s adaptation bears a stronger resemblance to the original story than does Clouzot’s. But, as we know, Clouzot only used the original as a starting point, as an idea for where he wanted to go. In this case it was ‘the idea of a hoax’ that attracted him.4 In the original story, just as in Clouzot’s version, we are bamboozled until the end. The title of the film took some time to refine. Originally it was to be called Les Veuves/The Widows. Eleven weeks into shooting the title was changed to Les Démoniaques. Neither title seemed viable. Eventually Clouzot\n\n14\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\ncame up with Les Diaboliques. But, because this title already referred to a collection of short stories by the 19th-century author Barbey d’Aurevilly, Clouzot was given permission to use the title only on the condition that he paid homage to its originator. This he does by quoting d’Aurevilly in the opening credit sequence.5 D’Aurevilly’s text, which consists of a series of rather scabrous stories about women, rather outstrips in nastiness and vulgarity Clouzot’s own film. The stories are quite close to pornography (at least, for the time), and are as much about the desire of men to vanquish women as they are about the diabolical nature of women, who will stop at nothing to ensnare and victimise their man.6 Clouzot did not find the adaptation of Boileau and Narcejeac’s novel at all easy, primarily because he wanted to give his wife a really good role to make up for her small part in Le Salaire de la peur. But the original did not lend itself to a great role for her since the primary female figure was a doctor with decidedly ‘masculine’ ways, who, as it transpires by the end of the novel, is a lesbian. In other words, that particular role, of a tough, conniving mistress, was far too estranged from Vera Clouzot’s physically fragile and distinctly feminine person. The only other female character in the novel was the supposed victim, Mireille, and she hardly had a role at all. Clouzot struggled for 18 months until he and his co-scriptwriter brother (Jean, aka Jérôme Géronimi) came up with the idea of locating the story in a boys’ boarding school.7 This freed his thinking and allowed him to reconstruct the triangular relationship in a completely different manner. In the novel, it is the two women – Lucienne the doctor, and Mireille the wife – who are in reality plotting to do away with the husband, Ravinel. Unbeknown to Ravinel (who is working under the assumption that Lucienne is only his mistress), it is in fact the two women who are lovers. Their scheme is to terrorise him into having a heart attack so they can get their hands on his life insurance policy and run away to the sunny south of France. The hoax (in relation to the reader) is that Ravinel and Lucienne appear to be plotting to kill Mireille. However, at the end of the novel it transpires that Mireille’s death has been faked. So the mysterious notes left around the house for her husband to discover and the odd noises are not Mireille’s ghost, as Ravinel believes (as he goes increasingly insane and becomes physically weaker), but in fact the real Mireille. In the end, unable to stand the guilt any longer, he commits suicide. Thankfully for the women, this eventuality (suicide) will not prevent\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n15\n\nthem from getting the money because it is covered by a two-year exclusion clause (after the first two years the policy will cover the person’s death, no matter what the cause). Clouzot decided to reverse the tale, and in his script (as already mentioned) it is the husband and his mistress who plot against the wife (who is now the one with the weak heart). But we do not realise this until the very end of the film, when they successfully bring about her collapse and death by terrorising her. We have a similar triangle to the novel, but a different set of dynamics. The wife, Christina (Vera Clouzot), is married to the ruthless and sadistic headmaster Michel (Paul Meurisse), with whom she runs a private boarding school just outside Paris. Nicole (Simone Signoret), the mistress, is a science teacher. To all appearances Nicole and Christina have ganged up against Michel because he behaves so brutally towards them both. They enter into a complicit relationship against him and ostensibly seem to be plotting to do away with him. They drug him, drown him in a bathtub, throw him into a swimming pool and leave him for dead. But, like a ghost, he returns to haunt Christina and, eventually, she succumbs to a heart attack. In order to give his wife a big enough part, Clouzot completely inverted the sexual dynamics and heterosexualised the original text. It is not necessarily the case, however, that Clouzot ‘erased’ the lesbian element because of the especially homophobic nature of the period, or because of concerns about censorship. He had, after all, introduced a lesbian character into his film Quai des Orfèvres (who did not exist in the original novel). So he was not afraid, as Judith Mayne points out, to deal with questions of sexuality and gender.8 And, as we shall see, Clouzot was unable to (or chose not to?) delete completely the lesbian thread of the original text. For now, suffice it to say that the effect of ‘straightening’ the text meant that Vera Clouzot now occupied Ravinel’s original place and Paul Meurisse took on Mireille’s. Small wonder Boileau and Narcejac were somewhat put out. In Narcejac’s view, Clouzot had made the story brutal, a mass that ‘knocks you out’ – suggesting, through his choice of words, that the delicateness of the queer in the novel has been erased and replaced by the thuggery of the heterosexual in the film. He was also of the opinion that, whereas Celle qui n’était plus was like euthanasia, in Les Diaboliques it was out and out murder.9 The tone is certainly more violent in the film than in the novel, reminding us of Clouzot’s words about the cinematic experience and its resemblance, to his mind, to a boxing match.10\n\n16\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nCasting Having already decided to cast Vera in the role of Christina, Clouzot needed to make sure he had the right kind of support to help carry her through such a developed role. He turned to Simone Signoret, who, along with her husband Yves Montand, he had somehow managed to befriend. Their friendship was by all accounts a tumultuous one – unsurprisingly, since they came from opposite sides of the political spectrum – but one which was forged during holidays spent in Saint-Paul de Vence (in the south of France) and, more particularly still, during the time Montand was shooting Le Salaire de la peur.11 Signoret was under no illusion as to why she had been offered the part; Clouzot did not especially rate her talents, even though she was by this time an internationally recognised star. He thought that Casque d’or (undoubtedly her best performance to date) was a ‘non-film’.12 However, he also knew that Vera was not an actor, and so he wanted someone who was a friend to work with her.13 Signoret is very clear in her autobiography that it was Vera who wanted the big role, in the meantime pretending that her husband was forcing her into it. Nor was she easy to work with. Signoret’s description of her is generous but makes it clear that she was a woman of extremes.14 So, between Clouzot’s caustic nature and his wife’s difficult ways, she was caught between a rock and a hard place. Small wonder that relations soured and that, towards the end of the shooting, the three of them were no longer speaking to each other15 – a situation not improved upon by the fact that Signoret had agreed to an eight-week contract, but in the end shooting took 16 weeks. Clouzot had covered himself well and Signoret had failed to read the small print, so she was obliged to stay on. Moreover, when it came to pay day, she was paid only for the eight weeks she had signed up to.16 As she rightly points out, it was a mistake to work en famille. Everyone knew each other’s (private) faults and this knowledge clouded judgments in the professional arena of the studio.17 Yet the frictions and silences worked to the film’s advantage: Signoret’s annoyance gets internalised, as an inner violence waiting to let loose that is dramatically terrifying. Vera Clouzot’s distance from her former friend in real life plays admirably to her advantage in the later stages of the film, when she becomes more forceful as a character and starts bossing Nicole/Signoret about – indeed, the force of her dislike rings true.\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n17\n\nClouzot used Signoret in a twofold way, then: first, her star cachet to bring in audiences (much as he had used Montand’s singer-star image for Le Salaire de la peur); second, her willingness to help friends (she had previously appeared in a film, Sans laisser d’adresse (Jean-Paul Le Chanois, 1951), to give moral support to Danièle Delorme). Paul Meurisse is far less gracious than Signoret about the way she was exploited: Well, with his wife Vera, who if she was an actor then I am a Chinaman, he must have been wallowing in happiness! But at what a price! How many hours were spent finding clever ways of lighting her face to give it even a suggestion of expressiveness! How much teeth-grinding and muffled dissent on Simone Signoret’s part, who was watching her talent being used to support the total emptiness of her co-star. But even more craftily, they muted the light on her so that her beauty would not squash still further the insignificance of Vera’s face.18\n\nHarsh words, but disinterested ones, and, if we look closely at the lighting, undoubtedly Signoret is held more in half-tones than Vera Clouzot. This same tendency of trying to sacrifice Signoret for the sake of his wife comes through in the actual shooting. Vera Clouzot has 121 solo shots as opposed to Signoret’s 72. Half of Clouzot’s shots of Vera are in close-up or medium close-up (9 CUs and 51 MCUs), three times the number of those reserved for Signoret, who has only 18 (3 CUs and 15 MCUs). We could be excused for thinking that Vera Clouzot is the only star of this film, not the top-billed star Simone Signoret (and, of course, as we know, it was the Clouzots’ wish that she, Vera, should stand out). However, even though she has only half the presence in terms of solo shots as Vera Clouzot, Signoret, through her sheer actorly presence, dominates the film. Meurisse was cast as Michel, and seemed a natural for it, associated as he had become with roles of the icy but distinguished villain, several of which he had played opposite Signoret: Macadam (Blistène, 1946), Impasse des deux anges (Tourneur, 1948). Clouzot had known Meurisse since his early days, back in 1939, when he was starting out his career as a singer-actor (helped along by Edith Piaf, his then lover). He gave up singing and turned to the theatre, which subsequently became his first, very successful, artistic medium. But he also regularly crossed over and made films. Meurisse’s very distinct film acting style came about as a need to demarcate himself from the two big leads of the 1940s: Pierre Fresnay and Louis Jouvet. Meurisse managed to distinguish himself from the sophisticated urbanity and elegance\n\n18\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nof Fresnay and Jouvet’s dry humour by choosing film roles that required an inscrutable cold indifference tinged with biting sarcasm or caustic wit. His role as Michel for Les Diaboliques suited him, therefore, to a tee. With regard to Clouzot’s legendary tyrannical treatment of actors, Meurisse does not disabuse us on the filmmaker’s need to dominate women, nor on the fact that he and Clouzot had some cross moments.19 He does, however, dispel one myth that has held currency about this film – namely the famous bathtub scene. Rumour had it that, in order to give an authentic feel to the shot, Clouzot immersed Meurisse in cold water. Nothing could be further from the truth, Meurisse tells us. It took two days to shoot this scene and Clouzot had contracted Meurisse for only 13 days, so he certainly could not afford to have his male star laid up with pneumonia. Instead, the sequence was shot with Meurisse immersed in hot water and, in between takes, he was bundled into a heated cabin, dried off, dressed in dry clothes and given whiskey hot toddies. In effect, he remained pleasantly drunk during those two days.20 When we recall that Clouzot once said of actors: ‘I can make any beginner act. But what I detest are actors who think’.21 We can begin to see what Signoret was up against – and, indeed, to a lesser degree, Meurisse (because he was around for only two weeks of the shooting). Both these actors exude intelligence – Meurisse a cold calculating one, Signoret one of strength and brilliance. And, in fact, in this film she has to demonstrate cynical intelligence – the plot largely depends on her ability to dupe us, the audience, and for that to happen she has to dupe Christina (a very complex doubleplay). So Clouzot, in the end, was reliant on the very thing he claimed to detest! In relation to stars, Clouzot also said that he had to ‘tame’ their star persona and make their myth work for him.22 In his efforts to make Signoret more tractable he de-sensualised her (partly through the choice of functional clothing for her to wear), and focused on her hard side. He brought out more the scheming bitch Dora of Les Manèges (Allégret, 1950) than the sensuous Marie of Casque d’or, he also endeavoured to make her less ambiguous. Even the haircut – the short-cropped hair – was a way to destabilise her sensuality and erotic power. However, to a degree this backfired, first because the blondness is glamorous and, second, because Signoret liked the new look.23 Despite Clouzot’s attempts to neutralise her, neither Signoret’s natural authority nor her ironic insolence disappears in\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n19\n\nthis film. In a way, these traits are greatly assisted by casting her as a crisp and no-nonsense science teacher. Clouzot claimed to like to ‘fascinate’ his actors, to ‘read’ into them.24 This suggests a double form of narcissism and control. Control is certainly something that operated for his wife, whose training for the role as the hapless Christina in Les Diaboliques seems, in itself, a trifle diabolical. To get her into shape for the task of actor, Clouzot made her work for nine months learning parts from plays she would never act in but which he taped and then used to correct her delivery.25 Interestingly, he had worked in a similar fashion with (his other novice) Montand for Salaire, for whom it clearly did work.26 This is less evident in general terms for Vera Clouzot, whose tone of delivery is pretty monotone and movement very wooden. Although, having said that, it is also true that, because she behaves like a frozen and frightened rabbit caught in the headlights for most of the film, the terror she embodies works quite well against Signoret’s unnerving, icy manner. Finally, the secondary characters and especially the schoolchildren: Clouzot auditioned 300 children for the 35 he took. In among them he chose Jean-Philippe Smet (later to become known as Johnny Halliday), Yves-Marie Morin (Patrick Dewaere’s brother, who plays Moinet) and Georges Poujouly of Jeux interdits fame (Clément, 1951), who plays Soudieu. The schoolmasters included a début part for Michel Serrault and, of course, a role for two stalwarts of Clouzot’s oeuvre, Pierre Larquey as the vaguely dipsomaniac and well-named M. Drain (which literally means ‘drain’) and Noël Roquevert as the retired schoolmaster who, in part, inadvertently undermines the plot hatched by Michel and Nicole. Last but not least, Charles Vanel comes on board yet again, this time in the form of the somewhat decrepit retired Inspector Fichet. The technical team Les Diaboliques went into pre-production in early June 1954.27 Production itself began in mid-July and the shooting was completed by the beginning of November. The film was shot on location and in studio. Clouzot discovered an abandoned chateau in Étang-la-Ville situated just beyond Saint-Cloud and the Bois de Boulogne, on the edge of the Forêt de Marly and en route to the National 12 – a convenient link onto the National 11, which takes\n\n20\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nNicole and Christina to Niort (some 360 kilometres south-west of Paris). Location shooting at Étang-la-Ville took up the first five of the 16-week shooting schedule. The derelict chateau matched perfectly Clouzot’s need for a setting that spoke decay, dirt and decrepitude. The uncared-for building was consonant with the lack of care for the schoolboys, just as much as its decay implied the moral decrepitude of its adult inhabitants. The swimming pool was not only dirty and unused, again suggesting an uncaring, even unhealthy environment for the boys, but was also full of slime (‘Thick as chocolate soup,’ declares the brave Soudieu, who dives into the murky waters in an attempt to recover Nicole’s keys). The sliminess undoubtedly points to the sleaziness of the teaching personnel – Christina excepted, of course. M. Drain is unkempt and sycophantic, M. Raymond looks to be following in his footsteps. Michel oozes nastiness and Nicole – if not exactly slimy – is far from inspiring trust. With regard to the two other locations (requiring two weeks’ shooting), Clouzot scored a first with the one: the morgue scene is actually shot in a real mortuary.28 As to the other, Clouzot could not resist a little tongue in cheek, to say nothing of auto-referentiality. Nicole’s house is in Niort, Clouzot’s birthplace. Furthermore, the actual house he used for the outside shots was located in Montfort-l’Amaury, directly opposite the house he used for his ‘infamous’ film Le Corbeau (almost as if he were cocking a snoot at the film censors and saying: ‘Look, here I am again!’).29 The interiors were shot in the Saint-Maurice studios south-east of Paris and took an arduous nine weeks. The sets and interiors, with the exception (as we shall see) of Christina’s bedroom, faithfully reproduced traditional boarding school spaces, provincial petit-bourgeois homes and modern Parisian hotels. Camera, sets, lighting and sound are the absolute keys to the look of a Clouzot film. Clouzot’s team of Armand Thirard (1899–1973), Léon Barsacq (1906–1969) and William-Robert Sivel (1908–1982) would work the magic for him on this film. Armand Thirard was Clouzot’s favourite director of photography (he worked on seven of Clouzot’s feature films). Thirard controlled the camera operators and, of course, the lighting. In working on Les Diaboliques he was presented with a more arduous task than usual. In order to speed up the already delayed shooting, Clouzot had two camera teams at work – both of whom had to be supervised by Thirard.30 This explains why, when we read the credits, the names of three camera operators (rather than one) roll by, after Armand Thirard’s, of course. This detailed\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n21\n\nnaming was quite unusual as a general practice (at the time), but it points to the heaviness of the production practices and, as we know, Clouzot’s target of 48 days’ shooting was in the end doubled, despite having two teams. But, in all this, what is so remarkable is the great continuity in this film (in terms of lighting alone), achieved by the careful coordination put in place by Thirard. Equally remarkable is the seamless shift between location and studio lighting. Thirard was ‘a master of monochrome and colour, his interiors gave off a refulgence reminiscent almost of old Master paintings’.31 As a master of monochrome, as this quote makes clear, he was obviously very aware of how to exploit source lighting, and this brings us back to Paul Meurisse’s comment on the way Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret were lit. In all the interior scenes, invariably, Vera Clouzot is fully lit, even highlighted, suggesting the use of considerable front lighting (as well as fill lights) because she looks quite white and is without any shadows on her face. On the contrary, Signoret is consistently held in neutral, even grey tones of light. Even the sequence when they are driving to Niort, where you might expect shifting light on the faces, produces no change. In fact, this scene was studio shot with backprojection. Once again it was possible to control light so that Vera Clouzot was in full light and Signoret in a grey shaded area. On the few occasions that there is sidelighting on Signoret’s face, it is simply a case of levels of greyness and not of a contrastive black and white (as in an expressionist chiaroscuro shot, for example). Apart from the reasons for this practice supplied by Meurisse, that Clouzot was attempting to keep Signoret in the shadow of his wife, what this also does is to queer the picture for us as spectators. Let us assume we do not have the insider knowledge; how are we able to read this lighting of our two female protagonists – the bleachedwhite Christina and the grey Nicole? First of all, the lack of any true contrastive lighting on Signoret takes away from her potential role as a femme fatale. In her greyness, she hardly makes the mark, does she? Second, her grey is placed against Vera Clouzot’s white, so here again she fails, this time to act as the negative (i.e. black) foil to Christina’s supposed ‘innocent, virginal’ being. There is no positive and negative. Monochrome has been stripped of one of its salient features: its blackness. And this is where the twist comes in. Grey areas suggest a lack of clarity, as opposed to black – which, in the context of noir films, usually means bad, or the dark side of the self. The lighting on Signoret, then, signals to us that she is not what she seems; what it also tells\n\n22\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nus is that she is not a split persona (as the use of contrastive lighting on her à la film noir would have indicated to us). So, she remains more of a mystery to us than she would have done had she been constructed, through contrastive lighting, as a femme fatale or as a true villain. Nicole’s interaction with the pupils in the science laboratory is another indication of her complex persona: here we see her ruffling Moinet’s hair, showing at the very least a fondness for the young pupil (see picture on p. 23). Thus, Clouzot’s attempts to shadow Signoret out into grey have had the opposite effect from the one he was trying to achieve; we are far more intrigued by this woman in grey than the woman in white. An interest Signoret keeps alive by the fluidity of her body as performance, as opposed to Vera Clouzot’s stiff and wooden delivery. Signoret is a shadow that has made herself flesh. But I want also to pause for a second on this question of monochrome versus colour in relation to Clouzot’s film. By the mid-1950s colour and cinemascope were readily available, albeit expensive, formats. The cinemascope wide-screen process brought with it the magnetic soundtrack. As opposed to the optical mono soundtrack, the magnetic track provided high-fidelity sound and larger volume range as well as stereo-sound (sevenand four-track stereo was available). But its merits could be heard only on the new wide-screen format, thanks to the new quality projectors and sound system. However, exhibition practices at the time, for the most part, forestalled its use. Thus, very few theatres were equipped to run the new format given the expense of conversion. The advantages of magnetic sound were, however, felt at the post-production stage even for standard-format films, in that it was an easier system for mixing sound than the optical sound system and so helped to cut production costs.32 Clouzot had hoped to shoot Les Diaboliques in cinemascope, while still keeping to black and white film.33 This would have allowed him to profit fully from the merits of magnetic sound and to have made his film, sonorically speaking, even more terrifying. It was not the cost of cinemascope that held him back, however, but the effect on the image of projecting black and white cinemascope: I think it is very difficult to shoot a black and white film in cinemascope or vistavision because they are projected onto metallised screens which don’t work with black and white. And I wasn’t satisfied with the trials I had run with Technicolor. I don’t want to shoot with so-called natural colours. I want to be able to work with colours that have been rendered.34\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n23\n\nInterestingly, the debate around magnetic sound in the early 1950s was similar to that about colour. Both were seen as unrealistic. Until the mid- to late 1950s colour was still identified with films of fantasy and costume drama (not until the advent of colour television would it be deemed realistic). And because stereo sound did not ‘speak from the screen’ it was perceived as unrealistic in its spectacular effects. The effect of not using cinemascope meant, then, that at the time of Les Diaboliques’ release its sound and standard format would, ultimately, vie in favour of realism for its audiences (black and white film with central optical sound being deemed more realistic). Spectators could have fear with conviction! And what is so fantastic about Clouzot’s film is that – although it is, of course, a mono optical soundtrack – somehow, because of its density, it sounds almost as if it is in stereo. Using the Artec sound system he had to hand, his sound engineer, William-Robert Sivel, managed to make the soundtrack so loud at times that we feel our own ears hurting. This is especially true of the various sounds at the end of the film (the high-pitched squeaking doors, the thunderous clacking of the typewriter keyboard), which effectively send Christina tailspinning into a heart attack. The very opening credit sequence of the film – with the angelic voices of the\n\nNicole uncharacteristically showing fondness – ruffling Moinet’s hair\n\n24\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nboys’ choir intoned over the credits contrasting heavily with the loud demonic music they are chanting – warns us that we are in for a painful and frightening experience.35 Sivel was a brilliant sound technician. He worked, in his lifetime, on over 300 films – nine of which were with Clouzot. And part of what made the soundtrack so special in its depth and resonance in Les Diaboliques was Sivel’s ability to highlight the specific sounds Clouzot wanted to accentuate, through maintaining a virtual silence around them. Thus, we feel the terror entering Christina’s heart as she hears the footsteps of her husband approaching the house in Niort. We listen to the tap dripping relentlessly on the nylon tablecloth as Christina, racked by guilt, is unable to sleep. We are warned early on in the film how much of a role the soundtrack has to play when we hear first the roar of the engine and then the wheels of the camionnette crushing the paper sailing boat left in a puddle. Every detail of the crunched paper and splash through the water is heard. The soundtrack, in other words, is as harsh and pitiless as the rest of the film. The realism of the soundtrack depends, of course, on its ability to resonate properly within the decor. And the sets offered by Léon Barsacq admirably complement the sound; both gel into a sense of the real. It is surely no coincidence that Barsacq is credited as the ‘architecte-décorateur’ in this film – for his sets are those of an architect. He was a leading art director of his time, part of the wave of Russian émigrés who came to Paris during the 1920s. In Paris he trained in architecture and the decorative arts, much like Lazare Meerson before him (the poetic realist art director). He was assistant art director to Andrei Andrejew (a favourite of Clouzot’s) and he worked with Alexander Trauner on Carné’s Les Enfants du paradis (1944). Although trained up by some of the exemplary poetic realist set designers, Barsacq believed, like Meerson, that ‘design should subordinate itself to the narrative, simply lending atmospheric support’.36 Unlike the hyper-realist tendencies associated with poetic realist decor, therefore, Barsacq favoured a less complex design. He achieved a ‘delicate balance between realism and artifice’37 – something we can observe with his school interiors in Les Diaboliques, for example. The classrooms, refectory and dormitory are all completely consonant with boarding school spaces of that time (audiences would recognise and know them). However, the private quarters of the school tell a different story and contrast quite shockingly with the sparseness of the rest of the school. The\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n25\n\nGothic richness of Christina’s bedroom says more about her Latin American origins, her own inner psyche and devout Catholicism than it does about a mid-20-century boarding school headmistress’s private quarters. It is actually quite intriguing that Michel should even agree to sleep in such a space, with its Catholicism oozing off the walls in the form of Christian icons and candles, to say nothing of the wooden palings carving up the space, making it more suggestive of a confessional box than a place of rest. While he certainly appears to rule the roost with an iron fist everywhere else in this nightmarish school, Michel has, to all intents and purposes, yielded to his wife’s devoutly eccentric taste in the private sphere most readily associated with intimacy. Dare one suggest that the space smacks of femininity? As we shall see in the next chapter, Michel does not unambiguously or entirely occupy a masculine space. Indeed, much works within the narrative to place him in a more feminised one. This may help explain why, after everyone has left, he decides to rape his wife in the refectory rather than the bedroom. In any event, the oppressive decor of the bedroom suggests he is not as allpowerful as he at first might appear. And it is worth remembering that the only time he is in there is when he lies fast asleep in bed, fully dressed as if he had passed out in a drunken stupor, or (metaphorically) suffocated under the weight of the decor. According to Barsacq,38 getting the atmosphere right is what counts. He looks to find the atmosphere of each film and bring out the specific style that suits the period. To his mind, sets offer a précis of reality, not reality itself. This notion of précis suggests a lightness of touch, and indeed Barsacq’s set designs were often produced in a sketch-like style which we associate with architectural design yet which, once put in place, have (as do real buildings) a material quality of the real – a quality helped, it has to be said, by the fact that Barsacq would always indicate the lighting effects. Barsacq’s training in architecture is evident, then, in the dynamic composition of his sets, and we feel them breathing – although not necessarily fresh air, as we have noted in particular with Christina’s stifling bedroom! In a very similar way, objects in the film, particularly those that are held in extreme close-up, have an inherent power themselves, and it is instructive to note that the extreme close-up is not used at all until the terrorising of Christina in the last section of the film – at which point objects seem to come alive. Thing-power is something we associate with Hitchcock very\n\n26\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nreadily.39 Yet Clouzot is at least his equal. The first object that seems to take on a life of its own is the wicker trunk. When Nicole lets it go down the steps of the garage attic, it hurtles down the stairwell and almost takes Christina with it. Later, in Niort, it almost causes Christina to faint as she drags it across the hallway. At this point it is empty and we know that Nicole has had no problems moving it around, so its bulk works against Christina’s fragility. Once the two women have bundled Michel’s body into it and are trying, with M. Herboux’ help, to get it into the camionnette, the trunk bursts a catch, exposing the plastic tablecloth inside, much like an overweight body bursting a button off and revealing the flesh beneath.40 The trunk again threatens to expose the truth when the two women make a stop for petrol, and the pump attendant, having dragged the drunken soldier out of the back of their camionnette, notices a puddle of water. He assumes it is the soldier who has ‘had an accident’ and offers to wipe it up. Nicole, afraid that the secret will seep out, hurriedly slams the doors shut and takes off. Still the trunk has not finished having power. Right towards the end of the film Inspector Fichet discovers the trunk, which has now been returned to its original place, up in the garage attic, but which has tenaciously held onto a vital piece of evidence, namely the (still wet) plastic tablecloth. This secret is out. Objects combine to stress Christina’s ailing heart. The smallest of objects can have an effect. They have thing-power, which the use of sound and close-ups merely serves to intensify. Bathroom taps drip; plastic table-cloths hiss; clasps snap; Moinet’s catapult moves about in mysterious ways, as does Michel’s Prince of Wales suit; photographs reveal missing (presumed dead) husbands in the background; typewriters type away on their own; paper names names; and so on. Objects have almost corporeal substance. Conversely, human bodies (and hands) become unsubstantial shadows (especially Michel’s). Objects make noise and have the ability to disappear and reappear with a randomness we more readily associate with human beings (in general, people move about, unlike inanimate objects, which do not move or generate sound unassisted). It is objects, rather than people, that make the unbelievable take on a life and become real, diabolical even. We are manipulated by them and their behaviour into suspending our disbelief, colluding with the terror they spawn.\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n27\n\nConclusion Clouzot’s love of the right detail goes across the whole spectrum of production. This obsession with the detail of the real – which he achieves through his intense pre-production planning and his ability to capitalise on the skills of his technicians – means that he creates a materially realist film that breathes its meaning. Terrifying sounds thunder from the centre of the screen and cause us to shy away, fearing the worst for our own hearts. The stifling decor of Christina’s bedroom in which she finds herself entombed, the shocking whiteness of the bathroom that will never wash her clean of her ‘crime’ and in which she will perish – all this detail works to weave the sense of suffocating horror in which even we can no longer breathe.\n\nNotes 1 2 3 4 5\n\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n13 14 15 16\n\nEdinburgh Film Festival Catalogue 57, 2003, p. 123.

Two women (a wife and mistress) plot to murder (through drowning) a detestable man who tyrannises them both. All appears to go to plan. The man is murdered and tossed into a filthy swimming pool. So far so good. But the next day the body cannot be found. The pool is emptied and, to the wife’s horror, the dead man has disappeared. The shock almost kills her. But she recovers, only to be further assailed by evidence that her dead husband must still be alive. His suit turns up from the drycleaners. When she and the mistress go to question the owner of the drycleaning business, she helps their investigation move forward by supplying a hotel key left behind in the suit pocket. The husband, it appears, has rented himself a little pied-à-terre in the fashionable 17th arrondissement of Paris. When the two women turn up at his hotel, however, he remains as invisible as ever.1 Things look to be resolved when a newspaper article announces that a naked body has been found in the river Seine. The wife sets off to the morgue to identify her husband successfully (she hopes). To no avail: it is not him. More shocks to her system. By now the original desire to get rid of her husband is turning into a nightmarish attempt to find his body. To top it all, a retired police inspector has pushily joined in, uninvited,\n\n30\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nto help investigate the disappearance. The wife, increasingly riddled by remorse and fear, banishes the mistress. The inspector gradually works out what has happened, but too late to save the wife, as it transpires. She dies, diabolically driven to her death by the – at first – ghostly and – subsequently – all too real evidence (as in the body returns alive) that her husband is not dead after all. Structurally, Les Diaboliques can be neatly divided into four parts – as the following diagram makes clear:\n\nDiagram 1 – Plot structure Part One\n\nPart Two\n\nPart Three\n\nPart Four\n\nSetting the scene:\n\nLeaving for Niort;\n\nThe body\n\nChristina goes to\n\nthe school; the\n\n‘murder’; return to\n\ndisappears; Nicole\n\nthe morgue;\n\ntriangular\n\nschool; dumping\n\nand Christina\n\nInspector Fichet\n\nrelationship Michel/\n\nbody in swimming\n\ninvestigate; things\n\ncomes along and\n\nChristina/Nicole\n\npool; things go\n\nare not going\n\ninvestigates; the\n\naccording ‘to plan’\n\naccording ‘to plan’\n\nreal plan/plot is uncovered\n\nMichel is in charge\n\nNicole is in charge\n\nFirst Nicole, then\n\nInspector Fichet is\n\nChristina is in charge in charge Duration: 16m47s\n\nDuration: 38m\n\nDuration: 21m\n\nDuration: 37m51s\n\nIn terms of who appears to be in control, as we can see, the two women, between them, are in charge during the central part (parts two and three) of the narrative for a duration of 59 minutes. However, the plot is structured in such a way that men – either Michel or Inspector Fichet – bookend the narrative and are in control for a duration of 54 minutes and 38 seconds. With hindsight, however, Michel’s control is very quickly brought into question by the occurrences in part two. Thus, he is less the master of the moment than he appeared to be at first. His power is seemingly diminished quite quickly within the narrative – undermined, in fact, by the women (and their plot to kill him). Indeed, of the men, it is only Fichet who has the ability to restore law and order, not Michel – who, as it transpires, is solely\n\nP L O T, C A M E R A , C H A R A C T E R I S AT I O N\n\n31\n\nan agent of disruption. It is, after all, his greed for Christina’s money and his lust for Nicole that drive him to commit the crime of terrorising his wife to death. The central part of the film is interesting, however, for a number of structural reasons. For a start, it is rare in French film noir for women to have such a dominant role – especially one that is virtually equal in length to that of the men. Notably, however, their power, as we shall learn in the end, is all associated with illusion. The female dominance, then, is undermined by the outcome. For, as we discover, once Fichet starts to investigate and uncover the truth, the women have in fact committed a non-murder and are, as a result, investigating a non-mystery (since there is no missing body, only a missing, alive Michel). In a sense, they are expending fruitless energy; their quest has no purpose. Thus, their control is as spurious and as much of a simulacrum as Michel’s appeared to be in part one. Everyone, with the exception of Fichet, is playing to false situations of control – some with knowledge (Nicole and Michel), some without (Christina). Furthermore, the issue of Michel’s agency in part one comes full circle again. As we find out at the end, he was playing dumb to the situation in part one (pretending not to know that the two women were plotting, even though he knew exactly what was happening). So he did, in the end, have some form of control then. However, his problem is that, while he might be smart enough (with Nicole’s help) to outwit Christina, he is not cunning enough to outfox the older crusty patriarch. Christina dies only half understanding the truth: that her husband is not dead despite the fact that she had killed him. Nothing leads us to believe that she has worked out that it was a dastardly plot concocted by Nicole and Michel to bring about her death. Given her Catholicism and belief in the supernatural, a return from the dead could just be possible. Even if that is too farfetched, nonetheless, her conscience works to her downfall. Christina’s traumatic dream at the end of the film, from which she awakens to find Fichet (the embodiment of the law) looming over her, serves only to confirm her realisation that she is condemned for the rest of her life to bear witness to the murder. Her last moments alive are invested in confirming her guilt. She has to trace the source of the footsteps she hears and the shadow she has seen. By finding the ‘live corpse’ she hopes to put an end to the traumatic event of Michel’s dying. However, there is no way out; alive or dead, he will constantly remind her of her criminal deed. To find him alive means she is\n\n32\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\ncondemned to one set of traumatic repetitions, just as surely as she is condemned to another set of traumatic nightmares if he remains dead. The only way of ending it is to end herself, to die. To abrogate power completely. Equally significant in relation to this notion of the undermining of female power is the fact that, even during the period when the two women are in charge, the male still manages to intrude and risk exposing their crime. When in Niort to carry out the murder, the retired schoolteacher notes down the time of both the running of the bathwater and its draining away (a vital set of clues that, when the two schemers are brought to court, will surely serve to uncover their plot); then, of course, there is his clumsy handling of the trunk (already mentioned) and the drunken soldier who climbs into the back of the camionnette. Small wonder that Nicole is so sharp and rude to them all and just about keeps them at bay. But the female control is precarious at best, and the last male to intrude, Inspector Fichet, is the one who successfully manages to get under the net (or the plastic tablecloth) of what is, after all, an illusion and expose it for what it is: a contemptible hoax. Curiously, in the original novel, female dominance is not undermined. Lucienne remains the dominant figure throughout the narrative and the husband, Ravinel, a weak exploitable creature. The entire scheme in the novel, to defraud the insurance company, is hers. Ravinel (unaware that it is his life that is in danger and believing it is his wife’s life insurance they will get) follows meekly along with the plan. In fact, he still feels considerable fondness for his wife, Mireille, so the scheme to murder her purely for the money seems less convincing than the murder plot in the film. A first shift in meaning occurs then. In the film we are not in the know as to the real plot; we do not realise that greed is at the bottom of it all. Thus, we take at face value that Nicole and Christina are not motivated by gain in their plot to kill Michel. Indeed, this absence of pecuniary motive makes their desire to be rid of him both plausible and seemingly rational. At first we might experience some sympathy for them, because Michel is so cruel. Not so the characters in the novel; they are all quite unappetising from the start. As to the question of female dominance, the retired inspector, Inspector Merlin, who offers to help Ravinel trace his wife does not have the persistence of his filmic recreation, Inspector Fichet. Indeed, he rather summarily dismisses Ravinel’s evidence as hallucinations and leaves him to it. Thus, the women outwit the men. Not only that, their lesbian relationship is the one that is\n\nP L O T, C A M E R A , C H A R A C T E R I S AT I O N\n\n33\n\nallowed to survive: the women get their hands on the money and take off to Antibes. Their crime does pay, but only because Ravinel, a pitiful male, embodies a type of masculinity that was so much in evidence at that time, both in noir literature and noir realist films – namely, a masculinity in crisis (which even the institutional voice of the law rejects, in the person of Inspector Merlin!). For Nicole and Michel, however, crime does not pay. And there are a number of reasons for this. The reversal of the narrative by Clouzot causes several interesting things to occur. Michel, for a start, occupies a far more complex situation than Ravinel. Essentially, as the ostensible murder victim, he gets to occupy the narrative position formerly assigned to Mireille. Yet he is also an extremely virile male, prone to aggressive and domineering ways. And money drives his desire to get rid of Christina. In all these ways, he takes on Lucienne’s behavioural traits. The traits he most assuredly does not espouse are those of Ravinel, the original husband. In other words, on two counts he is associated with the two female personas of the novel: the strong, masculine Lucienne and the weak, feminine Mireille. As I shall argue later (in Chapter 3), Michel occupies in part the position of the femme fatale, but we can already see here how that is the case. He is both cruel and manipulative (like Lucienne); later, he is reduced to a floppy feminised weakness by the spiked whisky he drinks and, once he disappears, becomes the object of investigation (as Mireille does in the novel, and like all femme fatales in film noir). Nicole also occupies in part the role of the femme fatale – though not, as we shall see, with as much conviction as Michel. But this overlapping queers the narrative pitch, so to speak – the trope or stereotype of the femme fatale becomes too fragmented. Who is the femme fatale here? Answering this question is not helped by the fact that Nicole, like Michel, has many traits in common with Lucienne: she has a murky past, her face is hard and implacable, she is ruthless and manipulative.2 But here similarities draw to a halt. Nicole’s femme fataleness slips into a rather parochial petite bourgeoisie. Whereas Lucienne and Michel are obsessed with money, Nicole is obsessively mean. She gives full display to this when she is in Niort: she insists on turning out the lights once the shutters are open so as not to be wasteful; she complains about the price of the whisky she buys to put the sleeping draught in; she is furious at the cost of the plastic tablecloth bought to shroud Michel in once he is drowned; she\n\n34\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nis so mean she has not replaced the ageing bathpipes in her house. It is her meanness more than her cold, manipulative ways that gives her away in the end. No glamorously devious and slinky femme fatale behaviour here, then – merely sordid meanness. Because she is such a cheapskate, the plastic tablecloth is of poor quality, and tears. Water leaks out in the camionnette and is discovered later by Inspector Fichet in the wicker trunk hidden back up in the garage attic; as a result of this discovery he works out how the murder was carried out. Throughout the novel it is as if Lucienne and Ravinel are working against each other. Lucienne stays as far away as possible from the crime scene – she works in Nantes and Ravinel lives just outside Paris – and she expects Ravinel to do all the dirty work. She is merely the brains behind the crime and, as such, she is almost as much of a ghost as Mireille. Once the murder has happened Ravinel for his part becomes consumed by guilt and terrified by the hauntings of his wife, whom he now realises he really quite loved. Lucienne dominates from afar, but such is her power, that both Ravinel and Mireille commit the act of murder for her – Mireille to end her boring existence with Ravinel, Ravinel because he has allowed himself to be manipulated by Lucienne into believing this is what he wants. Yet, unlike Michel, he neither hates nor abuses his wife. He collapses and dies in a state of penitence – longing for his old life back. The point of the novel is to reveal the impotence of men in the face of scheming and independent women who no longer need them. A new kind of criminality, that of the lesbian predator, is portrayed as something unfamiliar, uncanny and which threatens, but against which there is little defence since it is so ‘unknowable’. And because it is unknowable, this time, crime pays. In the end it could be argued that the novel points more truthfully to the unease felt around female sexuality in the 1950s – its uncontainability after the war – than does the film. This is not to claim, however, that Clouzot was reticent around taboo subjects. As Judith Mayne makes clear,3 he has consistently foregrounded questions of sexuality and gender in his films. For example, in his earlier film, Quai des Orfèvres, he introduced the lesbian figure of Dora who did not figure in the original novel. She is a sympathetic character who is not in any way judged for her sexual preferences and who ends up commanding the respect of the police inspector. And, indeed, even if, in Les Diaboliques, Clouzot felt the need to straighten out the story for his wife Vera’s sake, nonetheless\n\nP L O T, C A M E R A , C H A R A C T E R I S AT I O N\n\n35\n\nthe queer – as we shall see – still creeps in. Arguably for Clouzot, on the face of things, the primary focus this time was on the complexity of making the thriller work differently through a creative play with the signs rather than an overt discourse on questions of sexuality. Thus, suspense comes to the fore and sexuality moves to the backburner. There is no need for plot line to carry a great burden of representation since the purpose of the film is to make a spine-chilling thriller. The film, then, is not about masculinity in crisis, although it does, almost despite itself, reveal the unfixity of gender. By heterosexualising the story, Clouzot makes the plot one of the oldest in the book: getting rid of the wife so the mistress and husband can make off with the money. And this is why their crime does not pay: the imperative of film noir logic dictates that they must get found out. How long Clouzot can keep us from finding out is the trick of the film and its source of suspense. Nicole and Michel, as we learn by the end of the film, have worked together fantastically as a team, like clockwork. Both Nicole and Michel are the metteurs-en-scène of the plot to ‘kill off ’ Christina, and so they equal each other in their cruelty. This is not the case for the original couple: it is Lucienne alone who is hard as nails (exemplified by the fact that she is constantly filing her fingernails with vigour). Ravinel is soft and weak, certainly not cruel. Nicole and Michel also equal each other in their incredible meanness. Michel’s stinginess, as exemplified in the revolting food he provides for the pupils, is completely unforgivable – as indeed Christina at one point tells him. Nicole’s pennypinching – while it might find some external rationale in the effects of the post-war mentality of never wasting anything – nonetheless is deeply unattractive. They remain two sides of a gendered coin therefore – unlike Lucienne and Ravinel, who in terms of gender stereotypes switch over roles (she is masculine, he emasculated and quite feminine). But (as we shall also see) Michel and Nicole constitute two sides of the femme fatale coin – arguably to the extent that their power cancels each other out. As such, neither of them occupies the space of masculinity in crisis in the way that Ravinel does. But they do foreground a complex set of questions around gender and sexuality that surprisingly, the original novel given its lesbian intertext, merely touches upon.\n\n36\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nCamerawork Shot distribution reveals how Clouzot constructs his tight thriller. Shot predominantly in medium shot and close-up, the effect is a claustrophobic atmosphere. Reinforcing this sense of stifling anxiety is the increased density of shots per minute. At 6.5 shots per minute, the shooting speed in this film is faster than the average for a French film (the average, at the time, varying between 4.4 and 5.5 per minute).4 The percentages of shots are as follows:\n\nDiagram 2 – Percentage of shots Long shots\n\nMedium shots\n\nMedium close-ups\n\nClose-ups\n\nExtreme close-ups\n\n4%\n\n27%\n\n39%\n\n29%\n\n1%\n\n(mcu, cu, ecus = 69%)\n\nNote the intensity of close-up shooting – well over half of the film (69%). And if we look at the distribution of the shots over the four parts, then further intriguing data emerges:\n\nP L O T, C A M E R A , C H A R A C T E R I S AT I O N\n\n37\n\nWe can observe how parts one and three follow a similar graphic movement in terms of peaking at around the 45 mark, flattening off and then falling; whereas parts two and four peak much higher, around the 75 mark, and then fall off. This suggests greater levels of intensity and, indeed, claustrophobia in parts two and four, created by the significant rise in MCUs and CUs. And, if we consider the patterns overall, then what emerges is that parts one and three, in their less extreme shape, act as foils to parts two and four, respectively. In other words, they build up the momentum, setting the scene for the other two, more explosive parts. Thus, parts one and three are where Clouzot cranks up, begins to wind up the mechanism that will be let loose in all its ferocity in the murder sequence (in part two) and the terrorising of Christina (in part four). The most balanced shape is in part one, as one would expect, since it establishes the various relationships. The three other parts are similar in that the MCUs or CUs outnumber the MSs. This intensification in tight framing matches the thriller nature of the film. So all these shapes make considerable sense. However, what is intriguing is that the fastest paced of all four parts is part one, at 7.4 shots per minute. The three other parts are quite even in nature: 6.2, 6.5 and 6.2, respectively. Thus, a series of questions immediately arise. Why the fast early pace of part one? Why the even pacing in the rest? Why intensify the shots and not the pace at the same time? And here it is that I believe we come to Clouzot’s love of tensions and paradoxes. We know he pre-planned his films meticulously, so there is nothing arbitrary in the above rhythms we have noted. A first obvious reason for the fast pacing of part one comes down to the number of characters Clouzot has to introduce. But, if we recall that six different locations or sets get used here, then we can understand more about this pacing. Two sequences in this first part are exteriors, the other three are interiors. In them we get a feel for the topography of the different, individual spaces: the school playground, the swimming pool, the corridors, science lab, refectory and Christina’s bedroom. But we do not yet know fully how they all link up. In other words, the mapping or geography of the space is not yet completely clear. The fast pacing then muddles us a little with regard to the real space we are looking at. And this will become significant only in the last sequence of the film (when Christina dies). The speed, then, of this first part works to introduce both characters and space but it also serves to\n\n38\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nreveal less than more – speed as a sleight of hand (or camera) is what is at work here. As to the even pacing of the other three parts of his film, here Clouzot creates the feeling that something inexorable is about to happen. It is like a hanging sense of doom – the longer it gets drawn out the more eventempoed it is and the more threatening it feels. The shots provide a sense of cranking up the intensity of pain while the pacing evokes a progressive, measured suffocation. Even the panning and tracking shots, of which there are many, fail to bring any air into this stifling and cruel atmosphere. Given that there is, on average, one tracking shot per minute and one pan every two, we could hope to feel less fixed. But such is not the case. All the tracking shots are quite short, some even remarkably so. At times the tracking shot gets interrupted, stopped in its tracks, as it were, before being able to pick up again. At other times this stop-start feel becomes almost a rocking back and forward, with a backtracking being almost immediately followed by a forward-tracking. This is particularly the case in the murder scene in Nicole’s apartment, especially if we measure from the moment Michel arrives until he is drowned. A quarter of the shots in that sequence are in tracking (21 out of 84 shots). There are ten forward- and 11 backtracking shots. A sense of buffeting occurs (reminding us of Clouzot’s boxing analogy once more), and we are quite right to feel somewhat unstable. This feeling is compounded by the fact that, taking the film as a whole, there are twice as many backtracking shots as forward ones (71 to 37), to say nothing of the fact that most of them are in either MS or MCU. We can easily feel ourselves falling back into some unidentified hole since we have no idea what is behind us. A diabolical vertigo if ever there was one! Characterisation In terms of characterisation, there are numerous reflections and refractions between individuals and groups of individuals. Thus, almost in hierarchical fashion, the initial triangle between Michel, Nicole and Christina is reflected by the second-order characters M. Drain, M. Raymond and Plantiveau, and subsequently by M. and Mme Herboux. To explain: Drain and Raymond are immediate foils for Michel and Nicole. The hypocrisy, snideness, lack of compassion for the schoolboys and general nastiness of the adulterous couple\n\nP L O T, C A M E R A , C H A R A C T E R I S AT I O N\n\n39\n\n(Michel and Nicole) finds an easy echo in Drain and Raymond’s own behaviour. M. Raymond and M. Herboux’ know-it-all behaviour is a mirroring of Nicole’s own need to assert her knowledge (on a couple of occasions she asserts the superiority of her knowledge over Drain and Raymond). Christina, for her part, finds a ready mirroring in Plantiveau, the man who is kind and concerned when it comes to the well-being of the schoolboys. He too is worried about the poor quality of their nutrition, but is as ineffectual as Christina in getting Michel to change his mean ways. M. and Mme Herboux, living upstairs in the Niort house, are mirror images of the strange couple – Nicole and Christina – below. M. Herboux, like Nicole, is bossy and domineering; he insists that he knows best, reacts angrily when thwarted, is crisp and sharp in both his speech and movements, and unceremoniously expects to have his way all the time (as, for example, when he bangs his shoe on the floor), in the same way that Nicole brusquely commandeers her pupils out of their classroom, tosses the rubber at Christina, and so on. Mme Herboux, like Christina, so clearly lives in her husband’s shadow. As if to make this point all the clearer there is a moment, as she opens the door to Nicole, when all we see is her shadow projected onto the wall opposite the door. Mme Herboux is weak and subservient and one cannot imagine her standing up to her tyrannical husband any more than we can Christina to hers – or, indeed, to Nicole. The children play an interesting role in the film. They are certainly not represented as some ideal of innocence, as opposed to the Manichean ways of their elders. But their naturalness is contrasted with the more extreme behaviour of the grown-ups. The boys exude normalcy: they joke about sex, they cannot wait to achieve puberty and so start shaving early, they tell half-truths, perhaps even lies, they misbehave in the refectory because the food is so awful. Yet, despite the meanness of the school director, they remain exuberant, willing to please, wanting to shine in front of their favourite teacher (Christina, of course). So, as such, they act as a third-order foil to the first and second triangular relationships. They do not, however, mirror their elders but refract against their image, showing how limited and distorted it is and how venal and pusillanimous their elders are. The ending, when Moinet asserts that he has seen Christina (although everyone knows she is dead), acts as a kind of coda on the film. The last word is with the schoolboy, and can be read in several ways. First, that, because of the corrupting ways of\n\n40\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\ntheir elders, he has learned to lie so well he cannot distinguish between truth and fiction. Second, it answers back to the opening score of the film when the angelic voices of the schoolboys intone a sinister and diabolical chant, suggesting that education is more monstrous than it is enlightening (a reading supported by the terrible system of rote-learning we hear being chanted out, from time to time, by the pupils). Finally, and most sadly, Moinet is experiencing the first stages of grief (denial), which none of his elders can recognise; unable to recognise emotions for what they are, they decide he must be punished. There is something quite gruesomely cruel in sending the youngster to the corner of a now completely abandoned and doubly derelict school – not just physically derelict but morally so, thanks to the teachers’ dereliction of their pastoral and pedagogical duties.\n\nNotes 1 2 3 4\n\nMuch of this plot (of being absent but apparently living) is played out in a not dissimilar fashion in Hitchcock’s 1959 North by Northwest. See Boileau, Pierre and Narcejac, Thomas (1952), pp. 36, 52, 54, 57 and 63 for descriptions of Lucienne that equally match Nicole. Mayne (2000), p. 60. Les Diaboliques has 737 shots over 114 minutes.\n\n3\n\nTexts and intertexts: what kind of film is this – noir, queer, political?\n\nLes Diaboliques is something of an unsettled text. In the previous chapter I suggested various reasons linked to the nature of the adaptation, and this chapter will further explore this unsettledness. But let us first consider its generic pedigree. When released in France it was labelled as a psychological thriller, which of course it is. But it is also more. In fact, it marks a point tournant in the history of the French thriller, in that, arguably, it can be seen as the French film noir to end all French films noirs (of the post-war period, anyway). As such, it represents a climax to the noir tradition in France (which began in the 1930s) and is a film that, in its intelligence and playful duping of the audience, set new boundaries for this generic tradition and gave pause for thought to Hollywood film noir directors (most significantly Hitchcock). This and the next chapter will go on to demonstrate this. But, first, what is particularly important here is to make clear how the French noir is distinct from its American counterpart. This in turn will allow us to see, in our analysis, how much Clouzot’s text adheres to, yet resists, the French model. Historically, and arguably, French noir predates American noir. Films of the French poetic realist tradition of the late 1930s were black pessimistic films and have, with hindsight, been considered as one of the precursors to noir films. And, even though the actual term ‘film noir’ is generally accepted as a post-constructed category1 used to refer to the American thriller and tough gangster films of the 1940s and 1950s, in fact, as Ginette Vincendeau points out, these French late 1930s films were the first to be ‘routinely’ labelled ‘film noir’ by film critics.2\n\n42\n\nLES DIABOLIQUES\n\nAlthough there is some overlap in the visual style, tone and narrative of the American and French noirs, the actual literary sources of the scenarios help point to a first difference. In the main, the major influence for American noir was hard-boiled crime or detective fiction. But the 1940s American noir was also deeply influenced by Ho"
