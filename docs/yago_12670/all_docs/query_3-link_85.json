        "text": "Maddy at Maddy Loves Her Classic Films is hosting the Horrorathon, celebrating horror movies in the light of the forthcoming Halloween, and I have decided to contribute with a review of one intelligent and highly influential film which some view to be one of the precursors to the modern psychological horror/thriller genre.\n\nLes Diaboliques [1955] ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ1/2\n\nüõÄ A true classic in the suspenseful thriller/horror genre, with a twist ‚Äúto die for‚Äù.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot‚Äôs French-language film Les Diaboliques is the film which Alfred Hitchcock was dying to make, but never did. The film is not a strictly horror film, but, rather, a psychological thriller with suspense and horror elements combined. In this story, two women, Christina and Nicole, the wife and the mistress of the oppressing director of a boarding school respectively, decide to kill their man and then dispose of his body. Everything goes according to plan, but does it, really? After the murder, the two women realise that the corpse of their victim is nowhere to be found and the mystery seems to deepen with each passing day.\n\nLes Diaboliques plays out unassumingly for the majority of its time. The plot seems simple: Michel Delassalle is a tyrannical and mean director of a boarding school for boys, and the two women under his direction are fed up with his abuse towards them and the children. Nicole and Christina are friends, and decide to kill Michel to relieve themselves of their oppression. They do so by luring Michel out, sedating him and killing him by drowning him in a bathtub. The suspense throughout the key film moments is high, and the focus is especially on frail Nicole as she is most affected by her husband‚Äôs murder. There are mental breakdowns here to observe, and one mystery after another surfaces, while the detective, who would like to investigate the disappearance of Christina‚Äôs husband, is seemingly getting closer and closer to the real truth. The real realisation or the ‚Äúpayoff‚Äù comes only at the very end of the film. However, that twist is unexpectedly mind-blowing and so cleverly constructed and presented, that the film‚Äôs length and its slow pace are justified. This means that, upon watching, it will be almost necessary to re-watch the film because the audience undoubtedly missed some important clues or expressions when they watched it for the first time.\n\nBased on a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac titled Celle qui n‚Äô√©tait plus (She who was no more), Les Diaboliques is the kind of a film whose plot is filled with hidden agendas and clues, and it is probably for that reason Hitchcock wanted to make the film so badly. In fact, instances of Les Diaboliques are clearly evident in Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs Psycho (1960), especially the run of a female from a male down the road to hide the crime, and the use of the character of a nosy detective who, finally, has right theories about the crime. Nowadays, the film‚Äôs first part reminds of Ridley Scott‚Äôs Thelma and Louise (1991), a film which looked to Les Diaboliques for some inspiration.\n\nThe cast of the film does a great job. Simone Signoret plays a woman with the nerves of steel ‚Äì Nicole Horner, who is contrasted well with the fragile and vulnerable wife of the victim ‚Äì Christina, played by V√©ra Clouzot, the wife of director Henri-Georges Clouzot. Paul Meurisse, as a diabolical husband Michel, is also good, while Charles Vanel, as a private detective Alfred, has a certain eccentricity and cool rationality about him which later gave the push to invent such notable character as Lieutenant Columbo.\n\nLes Diaboliques may start and continue like one‚Äôs ordinary psychological thriller with a murder mystery to solve, but, by the end, it becomes evident that the film is something very original, very thought-provoking and more intelligent than first guessed. Maybe a little dull in its middle part, it is still ground-breaking and entertaining, with its suspenseful atmosphere and an effective, unforgettable twist, necessitating a second viewing."
