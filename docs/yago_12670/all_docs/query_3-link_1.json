Vera married the actor, taking part in the company's South American tour that lasted almost four years. After World War II, Vera settled in Paris.\n\nIn 1947, Lapara had a role in Unter falschem Verdacht (1947) by Henri-Georges Clouzot. Vera met Henri on the set with her then-husband and it was described as \"coup de foudre\", love at first sight. Clouzot hired Vera as the script girl of his next film, Miquette et sa mère (1950). Vera divorced Lapara and married Henri-Georges Clouzot in 1950. She was directed by her husband in her first film, the 1953 thriller Lohn der Angst (1953), in which she appeared alongside Charles Vanel and Yves Montand. In a short film career Clouzot only performed in films directed by Henri-Georges, the most famous of which was undoubtedly the 1955 thriller Die Teuflischen (1955).\n\nVera died suddenly of a heart attack in 1960 just 15 days short of her 47th birthday."
