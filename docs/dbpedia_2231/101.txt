Deborah Jeane Palfrey, the owner of the Washington, D.C.-area escort service who ran her business Pamela Martin and Associates out of Vallejo, Calif., has been called "the D.C. Madam".

Palfrey, otherwise known as "Miz Julia", "faces federal charges of running a prostitution operation in the Washington area from 1993 through August 2006," Reuters reported April 27, 2007.

The February 2007 federal indictment "alleges that Palfrey engaged more than 100 women from 1993 to 2006 'for the purpose of engaging in prostitution activity with male clients, including sexual intercourse and oral sex in exchange for money.' She made more than $2 million running the operation, known as Pamela Martin and Associates, according to the indictment," William Neikirk wrote May 1, 2007, for the Chicago Tribune.

Palfrey, who "has threatened to expose her high-profile client list" [1], says that she is "neither a politician nor a high government official involved in making war or policy. Nor is she a CIA undercover agent," Neikirk wrote. "Instead, she says she merely ran a legal escort service in the nation's capital featuring massages and sexual fantasy."

Palfrey is a native of Charleroi, Washington County, who lives in Vallejo, Calif. [2]
