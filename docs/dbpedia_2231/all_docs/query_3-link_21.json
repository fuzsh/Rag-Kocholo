Â– In the spring of 1795 it was resolved by the citizens of the town of Washington in meeting assembled that a market-house was needed, and Alexander Addison and Dr. Absalom Baird were appointed to procure subscriptions for that purpose and make arrangements for its erection. The commissioners' records for that year show no account of a plat of ground granted to the borough, and yet tradition and later records indicate that the market-house of this date was erected on the northeast corner of the public square. It was nearly finished in August of that year, as the following notice, published in the Western Telegraphe of Aug. 24, 1795, will show:\n\n\"Washington, 5th August, 1795.\n\n\"A Market-House being finished in the town of Washington, the inhabitants of the town and its neighborhood were by public notice requested to meet at the Market-House on Wednesday, the 5th of August, at half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, to consult on what days it would be proper to hold a market for the sale of provisions in this Market-House.\n\n\"A very full meeting accordingly took place this evening, and it was agreed that the following notification should be published in the newspapers: The inhabitants of this town and of its neighborhood have hitherto suffered many inconveniences; the people of the town from the inconstancy and uncertainty of supply of provisions; the people of the country from being obliged to hawk their articles from door to door without the certainty of a demand or sale. Both these inconveniences may now be remedied, if the people of the country will bring in their different articles of provision at fixed periods, and sell them at the Market-house; and if the people of the town will buy only there at those periods. As the propriety of this is manifest, it is expected that both parties will contribute to carry it into effect. It is therefore proposed that hereafter there shall be two Market Days here each week, Wednesday and Saturday, and that provisions be brought to the Market-House as early as possible on the morning of those days and continued till sold or till ten o'clock forenoon.\n\n\"It was also agreed by all present that none of them would, after the first publications of this notice, buy any provisions in this town on the mornings of those Market days in any place but in the market until after ten o'clock forenoon.\n\n\"N. B. Those who have not paid their subscription for building the Market-House are desired to pay them immediately to Alexander Addison or Absalom Baird; otherwise the subscription will be put into the hands of a Justice of the Peace to collect.\"\n\nOn the 1st of September, 1795, the opening of the market-house was advertised as follows in the Telegraphe: \"A market for produce or provisions will be opened at the Market House in the town of Washington, on every Wednesday or Saturday from early dawn till ten o'clock in the forenoon; and by agreement no produce or provisions of any kind shall be purchased in the town within the above periods, except at the market hours only.\"\n\nUpon the incorporation of the borough in 1810 the Council passed additional laws regulating the markets. The growth of the town soon demanded larger accommodations, and on the 20th of February, 1812, a town-meeting was called at the court-house \"to take into consideration the subject of changing the site of the market house,\" and on the 24th of February \"A Citizen\" makes the following inquiry in the Reporter: \"By what authority do the Commissions of this County enter into any agreement for the absolute and permanent disposition of the public ground; By whom was that public square granted? To whom? and for what purpose? . . . The public square whereon the court house and gaol are erected was granted by David Hoge, the original proprietor of the town of Washington, to James Edgar, &c. . . . in trust for the citizens of Washington County for the purpose of erecting a court House and Gaol thereon.\" The subject was brought to the notice of the Council in November, 1813, and the Council authorized the burgess to call a meeting of the citizens on the 8th of November, which was done and its proceedings published in the Reporter, bearing date Nov. 8, 1813, as follows:\n\n\"Notice.\n\n\"At a meeting of the Burgesses and Council of the borough of Washington, on Saturday, the 6th instant, Resolved, That it is expedient for the chief burgess to give public notice, in one or more of the news papers of the borough, to the taxable inhabitants, to meet at the court house on Friday, the 12th instant, at 6 o'clock P.M., to take into consideration the subject of building a new market house in said borough. Now this is to give notice to said inhabitants to meet at said place and time for the above-mentioned purpose.\n\n\"Given under my hand this 8th day of November, 1813.\n\n\"David Morris,\n\n\"Chief Burgess.\"\n\nNo account of the meeting mentioned above is found in the papers of the time. In January, 1815, when the agitation for a bank and location of a site was under discussion, a call was issued for a public meeting as follows:\n\n\"Town-Meeting.\n\n\"At a meeting of the citizens of this borough held at the court house this evening, Dr. David G. Mitchell was called to the chair, and John Barrington, secretary,. The following resolutions were adopted, viz.:\n\n\"Resolved, That it is expedient to change the site of the market house from the north to the south side of the public square for the purpose of erecting a banking house, on the northeast corner of said square and for the better accommodation of the citizens at large, provided, however, that no change or alteration in the present scite of the market house shall take place until the consent of the proper authority shall be first had and obtained to erect a banking house on the northeast corner of the public square and a market house on the southeast corner of said square, nor until arrangements be made and a contract entered into for the building of said banking house on that ground.\n\n\"Resolved, That Alexander Murdoch, Thomas Baird, and James Orr, Esquire, be a committee to procure the necessary authority and grant for said market and banking house, from the legislature and commissioners of the county.\n\n\"David G. Mitchell, Chairman.\n\n\"John Barrington, Secretary.\n\n\"Washington, 7th Jan'y, 1815.\"\n\nThis committee subsequently ascertained that the public square could not be diverted from public purposes, and the idea was abandoned.\n\nOn the 13th of June, 1815, about one hundred and twenty of the taxable inhabitants of the borough met at the court-house to take into consideration the propriety of erecting a new market-house. Hugh Workman was chosen chairman, and Thomas M. T. McKennan secretary. Resolutions were passed to the effect that a large and commodious market-house be erected on the northeast corner of the public square as soon as the consent of the commissioners of the county to enlarge the market-house be obtained. A committee waited on the commissioners and presented their request, and on the 21st of June following the commissioners granted permission to the inhabitants of the borough to erect a market-house on the east and north sides of the public square fifty-three feet, fronting on Main Street, and on a range with the public offices and parallel with Main Street.\n\nAfter this grant from the commissioners it was thought advisable to make the market-house two stories in height, and a request was made of the commissioners for that purpose, which was granted on the 2d of November, with the proviso \"That one room or apartment shall be made thereon of a convenient size for the accommodation of the Burgesses and Council of said Borough.\" The grant provided further that after the expiration of twenty-five years the borough should deliver the market-house to the commissioners of Washington County upon payment of the original cost of the building.\n\nThe building was erected under the supervision of Parker Campbell, Alexander Murdoch, and Thomas McGiffin, who were appointed by the Council a building committee, with authority to borrow money not to exceed two thousand dollars. The contract for its erection was given to Col. James Ruple. It was delivered to the burgess and Council on the 20th of October, 1817. The rooms were rented on the 25th to the following persons: Room No. 1 to Robert Estep; No. 2 to John Purviance; Nos. 3 and 5 to Thomas H. Baird; No. 4 to John McCloney; No. 6 to the Rev. Matthew Brown and James Williamson, who opened a school for young ladies on the 10th of November following. Isaiah Steen also rented one of the rear rooms on the upper floor for a chair-shop. On the 1st of April, 1818, John Grayson took possession of room No. 5, where he published the Washington Examiner till April 28, 1827. Andrew Gwinn taught school in room No. 2 above the market in July, 1822. Obadiah Jennings taught school for some time in the building, commencing in May, 1824. Philip Potter taught there in 1824-25, and Henry Williams in 1836. Others also taught in the old buildings whose names are not ascertained. A veranda was built on the second floor on Main and Beau Streets. The one on Main Street was the favorite resort of the old gentlemen of the place to relate their stores and pass away the time. It is particularly remembered as being the resort of Isaiah Steen, Squire John Wilson, and Robert Knox. A lean-to was built on the south side of the market-house, where the fire-engine was kept. This market-house was in use until the demands of the county required a new court-house, and in 1839 arrangements were made with the commissioners for an exchange of property, as will be found in the account of the town hall. A market-house was erected in the spring of 1840, on the north side of the public square fronting on Cherry Alley, and opened for business August 2d of that year. This market-house on Cherry Alley was used until the erection of the town hall in 1869, when it was torn down. Upon the erection of the new hall the rear of the lower story was used for market purposes until June 7, 1878, when the Council ordered the market-house to be fitted up for an engine-house and the old engine-room used as a market.1\n\n1 The reason of the market-house being set back from the main street was that on the 3d of June, 1817, the commissioners laid off three lots on the public square, Nos. 1, 2, 3, twenty-two by twenty-four feet each, being sixty-six feet front on Main Street, and twenty-four feet on Cherry Alley. These lots were leased for twenty-five years, No. 1 to William Hunter, it being the north lot; No. 2, the centre one, to John Neal; No. 3, the south one, to David Shields. On these lots a brick building was to be erected one story in height, covering the whole area and under one roof, and to be built in range with the public offices. On the 20th of June, the commissioners thinking it would be better to have the building two stories in height, agreed with the lessees, Hunter, Neal, and Shields, in consideration of erecting the building two stories in height, to release them from the first five years' annual rent. The buildings were thus erected, and when the market-house was built the lease had not yet expired.\n\nFire Department. Â– The first fire which occurred in the town of Washington of which any account is obtained was the burning of the log court-house in the winter of 1790-91. The accounts of the commissioners of 1791 contain the following: \"To pay James Marshel for the use of his engine, $25.\" What kind of an engine was owned by Col. Marshel, or for what purpose he obtained it, is not known, as no further reference to it is found.\n\nIn the history of the incorporation of the borough reference is made to an article signed \"An Inhabitant of Washington,\" and dated Feb. 2, 1796, in which he says, speaking of the powers of a borough, \"It could make provision against a calamity which every reflecting man must dread Â– fire. In vain is our fire-engine if we want water; and it is well known that in a dry season there is not one-tenth part of the water necessary in case of a fire breaking out, yet there is no authority to dig wells in the street.\" It is evident from the above that at that time a fire engine was owned and kept for public use by the town. And in a bill presented to the commissioners in the year 1797 \"the Engine-House\" is mentioned. In an article which was published in the Reporter of Jan. 13, 1817, \"A Citizen,\" speaking of a recent fire and the existing fire system, says, \"We have had more than twenty years' experience of the inefficiency of the present system.\" This implies that a fire company was organized about that time (1797), and was in possession of an engine. On the 18th of May, 1801, the \"Washington Fire Company\" was organized with a roll of eighty-two members. The engine was placed under the care of two directors and sixteen men. On the 15th of January, 1816, notice was given by Henry Yanaway, high constable, to the citizens of the borough to meet at the court-house on the 16th, \"for the purpose of determining whether the taxes of the borough shall be so far increased as may be necessary for the purchase of a fire-engine.\" No account of this meeting is found. There was existing in that year a fire company called \"The Franklin Fire Company,\" and John Cunningham, secretary, notified the company to meet at the court-house on the 16th of April. The Reporter, of February, 1822, gives an account of the meeting of the citizens of the borough of Washington, held at the court-house on the 18th of February of that year. The Rev. Thomas Hoge was called to the chair, and Joseph Henderson was chosen secretary. The object of the meeting was to direct the burgesses and Council of the borough to purchase \"a new water-engine\" out of the corporation funds. John Johnson, John Wilson, Alexander Reed, Daniel Moore, and William Sample were appointed a committee to wait upon the commissioners of the county at their next meeting and \"ascertain how much they will subscribe for the purpose of purchasing a new engine and apparatus.\" The burgesses and Council were instructed to ascertain how much can be raised by subscription for the purpose of making reservoirs, the subscribers to have credit in their taxes; they were also requested to pass an ordinance requiring every person owning a house of the value of $400 to purchase two leather fire-buckets. The meeting adjourned to March 14th, the same year, at which time the \"Hope Fire Company\" was organized.\n\nOn Saturday night, Feb. 23, 1822, about twelve o'clock, the law-office of Thomas M. T. McKennan and a house adjoining took fire and were both destroyed. After the fire was nearly over and the citizens mostly dispersed, the double stack of chimneys in the two-story frame house fell and killed four persons and wounded five others. The names of those killed were Henry Taylor, son of Matthew Taylor, about seventeen years of age; James Wilson, the youngest son of John Wilson, Esq., who was about fifteen years of age, and a student in Washington College; Jeremiah Decker, a married man, and by trade a mason; and Joseph Decker, Jr., about twelve years of age, and a son of Joseph Decker. Of the wounded, Alexander Addison, a son of Judge Alexander Addison, and a promising attorney, died on the 28th of February following from injuries received. David Lingerfelter, a young man seventeen years of age, was wounded by the fire-engine as it was returning from the fire. Lockjaw set in, and he died on the 8th of March.\n\nThe following facts are found in the newspapers and records concerning the \"Hope Fire Company:\" It is first mentioned in1822. R. W. Harding was its secretary in May, 1824. An annual meeting was held May 29, 1824, and the following officers were elected: Chief Director, Hugh Wilson; Engineers, William Hunter, John Wilson; Directors of the Ladder Company, James Ruple, James Kerr; Director of the Property Guard, Samuel Murdoch; Directors of the Water Company, Thomas M. T. McKennan, George Baird, William Robinson, George Kuntz; Treasurer, Jacob Slagle; Secretary, John R. Murdoch.\n\nIn 1825, the annual meeting passed without an election of officers. In 1826, C. M. Reed was secretary of the company. On the 9th of January, 1829, the following-named officers were elected: Chief Director, George Baird; Engineer, Dr. Francis J. Le Moyne; Assistant Engineer, Colin M. Reed; Captains of the Ladder and Axe Companies, John Wilson and Henry Chess; Captains of Water Company, Thomas M. T. McKennan and Alexander Reed; Captains of Property Guard, Rev. John Graham, Dr. Samuel Murdoch; Secretary, Alexander Wilson. The company continued for a few years, and then disbanded.\n\nOn the 11th of February, 1837, the \"Hope\" and \"Washington\" Fire Companies were reorganized, and the following were elected officers of the Hope Fire Company: Director, John Marshel; Engineers, Oliver Witherow, Jacob Keisler; Captain of the Water Companies, Jacob Slagle; Captains of the Axe and Ladder Company, Peter Wolf and John Wilson; Property Guard, Alexander Sweeney, Alexander Reed, Daniel Moore; Secretary, Henry Langley. This company maintained an existence for about fifteen or twenty years, then disbanded.\n\nAbout 1858 a company was organized and named the \"Hope Fire Company,\" which held its organization for several years, but through many discouragements. The next year (1859) an engine was purchased. In February, 1866, the records of the Council mention the \"New Hope Engine\" and purchase of fifty feet of hose. In November, 1870, the minutes of the Council mention the \"Hope Fire Company\" as lately organized, and on the 11th of December a committee from the company came before the Council and submitted a constitution, which was approved, and the Hope Engine was given in their charge. The engine at that time had eight sections of hose, two branch-pipes, three nozzles, four spanners for suctions, and three sections of suctions. The company has held its organization to the present time. The engine is kept in the engine-room in the town hall. The present officers are John P. Charlton, captain; James Matthews, first lieutenant; A. B. Means, second lieutenant. The company has at present (1882) sixty-five members.\n\nThe Washington Fire Company, of which mention is first made in 1801, evidently retained its organization, as in September, 1831, the burgess and Council ordered that the engines then under charge of the companies be kept in different parts of the borough. On the 11th of February, 1837, when the \"Washington\" and \"Hope\" Companies were reorganized, the following officers were elected by the Washington Company, viz.: Directors, Dr. John Wishart, William Smith; Engineers, Henry Shearer, Oliver Lindsey; Captains of the Water Companies, John Dagg, David White; Captains of the Axe and Ladder Company, Gen. Andrew Shearer, Freeman Brady; Property Guards, Abijah Johnston, Samuel Mount, John Shaffer; Secretary, John K. Wilson. From this time nothing more is learned of the company.\n\nSoon after the reorganization of the Hope and Washington Companies, another company was formed and named \"Good Intent.\" A small engine was purchased for their use, and in December, 1844, the company petitioned the Council for an engine-house, which was granted, and a house was erected on Pine Alley, and in the next year a hose-cart was procured.\n\nIn 1847 an engine bearing the name \"Eagle\" was purchased at Pittsburgh for the sum of eight hundred dollars. It has not been ascertained that it was under the charge of any company until the organization of the \"Eagle Fire Company\" in January, 1857. The officers were O. R. McNary, president; Marshall Griffith, secretary; John McKay, treasurer; John S. Clohey, captain; H. W. Wiley, lieutenant; Robert H. Elliott, first engineer; John McFarland, second engineer; O. R. McNary, captain of hose. The company disbanded after a few years, and the engine was sold.\n\nA company bearing the name of \"Good Will,\" having an engine in their care, was in existence in 1866, and on the 11th of December, 1871, the company appeared before the Council and presented a constitution, which was accepted, and the Council ordered the \"new suction-engine\" to be placed in their charge. At that time the engine called \"Good Will\" was still owned by the borough. Nothing more is ascertained of this company. On the 5th of February, 1872, the fire committee were instructed to purchase a \"Crane-Necker\" from Button & Son, but this was not done.\n\nOn the 8th of November, 1872, the citizens petitioned the burgess and Council to purchase a steam fire-engine. A committee was appointed to confer with the manufacturers of steam fire-engines, and on the 2d of December in that year the agents of the Amoskeag and Seneca Falls Companies visited the Council and presented their respective claims. On the 20th of January, 1873, the Council contracted with the agent of the Seneca Falls Company for a steamer for six thousand dollars. The burgess was authorized to call the citizens of Washington together for the purpose of forming a company to take charge of the new steamer. About one hundred and fifty persons were formed into a company, called the Citizens' Fire Company. The steamer (the \"Little Giant\") was given in charge of the Citizens' Company, which lasted but a short time, and another company was organized, with twelve members, and officered as follows: Samuel Brady, captain; Peter Cunningham, first lieutenant; George Thompson, chief engineer; and S. L. Wilson, assistant engineer. The company remained with this number about two years, when the number was increased to twenty; and after about two years the Council reduced the number again to twelve, and allowed each member two hundred dollars annually. On the 1st of July, 1879, the pay was increased to three hundred dollars each, annually, provided the company would keep twelve active members. They have at present the Little Giant engine, two hose-reels, and fourteen hundred feet of hose. The present members of the Little Giant Fire Company are Samuel Brady, captain; Jacob Beck, first lieutenant; Jacob Cline, chief engineer; Patrick Curran, first assistant; Charles Scott, second assistant; Thomas Buckalow, James Curran, Isaac Hunter, James Kennedy, William Seaburn, G. W. Thompson, T. D. M. Wilson.\n\nThe first action taken by the Council to provide public cisterns for fire purposes was in 1822, when they appropriated money to build reservoirs in different parts of the town. These had been kept in use to some extent until February, 1866, when the Council resolved to build new cisterns and repair the old ones. On the 19th of March in that year Chief Burgess Brady reported that he had contracted for three new cisterns, Â– one of two hundred barrels near John Harter's, one of three hundred barrels on the corner of Beau and Main Streets, and one of two hundred barrels on the corner of Main and Maiden Streets. On the 19th of May, 1874, the commissioners of the county met with the Council of the borough, and offered them one thousand dollars for the purpose of building one or more cisterns near the county buildings, which offer was accepted. The cisterns were built and completed in May, 1875.\n\nOn the 30th of June, 1879, the Council ordered a cistern built near the seminary; and on the 16h of August, 1880, ordered two cisterns built, with a capacity of five hundred barrels each, one near the foundry, the other near the corner of Ruple Alley and West Beau Street.\n\nThe present engine-house in the rear of the town hall, on the public square, was built in 1870. The Council accepted plans May 27, 1870, and authorized the burgess to advertise for proposals, which were received June 1st of that year, and contract given to Andrew Brady for seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars.\n\nOn the 20th of September, 1880, the Mechanics' Hook-and-Ladder Company was organized, and a new truck placed under their charge. The company consisted of seventeen members, and was officered as follows: Charles V. Harding, captain; James Curran, first lieutenant; William Blackhurst, second lieutenant. Their rooms are in the engine-house. The three engines, \"Good Intent,\" \"Good Will,\" and \"Eagle,\" all hand-engines, were sold for old iron.\n\nThe present property of the Fire Department is the engine-house, steamer, \"Little Giant,\" two hose-reels, fourteen hundred feet of hose; the \"Hope\" (hand engine), hose-reel, six hundred and fifty feet of hose, hook-and-ladder truck, six ladders, pikes, axes, and drags, the whole under the control of Fire-Marshal John McGuffie.\n\nTown Hall. Â– The first reference to a town hall in Washington borough is found in a deed made in October, 1839, by the county commissioners to the borough of Washington, in which it is recited that whereas the commissioners of the county on the 21st of June, 1816, did grant to the inhabitants of the borough a certain part of the public square to be used as a market place, and whereas the (then) present commissioners \"are about to cause to be erected new public buildings upon the said square, and are desirous of obtaining for the use of the County that part thereof so granted as aforesaid, and upon which the present market-house is built, and Whereas the Citizens of the said Borough in Town Meeting have signified their willingness to relinquish all their right and interest in and to the said ground provided the said Commissioners do grant and convey to the Burgesses and Inhabitants of the said Borough a part or portion of the opposite or southern end of the said square for the purpose of erecting thereon a new Market House and Town Hall;\" for which reasons the commissioners \"do give and grant unto the Borough and Inhabitants of the said Borough the following part or portion of the public square aforesaid viz Â– Beginning at a point on the northern edge of _________ alley on a line with the front of the new court house hereafter to be erected, thence north fifty feet, thence west _______ feet to the fence now enclosing the public ground in the rear of the brick building occupied by Samuel Surratt and others, thence South fifty feet to the Northern edge of the said alley and thence along said alley to the place of beginning for and in exchange of and for all the rights and interest of the said Borough in and to that part of the public square upon which the present market house is erected, and the said Burgesses and Inhabitants of the said Borough have likewise on their part given and granted and by these presents do fully freely and absolutely give and grant unto the said Commissioners for the use of the County all that part of portion of the public square now occupied as a market place and all their right and interest in the same by virtue of the within instrument aforementioned. To Have and to Hold the said parts or portions of the said public square so as aforesaid exchanged unto the said Burgesses and Inhabitants of the said Borough and unto the Commissioners and their successors forever. Provided always nevertheless that the said Burgesses and Inhabitants aforesaid are to use and enjoy the said ground hereby granted and exchanged for a market place and for the creation of a market house and Town Hall and for no other purpose whatsoever.\"\n\nIt will be seen by this deed that a part of the public square was leased to the borough on which to build a market-house in 1816, and this deed was an exchange of location on the public square by reason of the proposed erection of a new court-house. On this land so exchanged the borough erected a market fronting the alley, and the old one then standing where the sheriff's house now stands was sold. On the 3d of March, 1842, the borough of Washington purchased the old brick buildings on the public square for $360. Two days later the commissioner of the county resolved to deduct thirty-three per cent of the purchase money of above buildings \"in consideration of erecting an engine-house on the public square, which was afterwards built in the rear of the market-house. On the 5th of May, 1842, the commissioners \"granted, bargained, and sold\" to the borough of Washington the lot on which the public offices stood, as is shown by the record of the commissioners of that date, viz.: \"All the public ground on the public square lying south of a line commencing at the curbstone on Main Street, nine feet south of the new court-house, and running west until it strikes a lot of Mr. Smith, late the property of William Hunter, deceased. In consideration of said grant the burgesses and inhabitants aforesaid agree to erect a town hall on said ground, otherwise the conveyance to be inoperative and of no effect, . . . as per deed dated and concluded on May 5, 1842, and recorded.\"\n\nThe Council of the borough of Washington, on the 23d of March, 1843, appointed a committee, consisting of Robert Officer, John S. Brady, and Thomas McGriffin, to report a plan and probable cost of a town hall, which committee made a report which was accepted. A plan was presented by Mr. Erret and adopted by the Council. An article published in the Examiner two days later says, \"About eight or ten months since at a meeting of citizens nineteen-twentieths of the people who acted declared in favor of the erection of a hall. A disagreement as to the mode of raising money had sprung up. One proposition was to procure the passage of an act to empower the Council to borrow money, the other was by direct taxation. The Council called another meeting of the citizens, but before the meeting was held the committee reported a plan to the Council which was adopted. At the meeting held the 6th of May, in response to the call mentioned above, the citizens refused to sanction any method of raising money, and the project for a town hall was laid over indefinitely.\"\n\nNo further effort towards the erection of a town hall was made until 1868. The commissioners of the county on the 4th of May in that year requested the Borough Council of Washington to remove the market-house and council chamber from the public square. On the 19th of May a committee of the Borough Council met with the commissioners to discuss the question of tearing down and removing the public buildings of the borough on the public square of the county, and the erection of a new engine building, with council chamber, town hall, etc. No definite conclusion was reached, and on the 16th of November, 1868, at a meeting of the Council, it was resolved that the citizens be called \"to take into consideration the erection of a public building for a town hall and engine-house.\" On the 22d of December of the same year the generous offer of Dr. F. J. LeMoyne was made to donate \"from five to ten thousand dollars for a public library, provided the borough put up suitable buildings.\" The question was then discussed as to the propriety of erecting a town hall with rooms for the above purpose. On the 5th of January, 1869, the commissioners conferred with a committee from the Council on the subject. The following is from their records:\n\n\"This evening was appointed for a meeting with a committee from the Borough Council to confer in regard to the erection of a town hall, engine-house, and council chamber on the public square. Committee from the Council, Messrs. John McElroy and Samuel Hazlett, D. S. Wilson, Esq., attorney for the commissioners, being present, stated that if the borough could satisfy the county the above erections would subserve a public benefit in the way of protecting the public buildings, then the commissioners might safely ask the Legislature to confer upon them the right to grant the ground for the purposes of the above buildings. And it was therefore agreed by the commissioners if the borough would erect such buildings as would meet their approval, they the commissioners would join with the Borough Council in a prayer to the Legislature to confer upon them (the commissioners) the power to grant or lease so much of the southeastern portion of the public square to the borough for the term of not less than fifty years for the purpose of erecting the said buildings.\"\n\nAt a meeting of citizens held at the court-house, Jan. 15, 1869, the subject was thoroughly discussed and considered favorably. On the 18th of January the Council ordered a special election to be held on the 2d of February, the result of which is shown by the following resolution of the Council on the 15th of February: \"Whereas, an election of the citizens of Washington was held on Tuesday, the 2d day of February, 1869, to decide the erection of a town hall, said election resulted in a vote of eighty-nine majority to erect said building; therefore, resolved, a committee, consisting of three persons, viz., J. D. Boyle, John McElroy, and T. Hazlett, was appointed to meet and arrange with the commissioners of Washington County for a lease of sufficient ground on the public square upon which to erect said building.\"\n\nOn the 18th of January, J. D. Boyle, chief burgess, and Samuel Hazlett were appointed a committee to obtain plans and specifications for a town hall and submit them to the Council. This committee procured plans and specifications from Joseph Kerr, an architect, of Pittsburgh, which were approved. The committee appointed to meet the reported that it was decided to ask the Legislature for the passage of an act authorizing the commissioners to lease a portion of the public grounds to the borough of Washington on which to erect a town hall, to be used as a post-office, and for other purposes. A petition was so presented to the Legislature, and an act passed to that effect (approved Feb. 16, 1869). On the next day (February 17th) an act was passed \"authorizing the borough of Washington to borrow a sum of money not to exceed thirty thousand dollars, to be applied to the erection of a town hall in said borough upon the ground leased by the commissioners of Washington County to said borough of Washington for that purpose.\" The lease was made, and on the 5th of May, 1869, the chief burgess was authorized to advertise for proposals to furnish four hundred thousand bricks, and to sell the old market-house at auction. On the 17th of February, 1869, Messrs. John Boyle, James McElroy, and Samuel Hazlett, committee on town hall building, reported that \"it was agreed by the commissioners that the said building should be placed at the distance of twenty-six feet from the south side of the Court-House. . . . Agreed, that no Market-House, Rooms, or Stalls shall be connected with the said Town Hall building, or be erected upon any part of the Public Square. . . . It was also agreed that the county would lease to the borough fifty by one hundred feet for the term of fifty years for the purpose of erecting the said buildings, or so much less of the Southeastern part of the Public Square as may be occupied by said building. . . . It was further agreed that the commissioners would approve a Building which should cost from twenty to thirty thousand dollars, and be of modern style of architecture.\" The lease was made by the commissioners March 12, 1869.\n\nThe following action was taken by the commissioners on the 2d of March 1869:\n\n\"It was agreed by Commissioners McLean and Kerr to appropriate Eight Hundred dollars to the Borough for the purpose of putting a Slate roof on the Town Hall buildings. This appropriation is made in consideration of the said Town Hall building containing Engine Rooms in which Engines are to be kept, thereby affording protection to the Court-House and other County property, and for the further reason that the erection of said Town Hall Building the County will be saved the expense of erecting an iron fence upon that part of the public square occupied by said Buildings, which said fence is supposed to cost about the Eight Hundred Dollars appropriated, and, finally, for the reason that the erection of the Town Hall on the Public Square will save the County Room in wear and tear in the way of public meetings to the amount of some three hundred dollars annually.\"\n\nThe proposals were received by the Council and opened May 12th. The contract for the bricks was awarded to Andrew Ford. On the 9th of August, 1869, the contract for the brick- and stone-work was awarded to Andrew Brady, the carpenter-work to J. N. Porter, and the tin-work to Jesse Jordan. On the 18th of September, 1869, the corner-stone was laid by President Grant, with imposing Masonic ceremonies. In the corner-stone was deposited a box containing many articles of local and national interest. The work was carried forward from this time with rapidity, and on the 1st of April, 1870, the post-office was removed to the new quarters by William C. Wylie, postmaster. The Council met for the first time in the council chamber on the 5th of August, 1870. The funds for the erection of the building were disbursed by Samuel Hazlett, who paid out $31,518.51, that being the total cost. The building is fifty-six feet on Main Street, and extends back one hundred feet on Cherry Alley, with a basement under the whole building. An office in the southeast corner of the basement is occupied by the Western Union Telegraph Company. The first floor is occupied by the post-office, reading- and library-room, with a fire-proof vault and an engine-house. The second floor contains an audience-room (with a capacity for seating one thousand persons) and a council chamber.\n\nPost-Office and Postmasters. Â– By the Postmaster-General's report of 1792 it is shown that there were then no post-offices in the county. A list of letters was advertised in the columns of the Western Telegraphe some time before the name of the postmaster who signed to it. It is ascertained from an assessment-roll of 1796 that Gabriel Blakeney was assessed in that year as store-keeper and postmaster. As far as is known, he has the honor of being the first postmaster of Washington. Mr. Blakeney retired from business in that year, having advertised to close business, and calling for settlement in December, 1795. He was succeeded by William Meetkirke, whose name as postmaster appears with the list of advertised letters, Oct. 2, 1797. It is evident that David Moore became his successor, but at what time is not known. The assessment-roll of 1803 contains the name of Daniel Moore as merchant and postmaster, and also Hugh Wylie, merchant and postmaster. It would seem from this that in the early part of the year Daniel Moore was in office, and Hugh Wylie the latter part; each one assessed the same. Hugh Wylie remained postmaster until 1828, keeping the office where J. Shan Margerum's store now is. He was succeeded by Joseph Henderson, who kept the office on the Round Corner, where James C. Acheson's store now is. He was succeeded the next year, 1829, by Thomas Morgan, who kept a store first in a house now occupied by Mrs. Swan, and later moved to the property long known as the Globe Inn, and in that part of it now occupied by Dr. Kaine's office. In 1839 he was succeeded by Samuel Workman, who kept the office where Patrick J. Finn now keeps a store. In 1840, Robert Colmery was appointed. During the first part of his term the office was kept in an old building where Smith's store now stands, and later was moved to the old log (weatherboarded) building which stood on the site of Washington Savings-Bank building. On the 1st of April, 1845, Jonathan D. Leet succeeded him, and held the position till March, 1850, when he was superseded by James McDermott, who moved the office to the house now occupied by Homer Seamon. At the close of his term David Acheson was appointed, and held the office four years. Feb. 17, 1857, George W. Aiken was appointed, and retained his position until Aug. 1, 1858, when Freeman Brady took possession. He remained until the spring of 1861, when James McDermott was again appointed.\n\nDuring the terms of Acheson, Aiken, Brady, and a part of McDermott's the office was kept in the building where the savings-bank now is. The remainder of McDermott's term the office was kept on the spot where Samuel Templeton's residence now stands. Aug. 4, 1865, William C. Wylie was appointed postmaster, and still holds the position. During his term the office was first kept where Morgan & Hargreaves' store now is. The building was burned Feb. 2, 1866, and the office was removed to the building now occupied by Gen. John Hall, where it remained one year, and was again removed to a building of Mr. John Lockhart's, now occupied by H. M. Seaman as a jewelry-store, and on the 15th of April, 1870, was removed to the present office in the town hall.\n\nThe Press of Washington. Â– The Western Telegraphe and Washington Advertiser, an ultra-Federalist journal printed at Washington, was the first paper ever published in Washington County. The editors and proprietors were John Colerick, William Hunter, and W. H. Beaumont. The first number was issued on the 17th of August, 1795, having for its motto, \"Free, but not licentious.\" The office was in a building nearly opposite the market-house, which then stood on the northeast corner of the public square. About the same time the firm opened a book-store, and on the 5th of January, 1796, advertised that they \"have completed the necessary arrangements for carrying on the book-binding business, and that they are preparing to put a spelling-book to press.\" In the same month they published \"Mrs. Barbauld's Lessons.\" The following are works the firm soon after published: June 28th, \"a new Spelling-Book is this day published by Colerick, Hunter & Beaumont, Price, one quarter of a dollar; Dilworth's Spelling-Book Improved.\" October 8th, \"The New England Primer.\" January, 1797, \"Beveridge's Private Thoughts.\" May, 1797, \"The Gentleman's Pocket Farrier, Price 20 cents.\" On the 17th of May, 1797, the firm dissolved, John Colerick continuing the publication. On the 6th of June William Hunter and W. H. Beaumont advertised in the columns of the Telegraphe and Advertiser that they had been invited to establish a newspaper in Washington, Ky., and that they intended to commence a newspaper \"on a Royal Sheet in folio.\" The Telegraphe was continued by Colerick until about 1807-8. In the assessment-roll of 1808-9 the name of Alexander Armstrong appears assessed as a printer and editor of the Western Telegraphe. How much longer the paper existed is not known. The Reporter of Aug. 12, 1811, refers to \"the piece over the signature of 'an Old seventy-sixer' published in the Federal paper of this town of Thursday last.\" It is evident that at this time the paper was still published. The only copies of this paper now known to exist are in possession of Judge A. W. Acheson, and extend from Aug. 24, 1795, to the latter part of 1797.\n\nThe Herald of Liberty, established by John Israel, was published in Washington, and the first issue of the paper appeared on the 6th of February, 1798, bearing the motto, \"Man is man, and who is more?\" The office was in a building opposite the court-house. The paper was a four-column folio, eleven by seventeen inches in size. It continued until the paper reached No. 45. That number and Nos. 46 and 47 were reduced in size to eight by thirteen inches, as the publishers stated, \"by reason of the scarcity of paper;\" with No. 48 the paper resumed its original size. On the 11th of February, 1799, Vol. II., No. 59, appeared with a new heading. On the 12th of February the same year there was published from the Herald of Liberty office \"A Dose for Federalists, or the Letters of Curtius, together with a pill for Democrats vulgarly called the Alien and Sedition Laws. Price an eleven-penny-bit.\" There was also published, June 12, 1799, \"A Defense of Believers' Baptism, with a reply to the arguments made use of against it in a public dispute held at Georges Creek, Fayette County, Sept. 29, 17978, between Rev. V. Cook, Methodist preacher, and John Corbley, pastor of the Baptist Church, Muddy Creek, Greene County.\" At the time of the change of heading in February, 1799, Mr. Israel gave his circulation as \"now 1296 papers weekly and list increasing.\" On the 25th of November the same year there was published \"A Touch at the Times, price 6 cents;\" and April 4, 1800, \"An Introduction to English Grammar designed for teh use of Schools.\" On the 7th of July, 1800, the editor, John Israel, made proposals \"For publishing a weekly newspaper in the Borough of Pittsburgh entitled the Tree of Liberty by John Israel & Co. To commence the 16th of August.\" The Herald was to be continued under the same management. The Tree of Liberty was commenced as proposed. In February, 1801, the office was removed \"to the house formerly occupied by Daniel Moore, Esq., at the corner of Market and Belle Streets\" (now Main and Wheeling). It is not known how long the Herald was continued. The only known copies are in one volume now in possession of Judge A. W. Acheson. It commences May 14, 1798, No. 15, and is continuous to Vol. IV., No. 206, dated January 18, 1802.\n\nThe Washington Reporter. Â– It is stated that in the year 1808, when William Sample was passing through the town of Washington with the fixtures of a printing-office, intending to locate further west, he was persuaded to remain in Washington and establish a paper. An office was procured in \"The Swan,\" corner of Market and Belle Streets (now the Valentine House), and on the 15th of August in that year the first number of the Washington Reporter, 11 Â½ by 18 inches in size, was issued by William Sample and B. Brown (brothers-in-law). On the 10th of April, the next year, the office was removed from \"The Swan\" to the first door below the post-office in Main Street, and in April, 1810, moved to the northeast corner of Cherry Alley, on Main Street, near the court-house, it being \"the mansion house of David Redick, deceased,\" and in April, 1811, again moved to the house \"next door south of Samuel Shannon, Esq., and one door north of Hugh Workman's, on Main Street, third square south of the court-house.\" At this place the office remained until March, 1813, when it was moved to the fourth square south of the court-house, and on the 1st of January, 1816, was moved back to its previous quarters, where it remained till after 1823.\n\nOn the 9th of February, 1810, the firm of Brown & Sample was dissolved, Brown retiring, and Sample remaining editor till his appointment as prothonotary in 1819, when on the 31st of May in that year he was succeeded by Samuel Workman, who commenced a new series, Vol. I., No. 1. At the expiration of Mr. Sample's term as prothonotary in May, 1821, he again became the editor and assumed the management, which he retained till 1833, when he sold out to B. S. Stewart and George W. Acheson, and removed West.1 In 1835 the above firm closed out their interests to John Ramsey and S. B. Robinson, who published the paper until the 1st of November, 1836, when Uriah W. Wise became the proprietor. At this time the paper was a six-column folio, 17 by 22 inches in size. On the 6th of November, 1839, John Bausman purchased the paper and commenced its publication, changing it from six columns to seven. By him it was continued till April 22, 1848, when John W. F. White became associated with him. This partnership continued till Feb. 16, 1852, when Mr. White retired, and on the 16th of February, 1856, James G. and Robert Strean became the proprietors. The paper was continued two years under this management until 1858, when on the consolidation of the Commonwealth (then owned by William Moore and E. L. Christman) with this paper the firm-name was changed to Moore, Strean & Co. Mr. Christman retained his interest, but retired from its active duties. On the 28th of March, 1860, Robert F. Strean retired, and the Washington Tribune became consolidated with it (then owned by H. A. Purviance and James Armstrong). The firm was then known as Moore, Purviance & Armstrong.\n\n1 William Sample in 1812 was captain of the Washington Light Infantry, and commanded a company in the war. He married Margaret, daughter of Hugh Workman, by whom he had four sons, Â– David, Workman, William, and Samuel. David emigrated South and died there. Workman married here and lived for a time, emigrated West, and later settled in Keokuk, Iowa, where he became mayor of the city, and died there. William emigrated to Natchez, Miss., where he lived and died. His wife, Margaret, died in Washington, after which he married Jane, daughter of James Blaine and sister of Ephraim L. Blaine, by whom he had two daughters. After the sale of the Reporter in 1833 he removed to Fort Madison, Iowa, taking with him his youngest son, Samuel, and his daughters, Sarah J. and Margaret. William Workman and Workman Hughes, of Washington, are his nephews.\n\nIn 1860 a campaign paper was published at the office, called The Maul and Wedge, which did active duty for Lincoln and Hamlin. During the war three of the proprietors Â– Col. H. A. Purviance, Col. James Armstrong, and Maj. E. L. Christman Â– were in the army. Upon the death of Col. Purviance, the paper was published by Moore & Armstrong from Nov. 11, 1863, to Nov. 20, 1867, when Col. James Armstrong retired, and James McWilliams succeeded to his interest and remained till Feb. 11, 1869, when his interest was purchased by James W. Kelly. On the 16th of April, 1873, E. L. Christman returned and took charge with Mr. Moore, the interest of Mr. Kelly being absorbed in the new arrangement. Under this firm The Daily Reporter was established, and issued, the first number Aug. 4, 1876, four columns folio, eleven by fifteen inches in size. Upon the retirement of Mr. Moore, Oct. 22, 1877, Alexander M. Gow purchased the interest, and the firm-name became Gow & Christman, by whom the business is still continued.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1858 the office of the Reporter was in a building now occupied by Dr. James R. Kelly, opposite the Fulton House stables. In 1858, after the consolidation with the Commonwealth, the office was moved to the Mounts building, opposite the old Bradford stone house, and in 1861 it was removed to the present quarters in Strean's building.\n\nThe Western Missionary Magazine, published in Washington, Pa., was commenced in 1802, and continued till 1806. Nothing more is known of it.\n\nThe Western Corrector. No copies of this paper are known to be in existence. The first proof of its publication is that in the year 1809, Thomas Thompson was assessed as editor of The Western Corrector. In the year 1811 handbills were printed at the office of The Western Corrector, at Washington, Pa., for David Redick, advertising lands in Beaver County.\n\nThe Washingtonian, a weekly newspaper, was established at Washington, Pa., in 1812, the first number being issued Tuesday, December 15th, in that year, having for its motto, \"The minority possess their equal rights which equal laws must protect, and to violate would be oppressive. Jefferson.\" It was a four-column folio, twelve by seventeen and a half inches in size, and published at two dollars per annum, by James A. Bayard, Jr., editor. The office was in Market Street, nearly opposite the recorder's office. One and a half columns of the first page were devoted to the prospectus, and the remainder was filled with a report of national legislative proceedings. It also contains the official report (dated Nov. 24, 1812) of Capt. James Jones, of the sloop-of-war \"Wasp,\" of the capture of his vessel. There is no local news, and but one column is devoted to local advertisements. How long it continued is not known. The only copy known to be in existence is the one mentioned, and is in the possession of Alexander Hart, of the Washington Democrat.\n\nThe Mercury was published about 1812. No information is obtained of its history, and its existence is only known by mention in contemporary papers.\n\nIn the year 1811 an advertisement appeared in the local papers for proposals for publishing by subscription, at Washington, Pa., a literary periodical work, entitled \"The Washington Museum,\" under the patronage of a society of gentlemen, sixteen pages octavo, weekly, price $3 per annum, under the management of William Baird, editor. No further notice of it is found.\n\nThe Western Register, a magazine, was published by Robert Fee, from the office of the Reporter, in the winter of 1816-17. A year or two later he removed to Fayette County and commenced the publication of the magazine in Uniontown, where he continued till after 1823.\n\nThe Washington Examiner, John Grayson editor and proprietor, was first issued (ten by eighteen and a quarter inches in size) May 28, 1817. The causes that operated to bring about the establishment of this paper in Washington are explained by Mr. Grayson, as follows: Â“My acquaintance in the city of Philadelphia among young men who espoused the Democratic-Republican cause being pretty extensive to some of them my desires were freely communicated as to my preference for a country residence. Hence, very early in the spring of 1817 (it was soon after the 4th of March, when William Findlay was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania at the ensuing election by the Democratic convention, which had just adjourned), a friend in that city wrote to me that a Democratic paper was about to be started in Washington, Pa, for the purpose of supporting Mr. FindlayÂ’s election, and that an editor was wanted to take charge of it. From this information a correspondence commenced between George Baird and myself which led to the establishment of the Examiner; went immediately from Baltimore to the city of Philadelphia, where I purchased type, presses, and other materials on my own responsibility, with the endorsement of the late William Brown, of that city; forwarded them forthwith to Washington, Pa.; came myself by stage-coach, arriving on May 10, 1817, and issued the first number of the Examiner on the 28th of that month. One fact may be mentioned, that in issuing the first number of the Examiner my subscription amounted to 400.Â”\n\nThe paper was first printed in an old frame building on Maiden Street, which occupied the site on which the brick Masonic Hall was afterwards erected. Mr. Grayson remained sole proprietor until Nov. 18, 1833, when William Jack became interested with him, and remained until May 14, 1836 when he retired, and the paper was continued by Mr. Grayson until May 18, 1839, when he retired from the active duties, and his son, Thomas W. became associated with him, under the firm-name of Thomas W. Grayson & Co. This continued until June 25, 1842, when John Grayson sold out his interest to C. W. Kaine, who then owned Our Country, and in September of the same year James B. Ruple purchased the interest of Mr. Kaine. On the 18th November, 1848, Mr. Ruple retired, and Mr. Andrew Hopkins became the owner of his interest. Under this management the paper was changed to seven columns, and the size increased to nineteen and a half by twenty-five inches. Mr. Hopkins sold to George S. Hart, May 2, 1853, and he to Adam Ecker on the 20th of December, 1856. The firm remained Grayson & Ecker until Dec. 29, 2859, when Thomas W. Grayson, after twenty-one and a half yearsÂ’ services as editor, sold his interest in the Examiner to John R. Donahoo, by whom it was continued with Mr. Ecker some time, and Donahoo sold to D. F. Patterson. On the 4th of October, 1865, the Examiner became consolidated with the Review, under the firm-name of Swan & Ecker, and the paper was published as Review and Examiner, and is still continued under that name.\n\nThomas W. Grayson, on the 28th of May, 1857, and the fortieth anniversary of the Examiner, says, Â“The paper was first printed in an old frame building on Maiden Street, in this place, and which occupied the site on which the first Masonic lodge was afterwards erected [now owned and occupied by Mrs. John Bausman]. The old frame building now stands on a lot belonging to the heirs of John Philips, deceased, near the west end of the same street [now owned by Chares Hays & Co.].Â” He further says, Â“For weeks in succession the then editor of the Examiner would collect a small amount, and with it repair to Redstone paper-mill, in Fayette County, purchase the necessary material, return home after making a forced journey during the whole of the night, go to work and help out with the paper the same week.Â” The paper did not remain long on Maiden Street, as the issue of July 9, 1817, says the office was removed into Main Street, second door below the sign of Â“The Buck.Â” On the 1st of April, 1818, it was removed to No. 5, over the market-house, second door fronting on Beau Street. Here the office remained till April 28, 1827, when it was removed to the Old Lodge building, a short distance below the Â“BuckÂ” tavern on the east side of Main Street, and in the rear of the old Grayson House. For a period of forty-one years the Washington Examiner was published by John Grayson, succeeded by his son, Thomas W. Grayson.\n\nOur Country was established in Washington by Thomas J. Morgan. The first number was issued on the 6th of June 1835. It was a six-column folio, fifteen and a half by twenty inches in size, Democratic in politics and hoisted in the first number of the name of Martin Van Buren for President and Henry A. Muhlenburg for Governor. Upon the breaking out of the Texan war, and on the 8th of September, 1836, Thomas J. Morgan, in an editorial, announced that during his absence on duty in the field, his brother, William D. Morgan, would have the editorial care of the paper. This arrangement continued for some time. In 1842 the paper was in possession of C. W. Kaine, by whom it was consolidated with the Examiner.\n\nOn the 23rd of May, 1835, T. W. Haynes advertised that he proposed Â“to publish a monthly in pamphlet form, a literary newspaper, monthly, at one dollar per annum, from the office of the Examiner, styled the Western Pennsylvanian.Â”\n\nThe Washington Patriot was established in 1843, by Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne, as an advocate of Abolition principles, under the editorial management of Russell Errett. It was successful for a few years, and afterwards died out and was discontinued.\n\nThe Commonwealth was established by Seth T. Hurd, May, 1848, in the interest of the Whig party. It was continued by him till 1851, when he sold a one-half interest to George C. Stough, of Berks County, and soon after the other half-interest. In November of the next year E. L. Christman, of Chester County, Pa., purchased a half-interest. This partnership continued until the death of Mr. Stough in December, 1855. His interest was then purchased by Joseph S. Clokey. Under this firm the paper espoused the cause of the Republican party, and continued till February, 1857, when the interest of Mr. Clokey was sold to the Hon. William S. Moore. The paper was continued by Moore & Christman until April 1, 1858, when it was consolidated with the Washington Reporter, and published by Strean, Moore & Co. as the Washington Reporter. The office of the paper was first in Oak Hall, a tavern stand where SmithÂ’s store now stands. After 1857 it was removed to MountÂ’s building, and was there published, both as the Commonwealth and the Reporter, until the removal to the present Reporter office.\n\nThe Washington Weekly Review was first published Oct. 9, 1851, by William Swan and ---- Ritezel. It was an eight-column paper, twenty by twenty-six inches in size, and in the interest of the Democratic party. During the year 1853, while Mr. Swan was on a tour to California, Mr. Ritezel was assisted in the editorial management by Barnet W. Lacy. In June, 1854, Ritezel retired, and Mr. Swan became sole proprietor and editor, and so remained until the consolidation with the Washington Examiner, October 4, 1865, when Mr. Swan became one of the editors o the Review and Examiner, and continued till his death, in October, 1876.\n\nThe Tribune was established by John Bausman, in 1856, as an exponent of Republican principles, and afterwards passed to Col. H. A. Purviance and Col. James Armstrong, and by them was continued till the consolidation with the Reporter, March 28, 1860. It was printed first where George Driver now lives, near TempletonÂ’s drug-store, and later near he present office of the Reporter.\n\nThe Review and Examiner was established by the consolidation of the Washington Review and the Washington Examiner, Oct. 4, 1865, and was published by William Swan and Adam H. Ecker. The paper retained the size of the Review, eight columns, twenty by twenty-six inches, and so continued till the 30th of September, 1868, when it was enlarged to nine columns and twenty-one by twenty-seven inches. The office was in the southeast corner of the public square directly opposite the post-office at that time, where HastingsÂ’ hardware-store now is. The paper was continued by Swan & Ecker until the death of Mr. Swan, in October, 1876. It was continued by Mr. Ecker until Jan. 31, 1877, when it was purchased by Andrew Hopkins, who soon after sold a one-half interest to W. C. Lyne, who remained about a year and sold his interest to Mr. Hopkins, Jan. 31, 1878, and continued sole proprietor till his death, March 5, 1880. The management of the estate of Mr. Hopkins devolved upon James H. Hopkins of Pittsburgh. J. M. Cooper, of Chambersburg, assumed the editorial management of the paper for the heirs on the 7th of April, 1880, and continued in charge until the sale of the Review and Examiner, Feb. 1, 1881, to John M. Stockdale, by whom it is still owned and edited. The office is now on Beau Street, east of Main.\n\nThe Washington Observer.---In October, 1871, the Advance was started as a monthly by H. C. Durant and M. A. Cooper. On the 1st of January, 1872, it was changed to a weekly. Mr. Cooper soon after retired, Erasmus Wilson, of Barnesville, Ohio, purchasing his interest, and on the 25th of April, the same year, Mr. Wilson purchased the interest of Durant. It was continued by Mr. Wilson till Sept. 5, 1872, when M. A. Cooper, one of the original proprietors, purchased a half-interest. The paper continued in the hands of these parties until about Jan. 1, 1873, when Mr. Wilson retired, and Mr. Cooper continued till the 1st of October, the same year, when B. F. Hasson, of Washington, purchased a half-interest. About the 1st of January following, Mr. Hasson purchased Mr. CooperÂ’s interest and continued the publication under the name of the Advance until March 4, 1874, when the name was changed to the Washington Observer. April 21, 1876, Harry J. Shellman bought a half-interest and on 29th September, the same year, sold to C. M. Campbell. On the 17th of October, 1879, J. S. Stocking and E. T. Acheson purchased the paper, and have continued publication till the present.\n\nThe paper was first printed in the building owned by John A. Best, on the corner of Main and Walnut Streets, and in 1872 the office was removed to BoyleÂ’s building, opposite the court-house. In 1874, it was removed to the Forrest building, on North Main Street, and in 1875 to its present office in Phoenix Row, on North Main Street.\n\nThe Washington Democrat.---This journal, as its name suggests, is a Democratic paper. It was established in the spring of 1878 by A. H. Ecker, Esq., the initial number being dated April 3, 1878. From the first it has been issued weekly (every Wednesday) from the office, on West Beau Street near Main, Washington, Pa. The size of the sheet is twenty-nine by forty-four inches. The Democrat was conducted by its founder until the death of that gentleman on the 28th of February, 1881, and then for the benefit of his family until the 11th of June, 1881, when it was purchased by Alexander Hart and John P. Charlton, associated as Hart & Charlton, who still own and issue the paper. Its present circulation is twenty-one hundred copies per week.\n\nThe First Presbyterian Church [1Contributed by the pastor, the Rev. James L. Brownson, D. D.]---Previous to the organization of the Presbyterian Church at Washington, Pa., 1793, the Presbyterians of the town and vicinity worshiped mainly with the church of Chartiers, near Canonsburg, which from 1775 until 1830 was under the pastoral care of the Rev. John McMillan, D. D., the first pastor west of the Alleghenies. The first notice of preaching in the town, found in the minutes of the old Presbytery of Redstone--itself also formed in 1781, and now known as the mother of Western churches and presbyteries,--is the application, Dec. 20, 1785, for the stated labors of Alexander Addison, then a licentiate of the Presbytery of Aberlow, Scotland, but afterwards a distinguished attorney, and the no less distinguished president judge of the district composed of the western counties of Pennsylvania, under the Constitution of 1790. The Presbytery of Ohio, embracing Washington, was organized out of a portion of Redstone in 1793, and in April following, Â“the congregation of Washington having represented to Presbytery that they had entered into an agreement with Mr. James Welsh, a licentiate under the care of the Presbytery of Transylvania, as stated supply for some time, the Presbytery heartily concurred therewith.Â” Mr. Welsh continued his services for about a year, after which, as before, only occasional preaching was enjoyed from members of Presbytery and from traveling ministers. The names of the Rev. Messrs. Dodd, Mercer, Anderson, and Potter have come down in this connection, besides that of the Rev. Thomas Leslie Birch, who was the occasion of strife and alienation.\n\nThus it is plain that there was some sort of organization as early as 1785, yet the joint testimony of surviving witnesses and of general tradition is adverse to the supposition that there was a regular church prior to the winter of 1793-94. Then, in connection with the procurement of Mr. WelshÂ’s services as stated supply, the following four ruling elders were, after election by the people, duly set apart to office under the sanction of the Presbytery, and became the original session of the church, viz.: Andrew Swearingen, Joseph Wherry, Robert Stockton, and William McCombs. Simultaneous with the formal organization in 1793, and amidst the throes of the great Â“Western Insurrection,Â” was the election of the Â“Stone Academy,Â” under a charter secured seven years before, which still stands as the central structure of the Â“old college,Â” and a monument of history. For twelve years, besides its chief use for thorough training in classical literature, its hall furnished a comfortable place of worship for the first congregation of the town whereof we now write.\n\nThe Rev. Matthew Brown, D. D., so well known afterwards as a distinguished minister and educator, was installed as the first pastor Oct. 16, 1805. He was a son of Dickinson College, and for several years had been pastor of the church of Mifflin, Pa. He was simultaneously called to be the principal of the Washington Academy. In the following year, 1806, he was a chief agent in procuring by special charter, the transformation of the academy into Washington College, and thereafter for ten years served with distinguished success as its first president. He continued as pastor of the church six years longer, until Sept. 25, 1822, when he accepted the presidency of Jefferson College at Canonsburg.\n\nOne of the first movements of this energetic pastor was the effort to secure a permanent house of worship. The building was begun in the autumn of 1805 upon two lots in the southwestern part of the town, one of which was purchased from William Sherrard for five pounds, and the other from Andrew Swearingen, executor of the estate of Van Swearingen, for twenty dollars, the titles being made to Joseph Wherry, John Simonson, Parker Campbell, Hugh Wilson, and Daniel Moore, as trustees. The last two named gentlemen were Baptists in their convictions, but acted with the Presbyterian Church until the time came for the establishment of one of their own. The walls of the church at the height of a few feet stood over winter, and were completed and covered the following summer. It was a brick building of seventy by fifty-five feet in dimension, capable of seating five hundred persons. It was used for several years with unflustered walls, and without either pulpit or pews or permanent floor, for the lack of funds to complete it. Its original cost was about three thousand dollars. The first administration of the LordÂ’s Supper in it took place in June, 1807. It was occupied for the last time as a sanctuary on Sabbath, Sept. 7, 1851, when a commemorative discourse was preached by the present pastor from Psalm xlviii. 9: Â“We have thought of thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.Â” That building, having since been occupied for manufacturing purposes by the enterprising firm of S. B. & C. Hayes for thirty years, still stands among the most solid structures in the town.\n\nThe ministry of Dr. Brown was able, evangelical, and earnest. Through his efforts the congregation was thoroughly organized and greatly enlarged. The average of additions from 1810, when regular reports began to be made to Presbytery, until the end of his pastorate was fifteen per annum. The number of communicants at the time of his resignation, subtracting deaths and removals, was two hundred. Several seasons of special grace crowned his labors. That of the year 1811 was marked with great power, and started hallowed influences whose streams still flow. During his term of service James Brice, Josiah Scott, William Sherrard, Hugh Wylie, Thomas Stockton, Thomas Officer, Robert Johnston, Thomas Fergus, Obadiah Jennings, James Orr, and Dr. John Wishart were added to the session.\n\nThe Rev. Obadiah Jennings, D. D., formerly, as just stated, a ruling elder in the church, as well as a distinguished lawyer, and afterwards, by holy consecration, a minister of the gospel and pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Steubenville, Ohio, succeeded Dr. Brown in the pastorate in October, 1823, by a unanimous election. After a faithful service of nearly five years, he resigned the charge in 1828, in order to accept a call from Nashville, Tenn., where he died in honor in 1832. He was greatly beloved both as a pastor and a man, and his fragrant memory still abides, to the honor of Christ and the gospel. He was also an accepted leader in the public affairs of the church, and a master in debate. During his incumbency Messrs. Charles Hawkins, Robert Colmery, Jacob Slagle, Robert Officer, Adam Wier, and Alexander Ramsey were ordained as ruling elders. A spirit of religious inquiry manifested itself in the congregation shortly after Dr. Jennings had announced his purpose to remove, and too late, as he thought, for its recall. It developed into a precious revival, which extended many months after his actual departure, and resulted in a large spiritual increase. At the very time of his dismissal thirty-five additions to the church of profession of faith were reported for the year then closed, and the next year added fifty more. Through these happy months the pulpit was supplied by a nephew of the late pastor, the Rev. Samuel C. Jennings, now the venerable Dr. Jennings, of the Pittsburgh Presbytery, who lingers beyond fourscore years, waiting for the crown so sure to follow a devoted and useful life.\n\nIn the summer of 1829, a call was tendered to the Rev. David Elliott, D. D., of Mercersburg, Pa., which was accepted. He entered with the zeal and force of his high character upon this charge , in the forty-second year of his age and eighteenth of his ministry. He remained in it with the strongest mutual confidence and affection until he was called away by election of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, in 1836, to the chair of theology in the Western Theological Seminary at Allegheny City. Peach, edification, and progress reigned in the congregation during his pastorate of seven years. An annual average of twenty members added on profession of faith and of sixteen on certificate is evidence of the seal of blessing put upon his labors. A powerful work of grace in 1835 brought fifty-one confessors of Christ to the LordÂ’s table at one time. With faculties wonderfully preserved, and in the exercise of a faith that brightened to the last, he departed this life March 18, 1874, in the eighty-eighth year of his age and sixty-third year of his ministry. He left the church at his resignation with three hundred communicants on its roll. Messrs. Hugh Fergus and Samuel Vance were set apart to the eldership by his hands.\n\nThe next period of twelve years following Dr. ElliottÂ’s retirement from the congregation was marked with unusual frequency of change, and yet with the like tokens of stability and growth. Four vigorous, faithful, and honored watchmen stood in succession upon the walls of this Zion within this brief space, whilst during the intervals, making an aggregate of nearly one-third of it, the church was without a pastor. The lack was, however, well supplied, for the most part, by the able services of the Rev. David McConaughy, D. D., then president of Washington College. The pastoral service of the Rev. Daniel Dernelle extended from November, 1837, to October, 1840; that of the Rev. James Smith D. D., from December 1840 to April 1844; that of the Rev. William C. Anderson, D. D., from the early winter following to Jan. 9, 1846; and that of the Rev. John B. Pinney LL.D., from January, 1847, to April 1848. Differing widely in their respective gifts, each of these brethren did important work for Christ in his day, and not one of them was without tokens of a divine blessing upon his labors. Only the last of the four yet lingers on earth, and he is in lifeÂ’s decline. The people whom they served so well in the gospel have also for the most part passed away. But held in the hands of a covenant-keeping God, the church still lives. It was under the last-named pastor that Messrs. George Baird, Joseph Henderson, James Boon, and Dr. Robert R. Reed were chosen and set apart as rulers in the LordÂ’s house. At the same time Messrs. John Wilson, Isaac Hewitt, John K. Wilson, and John Grayson, Jr., were made deacons.\n\nThe present pastoral relation, dating from Jan. 1, 1849, has at the present writing, January, 1882, completed a period of thirty-three years, or an average human generation. Great changes have occurred in these years. On the present roll of three hundred and ninety-five communicants, only twenty-five remain of the two hundred and seventy-seven who greeted me at my settlement. Of course, also, including the eleven hundred and eighty-eight since received,--six hundred and thirty-nine on profession of faith, and five hundred and forty-nine by certificate from other churches,--one thousand and seventy are embraced in the lists of the deceased and the dismissed for this one generation. In all, fourteen hundred and sixty-five members of the church have sat down at the communion supper under the ministrations of the present pastor. The eleven venerable elders who Â“ruled wellÂ” at the opening of this pastorate have all years ago gone to their glorious reward. Three others, since introduced, have followed them, viz.: Messrs. Isaac Hewitt, James Ewing, and John Wiley. Four more who came into office under the present pastor have removed to other localities or church connections, viz.: J. Wilson Wishart, M.D., Harvey H. Clark, Edward G. Cundall, Jr., and John Hoon. The following seven elders still remain in office, viz.: Thomas McKennan, M.D., James C. Acheson, Thomas McKean, William David, M. Wilson McClane, William Paul and John Vance. The present deacons are John Aiken, George Davis, John B. Miller, Samuel M. Charlton, and George F. McCombs. The trustees of the congregation are John H. Ewing, A. Todd Baird, Alexander M. Brown, James W. McDowell, and Colin M. Reed, Jr. In the past the following gentlemen have filled the office of trustee, not a few of whom have been distinguished in the history of Washington County, and some in that of the State and nation, viz.: Joseph Wherry, John Simonson, Parker Campbell, Hugh Wilson, Daniel Moore, William McKennan, Hugh Wylie, Matthew Dill, Thomas McGiffin, James Orr, George Baird, Dr. John Wishart, Robert Taylor, John Gregg, Thomas Brice, John Mitchell, Isaac Vance, Alexander Gordon, Jacob Slagle, Thomas M. T. McKennan, John Wilson, David Eckert, Isaac Hewitt, Isaac Leet, John Potter, John Grayson, Sr., James Boon, Joseph Henderson, William Hughes, John K. Wilson, John Grayson, Jr., Thomas McKennan, James G. Strean, Thomas McKean, Alexander W. Acheson, Colin M. Reed, Sr., George Morgan, and Alexander Wilson. Only the last nine of these survive. Alexander Reed served as treasurer of the congregation twenty-seven years from 1809; Robert Officer, two years; Henry M. Koontz, five years; Colin M. Reed, Sr., twenty-seven years; and the present occupant, A. Todd Baird, has been in this office since 1869.\n\nSince the present pastorate commenced there have been, besides the ordinary work of the gospel, nine special seasons of grace, followed with ingatherings of new members into the church, varying in number from seventy down to twenty. The face is also recorded with peculiar thankfulness that forty-two young men have been here brought to Christ within the same period, who have since entered the ministry of the gospel, eighteen of whom were sons of this church by birth and training, and the rest students of the college from abroad. In the previous history of the church twenty-nine in like manner first sat down at the table of the Lord here and rose up to preach the unreachable riches of Christ, many in our own land and some on heathen shores. Sixty ministers of the gospel have found their wives in this congregation, thirty-two of them within the thirty-three years now under special review.\n\nDuring this same period the contributions of the church to objects outside beneficence, through the organized methods, have amounted to $48,849, or $1480.27 per annum. This includes the gifts of the Sabbath-school, and also those of the associations of ladies and of children. For the last ten years the aggregate has been $18,221, and the annual average $1822.10, or about $5 per member. The average per annum, for the same decade, of church expenses, including the pastorÂ’s salary, wages of sexton, repairs, fuel and light, and the support of the Sabbath-school has been $3620. Under the present pastorate there have also been two church elections, both of which have been provided for by special subscriptions; that of 1850-51 cost, in site, building, and furniture, $15,000. The reconstruction of 1868-69, embracing the whole building except the basement, cost $23,500, including furniture and organ. Within the same period, also, two strenuous efforts have been put forth in our midst for the endowment of our college, one in 1853 and the other in 1869, the aggregate amount realized from both being $60,000 or upwards, in which the members of this congregation bore a large proportion of the burden. Through the peculiar skill and energy of the treasurer, Mr. A. T. Baird, the church has for some years been entirely free from debt.\n\nThe influence of this church in the training of missionaries deserves fuller mention than our space will allow. Devoted laborers in the frontier destitutions of our own land, and in lands beyond the seas, can be counted by scores who have received there during their educational training at least part of the religious culture which prepared them for their work. More than forty years ago, the Rev. William Hamilton and his wife, Mrs. Julia McGiffin Hamilton, and the Rev. E. McKinney and his wife, carried the blessing of our church with them to the Indians beyond the Missouri, to be followed after a decade by Misses Mary H. McKeon and Flora Lee, who also counted not their lives dear to win souls. Mr. And Mrs. Cornes, who were sent into eternity in an instant by the explosion of a steamer in the harbor of Yokohama while in the prosecution of their work, will not be forgotten. Nor will the names of the sainted Clemens and his wife in Africa, or Dr. and Mrs. McFarland in Siam, or J. M. Alexander, the Newtons, Hull, Graham, and Mr. and Mrs. Ewing in India, Blachford in Brazil, Pitkin in Mexico, Miss Crouch in China, D. F. McFarland in New Mexico, Mrs. A. M. Darley in Southern Colorado, Miss Annie McKeon in Utah, and Misses Garrett and Bousman, formerly among the freedmen of the South, die out of memory. We knew them all here in the fellowship of Christ, and ten of the number, all females but one, were children of our church.\n\nHaving already, in compliance with the wishes of the gentleman who asked this paper at my hands, gone far beyond my own first conception as to its length, I am led further by request from the same source to add a sketch of the Sabbath-school connected with this church. This is all the more allowable, inasmuch as this school claims precedence in origin over all others west of the Alleghenies, and only defers in this respect to a few in the whole land. From its formal organization, June 15, 1816, it has come down in unbroken succession until now. The year of its origin stands out prominently in the history of the extensive and powerful revivals of religion, and the consequent large schemes of beneficence and Christian activity, which distinguished the first quarter of the present century. Sabbath-schools as they now exist in this country are generally traced to the labors of the Rev. Mr. May, a missionary from London, who came to Philadelphia in 1811, and organized a model school, giving it his care for a whole winter. Other schools soon followed, and in 1815, 1816, and 1817 they began to multiply in various parts of the country. The school of which we now write is older by eight years than the American Sunday-School Union, and only a month later in origin than the older of the two societies, out of which that Union was formed. But its conception even antedates its organization by more than two years.\n\nA meeting was held in Washing, Feb. 11, 1814, with David Morris, Esq., for its chairman and Dr. John Wishart for its secretary. Its triple purpose was to Â“provide for the proper administration of the poor laws,Â” to Â“discourage the use of spirituous liquors, and to suppress all vice and immorality,Â” and to Â“establish and support a Sunday-school for the education of indigent children.Â” The Rev. Matthew Brown, pastor of the Presbyterian Church, and two of his elders, Obadiah Jennings, Esq., and Dr. John Wishart, were appointed a committee to prepare a constitution for the society. When it came to fulfillment, as we have seen, in 1816, its declared purpose, so far as the Sunday-school was concerned, was Â“to instruct the children of Washington and vicinity, during the vacant hours of the Sabbath, in reading the Scriptures and other appropriate exercise.Â” A published report of the Â“Washington Sunday-School AssociationÂ” in 1818 speaks of the school as then having been in operation two years, and as having had an average of Â“one hundred and fifty pupils,Â” of whom Â“many have exhibited strong proofs of diligence and excellent capacity.Â” In form and name it was not at first strictly a denominational school, yet its sessions were held in the Presbyterian Church, and it was supported and managed by Presbyterians. And when, in 1825, the Methodist Episcopal school was established, and others, afterwards, it remained without change as the Presbyterian school.\n\nIt was eminently useful from the first, though some in the community thought it needless, and others a profanation of the Sabbath. On the 16th day of July, 1828, chiefly through the agency of this school, a Washington County Sunday-School Union, then only four years in existence, having for its object a general co-operation in this work, and the establishment of new schools throughout the county. It was reorganized in 1830, with the Hon. Thomas H. Baird as its president, and the Rev. Thomas Hoge as its secretary. The vice-presidents were the Revs. Messrs. David Elliott, D. D., Matthew Brown, D. D., Elisha McCurdy, John Brown, and David Limerick. The managers in behalf of the Presbyterian school of Washington were Messrs. Alexander Reed, Thomas M. T. McKennan, and John Wilson. Those for the Methodist school, the only other in town, were Messrs. Phillip Potter and James Ruple. The continuance and fruits of this association are beyond our knowledge.\n\nThe first two superintendents of the school were William C. Blair and James Williamson, both students in college. Then followed in succession Charles Hawkins, Peter De Haven, George Baird, Professor John W. Scott, Abner Leonard, Professor J. Holmes Agnew, William McCowles, John McClintock, Henry Williams, and James D. Mason. This brings us down to October 29,1838, when Dr. Robert R. Reed entered upon this charge with the trepidation so characteristic of his modest spirit, but with the fine intelligence, quick movement, genial manner, and Christian consecration which made him a centre of attraction and power alike to teachers and pupils through a service of twenty-six years. His activity ended with his sudden death Dec. 14, 1864, in the fifty-eighth year of his age,--an event followed with universal lamentation. The vacancy thus created was filled by the choice of James C. Acheson, another elder of the church, and for some time previous the assistant superintendent. After eighteen years of wise, kindly, and faithful service he still abides in strength, surrounded by an earnest band of co-workers, some of whom have come down with him through all these years.\n\nThe school has not been without the fluctuations incident to such work. But is has never failed to be a blessing of religious instruction and influence both to the children of the church and to very many beyond it. Better still is the fact that again and again, along the whole line of this progress, it has by divine grace been a birth-place of souls, not less than two hundred additions to the communion of the church having within the knowledge of the present writer come immediately from its classes. The infant department, organized in 1852, has continued with marked efficiency through the thirty intervening years, and now has an enrollment of one hundred Â“lambsÂ” to be fed under the direction of the Â“Good Shepherd.Â” The main school numbers two hundred and twenty-five in all. The number of officers and teachers is thirty. The average cost of conducting the school per annum has been $198.52 for the last ten years. For the same period the yearly average of missionary contributions has been $307.63. The enterprise has been a source of blessing for sixty-six years. Long may its streams flow on to make glad the city of our God.\n\nA fit conclusion of this imperfect sketch is our cordial brotherly recognition of the other churches of our town, devoted like ourselves to the extension of the RedeemerÂ’s kingdom. This is especially due to the Second Presbyterian Church, which, to meet a pressing need, was organized in 1864 from a nucleus of two elders, a deacon, and fifty-two private members, dismissed from our ranks for this purpose. Under the divine blessing it has risen to strength and efficiency. Its vigorous Sabbath-school is also a living stream which flow forth from our own. Let the mother and daughter thank God and take courage together in view of the fact that, in the aggregate membership of both, our Presbyterianism has nearly trebled its strength in Washington in the compass of a generation.\n\nSecond Presbyterian Church. [1Taken principally from an address by the Rev. George P. Hays, D. D.]--The origin of the movement which resulted in the existence of this church was mainly with Mr. C. M. Reed, aided by others who were at once both members of the First Church and intimately connected with the college. The plan was to call a pastor to the church and a professor to the college, and, by combining the salary derived from the two sources, raise a sum larger than either could alone. This suggestion met with hearty favor from those connected with the college, notably from Rev. J. W. Scott, D. C., who was then its president. Many conferences were had on the subject, and it finally culminated in a meeting of the First Church Dec 9, 1860, to consider means for securing enlarged church accommodations. A committee was appointed to report on the subject, and at another meeting on Dec. 27, 1860, a majority then reported as follows:\n\nÂ“Believing it to be our duty to furnish the means of hearing to all who may desire, or can be constrained to listen to the preaching of the divine message; that said accommodation is not furnished in our present church, and that any increase of sittings is impracticable and inexpedient, and that the size of our congregation justifies the recommendation of the formation of a new congregation as the only effectual remedy in this present exigency; therefore,\n\nÂ“Resolved., That in the opinion of this congregation the interests of religion would be promoted by the organization of a second Presbyterian congregation in Washington; and whenever any number of persons will signify their willingness to engage in a new church enterprise, this congregation will lend them all the aid, comfort, and encouragement in its power, and to that end do now appoint a committee to co-operate with them in the accomplishment of this object.Â”\n\nThis committee consisted of C. M. Reed, Thomas McKean, John Grayson, Jr., H. H. Clark, and W. B. Cundall. On the 3d of February, 1861, they met with the session of the First Church, and that session unanimously passed these resolutions commending the project:\n\nÂ“Resolved, That as the committee requested the session; if in accordance with their views, to designate two of their number of go off, and the session having learned that the two members desired by the persons favorable to the movement are Dr. John W. Wishart and H. H. Clark; therefore, if these brethren should feel themselves assured that such is their duty, whilst retaining unabated and unqualified confidence and Christian affection for them as brethren, and also expressing our sorrow at the thought of their separation from our number, yet we cannot withhold our consent, and will follow them with our prayers for the blessing of the Master upon themselves individually and upon the enterprise with which they are connected.\n\nÂ“Resolved, That we recommend to the members of the church and congregation, so far as they may severally feel enabled and inclined to lend this movement all the aid, comfort, and encouragement in their power.Â”\n\nWith this encouragement from the mother-church, those interested in the enterprise pushed it vigorously forward, until they were ready for organization by the Presbytery. Of this organization the following, from the minutes of Presbytery, is perhaps the best history:\n\nÂ“WASHINGTON, Pa., March 12, 1861.\n\nÂ“The Presbytery of Washington held a pro re nata meeting in the lecture-room of the Presbyterian Church of Washington, at 11 oÂ’clock A.M., pursuant to a call of the moderator upon the written request of two ministers and two elders, the latter being of different churches, and was opened with prayer.\n\nÂ“The following members were present, viz.: Messrs. John W. Scott, William P. Alrich, James W. McKennan, James I. Brownson, Alexander McCarrell, Williams B. Keeling, and N. B. Lyons, ministers, and Messrs. Joseph Henderson, John Hoon, and James Hughes, elders.\n\nÂ“The temporary clerk being absent, Mr. Keeling was appointed clerk pro tem. The moderator, Dr. Scott, stated the object of the meeting to be the organization of a second church in Washington, if the way be clear, and also the reception of the Rev. James Black, a professor in Washington College, as a member of Presbytery.\n\nÂ“The subject of the organization of a second church in Washington was now taken up. A memorial from sundry persons, members of the church and others, asking to be organized into a second church was read. Certificates of dismission of thirty-six members of the church of Washington and one from the church of Martinsville, Ohio were presented and read, and, being in order were approved. Dr. J. Wilson Wishart then appeared in behalf of the memorializes and made a full statement of the reasons which had induced the movement, all of which had grown solely out of the necessity for additional church accommodations. He bore decided testimony to the warm and unabated affection of all concerned for the pastor and other officers, as well as for the church itself. And he further presented and read the action of a meeting of the Washington congregation approving and recommending the movement by a vote of thirty nine to seven, and also the subsequent action of the session of the church acquiescing and concurring in the same. The pastor being called on approved the statement of Dr. Wishart as correct, and also fully reciprocated the kind expression of feeling for himself and the church which had been made, and further stated that whilst there had been some difference of opinion originally as to the expediency of this movement as compared with others suggested for the same end, there was now, since the decision of the question, no exception within his knowledge to the kindliest mutual good will and fraternal feeling without any suspicions of motives, and also an entire willingness to commit all the interests of the church in our midst to the future disposal of the Master himself.\n\nÂ“It was resolved unanimously that the prayer of the memorializes be granted.\n\nÂ“The persons whose certificates of dismission had been offered and approved then presented themselves, and, in response to the interrogation of the moderator, declared, by rising, their adherence to the doctrines and order of the Presbyterian Church, and their agreement and covenant together in a church relation.\n\nÂ“An election for officers was then held in the presence of the presbytery, the moderator presiding, when Dr. J. Wilson Wishart, Harvey H. Clark, John Grayson, Jr., and William B. Cundall were unanimously elected ruling elders, and David Aiken and William J. Matthews, deacons.\n\nÂ“Dr. Wishart and Mr. Clark having been elders in the mother-church and having now declared their acceptance of the same office in the new organization, were installed as such, the Rev. J. I. Brownson, at the request of the moderator, proposing the constitutional questions, and the Rev. J. W. McKennan leading the assembly in prayer. The ordination of the remaining elders and also the deacons and their installation were deferred to such a time as the church might appoint.\n\nÂ“It was then resolved that the church now organized be enrolled as the Second Church of Washington.\n\nÂ“The minutes were read and approved, and the presbytery adjourned, concluding with prayer.\n\nÂ“JAMES I. BROWNSON, Stated Clerk.Â”\n\nThe following is the certificate issued by the First Church to those going out to form the Second:\n\nMarch 12, 1861, the following-named persons were dismissed to join the Second Church of Washington: C. M. Reed, Sarah E. Reed, John Grayson, Jr., Mrs. Sarah E. Grayson, Harvey H. Clark, Mrs. Margaret L. Clark, William B. Cundall, Mrs. Emily C. Cundall, Nancy Jane Cundall, Dr. J. Wilson Wishart, Mrs. Sarah H. McGiffin, Mrs. Eleanor Donehoo, Mrs. Phebe H. Scott, Mary Scott, Kate Scott, Jennie Scott, Mrs. Julia A. Black, Martha G. Black, Mrs. Eliza J.

Pyle, Madeline Le Moyne, Jane Le Moyne, John Baird, Harriet S. Baird, James E. Smiley, Mrs. Hetty Smiley, Eliza Dare.\n\nJOSEPH HENDERSON, Clerk.\n\nThe church having thus been organized by Presbytery, a meeting was held in the lecture-room of the First Church that same evening to complete the organization by electing trustees, etc., of which meeting the following is the minute:\n\nÂ“At a meeting of the congregation of the Second Presbyterian Church of Washington, Pa., held in the lecture-room of the Presbyterian Church, in Washington, Pa., on Tuesday evening, March 12, 1861, Rev. J. W. Scott, D. C., was called to the chair, and W. J. Mathews elected secretary.\n\nÂ“The object of the meeting was stated to be to complete the organization of said congregation by adopting a constitution and electing officers to manage the temporal affairs of the congregation, and the transacting of such other business of the congregation as may be brought before this meeting.\n\nÂ“A constitution having been read and submitted, . . . On motion to proceed to nominate trustees, C. M. R"
