Wagner won his eighth (and final) batting title in 1911, a National League record that remains unbroken to this day, and matched only once, in 1997, by Tony Gwynn. He also led the league in slugging six times and stolen bases five times. Wagner was nicknamed \"the Flying Dutchman\" due to his superb speed and German heritage. This nickname was a nod to the popular folk-tale made into a famous opera by the German composer Richard Wagner. In 1936, the Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Wagner as one of the first five members. He received the second-highest vote total, behind Ty Cobb's 222 and tied with Babe Ruth at 215.\n\nBaseball players from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania · 56T\n\nBaseball players from Washington County, Pennsylvania · 14T\n\nPeople from Carnegie, Pennsylvania · 23T"
