        "text": "The so-called DC Madam who was convicted of running an escort service catering to the Washington elite said in suicide notes she could not bear to go to prison, and apologised to her mother and sister.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey, convicted last month of running an elite Washington prostitution ring, wrote to her mother that she could not \"live the next 6-8 years behind bars for what you and I have come to regard as this 'modern day lynching', only to come out of prison in my late '50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman\".\n\nThe notes were released by police today.\n\nPalfrey, 52, hanged herself with a nylon rope on Thursday in a shed outside her mother's mobile home in the Florida Gulf Coast community of Tarpon Springs, north-west of Tampa. Her mother, 76-year-old Blanche Palfrey, discovered the body.\n\nDeborah Palfrey was convicted of running a prostitution service that catered to members of Washington's political elite, including Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican. She denied her escort service engaged in prostitution, saying if any of the women engaged in sex acts for money, they did so without her knowledge.\n\nShe was free while she awaited sentencing on July 24 and had been staying with her mother.\n\nHer suicide appeared to have been planned for days. The note to her mother was dated April 25, nearly a week before she killed herself. Police said the notes were found on a night stand in the bedroom where she'd been staying. One of the notes said: \"Do not revive. Do not feed under any circumstances.\"\n\nIn the note to her younger sister, Bobbie, Palfrey expressed her love and told her to \"be strong for mom\".\n\n\"Also, you must comprehend that there was no other way out, i.e., 'exit strategy', other than the one I have chosen here,\" she wrote. \"Know I am at peace, with complete certainty, I believe Dad is standing watch - prepared to guide me into the light.\"\n\nAlso, police announced the medical examiner's office officially ruled Palfrey's death a suicide by hanging. A toxicology report is pending.\n\nA federal jury convicted Palfrey on April 15 of money laundering, using the mail for illegal purposes and racketeering. Prosecutors said she ran the prostitution service for 13 years. The trial concluded without revealing many new details about the service or its clients. Vitter was among possible witnesses but did not take the stand.\n\nPalfrey had vowed she would not go to prison, even telling a Washington writer that she would commit suicide first.\n\nAP"
