        "text": "On Wednesday, August 21, 2024, Township Manager Vernon Ashway welcomed Senator Mastriano for a comprehensive site tour, highlighting significant initiatives across the township. The tour focused on three critical projects for which the township has submitted state grant applications:\n\nAmsterdam Road Bridge Replacement: A project aimed at improving transportation safety and connectivity.\n\nMunicipal Complex Project – Phase 2: This phase involves the relocation of the township’s public works department to better serve the community’s needs.\n\nMonterey Pass Battlefield and Park Expansion: A vital effort to support the Friends of Monterey Pass in acquiring two additional properties, essential for enhancing programming and interpretation of the Battle of Monterey Pass.\n\nThe township extends its heartfelt gratitude to Senator Mastriano for his unwavering support and dedication to these vital infrastructure projects. His engagement and advocacy underscore the importance of these initiatives, which are crucial to our community’s growth and preservation. We are grateful for his partnership as we work to strengthen our township’s future, ensuring that these projects will benefit residents for generations to come. Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient community.\n\nBURN BAN IS IN EFFECT\n\nATTENTION WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP RESIDENTS:\n\nAll open burning is banned in Washington Township, Franklin County, Pennsylvania effective 12:00 p.m. Tuesday, June 25, 2024 as per Chapter 128, Code of the Township of Washington, Franklin County, Pennsylvania.\n\nWashington Township Board of Supervisors\n\nVernon Ashway\n\nTownship Manager\n\n“During periods when the open burning ban is in effect, no person shall start or maintain an open fire for any purpose without the approval of the Township.
