        "text": "The speculation began as soon as news broke that the woman known as the D.C. Madam had committed suicide.\n\nWhile Tarpon Springs police say the evidence shows Deborah Jeane Palfrey hanged herself Thursday in the shed behind her mother's Tarpon Springs home, that hasn't stopped people nationwide from speculating that she was murdered.\n\nThe prevailing theory: Palfrey was silenced to keep her from releasing the names of her escort service's high-profile, inside-the-Beltway clients.\n\nOn Friday, the conspiracy theory was gaining ground on blogs and postings by readers on mainstream media sites.\n\nMuch of it centers around comments Palfrey made during a March radio interview on The Alex Jones Show. When asked by the host if she was considering suicide, Palfrey replied:\n\n\"No, I'm not planning to commit suicide. I'm planning to go into court on April 7...and I plan on defending myself vigorously,\" she said.\n\nPalfrey was convicted April 15 of racketeering and money laundering while running a prostitution service. She was expected to receive about six years in prison when sentenced July 24.\n\nSome St. Petersburg Times readers posted comments on the newspaper's Web site, tampabay.com:\n\n\"Did she really kill herself?\" one post read. \"Looks like a set up to me.\"\n\nThe Pinellas-Pasco Medical Examiner's Office performed Palfrey's autopsy Friday, said Bill Pellan, director of investigations.\n\nPellan would not disclose any findings, and said toxicology results could take from 30 to 90 days. A final cause of death could be released much sooner, possibly within days.\n\nTarpon police Capt. Jeffrey Young said suicides are investigated as suspicious deaths, and each piece of evidence will be thoroughly reviewed before a final report is released, he said.\n\nBut Young reiterated there was no foul play."
