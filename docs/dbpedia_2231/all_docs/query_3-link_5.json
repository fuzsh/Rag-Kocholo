        "text": "Scott Glenn was born January 26, 1939, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Hope Elizabeth and Theodore Glenn, a salesman. As he grew up in Appalachia, his health was poor; he was bedridden for a year and doctors predicted he would limp for the rest of his life. During long periods of illness, Glenn was reading a lot and \"dreaming of becoming Lord Byron\". He challenged his illness by intense training programs and eventually got rid of his limp.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Glenn entered William and Mary College where he majored in English. He spent three years in the Marines and then tried to combine his passion for storytelling with his passion for adventures by working for five months as a criminal reporter at the Kenosha Evening News. Glenn planned to become an author but found out he had \"problems with dialogues\", so he decided to overcome it by studying acting. In 1966, he headed to New York where he joined George Morrison acting class. He helped in directing student plays to pay for his studies and appeared onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions. Soon after arriving in New York, Glenn became a fan of martial arts. In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theater and TV. In 1970, James Bridges offered him his first movie work in 100 Dollar mehr, wenn's ein Junge wird (1970).\n\nGlenn left for L.A., where he spent seven of the \"most miserable years of [his] life\". He couldn't find interesting film roles and, doing brief TV stints, he felt \"like a person who had to paint the Sistine Chapel with a house-painter's brush\". On a brighter side, he worked episodically with Jonathan Demme (Angels Hard as They Come (1971), Mach ein Kreuz und fahr zur Hölle (1976)), Robert Altman (Nashville (1975)) and Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now (1979)). In 1978, Glenn got tired of Hollywood and moved his family to Ketchum, Idaho, where he worked as a barman, huntsman and mountain ranger for two years (occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions). James Bridges once more changed the course of Glenn's life in 1980 when he offered him the role of John Travolta's rival in Urban Cowboy (1980) and made him a star. Glenn's acting abilities and physical presence helped him to excel both in action (Silverado (1985), Wenn er in die Hölle will, laß ihn gehen (1982)) and drama (Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), Countdown to Looking Glass (1984), Menschen am Fluss (1984)) as he alternately played good guys and bad guys.\n\nIn the beginning of the '90s, his career was at its peak - he appeared in such indisputable masterpieces as Das Schweigen der Lämmer (1991), and Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990). Established as one of Hollywood's most solid and respected character actors he has appeared in a wide variety of films, such as the black Freudian farce Wer hat Angst vorm Weihnachtsmann? (1995), the tragicomedy Edie & Pen (1996) and Ken Loach's socio-political declaration Carla's Song (1996), alternating mainstream (Mut zur Wahrheit (1996), Absolute Power (1997)) with independent projects (Lesser Prophets (1997) and Larga distancia (1997)), written by his daughter Dakota Glenn), and TV (Naked City - Ein Fest für einen Killer (1998)). Continuing into the 21st century, Glenn has also appeared in Training Day (2001), W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008) (as Donald Rumsfeld), Secretariat - Ein Pferd wird zur Legende (2010), Sucker Punch (2011), The Paperboy (2012), and two of the Bourne films: Das Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and Das Bourne Vermächtnis (2012).\n\nHandsome, rugged, versatile and charismatic character actor Tom Atkins was born on November 13, 1935 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Atkins initially became an avid horror film fan in his childhood days; Howard Hawks' immortal classic Das Ding aus einer anderen Welt (1951) made an especially strong impression on him as a kid. Tom attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and was a member of the Gamma Phi Fraternity. Atkins made his film debut as a rookie police officer in the Frank Sinatra private eye-outing Der Detektiv (1968); it was the first of many police officer roles he has played throughout the years. Tom appeared in two films for director John Carpenter: he is very likable as Nick Castle in the spooky ghost film The Fog: Nebel des Grauens (1980) and solid as Rehme in the fantastic futuristic sci-fi/action cult film Die Klapperschlange (1981). Atkins had a nice small role as a disapproving and overbearing father in the wrap-around segments of the immensely enjoyable fright feature anthology Die unheimlich verrückte Geisterstunde (1982). He made for a touchingly flawed hero as Dr. Daniel Challis in the unjustly maligned Halloween 3 - Die Nacht der Entscheidung (1982).\n\nTom gave a smack dead-on-the-money terrific performance as weary, cynical and suicidal Detective Ray Cameron in the delightful Die Nacht der Creeps (1986) (this movie is Tom's personal favorite among all the horror films he has acted in). He was once again excellent as the similarly burnt-out Lt. Frank McCrae in the fine Maniac Cop (1988) and impressive as the guilt-ridden heroin smuggler Michael Hunsaker in the exciting blockbuster Lethal Weapon - Zwei stahlharte Profis (1987). Atkins had a recurring part as Lt. Alex Diehl on the television series Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974); he reprised this character in several spin-off made-for-TV movies. Among the television series Tom has done guest spots on are Oz - Hölle hinter Gittern (1997), Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Der Equalizer (1985), Spenser (1985), Ein Colt für alle Fälle (1981), Lou Grant (1977), Baretta (1975) and M*A*S*H (1972). Outside of his film and television work, Atkins has had a long and distinguished stage career. He has acted on Broadway in the plays \"The Changing Room\" (Tom won a 1973 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer), \"Keep It in the Family\" and \"The Unknown Soldier and His Wife\". His off-Broadway credits include \"Vikings\", \"Long Days Journey Into Night\", \"Whistle in the Dark\" and \"Nobody Hears a Broken Drum\". Tom frequently acts in plays held at the Pittsburgh Public Theater; he has garnered plenty of accolades for his outstanding portrayal of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney in the acclaimed one-man show \"The Chief\". Tom Atkins resides in Peters Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania.\n\nSharon Stone was born and raised in Meadville, a small town in Pennsylvania. Her strict father was a factory worker, and her mother was a homemaker. She was the second of four children. At the age of 15, she studied in Saegertown High School, Pennsylvania, and at that same age, entered Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a degree in creative writing and fine arts. She was a very smart girl (with an IQ of 154), became a bookworm, and once was told that a suitable job for her (and her brains) was to become a lawyer. However, her first love was still the black-and-white movies, especially those featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. So, the 17-year-old Sharon got herself into the Miss Crawford County and won the beauty contest.\n\nFrom working part-time as a McDonald's counter girl, she worked her way up to become a successful Ford model, both in TV commercials and print ads. In 1980, she made her acting debut in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories (1980) as \"pretty girl in train\". Her first speaking part, though, was in Wes Craven's horror movie, Dem Tode geweiht (1981). She struggled through many parts in B-movies, notably Quatermain - Auf der Suche nach dem Schatz der Könige (1985) and Action Jackson (1988). She was also married in 1984 to Michael Greenburg, the producer of Macgyver (1985), but they divorced two years later.\n\nShe finally got her big break with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and also posed nude for Playboy, a daring move for a 32-year-old actress. But it worked; she landed the breakthrough role as a sociopath novelist, \"Catherine Tramell\", in Basic Instinct (1992). Her interrogation scene has become a classic in film history and her performance captivated everyone, from MTV viewers, who honored her with Most Desirable Female and Best Female Performance Awards, to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After she got famous, she didn't want to be typecast, so she played a victim in Sliver (1993), and, in Begegnungen (1994), she was the aloof, estranged wife of Richard Gere. These movies didn't \"work,\" so she got herself again into more aggressive roles , such as The Specialist (1994) with Sylvester Stallone and Schneller als der Tod (1995) with Gene Hackman.\n\nBut it wasn't until she played a beautiful but drug-crazy wife of Robert De Niro in Casino (1995) that she got far more than just fame and fortune--she also received the acknowledgment of the movie industry for her acting ability. She received her first Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She did a couple of films afterwards, teaming up with Isabelle Adjani in Diabolisch (1996), and as a woman waiting for her death penalty in Last Dance (1996). In 1998, she married a newspaper editor,Phil Bronstein but they divorced later in 2004. She received her third Golden Globe nomination for The Mighty - Gemeinsam sind sie stark (1998), a film that her company, \"Chaos\", also co-executive produced. The next year, she played the title role in Gloria (1999) and entered her first comedic role in Die Muse (1999), which gave her another Golden Globe nomination.\n\nSharon Stone, a diva who thoroughly enjoys her hard-won stardom, is now a mother of three children: Roan, Laird and Quinn.\n\nHe had the requisite charm and dark, thick-browed good-looks of a Tyrone Power that often spelled \"film stardom\" but it was not to be in the case of actor William Eythe. Spotted for Hollywood while performing on Broadway, he made nary a dent when he finally transferred his skills to film and is little remembered today. Outgoing in real life, he never found his full range in film and a certain staidness behind the charm and good looks prohibited him from standing out among the other high-ranking leading men. Like Power, his untimely death robbed film goers of seeing what kind of a character actor he might have made.\n\nBorn William John Joseph Eythe on April 7, 1918, in a small dairy town near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he was the son of a contractor. Developing an early interest in theatrics after appearing in an elementary school play, he put on his own shows as an amateur producer/director. Following high school he applied to the School of Drama at Carnegie Tech where he initially focused on set design and costuming due to a stammering problem (it was corrected while there). He also produced some of the school's musicals in which he also wrote the songs. Graduating from college in 1941, he began leaning towards a professional music theater and started involving himself in musicals and revues in the Pittsburgh era. He appeared in various stock shows in other states as well, including the \"borscht circuit\", while radio work in the form of announcing came his way. Following a failed attempt at forming his own stock company, he was discovered by a 20th Century-Fox talent scout while performing impressively on Broadway in \"The Moon Is Down\" and moved west when the show closed in the summer of '42.\n\nBenefiting from the fact that many major Hollywood male stars were actively serving in WWII, Eythe. who had \"4-F status, was handed an enviable film debut as the wavering son of a lynch mob member in the superb Ritt zum Ox-Bow (1942). More quality films ensued with Das Lied von Bernadette (1943) and Wilson (1944) although he didn't have much of a chance to shine. He received his best Hollywood top-lining assignments as the rural WWII soldier who has telepathic capabilities in The Eve of St. Mark (1944) and as a German-American double agent in the taut espionage drama Das Haus in der 92. Straße (1945). When Fox star Tyrone Power turned down the lead role opposite Tallulah Bankhead in the plush costumer Skandal bei Hofe (1945), Eythe inherited the part. Naturally Tallulah's histrionics dominated the proceedings and Eythe, though sincere and quite photogenic, was completely overlooked. This happened in other movies as well, and while he was a talented singer/dancer, the only musical film he ever appeared in required minor singing in Centennial Summer (1946). Adding insult to injury, he was dubbed.\n\nEythe never conformed easily to the strictest of rules that studio head Darryl F. Zanuck imposed and it proved a detriment to his career in the long run. He was either suspended or (in one case) farmed out to England to do a \"B\" film as punishment for his rebellious nature. A close \"friendship\" with fellow actor Lon McCallister had to be carefully dampened, and, out of concern, an impulsive marriage in 1947 to socialite and Fox starlet Buff Cobb was the result. It may have ended rumors for a spell but, not unsurprisingly, the couple divorced a little over a year later. Ms. Cobb later married veteran TV newsman Mike Wallace.\n\nIn the post-war years, Fox began to lose interest and Eythe was seen with less frequency. He flatlined film-wise in his last two \"C\" movies that were made by other studios: Special Agent (1949) and Customs Agent (1950). To compensate for the waning of interest, he formed his own production company and appeared on stage in such fare as \"The Glass Menagerie\" in the showy role of son Tom. He also enjoyed seeing one of his early revues, \"Lend an Ear\", revamped by Charles Gaynor and given a Broadway run in 1948. Eythe was one of the show's producers and singing stars. The musical is best remembered for putting co-star Carol Channing on the map. In addition, Eythe replaced baritone Alfred Drake in \"The Liar\" a couple of years later. In 1956 he and McCallister, along with Huntington Hartford, produced a musical revue with the hopes of it reaching Broadway but it closed in Chicago. Uninspired TV work did little to alter his decline.\n\nDepression eventually set in and he turned heavily to drink with an unfortunate series of tabloid-making arrests resulting. His health in rapid deterioration, he was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital one day for treatment of acute hepatitis and died ten days later, at age 38, on January 26, 1957. For someone so promising, his untimely death merely left another tainted impression of the downside to Hollywood stardom.\n\nIn a singing (and sometimes acting) career that spanned over six decades, the name Perry Como has come to mean that warm, smooth, easy-listening, general-audience, slow-flame romance that characterized popular music in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. It has also come to represent an overall good feeling. Telling of the success of the appeal of that good feeling early on in his career, during just a single week in the 1940s, the music industry pressed and sold 4 million Como records. In the 1950s, 11 of his singles sold well over 1 million copies each. In more than six decades of singing, his records sold more than 100 million copies; 27 individual prints reached the million-record mark.\n\nChristened Pierino Como in Canonsburg, Pa., and one of a family of 13 children, Como pursued a career as a barber before he launched his singing career. At 11, he was working after school cutting hair in a barbershop. Before long he had set his sights on owning his own shop -- even making monthly payments toward one. He enjoyed singing, however, and let go of his barbershop ambitions soon after high school and his marriage to his high school sweetheart, Roselle Beline. It didn't take long to prove that he had talent and soon landed a spot in the Freddie Carlone Orchestra, where he made $28 a week touring the Midwest. In 1937, he joined the Ted Weems orchestra and was featured on the band's \"Beat the Band\" radio program. His career was on the rise. But, with the start of WWII and the eventual breakup of Weems' band, Como found himself back in Canonsburg in a barbershop cutting hair -- not for long, however. CBS radio soon offered him a weekly show at $100 a week and RCA signed him to a recording contract that garnered him in the next 14 years 42 Top 10 hits, a feat bettered only by Bing Crosby. These hits included \"Dig You Later (A Hubba-Hubba-Hubba),\" \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,\" \"They Say It's Wonderful,\" \"Surrender\" and \"Some Enchanted Evening.\" The 1945 rendition of \"Till the End of Time,\" (a song associated with the movie \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" and based on Chopin's \"Polonaise in A-Flat Minor\") was perhaps his most memorable hit from this era. Other hits were on the lighter side of romance and included \"Hot Diggity\" and the forever a favorite \"Papa Loves Mambo.\"\n\nIt was also during his singing career in the 1940s that Como appeared in three films for Twentieth Century Fox. His parts were unfortunately less than memorable, partly because of his overpowering screen presence of his co-star Carmen Miranda. But Como did have a screen presence, and he found its niche in the magic of the living room theater when he made his television debut in 1948 with NBC's \"The Chesterfield Supper Club.\" In 1950, he was at the helm of his own show with CBS: \"The Perry Como Show,\" which ran for five years. Back on NBC in 1955 he achieved his greatest success in the medium with an eight-year run. This was the show that featured his theme song: \"Sing Along With Me.\" The show included the talents of the Ray Charles Singers and announcer Frank Gallop. It was also in this show where he developed and honed the image of the cardigan-wearing, relaxed, wholesome nice-guy that has been his trademark ever since. In 1956 and '57 he won Emmy Awards for most outstanding television personality. The show itself won Peabody and Golden Mike awards. During his tenure with this show he also received the Recording Industry Association of America's first ever Gold Disc Award for his rendition of \"Catch a Falling Star.\" He retired from his show in 1963, opting to work only occasionally on t.v. specials. These specials included his traditional Christmas shows. After two decades of just canned music, he returned to live performances in the 1970s, playing Las Vegas and other circuits; he even did a sell-out tour of Australia. The 1970s also gave rise to his million record seller \"It's Impossible.\" In one of his most gratifying moments in his career, President Reagan presented Como with a Kennedy Center award for outstanding achievement in the performing arts.\n\nEugene Curran Kelly was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the third son of Harriet Catherine (Curran) and James Patrick Joseph Kelly, a phonograph salesman. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of Irish and German ancestry.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was For Me and My Gal (1942) with Judy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw Ein Amerikaner in Paris (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by George Gershwin and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Du sollst mein Glücksstern sein (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as Fred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style.\n\nGene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor F. Murray Abraham was born on October 24, 1939 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in El Paso, Texas. His father, Fred Abraham, was a Syrian (Antiochian Orthodox Christian) immigrant. His mother, Josephine (Stello) Abraham, was the daughter of Italian immigrants. Born with the first name \"Murray\", he added an \"F.\" to distinguish his stage name.\n\nPrimarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in George C. Scott's comedy Der verkehrte Sherlock Holmes (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Einsatz in Manhattan (1973). His film work of those years also included the roles of a cabdriver in Das Nervenbündel (1975), a mechanic in Die Sunny-Boys (1975), and a police officer in Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976).\n\nBeyond these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had\". His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear.\n\nIn 1985, he was honored with as Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the acclaimed role of envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He was also honored with a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, among other awards, and his role in the film, is still considered to be his most iconic as the film's director Milos Forman inspired the work of the role with Abraham's wide range of qualities as a great stage and film actor.\n\nAfter Amadeus, he next appeared in Der Name der Rose (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sir Sean Connery as William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he also explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release.\n\nFrank John Gorshin, Jr. was born on April 5, 1933 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father was a railroad worker and his mother, Frances (Preseren), was a seamstress. His family was originally from Novo Mesto, Slovenia. While in high school, young Frank worked as an usher at the Sheridan Square Theatre and began doing impressions of some of his screen idols: Al Jolson, James Cagney, Cary Grant and Edward G. Robinson. At age 17, he won a local talent contest. The prize was a one-week engagement at Jackie Heller's Carousel nightclub, where Alan King was headlining. It was young Frank's first paid job as an entertainer and launched his show business career. Frank attended local Catholic schools and, later, Carnegie-Mellon Tech School of Drama. He acted in plays and performed in nightclubs in Pittsburgh in his spare time.\n\nIn 1953, at age 19, he was drafted into the United States Army and was posted in Germany. Frank served for two years, 1953-1955, as an entertainer attached to Special Services. In the Army, Frank met Maurice A. Bergman, who would introduce Frank to a Hollywood agent when his hitch with Uncle Sam was up. Frank quickly landed a role in Auch Helden können weinen (1956) and other roles in television dramas followed.\n\nIn 1957, while visiting his family in Pittsburgh, his agent phoned him to rush back to Hollywood for an audition for U 23 - Tödliche Tiefen (1958). For some odd reason, instead of catching a plane, Frank decided to drive his car to Los Angeles. Driving 39 consecutive hours, he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed, suffered a fractured skull and woke up in the hospital four days later. To add insult to injury, a Los Angeles newspaper reported he was killed, and the plum movie role of Officer Ruby went to Don Rickles.\n\nFrank appeared in a number of lovable B-movies for American-International Pictures: Hot Rod Girl (1956) and Dragstrip Girl (1957), and everybody's favorite, Invasion of the Saucer Men (1957). Frank finally got a substantial role in the A-movie, Anruf genügt - komme ins Haus (1960), with Dean Martin and Judy Holliday. He did a thinly-disguised Marlon Brando impression. he also appeared in Hollywood nightclubs, including the Purple Onion. He did Las Vegas engagements, opening for Bobby Darin at The Flamingo. On television, Frank appeared on The Steve Allen Show (1956) and had a dozen guest shots on Toast of the Town (1948).\n\nIn 1966, he gave his breakout performance, performing what has become his best-known role: The Riddler on Batman (1966), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also played The Riddler in the movie, Batman hält die Welt in Atem (1966), based on the television series. \"I could feel the impact overnight\", he recalled later. Because of his nationwide recognition, he was given headliner status in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand, Sahara and Aladdin Hotels. He received more good reviews for his performance in Let That Be Your Last Battlefield (1969).\n\nIn 1970, Frank made his Broadway debut as the star of \"Jimmy\", for which he got rave reviews. He also starred in many touring company productions, such as \"Promises, Promises\", \"Peter Pan\", \"Prisoner of Second Street\" and \"Guys and Dolls\". In the 1980s, Frank served as Honorary Chairman, Entertainment Division, for the American Heart Association. Perhaps recalling his early AIP films, Frank worked with the legendary Roger Corman, appearing as Clockwise on the television series Black Scorpion (2001) and on Corman's The Phantom Eye (1999). He had appeared in over 70 movies and made over 40 guest appearances in television series.\n\nGorshin died at age 72 in Burbank, California on May 17, 2005. He had suffered from lung cancer, emphysema and pneumonia.\n\nActor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini was born in Pittsburgh. Inspired by the film Der Mann mit den 1000 Gesichtern (1957), a young Savini became fascinated with the magic and illusion of film. He spent his youth in his room creating characters by tirelessly practicing make-up. Later, as a combat photographer in Vietnam, Savini saw first-hand the gruesome carnage for which he later gained fame, simulating it on screen.\n\nHe has acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the \"splatter movie\" explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends Dick Smith and Rob Bottin, Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up & EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor Lon Chaney, and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book \"Grande Illusions\", he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using \"spearmint gum\", having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use \"spirit gum\"! His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as Besessen (1974) and Martin (1977).\n\nHe really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult George A. Romero-directed zombie film Zombie (1978), and then in the controversial slasher film Freitag, der 13. (1980), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned \"splatter movie\" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX & make-up to other splatter thrillers such as Maniac (1980), Brennende Rache (1981), Die unheimlich verrückte Geisterstunde (1982) and Romero's third \"Dead\" film, Zombie 2 - Das letzte Kapitel (1985) (for which he won a Saturn Award). In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut Die Rückkehr der Untoten - Night of the Living Dead (1990), the remake of the original zombie-classic.\n\nNot content with only being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as \"Morgan, the Black Knight\" in Ritter auf heißen Öfen (1981), as \"Blades\", one of the biker gang members in Zombie (1978) and as \"Sex Machine\", another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).\n\nA marvelously quirky and distinctive 4' 3\" character actress, with a larger-than-life presence on film and TV, Zelda Rubinstein gave up a long and stable career in the medical field as a lab technician in order to strive for something more self-fulfilling as middle age settled in. At the age of 45, the feisty lady gave up the comfort of a stable paycheck and attempt an acting career, a daunting task for anyone but especially someone of her stature and type. Within a few years, she had beaten the odds and became a major movie celebrity thanks to one terrific showcase in a Steven Spielberg horror classic. In the process, she served as an inspiration to all the \"little people\" working in Hollywood who are forced to toil in cruel and demeaning stereotypes.\n\nZelda May Rubinstein was born on May 28, 1933 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Dolores and George Rubinstein, who were Polish Jewish immigrants. Zelda was the youngest of three children, and the only \"little person\" in the family. Her childhood and teenage years were decidedly difficult in terms of coping with her \"interesting variation,\" which was caused by a pituitary gland deficiency. With no designs on acting at the time, she went the normal route of college and received a scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh. She earned her degree in bacteriology and worked for a number of years as a lab technician in blood banks. In 1978, Zelda, in a pursuit of something more creative in her life, abandoned her cushy but mundane job and threw herself completely into acting. She made her movie debut as one of the little people in the Chevy Chase slapstick comedy Geheimauftrag Hollywood (1981). It all came together so quickly with her second film Poltergeist (1982) in the scene-stealing role of Tangina, the saucy, self-confident, prune-faced \"house cleaner\" with the whispery, doll-like voice who is brought in to rid a suburban home of demonic possession. Co-writer/producer Spielberg claims he designed the psychic role specifically for a \"little person\". The film became an instant summertime hit and Zelda created absolute magic and wonderment with the testy role, receiving some of the movie's best reviews. The character actress went on to appear in the two \"Poltergeist\" sequels. The \"Poltergeist\" movie projects were eventually dubbed \"cursed\" due to the untimely deaths of some of its performers, particularly two of the three children of film parents Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams. 22-year-old Dominique Dunne was slain in 1982 by a jealous ex-boyfriend only a few months after the first film's release, and angelic little Heather O'Rourke, age 12, died of an intestinal obstruction just months before Poltergeist III - Die dunkle Seite des Bösen (1988) made it to the screen.\n\nAlthough Zelda would not find a role quite up to the standards and popularity of Tangina, her subsequent career remained surprisingly active with a number of weird parts woven into both comedies and chillers -- often variations of her eccentric Tangina role. She played a mental patient in the Frances Farmer biopic Frances (1982), which showcased Jessica Lange in the Oscar-nominated title role; a squeaky-shoed organist in John Hughes sweet-sixteen comedy classic Das darf man nur als Erwachsener (1984) co-starring Brat Packers Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall; the demented mom in the gruesome, Spanish-made horror-thriller Im Augenblick der Angst (1987) [aka Anguish], which has since reached cult status; a mentor witch in the comic fantasy Teen Witch (1989); a hermit in a National Lampoon-based slapstick Sam und Dave - Zwei Ballermänner auf Tauchstation (1994); a betting clerk in the Sci-Fi adventure Timemaster - Aus der Zukunft zurück (1995); an ill-fated nun in the thriller Last Scream - Wächter des Teufels (1996), and; a theatre director in the flick Critics and Other Freaks (1997).\n\nInto the millennium, she made some odd, slapdash appearances in such minor fare as Maria & Jose (2000), Wishcraft (2002), Cages (2005), Angels with Angles (2005), Unbeatable Harold (2006) and Southland Tales (2006). In her last film, she furthered her horror icon status with a small cameo in the slim-budgeted indie Behind the Mask (2006) that also featured Robert Englund of \"Freddy Krueger\" fame. Zelda also found an \"in\" doing voiceovers, her doll-like tones ideal for cartoons and such, and in commercials promoting such items as Skittles candy. She enjoyed extended popularity on TV with a regular series role on the first couple of seasons of Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992). Her character later was killed off in a freakish accident (fell into a freezer!). In her last years she narrated, and \"Exorcist\" child star Linda Blair hosted, TV's Scariest Places on Earth (2000). The actress also appeared on stage in such productions as \"Deathtrap\" (as a psychic, of course), \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" \"Suddenly, Last Summer,\" \"The Slab Boys\" and \"Black Comedy\". She also appeared as Yente in a production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nAn outspoken social activist, Zelda was a staunch advocate for the rights of little people who formed the nonprofit Michael Dunn Memorial Repertory Theater Company in Los Angeles in 1985. The actress gained additional attention and respect, if not popularity (her career suffered for a time as a result), as an early and outspoken HIV/AIDS activist. As the poster mom for AIDS awareness, she valiantly appeared in a series of maternal newspaper/billboard advertisements imploring her gay son to practice safe sex. The series of ads ran from the mid-to-late 1980s. Zelda also participated in the first AIDS Project Los Angeles AIDS Walk and attended the 25th Anniversary Walk on October 12, 2009.\n\nA couple of months before her death on January 27, 2010, Zelda suffered a heart attack. Complications set in (kidney and lung failure) and she passed away at age 76 on January 27, 2010, at Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDeadpan comedian Charles Sidney Grodin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania of Russian/Polish ancestry and raised in a Jewish orthodox home. He attended the University of Miami but dropped out, opting instead for the life of a struggling actor. The movie Ein Platz an der Sonne (1951) was said to have steered him towards his chosen profession. In his own words: \"It was two things. One is I think I developed an overwhelming crush on Elizabeth Taylor. And two, Montgomery Clift made acting look like 'Gee, well that looks pretty easy - just a guy talking.'\".\n\nAfter a spell with Uta Hagen (1956-59), he attended Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio before making his stage debut on Broadway in 1962. Though he appeared on screen from as early as 1954, Grodin did not make a great deal of headway in this medium until he attracted critical notice playing the small but crucial role of obstetrician Dr. C.C. Hill in Rosemaries Baby (1968). More substantial roles soon followed. His first major starring turn was in Pferdewechsel in der Hochzeitsnacht (1972), a black comedy written by Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. Grodin managed to inject charm and humanity in what was essentially an egotistical central character. Film reviewer Roger Ebert praised his performance, describing the actor as a \"kind of Dustin Hoffman-as-overachiever\", an opinion which was echoed by Vincent Canby of the New York Times. Ironically, Grodin had earlier turned down the pivotal role in Die Reifeprüfung (1967) which propelled Hoffman to stardom (he also -- probably unwisely -- spurned the role of oceanographer Matt Hooper in Der weiße Hai (1975) which instead went to Richard Dreyfuss).\n\nGrodin's ultimate breakthrough came on the Broadway stage in \"Same Time Next Year\" (1975) (opposite Ellen Burstyn), a hugely successful romantic comedy about two people, each married to someone else, who conduct an extramarital affair for a single day over the course of 24 years in the same room of a northern Californian inn. Though the two leads left the show after seven months, Grodin was now much sought-after in Hollywood as a droll comic actor and cast in a string of hit comedies: Der Himmel soll warten (1978), Fast wie in alten Zeiten (1980), Ein Single Kommt Selten Allein (1984) and Midnight Run - 5 Tage bis Mitternacht (1988). He also appeared to sterling effect in the underrated farce Der Couch-Trip (1988), in which he co-starred with Walter Matthau and Dan Aykroyd as the brittle psychiatrist and radio host Dr. George Maitlin. Arguably his most popular box office success was opposite the titular Saint Bernard canine in the family-oriented comedy Ein Hund namens Beethoven (1992). Despite less than enthusiastic critical reviews, the film was a hit with audiences, grossed $147.2 million worldwide and spawned a sequel.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Grodin reinvented himself as a television host (Charles Grodin (1995)) and political commentator. He made frequent guest appearances on talk shows with Carson or Letterman, typically adopting the persona of a belligerent tongue-in-cheek character to facilitate \"comically uncomfortable situations on the set\". Grodin was also a prolific author, both of fiction and non-fiction. An autobiography was entitled \"It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business\" (1989). Charles Grodin died at age 86 of bone marrow cancer on May 18, 2021 at his home in Wilton, Connecticut.\n\nThey don't come any nicer than John Davidson. The dark-haired, Pittsburgh-born singer/TV personality, who was born in 1941 and the son of a Baptist minister, is highly-defined and sometimes cursed by his clean-cut, fresh-faced, apple-cheeked handsomeness. After graduating from high school in White Plains, New York, and earning a B.A. in Theater Arts from Denison University, John took his naturally-gifted baritone voice to the musical stage. The affable six-footer made his Broadway bow with Bert Lahr and Larry Blyden in the short-lived musical, \"Foxy\", in 1964 at the Ziegfeld Theater. TV producer Bob Banner, who discovered such other formidable talents as Carol Burnett, Dom DeLuise and Bob Newhart, caught John in one of his performances and immediately took him under his wing.\n\nWithin a short time, John was moving quickly in the musical fast lane. On TV, he co-starred as \"Matt\" in a 1964 Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of the classic musical, \"The Fantasticks\", alongside an esteemed company that included Mr. Lahr, Ricardo Montalban, Stanley Holloway and the lovely soprano, Susan Watson. He also appeared as a regular on The Entertainers (1964), and grew in stature enough to host The Kraft Summer Music Hall (1966), keeping his face and voice consistently front-and-center on the prime-time variety show circuit. Back on stage, he won a Theater World Award in 1965 for his role as \"Curly\" in \"Oklahoma!\", a part he would play many times over the years. Demonstrating leading man potential, John was handed tuneful co-star assignments in the rather antiseptic Disney movies, Der glücklichste Millionär (1967) and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968), both featuring the reigning \"Cinderella\" of the time, Lesley Ann Warren, but he did not move ahead in films.\n\nWhile an overly cute, lightweight image severely hampered his chances to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor, the bedimpled performer, nevertheless, made great strides as a full-fledged TV presence in the 1970s. He earned his own daytime talk show, The John Davidson Show (1969), and appeared in such mini-movie offerings as Hilfe, ich habe zwei Ehemänner (1973) with Karen Valentine. He co-starred with another eternal cutie at the time, Sally Field, in Meiner Frau bleibt nichts verborgen (1973), playing newlyweds, but the sitcom was unsuccessful. Through the lean years, John maintained by singing on his own TV Christmas specials and guesting in episodes of Love Boat (1977) and Fantasy Island (1977). Interest in John, however, slacked off.\n\nIt wasn't until the next decade when his career revitalized by hosting That's Incredible! (1980). The show's format fit John's buoyant nature to a tee and lasted four years, alongside co-host Cathy Lee Crosby. His talent for self-effacing \"straight man\" humor showed up first as a The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965) regular, then as takeover host of The New Hollywood Squares (1986), which lasted several years. He also took over Dick Clark's emcee post on the syndicated game show, The $10,000 Pyramid (1973), during the 1992-1993 season.\n\nMusic, however, has always been John's first passion. In addition to recording 12 solo albums in both the pop and country music venues, he plays the guitar and banjo and has sung in English, French and Spanish. A perennial nightclub and concert favorite, he has starred in many national tours and stock productions including \"The Music Man\", \"110 in the Shade\", \"Paint Your Wagon\", \"Li'l Abner\", \"Camelot\", \"Carousel\", \"I Do! I Do!\" and \"Will Rogers' Follies\", among others. He's appeared in legit plays, including the off-Broadway comedy, \"High Infidelity\", opposite both Barbara Eden and Morgan Fairchild, and, in 1996, returned to Broadway, after 32 years, in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, \"State Fair\". Two years later, he was inspired to try out his one-man show, \"Bully\", as Theodore Roosevelt, after playing the president earlier in the musical, \"Teddy and Alice\". John has made sporadic appearances in films, including the disaster epic, Airport 1980 - Die Concorde (1979), and Edward mit den Scherenhänden (1990).\n\nDivorced in 1982 from singer Jackie Miller, who once was part of the folk duo, Jackie and Gayle, after 13 years of marriage and two children, John is currently with second wife and former backup singer, Rhonda Davidson (nee Rivera) (since 1983). Together, they have a child of their own, Ashleigh Davidson. Most recently, he appeared with one of his children, Ashleigh, in a 2005 musical production of \"Shenandoah\"."
