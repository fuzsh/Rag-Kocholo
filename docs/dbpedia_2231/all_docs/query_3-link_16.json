She is descended on the paternal side from English and Dutch families that settled in Virginia in 16oo, and on the maternal side from Col. George Morgan, who had charge of Indian affairs under Washington, with headquarters at Fort Pitt, and of whom Jefferson, in a letter which Mrs. Acheson has in her possession, says, \"He first gave me notice of the mad project of that day,\" meaning the Aaron Burr treason. Among her ancestors were Col. William Duane, of Philadelphia, editor of the Philadelphia \"Aurora\" during the Revolution. Her girlhood was spent in the town of her birth, where she was married, in 1863, to Capt. Acheson, of the same place, then on Gen. Miles's staff, the marriage taking place while the Captain was on furlough with a gunshot wound in the face. He left for the front ten days after, encouraged by his young wife. Dr and Mrs. Acheson moved to Texas in 1872. During their residence in Texas Mrs. Acheson has been a moral force. Her influence has been strongly felt, not only in the city where she resides, but throughout the State. Her generous nature has been shown in heroic deeds of a kind which the world seldom sees. When a cyclone struck the village of Savoy, many of its inhabitants were badly wounded, some were killed, others made homeless. Mrs. Acheson reached them as speedily as a train could take her, doing duty as nurse and special provider for the suffering. She gave three years of active service to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was State president at a time when a strong leader was greatly needed, guiding their bark into a haven of financial safety. Her life is active along all lines of duty. She is abreast of the advanced thought of the age. The world's progress in social, scientific and religious reform is not only an open, but a well read book, to her. Her home is in Denison, Tex.\n\n(American Women, Fifteen Hundred Biographies, Vol 1, Publ. 1897.

JOHN S. MARQUIS, D. D., The family of which this gentleman is a worthy representative is one of the oldest of Cross Creek township. They are descendants of French Huguenots, who fled from France on account of religious persecutions, and settled in Ireland.\n\nIn 1720 William Marquis and Margaret, his wife, together with their son Thomas and daughter Mary, emigrated to this country from Ireland, and settled in Frederick county, VA., near to Winchester. It is believed that some of the children of this family remained in Ireland. Some years after their parents came to America, Thomas Marquis married Miss Mary Colville, and Mary Marquis, married John Wilson, and died shortly after. Thomas was the father of seven children-four sons and three daughters-named as follows: William, James, John, Thomas, Elizabeth, Sarah and Anne. Thomas Marquis, the father of these children, was killed by the falling of a limb of a tree, whilst gathering corn. His children were brought up under the direction of his brother-in-law, John Wilson, who was a school teacher, and a religious man, consequently they were carefully educated, both secularly and religiously.\n\nWilliam Marquis, son of Thomas, married Miss Elizabeth Vance, and reared a large family, most of whom came to this county, but afterward moved to Ohio. Hon. William Vance Marquis, ex-lieutenant governor of Ohio, is a great-grandson. James Marquis married Miss Mary Vance, a sister of the wife of his brother William, and his family, which was large, came to this county, but afterward went to Ohio. John Marquis, the third son of this family, was the first of the name to settle in this county, and was one of the first settles of Cross Creek township. He was born June 10, 1750, and married Miss Sarah Griffith, of Frederick county, Va. He settled, in 1774 on a tract of land for which he obtained a warrant February 23, 1786, and afterward received a patent. This tract was called \"Marquesata,\" and contained 421 acres, and allowance, embracing the farms now owned by H. C. Anderson and Robert Anderson, and a part of the farm of Richard Wells, called the \"Mason\" farm. For some time, on account of the Indian raids, he was obliged to keep his family in Vance's fort, while he tried to clear his farm. Once, while in his cabin, he heard the report of a rifle close at hand, and going out he saw a party of Indians killing his hogs. On seeing him they immediately gave the war whoop and rushed down upon him. It was a race for life, and although the Indians were so close to him at the start that he heard their footsteps in pursuit, yet he outran them and arrived in safety at Vance's fort. He was noted among the scouts and backwoodsmen as a fleet runner, and he was a man of strong and decided character; for many years was an elder of the Presbyterian Church of Cross Creek. He died February 25, 1822. He raised a family of nine children-six sons and three daughters, viz.: Thomas, John, Mary, Sarah, Edward, Robert, James, Anne and William, of whom Thomas married Nancy Marquis, his cousin, and they had a large family: John married Elizabeth Taggart, and they spent their days on a farm in Jefferson township, now owned by their son James T. Marquis (Rev. John A. Marquis, pastor of a Presbyterian Church at Greensburg, Westmoreland Co., Penn., is a grandson, and Mrs. Rev. J. B. Lyle, of Scottdale, is a granddaughter); Mary Marquis married Hon. Joshua Robb, who was for many years an associate judge of the courts in Logan county, Ohio, and he represented that county in the State Legislature for several terms (Hon. Judge T. M. Robb, of Lima, Allen Co., Ohio, and Hon. Vance Robb, of the same county, also Hon. James Smith Robb, M. D., of Logan county, Ohio, were their sons); Sarah Marquis married John Nelson, and lived near Bellefontaine, Logan Co., Ohio (they had a family of eleven children); Edward Marquis was twice married, first to Margaret Marquis, and then to Elizabeth Newell (he had several children; his home was near Mt. Vernon, Knox Co., Ohio); Robert Marquis was also twice married, first to Hannah Van Nordstrand, and afterward to Mary Stevenson (his children, all of the second marriage, were Newton, Rev. John S., Miles and Robert, of whom Newton married Mary Patterson, daughter of Hon. William Patterson, and granddaughter of Gen. Thomas Patterson of Cross Cree; he died when a young man); Rev. John S. Marquis, D. D. , married Margaretta Bryant McConaughy (he was for seventeen years pastor of Pigeon Creek Presbyterian Church in this county; his home is now in Washington, and he has supplied the church of Lower Ten Mile at Amity, Penn., for nearly seven years). (Prof. J. S. Marquis, principal of Brainerd Institute, Chester, S. C. and Hugh McConaughy Marquis, S. K. of the B. & O. R. R. Works at Glenwood, Penn., are grandsons of Robert and Mary (Stevenson) Marquis); Miles Marquis died young; Robert Marquis was twice married, first to Jane Patterson, daughter of James Patterson, and his second wife was Elizabeth Scott (they now reside in Caldwell county, Mo., and have a family of seven children-four sons and three daughters).\n\nJames Marquis, fifth son of the pioneer John, married first Nancy Roberts and afterward Nancy Elliott (he died in Knox County, Ohio; Mrs. Rev. N. C. Helfrich, of Plymouth, Ohio, is his daughter); William Marquis (sixth son of John) married Elizabeth Adams, and lived near Tiffin, Seneca Co., Ohio (Mrs. Rev. Solomon Cook of that county is his daughter); Anne Marquis (third daughter of John) married Isaac Morrison, and they lived near Bellefontaine, Ohio. The children of John and Sarah (Griffith) Marquis were noted for their musical talents and fine musical voices. Dr. John Stockton told the writer, that Robert Marquis had the finest musical voice of any man he ever heard sing.\n\nJohn Marquis and his brother Thomas (afterward Rev. Thomas Marquis), in company with some others, pursued a band of Indians, which had made a raid into that neighborhood, in 1776, murdered one woman and took captive another woman (Reynolds) and a child. They came upon the Indians just at daybreak, as they were making a raft to cross the Ohio river opposite where is now Mingo Junction, on the Pan Handle Railroad. Seven of the eight Indians were killed, and one man of the pursuing party. The families of James T. Marquis and of Rev. J. S. Marquis, D. D., are the only descendants of John and Sarah Marquis now residing in this county.\n\nRev. Thomas Marquis, the fourth son of Thomas and Mary (Colville) Marquis, was born in Opequan Valley, Va., in 1753; was married March 5, 1776, to Jane Park, and some time after came to Washington county. He settled on a tract of land for which he took out a warrant February 23, 1786, and afterward obtained a patent. This tract was called \"Marrigate\" and contained 417 acres, and allowance. The tract embraces one of the farms now owned by Richard Wells, the farm of the Bebout heirs, and a part of the Perrine tract. Afterward, by deed dated August 27, 1794, he purchased from Alexander Wells, of Cross Creek, and Nathan Cromwell, of Baltimore, a tract of 500 acres, embracing lands now owned by Hon. J. S. Duncan, John Lee, a tract (called the \"McConnell\" farm) now owned by W. C. Lee, and a part of the farm of Rev. J. S. Marquis, D. D. His family was obliged to live for a time in Vance's fort, owing to the incursions of the Indians, and while there he was converted under the preaching of Rev. James Power, D. D. By the advice of, Revs. Smith and Dodd he commenced preparation for the ministry. His classical education was obtained at Canonsburg Academy, and he studied theology under the direction of Rev. Dr. McMillan and Rev. Joseph Smith; was licensed to preach the Gospel by the Presbytery of Redstone at Dunlap's Creek, April 19, 1793. He soon received three calls-from Bethel and Ebenezer, Ten-Mile, and Cross Creek. He was a natural orator. The tones of his voice were so musical that he was called the \"Silver-tongued Marquis.\" He was pastor of Cross Creek Church for about thirty-three years. While on a visit to his son-in-law, Rev. Joseph Stevenson, he as attacked with fever, dying of same September 27, 1827, and was buried in the cemetery of Bellefontaine, Ohio. He had a large family of children, and his descendants are scattered far and wide. Rev. John M. Stevenson, D. D., one of the secretaries of the American Tract Society, at New York, Rev. James E. Marquis and Rev. Thomas Marquis Newell were grandsons. Rev. W. S. Marquis, pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Rock Island, Ill., is a great-grandson, and Mrs. Patton, wife of Rev. Dr. Patton, president of Princeton College, Princeton, N. J., is a great-granddaughter. Only one of the daughters of Thomas and Mary (Colville) Marquis (Anne) came from Virginia to this county; she married Maj. James Park, who was killed by the Indians on a farm now belonging to the heirs of Josiah N. Scott, Esq., in Jefferson township, this county. The other daughters married in Virginia-Sarah married John Vance, and lived near Holstein, Va.; Elizabeth married Daniel McCauley, and remained in Virginia.\n\nThere were some others of the name of Marquis who lived in this county, and were cousins of the children of Thomas and Mary (Colville) Marquis. George Marquis was one of the first bench of elders of cross Creek Church. Samuel Marquis also lived near Burgettstown, and John also lived in the same neighborhood. If these were first cousins of John and Rev. Thomas Marquis, as they claimed, William Marquis, who came from Ireland in 1720, must have left other children in Ireland, who came to America at a later period; and this appears most likely to be the case as all these parties came from near Winchester, Va., to this county.\n\n[Source: Commemorative Biographical Record of Washington County, Pennsylvania Vol. I, J H Beers & CO. 1893, page 182-184. - Contributed by Millie Mowry]\n\nANGUS M. L. McBANE, a retired lawyer and merchant of Shawneetown, Ill., and ex-judge of Gallatin county, is justly entitled to be classed as one of the foremost citizens of the city. The McBane family is of Scotch origin, the grandfather of Judge McBane coming from Scotland in the early part of the nineteenth century and settling at Cannonsburg, Pa., where he reared a family of children. One of his sons, Dr. A. M. L. McBane, was born at Cannonsburg in 1808. He received a fine literary education, which was supplemented by a complete course in the science of medicine. After graduating from medical college he traveled extensively through Europe, and upon returning to America located at Louisville, where he soon won eminence as a physician. In 1836 he went to Parkersburg, W. Va., and practiced there until 1842, when, in company with his brother William, he came to Illinois. The two brothers bought 1,600 acres of land where Metropolis City now stands, and 600 acres on the opposite side of the Ohio river in Kentucky. Here Dr. McBane passed the remainder of his life, in the practice of his profession and in looking after his large landed and commercial interests. His death occurred July 3, 1860. In 1836, while living in Louisville, he was married to Miss Ellen Willard of that city, though a native of New York. She was of English and French extraction, her father, Rev. Joseph Willard, having been an Episcopal minister at Newark, N. J., as early as 1806. Later he came West and died at Marietta, Ohio. He was a descendant of Maj. Simon Willard, who was somewhat famous in the early history of Boston. Dr. McBane and his wife had five children, viz.: Angus M. L., the subject of this sketch; Joseph, a graduate of the New Orleans Medical college, died on shipboard while crossing the Atlantic and was buried at sea; Ellen, deceased; Marietta, widow of William Ward, living in Chicago, the mother of three children, one son, Frank, being a traveling man and secretary of the Standard club; and William A., who was a real estate and insurance man of Metropolis City at the time of his death in 1903. Angus M. L. McBane was born at Parkersburg, W. Va,, Sept. 8, 1837. He was but five years of age when his parents came to Illinois. Ever since that time he has resided in that state and has been identified with the growth and development of Massac and Gallatin counties. He obtained his early education in the schools of Metropolis City, one of his teachers being Robert G. Ingersoll, who afterward achieved a world-wide reputation as an exponent of Agnosticism. Although nominally a student at this time young McBane was really an assistant teacher, Mr. Ingersoll devoting most of his time to Latin and history, leaving the greater part of his other school work to McBane. Later Judge McBane graduated from Princeton college of New York, after which he returned home, took up the study of law under Hon, C. G. Simons and W. H. Green, and in 1860 graduated from the law department of the Kentucky State University, at Louisville. He began practice at Metropolis City, but scarcely established himself when the Civil War broke out. His desire was to enter the service of his country, but the recent death of his father made it necessary for him to remain at home to look after the large estate and to care for the family. However, he organized two companies, one in White County, Ill., and the other at Ford's Ferry, Ky., both of which were mustered into the army as part of the Forty-eighth Illinois infantry, of which he was made adjutant, but for reasons already stated he was compelled to resign the position. He accompanied Grant's forces from Paducah to Pittsburg Landing, and in the capacity of expressman for Grant's army was present at the historic battle of Shiloh. In 1864 he removed to Shawneetown, where he was elected county judge the following year and held the position for four years. In addition to his large law practice Judge McBane became interested in the mercantile affairs of Shawneetown. For several years he conducted one of the largest general stores there and was a large buyer of grain. In 1877 he practically retired from both professional and commercial life, and since then has devoted his time to the management of his large and varied investments. He was married in 1862 to Miss Mary, daughter of John D. Richeson, whose sketch appears elsewhere in this work. They have no children. Judge McBane is a member and past dictator in the Knights of Honor; has been president of the Business Men's association ever since it was organized in 1890; was once a candidate for state senator, and is always active in promoting the general welfare of the- community in which he lives. His wife is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n[Memoirs of The Lower Ohio valley: Personal and Genealogical, Volume 2 By Federal Publishing Company, 1905 Transcribed by AFOFG] S\n\nThe Family of James Sloan\n\n1776-1851\n\nThis branch of the Sloan family came to Bradford from Washington county, Pennsylvania, the family having been founded there by James Sloan, born in 1776 in County Tyrone, Ireland, where there were other branches of the Sloan family.
