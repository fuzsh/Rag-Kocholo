        "text": "JAY-Z has struck a Migos-like deal for his company Roc Nation, with the entertainment powerhouse set to team up with Versace.\n\nIn a series of Instagram posts on Friday (February 9), Versace described the deal as a “transformative multi-year partnership” that will “range from the support of cause-focused initiatives to the sponsorship of high-profile events.”\n\nThe latter includes, most immediately, Versace’s sponsorship of a Super Bowl event on Friday thrown by Roc Nation Sports, the company’s sports management division.\n\nAmong the “cause-focused initiatives” will be support for the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment, a program at Long Island University that offers programs in entrepreneurship, music technology, sports management and more.\n\nThat this new partnership would begin with a Super Bowl-related event is no surprise, as Roc Nation has been in business with the NFL for years.\n\nBack in 2019 the company signed a deal with the league to aid in its social justice efforts and bolster its connections in the music industry.\n\nSince then, Roc Nation has served as the NFL’s “live music entertainment strategist,” which includes consulting on productions such as the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n“The NFL has a great big platform, and it has to be all-inclusive,” JAY-Z told TheNew York Times at the time. “They were willing to do some things, to make some changes, that we can do some good.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell added, “We don’t want people to come in and necessarily agree with us; we want people to come in and tell us what we can do better. I think that’s a core element of our relationship between the two organizations, and with JAY and I personally.”\n\nHov’s partnership with the NFL came after he turned down the league’s offer to perform at the Super Bowl LII halftime show. On The Carters’ EVERYTHING IS LOVE album, which received a perfect rating from HipHopDX, he mentioned his rebuffing of the gig on the single “APESHIT.”\n\n“I said no to the Super Bowl: you need me, I don’t need you/ Every night we in the end zone, tell the NFL we in stadiums too,” he rapped."
