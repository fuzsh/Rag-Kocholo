        "text": "Who’s in charge: the person out in front or the person behind the boards? This is an eternal pop music question with no firm answer. Rock and country largely don’t pretend that producers could be on equal footing with their stars, while hip-hop is more balanced, with producers having become a new class of celebrity.\n\nDance music has its own answer: the people who make the music, and often D.J. it live, are the ones who are best known, while the singers are often anonymous, or at least widely acknowledged second bananas.\n\nBut lately the stars of dance music have been giving up a bit of that advantage, in pursuit of something more elusive: American pop success. Artists like David Guetta and Calvin Harris, who are producers, D.J.’s and songwriters, have used high-profile collaborations with well-known singers to that end. It’s a sort of Faustian bargain, a rejection of their core principles while offering no guarantee that they’ll retain their dominance once they’ve crossed to the other side.\n\nMr. Harris has just released his third album, “18 Months” (Roc Nation/Ultra/Columbia), but his first as a bona fide pop contender in this country, after years of European stardom. It comes on the heels of the huge success of the single “We Found Love,” his collaboration with Rihanna that’s a staple of pop radio and is on his new album.\n\nMr. Harris is a more effective and vigorous but less thoughtful producer on this album than he was two albums ago. At various points here, he’s using bits of trance and big beat and progressive house and other king-size dance genres of the last 15 years, cues to fans who primarily engage with him from a dance floor.\n\nBut for the most part, this is style-agnostic club music, beholden more to a structural blueprint than to a particular set of finishes. Songs begin slowly, build during the first verse, explode at the chorus, dip again, re-explode, dally at the bridge for a while, then ebb. His instrumentation varies, but his shape does not. There’s little room to experience your own response, so heavily is the emotional arc dictated.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
