        "text": "Young Guru was announced as Roc Nation School’s Director of the Music Technology, Entrepreneurship & Production program. Within his career, he has worked with music greats like Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Mariah Carey. Now, Young Guru is ready to teach the next generation from his own experience in the game.\n\n“Education is a valuable platform to show talented students how to navigate the music industry, preserve music history, and share their culture with the world,” he said, according to the press release. “Joining the Roc Nation School is an incredible opportunity to offer my experience as a guide for up-and-coming artists and producers.”\n\n“The Roc Nation School is the premier destination for the next generation of professionals in the music industry who have the opportunity to learn directly from top executives and artists,” said Long Island University President Kimberly Cline. “We are thrilled to welcome Young Guru to the Roc Nation School’s leadership team. His decades of experience and expertise in the music business will be an incredible asset to the school.”\n\nWhat’s more, Young Guru wants to financially support one student to learn at the renowned school. As he’s excited to be in his new role and in his “education” chapter, he will award a full-tuition scholarship. Interested applicants are requested to submit an essay that explains what it would mean to them to attend Roc Nation School and learn from industry leaders like himself.\n\nYoung Guru’s initiative follows after full scholarships from Megan Thee Stallion and LaMelo Ball back in 2021.\n\nTo learn additional information about Young Guru’s full-tuition scholarship, click here."
