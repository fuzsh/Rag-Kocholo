        "text": "Jay-Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation and Versace, has joined forces to launch a multi-year partnership that will provide event sponsorships and scholarships for the next generation\n\nThe agreement entails events and scholarships for the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports, and Entertainment. The entertainment giant and Italian fashion house are coming together for other “cause-focused initiatives” as well.\n\nCentral to both Versace and Roc Nation is human capital and a commitment to creative empowerment, celebrating individuality, and fueling positive change,” Roc Nation wrote in a press statement. “Championing artists across music, entertainment, and broader cultural landscapes will be underscored through the partnership.”\n\nThe multi-year partnership began on Feb. 9 as Versace sponsored Roc Nation’s Sports 2024 Super Bowl event. The entertainment giant teamed up with the NFL in 2019 and has helped the league with social initiatives and its Super Bowl Halftime Show.\n\nRELATED POST: OPRAH, BEYONCE, AND SERENA WILLIAMS MAKE FORBES LIST OF WORLD’S 100 MOST POWERFUL WOMEN\n\n“With its global reach, the National Football League has the platform and opportunity to inspire change across the country,” Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in 2019. “Roc Nation has shown that entertainment and enacting change are not mutually exclusive ideas—instead, we unify them. This partnership is an opportunity to strengthen the fabric of communities across America.”\n\nRoc Nation’s Empowerment Initiatives\n\nBefore teaming up with Versace, Roc Nation had spearheaded initiatives that boost empowerment. The company has partnered with Reform Alliance to help New York residents who are single parents, formerly incarcerated, veterans, and members of poverty alleviation and workforce development.\n\nThe collaboration involved a job fair that offered access to thousands of job opportunities and various resources such as interview preparation, grooming services, and professional attire.\n\n“The Team Roc New York Job Fair is a real opportunity for socio-economic mobility for New Yorkers – those who want to work yet have not had the exposure or connections to the right jobs or to the support services that can strengthen their prospects for employment,” Dania Diaz, Team Roc Managing Director said in a press release. “It’s also a chance for us to work together – public, private, nonprofit sectors – to address the state’s labor shortages meaningfully.\n\nThe entertainment company has also had numerous stars join in helping provide scholarships to Long Island University’s (LIU’s) Roc Nation School of Music, Sports and Entertainment. The celebrities have included Megan Thee Stallion, LaMelo Ball and more."
