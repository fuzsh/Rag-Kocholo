I currently work for Gold Diggers Studio in East Hollywood and I also do freelance work on the side. I went to school at the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences in Arizona, after graduating I came back to Los Angeles and Interned at Kingsize Soundlabs. While Interning there I was asked to help with Gold Diggers. I found my self slowly climbing up the ladder, and soon became a house engineer. Being at Gold Diggers has allowed me to work with lots of diverse and talented artists and producers. Every day is different in between vocal sessions, band tracking, or song writing. It allows me to stay on my feet and consistently grow as an engineer. I always look forward to working with new people as we all learn and grow from all the diverse experiences.\n\nView Profile →\n\nSonita Alizada\n\nSonita Alizada is an Afghan rapper, human rights activist, and Rhodes Scholar, working to end child marriage. With a poet’s soul and an activist’s passion, she uses rap and courage to stand up for women’s and girls’ rights. Sonita was born in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime and spent her childhood as an undocumented refugee in Iran.Sonita’s parents tried twice to sell her into child marriage: at age 10 and again at 16. With the help of Rukhsareh Ghaemmaghami, Iranian filmmaker, who recorded her journey in a documentary “Sonita”, Ms. Alizada wrote and performed a rap song called \"Daughters for Sale” which went viral and was eventually viewed around the world. The song and ensuing publicity helped Sonita to obtain a full scholarship to come to the US to start high school in 2015. Today, Sonita is finishing a joint major at Bard College in New York in human rights and music. She will obtain her master in Diplomatic Studies at the University of Oxford in 2024. As an activist working to end child marriage, she has performed for heads of state, Nobel Laureates, and renowned change-makers and helped to develop a curriculum against child marriage which has been used by over one million students. Through her music and advocacy, Sonita wants to encourage world leaders and policymakers to take urgent action to end child marriage across the world. \"If girls are forced into early marriages, societies end up in cycles of poverty and illiteracy,” she says, \"if we want to see a more peaceful world, we need to prevent girls from being forced into early marriages and keep them in school.”\n\nView Profile →"
