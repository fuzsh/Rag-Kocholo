        "text": "From NWA to the Beatles, music has always provided the soundtrack to a revolution. And as Black Lives Matter and other social movements fight for change globally, artists around the world are coming together to create new projects and inspire communities.\n\nRoc Nation, an entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z in 2008, is contributing to the cause with its latest project “Reprise,” a collection of songs aimed at bringing awareness to social justice issues. The “musical protest” features some of the most prominent artists today, like Grammy-nominated rapper Rapsody and D Smoke.\n\nYahoo Life spoke with Rapsody, D Smoke, Chronixx and King Mel about the collective upcoming project and how music has played a part in their personal lives and how they view change.\n\n“It’s another creative way to touch people’s and touch people’s souls and bring them together as one. Music is one voice at the end of the day. You don’t have to speak the same language for someone to feel you,” Rapsody says.“The best way you can connect with people is through soul.”\n\n“When you have music that’s powerful and touches people’s souls, it has no choice but to shape the community,” rapper and former NFL player King Mel explains.\n\nThe collection of work is the artists’ declaration of advocacy to the world. Not only does the 12-track project express their views on racism and protests, but it also benefits organizations protecting civil rights. A portion of the proceeds will go to Gathering for Justice, Until Freedom, Equal Justice Initiative, Grassroots Law Project and NACDL Foundation for Criminal Justice (NFCJ) Law Enforcement Accountability Database Project.\n\n“Reprise” will be available on all streaming platforms on Friday, but you can check out Rapsody’s official music video for her song “12 Problems” below.\n\nWatch the full video above to hear these powerful music artists talk about “Reprise” and how it’s going to continue to help propel the movement.\n\nVideo produced by Kelly Matousek.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Life\n\nGabrielle Union opens up on 'AGT' ouster: 'Being blackballed in this industry is very real.'\n\nCoronavirus, Black Lives Matter, RBG: Why this 'Halloween House' gets political\n\nDrew Barrymore on teaching her children the importance of protesting: 'Such a catalyst for change'"
