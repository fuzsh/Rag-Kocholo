        "text": "Believe it or not, hip-hop was once considered as a fad, but over the past few decades, it has skyrocketed to become of music's biggest genres. When hip-hop first started, some aspiring MCs saw it as a creative outlet, while others saw it as a means to make a living.\n\nThe late '80s to '90s era was a time when artists started to see their music careers as a stepping stone to other endeavors. Once other artists started seeing how they could venture out and make their careers pretty lucrative, many of them followed suit.\n\nFrom brand deals to investments to entrepreneurship, here is a list of MCs who've broadened their career beyond the stage.\n\n2 of 20\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nSTEFANO RELLANDINI/AFP via Getty Images\n\nQueen Latifah is the definition of an artist who can do it all. Granted, she started her career as one of hip-hop’s most prominent MCs, but she’s always done so much more for herself and she does it well. From acting on TV shows like Living Single and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, to starring in films like Bringing Down the House and Hairspray, to hosting award shows and her own daytime TV talk show — Latifah’s career is impressive to say the least. Not only has she won plenty of awards such as Grammys, Emmys, and Golden Globes, but she also became the first female MC to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\n4 of 20\n\nIce Cube\n\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no doubt about it that Ice Cube helped usher in the West Coast rap style thanks to being a member of N.W.A. But in the ‘90s, Cube wanted to make a pivot into Hollywood and he got some encouragement from the late John Singleton. After playing roles in films like Boyz n the Hood and Higher Learning, Cube went on to take roles in other films such as the Friday franchise, Barbershop, All About The Benjamins, Are We There Yet?, and Ride Along. He also made his directorial debut in the 1998 film The Players Club. It's safe to say he's made his mark in music and film.\n\n11 of 20\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nNew York Yankees/Getty Images\n\nSnoop Dogg is truly a jack of all trades. Granted, he’s one of the most recognized and respected MCs who helped establish the hip-hop West Coast sound, but in music, he’s also ventured into the worlds of pop, reggae, and gospel. In addition to his music career, Snoop has made pivots into film and TV show hosting. He’s made waves in different industries including e-sports, food, and cannabis. One of his most prized ventures is running the Snoop Youth Football League, a non-profit organization that helps children participate in the sport. His youth league is filled with some eye-catching talent, as quite a few members have gone to sign contracts with the NFL."
