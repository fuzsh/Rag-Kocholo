        "text": "Christopher Booker, of PBS NewsHour sat down with Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation, Linda E. Johnson, President of the Brooklyn Public Library, and Independent Hip Hop Artist, Kota the Friend, to get their perspective on Jay Z’s ‘Book of HOV’ exhibit, and Jay Z’s influence on the music industry.\n\nJohnson stated, “This is a career that was built on the written word. Literacy is everything to us. Jay-Z is a very important Brooklynite, and we like to honor our own, and we’re proud to be affiliated with him.”\n\nThe Roc Nation team had been looking for a place to hold this sort of exhibit, but Perez stated, “nothing ever felt right. It just didn’t feel right. It didn’t feel like it belonged. And when I heard Linda speak, it just seemed like the perfect place that she was describing. And it’s a public space and it lends itself to everyone.”\n\nKota the Friend, an Independent Hip Hop Artist with millions of listeners globally, who was born and raised just blocks from Jay Z stated, “the first beat that I ever rapped was over a Jay-Z beat. He gave me the template, and I just put in my words. And that’s — that was the beginning of it.”\n\nKota the Friend turned down record labels to stay independent. He keeps all the profit from the millions who stream his music each month. He also owns a fashion and entertainment brand."
