Although her otherworldly, Ableton-assisted music is crammed full of hooks fit to sit alongside Rihanna and Taylor Swift in the Top 40, the Canadian musician/producer born Claire Boucher feels her place is and forever will be as an outsider.\n\n\"I'm a pop artist in a broad sense,\" she says in an email. \"Most music with traditional verse, chorus and bridge structures can probably be considered 'pop.' But I think most people think about Top 40 these days when they use the word 'pop,' and I'm emphatically not from that world.\""
