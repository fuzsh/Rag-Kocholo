        "text": "Jay Z, Jay Brown, and Desiree Perez have made sweeping changes at Roc Nation, but those changes were critical for the companyâs future.\n\nBack in December, I wrote Why Roc Nation May Move on From Its Record Label. Hereâs a segment:\n\nRoc Nation Records still has 24 artists signed to the label, but the sports division has nearly double that number. The music side of the house focuses more on artist management, most recently supporting Mariah Careyâs new album, but many of its managed acts are in the twilight years of their careers.\n\nIf trends continue, Roc Nation Records will be more symbolic than it is impactful. The label may soon become a mere vehicle for the 4:44 rapper to drop his own albums and an excuse to host bougie brunches before the Grammys. Itâs an inevitable, but logical, outcome based on the management structure that Shawn Carter and Roc Nation CEO Jay Brown built. The business can still thrive regardless of changes in the music industry.\n\nSoon after, changes started happening. In January, Phil McIntyre was out as president of Roc Nation Management. In March, Benny Pough, president of Roc Nation Records, was let go. In May, the company fired Azim Rashid (SVP Promotion), Orlando McGhee (SVP A&R), Gita Williams, (EVP Marketing), and Fairley McCaskill (Sr. Director Publicity).\n\nI wasnât surprised, but still, damn! Roc Nation cleaned house like a #1 seed that just got waxed in a second round playoff series.\n\nDespite the changes, Roc Nationâs not moving on from its record label just yet. Itâs turned a new leaf. Roc Nationâs Shari Bryant and Omar Grant have been named label co-presidents. The announcement came two days before Meek Mill and Jay Zâs announced the companyâs new joint venture âDream Chasers.\n\nWhat a week. What a wild first half of 2019! As Roc Nation gears up for this next chapter, it will need to maintain alignment within each business unit and across the entire music side of the company.\n\nPromote from within\n\nRoc Nationâs recently-fired execs all had brief stints at the company. Benny Pough came and went in less than 18 months. Phil McIntyre was at the company for less than ten months. Azim Rashid was there just over a year. Same with Fairley McCaskill. Thatâs barely enough time to evaluate the results of any strategic moves.\n\nFor an entire cohort of execs to depart, it means one of two things happened: One, the initial wave of 2017 and 2018 executive hirings was a strategic mistake. The companyâs power trio (COO Desiree Perez, CEO Jay Brown, and Jay Z) made these hires with a particular vision in mind but made a costly pivot away from that. Or two, there was an HR-related issue. (There were rumors that these firings were connected to Roc Nationâs lawsuit with Daniel Franco, the boxer who sued the company for injuries he sustained as a signed athlete, but Iâve yet to see anything conclusive on that front).\n\nAn HR-related issue may still be plausible, but the strategic misstep is much more likely. Most of these hires were high-ranking execs at other labels. Pough was an EVP at Epic Records. Rashid was an SVP at Capitol Records. Roc Nation likely wanted to match the experience and maturity of its roster with execs who have been around the block.\n\nItâs an understandable move, but there were several drawbacks. First, firms often hire waves of seasoned execs to course-correct and implement a new strategy. If Roc Nationâs goal was to better serve todayâs artists who are skeptical of label contracts and want to own their masters, thatâs a tough ask to put on a group of execs who all came from traditional record labels.\n\nSecond, those execs were all top-heavy, external hires. Their presence can discourage Roc Nationâs homegrown employees who want to build their careers with the company. If leadership roles are only filled by outsiders, employees may build resentment toward those hires and the managers who brought them in. Companies need a healthy balance of internal promotions and external hires to maintain organizational health.\n\nThe elevation of Bryant and Grant sends a strong message. Bryant started her career as an intern back at Roc-a-Fella Records, while Grant had been with Roc Nation for nine years. Their hires echo a sentiment thatâs close to Jay Zâs heart. At the Roc Nation-Dream Chasers press conference last week, Hov said âGot to clean the floors up before you own the building.â Throughout his career, Jay Z has brought his friends along the journey and put them in positions to blossom. Desiree Perez, Jay Brown, and Ty Ty have all worked with Jay Z for decades and are all in leadership positions at Roc Nation. That mentality is a large reason why rappers, athletes, and entertainers want to partner with Roc Nation. If that went away, Roc Nation would lose its edge.\n\nThe (co-) CEOs of the R-O-C?\n\nThe leadership change is exciting, but the decision to split the labelâs presidency role is head-scratching. Companies normally justify co-CEOs and co-presidents with a clear delineation of responsibilities. Salesforce, Whole Foods, and Oracle have proudly embraced this model. But Roc Nation has not spoken on it yet.\n\nThe Billboard article about the co-presidents was pretty vague:\n\n\"The pair will be tasked with boosting the imprint's talent roster, while developing strategies for current signed artists.\"\n\nTo be fair, co-leadership structures are fairly commonâeven when the title doesnât reflect it. The decision to team Grant and Bryant up might be a reflection of Roc Nationâs COO-CEO structure up top. Desiree Perez is the COO, Jay Brown is COO, and Jay Z is the founder. But they operate more like a âBig 3â that collectively lead the company.\n\nBut even with a clear designation of roles and responsibilities, the lack of a clear lead can make decision-making difficultâespecially for a company that is under drastic changes. It can also cause added stress. If one personâs slate of responsibilities has more influence on the companyâs future, the âcoâ title might seem meaningless.\n\nSegment the business units\n\nLast year, Roc Nation launched Equity Distributionâan independent distribution service company. Itâs not nearly as public as competing services but has made headlines by signing Jay Zâs old friend Jaz O, Ryan Leslie, and others. Thereâs now a great opportunity to define the scope for Roc Nation, Dream Chasers, and Equity Distribution respectively.\n\nRoc Nationâs label should still focus on the smaller segment of popular, experienced artists who are later in their careers. Dream Chasers should serve up-and-coming artists who have the potential to pop. And Equity Distribution should focus on the vast number of indie acts who are just starting out, or those who want to avoid record label contracts altogether.\n\nItâs an opportunity to segment the long-tail:\n\nIn my December article, I compared Roc Nationâs strategy to Amazon since both companies started with a core productâbooks and record label contracts, respectivelyâthen expanded. But a much better comparison (and aspiration for Roc Nation) is Disney Studios.\n\nHereâs a segment of what I wrote last week in my update on Meek Millâs joint venture:\n\n\"Roc Nationâs signed artists are further along in their careers than most record labels. It makes strategic sense for Dream Chasers to focus on younger artists instead. That way, Roc Nation can focus on its core competency (established acts) and still have a vested interest in rising artists. Itâs no different than Disney Studios managing both Fox Searchlight for art-house films and 20th Century Fox for its blockbusters.\"\n\nEach of Disneyâs film studios has a distinct brand of movies that they release. But most record labels donât have that. Due to all major label mergers and acquisitions, itâs hard to differentiate a âCapitol Records rapperâ from an âInterscope rapper.â\n\nRoc Nation has an opportunity to improve upon that. Itâs a lofty goal. But itâs attainable with the right discipline."
