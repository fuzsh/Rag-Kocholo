This is probably the most overlooked track on Art Angels despite it being the opening track. While it may not shine as much as some of the other tracks on this album, lets be real: the whole album slaps af and this is still a really great song.\n\nSong: Led Zeppelin - Rock and Roll\n\nGenre: Classic Rock\n\nDescription: There are probably tons of rock songs with rock in the title and yet this probably still stands out the most. Led Zeppelin is so much the very definition of rock music to me and even though this may be a very popular and well known track, this still stands out as one of their best and an absolute classic.\n\nSong: Metric - Breathing Underwater\n\nGenre: Alternative\n\nDescription: Okay okay I know technically this is \"underwater\" which is 1 word, but eh close enough. For my water pick, I wanted to do something a bit less known and shine a spotlight on one of my favorite bands, who definitely deserve more streams.\n\nSong: Lady Gaga - Dance In The Dark\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: My favorite gaga song, super overlooked and hits so hard in many ways.\n\nThat's all (for now) folks! Hope you enjoy these extra themed recs!\n\nMaybe I'll come back to this later and fill out the rest of the types.\n\nJuly's Song Recommendations\n\nTheme: Spotlight On An Unknown Artist!​\n\nOwners\n\nskies\n\nSong: The Pom-Poms – Watch Me\n\nGenre: pop\n\nDescription: i like the girls with their nails done long dance real hard to the emo songs\n\nModerators\n\nBuffy\n\nSongs: Metric - Speed The Collapse | Metric - Gold Guns Girls | Metric - The Shade | Metric - Risk | Metric - The Wanderlust\n\nGenre: Alternative\n\nDescription: Metric has a very unique alternative sound and for my spotlight I've chosen songs from a bunch of different albums, so if you like each one, you'll have a lot of different albums to check out! Black Sheep is also one of their best (and you may know it from the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack). Definitely check 'em out!\n\nPeary\n\nSongs: PE$O PETE - MARINEFORD | PE$O PETE - Punk Hazard | PE$O PETE - Midnight Gospel Freestyle | PE$O PETE - FLARE BLITZ!\n\nGenre: Trap, Nerdcore\n\nDescription: Been a fan since Pokemon Cypher 2019, PE$O can really rap well and I even have a collab song with him coming up\n\nMDM234\n\nSongs: Wilderun - Far From Where Dreams Unfurl | Wilderun - Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (Iron Maiden cover) | Wilderun - Storm Along | Wilderun - Bite the Wound (Ash Memory Part III) | Wilderun - When the Fire and the Rose Were One\n\nGenre: Symphonic/Progressive Folk Metal\n\nDescription: One of my absolute favorite bands, incredibly over the top and cheesy take on folk metal, but they do it absolutely brilliantly. Veil of Imagination (my favorite album of 2019) and Sleep at the Edge of the Earth are absolute musts for anybody who has any sort of interest in cheesy metal at all. Can't recommend this band enough.\n\nNoct\n\nSongs: Mohama Saz - De Las Moscas Del Mercado | Mohama Saz - Hueso y Luz | Mohama Saz - Huracán Raki\n\nGenre: psychedelic rock\n\nDescription: super cool spanish psych band with anatolian rock influences.\n\n16bit\n\nSong: Artist - Title?\n\nGenre: J-pop, Progressive Pop, Nu-Jazz\n\nDescription: Honestly I could've put like 10 more genres here this dude is nuts, if you like this check out the EP this is from the entire thing is awesome\n\nCJEY\n\nSong: Kidsnorlax - Lost my DS stylus\n\nGenre: Screamo / Hyperpop\n\nDescription: GAMEBOY SLUT\n\nZa\n\nSongs: Kyrbgrinder - Where Do We Go From Here | Kyrbgrinder - Cynical World\n\nGenre: Progressive/Funk Metal\n\nDescription: Pretty unique 3-piece band fronted by Threshold drummer Johanne James, who is both the drummer and vocalist for Kyrbgrinder... they have released 3 albums, and their 2010 release Cold War Technology is the strongest of the 3, with the 2 songs linked being a couple of the highlights. I wanted to include one song from their 2015 album, which is also quite good, but it’s not uploaded anywhere on YouTube...\n\nGota Love Yaoi\n\nSongs: Airospace - The Ailment We Call Envy | Airospace - Haruko (pt. II) | Airospace - Circle | Airospace - You Can't Fit A Square Peg In A Round Hole\n\nGenre: Cloud Rap, Emo Rap, idfk\n\nDescription: I've been rockin with Airospace since like 2014, always wanted him to make it bigger. Super dark and depressing lyrics, cloudy beats, and extremely cathartic delivery.\n\nClouds\n\nSongs: Lower Dens - Real Thing | Lower Dens - Ondine | Lower Dens - I Get Nervous | Lower Dens - I Drive | Lower Dens - To Die in L.A.\n\nGenre: Indie Pop\n\nDescription: Headlined by Jana Hunter who is immensely talented & creative with mv concepts, reminds me a little of Avey Tare in terms of art style too. Lower Dens is based in Baltimore as well, just like Animal Collective, & they're a talented group that's released a lot of tracks that are nice to just like.. space out while listening to.\n\nDrivers\n\nSaiges\n\nSong: Alice Glass - Forgiveness\n\nGenre: witch house\n\nDescription: the hold that goth girls have on society...\n\njeromewt\n\nSong: Durag Dynasty - Tender Greens | Planet Asia and Apollo Brown - Panties in a Jumble | Planet Asia - Over your head ft. Black Thought https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH8t9Qo2mxI Planet Asia - Get Hit up ft. SmooVth\n\nGenre: hip hop\n\nDescription: PA is one of the most slept on ever, dope lyricist and he makes you feel every word, perfect beat selection has worked with some of the greatest producers ever and he dropping fire since 99. He was in the group durag dynasty and got a lot of solo work too my favorite tapes from him are 360 waves, anchovies, and the medicine\n\nRaihan Kibana\n\nSongs: Diamanda Galás - Let My People Go | Diamanda Galás - Double-Barrel Prayer | Diamanda Galás - Deliver Me From Mine Enemies | Diamanda Galás - There Are No More Tickets to the Funeral\n\nGenre: Avant-garde, Gothic Rock, Blues Rock\n\nDescription: No other word works here besides art. A large portion of her early work(the Plague Mass trilogy) is based heavily on church music being recontextualized to highlight the cruelty of the church during the AIDS crisis(fit with a satirical mockery of preaching). She's not afraid to go into full operatic screeching alongside her low register singing and blues piano playing to convey the ever-present anger in her music.\n\nVoices\n\nbreakthru89\n\nSongs: Daniel Romano - Rhythmic Blood | Daniel Romano - Between the Blades of Grass | Daniel Romano - Sucking The Old World Dry\n\nGenre: Psychedelic rock, Folk\n\nDescription: Daniel Romano is a very cool guy style-wise, with a ton of random genres thrown in, mainly country, folk, and psychedelia. His voice is very nice to listen to and his songs are generally quite solid quality-wise. He has a ton of creative concepts with his music and I admire that. Just an overall cool guy with some bangers.\n\ntomatopeeler\n\nSongs: Roc Marciano - History | DJ MUGGS x ROC MARCIANO - Shit I'm On | Roc Marciano - Emeralds | Roc Marciano - Richard Gear\n\nGenre: Hip hop\n\nDescription: great beats + great wordplay\n\nnamda\n\nSongs: Tatsuya Kitani - Ghost!? | Tatsuya Kitani - HIDE AND SEEK\n\nGenres: Jrock, alternative rock, indie rock\n\nDescription: (Ghost!?) very quirky with elements of jazz in Ghost!?, accompanied by a very interesting video. (HIDE AND SEEK) very fun rock song with super headbop vibes\n\nAugust's Song Recommendations\n\nTheme: The Name Game!\n\n​\n\nOwners\n\nRage\n\nSongs: Black Sabbath - Evil Woman | Midnight - Woman of Flame\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal | Black/Speed Metal\n\nDescription: One of Sabbath's first songs, a cover originally by the blues band Crow, and the second a fun song by a fun band, black/speed metal needs more love\n\nskies\n\nSongs: Aphex Twin - Nanou 2 | Tinashe - 2 On (Explicit) ft. SchoolBoy Q\n\nGenre: Piano | Hip-hop\n\nDescription: Nanou 2 is a very chilling piano piece that will make you very sad but in a good way. On the other hand, 2 On is about partying and having fun with your girls! Aphex Twin and Tinashe would be an interesting collaboration, but for now we can go from getting misty eyed to immediately remembering how fun it is to party. Honestly? They're an unexpected but amazing duo; the ending of the piano in Nanou 2 perfectly starts the intro of 2 On!\n\nModerators\n\nBuffy\n\nSongs: Killswitch Engage - This Fire | The Prodigy - Firestarter\n\nGenre: Metalcore | Electronic\n\nDescription: Easily Killswitch's best song. The instrumentation, lyrics and just how it's all put together is just perfection. And Firestarter is definitely a top 5 Prodigy song, just overall a very fun song and brings me back to Charlie's Angels days.\n\nCJEY\n\nSongs: Gang Starr - Moment of Truth | Fantasia - Truth is\n\nGenre: Rap | R&B\n\nClouds\n\nSongs: Fiona Apple - Sleep to Dream |\n\nGenre: Pop, Indie Pop | New Wave\n\nDescription: Personally, I don't sleep to dream of Mickey Mantle. But some might! Sleep to Dream is my favorite track from Fiona's masterful album Tidal, while Dream of Mickey Mantle is a lesser known track from Bleachers. Together they don't have much synergy, but they do make a sentence, and that's what we're here for.(edited)\n\nNoct\n\nSongs: Stereolab - Les Yper-Sound | David Bowie - Sound Vision\n\nDescription: one of the more chill cuts off of ETK and the seminal song off of bowie's masterpiece, low. both songs bring a nice atmosphere, both are catchy, but yet experimental, and both happen to be one of my favorite bands and my all time favorite musical artist.\n\nZa\n\nSongs: System of a Down - Jet Pilot | Threshold - Pilot in the Sky of Dreams\n\nGenre: Alternative Metal | Progressive Metal\n\nDrivers\n\nRaihan Kibana\n\nSongs: Fiona Apple - Paper Bag | Mitski - Bag of Bones\n\nGenre: Pop | Alt/Indie\n\nDescription: These are both piano-heavy songs about longing for love in an unfulfilling relationship from amazing lyricists so I think it fits. Paper Bag is definitely my favorite Fiona Apple, her singing on the track is just sublime. Bag of Bones is classic Mitski song, Lush has some of her best writing and singing imo and this song definitely fits that bill to me; when someone only likes you for your body then you're nothing but a used bag of bones trapped in the toxic relation by unrequited want for deeper love. Kinda extreme compared to Paper Bag but I suppose they still fit thematically\n\nVoices\n\nBreakthru89\n\nSongs: Linda Ronstadt - You're No Good | The Beach Boys - Good Vibrations\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Two classics that just so happen to work together. one of ronstadt's absolute best cover songs, you're no good is a whole bop and a half. good vibrations is one of the most fun songs i've listened to. the vibe is so cool, and both are some of my fav artists in general.\n\nJeromewt\n\nSongs: Ariana grande - goodnight n go | Sza - go gina\n\nGenre: Pop | R&B\n\nDescription:\n\nnamda\n\nSongs: YOASOBI - Racing into the Night | COOL&CREATE/BeatMARIO - Night of Nights\n\nGenre: J-Pop | EDM\n\nDescription: Racing into the Night is the absolute BANGER that turned YOASOBI into one of the most popular artists in Japan! if you know japanese, (or google the lyrics' translations) it's quite a sad song but despite that it's still a BOP !!!! Night of Nights is a remix of a song called Flowering Nights from the Touhou games. Night of Nights is one of the songs that got me into the Japanese music scene and I will never forget this particular song - it's super catchy!\n\nSeptember's Song Recommendations\n\nTheme: Genre Crossovers​\n\nOwners\n\nRage\n\nSong: Christina Aguilera fr. Redman | Dirrrty\n\nGenre: Pop / Rap\n\nDescription: Christina goes hard and Redman always consistent wherever he shows up\n\nskies\n\nSong: The Neighbourhood | Givin N' Takin (feat. Danny Seth & DeJLoaf)\n\nGenre: Indie Pop / British Rap\n\nDescription: a weird combination of british rap and an american indie pop band. this – b&w – is the nbhd's most experimental album featuring tons of hip-hop features and collaborations. this one in particular stands out because of the stark contrast between the two; the song feels like you're getting slung around but like in a good way\n\nModerators\n\nBuffy\n\nSong: Linkin Park + Jay-Z | Numb/Encore\n\nGenre: Rap / Rock\n\nDescription: Pretty sure Linkin Park x Jay-Z is the origin of Rap Rock and this song just fuses the two genres so well.\n\nCJEY\n\nSong: Gazelle Twin & NYX | Fire Leap\n\nGenre: Ritual Ambient / Choral / Post-Industrial\n\nGota^_^Love^_^Yaoi\n\nSong: The Microphones | The Glow, Pt. 2\n\nGenre: Folk / Noise Rock\n\nDescription:\n\nIf u listen 2 this song your crush will confess their love 4 u but if u dont u will never find love\n\nnoct\n\nSong: Panopticon | Black Soot and Red Blood\n\nGenre: Black Metal / Bluegrass\n\nDescription: has no right to be this good but it works\n\nPeary\n\nSong: CITY MORGUE | 33rd Blakk Glass\n\nGenre: Trap Metal\n\nDescription: City Morgue is one of my personal fav artists in the emerging Trap Metal scene that blends elements from both Trap Rap and Metal\n\nRaihan Kibana\n\nSong: Diamanda Galás & John Paul Jones | Hex\n\nGenre: Avant-garde / Rock / Blues\n\nDescription: This song sounds exactly like how you'd expect this collaboration to sound like. Galás doing her crazy shit singing fully in Greek backed by organ and a banging rhythm section.\n\nza\n\nSong: Mr. Bungle | Egg\n\nGenre: Avant-garde Metal / Experimental Rock / Jazz / Ska / other things\n\nDescription: It's hard to describe exactly the type of music that Mr. Bungle makes, but whatever it is, I like it\n\nDrivers\n\nsaiges\n\nSong: The Garden (feat. Mac DeMarco) | Thy Mission\n\nGenre: Punk / Indie\n\nDescription: a cute collab and the whistles make me feel like im playing wii sports(edited)\n\nVoices\n\nbreakthru89\n\nSong: Eminem ft. Dido | Stan\n\nGenre: Rap / Pop\n\nDescription: one of the most haunting songs of the early 2000s, and the origin of the term \"stan\". one of the best m&m tracks, and poignant documentation of the darker powers of fame\n\nLadyxBeans\n\nSong: King Crimson | Fracture\n\nGenre: Prog Rock / Instrumental\n\nDescription: One of the only songs off of Starless and Bible Black to not be a full improv piece and a song that took a man 22 years to learn. Sounds Villainous"
