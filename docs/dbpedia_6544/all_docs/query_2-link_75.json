        "text": "Roc Nation is an American record label and music publishing company.\n\nIt was reported that Jay-Z, no longer heading Def Jam and coming up on his last album for the company, has already inked a deal with Live Nation to set up an imprint called Roc Nation.[1] Implementing a reportedly redesigned business model, the label serves as management for Wale and Melanie Fiona, and has signed North Carolina rapper J.Cole.[2] It is unknown which artists will be shifted from Roc-A-Fella to Roc Nation.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Jay-Z is finalizing a deal with concert promoter Live Nation for $150 million, one of the richest contracts ever awarded to a musician. This partnership, which will be named Roc Nation, will include financing for Jay-Z's own entertainment ventures (which are expected to become a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company). Live Nation is expected to contribute $5 million a year in overhead for five years, with another $25 million available to finance Jay-Z's acquisitions or investments. Roc Nation would then split profits with Live Nation. To finalize the deal, Jay-Z will depart from Def Jam Records after he turns in his last required album under his talent contract. Jay-Z will be the first hip-hop artist to sign with Live Nation.[3]"
