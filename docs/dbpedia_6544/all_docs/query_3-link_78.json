        "text": "TFM represents over 100 soccer players including Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior\n\nFrederico Pena, TFM founder, becomes president of the new venture\n\nRedmond says RNSI is looking at “a couple of acquisitions” in other markets\n\nRoc Nation Sports’ executive vice president and global head of football Alan Redmond believes the firm has acquired “the best possible agency in Brazil” with its purchase of TFM Agency seeing Roc Nation Sports International (RNSI) expanding its operations to the South American country.\n\nHeadquartered in São Paulo, TFM Agency represents more than 100 soccer players, including Real Madrid star Vinícius Júnior, Arsenal ace Gabriel Martinelli and Real-bound Palmeiras wonderkid Endrick. The agency’s talents are now set to benefit from RNSI’s assistance as part of the newly-created Roc Nation Sports Brazil division.\n\nFrederico Pena, founder of TFM, will serve as the new venture’s president, which aims to provide players with a level of service unique to the Brazilian market.\n\n“Often, the priority of a football agent in Brazil, is to locate local talent, export them, get paid and move on to the next one,” Redmond told SportsPro in May.\n\n“It’s very transactional and it’s completely opposed to the way that we work. We like to work with the athlete, build a team around them, and make sure that everything on and off the pitch is where they’re needed to be.\n\n“We felt that when you looked at the high level of player produced in Brazil, and then you looked at the level of service that the player was very often receiving, there was a huge gap in what that level of client should expect and what they received. And we felt that we could fill that gap.\n\n“I don’t want to overstate the significance of what we’re doing, but I can’t ignore the significance of it. This is a market that historically was dominated by third-party ownership, where players were being sold by agents who earned massive pieces of the transfer fee. It just wasn’t a player protective market. I think other agencies will be forced to change in a positive way based on the impact our work will have.”\n\nAccording to Redmond, who researched and met with several agencies, TFM stood out for its structure and leadership. As well as its operations being aligned with Roc Nation, he credits Pena’s leadership and knowledge of the Brazilian soccer industry and how external countries view the country’s talent.\n\n“I saw with TFM it was like a route forward, but you could also see the route from where they’ve come and there’s consistency there,” continued Redmond.\n\nRNSI is a division of entertainment mogul Jay Z’s Roc Nation agency, with its client roster including the likes of Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku and Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards. Redmond added that the new venture will allow for the agency’s pre-current clients to gain commercial opportunities and exposure in Brazil.\n\nRedmond also revealed that RNSI is already eyeing “a couple of acquisitions” in different areas. He cautioned, though, that a successful launch of its Brazilian venture would need to take place before any moves elsewhere can be made.\n\n“We’re going to launch the Brazilian operation and get that into a situation where any teething problems are ironed out immediately before we consider moving on to the next one,” Redmond stated. “It’s not a necessity for us, just if the right opportunity comes along. But we don’t stop looking.”\n\nBrazilian soccer has recently seen a surge in interest from investors, with Esporte Clube Bahia and Coritiba examples of clubs that have been taken over. As well as the country being a hotbed for soccer talent, new laws have been passed that allow domestic teams to operate as limited liability companies run by external investors. Redmond believes that this should ultimately help the quality of the domestic soccer landscape.\n\n“I don’t want to equate foreign ownership with more professional ownership,” he said. “Because in Brazil, they know what they’re doing, the clubs have got modern structures and the scouts are unbelievable. The level of coaching there is very high.\n\n“So I don’t necessarily equate that, but I think what you’ll have is that the new structures will bring greater financial security to the clubs, stabilise them and perhaps allow them to hang onto a player for another year or two, and sell at a higher price, which will give them a little bit more power.\n\n“They can maybe now grow a little more. If those players can stay in the league for a year or two longer, then obviously the quality of the league improves, which helps with its marketability and visibility globally.”"
