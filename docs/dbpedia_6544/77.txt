Roc Nation, the music and entertainment company co-founded by rapper Jay Z, has opened a Nashville office and entered into a partnership with publisher Warner/Chappell Music.

The deal is centered around songwriter, producer, publisher and DJ Jesse Frasure. Under the deal, Frasure's new venture, Rhythm House, will handle his songwriting and production work in addition to signing and developing new writers and producers.

Frasure was recently at Major Bob Music and has worked with artists such as Florida Georgia Line and Meghan Trainor.

"I’m honored and grateful to begin this next chapter with partners like Roc Nation and Warner/Chappell, whom I’ve admired throughout my career," Frasure said in a news release.

Warner/Chappell Music promoted BJ Hill to vice president of A&R as part of the deal as well.

“There is nothing like working with the right individuals, at the right time, forming the right partnership," said Jay Brown, Roc Nation co-founder and president. "Launching Roc Nation Nashville with Warner/Chappell Music Nashville is a natural extension of the relationship we started so many years ago, and our venture with Jesse Frasure and his Rhythm House take the possibilities to a next level."

Brown lauded Frasure's creative talents in prepared comments on Tuesday. Frasure co-produced Thomas Rhett's sophomore album, "Tangled Up," and has spun for celebrity clients across the world in his work as a DJ.

"Jesse’s talent, understanding of the craft and creativity are unmatched," Brown said. "We’re also excited to work with BJ Hill. He has a passion and respect for artists and their artistry, and we look forward to working alongside him as we grow the Roc Nation Nashville roster.”

Roc Nation is a full-service artist, songwriter, producer and engineer management company founded in 2008. Rihanna, Shakira and HAIM are among its prominent clients.
