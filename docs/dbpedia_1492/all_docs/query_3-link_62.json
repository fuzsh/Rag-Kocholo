        "text": "WARNING: The RCA Camden Label was established in 1957 as a value-for-money \"budget\" compilation release. The label was purposely designed for sale at very low \"affordable\" prices. While it was claimed that the quality of these releases were not being compromised, the facts clearly show this not to be the case. Common sense clearly suggests that it's impossible ( pardon the pun ) to maintain the same engineering standards for a budget release label such as RCA Camden as compared with the premium RCA Victor label. In 1957 this may have been reasonably possible but with the advent of stereo recordings, and higher technical standards, this claim became increasingly difficult to maintain. By 1960 the number of tracks contained within the average Camden album was reduced from 12 to 10 and for stereo Camden releases it wasn't uncommon for some tracks to be reprocessed from monaural masters to simulate stereo. In general, Camden releases are remastered from second generation sources and that continues to be the case even today within compact disc compilations. While some RCA Camden compilations can be very good, as were a number of Perry's original Camden albums, it is an unusual occurrence."
