        "text": "My ‘Alice in Wonderland’ book collection, mainly consists of different editions of Carroll’s books. Another part of my collection, that I love dearly, is the parodies of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nAs with Alice in Wonderland films, the parodies started off early. The earliest were published at the turn of the 20th century. Since then, there are news Alice parodies published every few years or so. I’ll go over the few I have in my personal collection. This post will be dedicated solely to the political parodies, and I’ll dedicate another post for other types of Alice parodies. If you own, know of other political Alice parodies, please mention them in the comments section below. To review more works based on Alice in Wonderland, head to page. Let’s go over them:\n\nThe Westminster Alice – “Saki” H. H. Munro, illustrated by F. Carruthers Gould, 1902. (My copy is a later 1927 printed edition)\n\nThe Westminster Alice criticizes the Boer war, by using the Alice storyline and Tenniel’s illustrations. Every illustration in this book carries a formal apology to Tenniel, and everyone concerned.\n\nClara in Blunderland – Caroline Lewis (pseudonym of Edward Harold Begbie, J. Stafford Ransome, and Michael Henry Temple), illustrated by S. R. (J. Stafford Ransome), 1902.\n\nThis book also criticizes the Boer War, with the British PM, Balfour, as Alice. A year later, the same team, published a sequel ‘Lost in Blunderland’.\n\n*On a side note, isn’t it amazing that in 1902, two separate Alice parodies came out, criticizing the same subject?!\n\nMalice in Kulturland – Horace Wyatt\n\nIllustrated by W. Tell. 1914\n\n‘Malice in Kulturland’, WW1 anti-German pro-British parody, that utilizes Lewis Carroll books, and Tenniel’s illustrations.\n\nThe whole thing, text and illustrations are online here.\n\nFrankie in Wonderland – “A Tory”, 1934\n\nAn anti- Franklin D. Roosevelt, anti-new deal, uncredited, republican party propaganda piece, with a short storyline very loosely based on Alice, with a printed apology to Lewis Carroll.\n\nAdolf in Blunderland – James Dyrenforth & Max Kester\n\nIllustrated by Norman Mansbridge. 1939\n\nAn Anti-Hitler & Nazi Germany political parody from the beginning of WW2. With illustrations and storyline that follows Carroll’s story in general."
