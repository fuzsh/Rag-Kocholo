        "text": "Happy New Year!\n\nWith the start of a new year, we have new works entering the public domain. January 1, 2024 marks the date that items published in the year 1928 enter the public domain in the United States. Items in the public domain are free from copyright protections and can be legally shared without needing to ask permission or pay fees. January 1st of any given year is the date that items typically enter into the public domain. This happens 70 years after the death of the author, 95 years from the date of publication, or 120 years from the date of creation – typically whichever comes first, but there are lots of exceptions (see this Cornell chart for more details). Also, just because something is in the public domain in the United States doesn’t mean it’s not protected within other countries.\n\nIn celebration of the release of copyrighted works into the public domain, I wanted to share a not-at-all-comprehensive list of items that entered the public domain on January 1st. If you are a faculty member, take a look at the list and see if any of this content would be useful in the courses you teach. Public domain means access to content should be free or relatively cheap (great news for your students), and fair game for remixing and reusing (great news for you). I’ve provided links to UT owned copies where possible to allow users to access materials. Please keep in mind that those copies I’ve linked to may be later editions, translations, recordings, or otherwise modified in ways that still may be protected by copyright.\n\nDisclaimer: I tried to find a couple sources for each item listed, but please use this list with care and do your own research on publication dates.\n\nFilm\n\nAlraune: Dir.
