        "text": "Keys Fine Art Auctioneers do not provide an in-house postage service, however we can offer our own limited personal courier service using our own transport to most areas of England - quotations available on request, please contact us prior to sale if you wish to use this service. This is quoted and invoiced seperately from sale invoices, and all purchaser invoices must be settled within the prescribed timescale prior to requesting a delivery quotation. We also work closely with local shipping company:Mailboxes – 37 St. Andrews Street, Norwich, Norfolk, NR2 4TP. Tel: 01603 926420 or email info@mbenorwich.co.uk (NB - Mailboxes operate independently of Keys Auctioneers so postage and packing will need to be organised and paid direct to their team.Upon being paid, Mailboxes will send their team to Keys to collect the item and organised shipping)."
