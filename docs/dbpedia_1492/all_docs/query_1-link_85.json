Four years later, Oklahoma's governor Mary Fallin pulled the tune as the state's official rock song in a move her office said had more to do with priorities than musical taste.\n\nFireThe Pointer Sisters\n\nBruce Springsteen originally wrote \"Fire\" for Elvis Presley in 1977, and even sent him a demo. Sadly the King died before he ever heard it, and it was left to the Pointer Sisters to record the song.\n\nTV Theme SongsFact or Fiction\n\nWas a Beatles song a TV theme? And who came up with those Fresh Prince and Sopranos songs?\n\nEmmylou HarrisSongwriter Interviews\n\nShe thinks of herself as a \"song interpreter,\" but back in the '80s another country star convinced Emmylou to take a crack at songwriting."
