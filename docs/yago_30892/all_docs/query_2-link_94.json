        "text": "Major Characters\n\nCyrus Trask\n\nCyrus is the stern father of Adam and Charles. His military career is cut short when he was shot in the right leg during the Civil War. His amputated leg is replaced first by a wooden and then by a steel prosthesis. Cyrus, who âwas something of a devil,â contracted gonorrhea while in the service and passed it onto his first wife, who kills herself as a result (14). After the death of his wife, he quickly remarries and fathers his second son, Charles.Â His perceived favoring of Adam causes a violent and lifelong rift between his sons.Â Cyrus is very proud of his involvement in the military. He peremptorily decides Adam will join the military as he believes his weaker son needs discipline to make him a man.Â In his spare time, he writes perceptive articles criticizing military strategy.Â As a result he is offered a paid position with the General Army of the Republic (G.A.R) and travels around the country lobbying and speaking about military issues. After the death of his second wife, he re-locates to Washington D.C. to continue his work with the military. He dies of pneumonia in 1894 and many high-level government officials attend his funeral. He leaves Adam and Charles an inheritance of $100,000. The boys are never sure how Cyrus amassed his fortune though Charles suspects his father had stolen the money.\n\nAdam Trask\n\nAdam was born in 1862 on a Connecticut farm to father, Cyrus and Cyrusâs first wife whose name is never mentioned.Â His mother commits suicide when Adam is still a baby. He is raised by Cyrusâ second wife Alice. Cyrus views him as weak and less intelligent than his brother Charles, which confirms his decision to force Adam to enlist in the military, a prospect that terrifies Adam. He was a quiet, obedient child who shied away from conflict and violence. He catches on early that his father tends to exaggerate about himself and knows that his father was not a great man (20). During his first five years in the army, Adam develops a deeper aversion to violence and volunteers to work in field hospitals.\n\nAfter being discharged in 1885, he wanders around Chicago for a few weeks to avoid moving back home with Charles. Not knowing what to do next, he re-enlists in the military.Â He is discharged again in 1890 in San Francisco. He spends the next three years wandering around the country and eventually serves time in jail for vagrancy.Â Upon arriving back at the farm, Charles tells him about their inheritance. Adam stays on at the farm with Charles for a few years. After growing restless, he takes off for months at a time traveling around the world, especially when he and Charles would quarrel. Adam is not content to continue living on the farm and talks of moving to California which further irks Charles. When Cathy, after being beaten by Mr. Edwards, arrives on their doorstep, Adam takes her in and cares for her. He proposes before she is completely well and they are soon married. Adam and his new bride relocate to Salinas, California. His intention is to build a new âEden,â where he can create a lasting legacy for his family.\n\nUnfortunately for Adam, he is completely deceived about the identity if his wife.Â Once she shoots him and deserts him with her newborn twin sons, Adam falls into a hopeless stupor, leaving his Chinese-American man-servant Lee to raise his children.Â He does not even name them until Samuel Hamilton forces him to do so when the twins are fifteen months old.Â It is another 10 years, after a confrontation with his estranged wife, before Adam actually takes an interest in raising his sons. The boys, however, have already been permanently affected by that time. Both long for the acceptance of father and mother and embark on an inner struggle that is exacerbated on the one hand by Calâs perception of his fatherâs favoring of Aron and Aronâs embarrassment over his fatherâs failed business venture.Â In the end, Adam has repeated the mistake of his own father causing a rift between his two sons.Â He seems to redeem himself on his deathbed by forgiving and accepting Cal who has suffered his entire life from being estranged from his emotionally aloof father.\n\nCharles Trask\n\nCharles is the son of Cyrus and Alice Trask and half-brother of Adam. Charles is considered stronger, quicker, and smarter than Adam.Â Adam possesses a secret fear of Charles, who is prone to outbreaks of murderous rage. When Adam is old enough to enlist, Cyrus has a private talk with him about his future in the military. Charles overhears the conversation and becomes envious of his fatherâs interaction with Adam.Â His envy, combined with his bitterness over Cyrusâs preference of the birthday gift Adam had given him, enrages Charles.Â Charles blames Adam for his feelings of rejection and severely beats and then chases after Adam, intending to kill him.\n\nAfter Adam leaves for the Army and his mother dies, Charles is left alone to run the family farm.Â He misses his brother and often writes letters to Aron. He becomes lonesome and isolated.Â In his letters to Adam he writes about looking for a wife but instead only ends up frequenting the local inn, which houses prostitutes. Occasionally, he would move in âone slovenly woman after anotherâ but his interest in the women would quickly wane and he would then move them out (53).\n\nWhen Adam finally comes home to the farm after their fatherâs death, Charles is glad to have his brother around but the tension between the brothers never lessened. While the industrious Charles seeks to increase their land holdings and develop the family farm, Adam is restless and dissatisfied with farming. His desire to travel rather than stay in Connecticut agitates Charles and is a subject of their quarrels with each other. When Adam decides to take in Cathy, Charles instantly distrusts her and sees in her a darkness that he recognizes in himself. On Adam and Cathyâs wedding night, Cathy drugs Adam and shows up in Charlesâs bedroom and the two have sex. Although never proven, it is hinted that Charles could be the biological father of one or both of Adamâs twin boys. Throughout his adulthood, Charles stayed focused on running the farm and amassed great wealth; however, he never finds love or happiness. Of the Trask property Steinbeck writes, âIt was a grim farm and a grim house, unloved and unlovingâ (63). Upon his death, Charles left behind a $100,000 inheritance, which he willed to be split between Adam and Cathy. A note scribbled to Adam by one of Charlesâ lawyers indicated he died having lived a lonely and miserly existence.\n\nCathy Ames (Kate)\n\nCathy, one of Steinbeckâs most interesting and controversial characters, is born with what the author describes as âa malformed soulâ in a small Massachusetts town (71). From early on, people are both taken and betrayed by her innocent face. She often makes people feel uneasy, though they would not be able to say why. She learns at a young age how to use her sexuality to manipulate people and is a very clever liar. She is the cause of the whipping of two fourteen-year-old boys and the apparent suicide of one of her school teachers.Â As a teenager, she murders her parents by setting the familyâs home on fire while they slept. Though her body was never found, she too is presumed dead.\n\nEventually Cathy finds her way to Mr. Edwards in Boston for a job as a prostitute. Instead, stricken by her apparent innocence and beauty, he installs her as his mistress. Cathy tortures Edwards, who is obsessed with her, by stroking his jealousy and fears that she might abandon him.Â He later learns of the house fire and forces her to accompany him on a trip to Connecticut, where he nearly beats her to death. She crawls her way onto the Trask property where Adam finds her and nurses her back to health.\n\nShe marries Adam for protection, though she has sex with his brother Charles on her wedding night.Â Reluctantly she moves to California with Adam where she learns she is pregnant. She later intimates to Adam that Charles impregnated her.Â After a failed self-induced abortion, Cathy gives birth to twin boys.Â She endures her pregnancy as a trial and the birth is described as âbitter, deadly combatâ (187). Two weeks after the delivery, she packs her bags to leave the ranch. When Adam attempts to stop her, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nCathy then finds her way to Fayeâs brothel where she adopts the pseudonym Kate. Like others before her, Faye is fooled by Kateâs innocent face and beauty. She discourages Kate from prostitution and eventually begins to rely on her to run the brothelâs affairs. When Kate learns that Faye has left everything to her in her will, she concocts a subtle and devious plan to murder Faye.Â Once Faye is dead and Kate has inherited the house, she creates a brothel with a reputation for sexually depraved spectacles. She keeps the prostitutes in her employ cowed and hooked on drugs.\n\nEventually Kate is visited by Adam and both of her twin sons.Â The meetings, along with growing paranoia about the evil deeds of her past resurfacing, cause Kate to question herself.Â Having always been self-assured in her isolation from what she saw as great depravity in other people, she begins to wonder if perhaps it is she who is different.Â Particularly, her meeting with Aron, who is brought to her out of revenge by his angry and rejected brother, brings this fact into relief. âThey had something she lacked,â Cathy thinks to herself, âand she didnât know what it was. Once she knew this, she was ready; and once ready, she knew she had been ready a long timeâperhaps all her lifeâ (550). She was ready to kill herself, which she does, after willing her entire fortune to Aron.\n\nCaleb (Cal) Trask\n\nCal is one of Cathy and Adam Traskâs twin sons.Â Cal is described as âwatchfulâ and is darker of complexion and bigger and stronger than his fair skinned twin (333). Cal notices from an early age that people gravitate towards his innocent and angelic looking brother. As a result, he craves attention and often feels rejected, especially by his father. Cal possesses a cruel streak that contrasts sharply with his brotherâs gentle nature. While on one hand he loves his brother, on the other, he gets satisfaction from knowing he can manipulate Aron to cause him pain and confusion.Â Sometimes he feels a great desire to protect his more innocent brother. He is frightened by what he perceives as darkness inside of him, especially once he learns the truth about his mother. He worries it might be an inherited, permanent evil. He prays to God to remove the stain: âI donât want to be mean. I donât want to be lonelyâ (377). After learning about Cathy, Cal stalks her for a few weeks until she confronts him. When he finally comes face to face with his mother, Cal realizes where the darkness comes from and decides that he has the power to become a different person.\n\nLike his Uncle Charles, Cal craves love and attention from his father, whom he believes favors his brother.Â When Adam loses his fortune, Charles invests in a business deal with Will Hamilton during WW I and makes a $15,000 profit upon the great demand for beans. Cal presents the money to his father as a gift on Thanksgiving in front of Adam, Abra and Lee. Adam rejects the gift, refusing to take any money that was made in profit off of the war. Cal is completely devastated.Â In revenge, Cal takes Aron to see Kate. Consequently, Aron runs off and joins the military and is killed in battle only a few months later. Adams suffers a major stroke upon learning of his sonâs death.Â Cal, riddled with guilt, seeks out Abra who brings him back to his father.Â Ultimately, Adam blesses Cal with the word, timshel, indicating that there is a chance of redemption for Cal should he choose to triumph over the sins of his past.\n\nAron Trask\n\nAron is one of Cathy and Adam Traskâs twin sons.Â In comparison to his darker, brooding brother, Aron seems simple and innocent. People are taken by his pleasant countenance: âThe width between his blue eyes gave him an expression of angelic innocenceâ (333). Unlike the clever and suspicious Cal, Aron is trusting and kind. Though he hears suspicious remarks about his mother, he cannot reconcile the fact that his father might be a liar.\n\nWhile Cal craves the attention of his father, Aron desires the love of a mother figure.Â He allows his girlfriend, Abra, to mother him and admits to himself he experiences a âwordless longingâ for his mother (426). Perhaps, deep down, Aron blames his father for his angst, which could explain the intensity of the embarrassment he suffers after Adam loses the familyâs fortune in his failed attempt to transport refrigerated lettuce across the nation. Aron seems to become increasingly uncomfortable in his own skin after that incident and desires to finish school early and leave Salinas.\n\nIn the meantime, Aron turns to the church and becomes devoutly religious.Â He decides to become an Episcopalian minister and even contemplates a life of celibacy, much to Abraâs disappointment.Â His devout nature causes friction in his relationship with Abra, who feels she cannot live up to his expectations. Overtime, Abra comes to realize that Aron does not love her; rather, he loves an idealized version of her that exists only in his mindâjust as was the case with Adamâs love of Cathy. Aron also comes to harshly judge his brother Cal whom he sees as living a sinful life.\n\nAron is destroyed when confronted by the reality of Cathy. That the blood of a depraved prostitute runs in his veins is too much for him to bear. Though he is killed shortly after he runs away and joins the military, it is likely he experienced a more significant emotional or spiritual death after the confrontation. Readers are left to wonder if Aron would have ever been able to recover from the crushing blow had he survived the war.\n\nSamuel Hamilton\n\nSamuel Hamilton, a transplant from Northern Ireland, arrived in the Salinas Valley around 1870.Â Samuel is the bearded patriarch of a large family from which John Steinbeck is descended (139).Â Samuel unfortunately settles on dry, rocky ground and is never able to establish a successful farm. Through his ingenuity and industrious nature, he manages to eke out a meager living to support his wife and nine children.\n\nMore importantly than financial prosperity, however, Samuel Hamilton is respected and admired by nearly all those who know him.Â He has a sharp and inquisitive mind and possesses a great love for reading. His reading interests vary widely. He even buys a copy of William Jamesâ Principles of Psychology behind his wifeâs backâodd for an Irish immigrant farmer at the turn of the twentieth century. Steinbeck implies Samuelsâ tremendous intellectual curiosity and creativity make him special. He also passes his love of learning onto his children, who â[. . .] were better read and better bread than most of their contemporaries. To them Samuel communicated his love of learning, and he set them apart from the prideful ignorance of their timeâ (147). He has a knack for invention but not business and so loses many potentially great ideas to more savvy individuals.\n\nWhile Samuel never could get water to his own farm, he has a special gift for locating water in the valley. Samuel meets Lee and Adam Trask when Lee comes to fetch him to see if he can locate water on the old Sanchez ranch that Adam has purchased. He locates water using a special forked stick, which he refers to as his âmagic wandâ (165). When Adam inquires about how the stick works, Samuel explains it this way: âI donât really believe in it save that it works. [. . .] Maybe itâs this way. Maybe I know where the water is, feel it in my skin. Some people have a gift in this direction or that. Supposeâwell, call it humility, or a deep disbelief in myself, forced me to do a magic to bring to the surface the thing I know anywayâ (167).\n\nSamuelâs sensitive and intuitive nature makes him keenly perceptive about both natural phenomenon and the subtle psychology of the human mind. He sees similar tendencies in Lee, Adamâs servant, and so comes to greatly respect him. He recognizes the inhumanity of Cathy and is greatly grieved by her.Â He also immediately sees the faults in Adamâs worship of his wife and unattainable dream of creating a garden.Â Likewise, he knows the great damage Adam is doing to his sons after he falls into a hopeless stupor once Cathy deserts him.Â Samuel saves Adamâs sons twiceâonce by bringing them into the world and second by revealing the truth about Cathy to Adam to goad him into living again.\n\nThough Samuel dies half way through the novel, he remains an important influence throughout as his figure is frequently recalled by both Lee and Adam later in the story.Â Even Kate remembers the effect Samuel had on her. His presence resounds again at the very end of the novel when Adam blesses Cal with the word âtimshelâ since it was Leeâs explanation of the term and the resulting glory of humanityâs apparent freedom to exercise choice which drove Samuel to tell Adam about Cathy in the first place.\n\nLee\n\nLee is Adam Traskâs complex and interesting Chinese-American servant. Readers meet Lee when he goes to pick up Samuel to bring him back to the ranch to discuss boring wells with Adam.Â On the surface, Lee appears a stereotypical Chinese manservant, wearing a queue and speaking in pidgin Chinese.Â Within a few moments of meeting him and learning Lee was born in America, Samuel tells Lee, âI mean no disrespect, but Iâve never been able to figure out why you people still talk pidgin when an illiterate baboon from the back bogs of Ireland, with a head full of Gaelic and a tongue like a potato, learns to talk a poor grade of English in ten yearsâ (161). Lee and Samuel are great friends from that moment on.Â Lee explains he essentially hides behind a stereotypical Chinese mask since that is what the surrounding American culture expects from him.\n\nBehind the faÃ§ade, Lee is highly intelligent, thoughtful, well-read and kind. Rather than being humiliated by his position as a servant, he sees servitude as a unique position to exercise power over a master who comes to rely too heavily upon his servant.Â Lee, however, does not take advantage of this position. He ends up running Adamâs household and raising his twin sons while Adam languishes in his depression. Once Adam emerges from his stupor, Lee presents to him 10 years of carefully maintained accountsâevery household penny accounted for.\n\nBesides his role as surrogate father to the twins, Lee plays an important role in the novel by introducing the concept of âtimshel.âÂ When the twins are fifteen months old, Samuel descends upon the Trask property to force Adam to name his unclaimed and unloved sons. In the process, Samuel and Lee end up discussing the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Together they ponder the significance of the story, particularly that because Abel dies, all of humanity is descended from the banished murderer, Cain.Â Intrigued by contradictory translations of the wording in the story, Lee consults Chinese elders with whom he undertakes a study of Hebrew in order to translate the passage more accurately.\n\nLater in the novel, Lee explains his findings to both Adam and Samuel, who has come to bid the men farewell.Â In contrast to the two conflicting translations of the word timshelâone which orders Cain to triumph over sin (do thou triumph) and the other, which prophesies Cain will triumph over sin (thou shalt triumph), Lee and his elders conclude the word is most accurately translated as âthou mayest.âÂ Lee interprets the significance of the word in this manner: âBut âThou mayestâ! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight it through and winâ (301-02).\n\nLeeâs words have a tremendous impact on both Samuel and Adam.Â They immediately inspire Samuel to choose to reveal the truth about Cathy to Adam, which he hopes will force Adam to make a choice: get up and live or lay down and die.Â At the very end of the novel, we see the lasting impact the words have had on Adam.Â In the face of one of his sonâs death, at least implicitly at the hand of the other, Adam is able to bless Cal, who has struggled throughout his entire life to choose right over wrong, with the word âTimshel.â Essentially Lee saves Calâs life by not only presenting Adam with the material circumstance to bless Cal by bringing him in front of his father and forcing Adam to speak, but he has also presented Adam with the spiritual understanding he needs to help free Cal from the weight of his sins.\n\nAbra Bacon\n\nThe Trasks are first introduced to Abra Bacon and her family when Abra is 10 years old. Her family stops at the Trask ranch for shelter during a storm. Abra is intelligent and precocious. She seems much more mature than other girls her age. Later when Adam asks Cal Abraâs age, he replies, âNearly fifteen.Â But sheâsâwell, more than that some waysâ (453). Lee comments that she was born a woman. As a child, she is immediately drawn to the sweet and innocent Aron, which sparks Calâs jealousy and anger towards her and his brother. Though they are together for just a few moments, Aron and Abra decide they will be married some day.\n\nA few years later, the twins end up attending the same school as Abra once the Trasks move to Salinas. Abra and Aronâs relationship burgeons and Abra grows close to the Trask family, especially Lee, who eventually comes to see her as a daughter figure.Â He presents to her a jade button, his dead motherâs only ornament. Initially, Aron relies on Abra for much needed motherly affection.Â Later he begins to reject her affections as he becomes increasingly introverted and more devoted to the Episcopalian church.Â Abra struggles to be what Aron needs her to be, but as she matures, she realizes that Aron does not love her for who she actually is as a person, but rather he loves some idealized vision of Abra that exists only in his mind.\n\nAs the novel progresses, readers learn more about Abraâs family, which seems cold and unloving.Â As she does with Aron, Abra hides her true self from her mother and father.Â Her mother dresses her like a doll and orders all of her affairs. She tells Cal her father never loved her because he wanted a son, probably to name Abraham, which is why he named her âAbra.â\n\nAt the end of the novel, Abra tells Cal she no longer loves Aron.Â She accepts that she cannot live up to his expectations and that she is just as imperfect as Cal, who considers himself stained because of his family heritage. Abra says she is equally bad as she has discovered her father is a liar and thief who has embezzled money from his company.Â Abra finally achieves acceptance from the understanding Lee and Cal. She is instrumental in Calâs redemption at the end of the novel as it is she he goes to in his despair and she who forces him back to his fatherâs bedside.Â Together Abra and Lee save Cal from self-destruction.\n\nâ\n\nMinor Characters\n\nMrs. Trask\n\nMrs. Trask is Cyrusâ first wife and the unnamed mother of Adam. She considered herself to be deeply religious and believed that when bad things happened to her it was punishment from God. After she realized Cyrus had given her gonorrhea, she reasoned it was punishment for the illicit thoughts and dreams she had while Cyrus was awayâ her ânocturnal philanderingâ (15).Â She decides she needs to sacrifice herself to make amends and drowns herself in a pond.\n\nAlice Trask\n\nAlice lived on a farm neighboring Cyrus Traskâs property and is quickly married at age 17 to Cyrus just weeks after his first wifeâs death. She soon becomes pregnant and gives birth to Charles. She mostly busies herself with raising the boys, cooking and keeping the house clean. She rarely exhibits emotion and only smiles when she is alone. Only Adam ever catches a glimpse of her smiling and this causes him to long for the motherly affection he never received.Â We learn after Charles nearly beats Adam to death, she has secretly always loved Charles more. When Cyrus is away on military business, she is required to send regular reports to him about the household affairs. She keeps her letters short and to the point. She suffers from consumption but keeps her condition hidden, fearing Cyrusâs military discipline will subject her to a treatment that will likely kill her. She dies from consumption while Adam is away in the army.\n\nLiza Hamilton\n\nLiza is the practical, hard-working and devout wife of Samuel Hamilton. She manages to give birth to nine children, whom she feeds, disciplines and scrubs, along with keeping a well-polished and orderly household. Liza is unemotional and plain in her appearance.Â Above all, she places a firm and unwavering faith in God, whom she is certain shares all of her opinions: âIt was well known that Liza Hamilton and the Lord God held similar convictions on nearly every subjectâ (178). While she is disdainful of her husbandâs creative thinking, she cares for him and loves and respects his kindness.\n\nGeorge Hamilton\n\nGeorge is the oldest son of Samuel and Liza Hamilton.Â Gentle, polite and handsome, he was âa sinless boy who grew to be a sinless manâ (37). Eventually he marries and becomes an insurance salesman.\n\nWilliam Hamilton\n\nWill is the second son of Samuel and Liza Hamilton. Unlike his brother George, Will is âdumpy and stolidâ and very energetic (37).Â He marries a woman named Delia.Â Will develops an interest in business at an early age and has a knack for creating and investing in profitable ventures. He grows wealthy selling Fords and is politically and fiscally conservative. Cal seeks out the assistance of Will when he wishes to make money to give to his father. Together they invest in beans, which Will perceives will be in great demand with the outbreak of WW I. They both make a large profit off the venture. Later in the novel, and to Adamâs surprise, readers learn William is disdainful of his father for his failure to achieve financial success in life.\n\nTom Hamilton\n\nTom is the third son of Samuel and Liza Hamilton. He is lively and enthusiastic and likes to dream big. He inherited his fatherâs inventive nature but is more daring.Â He seems sensitive and is the victim of intense emotions, including a âdriving sexual need that made him remain a bachelorâ (39). He often experiences guilt over what he perceives as his excesses. Described by Samuel as âquavering over greatness,â his family members, especially his mother, are protective of his sensitive nature and apparent passivity (280). Unlike his brothers and sisters who eventually move away, he remains on the family farm.Â Eventually, feeling responsible for his sister Dessieâs death, he commits suicide.\n\nJoseph Hamilton\n\nJoe is the youngest son of Samuel and Liza Hamilton.Â He is âphysically lazyâ and considered \"the darling of the family\"(40).
