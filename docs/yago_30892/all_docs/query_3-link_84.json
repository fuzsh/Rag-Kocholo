        "text": "Do you have a soft spot for dragons, heavily armoured warriors wading into battle and wizards waving wands? If so, you’ll already know few genres are more stirring and exciting than fantasy. But while fantasy is hugely popular in written form, it has tended to receive short shrift on the small screen, especially compared to its spiritual sibling, science fiction.\n\nHow to explain this second-class status? One potential issue is the question of definition – what, after all, is fantasy? The most straightforward answer is that if something “feels” like fantasy, it probably is. For this countdown, we’ve adopted the rule of thumb that where a series gives off fantasy vibes and could potentially be enjoyed by someone who has negotiated The Lord of the Rings from beginning to end – even the songs and the appendices – then it makes the cut. Read on to learn more.\n\n20. The Wheel of Time (2021-present)\n\nThe 14 Robert Jordan doorstoppers from which WoT is adapted are considered one of the most definitive fantasy sagas ever written – bridging the gap between Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire. Prime Video’s take on the tale had an up-and-down debut in 2021 – but found its groove in its second series last year. Rosamund Pike heads the cast as Moiraine Damodred, a warrior nun searching for the mythical “Dragon” – a Messiah figure with the power to save or destroy humanity. It’s fantasy done the old fashioned way, with warring armies, orc-like “Trolloc” baddies and people with names such as al’Lan Mandragoran. Still, the books are beloved for a reason, and by the time the invading Seanchan armies turn up in series two, Prime Video has stumbled into capturing some of the majesty of the source material. Read our The Wheel of Time review\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\n16. Carnival Row (2019-2023)\n\nCara Delevingne is literally away with the fairies as she stars opposite Orlando Bloom in a steampunk thriller set in an alternative universe version of Victorian London, where magic is real and humankind lives alongside centaurs, fey and other mystical races. As a metaphor for race and class divisions, the show is surprisingly nuanced, and Delevingne put in her best performance yet as Vignette Stonemoss, which sounds like the name of a member of The Last Dinner Party but is, in fact, the moniker by which Delevingne’s faerie is known to humans. Bloom is a bit dreary as her former lover, Philo Philostrate, though his fantastic moustache compensates somewhat.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\n12. His Dark Materials (2019-2022)\n\nThe BBC/HBO tilt at the Philip Pullman children’s classic suffers the same flaws as the books in that the first series is by far the best and it all falls apart slightly in the end (the final novel descending into an atheist rant). But you can’t help but admire the world-building as we join young Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen), her shape-changing daemon Pantalaimon (a sort of furry, Freudian extension of her id) in an alternative Oxford where giant airships fill the sky, and people share stories of armoured polar bears in the far north. It also has Ruth Wilson in the role she was born to play – terrifying villain, Mrs Coulter. Read our His Dark Materials review\n\nWhere to watch: BBC iPlayer\n\n8. The Chronicles of Narnia (1988-1990)\n\nThe BBC’s late Eighties take on CS Lewis lacks the blockbusting budgets of the subsequent movies, and viewers will have to suspend their disbelief for the appearance of a moth-eaten Aslan made largely out of curtain fabric. But the adaptations of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (the latter two were combined into a single series), and The Silver Chair captured the eeriness threaded throughout the Lewis novels but which subsequent retellings have failed to pick up on. Look out for a former Doctor Who: Tom Baker plays depressed sidekick Puddleglum in The Silver Chair.\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube"
