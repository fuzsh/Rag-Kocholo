        "text": "During the 41-year (plus) run of All My Children, many famous movie and TV actors or other well-known folk, have either been asked to guest star on All My Children, or have asked the show for the opportunity/honor to guest appear in the program. And (not to be omitted) are those many actors who actually made their acting debut on this (MULTI) Daytime Emmy Award Winning Program. In 1984 we had the pleasure of meeting the daughter of Langley Wallingford, Verla Grubbs .... aka: Carol Burnett. I recall having laughed my way through many a Verla episode!\n\nTwo actors who got their start on All My Children during the 70s are Karen Lynn Gorney (the original Tara Martin Brent) and her on-screen love-interest, Richard Hatch (the original Philip Brent). Karen Lynn (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Lynn_Gorney), went on to star in the 1977 Blockbuster Disco Hit, Saturday Night Fever, alongside heart-throb, John Travolta. As a result of her believable enactment of her role in this movie pertaining to the Disco Era, she continued to star in a number of such Disco-Type Movies.\n\nRichard Hatch went on to star as Captain Apollo in the original Battlestar Galactica television show, as well as to play the part of Tom Zarek in the 2003 remake of Battlestar Galactica. You will find much more information of Richard Hatch, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hatch_(actor).\n\nThroughout the decades, many other AMC cast members went on to super-stardom ... at the start of the new millennium, it is very true that one. Joshua David \"Josh\" Duhamel wet his acting whistle within the walls of AMC, portraying the ever-so-endearing character, Leo Dupres. Others who also began their acting career within those same walls, I will discuss with you at a later date. I would, however, be remiss in not mentioning two of the original AMC cast mates, actors Ruth Warrick (as Phoebe Tyler Wallingford) and Mary Fickett (as Ruth Parker Brent Martin).\n\nRuth Warrick - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Warrick - was a quite famous actor for many years prior to TV ever becoming a piece of household furniture, making her film acting debut (as Emily Monroe Norton), alongside of world-renowned actor, Orson Wells, in the film -Citizen Kane-. Many years later, at her 80th birthday celebration, Ms Warwick attended a special screening of this Classic Film, to a packed, standing room only, audience. During her lifetime, Ruth Warrick collected a number of books related to Orson Welles and to Citizen Kane - and on the inside of each and every copy, she wrote: Property of Ruth Warrick, Mrs. Citizen Kane.\n\nA primed actor prior to acting in her long-running role as original Ruth Parker Brent Martin on All My children Mary Fickett made her 1946 theatrical debut in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This led her to leave for New York, NY - to make her 1949 Broadway debut (with starring actors Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne), in the live theater comedy, I Know My Love.\n\nFickett's television debut began in 1950s programs, such as the Kraft Television Theater, then on to her first feature film (with actor Bing Crosby!) being the 1957 movie, Man on Fire. In 1958, Mary Fickett won a Tony Award nomination in category of Best Featured Actress in a Play, for her role opposite Ralph Bellamy, in Sunrise a Campobello, continuing on in 1960s television, to be featured in (with host Harry Reasoner) Calendar, a forerunner to CBS' popular: The Early Show.\n\nIn January 1970, Mary Fickett attained the role as the original Ruth Parker Brent Martin, (1970-1996; 1999-2000), a nurse at the local hospital and wife of alcoholic car salesman Ted Brent. Her character quickly found an attraction to the widowed Dr. Joe Martin (Ray MacDonnell) and All My Children history was made with their adoption of abandoned Thaddeus (TAD) James Gardner (Matthew Anton 73-77, John E. Dunn 78-81, Michael E. Knight 82-86, 88-90, 92-2011, 2013, Terrell Anthony - temp replacement actor 1990).\n\n* SOURCE: Wikipedia\n\nPublic Domain Mark 1.0\n\n1984 Synopis\n\nFully recovered from his paralysis, a still-glum Greg Nelson believed he had lost Jenny forever, until the day he got his hands on her long waylaid declaration of love, which Enid had hidden. He raced to the church and burst into the ceremony. He charged up the aisle and punched out Tony right smack in the middle of the wedding ceremony, and demanded to speak with the bride.\n\n\"Your letter, Jenny. The letter that you wrote me telling me how you felt, Jenny. I didn't get that letter until today.\"\n\n\"What?''\n\n''They kept it from me. My mother, Amanda, and that jerk that you almost married.\"\n\n\"They kept it from you?\n\n\"Yes! Yes! Jenny, look at me. Now that I've read the letter, and now that I know how you feel, you have to know that I feel exactly the same way. Jenny, I never stopped loving you.\"\n\nFinally, with this incredible misunderstanding out in the open, Jenny and Greg could be together.... forever. Jenny and Greg married on Valentines Day, 1984. Vengefully, Tony plotted to kill Greg during the summer while Greg, Jenny and Tad were enjoying a midday retreat at a nearby lake. Tony hooked up a bomb to the engine of a jet ski which Greg had been eager to ride. Only Jenny, who decided to ride the jet ski first, was mortally injured in the explosion. Within hours, she was gone.\n\nErica was happily engaged to her new man, Mike Roy, but another newcomer, who would have a profound impact upon Erica's life, had arrived on the scene. Adam Chandler became instantly obsessed by the beautiful and alluring Erica Kane. Adam was the producer of a forthcoming movie, Raising Kane, based on Erica's autobiography.\n\nErica finagled a screen test to play herself -- but she was awful! Instead of Erica, Adam hired another actress, Danielle, to play Erica Kane. Meanwhile, Adam secretly plotted to play a role of his own -- Erica Kane's husband. To accomplish this, Adam arranged to have Mike Roy sent to Tibet. With Mike gone, Erica married Adam and moved into the Chandler mansion. Erica grew highly suspicious when she began hearing eery noises coming from the mansion's west wing. Adam was keeping a closely guarded secret -- he had an identical twin brother named Stuart living in the west wing!\n\nStuart hated Palmer Cortlandt, (who he knew as \"Pete Cooney\") enough to kill him because decades earlier, \"Pete\" had gotten Stuart and Adam's sister, Lottie, pregnant back in their home town, Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia. Before he knew she was pregnant, Pete was sent off to war. Lottie thought that \"Pete\" had deserted her. Suffering from a broken heart, a distraught Lottie took her own life. But she left behind \"Pete's\" legacy -- a son, Ross Chandler. To this day, the Chandlers carried a vendetta against Pete Cooney, who had risen above his humble beginnings and changed his name to Palmer Cortlandt.\n\nDivorced from Nina, Cliff Warner's troubles continued when his wild, flame-haired sister, Linda Warner, came to town, along with her lowlife boyfriend, Chris. Meanwhile, Nina became mesmerized by the phony healing abilities of a new arrival in town, Zach Grayson. Zach was a con artist who used to be a hustler on Locust Street. Donna knew him from her days on Locust Street. Marian Colby, Liza's mother, began to sleep with Zach.\n\nCleared of kidnapping their own child, Jesse and Angie Hubbard settled into married life with their infant son, Frankie. Along with Greg and Jenny, the Hubbards jointly decided to buy a restaurant/club called the Steampit. A pregnant Brooke left Tom after he and Erica had gotten drunk and slept together the night before Erica married Adam. Tom tried to get Brooke proven as an unfit mother before she even had the baby. Meanwhile, Brooke and Mark grew closer and Mark was with her the night her daughter Laura was born.\n\nTad was secretly being paid by Edna, Dottie's mother, to take Dottie out. Phoebe had taken a young girl named Hillary, Langley's daughter by a former wife, under her wing. Tad fell in love with college student Hillary. To hang on to Tad, Dottie threw away her birth control pills and became pregnant. Tad married Dottie, who miscarried , but didn't want to tell Tad. Meanwhile, a friend of Tad's, named Bob Georgia, fell in love with Hillary,\n\nEllen Dalton and Ross Chandler married. Attending the wedding was Ross' hateful former wife, Cynthia Preston, who, on Palmer's invitation, moved into Cortlandt Manor with her son, Andrew.\n\nTo test out his wife Erica's affections, Adam faked his own death. Erica had realized she was still in love with Mike and after Adam's \"death,\" got engaged to Mike. When Adam reappeared alive, Erica was furious. If she really wanted a divorce, Adam told Erica, she must choose between Adam's fortune and her love for Mike. She chose Mike.\n\nMeanwhile, Tad was unhappily married to Dottie, but truly loved Hillary. Hillary, destroyed by the shotgun marriage of the man she loved and her chief rival, turned to Tad's best friend, Bob Georgia, for comfort. When Tad finally discovered that Dottie was not pregnant, he was too late. Hillary was engaged to Bob Georgia, who was dying of a terminal illness that gave him just one year to live. Hillary was determined to fill Bob's waning days with happiness.\n\nTad served as best man at the wedding, and soon after, Bob made an amazing discovery - he was going to live! Realizing that this good news could mean the end of his marriage, Bob \"conveniently\" tried to keep the news from his wife, Hillary, but she found out and sued her husband for a divorce. Tad and Hillary were finally free to become man and wife.\n\n** Source: Unknown.
