Ruth's marriage to chief of staff Dr. Joe Martin provided the bedrock upon which the town of Pine Valley was built. Their marriage was always a stabilizing force that represented 'home' for many.\"\n\nBefore All My Children, Fickett starred alongside Bing Crosby in Man on Fire. She was also nominated for a Tony for her turn as Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello.\n\nSusan Lucci on early Erica Kane, All My Children without Agnes and Sarah Michelle Gellar\n\nFickett is survived by a daughter, a son, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nABC plans to dedicate the Wednesday, Sept. 21 episode to Fickett.
