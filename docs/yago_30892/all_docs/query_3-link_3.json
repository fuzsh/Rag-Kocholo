Is she in a nursing home or something? ?)\n\nI just started watching AMC again after years of watching Days. To be honest I just got bored of Days and started watching because of The Satin Slayer S/L. It was great!! I plan to stay with AMC for a long long tme now!!! :] :]\n\nI think it’s just pathetic that they would have a “Phantom actress” on the show like she was “actually in town and no one but Joe ever asks about her or visits her”. They never show Joe at home anymore and we used to see the inside of the house all the time. I heard someone say they thought she went to visit Tara and Brent. Well, this reminds me of that movie w/Johnny Depp called “Chocolat” The Mayor’s wife leaves town for supposidly a short visit and she’s gone for a yr. and he figures out SHE’s LEFT HIM!!! They should write something like that into the s/l so he can get on w/his life!!!\n\nQuote wilmahpj: last time i heard about Ruth was at Dixie's funeral when Joe said she wanted to be there but she wasn't feeling well\n\nThey could’ve just got an actress with her back to the camera to say … Ruth’s over there talking with so and so. She’s a NURSE HELLLLLOOOOOO how would the common cold keep her down. I worked in the medical profession. I went to functions and if it was my daughter in law that came back from the DEAD and now is DEAD then I’d do everything in my power to atleast show my back at the funeral for something to reference. The writers truly dropped the ball here. JMO.\n\nThank you all! I had wondered about her! That’s really strange She used to be a major chacter on AMC!\n\nWell maby TPTB will bring her back sometime soon.\n\nQuote soapnut619:\n\nQuote Joshlover: I think it's just pathetic that they would have a \"Phantom actress\" on the show like she was \"actually in town and no one but Joe ever asks about her or visits her\".

Maybe the writers can find a new one.I think the original \"Ruth\" died a while back.\n\nU know… That’s what I thought about how she passed away! You’re the first person other than myself, I have found on here who have heard that. I wonder if they just never replaced her character because she was going to be phased out or what?! You never know from day to day w/the soaps anymore!"
