I don't think that is Right. I Do Know that Erica was out of High School before She Met Jeff Martin who had come from Stanford to Work at Pine Valley Hospital. Erica Met Jeff at A Dance. I Also Know that I was Watching Jeff's Trial and Philip and Tara and then They had Ann and Nick Talking on A Pay Phone. I think that Ann had been in A Car Accident and Nick went to Help Her. They had Not had Ann and Nick Before and I didn't know who these People were. This was in 1973 so Nick was Not one of the Original People. I think that we didn't know Ann or Lincoln and I think we found out that Phoebe was their Step Mother and Not Their Real Mother. I think that Phoebe was Charles Second Wife. Lincoln was in Seattle and then He came to Pine Valley. I think we found out that Chuck's Father was Killed I think in A Car Accident or Possibly A Plane Crash. Chuck is Phoebe's Grandson. I think the Original People were Erica, Phoebe, Joe, Ruth and Mona. All they have Left is Erica and Joe. Once in A While They have Lee Meriwether being Ruth, but Ruth was Originally Played by Mary Fickett. Jody"
