Mangler\n\nDouglas A. “Doug” Mangler, age 70, of Wyoming, IA, completed his earthly journey suddenly on August 17, 2024, at home. To honor Doug’s life, a private family service will be held at a later date. The Tri-State Cremation Center is humbly serving Doug’s family.\n\nDoug was born on May 25, 1954, in Manchester, IA, a son to Eldon W. and Wanda C (Tilp) Mangler. He was a good and decent man through and through and for those who knew him well, they are also fully aware that he could be a bit of a spit-fire when the situation required such a response. In his younger year, Doug’s affinity for spending time with family and friends while tinkering on his latest vehicles became quite obvious. As children, he and his brother, Dennis spent countless hours tuning and upgrading their go-kart until they had the perfect machine at the ready. Doug carried this love for fixing up his Harleys and cars throughout his entire life and many projects were completed due to his determination, skills, and knowledge.\n\nDoug was a truck driver by trade and faithfully devoted many years of his career with the Dodge Trucking Company in Wyoming, IA. He always enjoyed putting a few miles under his belt and never regretted making a few good friends along the way as well. In his free-time, you could easily find Doug showing off his talents around the pool table, or spending a little quality time with his favorite canine companion, Roxy. Doug did his best not to take life too seriously, nor himself for that matter, and those around him truly benefited from his kind and generous spirit in more ways than we could count. We will miss Doug moving forward, and life will not be the same without his physical presence walking among us. Thank you, Doug, for reminding us that life is a journey to be walked on each path as we see fit and may this mode of operation also be present in our lives whenever possible. We are grateful for the time that we had and the memories which remain and only pray that Doug is free now from his earthly health battles and resting in the loving arms of the Lord until we all meet again.\n\nThose left behind to cherish the memory of Doug include,\n\nhis children,\n\nSarah (fiancé Brian Yeo) McNamara, Dubuque, IA,\n\nDrew Mangler, Savanna, IL,\n\nParker Mangler, Dubuque, IA,\n\nand step daughter Bailey (Ryan) Kloft, Bellevue, IA;\n\nhis grandchildren,\n\nMason Schlecht, Adalynn Yeo, Croix Yeo, and Pruitt Yeo;\n\nhis brother,\n\nDavid (Michael) Mangler, Lewes, Delaware;\n\nhis ex-wife and special friends,\n\nKelly (Will) Connor, Savanna, IL;\n\nalong with numerous extended family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nDoug was preceded in death by his parents; his daughter, Brandi Mangler; and his brothers, Eldon R. (Dick) Mangler, and Dennis Mangler.\n\nDoug’s family would like to thank all of our family and friends who have offered your love and support during this difficult time. Please know that we truly appreciate each and every one of you.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a Douglas A. Mangler memorial fund has been established.\n\nOnline condolences may be shared with Doug’s family at www.tristatecremationcenter.com\n\nMary E.

Click here to view the Mass of Christian Burial for Mary Althaus.\n\nMary was born on September 27, 1950 in Dubuque, daughter of John and Ruth (Peters) Ludescher. She graduated from Wahlert High School and attended Clarke College. She worked for the Iowa State Liquor Commission, Family Beer & Liquor, and she and her husband, Harry, opened Alt’s Mini Storage.\n\nMary was an animal whisperer her entire life, raising beloved dogs, taming feral cats lucky enough to find her, and keeping bird feeders filled with special seed for backyard songbirds. She was a nature lover at heart.\n\nIn 1992, Mary married the love of her life, Harry. The two were the true definition of opposites attract and were a perfect couple. Together they collected a wonderful group of friends and family, and were a welcome addition at gatherings. The two spearheaded special events like the grand Easter egg hunt/kegger enjoyed by dozens of friends, family and coworkers. Mary painstakingly stuffed hundreds of plastic eggs with coins and Betty Jane candy, and kids would spill into the yard on Gardners Lane, to fill their baskets and enjoy the company of everyone who gathered. Mary was a memory maker.\n\nMary was notoriously frugal yet quietly generous to family, friends, and causes dear to her. She was an active volunteer and board member for Dubuque Sertoma Club, Albrecht Acres, and Holy Ghost/St. Donatus parishes. Until the very end of her life, she was genuinely interested in the lives of others. She was a keen listener and friend to all.\n\nShe is survived by her beloved husband, Harry, and step-daughter Mikayla (Matthew) Slimmer; her brother, John “Jack” (Barb) Ludescher, and by her nephews and nieces: Mark (Vonnie) Ludescher; Chris (Heidi) Ludescher; Tom Ludescher (Sandy); Susan (Steve) LeFevre; and also many great and great great nieces and nephews; in-laws DiAnn (Terry) Rooney, Dennis (Jean Ann) Althaus, Roger (Sharon) Althaus, Linda Weretka, Rick (Pat) Althaus, Kevin (Joanie) Althaus, and their families.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, brother Jimmy, a sister-in-law Judi Bartel, brother-in-law Herb Althaus Jr, mother & father-in-law Herb Sr. & LeVon Althaus.\n\nThe family gives special thanks to the caring staff at Mercy Hospital 3W and ICU at University of Iowa Hospital.\n\nA memorial fund has been established to benefit Mary‘s favorite charities: Camp Albrecht Acres, Stonehill Communities, & St. Donatus Church.\n\nKorey L.

He was always on the lookout for anyone he could encourage to come meet the animals available for adoption. If you didn’t know Korey personally, you may know him as the dog walker in downtown Dubuque. Many thought he was providing a service, but he was actually just walking his and Jenny’s own dogs wherever they would take him.\n\nHe was a lifelong Chicago Cubs, Iowa Hawkeye and Chicago Bears fan and watching the Cubs win the World Series was a cherished memory that he spoke about often.\n\nKorey was a huge fan of graphic novels, movies of all kinds, especially horror and superhero movies, and professional wrestling. He recently was very proud and excited to be an extra in a short film his niece Kloie asked him to be a part of. It snowed terribly the day of filming but there was no way he was going to miss his big break.\n\nA kid at heart, “Uncle Korkey” adored spending time with his nieces and nephews. He was an expert claw machine operator and won many toys and trinkets over the years to share with the kids. He may also have been known to have a stash of candy under his bed that pieces were stolen from. He praised wins and listened to struggles and was always ready to share how proud he was of each of them.\n\nKorey had a razor sharp, lightning quick sense of humor, earning him the nickname “Time Bomb” in school. He also had a huge kind heart and a sweet soul like none other.\n\nKorey was king of the “midwest goodbye” but he was taken from us much, much too soon.\n\nKorey is survived by his wife Jennifer and their dog Ruby, mother and father Gary and Debra, sisters Kelly (Morgan) Eitter and Keri Breed; mother and father-in-law, Dennis and Mary Anne Barry, sister-in-law Kathryn Ties and brother-in-law James Barry, and former brother-in-law Miles Breed; nieces and nephews Kolton Nadermann, Briehlyn Nadermann, Madlin Nadermann (Teo Razic), Lt. Keegan Eitter, Kloie Eitter, Gavin Breed and Cooper Ties, great-nieces and nephew Leo, Mila, Veda and Nadalia.

Nadermann memorial fund will be established. Contributions can also be made to the Dubuque Regional Humane Society toward the adoption fee of an animal.\n\n“We are reminded how short life really is, and how we are just passing through. So, all the people you haven’t told you love lately, tell them, and live your days like you mean it.” – Hal Sutton\n\nMary Jane Anthony\n\nMary Jane (Janie) Anthony, 93, of Holy Cross, died on Sunday, August 18 at Mercy One Senior Care in Dyersville Iowa.\n\nVisitation will be held from 4-7 p.m. on Friday, August 23, 2024 at Kramer Funeral Home in Holy Cross.

Rev. Tyler Raymond will officiate.\n\nMary Jane was born on February 25, 1931, to Peter and Catherine (Meyer) Gotto of Bankston. On November 8, 1958, Mary Jane (Gotto) married James Anthony at St. Clements Catholic Church in Bankston. They farmed together for 31 years and raised a family in Holy Cross before Jim passed away in 1990. Janie then continued to farm with her three sons until retirement. You could find her doing chores, cooking, baking, or just having a long talk with friends or family. If you stopped by the farm or were over for a holiday, you never went away hungry or without a good cup of coffee. If you were out to lunch with her, you’d probably see her enjoying her favorite banana or coconut cream pie because it was always just fine to have dessert first. Janie also had a love of God, and her rosary was never far out of reach. She enjoyed endless conversations with family and friends along with shopping excursions where she may have purchased another polka dot shirt or fuzzy booties. And, during the good ‘ole days with her parents Pete and Kate in Bankston – endless Sundays were spent on the front porch visiting, cooking up an old-fashioned meal, or playing a good game of cards.\n\nJanie is survived by her three sons, Rick, Randy and Dave all of Holy Cross, her two daughters, Debra (husband David Young) of Katy, Texas and Peg (fiancé Korey Kahl) of Mazomanie, Wisconsin. She is further survived by brother Ralph (Nancy) of Minnesota, in-laws: Geri Anthony, Carol Anthony, Jane Anthony, numerous nieces & nephews, and extended family.\n\nJanie was preceded in death by her husband Jim, her parents, along with two brothers Leon (Grace) Gotto and Cletus (Rosella) Gotto, in-laws: Mel Anthony, Herb Anthony, Bill Anthony, Jack (Doris) Anthony, Charlie Anthony, Merlin Anthony, and Doris (Walter) Pitz.\n\nHer children know that heaven gained an angel, but she was already that on earth. Today, there’s the sweet smell of apple pie floating in heaven and coffee brewing, and a home cooked meal being shared with family and friends that have gone before her. The cards are being dealt for a game of horse deal or euchre, there’s chatter in the air, and heaven is a whole lot brighter because of Janie and her sweet soul. And, after a long 34 years, Jim and Janie are finally reunited. Until we meet again Mom, watch over us.\n\nThank you to the caregivers at Mercy One Senior Care for taking such wonderful care of Janie. Your dedication to your profession is priceless.\n\nKramer Funeral Home in Holy Cross is assisting the family and information is available at www.kramerfuneral.com.

Freebolin\n\nMelba E. Freebolin, age 91, of Dubuque, IA, formerly of Chicago, IL, completed her earthly journey on July 31, 2024, at Ennoble Manor in Dubuque, while surrounded by her loving family. To honor Melba’s life, her Memorial Service will be held at 10:00 a.m., on Saturday, August 31, 2024, at the First Congregational United Church of Christ, 225 West 10th Street in Dubuque, with Pastor Kaity Kemp officiating. Family and friends of Melba are invited to join in fellowship for one hour prior to the service at the church. Entombment will be in the First Congregational United Church of Christ Mausoleum. The Tri-State Cremation Center is humbly serving Melba’s family.\n\nMelba was born on May 19, 1933, in Oak Park, IL, a daughter to Oscar and Elizabeth (Edwards) Frick. She was raised to possess a strong devotion to family which she continued to carry proudly throughout her entire life. Melba also had a natural ability to teach others and meet them right where they were in all circumstances. She was an elementary school teacher for many years, but eventually Melba found her greatest joy was to be found in devoting her time and talents with the blind society. She made many wonderful friends and built long-lasting relationships along the way and always understood that her impact on the world around her was all so real and very tangible.\n\nMelba enjoyed her time away from work as well and over the years always found time to fit traveling and camping with her loved ones into her busy schedule. Whether it was touring out west, or simply settling into a more local campground for the weekend, Melba treasured the downtime while surrounded by those who were dear to her heart. She was also blessed with a little time to spend with her cross stitch needle in hand and a few of her beautiful creations remain today to help those left behind to remember the quiet and simple moments when Melba found both contentment and joy. She will also be fondly remembered for her love of music playing in the background whenever possible. Too much Johnny Cash was never going to be an issue and any chance to relax and refresh the day was always a welcomed event. Melba was always fun to be with. She was humorous and was always there for a good laugh. We are going to miss our dear sweet Melba’s physical presence in our daily lives moving forward, but we know that she fought the good fight and her eternal rewards were merely awaiting her earthly body to surrender her brilliant soul over to the Lord’s hands. Thank you, Melba, for leading by example, leaving behind a legacy of love, and for always reminding us that family and friends are truly a gift in this life and to be appreciated and honored at every opportunity. May the Lord bless you and keep you in His grace-filled arms until we meet again.\n\nThose left behind to cherish the memory of Melba include,\n\nher loving son,\n\nFredrick “Fred” (Jill) Freebolin, Dubuque, IA;\n\nher adored granddaughter,\n\nMcKenna (fiancé Anthony “Tony” Griebel) Freebolin, Bellevue, IA;\n\nher nieces,\n\nMarcia and Maureen Wilsey;\n\nher nephew,\n\nMarcus (Kathy Ocher) Wilsey;\n\nher grandnieces,\n\nJenna Brown and Dana (Chris) Bokhari;\n\nher grandnephew, Zachary Brewer;\n\nalong with numerous extended family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nMelba was preceded in death by her parents; her brother, James Frick; and her sister, Elizabeth (Jack) Wilsey.\n\nMelba’s family would like to thank the nurses and staff at Ennoble Manor and Care Initiatives Hospice for all of their professional and compassionate care.\n\nOnline condolences may be shared with Melba’s family at www.tristatecremationcenter.com\n\nBonny D.
