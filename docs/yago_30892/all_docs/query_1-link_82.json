        "text": "Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin still appear to be “going strong” following a confusing relationship report.\n\nOn June 29, the 34-year-old actor was seen supporting her rumored fiancé as the 47-year-old Coldplay frontman headlined the Glastonbury Festival in the UK. According to screenshots shared by The Daily Mail, Johnson was seen watching Martin’s performance from Pyramid Stage’s friends-and-family viewing area alongside Martin’s children, Apple and Moses, whom he shares with ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nHonestly, this spotting shouldn’t come as a surprise, despite their rare public appearances as a couple, considering they’ve been together since 2017. In fact, a source told People in March that the pair “got engaged years ago but were in no rush to get married.” That same month the Madame Web star casually referred to Moses as her “stepson,” telling Bustle, “I love those kids like my life depends on it. With all my heart.”\n\nHowever, a source shared a confusing update a few months later. “They’ve had ups and downs, but now they’re definitely back on,” the source told People in June, noting that the pair are currently “going strong.”\n\nIt’s unclear when the couple were on the outs, considering the pair were spotted together in Mexico in February. Dakota Johnson then described Martin as her “favorite being” in that same Bustle interview published in March, saying she “could watch him” perform “every day.” She continued, “I don’t know how to explain it. I feel like, I don’t know... I’m watching my most favorite being do his most favorite thing.\"\n\nAnd while she clearly's certainly close with Martin’s kids, Johnson also said she’s “so open” to having children of her own. “I’ve gotten to this place where I really want to experience everything that life has to offer. And especially being a woman, I’m like, What a magical fucking thing to do. What a crazy, magical, wild experience.” She then added, “We’re not here for very long, so if I’m meant to be a mother, bring it on.”"
