        "text": "DOC Martin's idyllic Cornish location is enough to make anyone want to up sticks to the coast - particularly its ITV cast.\n\nActor Joe Absolom, 43, who plays restauranteur Al Large in the hit comedy drama, re-located to the stunning surroundings 14 years ago.\n\nBut while the location made for the ideal Doc Martin filming commute for the show cast member - as well as a stunning spot for holidays - there was a darker reason for his family's big move.\n\nThe dad of three, who is married to wife Liz Brown, told how their decision came around after a burglary at his south London home while he was away filming.\n\nHis spouse was at home with their kids at the time.\n\nAnd following news of yet another tragic murder in London, Joe made the decision to move the family when eldest daughter Lyla was five.\n\nHe said: \"I remember sitting on the beach in Cornwall with Lyla on a day off from filming.\n\n\"She was asking where the tide had gone. I made up some sort of hare-brained father’s explanation.\n\n\"We drove back to London the next day and unfortunately a teenager had just been murdered outside our local supermarket.\n\n\"There were lots of floral tributes and my daughter said, 'what does RIP mean?' Within hours we’d gone from talking about where the tide goes to what RIP means.\"\n\nJoe, who moved to the picture-perfect Port Isaac, added: \"I’m not saying London is awful and that there’s no crime in Cornwall, but the idea of going to the beach and jumping in the sea whenever I want, or going for a run along the coast path, really appealed.\n\n\"My children’s lives are in Cornwall now.\n\nDaisy was born here – she’s got clotted cream in the blood.\"\n\nJoe also shares son Casper, 11, with Liz.\n\nHe shot to fame in the 90s plays Matthew Rose in EastEnders.\n\nHe has also had roles in The Bill, Dangerfield and Silent Witness.\n\nJoe also played chief suspect and local taxi driver Christopher Halliwell in true crime drama A Confession."
