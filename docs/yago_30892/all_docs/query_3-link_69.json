        "text": "By Max Murray\n\nFirst published: UK: Michael Joseph, 1952\n\nPresumably, that’s my old school mentioned in Chapter 8. The Right Honourable Corpse, you see, is set in my hometown, Canberra, ‘the bush capital’, so places I’ve known most of my life get a guernsey: Civic, Red Hill, Mt. Stromblo (sic), Ainslie, Duntroon, and Yass.\n\nBut the Canberra described in these pages – “remote and small”, “this city that was not a city at all”; population 15,000, “and most of them government servants, each with at least one eye on his neighbour” – is not the city I know.\n\nAustralia (pop. 8 million then) was younger, brasher, less sophisticated in the 1950s, certainly much less multicultural. (It’s striking how white all the characters are, and how there aren’t any First Nations people – Ngunnawal or Ngambri.)\n\nCanberra even more so. Barely a quarter of a century old when Murray wrote his book – founded in 1913, but not really built until the 1920s – Canberra was a country town (even a paddock) with a parliament in it. As Prince Philip said when he and the late Queen visited here in 1954, Canberra was “seven suburbs in search of a city”. My own suburb (indeed, the whole of the Woden Valley, let alone Tuggeranong, Belconnen, and Gungahlin) had not been built in those days, nor had the national institutions. In fact, Canberra didn’t even become self-governing until 35 years later.\n\nEven in the late ’90s, when I returned from Brussels, Canberra seemed a town rather than a city. There were few degrees of separation: half the people in my class were sons of people my father had worked with, while my English teacher and, later, my French lecturer knew my parents socially.\n\nThese days, Canberra is heading for half a million; it is that city that Murray very dimly envisaged 70-odd years ago, when Canberra was “not a city but a sprawling promise of the future, a splash of sophistication in the virgin bush”. Earlier this year, Oxford Economics named Canberra the second-best city in the world for quality of life.\n\nHistorical interest aside, Murray’s own detective story is rather small beer. Or poisoned tea. A Flower is untimely plucked: Rupert Flower MP, the powerful Minister for Interior Resources, drinks his cuppa, and carks. It is as much a romance novel with mystery elements as it is a whodunnit. There is not enough plot to sustain a story even of 150 pages; the crime is under-investigated while Murray describes Peggy Ann’s relations with three men: farmer Bill Flower, the victim’s nephew; enigmatic Martin Gilbert, pianist and spy; and her brother Shannon, implicated in bribing a public servant. Murray, I felt, could have done much more with the political setting and, indeed, with Canberra itself. Oddly, one doesn’t get much sense of Canberra as a place: the action takes place at Flower’s house, the US Embassy, a hotel, a farm, and the bush. And half the cast are Americans. Whodunit is quite evident several chapters before the revelation, and there’s no cleverness to it.\n\nA modern mystery set in Canberra would certainly be grittier and more political. The city’s growth has brought a slew of problems: its infrastructure has not kept pace with its population growth, resulting in soaring poverty (one-fifth of the population, or some 40,000 people, lives below the poverty line); homelessness (900 children, according to a report published this week); astronomically high rent and unaffordable housing; an overburdened community sector on the verge of collapse; plummeting education standards; a health system bursting at the seams; and overcrowded prisons. Now, there’s material for a crime novel.\n\nBlurb\n\n1952 Michael Joseph\n\nRupert Flower, Australia’s Minister for Interior Resources, had made many bitter enemies during his political career, and when, during the course of an evening party at his official residence, the Right Honourable gentleman was found slumped over his desk, a very dead corpse, the suspects were many. His wife, the beautiful Roma, seemed to be holding back something; her sponging, good-for-nothing brother, Major Lockwood, became pompous and protested too much; Martin Gilbert, though at the time he had been playing the piano (the star attraction of the party), appeared to know more than he told. And surely young Bill Flower stood to profit by his uncle’s death, yet he had fled into the bush and Peggy Ann Kilpatrick rode boldly after him.\n\nHere, against the background of the diplomatic circles of Canberra and the wild bush country of Australia, is a pretty mystery; and Max Murray unfolds his ingenious plot with the excitement, and the dexterity and pleasant wit always associated with his ‘corpses’.\n\nMax Murray’s debut in crime (with The Voice of the Corpse in 1948) was described by The Illustrated London News as ‘not only a delight but an event’. Of his last book, The Neat Little Corpse, Maurice Richardson in The Observer said, ‘he is writing better than ever’. Need we say more?\n\nOther reviews\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald (J. J. Q., 5th July 1952): Previous stories in the “Corpse” series were staged in London, on ship-board, in the West Indies and in Ruritania. The scene of this one is Canberra, “not a city but a sprawling promise of the future, a splash of sophistication in the virgin bush”.\n\nThere, the Rt. Hon. Rupert Flower, Internal Resources Minister, “more important than the Prime Minister, more trusted and more hated … vain and vindictive”, was poisoned to music provided at his wife’s reception of distinguished guests in the next room.\n\nThe pianist was Martin Gilbert, whose art covers his activities as spy and counter-spy in the Security Service.\n\nMartin investigates, with the approval of the Security Chief, shrewd, crusty. Sir David Reynolds, ex-Judge, who looks like a family lawyer.\n\nThe regular police inspector, accusing him of theft and blackmail, raids his lodgings, but he follows his own line in an inquiry that involves the American Ambassador’s son and daughter, the dead man’s relations, and high civil servants.\n\nThe solution is skilfully postponed by clouds of shifting suspicion. The dialogue is crisp and pertinent and the enigmatic Michael has a generous share of what the Jacobean jest-book calls “merry quirks and quick answers”.\n\nThe Courier-Mail (Stewart Harris, 6th September 1952): Murder at Canberra\n\nWhatever our thoughts on Canberra Cabinet Ministers we’d probably think it unsporting to poison any… Which makes Max Murray’s latest thriller so vicariously satisfying.\n\nSomebody kills Australia’s Minister for Internal Resources. Hence The Right Honourable Corpse.\n\nDiplomatic circles, official spokesmen, inspired sources, and other natives of the Canberra tribe make excellent suspects. Background is well drawn, writing adult, humour dry. Altogether, a distinguished bit of mystery.\n\nThe corpse is discovered while it should have been playing host at a party given by its wife. At once we meet the characters: the wife, beautiful and much younger, the brother-in-law, apparently a pompous dipso, the nephew, a decent youngster from the country, the American Ambassador and his daughter—\n\nAnd, best of all, a cynical, vastly bored young pianist who instructs his even younger pupil after this manner:\n\n“Now make a noise on that piano, almost any noise will do. I’m going to put my head out of the window.”\n\nOnce again, this is a honey of a corpse.\n\nThe West Australian (18th October 1952): The Right Honourable Corpse (Max Murray) has a Canberra background and the corpse is that of a fictitious Minister for Internal Resources, who was found slumped over his desk. There are many suspects including the wife, her soldier brother, a musician, and a nephew who bolted into the bush. The setting gives opportunities for fine descriptive writing while the plot is ingeniously untangled. Max Murray is one of Australia’s successful novelists.\n\nA Catalogue of Crime (Barzun & Taylor, 1989): A good locale and considerable versatility of prose and plotting keep the thing going despite weak motives and mechanics. One gets a little tired of the pianist-secret-agent hero, who goes out of his way to make everyone hate him for his “cynicism”. Yet there is enough in the tale to inspire a wish to see the earlier works.\n\nOther reviews"
