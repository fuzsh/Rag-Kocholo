        "text": "Oh, baby! Married to Medicine friend Audra Frimpong has some big news to share. Audra has confirmed exclusively to The Daily Dish that she is pregnant. And she’s revealing all the sweet details about expecting her second child and how her pals in the Married to Medicine cast recently came together to fete her big news.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Heavenly Kimes, Anila Sajja, and Quad Webb all gathered to celebrate Audra at a baby shower. Audra recently spoke with The Daily Dish about the shower, hosted by Dr. Heavenly, and spilled more tea about her pregnancy (she’s due in October); how her partner, Martin, is handling it all; and how she’s prepping to become a mom again (she already has a son, Kingston). BTW, in the video at the top of this post, Audra shares even more about her life and (now growing) family!\n\nThe Daily Dish: Congrats on the big news! How are you prepping for the baby?\n\nAudra Frimpong: First things first—NESTING! I have been in nesting mode since I hit the 30-week pregnancy mark. I remember having a talk with Martin and his cousin Christian, and Christian made a comment that the baby will be here in two months. That instantly freaked me out, and I have been busy ever since. We started prepping by creating a nursery and arranging our home in a way that is functional for a new baby. For example, I now have a utility cart next to my bed with wipes, diapers, and all other baby essentials for late-night changes and feedings.\n\nThe Daily Dish: Who is more nervous, you or Martin?\n\nAudra: I am definitely more nervous than Martin. He is a very cool, calm, and collected man, so he knows he will be able to handle any situation that arises. I am mostly nervous about the actual delivery. I had an emergency C-section with Kingston and that was a traumatic experience. I am hoping and praying for a VBAC, but either way, I am nervous about the fact that the baby has to exit my body either surgically or vaginally.\n\nThe Daily Dish: Do you know if you’re having a boy or girl? Have you picked baby names?\n\nAudra: We’re having a baby…BOY! Martin is the only man in his family for three generations, so he truly believed we were having a baby girl. I wasn’t sure what we were having until I had a dream that told me it was a boy. And I was right! ... The name picked itself, Martin Curry III.\n\nThe Daily Dish: Does this pregnancy feel different from when you were pregnant with Kingston?\n\nAudra: Pregnancy at age 23 is very different from pregnancy at age 32. My pregnancy with Kingston was very easy! I had so much energy and felt like myself until the very end. This pregnancy, however, has been taxing! I was nauseous and sleepy my entire first trimester. I finally had some relief during my second trimester, but when the third trimester came about, my hips, pelvis, and body started to hurt. It’s been rough. Also, I have learned that pregnancy during the summer is not ideal. Getting bigger while in 90-degree weather was a lot. And I also missed all mimosa opportunities [laughs].\n\nThe Daily Dish: What have you learned about pregnancy and motherhood over the years?\n\nAudra: I learned that each pregnancy is different. I definitely went through pregnancy blindly the first time around. This pregnancy, I have been educating myself on my growing baby and options for labor and delivery. A major thing I’ve learned about motherhood over the years is the importance of structure and routines. Life is easier for the parents and the children when all parties know what to expect.\n\nThe Daily Dish: How is Kingston feeling about the baby news?\n\nAudra: Kingston is so excited to be a big brother. He is a very responsible little guy, so he has been taking this big brother role very seriously. He has informed all his teachers and friends that he is going to have a little brother, and he has made it clear that he will be a helpful hand to Martin and me. He has also taken such a leadership role in the house since I have been pregnant. He packs his own school lunch, does his laundry, and takes every opportunity to help me out so I can relax.\n\nThe Daily Dish: How do you balance motherhood and maintaining a busy career [as a lawyer]?\n\nAudra: I have an all-hands-on-deck approach to being a working mother. Google Calendar has been our saving grace. I used to keep all of our plans and schedules in my brain, but it was so overwhelming. So my family and I utilize Google Calendar to know what’s ahead. I appreciate the free brain space.\n\nThe Daily Dish: How do you and Martin make sure you find time for each other, especially now that you’re expecting?\n\nAudra: Martin and I are big on date nights. We are very intentional about going on weekly dates, having dinner together each night as a family, and having unplugged conversations at night. Since I have gone on maternity leave, I go to Martin’s practice and eat lunch with him and bring a little joy to his workday. We love spending time together. We’re still in our honeymoon phase, so we are obsessed with being in each other’s presence as much as we can.\n\nThe Daily Dish: So give us all the details on the baby shower.\n\nAudra: Martin came up with the theme “Baby Martin from the Chocolate Factory,” a play on Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. We really wanted it to be family reunion–style where all of our family and friends come together to eat, drink, and celebrate the newest little chocolate drop entering the world.\n\nI had many talks with Heavenly about the vision for the shower, and she graciously opened her home to all of our guests. We worked with an event decorator, Events That Sparkle, and they truly brought the vision to life. Heavenly’s backyard is already gorgeous, so we just wanted to elevate the space to match our theme, and the design team did just that. We had a dessert cart with tasty little treats and delicious barbecue food from The Brunch Trap. Since it was a family-friendly event, we had an amazing face painter, Bubble Squad Entertainment, who painted all the kids’ faces.\n\nThe Daily Dish: What were some of your favorite moments?\n\nAudra: I didn’t have one specific favorite moment. I just love gathering with the people I love to celebrate such a beautiful time in life.\n\nThe Daily Dish: How has Dr. Heavenly been supporting you through your pregnancy?\n\nAudra: Dr. Heavenly is the self-proclaimed — but now actual — godmother of Baby Martin! She always checks in on me and “her baby.” She is ready to take him in! She has been giving me tips on labor and encouraging me to stay healthy during pregnancy by eating healthy foods and going on walks. Although she did give me oxtails and rice one day, and Dr. Jackie [Walters] was very upset. But ultimately, I am positive she will be an amazing godmother. Now that I am 37 weeks, she is anticipating my call that I am in labor. She is ready to witness Baby Martin’s entrance to the world via FaceTime. I told her I’ll have a nurse holding the phone right in front of my vagina [laughs]!\n\nDr. Damon [Kimes] gave Martin tips on how to be supportive during labor and shared some beautiful labor stories witnessing the birth of his three children.\n\nThe Daily Dish: What are you most excited about as you kick off this next chapter and expand your family?\n\nAudra: I am so excited to see what God has in store for our growing family. We are just getting started! More beautiful babies to come!"
