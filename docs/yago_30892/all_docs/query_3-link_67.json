        "text": "LIVING in Emmerdale means drama is never far away.\n\nOver the past year, the Dales has seen new people arriving, some returning and some saying goodbye with the latest being Jurell Carter.\n\nWhich characters have joined Emmerdale?\n\nRose Jackson played by Christine Tremarco\n\nFormer Waterloo Road and Casualty star Christine Tremarco made her debut as Rose Jackson, who is described as \"boisterous and bolshy\".\n\nThe Emmerdale newcomer shares a past with Will Taylor, and threatens to cause problems for his marriage to Kim Tate.\n\nAnnouncing the news that she had joined Emmerdale, actress Christine said: I am thrilled to be joining Emmerdale!\n\n\"To be working with such a wonderful cast and crew along with the brilliant writing and production team is an absolute joy!\n\n\"Rose is so much fun to play. She is free-spirited, boisterous and totally mischievous with a steely edge and a big heart.\"\n\nElla Forster played by Paula Lane\n\nActress Paula Lane joined the cast of Emmerdale in 2024, playing vet receptionist Ella Forster.\n\nSoap fans will recognise her for portraying the late Kylie Platt in rival soap Coronation Street.\n\nTalking about joining Emmerdale, actress Paula said: \"Everyone has been so welcoming and I can't wait to start a new chapter playing the role of Ella\".\n\n\"I've already heard there are big plans for her and I can't wait to see her navigate a new life in the village and hopefully make some friends!\"\n\nRuby Fox-Milligan played by Beth Cordingly\n\nSince Caleb Milligan rocked up Emmerdale with his past shrouded in mystery.\n\nHowever, he did mention a \"wife\", which turned out to be Ruby Fox-Milligan. Playing her is former The Bill star Beth Cordingly.\n\nSpeaking about joining the famous soap, the actress said at the time: \"I’m delighted to be joining the cast of Emmerdale, it's an enormous privilege and Ruby is a dream role.\"\n\n\"She's a firecracker and a troublemaker and I think people will love her or hate her, and I can't wait to get stuck in with this fabulous cast.\"\n\nWho has left Emmerdale?\n\nNate Robinson played by Jurell Carter\n\nOn June 25, 2024, The Sun reported that Jurell Carte who plays Nate, has quit the soap.\n\nNate arrived in the Dales in 2019 and immediately caused chaos when he had an affair with Moira Dingle.\n\nIt then turned out that he was the estranged son of Moira’s husband Cain Dingle, and it was all just a plan of revenge.\n\nNata and his dad finally managed to make up and he went on to marry Tacey.\n\nHowever, that relationship quickly came crashing down following her affair with Caleb.\n\nAnd now it looks like there is no chance of reconciliation on the cards as it has been confirmed Nate will have a dramatic exit next year.\n\nA source told us: “Nate has been at the centre of some huge storylines and his exit will be no different.\n\n“It will be dramatic and explosive and will go down in Emmerdale history. It won’t be one to miss.\n\n“Jurell has loved being on the soap but he’s a young actor and it’s understandable he wants to spread his wings.\n\n“Five years is a good run but he feels it’s time.”\n\nEthan Anderson played by Emile John\n\nIn May 2024, viewers watched as Ethan collapsed and suddenly died.\n\nHe had been the victim of a hit and run weeks before, which had caused internal injuries which went undetected.\n\nAfter his final scenes aired, actor Emile John took to Instagram and said: “After three years, Ethan’s journey on Emmerdale has come to an end,” he wrote in an emotional Instagram post.\n\nHuge thank you to those of you who have been invested in any of my storylines throughout my time on the show, seeing your reactions and opening important conversations have made it all the more worth it. With Love, Ethan Out.\n\nEmile John\n\n“I feel extremely privileged to have entered this industry working on such an Iconic show. I honestly had the time of my life! Sharing the space with such talented folk on and off screen for the last few years has been a huge honour and an experience that’ll stay with me always.\n\n“Huge thank you to those of you who have been invested in any of my storylines throughout my time on the show, seeing your reactions and opening important conversations have made it all the more worth it. With Love, Ethan Out.\"\n\nHeath Hope played by Sebastian Dowling\n\nCathy Hope was hoping to celebrate the New Year with an act of rebellion as she dragged her pal Angelica King and her twin brother Heath into one of her schemes.\n\nThe trio of teens managed to steal Wendy Posner's car before driving around the Yorkshire village, with Cathy behind the wheel as she was took driving lessons from her half-brother Scott - but their New Year's Eve celebrations took a turn.\n\nAfter being unable to find his children, Bob Hope ventured into the night alongside Wendy and the pair found Angelica and Cathy on the side of the road, with the nurse's car flipped over.\n\nBut while Cathy and Angelica made it out alive, Heath wasn't as lucky and it was revealed later on that he had suffered fatal injuries during the crash.\n\nActor Sebastian Dowling's last scenes were aired on New Year's Day 2024.\n\nThe young star played Heath since he was an infant in 2007.\n\nZak Dingle played by Steve Halliwell\n\nEmmerdale legend Steve Halliwell made his debut on the soap in 1994.\n\nSoon enough, he became a household name as the head of the iconic Dingle family, becoming one of the show's most beloved characters.\n\nThroughout his stint, Zak had been involved in a plethora of storylines, butting heads with some members of his own family and sharing a heart-warming love story with his wife Lisa Dingle who passed away herself in 2019.\n\nSteve went to sleep, peacefully with his loved ones around him.
