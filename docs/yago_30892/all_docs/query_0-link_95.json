        "text": "My mother, Mary Caroe, who has died aged 81, was often found “head down and bottom up” in a flowerbed at her home, Vann, near Godalming, Surrey. She and her husband, Martin, from a family of ecclesiastical architects and Nobel prizewinning physicists, were gifted Vann in 1969.\n\nIt was a huge challenge. The house, partly Arts and Crafts, needed repairs; the skylights leaked and Mary would line up an assortment of chamber pots on the main staircase to catch the rain. While “the bones” remained from the original garden design, including a Gertrude Jekyll water garden, ground elder and bindweed were rampant.\n\nWith minimal paid help, they cleared and replanted, quickly acquiring considerable knowledge, though Mary used to quip: “My husband married me because I am a good weeder.” Jekyll became an abiding interest and Mary recently raised funds for the digital reproduction of her 140 Surrey garden designs. The National Garden Scheme records 50 years of Vann opening to the public.\n\nOne of seven children of Elizabeth (nee Van den Bergh) and Stephen Roskill, a naval officer and historian, Mary was born in London and brought up in South Warnborough, Hampshire. On leaving St Mary’s school, Wantage, she was sent to a domestic science college in Dorset, which she hated. Instead, she told her father, she wanted to train as a doctor.\n\nAfter further studies at a crammer, and a year at her local Eggars grammar school in Alton, Hampshire to pass her remaining A-levels (returning to school uniform when she was already 20), she qualified at Westminster hospital medical school, then worked in London in general practice and family planning.\n\nAfter her marriage in 1962 and the move to Surrey, she continued working part-time, including with military families, and eventually taking a post for 15 years as a forensic medical examiner for the county’s constabulary. Years later she still could still recall many dramatic cases not least her first – an 80-year-old clergyman accused of murdering his wife. She could be on night duty at the Guildford police cells assessing those suffering from an excess of drink or drugs, yet be home in time to get her children ready for school. Spotting a need, she created a rape suite at the police station to reduce victims’ trauma and was the first doctor honoured with the Chief Constable’s medal.\n\nVann framed much of Mary’s life. She welcomed a huge circle of friends and relatives. There were concerts, Turkish carpet fairs, garden parties, family celebrations, and film stars from the BBC’s Howards End and Disney’s Christopher Robin, which were both shot at the house. Throughout her life, Mary’s energy was formidable, her interest in others deep, and she loved it all. Succumbing to Covid-19 was definitely not part of Mary’s plan: she had a full year of travel ahead with her regular companions; volunteering commitments at her community shop; and a host of social events lined up in her illegible diary.\n\nMartin died in 1999. Mary is survived by of her children, Oliver, Ruth, Emily and me, and eight grandchildren. Another son, William, died in 1974."
