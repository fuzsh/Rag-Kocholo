        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nHealth care is in the midst of major change, stimulated by the current economic challenges facing the world, the shifting demographics of most developed countries’ populations and the growing number of people living with long‐term illness. This unpredictable and dynamic environment requires healthcare professionals to demonstrate effective leadership.\n\nRegistered nurses working in advanced practice nursing (APN) roles have completed graduate education, have an expert level of knowledge and complex decision‐making skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice specific to the context in which they are credentialed to work (International Council of Nurses, 2009, p.1; National Council of State Boards of Nursing, 2008). Advanced practice nursing roles vary by title and description between countries. The two types of APN roles formally recognized in Canada are the clinical nurse specialist and nurse practitioner. Both are clinical roles that require master's level education and expected to embody the following five competencies; clinical care, leadership, research, consultation and collaboration (Canadian Nurses Association, 2008, 2010, 2014). In Canada, clinical nurse specialists provide expert specialized clinical guidance and leadership to assist nursing staff in managing complex patients and function within the same legislative and regulatory framework as registered nurses (CNA, 2008; Donald et al., 2010). Nurse practitioners have an autonomous expanded clinical practice that includes making a medical diagnosis, ordering diagnostic tests and prescribing medications and other treatments and function within a separate nurse practitioner‐specific legislative and regulatory framework (CNA, 2008; Donald et al., 2010). Leadership is an internationally accepted generic feature of APN (Mantzoukas & Watkinson, 2007). Advanced practice nurses are expected to demonstrate leadership competencies at an advanced level in their roles (Elliot et al., 2012; Nieminen, Mannevaara, & Fagerstrom, 2011; Schober & Affara, 2006), yet there are few comprehensive explanations about what an advanced level of leadership means or how to operationalize it in healthcare environments.\n\nAlthough APN roles have been in place for several decades, healthcare organization decision‐makers (managers, senior administrators and physicians) identify they have limited knowledge about the value‐added elements of these roles (Carter et al., 2013). Leadership, for example, is a capability that is often embedded in a series of complex actions in care delivery and therefore may not be apparent to decision‐makers (Calkin, 1984; Whitehead, Welch Dittman, & McNulty, 2017). This is problematic because to fully optimize the use of APN roles, clear expectations for intended outcomes must be established (Bryant‐Lukosius et al., 2007; Carter et al., 2010; Kilpatrick et al.,2014). The lack of knowledge about APN leadership constrains use of the full scope of these practice roles, thus limiting their potential impact on patient care and health system innovations. This article begins to address this knowledge gap by providing a clear description of APN leadership from the perspective of advanced practice nurses working in acute care settings.\n\n1.1. Background\n\nLeadership is a set of skills and abilities that a person embodies (Kouzes & Posner, 2007). A leader is the person who embodies and uses these abilities and skills to create a vision and engage others to share that vision. Although leadership is an expected attribute of all registered nurses, leadership in the profession is often considered to be role‐dependent (Scott & Miles, 2013). Those in administrative and management roles are considered formal leaders, while nurses in clinical roles, such as advanced practice nurses, are defined as informal or clinical leaders. The evidence supporting the relationship between formal nursing leadership and positive outcomes for patients and nursing staff is growing (Wong & Cummings, 2007). However, research examining the impacts of leadership demonstrated by informal nurse leaders on patients, fellow nurses and the broader system is scarce (Cummings, 2011). Advanced practice nurses are frontline healthcare providers and as such are often not recognized as formal leaders because the majority of their time is spent providing direct patient care. Although the demands of clinical practice often limit the time advanced practice nurses have for other advanced nursing practice activities, it creates opportunities to provide leadership at the frontline (Kilpatrick, DiCenso, et al., 2014; Mayo et al., 2010).\n\nThere is a substantive and growing body of synthesized research evidence demonstrating that advanced practice nurses provide safe and effective clinical care to patients (Kilpatrick et al., 2015; Martin‐Misener et al., 2015; Newhouse et al., 2011). Clinical care is the central core of APN roles, but it is only one of several dimensions that make these roles advanced. Research describing dimensions other than clinical practice such as leadership is needed if those aspects of APN roles are to be integrated and supported in practice (Bryant‐Lukosius, DiCenso, Browne, & Pinelli, 2004; Pauly et al., 2004). When advanced practice nurses are unable to fulfil all dimensions of their role, they are less satisfied and more likely to leave the role (Bryant‐Lukosius et al., 2007; Kilpatrick, DiCenso, et al., 2014).\n\nResearch about APN leadership is limited and mostly focused on elements related to team effectiveness and evidence‐based practice (Campbell & Profetto‐McGrath, 2013; Kilpatrick et al., 2013; van Soeren, Hurlock‐Chorrstecki, & Reevesm, 2011). An exception is a large case study, conducted in 13 sites across Ireland and involving 23 Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Practitioners (Clinical Midwife Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners). An important finding of this study was the identification of multiple activities that focused on two areas of leadership; clinical and professional (Begley et al., 2013; Elliot, Begley, Kleinpell, & Higgins, 2013; Elliot et al., 2012). Clinical leadership activities supported the development of nursing practice in clinical settings or services. Professional leadership activities supported the development of nursing practice outside the service at the national or international level (Elliot et al., 2013, p. 1039).\n\nThere are not any similar comprehensive studies of APN leadership in Canada. Differences in APN leadership may occur across countries due to the variation in role development, education, health policies and deployment. The ability to clearly identify and articulate APN leadership capabilities and their impact is needed, so that advanced practice nurses can be optimally educated and deployed to close the current leadership gap in healthcare organizations (Cummings & Estabrooks, 2003; Dickson, Briscoe, Fenwick, MacLeod, & Romilly, 2007; McCutcheon, Doran, Evans, McGillis Hall, & Pringle, 2009). The primary research question of this study was: How do advanced practice nurses working in an acute care setting describe their leadership and its impact on patient, healthcare providers and healthcare system outcomes?\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe APN Leadership Capabilities Model (Figure ) and associated domains (Tables & ) illustrate the nature of APN leadership and the complexity of APN roles. Each domain includes one or more capabilities. The model creates a language and a road map from which advanced practice nurses and others can begin to articulate their leadership roles. Nurses in advanced practice roles must be able to clearly articulate their roles to operationalize the full range of their capabilities (Calkin, 1984; Jones Charbachi, Williams, & McCormack, 2012).\n\nLeadership is often referred to as a competency in APN literature (CNA, 2010, 2014; Elliot et al., 2012; Hanson & Spross, 2005). The accepted definition of competency is practicing to a minimum safe standard in a predictable environment (CNA, 2005; Dickson et al., 2007). The advanced practice nurses in this study described being leaders in dynamic, unpredictable settings that required their sophisticated nursing knowledge and expertise. The LEADS Framework is founded on the concept of leadership as a set of capabilities that enable leaders to have the necessary skills to thrive in complex environments such as those described by the advanced practice nurses in this study (Dickson, 2010). Using the LEADS Framework to inform this study enabled the findings to be more representative of the reality of APN leadership as described by the participating advanced practice nurses.\n\nThe capabilities described in the APN Leadership Capabilities Model (Figure ; Tables & ) are comparable to many of the capabilities found in the LEADS Framework, for example, both include the capability of communicating effectively. Similarly, advanced practice nurses in this study described “enhancing professional nursing practice—bringing a high level of professionalism to their nursing practice” through modelling professionalism and having a vision for nursing practice (Table ), which is relevant to the LEADS capability of orient themselves strategically to the future (Dickson, 2010). One main difference between the LEADS framework and leadership described by advanced practice nurses in this study, is the focus of activities. When the advanced practice nurses described their leadership, it was in the context of making change at the level of the patient, nurse, healthcare provider or program and less frequently at the level of the entire healthcare system. The language used to describe the leadership capabilities in LEADS often refers to system level change and does not fully capture APN leadership.\n\nAdvanced practices nurses described their leadership as patient‐focused and organization and system‐focused. Leadership as described by Kouzes and Posner (2007) is a relationship between people. When the relationship is built on mutual trust, respect and confidence exemplary outcomes can be achieved. To build the relationship described above, Kouzes and Posner (2007) described five practices and ten commitments a leader can develop and practice to be exemplary. There are some common themes found between the practices and commitments of Exemplary Leadership (Kouzes & Posner, 2007) and the APN Leadership Capabilities Model (Figure ). For example, advanced practice nurses described modelling professionalism comparable to model the way a practice of Exemplary Leadership. Kouzes and Posner (2007) Exemplary Leadership includes the practice of encourage the heart, which is described as positive reinforcement of achievements and excellence. Advanced practice nurses in this study did not describe celebrating their successes as part of their leadership; therefore, a similar capability to the practice of encourage the heart, is not found the APN Leadership Capabilities Model.\n\nThe leadership capabilities outlined in the APN Leadership Capabilities Model (Figure ) are comparable to several competencies found in other APN frameworks. System leadership is one of the core competencies found in the Pan‐Canadian Core Competencies for the Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNA, 2014). It includes competencies such as facilitating interprofessional collaboration and integrating knowledge to make change and many others. Leadership is also a core competency in the Canadian Nurse Practitioner Core Competency Framework, which includes competencies such as managing clinical teams and acting as a mentor and preceptor (CNA, 2010).\n\nSimilarities can also be seen between the APN Leadership Capabilities Model and the Core Competencies of Advanced Practice Nursing model (Hamric, Spross & Hanson, 2009). Both models have layers of competencies or capabilities arranged in a circular manner, emphasizing patient care as the central feature of APN. Hamric, et al. (2009) denotes clinical and professional leadership as a core competency of APN practice. The clinical and professional leadership skills they describe are similar to some of the capabilities described in patient‐focused (Table ) and organization and system‐focused leadership (Table ).\n\nClinical and professional leadership activities were also identified by Elliot et al. (2012) in a large Irish study that was the first to examine APN leadership. For example, Elliot et al. (2012 pg. 1040–1046) described the following clinical leadership activities: initiates and changes patient/client care through practice development; changes clinical practice through formal education; guides and co‐ordinates the activities of the multidisciplinary team; and mentors and coaching the multidisciplinary team in clinical practice. These activities are comparable to the following capability domains in our study: improving the quality of care provided; managing patient‐centred care; and mentoring and coaching. Elliot et al. (2012) also described professional leadership activities that are similar to the leadership capabilities domains described by participants in our study such as: engages in professional organizations at a national or international level. These activities are relevant to the “organization and system‐focused leadership” capability domain of providing leadership on external committees and bringing the knowledge back to their practice environments. There were also some differences in the results between the two studies including the organizing themes as well as some specific leadership activities/capabilities identified in one but not the other study. Whereas Elliot et al. (2012) identified APN leadership as clinical or professional leadership activities, in the APN Leadership Capabilities Model leadership is defined through a set of capabilities that have an impact on the patient and the system or organization. Capabilities as defined by Dickson (2010) in LEADS are actions enacted in a complex, ever changing environment for which the person has more than the minimum knowledge and skill to act safely. An advantage of examining leadership in the context of patient, organization and system factors is that it provides a framework through which to begin to articulate the outcomes of APN leadership and understand the complexity of advanced practice nurses actions as leaders. Some of the differences in findings may be related to methodology. Elliot et al. (2012) national study used a case study method that included non‐participant observation of Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Practitioners (Clinical Midwife Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners), interviews with administrators and clinician team members and document analysis. Our study was much smaller in scope, involving only acute care advanced practice nurses in one Canadian city. Differences may also potentially be related to contextual differences in the study settings (country), healthcare systems, education of practitioners and or APN role expectations.\n\nLeadership is a shared responsibility of all nursing roles (CNA, 2009). For graduate prepared nurses working in APN roles, leadership is a core competency not simply a shared responsibility (CNA, 2008, 2010, 2014; ICN, 2009). The leadership skills of Registered Nurses working in non‐advanced practice roles (such as staff nurses) are often defined as the “staff nurse behaviours that provide direction and support to clients and the healthcare team in the delivery of patient care” (Patrick, Spence Lanchinger, Wong, & Finegan, 2011; pg 450). This definition has similarities to how advanced practice nurses in this study described their patient‐focused leadership capabilities in that both are focused on the best outcomes for the patient and family. The difference, noted by Patrick et al., (2011) and described by the advanced practices nurses in this study, is that advanced practice nurses demonstrate their leadership through integration of these capabilities in complex and unpredictable care environments.\n\nLeadership in the context of APN has varying definitions; often these definitions differentiate APN leadership as either clinical leadership, which influences patient care at the local level, or professional leadership, which involves a broader context of national and international organizations (Carryer, Gardner, Dunn, & Gardner, 2007; Elliot et al., 2012; Fealy et al., 2011; Gardner, Chang, & Duffield, 2007; Hamric et al., 2009; Hanson & Spross, 2005; Mantzoukas & Watkinson, 2007). Categorizing APN leadership as, clinical and professional leadership, did not resonate with participants of this study, they preferred “patient‐focused and organization and system‐focused leadership”. The themes and leadership capabilities in the APN Leadership Capabilities Model captured and provided descriptive language to articulate the breadth of leadership provided by advanced practice nurses.\n\nLeadership is a skill that must be developed, practiced and coached (Dickson, 2010; Kouzes & Posner, 2007). LEADS is a leadership framework intended to be a guide for developing leadership capabilities to be an effective leader, regardless of position or title in health care (Dickson, 2010). The LEADS Framework has informed this study and its findings. Educators could adopt the APN Leadership Capabilities Model as a guide to developing leadership capabilities in advanced practice nurses.\n\nLeadership is embedded in a series of complex actions in care delivery and may not be apparent or tangible (Calkin, 1984; Whitehead et al., 2017). As a result, the contribution that advanced practice nurses make to the healthcare system is often lost because what they do is considered clinical practice and not leadership. Beginning to use the language provided in “patient‐focused leadership and organization and system‐focused leadership” can assist advanced practice nurses in articulating what they do. This will allow those in decision‐making roles to better understand and capitalize on the valuable resource of APN leadership and what it contributes to patient, organizational and system outcomes.\n\nOther studies have shown that for many hospital decision‐makers, the most common avenue for them to receive information about APN roles is through advanced practice nurses in their organization (Carter et al., 2013). Therefore, it is incumbent on advanced practice nurses to be able to describe their roles and educate key stakeholders. Having a collaborative, evidence‐based APN vision and framework specific to the organization could facilitate consistency in communication of APN roles and could assist physicians and administrators to better appreciate the complexity and value added of APN roles. It is equally important for administrators and other stakeholders to educate themselves about APN roles.\n\nThe findings of this study advance understanding and provide a descriptive APN leadership model that could contribute to an overall vision and framework for APN practice in an organization. Supportive administrators (nursing and medical) are integral to implementing and sustaining APN roles. Therefore, the more consistent and evidence‐based the information that decision‐makers receive about APN roles, the more likely they are to understand and support these roles (Carter et al., 2010, 2013; DiCenso et al., 2010).\n\nAPN leadership needs to be articulated clearly, so that the impact of this leadership can be understood and measured (Kilpatrick, Kaasalainen, et al., 2014; Kleinpell, 2013). Unfortunately, when the abilities of professionals are not understood, they are often underused and talent can be wasted and the potential benefits to patients, nurses, healthcare providers and the larger health system can be lost.\n\n4.1. Study limitations\n\nThe study focused on describing leadership from the perspective of a sample of advanced practice nurses in two hospitals in one Canadian province, which may minimize the transferability of these results, given the variation in advance practice nurse roles across the globe. Although the study was open to both female and male advanced practice nurses in the two study sites, only females chose to participate. There may be gender differences in how leadership capabilities are defined and enacted that were not captured in this study. Future studies are required to expand on these findings with a larger sample spanning other practice settings, for example, primary health care."
