        "text": "I first saw The Lion King when I was younger than 5, and I don’t remember a time pre-Lion King. I have seen the Broadway play (yes, I cried) and have watched both sequels (Lion King 1.5 and Simba’s Pride). On Thanksgiving night, my brother and his wife, my sister and I all watched and rewatched the upcoming CGI Lion King. I hope I have conveyed how The Lion King is a much-loved movie in my family. But I hadn’t seen the movie in a few years and I was unsure how it would hold up. I watched the DVD release, and, confession, I skipped the added “Morning Report” musical number (dumb!!!).\n\nWhile there are many themes in the movie, there is one element I want to focus on. The theme about beliefs/perceptions of the past is mentioned throughout the film, notably in the song Hakuna Matata and in Simba’s conversation with Rafiki. Hakuna Matata — “No worries” — is a mindset that shrugs at the past and lives in the present. I remarked to my sister while watching the movie, that during Simba’s “problem-free philosophy” phase, he’s basically a hippie, living for fun and eating bugs instead of meat. If he were a human character, he’d probably be smoking weed at this point. This contrasts with Rafiki’s mentality. Everything that happens is connected to everything else. Mufasa communicates this in his monologue to young Simba about the Circle of Life — death is natural and provides life for other creatures. Later, Rafiki confronts Simba about his new Hakuna Matata life. Past pains should not be ignored — we must learn from the lessons pains provide, not discard them. This mindset is communicated visually throughout the film. For the first 2/3rds, the primary direction of the action on screen is from left to right. But when Simba finally decides to return to Pride Rock, he runs from right to left. His character is coming full-circle (literally, when considering the opening and closing song). Though the movie portrays the Hakuna Matata phase as a beautiful and appealing time in Simba’s life, The Lion King ultimately embraces the theme of facing your pain and trauma even when it is difficult. Within this theme, there are many other more subtle themes, such as gaining the truth about the past only when choosing to deal with those previous pains.\n\nThis message is related to what Simba believes. As a cub, he knows that he is destined to be king, and he wants to be king right away! The future kinghood is his identity and reality. But after he meets Timon and Pumba, he moves on from that belief. He does not view himself as the rightful king, despite a lingering longing to believe in the messages Mufasa conveyed to him when he was young. He believes that he cannot return to Pride Rock because his mother and the other lionesses will reject him. It is only after through remembering his identity as Mufasa’s son that he has a shift in his belief. To repeat what I said above, Simba comes full-circle, returning not just to Pride Rock but also to his belief that he is the rightful king.\n\nI loved watching The Lion King again for the umpteenth time! The colors in the film are so well used, and the songs are timeless. The voicework is good in all the characters, but Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones are the standout voice actors. It was fascinating to notice (for the first time) the sense of direction and movement in this animated movie. There were so many instances when I could not believe that humans created this movie with their hands on physical paper. Amazing. Many, if not all, of the establishing shots are simply breathtaking and wonderful to look at. The only part that felt dated to me is the slow-mo shots of Simba and Scar swiping at each other. I know there are some spiritual elements that do not align perfectly with Christianity, but I can appreciate the image of a Father telling his children who they are. My identity as God’s daughter is something I need reminded of, and this story has touched on that nerve in me. I give The Lion King 5 out of 5 stars."
