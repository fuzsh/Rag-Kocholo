        "text": "It is with broken hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved “Becky” Kellerstein just short of her 51st birthday. Becky fought long & hard to be with us here as long as she could.\n\nBecky was born on Sept. 29, 1973. Among the many family members who loved her dearly are: her husband, Daniel Kadoch, who was by her side until the end, children, Evan and Dalia Kadoch, parents, Faye and Martin Kellerstein, Lily Kadoch and the late Solomon Kadoch; brothers, Jeremy and David Kellerstein, brother-in-law, Arieh Kadoch, sisters-in-law, Jennie and Tali Kellerstein and Sandy Kadoch, and her many adoring aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews.\n\nAs the first grand daughter of Holocaust survivors, the late Helen and Philip Zucker, Ides and Isaac Kellerstein, Becky’s birth was very special and she was adored.\n\nDonations may be made to the charity that helped her so much over the years: Chai Lifeline Canada (https://chailifelinecanada.org/).\n\nThe abhorrent acts committed by the globally recognized terrorist organization Hamas on the citizens of Israel are reprehensible. The blatant disregard for humanity and the destruction they have inflicted on our homeland and its people is heartbreaking. These atrocities have absolutely devastated our communities and many others around the world.\n\nWhile Hamas may be working to create division amongst inhabitants of our homeland and throughout the globe, it is now more important than ever to stay unified as one. We would like to offer a place on our webpage for individuals in our community to share their messages of condolence to those who have been lost, their thoughts and prayers to all those who have been impacted, and their prayers of safety to those who are fighting for the security of Israel and its children\n\nPlease consider performing a Mitzvah in memory of those who have fallen."
