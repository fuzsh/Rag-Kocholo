        "text": "General Hospital sure loves its crossovers, and so do we. As All My Children vet Walt Willey begins his return engagement as Jackson Montgomery, our sister site TVLine reports exclusively that One Life to Live MVP Kassie DePaiva is about to bring Blair Cramer to Port Charles for a brief stint.\n\nHmm. Considering that DePaiva’s episodes will start airing in September, and we’re thisclose to learning the identity of Martin’s infamous third ex-wife… Is anybody else thinking what we’re thinking — that Blair is Martin’s ex?!? (Review other possible candidates here.)\n\nDePaiva first visited General Hospital in 2012, shortly after One Life to Live aired for the last time on ABC. Back then, she was involved on screen with longtime leading man Roger Howarth, aka Todd to her Blair. He’s since gone on to replace James Franco as Franco (RIP) and tackle the new role of surprise Quartermaine Austin.\n\nSo if the former castmates were to cross paths in Port Charles, it wouldn’t be like a reunion. Blair wouldn’t know Austin… or would she? “I could go, ‘You’re hot,'” she recently suggested to Soap Opera Digest. “‘You look like somebody I used to know.’”\n\nDePaiva got her soap start back in 1986 as Chelsea Reardon on Guiding Light. Seven years later, she replaced Mia Korf as Blair — in one of the more memorable recasts ever — and remained in Llanview as One Life to Live moved to The Online Network. She’s been married since 1996 to former One Life to Live co-star James DePaiva (Max), who also played Dr. Bensch on General Hospital.\n\nIn addition to All My Children’s Jackson and One Life to Live’s Todd, Blair, Starr, McBain and Nora, General Hospital has also crossed over Ryan’s Hope’s legendary Delia Ryan and hinted at a tie between mobster Joey Novak and that much-missed soap’s Joe Novak.\n\nPer DePaiva, her air dates are Friday, Sept. 15, and Monday, Sept. 18."
