        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nStephen Grover Cleveland was born in Caldwell, NJ on 18 March 1837, the fifth child of Presbyterian minister Richard Falley Cleveland and Ann Neal Cleveland. When Grover was four, the Clevelands moved their family to Fayetteville, New York. In addition to Grover, the Clevelands had eight other children: Ann Neal, William Neal, Mary Allen, Richard Cecil, Margaret Louise Falley, Lewis Frederick, Susan Sophia and Rose Elizabeth.\n\nIn 1855, Grover Cleveland settled in Buffalo. With the help of his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, Cleveland found a position in a law firm and began to study the law. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1860. It was in Buffalo that Grover Cleveland began his political career with the Democratic Party. He served in various positions including ward supervisor, sheriff, assistant district attorney and, in 1882, mayor of Buffalo. That same year Cleveland was elected Governor of New York. From Albany, Cleveland went to Washington, DC, serving as the 22nd President of the United States (1885-1889) and then again as the 24th President (1893-1897).\n\nGrover Cleveland married Frances Folsom (1864-1947) in June 1886. The couple had five children: Ruth (1891-1904), Esther (1893-1980), Marion (1895-1977), Richard Folsom (1897-1974) and Francis Grover (1903-1995). After leaving the presidency in 1897, Grover Cleveland moved his family to a home he had built in Princeton, NJ. Here he worked on his book, Presidential Problems, gave public lectures and served as a trustee of Princeton University. After a brief illness, Grover Cleveland died at his home in Princeton on 24 June 1908."
