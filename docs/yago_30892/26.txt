ABC released this statement today: “We at ABC were very saddened to learn about the passing of one of All My Children’s original cast members, Mary Fickett, who portrayed beloved nurse Ruth Brent Martin from 1970-1995 and again from 1998-2000. As we honor All My Children’s 41 years on ABC, we cannot help but recognize and remember Mary’s wonderful depiction of Pine Valley’s revered Ruth. Ruth’s marriage to chief of staff Dr. Joe Martin provided the bedrock upon which the town of Pine Valley was built. Their marriage was always a stabilizing force that represented ‘home’ for many.

“In memoriam, the network will dedicate the September 21 episode to Mary, which specifically focuses on the Martins. We extend our deepest sympathy and thoughts to Mary’s family and longtime fans.” Fickett also appeared on The Edge of Night. All My Children ends it run on ABC Sept. 23.
