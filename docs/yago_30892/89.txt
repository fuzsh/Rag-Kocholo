Actress Mary Fickett has passed away at the age of 83 at her home in Virginia.

Receiving her acting debut with Bing Crosby in 1957’s “Man on Fire”, she would become best known as Ruth Martin on “All My Children”. Thanks to the show she would go on to become the first performer to ever win an Emmy from a daytime soap opera.

ABC released this statement with plans of dedicating the September 21st episode of “All My Children” in Fickett’s memory:

We at ABC were very saddened to learn about the passing of one of All My Children’s original cast members, Mary Fickett, who portrayed beloved nurse Ruth Brent Martin from 1970-1995 and again from 1998-2000. As we honor All My Children’s 41 years on ABC, we cannot help but recognize and remember Mary’s wonderful depiction of Pine Valley’s revered Ruth. Ruth’s marriage to chief of staff Dr. Joe Martin provided the bedrock upon which the town of Pine Valley was built. Their marriage was always a stabilizing force that represented ‘home’ for many.
