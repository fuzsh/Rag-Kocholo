"We at ABC were very saddened to learn about the passing of one of All My Children's original cast members," the network said in a statement. "As we honor All My Children's 41 years on ABC, we cannot help but recognize and remember Mary's wonderful depiction of Pine Valley's revered Ruth. Ruth's marriage to chief of staff Dr. Joe Martin provided the bedrock upon which the town of Pine Valley was built. Their marriage was always a stabilizing force that represented 'home' for many."

Before All My Children, Fickett starred alongside Bing Crosby in Man on Fire. She was also nominated for a Tony for her turn as Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello.
