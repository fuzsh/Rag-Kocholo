        "text": "Raising a teenager is already challenging, and even more so with a low-paying job and an absence of stable housing. That was the reality Tammy faced before she found herself at LifeMoves Villa, which serves families, single women, and veterans. Determined to turn things around, Tammy and her son were able to access the help they each wanted or needed.\n\nTammy wasted no time in her pursuit of improved circumstances. With determination and the assistance provided by LifeMoves, she greatly improved her credit score, and secured a higher-paying job with more favorable hours, giving her a solid foundation to rebuild their lives.\n\nHer son’s journey was more intricate. With an IEP (Individual Education Plan) in hand, his educational and social needs require careful attention. Through the TAP-In Tutoring program, his academic abilities soared, earning him over $100 in incentives. Transportation hurdles were overcome, ensuring his regular attendance, and provisions were made for independent study when transportation faltered. Additionally, he received invaluable one-on-one teen therapy services through LifeMoves.\n\nAs they navigated their challenges, Tammy and her son found a sense of belonging within the Villa community. With the support of fellow residents, they tackled obstacles head-on. Within a mere three months, they had not only regained their confidence but also accumulated savings substantial enough to secure their own home.\n\nNearly two years after their departure from LifeMoves, Tammy and her son continue to thrive in the same apartment. Tammy now serves as a property manager for the company that owns her unit, and she personally oversees five properties.\n\n“LifeMoves fueled my determination because going back is not an option,” Tammy affirmed. “Taking a leap of faith is what LifeMoves taught me,” she added, reflecting on the organization that extended a helping hand when she needed it most.\n\nMeanwhile, her son faced his own struggles, grappling with depression following the anniversary of his father’s passing. However, with resilience and support, he’s excelling academically, earning A’s and B’s, forming friendships, and enjoying school.\n\nThrough it all, his IEP remains a valuable tool, continuing to guide and support his educational journey.\n\nTammy proudly holds up a set of keys, as shown in the picture, and reflects on how far they’ve come. These keys, which are the same set that she currently has today, represent her resilience, determination, and the unwavering belief that a brighter future is always within reach.\n\nCarlos was a battle-hardened Marine and his son had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. But their journey is one of resilience and hope.\n\nCarlos served two tours in Iraq, risking his life to serve his country. When he returned home, he found himself struggling with mental health issues. With nowhere to turn, Carlos and his son became unhoused. When the VA referred him to LifeMoves The Villa, Carlos and his son received interim housing and wrap-around services that gave them much-needed stability and support as they navigated their way back to a life of self-sufficiency.\n\nWith this support, Carlos secured two jobs — working for the railroad and as a security guard. With his case manager’s help, Carlos secured a VA Supportive Housing voucher and moved into a two-bedroom home. But more challenges lay ahead. Carlos wanted to open a bank account and improve his credit score of 560. Carlos raised his credit score to 640 in just three months – a testament to his desire to rebuild his and his son’s lives.\n\nCarlos also worked closely with LifeMoves to ensure his son’s special needs were met. From enrolling him in Head Start to accessing additional academic assistance, Carlos was tenacious in securing the best opportunities for his child. Carlos and his son graduated from The Villa program. Their story is a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming challenges, help, hope, and hard work can light the path to a better future.\n\nMy husband died after 35 years of marriage and I was left to raise our 4 children. We were ready to start our next chapter when my husband was killed by a drunk driver. I ended up living in my car. Then the LifeMoves Outreach Team found me.\n\nDeborah, my case manager at LifeMoves Mountain View, helped me find grief counseling and support finding a job and housing. I didn’t tell my family while I was here because they all wanted to take me in. And if I did let them help me out, I knew I would still be dependent on another individual for the rest of my life.\n\nI needed to discover who I was without my husband. I had never worked outside my home before. LifeMoves helped me build the confidence and skills to do it. I got my first job. And then another, and then another. At one point, I was working three jobs.\n\nStaying here allowed me to save more money than I’ve ever saved in my whole life. And then I found a place to live — and it’s awesome. I love my new neighborhood and my independence. I don’t know if I’d be where I am right now without LifeMoves."
