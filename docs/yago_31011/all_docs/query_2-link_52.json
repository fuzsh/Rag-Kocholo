        "text": "All of a sudden, things started happening on the stuff I’m\n\ndoing on the sides. My work at “So You Think You Can Dance”\n\nis going on well (although intense at times) and before you\n\nknow it, we’re just left with another month to go. My first\n\nproper musical work will (hopefully – at this time of writing)\n\nbe featured in the next “Malaysiana” episode (Top 12) of\n\nthe show and Pat Ibrahim himself will be choreographing the\n\ndance to the song. Elation! Then, a couple of weekends ago I\n\ngot a call from Pacai\n\nsaying he might want to feature one of the remixes I did for\n\nhis song Tanya (sung by\n\nAfdlin Shauki)\n\non Sumo-lah‘s\n\nsoundtrack. Ecstasy! In between it all, I also finally get to\n\nmeet up with Audi Mok\n\nwho graciously let me in on some of his unreleased tracks and\n\nhis music production techniques. In the excitement though, I\n\nforgot to hand him those cans of lychee I owe him.\n\nSo it’s been weird driving around town with those cans rolling\n\nabout in my car since.\n\nI’m not sure how the stuff I mentioned above will help me\n\nget laid anytime soon. That’s why I’m keeping my day job for\n\nnow. Not that the latter will get me laid either.\n\nI really need to get out more often.\n\nWhen I asked God for Strength, He gave me difficult situations to face;\n\nWhen I asked God for Brain & Brawn, He gave me puzzles in life to solve;\n\nWhen I asked God for Happiness, He showed me some unhappy people;\n\nWhen I asked God for Wealth, He showed me how to work hard;\n\nWhen I asked God for Favors, He showed me opportunities to work hard;\n\nWhen I asked God for Peace, He showed me how to help others;\n\nGod gave me nothing I wanted, He gave me everything I needed.\n\n– Swami Vivekananda\n\nI feel compelled to write again after having let a good amount of\n\nwater run under the bridge already. But with the Raja Muda of\n\nPerak Raja Dr. Nazrin Shah getting married to Zara Salim Davidson\n\ntoday, it’s certainly an occasion worthy to take note of. I feel\n\nlike a lot of pressure has been lifted off my shoulders already\n\nwith their tying the knot. See, if His Highness can wait till he’s\n\n50 to get married to someone as brainy and hot as Zara, I think\n\nthere’s still plenty of hope for me yet.\n\n60 is the new 40 indeed."
