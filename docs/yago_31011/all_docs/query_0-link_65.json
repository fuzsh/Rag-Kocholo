We'll see who's coming tomorrow.\n\nWell you're right about the Crown Prince of Brunei attending. I was hoping some of the senior Brunei royals would attend so we'd get to see some great pictures from Infofoto and I got my wish (although I was hoping for more pictures of all the tiaras and jewels).

During the arrival procession of the Royal Couple to the Throne Hall we could clearly see that she murmured some prayers unheard to make herself calm down since she looks so nervous as they walk towards the Throne Dais. However as the Royal Couple sat on the throne both regain their control and relax.\n\nThe King raised the Sword of the Kingdom as an affirmation that he is installed as the Head of State instead of kissing the sword.\n\nThe Grand Chamberlain who led the ceremony was handpicked by Sultan Mizan himself.\n\nRoyal Banquet - Photos\n\nArrivals:\n\nThe new King greets the Sultan of Brunei\n\nNur Zariah greets Queen Saleha of Brunei\n\nNur Zariah greets Princess Azrinaz of Brunei – Azrinaz is the second wife of Sultan Bolkiah.\n\nSultan Bolkiah greeting guests\n\nQueen Saleha and Princess Azrinaz greeting guests\n\nThe monarchs of Brunei and Malaysia\n\nBefore the banquet:\n\nThe royals – (Image gallery)\n\nOn their way to the banquet:\n\nThe two monarchs\n\nQueens Saleha and Nur Zariah\n\nL-R: Sultanah Najihah of Negeri Sembilan (in pink), Sultana Bainon of Perak (in Red) & Princess Azrinaz; behind them, in turqoise, is Sultanah Haminah of Kedah\n\nPrince Abdul Malik and Princess Masna – son and sister of the Sultan of Brunei\n\nThe banquet:\n\nImage Gallery 1 - Click Here\n\nImage Gallery 2 - Click Here\n\nGroup Photos:\n\nThe Ladies - From the right: Sultanah Kalsoom of Pehang (in turqoise), Princess Azrinaz of Brunei, Sultanah Najihah of Negeri Sembilan, Queen Saleha, Queen Nur Zariah, Sultanah Bainon of Perak, Sultanah Haminah of Kedah.
