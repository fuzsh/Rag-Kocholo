        "text": "Ipoh, the capital of Perak state in Malaysia. Located within the Kinta Valley – the most productive tin mining district in the world and surrounded all around by limestone hills and mountain ranges, Ipoh is a picturesque city locked in time. It is an important midway point between Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\n\nUnlike Penang and Singapore, Ipoh only emerged as a city in the early 20th century. While people moved into the town in the 1820s, it was only in the 1870s when the British were invited in to protect Ipoh that modern facilities such as railways stations and neat pavements were introduced. Yes, the British were invited in. The sultan wanted protection and invited the British in. This is itself is deserving of a whole separate post.\n\nWhile not the royal capital (Kuala Kangsar), Ipoh is an important city within the sultanate of Perak. The state of Perak, a hereditary sultanate, recently installed a new sultan – Nazrin Shah.\n\n(I guess most people reading this blog dont know malay, cuba lah!)\n\nThis explains the Daulat Tuanku signs (love live the king) throughout the main thoroughfares of Ipoh.\n\nIpoh’s boom era arrived in the 1920s and 1930s when tin mining became extremely important and miners were brought in to the mining town.\n\nMany of these miners were Chinese labourers, which explains why Ipoh is a city with a Chinese majority population (around 44 % of the population). This is not unlike Penang, although whereas Penangnite Chinese are mostly of Hokkien heritage, Ipoh Chinese are mostly Cantonese. Other areas with significant Chinese populations in Malaysia include the cities of Malacca and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe tin mining industry continued to be a vital cog in the Ipoh economy until its global collapse in the 1980s. Since then, Ipoh-natives have had to leave their hometown in search of better futures. After almost 3 decades of remaining an economic backwater, the winds of change seem to be turning in Ipoh’s favour once again. People are moving to Ipoh, with the city’s current 750,000 population expected to increase by a third in 5 years to 1 million, ironically because of the very local Ipohlites who had to leave in the decades prior. Their arrival has raised property prices in the tin state and led to a greater interest in investment within Ipoh. More property buyers in Ipoh have also begun to opt for high-rise apartments meaning, the city as you see it now (without skyscrappers), will probably change in a few years.\n\nIronically the cost of living in Ipoh is rising faster than in larger cities. It is considered to be as expensive as (if not more expensive than) Penang and KL. A rental apartment in Ipoh costs between RM1200-RM1500 a month while the average salary is between RM27000-RM40000 a year.\n\nWith Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and Penang having already established themselves as tourist sights, Ipoh is revitalizing its tourism sector to draw in the crowds hungry for a new must go location.\n\nTo that end, developments like The Haven Ipoh have risen up.\n\nSource\n\nBeyong tourism, plans were also announced earlier in the year by a private developer, for an educational and medical hub to be located within Ipoh.\n\nIpoh is famous within the region for its culinary scene and the Cantonese influence on its food. Although weak on marketing (unlike Singapore and Penang), Ipoh can proudly consider itself a haven of local cuisine. The quality of the ingredients (mostly locally sourced and grown using water near the limestone caves) is considered one of the many reasons for its amazing food.\n\nIpoh is also a newcomer to the cafe culture, sweeping across the Malayan Peninsula (Singapore, KL, Penang, Malacca and now Ipoh).\n\nAmong locals (Malaysians) and Singaporeans, Ipoh is known for another reason – it’s beautiful women. The urban myth has been in existence for as long as anyone can remember is that Ipoh women are the most beautiful throughout the Peninsula. Some put it down to the beauty of Cantonese women, others claim that its the water and food that they consume, others say its the Michelle Yeow effect (Michelle Yeow is from Ipoh and is therefore the face of Ipoh women to the world). Attractive women are everywhere, though I’m inclined to say that having celebrities like Carmen Soo, Shila Amzah and the Queen Zara Salim as ambassadors does help a city’s reputation.\n\nMichelle Yeow (Source)\n\nCarmen Soo (Source)\n\nShila Amzah (Source)\n\nTuanku Zara Salim Davidson (Source)\n\nSure it’s shallow, but that’s not stopping articles from being written of the attractive girls in and around Ipoh (here and here) – its only based on looks, but it gets eyeballs and thats how much of journalism works.\n\nIpohlites include not just the above but also many prominent others such as Singapore’s first president Yusof Ishak, former Singapore Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, former Speaker of Parliament (Singapore) Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng, medical luminary Dr Wu Lien-teh, businessman Eu Tong Sen (of Eu Yan Sang fame) and Sri Lankan Tamil political leader SJV Chelvanayakam.\n\nWhat makes this city so charming? Join me on an adventure around Ipoh over the next few days!"
