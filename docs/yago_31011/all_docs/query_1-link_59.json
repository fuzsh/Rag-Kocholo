        "text": "KUALA KANGSAR, May 17 (Bernama). While Raja Muda Perak Raja Dr Nazrin Shah was pronouncing his marriage vow at the Istana Iskandriah here today, the royal bride, Zara Salim Davidson, sat serenely on a specially constructed dais that captured the rich heritage of the Malays. It was specially made by Datin Seri Zubidahtul Radthuan Muhammad Ali Piah, the wife of Datuk Seri Mansur Raja Razman, who is the Comptroller of the Perak royal household.\n\nZubidahtul, who is also a member of the Perak nobility, said the triangle top of the dais was a gold-plated carving from Terengganu while the gold embroidered cloth background was from Kelantan. The square gold embroidered cushions with orchid motifs and yellow round pillow used to decorate the dais were made by craftsmen in Perak, she said. “I have had the idea for a long time, but it took me a week to complete it,” she told Bernama here today. Placed on the left and right of the dais were gold-plated vases specially brought in from Kelantan to further add to the glitter of the wedding ceremony.\n\nZubidahtul said the design was unique and showcased the rich Malay heritage. She was also responsible for making the special cushion on which the Raja Muda sat when pronouncing his marriage vow. Zubidahtul, who also loves cooking, had also been part of the Malaysian delegation that was led by celebrity chef Redzuawan Ismail, better known as Chef Wan, to the “Gourmand World” in France in 2004 and was given the responsibility to introduce Perak royal dishes there. At today’s ceremony, she also designed a special display showcasing Perak royal dishes.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nDatin Seri Zabidahtul Radthuan, or fondly known as Datin Moi or Auntie Moi among relatives, is also a keen antique collector. On 1 June 1992, she was appointed as Orang Besar Tiga Puluh Dua with title of Y.D.H. Toh Perkema Wati. She is married to Raja Datuk Seri Mansur Razman.\n\nMohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi, was the last Shah (Emperor) of Iran (16 September 1941 to 11 February 1979). He made an official visit to Malaysia which included Perak in 1968, accompanied by his wife, Her Imperial Majesty Empress (Shahbanu) Farah Diba. The Shah was bestowed the Darjah Utama Seri Mahkota Negara (DMN) by the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong during this visit to Malaysia.\n\nThe Shah was overthrown during the Iranian revolution in 1979, following which the Iranian monarchy was dissolved. The Shah died of lymphoma in exile in Egypt a year later."
