She arrived in the church escorted by her eldest brother, the present Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg.\n\nWhat a beautiful tiara. Can anyone tell me more about it?\n\nThe Dukes of Bedford\n\nCan anyone please provide photos of the weddings of the 13th, 14th , 15th Dukes of Bedford and also of the Bedford sons Lordy Robin Russell and his younger brother James. The 14th Earl is Robin who married Henrietta Tiarks, and the 15th is Andrew who married Louise Crammer(?)\n\nI do hope that someone can help.\n\njahagz said:\n\nIs there any news on when the Duke of Huescar will be marrying? She's quite wealthy, no?​\n\nThere is no official news, the wedding at the moment is a rumor. The marriage of the Duke of Huescar with his first wife, Matil Solis, already has been annulled by the Church, so it will be necessary to wait. Probably if there is wedding, this one will be discreet.\n\nHis current couple is Alicia Koplowitz, Marquise of Bellavista, one of the richest women of Spain together with her sister Esther. She also is divorced of her first husband.\n\nAlicia Koplowitz\n\nhttp://estaticos02.cache.el-mundo.net/elmundo/fotos_gente/2006/11/24/1164391764_extras_fotos_gente_1.jpg\n\nHannelore said:\n\nThe couple had 5 children:\n\n- Princess Cristina (married to Pedro Lopez-Quesada): photo can be found here http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/411463-post16.html\n\n- Princess Maria (married to archduke Simeon of Austria): wedding thread can be found here (+ a photo of princess Cristina's wedding) http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f31/archduke-simeon-von-habsburg-princess-maria-de-borbon-dos-sicilias-1996-a-6802.html?highlight=simeon ... same veil as her mother.\n\n- Prince Pedro (married to Sofía Landaluce)\n\n- Princess Inès (married to Michele Carelli Palombi): wedding thread can be found here: http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f31/princess-ines-de-borbon-dos-sicilias-michele-carrelli-2001-a-7660.html\n\n- Princess Victoria (married to Markos Nomikos) : wedding thread can be found here: http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f31/princess-victoria-de-borbon-dos-sicilias-markos-nomikos-2003-a-4571.html?highlight=nomikos ...
