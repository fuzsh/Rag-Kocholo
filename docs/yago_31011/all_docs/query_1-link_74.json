        "text": "MAHIRA Khan is a Pakistani actress who tied the knot with Ali Askari back in 2007.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the reputed producer, actor, and director.\n\nWho is Mahira Khan?\n\nMahira Khan is a well-known Pakistani actress who started her career as a video jockey in 2006.\n\nKhan is best known for playing the role of Khirad Hussain in the romantic drama Humsafar for which she received several accolades, including Lux Style Award for Satellite Best TV Actress and Hum Award for Best On-Screen Couple with Fawad Khan.\n\nThe 38-year-old made her big screen debut alongside Atif Aslam in Bol, 2011, which earned her a Lux Style Award for Best Film Actress nomination.\n\nShe then went on to make her Bollywood debut in 2017 with action-romance Raees with Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nThe award-winning actress has also played roles in the films Bin Roye (2015), Ho Mann Jahaan (2015), and Superstar (2019), and made her debut as a producer with the sports web series Baarwan Khiladi (2022).\n\nKhan is considered one of Pakistan's most popular and highest-paid actresses.\n\nIn 2012, she was named the Most Beautiful Woman in Pakistan.\n\nIn the Sexiest Asian Women poll by Eastern Eye, she was listed tenth in 2015, ninth in 2016, fifth in 2017, and ninth again in 2019.\n\nShe was also called Pakistan's sexiest woman.\n\nThe actress also serves as an ambassador for several brands such as Lux, QMobile, Gai Power Wash, Huawei, Sunsilk, Veet, and L'Oreal.\n\nIn 2020, Khan was on the list of the BBC's 100 women, announced on November 23.\n\nKhan recently tied the knot with businessman Salim Karim in a private ceremony, on Sunday, October 1.\n\nThe wedding took place at the Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nKarim is the CEO of a startup that simplifies financial transactions through SIM cards, as well as a DJ.\n\nWho is Mahira Khan's ex-husband?\n\nMahira Khan's ex-husband is Ali Askari, 36.\n\nBorn in New York on August 8, 1987, Ali comes from a very well-reputed family in Pakistan.\n\nHe grew up in Florida and is known as one of the best producers, actors, and directors of Pakistan.\n\nKhan met Askari in 2006 in Los Angeles, before marrying him in 2007 in a traditional Islamic wedding ceremony - despite Khan's father being reportedly against the marriage.\n\nThe couple share a son, Azlan, who was born in 2009.\n\nThey parted ways in 2014 and got officially divorced in 2015 before Askari went on to marry Zara Dadabhoy in 2017.\n\nThe writer and director studied film at the New York Academy and the Los Angeles Film School and his works include the short film Dark All Around, which premiered at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in the short film corner.\n\nHe has also worked alongside well-known actors such as Michael Kenneth Williams, Paul Sorvino, Josh Helman, and Yael Stone, amongst others.\n\nAskari currently works at MTV Pakistan.\n\nWhy did Mahira Khan get divorced?\n\nIn August, the Humsafar actress opened up about her \"painful\" divorce from Askari.\n\nSpeaking on the FWhy Podcast hosted by Pakistani actress and former model Frieha Altaf, Mahira stated that she and Askari were \"childhood sweethearts\" and were always meant to be together.\n\nKhan added: \"Post Azu, I knew my marriage was...even prior I think....But I think you let it go on and you love the person, who is your childhood sweetheart.\n\n\"But I think that was a very painful and difficult time. I was so young at the time. I had a baby, I was scared.\n\n\"Professionally, I was very successful. I never knew I would become successful overnight with Humsafar. But personally, it was a tough time.\n\n\"When you are going through it, it is very painful. You are sitting in a room, and you feel the walls are closing in on you. You feel anxious and you don't know what it is. I think that is more painful than when you make a decision.\n\n“The first few years were very painful because it was about two good people, it was not an abusive relationship. But it was like two kids had gotten married and sometimes two people evolve differently. There was a little bit of pressure to go back as well,” Mahira shared.\n\n\"I knew that I would take my child but I knew that I didn't want to be dependent on anyone, not even my parents. When there was nobody with me, I had my work. It was a huge support\", she said.\n\nKhan and Askari now co-parent their son Azlan as the two had decided that whatever happens between them, their son would be their priority."
