        "text": "Arabs are NOT Orientals.\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan\n\nLalla Salma of Morocco\n\nLalla Meryem of Morocco\n\nLalla Hasna of Morocco\n\nPrincess Haya of Jordan\n\nPrincess Rym of Jordan\n\nPrincess Noor of Jordan\n\nLalla Soukeina of Morocco\n\nPrincess Imane of Jordan\n\nNONE of these are orientals! These are middle-easterners and Arabs.\n\nOriental also does not means Asian.\n\nOrientals are those from China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Of these only Japan has reigning royal house so only Masako in the running and she is not a royal but I guess it still counts since she married the Crown Prince of Japan.\n\nAsians are those from South East Asia ie Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia. Of these, only Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand and Cambodia have reigning royal houses. Again Asians are also not Orientals.\n\nFrom the MENA region - Sheikha Mozah of Qatar (used to be Queen Rania but all that plastic surgery has her looking )\n\nFrom the Far East - in her youth, Queen Sirikit would be ahead of the entire field...by miles. She was stunning and IMO outshined Queen Paola during that time. Now I would say Zara Salim Davidson, the wife of the Crown Prince of Perak in Malaysia. Beautiful, elegant, and at least in pictures has a very sweet quality."
