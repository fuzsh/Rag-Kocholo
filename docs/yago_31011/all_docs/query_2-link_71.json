He was born in the town of Ghayl Bawazir in Hadhramaut province. He finished his formal schooling at the age of 16 and, due to his family's poverty, went off to Aden in search of work. He worked there for several years in various commercial stores before returning to Hadhramaut in 1962. However his stay in Mukalla, the capital of Hadhramaut, proved short-lived and he went back to Aden in 1963, working as manager of a well-known commercial store for the next 33 years. In 1997, he tried one more time to settle down in Mukalla but this attempt too proved unsuccessful. He went back to Aden for the last time to live out the final years of his life.\n\nYemeni novelists · 14T\n\n20th-century novelists · 2,733T\n\nYemeni writers · 42T\n\nAli Salim al-Beidh Vice President of Yemen\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nAli Salem al Beidh (‘Alī Sālim al-Bīḍ, Arabic: علي سالم البيض‎) (born 10 February 1939) is a Yemeni politician who served as the General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) in South Yemen and as Vice President of Yemen following the unification in 1990.
