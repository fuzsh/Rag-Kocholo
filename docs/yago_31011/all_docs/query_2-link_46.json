        "text": "Jewels in Motion: Jubilee Tiaras in Brunei\n\nROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast weekend, a glittering Golden Jubilee celebration took place in Brunei, honoring the fifty-year reign of Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th Sultan of Brunei. The festivities included a banquet with lots of tiaras, and I’ve got a whole post’s worth of them glittering — in motion! — for you today.\n\nThree notes! First: many of these GIFs contain flash photography. Second: don’t take this post as an endorsement of the politics of some of the rulers and regions shown. (That should really go for many posts on the blog, really.) And finally, because I know I’ll get asked — I don’t have any more information, provenance or otherwise, on the individual tiaras than I’m sharing in the post.\n\nQueen Saleha, the senior wife, queen consort, and first cousin of the sultan, wore a grand tiara set with white and yellow diamonds.\n\nAnother view of the tiara; note the largest yellow diamond in the middle of the top cluster element.\n\nThe only major European country to send representatives for the jubilee was Britain. The Earl and Countess of Wessex represented the Queen at the celebrations.\n\nSophie wore her convertible diamond and aquamarine tiara for the banquet, pairing it with a multigem suite that she’s had in her jewelry box for several years.\n\nBecause I know so many are interested, here’s a glimpse of Sophie’s tiara hair for the occasion.\n\nThe woman in the all-diamond suite here is the Raja Puan Besar of Perak, wife of the Sultan of Perak. Perak is a Malaysian state.\n\nHere’s one more view of her jewels. Born Zara Salim Davidson, she runs an oil and gas consulting firm in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHere’s the Sultan of Terengganu, who served as King of Malaysia from 2006 until 2011, with his wife, Sultanah Nur Zahirah. She’s wearing a full suite of diamond jewels.\n\nSharafuddin Idris Shah, the Sultan of Selangor (another Malaysian state), attended with his wife, Norashikin Abdul Rahman. She wore an intriguing fringe tiara for the banquet.\n\nThe Selangors are newlyweds; they married in August 2016. She was a television personality before her wedding. Here she’s standing beside the bejeweled Permaisuri of Johor, wife of the Sultan of Johor (another Malaysian state).\n\nAnd last, but not least, we’ve got the Raja Muda and Raja Puan Muda (Crown Prince and Crown Princess) of Perlis, who hail from the smallest state in Malaysia. He’s the son of Sirajuddin of Perlis, the state’s current raja. She’s wearing a diamond tiara and a necklace that appears to have a substantial diamond and pearl pendant.\n\nThis Week in Royal Jewels: October 6-12\n\nOctober 6-12, 2017\n\nGet ready for an extra sparkly week of royal jewels! Don’t forget to vote for your favorites in the poll below! (Also: please note that this post features some GIFs that include flash photography.)\n\nANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images\n\n10. For her wedding to Philip of Serbia, son of Crown Prince Alexander, Danica Marinkovic wore a demi-parure of diamond and emerald jewels, plus scattered pearls in her hair. (Much more over here!)\n\nANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images\n\n9. Pearls and her mother’s diamond and ruby pendant were Queen Sofia of Spain’s choice for the royal wedding in Serbia this weekend. (More over here!)\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\n8. The Duchess of Segorbe, mother of Philip of Serbia, wore a diamond and emerald pendant that belonged to her late mother-in-law for her son’s wedding in Belgrade. (Much more over here!)\n\n7. On the second night of the Dutch state visit to Portugal, Queen Maxima wore pieces from the family’s Mellerio Ruby Parure for a gala at the national theater.\n\nJAVIER SORIANO/AFP/Getty Images\n\n6. Queen Letizia surprised jewel lovers by debuting the Countess of Barcelona’s Pearl Drop Brooch on National Day on Thursday. (Much more over here!)\n\nANDRE KOSTERS/AFP/Getty Images\n\n5. For her official welcome in Lisbon on Tuesday, Maxima glittered in diamonds, including a large diamond brooch. (More views over here!)\n\n4. The family emeralds were Maxima’s choice for the state banquet in Lisbon on Tuesday evening. (See more of the jewels over here!)\n\n3. The Earl and Countess of Wessex attended this weekend’s Golden Jubilee festivities in Brunei, and for a celebratory banquet, Sophie paired her convertible aquamarine tiara with a multigem suite that she’s had for several years. (More about the tiara over here!)\n\n2. Queen Saleha, wife of the Sultan of Brunei, wore an astonishing suite of yellow and white diamonds for the jubilee banquet.\n\n1. My top vote of the week goes to a surprise appearance from a set of royal heirloom diamonds: the Duchess of Braganza wore the King Luis Diamond Tiara with Queen Amelie’s Diamond Choker for the Dutch state banquet.
