        "text": "The massive crowd of well-wishers that visit the open house of Perak Menteri Besar seems to grow larger and larger with every festivity.\n\nFor this year’s Hari Raya Aidilfitri, as usual, the Perak Menteri Besar Open House was held just before the Perak state-level open house, at his official residence. Parking was horrendous, and the process was made more difficult with the unrelenting afternoon heat.\n\nYet, the public continued to stream in, to be entertained and feted to local delicacies like redang, satay, lemang, mee goreng, kuey teow and cendol. I take my hat off to those who have the patience to queue up, and again at the different stalls serving food and drinks.\n\nAs usual, there was a generous line up of entertainment from local artistes, including the aboriginal Sewang dance. The function was emceed by Perak-born Shamsul Ghau Ghau.\n\nPopular children’s animation, Upin and Ipin, made a surprise visit to the open house, much to the delight of young children, who took the opportunity to say hello and grab a photo with their favourite cartoon characters.\n\nBut the best thing about open houses like these is that children received “duit raya” from Perak Menteri Besar Dato’ Seri Dr. Zambry and his wife. Earlier, HRH Raja Nazrin and HRH Tuanku Zara distributed yellow packets of “duit raya” to orphans too.\n\nEvent: Perak Hari Raya Open House 2013\n\nVenue: Perak Menteri Besar official residence, Ipoh\n\nDate: 8th Aug, 2013\n\nTime: 2.30pm – 6pm"
