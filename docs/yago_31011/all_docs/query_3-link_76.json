        "text": "Early life and education\n\nHe was born on 19 April 1928 at Kampung Manggis, Batu Gajah, Perak. A child of Sultan Yussuf Izzuddin Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Abdul Jalil Karamatullah Nasiruddin Mukhtaram Shah Radziallah (reigned 1948–d. 1963) by his second wife, Toh Puan Besar Khadija binti Toh Indera Wangsa Ahmad (1906–1991), he was brought up by his mother outside royal circles.\n\nRaja Azlan Shah began his education at the Government English School, Batu Gajah Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan Yussuf. For his secondary education, he attended Malay College, Kuala Kangsar. Afterwards, he went to the University of Nottingham to study law, earning a Bachelor of Law degree in 1953. While in school, Azlan Shah began his lifelong love for field hockey, playing for his school teams. He subsequently played for the Perak team.\n\nLegal career\n\nRaja Azlan Shah was admitted to the English Bar on 23 November 1954. He returned to Malaysia, becoming the Assistant State Secretary of Perak. He joined the Judicial and Legal Service of the Federation of Malaya and soon became the President of the Sessions Court. He continued rise quickly through the legal ranks, serving as Federal Counsel and Deputy Public Prosecutor, Legal Adviser of the State of Pahang, Registrar of the High Court of Malaya, and Chief Registrar of the Federal Court of Malaysia.\n\nIn 1965, Raja Azlan Shah, aged 37, became the youngest judge ever appointed to the High Court of Malaya. He was appointed to the Federal Court in 1973. In 1979, he was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Malaya. Finally, on 12 November 1982 he became the youngest ever Lord President of the Federal Court, the highest judicial post in Malaysia.\n\nBecoming Sultan\n\nRaja Azlan Shah was installed Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Perak by his uncle, Sultan Idris Almutawakkil Alallahi Shah II on 1 July 1983. During, the long reign of Idris Shah most of Raja Azlan Shah's elder brothers had died. His only surviving elder brother, Raja Baharom Shah, refused the office of Crown Prince and Raja Azlan Shah was suddenly heir to the throne.\n\nWithin six months, Sultan Idris died and Azlan Shah succeeded to the throne of Perak on 3 February 1984. He was officially installed as the 34th Sultan of Perak on 9 December 1985. In April 1989, Sultan Azlan Shah became the ninth Yang di-Pertuan Agong (elected king) of Malaysia. After the five-year term, he returned to his post as Sultan of Perak in 1994.\n\nPerak constitutional crisis\n\nIn 2009, the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) political group held a narrow majority in the Perak state assembly with 32 of the 59 seats. Three members of the party decided to leave, and allied themselves with the rival BN coalition. PR leader Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin requested to dissolve the parliament. Sultan Azlan refused the request, citing royal discretion, and instead demanded Mohammad Nizar and the rest of the leadership resign their posts to make way for BN leaders.\n\nThe decision was challenged and the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that the Sultan was not constitutionally permitted to dismiss the menteri besar. However, upon appeal, the decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal which rules that the Perak State Constitution gives absolute discretionary power for the Sultan to dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. The Court also directed Nizar to resign. The decision was subsequently upheld unanimously by the five-man Bench of Federal Court in February 2010.\n\nEducation\n\nSultan Azlan was the Pro-Chancellor of the Universiti Sains Malaysia from October 1971 to February 1981 and the Chancellor of the University of Malaya from February 1983 until his death. He also served the Chairman of the Higher Education Advisory Council from 1974 to 1976. The University of Malaya awarded him an honorary doctorate in June 1979 and the University Science of Malaysia awarded him one the following June.\n\nSultan Azlan was recognised by several foreign universities, including:\n\nUniversity of Nottingham, Honorary Doctor of Law, July 1986\n\nHonourable Society of Lincoln's Inn, \"Honorary Bencher\", 1988\n\nUniversitas Gajah Mada, Jogjakarta, Indonesia, Honorary Doctor of Law, 28 September 1990\n\nUniversiti Brunei Darussalam, Honorary Doctor of Law, 30 October 1990\n\nChulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, Honorary Doctor of Law, 19 December 1990.\n\nRoyal College of Physicians of Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Honorary Fellow, 2 October 1991\n\nRoyal College of Surgeons of England, Honorary Fellow, 1999.\n\nSports\n\nSultan Azlan was an avid supporter of field hockey throughout his life.

He was an Executive Board member of FIH (International Hockey Federation), serving as vice-president for two terms starting in 1992. Under Azlan Shah's leadership, Malaysia twice hosted the World Cup, in 1975 and 2002.
