Saga 105.2 FM was an Independent Local Radio station in Glasgow, Scotland, part of the Saga Radio Group, which operated from 7 September 2004 to 23 March 2007. From December 2005 it was also broadcast in the East of Scotland on DAB, serving Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians. It was the last radio station to be licensed by the Radio Authority before it became part of Ofcom.

The Radio Authority had four criteria for awarding the licence: commercial viability; reflection of local taste; depth of local support; and whether it would extend consumer choice. On this last point, Saga's easy listening station, targeting the over-50s, was reckoned to score favourably. Asked to pick the front-runners, rival bidders reckoned Saga and the rock stations had the edge. Ron Coles, director of Saga Radio, claimed his Glasgow research showed that 91 per cent of people in the target age group would be likely to listen to his kind of station. He said the 50-64 age group had the most disposable income and was worst-served by the city's current radio offerings.[1]

A spokesman for the Radio Authority said:

When the authority comes to assess the applications it receives, it will be taking into consideration applicants' proposals to cater for the tastes and interests of listeners in this area, and to broaden the range of audience choice in relation to existing Independent Local Radio (ILR) services which are available.[2]

Development

The station was tailored for the over-50s and presenters included ex-Radio Clyde DJ Dave Marshall, as well as Bryce Curdy, Angus Simpson and Art Sutter.

At its peak it had a reach of 229,000 in September 2006 and a market share of 7.30% in September 2005. Its first year figures were ahead of the expectations of managing director Norman Quirk.

Following GMG Radio buying Saga Radio in December 2006 it was announced that Saga 105.2 FM was to be rebranded as Smooth Radio from March 2007. This was a brand name being used by GMG for its soul stations in London and the North-West of England and would also be adopted by Saga's sister stations in the Midlands.

On 23 March 2007 the last voice to be heard on the station was that of Angus Simpson who thanked the listeners and played the last record “Bringing on Back the Good Times” by Love Affair, the same song that launched the station two years previously. Immediately following at 6pm was the “Smooth Preview Weekend” giving listeners a taste of the music to come on the frequency. The official launch of Smooth Radio took place at 6 am on Monday 26 March 2007 with new breakfast presenter, ex-Radio Clyde DJ John McCauley.
