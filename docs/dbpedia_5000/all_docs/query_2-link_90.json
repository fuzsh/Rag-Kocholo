        "text": "Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a 28-year-old junior draughtsman at a Glasgow architecture firm when he drew up the designs for the building that many consider his masterpiece.\n\nThe first half of the Glasgow School of Art building was completed in 1899.\n\nBut the dramatic art nouveau design of the building in the Garnethill area of the city centre took another 12 years to be completed, finally opening in 1909.\n\nIt heralded the birth of a new style in 20th Century European architecture.\n\nIt is now considered one of Scotland's most admired and influential buildings and Mackintosh, under-appreciated in his own time, is lauded as one of the country's finest designers."
