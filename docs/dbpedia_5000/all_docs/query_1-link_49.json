        "text": "DAB+ is now widespread in the UK. Both of the commercial national ensembles have some DAB+ services on board. In addition, there are services broadcasting on most of the small-scale trial ensembles. DAB+ is gradually spreading to the established local ensembles. It is true to say that for most of the population, if you don't have a DAB+ receiver, you are missing out on services. A \"tick mark\" has been launched as a marketing tool to signify receivers that meet a certain minimum specification. DAB+ capability is expected to be one of the requirements for the tick mark. Wohnort recommends, now more than ever, that you should consider buying a receiver that is DAB+ capable.\n\nTuning to Block 11A\n\nThe frequency allocated to the second national commercial multiplex lies outside the range of the seven blocks used during the initial UK DAB roll-out. Some older radios may not include Block 11A in their automatic scans. In this case, select the option \"Full Scan\" in the receiver's menus. This may also be called a \"Rest of the World\" scan, as opposed to a \"UK\" scan."
