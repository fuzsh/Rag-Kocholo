        "text": "The Common Good is supported, recognised and embedded within all of our courses and the wider student experience. The learning experience at GCU will prepare our students to develop our four ‘Common Good Attributes’ and equip them to make a positive difference to the communities they will serve.\n\nThe Common Good Curriculum will support our students to achieve the GCU Common Good Attributes which are underpinned by GCU’s core values: Integrity, Creativity, Responsibility and Confidence. We place learner agency at the centre of all our Common Good Attributes as we believe our students have the capacity to set their own goals, reflect and effect positive change.\n\nOur students will develop the attributes needed to make a positive difference in addition to achieving the knowledge, skills and values of their professional and disciplinary area.\n\nWe want to enable our students to develop new ideas and engage in activities that address societal challenges on a local, national or global scale.\n\nWe will provide opportunities for all students to develop these attributes further by participating in co and extra-curricular activities aligned to our Common Good mission. Some opportunities are tailored to students on particular courses; others are open to all students across the University."
