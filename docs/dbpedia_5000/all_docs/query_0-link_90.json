        "text": "The nation has voted Careless Whisper as its favourite song for the fifth year in a row.\n\nThe George Michael hit, released in 1984, has been declared the number one pick for Smooth Radio’s All Time Top 500.\n\nThe annual list of the UK’s best-loved songs declared the winner on Tuesday and Michael has also been crowned the most popular artist in the poll with a total of 20 songs included.\n\nAlmost 32,000 votes were made to Smooth for its All Time Top 500 poll.\n\nMichael, who died on Christmas Day in 2016 aged 53, wrote Careless Whisper with and pop partner Andrew Ridgeley for their Wham! album Make It Big.\n\nIn a joint statement, George Michael Entertainment and his family said: “Five years in a row at number one! What can we say?\n\n“It means so much to us that you have shown how much Careless Whisper means to you by voting and getting it to the top once again this year.\n\n“We are truly grateful for your continued support and George would be so delighted”.\n\nNext month marks what would have been Michael’s 60th birthday.\n\nIn March Channel 4 released the documentary series George Michael: Outed, which sparked an increase in interest around the star.\n\nComing in at second on the Smooth Radio poll was Sir Elton John, with 14 songs in the top 500 including his collaboration with Michael, Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me.\n\nThe 76-year-old global superstar said in December “there is no more fitting way to say goodbye to my British fans” than playing his final UK show at Glastonbury following his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.\n\nWhitney Houston, who died in 2012 aged 48, was named the Global radio station’s most popular female artist with 12 songs including I Will Always Love You at number seven.\n\nA new biographical film Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody, starring Naomi Ackie, was released in December which explored the life of the American singer and actress.\n\nSecond place went to Madonna, who is about to embark on a new tour featuring four decades of her music.\n\nAbba was voted the most popular band of all time and comes following their Abba Voyage digital concert being launched in London last year.\n\nThe Swedish band have 14 entries in the countdown, led by Dancing Queen at number ten and The Winner Takes It All at number 40.\n\nSmooth presenter Angie Greaves said: “Smooth’s All Time Top 500, now in its 10th year, celebrates the best music and gives us a fantastic insight into the nation’s favourite songs and artists.\n\n“Next month would have been George Michael’s 60th birthday and it is wonderful that his incredible legacy lives on through his music, as Careless Whisper is voted the nation’s all-time number one song and George is voted the most popular artist.\n\n“Looking across the chart, from Sir Elton John and Whitney Houston to Abba and Madonna, it is wonderful to see the variety of music the public has chosen this year.”"
