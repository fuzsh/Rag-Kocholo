        "text": "Howard joins from UTV Radio, where he was a regional programme director.\n\nThe licence to launch the FM station was originally won by Saga Radio in April 2006 and was transferred to GMG when it bought Saga in December.\n\nThe station will be the sixth Smooth outpost after London, Glasgow, North West England, the East Midlands and the West Midlands.\n\nThe licence area covers a potential 2m adult listeners in and around Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Durham and Hartlepool.\n\nSmooth, which focuses on music from the last five decades and targets a 40-plus audience, will broadcast from a newly built studio complex that will also be home to GMG's other station in the region, 100-102 Century FM.\n\nJohn Myers, GMG Radio chief executive, said: \"Launching a second radio station in the north-east on the back of a very successful Century is something we are really looking forward to.\n\n\"Our new Smooth service is aimed at those who want a wider mix of music and a softer style which we are confident will bring new listeners to commercial radio and take audience away from the BBC.\""
