        "text": "The Glasgow Climate Change Conference convened after a year-long postponement due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Parties adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact: a series of three overarching cover decisions that provide an overall political narrative of the Conference of the Parties (COP). For the first time in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, there is a reference to phasing down unabated coal power and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Some of the substantive aspects of the decisions include calls for:\n\ndeveloped countries to double their adaptation finance from 2019 levels, by 2025; and\n\nparties that have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to do so before the next COP.\n\nThe Pact also establishes:\n\nan annual high-level ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition;\n\nthe Glasgow Dialogue between parties on loss and damage, to convene from 2022 to 2024; and\n\nan annual dialogue to strengthen ocean-based action.\n\nThere are sections on science, adaptation, adaptation finance, mitigation, finance, technology and capacity building, loss and damage, implementation, and collaboration in the cover decisions, except for the one related to the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nBefore COP 26 convened, 153 countries, accounting for 49% of global greenhouse gas emissions, had updated their NDCs to the Paris Agreement. As estimated by the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report, these updated NDCs would lead to 2.7°C of global warming by 2100. Developed countries had also published a road map that admitted that they would miss the promised USD 100 billion per year by 2020 climate finance goal, and would not likely achieve it before 2023.\n\nAgainst this modest beginning, the World Leaders’ Summit brought together over 120 Heads of State and Government. There were strong calls for greater ambition, and several developed countries made new financial pledges. The UK Presidency tallied that USD 800 million was pledged for adaptation over COP 26, including the first-ever US contribution to the Adaptation Fund. Additional financial pledges came from Japan, Germany, and Spain, among others. There were a few new NDC or net zero pledges. Most notable among these was India’s pledge for net zero by 2070. There are estimates that the new NDCs and net zero pledges, taken with NDCs and net zero pledges submitted before the COP, would lead to 1.8°C to 2.4°C of global warming by 2100, if these pledges are fully implemented.\n\nNew partnerships and declarations announced during the Leaders’ Summit included:\n\nthe Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use, signed by 120 countries, to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, backed by public funds for forest conservation and a global roadmap to make 75% of forest commodity supply chains sustainable; and\n\nthe Global Methane Pledge, signed by over 100 countries, to commit to collectively reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nThroughout COP 26, many other declarations and alliances were announced, in Presidency-led events or in press conferences.\n\nAfter the leaders left, despite divisive negotiations, parties managed to finalize the Paris Agreement Rulebook and adopt other substantive outcomes. During the closing plenaries, parties reflected that the overall package was not perfect, and many stressed that they were adopting the package “in the spirit of compromise.” Many developing countries lamented the outcome on loss and damage. They had called for a financial mechanism for loss and damage, but the outcomes on loss and damage only include a strengthened Santiago Network and its technical support functions, and a two-year dialogue.\n\nIn completing the Paris Agreement rulebook, the Agreement is now operational and implementable. Since 2018, when countries completed most of the elements of the rulebook, Article 6 (cooperative approaches) and common time frames remained missing elements. In Glasgow, decisions were adopted on both issues to operationalize carbon credit trading, a carbon market, and a framework for non-market-based approaches. On common time frames, countries agreed to submit new NDCs in 2025, that will have an end date of 2035, and, in 2030 to submit NDCs with an end date of 2040, and so on. It will provide regular five-year updates to NDCs, with each lasting for ten years.\n\nThe enhanced transparency framework was fully completed, with the tables, outlines and other formats for the reports agreed. This will enable parties to submit their first biennial transparency reports under the Paris Agreement in 2024. Support for developing countries to undertake their obligations under the enhanced transparency framework was included in the finance decisions.\n\nThe Glasgow Climate Change Conference convened from 31 October – 13 November 2021. This was the first in-person meeting for a multilateral environmental agreement to take place since the global COVID-19 pandemic began. In total, 39,509 people registered for the conference: 21,967 representatives from parties and observer states; 14,033 observers; and 3,781 media.\n\nThe Conference featured unique arrangements, including daily testing requirements and socially-distanced meeting rooms. There was a 10,000-person limit to the Blue Zone, where negotiations and side events took place, which was often reached by midday. For those unable to access the Blue Zone, an online platform facilitated access to negotiations and other events. Throughout the Conference, and particularly during the World Leaders’ Summit, observers drew attention to the lack of access for civil society to negotiation spaces. Some aspects of the meeting were more familiar, including last minute huddles in plenary to work through outstanding issues. Data related to COVID-19 infection rates were not published.\n\nA Brief History of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement\n\nThe international political response to climate change began with the 1992 adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which sets out the basic legal framework and principles for international climate change cooperation with the aim of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, has 197 parties.\n\nTo boost the effectiveness of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in December 1997. It commits industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets for a basket of six GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005 and has 192 parties. Its first commitment period took place from 2008 to 2012. The 2012 Doha Amendment established the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020. To date, 145 parties have ratified the Doha Amendment.\n\nIn December 2015, parties adopted the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, all countries will submit NDCs, and will review the aggregate progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation every five years through a Global Stocktake. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, and, to date, 193 parties have ratified the Agreement.\n\nRecent Key Turning Points\n\nParis: The 2015 UN Climate Change Conference convened in Paris, France, and culminated in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12 December. The Agreement includes the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. It also aims to increase parties’ ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. The Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, each party shall communicate, at five-year intervals, successively more ambitious NDCs. Under the common time frames decision adopted in 2021 in Glasgow, each NDC will last ten years, but will still be updated every five years. The Paris Agreement also includes a transparency framework, and a process known as the Global Stocktake. Beginning in 2023, parties will convene this process at five-year intervals to review collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation. The Agreement also includes provisions on adaptation, finance, technology, loss and damage, and compliance.\n\nWhen adopting the Paris Agreement, parties launched the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) to develop the Agreement’s operational details. Parties also agreed on the need to mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action by all parties and non-party stakeholders to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals. Several non-party stakeholders made unilateral mitigation pledges in Paris, with more than 10,000 registered actions.\n\nMarrakech: The UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech took place from 7-18 November 2016, and included the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). Parties adopted several decisions related to the PAWP, including: work should conclude by 2018; the terms of reference for the Paris Committee on Capacity-building; and initiating a process to identify the information to be provided in accordance with Paris Agreement Article 9.5 (ex ante biennial finance communications by developed countries). Other decisions adopted included approving the five-year workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM), enhancing the Technology Mechanism, and continuing and enhancing the Lima work programme on gender.\n\nFiji/Bonn: The Fiji/Bonn Climate Change Conference convened from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, under the COP Presidency of Fiji. The COP launched the Talanoa Dialogue, a facilitative dialogue to take stock of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals. The COP also established the “Fiji Momentum for Implementation,” a decision giving prominence to pre-2020 implementation and ambition. Parties also provided guidance on the completion of the PAWP and decided that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement, subject to decisions to be taken by CMA 1-3. Parties also further developed, or gave guidance to, the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, the Executive Committee of the WIM, the Standing Committee on Finance, and the Adaptation Fund.\n\nKatowice: The Katowice Climate Change Conference convened from 2-14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland, concluding a busy year that featured an additional negotiation session to advance work on the PAWP. Parties adopted the Katowice Climate Package, which finalized nearly all of the PAWP, including decisions to facilitate common interpretation and implementation of the Paris Agreement on the mitigation section of NDCs, adaptation communications, transparency framework, Global Stocktake, and financial transparency, among others. Work on cooperative approaches, under Article 6 of the Agreement, was not concluded, and parties agreed to conclude this work in 2019. The COP was unable to agree on whether to “welcome” or “note” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C of Global Warming.\n\nChile/Madrid: The Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference convened in Madrid, under the COP Presidency of Chile. Decisions were adopted on the review of the WIM and some finance-related issues, such as guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Green Climate Fund (GCF). Parties also adopted three decisions each named the Chile/Madrid Time for Action. On many other issues, notably Article 6 and long-term finance, countries could not reach agreement.\n\nIntersessional Meetings: The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the normal meeting cycle. Online sessions were held in June and November 2020 to hear updates from the constituted bodies and hold mandated events. The Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020 served as a platform for countries to put forward new NDCs and net zero pledges. A subsequent online summit was convened in April 2021 by US President Biden. In June 2021, the Subsidiary Bodies met online for informal consultations. No decisions were taken. The meeting was a chance to share views, which were captured in informal notes prepared by the Chairs.\n\nReport of the Meetings\n\nThis report summarizes the discussions by the five bodies based on their respective agendas. It begins with the governing bodies for the Convention, Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, and then turns to the subsidiary bodies. The Glasgow Climate Change Conference was comprised of the following:\n\n26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26)\n\n16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 16)\n\n3rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 3)\n\n52nd-55th meetings of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 52-55)\n\n52nd-55th meetings of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 52-55)\n\nOpening Ceremony\n\nCOP 25 President Carolina Schmidt (Chile) opened the meeting on Sunday, 31 October 2021, and reminded delegates that science is non-negotiable and climate change requires multi-sectoral, transformative change. She stressed the importance of non-party stakeholders in climate action.\n\nCOP 26 President Alok Sharma (UK) described the IPCC Working Group I (WG I) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report as a wake-up call, and said COP 26 “is our last best hope to keep 1.5°C in reach.”\n\nSusan Aitken, Leader of Glasgow City Council, expressed hope that Glasgow, as a post-industrial city with a 2030 carbon neutrality target, can inspire delegates.\n\nUNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa highlighted three priorities: increasing ambition, especially by members of the Group of 20 (G20); achieving finance targets and mobilizing trillions of dollars; and strengthening adaptation action. She urged inclusion of all stakeholders and observers.\n\nHoesung Lee, IPCC Chair, called the WG I report sobering and said the true measure of effectiveness of collective efforts is the state of the climate system, which science attests is deteriorating.\n\nAbdulla Shahid, President of the UN General Assembly, called for enhanced efforts to meet the USD 100 billion finance goal with equal shares for mitigation and adaptation, monitoring private sector net zero targets, and investing in green jobs.\n\nIndia Logan-Riley, Ngāti Kahungunu, Aotearoa New Zealand, pointed to Indigenous leadership and resistance to fossil fuel extraction, and emphasized the need for a decolonial response to climate change, with the Global North committing to halting emissions and redistributing finance.\n\nOpening Statements: Parties and observers provided opening statements that shared their expectations for work under all of the bodies.\n\nGuinea, for the GROUP OF 77 AND CHINA (G-77/CHINA), called on developed countries to enhance their absolute economy-wide emissions reduction targets and scale up provision of support, stressed climate finance as key to success at COP 26, and underscored the need to fulfill long-standing climate finance commitments, such as the USD 100 billion goal.\n\nThe EUROPEAN UNION (EU) stated the group would “fight” for an ambitious outcome that advances action well before 2030. She outlined elements of a successful outcome, including: robust rules for Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches); enhanced transparency framework arrangements; and a common time frame for all parties’ NDCs.\n\nSwitzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), emphasized three priorities: rules, finance, and ambition. He called for rules to be operationalized, not reopened, and for COP 26 to launch efforts to define the post-2025 finance target and ensure alignment of all financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAustralia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, highlighted as critical, inter alia: finalizing the Paris rulebook, including on common time frames and the enhanced transparency framework; advancing work on adaptation; and enhancing action for practical, locally-led adaptation and resilience efforts.\n\nGabon, for the AFRICAN GROUP, underscored its expectation that resolution on the consideration of Africa’s special needs and circumstances would be reached, noting scientific evidence of the continent’s vulnerability. He called for: reaching agreement on the operationalization of the global goal on adaptation (GGA) by COP 27, concluding work on the new finance goal at COP 27, and for the “transparency package” to ensure adequate support for developing country reporting.\n\nBolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), lamented developed countries’ “history of broken promises,” pointing to a lack of ambition in the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period and the failure to fulfill the USD 100 annual finance commitment. He underscored that calling on all countries to reach net zero by 2050 is “anti-equity” and said unilateral carbon border adjustments are discriminatory.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), called for: a formal platform to take stock of the gap to the 1.5°C goal, a COP 26 decision for major economies to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2023, and a concrete outcome at COP 26 on financial support for loss and damage, noting this should be additional to the USD 100 billion goal. She emphasized the need for grant-based finance to ensure vulnerable countries’ fiscal space.\n\nPeru, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), urged parties to address the climate crisis on the basis of science. She called for: the G20 to take action following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), a new collective finance goal, and operationalization of the Santiago Network on loss and damage.\n\nIndia, on behalf of BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, and CHINA (BASIC), underscored the principle of CBDR-RC and special circumstances of developing countries, especially in the context of COVID-19. He urged developed countries to dramatically reduce their emissions and increase support to developing countries on finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. He called for a new quantified finance goal and a clear roadmap to achieve it.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, urged preserving balance across agenda items, especially under Article 6, and called for extending the action plan of the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures (KCI) due to COVID-19-related delays.\n\nBhutan, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), highlighted finance, adaptation and support to address loss and damage as priority issues, stressing that “finance is now about rebuilding trust.” He called for operationalizing the Santiago Network on loss and damage, and stressed that both the COP and CMA continue to have authority to govern the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts (WIM).\n\nNoting it had recently ratified the Paris Agreement, TURKEY said its withdrawal of an agenda item proposal on an amendment to Annex I of the Convention was an indication of the country’s will to work constructively.\n\nArgentina, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), stressed climate finance as crucial for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement and for greater ambition and, cautioning against “new categories,” underscored that all developing countries need assistance for sustainable recoveries. He proposed a body focused on advancing the post-2025 climate finance target, with equal representation from developed and developing countries, and clear and specific activities.\n\nPapua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, highlighted the global importance of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and the need for constructive outcomes on transparency. On Article 6, she urged against “taxing mitigation to fund adaptation,” noting all future credits must be covered by NDCs.\n\nGuatemala, for the CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM, appealed for recognition as a region highly vulnerable to climate change, which should be given priority access to financing. He demanded urgent resource mobilization, increased official development assistance, and strengthened adaptation efforts.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES (LGMAs) underscored the need for multi-level climate action and called for channeling resources to the local level.\n\nRESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (RINGOs) called for reaching agreement on the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook to ensure full implementation of the Paris Agreement and noted science stands ready to support parties’ work.\n\nTRADE UNION NGOs (TUNGOs) emphasized every sector needs to decarbonize, but that this requires engaging workers in social dialogue, ensuring quality jobs and social protection, and delivering climate education.\n\nWOMEN AND GENDER lamented the murders of environmental defenders, calling for safeguarding human rights and investing in regenerative justice. The impacts of failing to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C will be devastating, she said, underscoring “there is no time for hollow speeches.”\n\nCLIMATE ACTION NETWORK regretted the significantly reduced participation of observers. She said the global health and climate crises have increased inequality, so civil society will do everything it can for this COP to deliver what is needed for vulnerable people around the world.\n\nGLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEMAND CLIMATE JUSTICE criticized the exclusion of observers and demanded an end to the fossil fuel era coupled with “real zero” targets in line with equity and fair shares.\n\nFARMERS stressed the potential of farmers and agriculture to contribute to climate action, noting that only 15% of climate finance has been allocated to agriculture and calling for this imbalance to be redressed.\n\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES expressed concern about nature-based solutions developed without Indigenous Peoples’ input and their free, prior, and informed consent. She called for the adoption and implementation of the draft second workplan of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP).\n\nYOUTH NGOs (YOUNGOs) called for “action today at COP 26,” urging parties to finalize the Paris rulebook. Citing the UN Secretary-General’s call to “give youth a seat at the decision-making table,” they asked for meaningful constituency engagement at the meeting.\n\nWorld Leaders’ Summit\n\nOn 1 and 2 November, over 120 world leaders gave statements. There were several new financial announcements and some countries, notably INDIA and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, announced new NDCs.\n\nOpening Ceremony: Earth to COP: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson drew attention to the seriousness of the climate crisis, warning against the “anger and impatience” of the world should COP 26 not deliver the scale of action needed. He stressed that solutions are attainable, and the developed world has the responsibility to fund climate action in developing countries.\n\nBrianna Fruean, an advocate from Samoa, stressed the power of words to “change worlds,” and called on leaders to “wield the right words” followed up by action. She highlighted the leadership of Pacific youth, rallied under the cry “we are not drowning, we are fighting.”\n\nTxai Suruí, Amazon youth, urged ending “the pollution of hollow words.” She said that, while people were closing their eyes to reality, one of her childhood friends was murdered for protecting forests. She called for placing Indigenous Peoples at the center of COP 26 decisions.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said that recent climate action announcements might give the impression the world is on track to fulfilling the Paris Agreement’s objectives. Calling this an illusion, he cautioned that if commitments fall short by the end of this COP, countries must revisit their plans, not every five years, but every year, until 1.5°C is assured, fossil fuel subsidies end, carbon has a price, and coal is phased out.\n\nHis Royal Highness Charles, Prince of Wales, underscored that trillions, not billions, of dollars are needed to create a sustainable future. He said world leaders understand that the cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of prevention and urged them to work together to save the future for young people.\n\nCOP 26 People’s Advocate Sir David Attenborough said the stability of the climate system that enabled the development of human civilization is breaking, urging world leaders to turn this tragedy into a triumph by reducing the global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.\n\nPrime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley described the mitigation, finance, and adaptation finance gaps as “immoral and unjust.” She called for an annual increase in International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights of USD 500 billion per year, for 20 years, to finance the transition, underscoring that a 2°C future is a “death sentence” for the people of vulnerable countries.\n\nA youth representative from Chile, in a video message, urged leaders to listen to young people, take into account the knowledge of civil society, and work locally to have global impact.\n\nA youth representative from Egypt, in a video message, shared lessons from his experience working with local communities, stressing opportunities to achieve economic empowerment through green initiatives.\n\nWeThe15 campaign ambassador Edward Ndopu reminded leaders of their extraordinary power to change the trajectory the world is on and urged them to help guarantee a safer future for every life.\n\nPrime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi called on COP 26 to go further than the G20, urging intelligent use of the tens of trillions of private funds available, and calling on the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to share risks the private sector cannot bear alone.\n\nDelegates viewed a video animation of a poem written by eight-year-old Delphine, which won the UK’s “Our Planet Now” competition.\n\nElizabeth Wathuti, Kenyan youth climate and environmental activist, reminded leaders that their decisions at COP 26 will determine whether children will have food and water.\n\nStatements from Leaders: Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sánchez announced an allocation of USD 30 million to the Adaptation Fund in 2022 and a commitment to increase its climate finance by 50% by 2025, to EUR 1.35 billion per year, and to allocate 20% of its Special Drawing Rights to vulnerable countries.\n\nUS President Joseph Biden expressed determination to demonstrate that the US is not only back at the table but also leading by example. He announced the United States’ first: long-term strategy to achieve net zero emissions no later than 2050; adaptation communication; and contribution to the Adaptation Fund. He stated the intention to quadruple US climate finance by 2024. He also announced the launch, with the EU, of the Global Methane Pledge, through which over 70 countries commit to collectively reduce methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.\n\nPresident of Indonesia Joko Widodo said his country’s forestry and land use sector, which contributes 60% of Indonesia’s emissions, will become a net carbon sink by 2030. Saying his country will continue to mobilize climate finance and innovative financing, including green bonds, he enquired how much support will be available from developed countries to developing countries.\n\nLamenting that small island states suffer the consequences of industrialization and climate change, and highlighting that COVID-19 wiped away 75% of his country’s tourism industry, President of Seychelles Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan called for an end to using a high-income status as a criterion for support, and instead adopting a “vulnerability index.”\n\nNoting that current pledges would take the world to 2.7°C of global warming, French President Emmanuel Macron called for pledges and strategies to reduce the gap to the 1.5°C target before the closure of COP 26. He called for linking the climate, biodiversity, and trade agendas, and for trade agreements to reflect climate commitments.\n\nPresident of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba said his country is the most carbon-positive country in the world, has adopted a climate law, and will submit a new NDC after Glasgow. He called on major economies to submit new NDCs in line with 1.5°C, proposed a “Marshall Plan on climate,” and urged developed countries to increase the collective climate finance goal by tenfold beyond 2025 to meet developing countries’ needs.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged developed countries’ responsibility to lead on climate action. She assured developed countries will achieve the USD 100 billion target by 2023 and Germany will increase its climate finance to EUR 6 billion per year by 2025. She also stressed the need for carbon pricing.\n\nPrime Minister of Jamaica Andrew Holness urged all countries to act responsibly with the ambition to preserve the planet for current and future generations. He said for small island states, funding is critical to climate action, particularly for loss and damage.\n\nPresident of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta underscored the nexus between climate change and security, highlighting the impact of extreme weather events on the African continent. He said Kenya is “doing her fair share,” outlining expectations that COP 26 will deliver on ambition, finance, adaptation, loss and damage, and implementing the Paris Agreement.\n\nPrime Minister of Fiji Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said the world is losing the race to net zero and urged high-polluting countries to halve their emissions by 2030. He emphasized that the existence of lowland and island countries is not negotiable, and that parties have the moral obligation to protect the future of our children and grandchildren.\n\nPrime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina underscored that all major emitters must submit and implement ambitious NDCs and developed countries must fulfill their financial promises. As Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, she called for a “climate emergency pact.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recalled the devastation in the village of Lytton due to wildfires. He characterized his country’s carbon pricing trajectory as one of the most ambitious in the world and called on all to work together and step up.\n\nPresident of Bolivia Luis Arce denounced “carbon colonialism” and green capitalism, calling for a paradigm shift in economic and social systems to defend Mother Earth. He stressed the principle of CBDR and historic responsibility, urging developed countries to lead.\n\nPresident of the Republic of Korea Jae-in Moon outlined promises to cut emissions by 40% below 2018 levels by 2030, join the Global Methane Pledge, and drive cooperation on forest restoration. He proposed regular youth engagement in climate decision making.\n\nPresident of the European Council Charles Michel said activists are right to demand more, and leaders have a duty not to be found wanting.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen highlighted the need for strong commitments to reduce emissions by 2030, a robust framework of rules to make global carbon markets a reality, and scaled-up climate finance.\n\nPrime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced five new targets: increasing non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 Gigawatts by 2030; fulfilling 50% of energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030; reducing 1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions between now and 2030; reducing carbon intensity by 45% by 2030; and achieving net zero emissions by 2070. Citing the need to match finance with increasing ambition, he urged developed countries to provide USD 1 trillion of climate finance as soon as possible and proposed to set up a tracking system of climate finance to put pressure on countries that have not lived up to their finance commitments.\n\nConference of the Parties\n\nOrganizational Matters: Parties elected Alok Sharma, UK, as COP 26/CMP 16/CMA 3 President by acclamation.\n\nRules of procedure: Parties agreed to apply the draft rules of procedure (FCCC/CP/1996/2), with the exception of draft rule 42 on voting.\n\nAdoption of the agenda: COP 26 President Sharma noted consultations on the agenda and outlined the Presidency’s proposals regarding the new agenda items proposed by parties. On proposals by Gabon, for the African Group, and Bolivia related to adaptation on the COP and CMA agendas, Sharma proposed that the CMA agenda include an item on “matters relating to adaptation” that will include the reports of the Adaptation Committee for 2019 and 2020, the report of the Adaptation Committee for 2021, and the work on the global goal on adaptation. On the African Group’s proposal for additional sub-items under a COP item on the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), he proposed including a footnote that recognizes the African Group’s proposal. He suggested holding presidency consultations on these matters.\n\nCOP 26 President Sharma further suggested addressing two proposals under “existing” items:\n\na stocktake on financial support and means of implementation for alternative policy approaches, proposed by Bolivia, to be addressed as part of the SCF and guidance to the GCF discussions; and\n\nequitable geographic representation in constituted bodies, proposed by Georgia, to be addressed during consultations on nominations to constituted bodies.\n\nCOP 26 Presidency Sharma proposed presidency consultations in lieu of adding the following items to the agendas:\n\nspecial needs and special circumstances of Africa, proposed by Gabon, for the African Group; and\n\nreporting and review pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement (enhanced transparency framework): provision of financial and capacity-building support to developing countries, proposed by Switzerland, for the EIG.\n\nIn the closing plenary, COP 26 President Sharma reported that consultations on these items had not led to consensus to add the issues to the agenda.\n\nOn Bolivia’s proposal for a COP agenda item on equitable, fair, ambitious and urgent real emissions reductions now consistent with a trajectory to reduce the temperature below 1.5°C, COP 26 President Sharma suggested the issue would be addressed in presidency-led consultations on the overarching cover decisions of the meeting and events such as the World Leaders Summit, Science and Innovation Day, and sessions on the IPCC WG I report. BOLIVIA lamented the exclusion of the item. She stressed the need for developed countries to acknowledge historical responsibility by undertaking immediate emissions reductions and compensating developing countries.\n\nTIMOR-LESTE requested to consider the item on WIM under both the COP and CMA. COP 26 President Sharma confirmed that there will be presidency consultations on loss and damage.\n\nVENEZUELA called for including the impacts of unilateral coercive measures on climate change and climate action on the COP and CMA agendas. Suggesting the existing agendas are conducive to such discussions and noting extensive agenda consultations, COP 26 President Sharma appealed to parties to proceed with the adoption of the agenda.\n\nAccepting these proposals, the COP adopted the agenda (FCCC/CP/2021/1/Add.2), holding in abeyance items on proposals for amendments to the Convention and the second review of the adequacy of Article 4.2(a-b) of the Convention (on Annex I parties’ mitigation commitments).\n\nUKRAINE proposed, and parties agreed, to defer the consideration of the item on reporting and review of Annex I parties.\n\nElection of officers other than the President: Parties elected as Vice-Presidents Ephraim Mwepya Shitima (Zambia), Gabriela Fischerova (Slovakia), Carlos Fuller (Belize), Javier Gutiérrez Ramírez (Nicaragua) and Anne Rasmussen (Samoa). COP 26 President Sharma noted that the nomination for the Asia-Pacific was outstanding and encouraged the region to notify the Secretariat as soon as possible. Tosi Mpanu continued as SBSTA Chair, and Marianne Karlsen continued as SBI Chair. Iryna Stavchuk (Ukraine) was elected as Rapporteur.\n\nAdmission of observers: The COP admitted the observers seeking accreditation (FCCC/CP/2021/7).\n\nCredentials: The COP adopted the report on credentials (FCCC/CP/2021/11).\n\nDates and venues: Parties agreed that COP 27 will take place on 7-18 November 2022 in Egypt and COP 28 will take place 6-17 November 2023 in the United Arab Emirates (FCCC/CP/2021/L.1).\n\nReports of the Subsidiary Bodies: SBI: The COP took note of the report and the oral report of SBI 52-55 (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.1). The COP adopted the decision on the review of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention, now named the Glasgow work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.18). The COP adopted the decision on national adaptation plans recommended by the SBI (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.11/Add.1).\n\nSBSTA: The COP took note of the report and the oral report of SBSTA 52-55 (FCCC/SBSTA/2021/L.1). The COP adopted the decision on the LCIPP as recommended by the SBSTA (FCCC/SBSTA/2021/L.3).\n\nReporting to and from Annex I Parties: This item was deferred to COP 27.\n\nReporting to and from Non-Annex I Parties: Report and terms of reference of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) (2020 and 2021): This item relates to the reports (FCCC/SBI/2020/15 and FCCC/SBI/2021/12) and future of the CGE, which assists developing countries in fulfilling their reporting requirements. The item was first taken up in the SBI plenary on Sunday, 31 October, and referred to informal consultations, co-facilitated by Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Sin Liang Cheah (Singapore).\n\nIn informal consultations under the SBI, a developing country called for insights from the CGE’s report on capacity-building needs in preparing national communications and biennial update reports (FCCC/TP/2021/2) to inform deliberations on guidance to the CGE. Some developed countries noted discussions should also address the composition of the CGE, highlighting the terms of reference “erroneously overlooked” non-Annex I parties in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn its closing plenary on Saturday, 6 November, the SBI noted that parties were unable to conclude consideration of the review and revision of the terms of reference (ToR) of the CGE, and forwarded the matter to the COP Presidency.\n\nIn informal consultations under the COP, discussions on the revised ToR focused on whether to, inter alia: include specific reference to Africa alongside LDCs and small island developing states (SIDS), or alternatively, use a more general reference to “most vulnerable countries” as needing special consideration; and remove a general provision that the CGE shall implement any other mandates provided by the CMA.\n\nSBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/ SBI/2021/L.9), the SBI:\n\nwelcomes the CGE’s reports;\n\nacknowledges the CGE’s achievements in implementing its workplans for 2020 and 2021; and\n\nextends its appreciation to the parties that financially supported the CGE’s work in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCOP Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.12), the COP, inter alia:\n\nadopts the revised ToR of the CGE, annexed to the decision;\n\ndecides that the representative of non-Annex I parties that are not part of the established constituencies previously represented on the CGE shall participate in the work of the CGE in the same capacity as the other members of the CGE;\n\ndecides to include in the composition of the CGE, in addition to current members from non-Annex I parties, one additional member from the LDCs and one from SIDS; and\n\nrequests SBI 62 (2025) to initiate consideration of the extension of the term of the CGE after 2026, the composition of the CGE and its terms of reference, with a view to recommending a draft decision to COP 30 (2025).\n\nReport of the Adaptation Committee (for 2019 and 2020): Parties first considered the reports (FCCC/SB/2019/3 and FCCC/SB/2020/2) in plenary and referred the issue to the SBI and SBSTA. Under the subsidiary bodies, there was also discussion of the 2021 Adaptation Committee Report (FCCC/SB/2021/6, and 6/Corr.1). Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Paul Watkinson (France) and Le-Anne Roper (Jamaica) on three matters jointly: reports of the Committee (2019, 2020, and 2021); the global goal on adaptation (GGA); and review of the Committee’s progress, effectiveness, and performance. On Saturday, 6 November, the SBI and SBSTA adopted conclusions. Decisions were recommended to the COP on the 2019 and 2020 reports, and to the CMA on the 2021 report and the GGA (which is summarized under the CMA).\n\nIn informal consultations, parties exchanged views on whether, inter alia: the Committee should engage with the IPCC; linkages should be made with the Global Stocktake; and the GGA has already been defined. Parties discussed whether to “note” or “welcome” the 2019 Adaptation Committee report; resume meetings in person or virtually, noting challenges some parties face with air travel for in-person events, and internet stability for virtual meetings. Parties also debated whether the review of the Committee’s progress, effectiveness, and performance should be concluded at COP 26, or conducted at COP 27.\n\nParties also exchanged views on focal points. Some developing countries suggested separate focal points for adaptation matters, while others preferred coordinating with the Convention’s national focal points to engage with the Convention’s other workstreams, due to resource constraints.\n\nViews diverged on whether there should be two or three decisions on adaptation matters: some preferred two, following the COP and CMA agenda items; others preferred three, highlighting the need for a separate decision on the GGA. Parties considered the timeline and modalities of a work programme on the GGA.\n\nIn the closing plenary, the SBI and SBSTA adopted conclusions.\n\nSBI/SBSTA Conclusions: In their conclusions (FCCC/SB/2021/L.2), the SBI and SBSTA:\n\nconsidered but did not conclude their consideration of the Committee’s reports for 2019, 2020 and 2021, including the matters referred to them by COP 26, including the review of the progress, effectiveness and performance of the Adaptation Committee, and CMA 3, including the work on the GGA; and\n\nagree to forward consideration of these matters to COP 26 and CMA 3, taking into account the text prepared by the Co-Facilitators.\n\nCOP Decision: In its decision (FCCC/PA/COP/L.11), the COP, inter alia:\n\nrequests the Adaptation Committee to resume holding its regular meetings in person, with the option of virtual attendance to ensure inclusive participation;\n\ninvites parties to identify one or more adaptation contact points through their UNFCCC national contact points to enhance information dissemination across Convention workstreams; and\n\ninvites CMA 4 to participate in the review of the Committee’s progress, effectiveness, and performance as it relates to the Paris Agreement, and invites parties to submit views no later than three months before COP 27.\n\nWarsaw International Mechanism (WIM): Parties considered the 2020 and 2021 reports of the Executive Committee of the WIM (FCCC/SB/2020/3 and 4) in plenary. Informal consultations convened jointly under the SBSTA and SBI, co-facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Cornelia Jaeger (Austria).\n\nIn informal consultations, delegates discussed operationalizing the Santiago Network, including its form and functions, and financial support for loss and damage. Views diverged on the extent to which the functions of the Santiago Network should be elaborated in this decision, with some calling to consider both form and function together in subsequent work under the SBs, while others stressed that form follows function.\n\nOn function, several developing country groups put forward ideas for operationalizing the network. These included mechanisms to identify the range, quality, and type of technical assistance available by various bodies operating at different scales, and coordination mechanisms to help developing countries identify their loss and damage needs. Some developed countries suggested leveraging the convening power of the Network, while another said it should do more. Developing countries stressed the Network should not simply be a matchmaking facility or database.\n\nOn form, suggestions included a coordinating body or entity to be established at COP 27 and an expert advisory body to support the Network.\n\nOn financial support for loss and damage, some opposed the Executive Committee providing input to the SCF. Several groups called for adequate finance to support the Network’s operationalization and the provision of technical assistance, including from the Financial Mechanism.\n\nIn their closing plenaries on Saturday, 6 November, the SBI and SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2021/L.6), in which they forwarded a draft decision to the COP and CMA, pending ministerial consultations.\n\nIn ministerial consultations, there were recurring calls by developing countries for a financial mechanism for loss and damage. These calls also took place in the context of the overarching cover decisions. Ultimately, no such mechanism was agreed.\n\nThe governance of the WIM was also debated in ministerial consultations. Many developing countries called for the WIM to be governed by both the COP and the CMA. The US preferred that the CMA alone govern the WIM. This issue was not resolved. The WIM will continue to appear on the agendas of both the COP and CMA, with a footnote that this inclusion does not prejudge future decisions on the governance of the WIM.\n\nOn Saturday, 13 November, the COP and CMA adopted decisions.\n\nCOP/CMA Decision: In its decision (FCCC/2021/CP/L.15), the COP and CMA endorse decision FCCC/CMA3/2021/L.22. The CMA:\n\nwelcomes the WIM Executive Committee’s 2020 and 2021 reports, including adoption of plans of action on non-economic losses, slow onset events, and action and support;\n\ndecides the functions of the Santiago Network, including catalyzing demand-driven technical assistance for the implementation of relevant approaches to loss and damage, by identifying, prioritizing, and communicating technical assistance needs and priorities, and actively connecting those seeking technical assistance with best-suited entities;\n\ndecides to further develop the institutional arrangements of the Santiago Network, including by inviting submissions on operational modalities, structure, the role of the Executive Committee, and possible elements for the terms of reference of a potential convening or coordinating body; and\n\nrecognizes the urgent need for scaling-up of action and support, including finance, for loss and damage, and encourages the Executive Committee to continue engaging with the SCF and to explore potential ways to enhance collaboration with the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism.\n\nMatters Related to Finance: Long-term finance: The programme on long-term finance has featured workshops, high-level events, and reports from developed countries on how their strategies and plans to scale up finance toward meeting the 2020 goal of providing USD 100 bn per year. It was due to conclude in 2020. This item was first referred to a contact group, co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Georg Børsting (Norway), and subsequently dealt with in informal consultations and “informal informals.” Presidency-led consultations also convened.\n\nIn informal consultations, parties discussed whether the item should remain on the COP agenda, how to address the USD 100 billion by 2020 goal, a definition of climate finance, and scaling up adaptation finance.\n\nDeveloping countries stressed that provision of finance is a treaty obligation under the Convention, preferring this item to remain under the COP. Developed countries said implementation is taking place under the Paris Agreement, cautioning against proliferation of agenda items.\n\nOn the USD 100 billion by 2020 goal, developing countries called for assessing and reviewing delivery towards the goal until 2025. They favored official UNFCCC synthesis reports, and continuing discussions under this agenda item until at least 2027. Views diverged on how to reflect the state of play on the goal, with developing countries expressing disappointment at its failure.\n\nDeveloping countries called for a definition of climate finance to be agreed by COP 28, opposed by developed countries who said this was out of scope for the item and duplicative of the discussion under the SCF. One developed country cautioned that any agreed definition would have implications for reporting on support and what counts as climate action.\n\nDeveloping countries proposed scaling up adaptation finance, with developed countries objecting.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.14), the COP, inter alia:\n\nnotes with serious concern the gap in relation to the fulfillment of the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020, including due to challenges in mobilizing finance from private sources;\n\nurges developed country parties to continue to scale up climate finance towards achieving the goal to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020;\n\nrequests the SCF to continue its work on definitions of climate finance, taking into account the submissions received from parties, to provide input for consideration by COP 27;\n\nrequests the SCF to undertake further work on mapping the available information relevant to Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, including its reference to Article 9 (finance), with a view to providing input for consideration by COP 27;\n\ndecides that continued discussions on long-term climate finance will conclude in 2027;\n\nrequests the SCF to prepare a report in 2022 on progress towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, taking into account the Climate Finance Delivery Plan and other relevant reports, for consideration by COP 27, and to continue to contribute to assessing the achievement of the goal in the context of the preparation of its biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows;\n\ndecides to convene biennial high-level ministerial dialogues on climate finance in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and requests the COP Presidency to summarize the deliberations at the dialogues for consideration by the COP in the year thereafter;\n\ninvites the COP 27 Presidency to organize the high-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance in 2022 on the progress and fulfillment of the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020; and\n\nrequests that the actions of the Secretariat called for in this decision be undertaken subject to the availability of financial resources.\n\nStanding Committee on Finance: The SCF was established to provide technical support to the COP in matters relating to the Financial Mechanism. Its aims include improving coherence and coordination in the delivery of finance, mobilizing resources, and measuring, reporting, and verifying support provided to developing countries. Parties considered reports of the SCF (FCCC/CP/2020/4-FCCC/PA/CMA/2020/3 and FCCC/CP/2021/10-FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/7) in plenary and in a joint COP and CMA contact group was co-chaired by Gard Lindseth (Norway) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania). Presidency-led consultations were required during the second week, in parallel to continued informal consultations.\n\nIn contact group and informal consultations, parties discussed the fourth biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows and the first report on the determination of the needs of developing country parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement (NDR).\n\nOn the biennial assessment, many expressed disappointment that, for the first time, the report does not include recommendations, which one group indicated was in part due to a lack of agreement on a definition of climate finance. Developing country groups highlighted: UN climate funds comprise 0.34% of global finance flows; finance for mitigation and adaptation is unbalanced; there is decreasing funding for SIDS; there is not a fair allocation of resources for Africa; and the finance from multilateral development banks includes non-concessional loans. They called for improving methodologies, particularly for the mobilization of finance and for “other private finance,” and for defining climate finance.\n\nDeveloped countries welcomed, among others: the 16% increase in climate finance flows; decreased unit costs, particularly in renewable energy; and the investors representing USD 90 trillion of assets that signed on to the Principles for Responsible Investment. A developed country suggested further disaggregating finance flows between public and private sources that provide finance to LDCs and SIDS in future biennial assessments.\n\nSeveral highlighted the inclusion of Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c), which calls for making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. Many developing countries highlighted the need for better operationalization and methodologies for the article.\n\nA developing country group also noted several key issues raised by the SCF report, including that, inter alia: only 21% of bilateral climate finance has been for adaptation; climate finance must be new and additional; the current level of climate finance is insufficient; and more funding is needed to support NDC implementation.\n\nOn the NDR, two developing country groups called for better, and quantitative, inclusion of loss and damage. Another developing country group noted that needs will evolve as developing countries update their NDCs, and that countries used different methodologies to assess their needs. Several emphasized the need for capacity building.\n\nSome developed countries said the report should be considered in broad terms that include capacity building, technology, policy reforms, and the Sustainable Development Goals and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. One highlighted the need for greater disaggregation of information on needs and suggested that the report feature more inputs from developing countries with greater capacity to identify needs.\n\nOn Thursday, 11 November, in Presidency-led consultations, a representative of the COP 26 Presidency highlighted remaining issues, including the definition of climate finance, and the governance of the SCF review. Parties continued to discuss draft text and reached agreement on Saturday, 13 November.\n\nCOP Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.9), the COP, inter alia:\n\nwelcomes the 2020 and 2021 reports of the SCF;\n\nwelcomes the fourth (2020) Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows of the SCF;\n\nnotes that global climate finance flows were 16% higher in 2017–2018 than in 2015–2016, reaching an annual average of USD 775 billion; the 2017–2018 annual average of public financial support reported by parties included in Annex II to the Convention in their biennial reports (USD 48.7 billion) represents an increase of 2.7% from the annual average reported for 2015–2016; the annual average of climate finance from multilateral development banks’ own resources to developing countries and emerging economies (USD 36.6 billion) represents a 50% increase since 2015–2016; and UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds approved USD 2.2 billion and USD 3.1 billion for climate finance projects in 2017 and 2018, respectively;\n\ncalls upon developed country parties and other climate finance providers to continue to enhance the harmonization of methodologies for tracking and reporting climate finance provided and mobilized;\n\nrecognizes the fact that there is no multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance, notes the submissions received in response to decisions 11/CP.25 and 5/CMA.2, which highlighted that some parties noted how the lack of a common definition impacts the ability to track and assess climate finance, while other parties mentioned that a single definition would not be useful, and also notes that the operational definitions in use generally reflect common understanding of what is considered mitigation and adaptation finance;\n\nrequests the SCF to continue its work on definitions of climate finance, taking into account the submissions received from parties on this matter, with a view to providing input for consideration by the COP at COP 27 (November 2022);\n\nencourages parties to ensure that just transition financing is incorporated into approaches to align climate action with the goals of the Paris Agreement;\n\nwelcomes the first report by the SCF on the determination of the needs of developing country parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and endorses its key findings and recommendations, as contained in Annex II;\n\nnotes that NDCs from 153 parties included 4,274 needs, with 1,782 costed needs identified across 78 NDCs, cumulatively amounting to USD 5.8–5.9 trillion through 2030, and that, although developing country parties identified more adaptation needs than mitigation needs, more costs were identified for the latter, which may not imply that mitigation needs are greater but rather that there is a lack of available data, tools, and capacity for assessing adaptation needs;\n\nexpresses its concern that the first NDR does not have disaggregated data for SIDS;\n\nemphasizes that there is a particular challenge in deriving cost estimates for climate adaptation and enhancing resilience needs and, in this context, deriving cost estimates for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage needs;\n\ninvites the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, UN agencies, multilateral and bilateral financial institutions, and other relevant institutions to make use of the information contained in the first report on the determination of the needs of developing country parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement when supporting developing country parties in identifying and costing needs;\n\nrequests the SCF, in preparing future NDRs, to continue to reach out to developing country parties and relevant developing country stakeholders when generating data and information on needs;\n\nendorses the workplan of the Standing Committee on Finance for 2022 and underlines the importance of the SCF focusing its work in 2022 in accordance with its current mandates;\n\nendorses the outline of the technical report of the fifth Biennial Assessment and underscores that this report will continue to contribute to assessing the achievement of the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation, in accordance with decision 1/CP.16;\n\nnotes that the SCF was not able to produce draft guidance to the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and that it has not agreed on recommendations from the fourth (2020) Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows, and in this regard requests the Committee to improve its working modalities;\n\nrequests the SCF to report to COP 27 on its progress in implementing its 2022 workplan; and\n\nrequests the SCF to consider the guidance provided to it in other relevant decisions of the COP.\n\nReport of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and guidance to the GCF (2020 and 2021): Parties considered the reports of the GCF to the COP (FCCC/CP/2021/5 and 8) in plenary. A contact group was established, co-chaired by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Toru Sugio (Japan).\n\nIn contact group and informal consultations, the Co-Chairs encouraged parties to use an SCF Co-Facilitators’ proposed draft guidance contained in an addendum to the report of the SCF as the basis of the discussion, which the US supported. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, noted that the SCF was unable to conclude its deliberation on the draft guidance, and opposed using it as a basis for negotiation.\n\nParties discussed the work of the GCF, challenges developing countries face in receiving funding from the GCF, and how to provide guidance to the GCF.\n\nOn the work of the GCF, BOLIVIA questioned why alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, were not taken into consideration in the GCF’s 2020-2023 workplan. The EU stressed the difficulty of discussing finance separately from other issues such as technology and adaptation, and indicated that several elements in the group’s submissions were not included in the draft guidance, including a mention of the 1.5°C target. Colombia, for AILAC, proposed several areas for improvement for the GCF including: efficiency and transparency; funding projects with co-benefits; increasing grants to indebted middle- and upper-middle-income countries; and providing loans in national currencies. Switzerland, for the EIG, proposed improving coherence with other financial institutions and enhancing national ownership of projects. The group suspended, as parties disagreed on whether the Co-Chairs could issue a new text to serve as a basis for negotiation.\n\nOn challenges for developing countries, Antigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, underscored the need to highlight the unique challenges that SIDS face in accessing climate finance, including lack of loss and damage finance and high transaction costs of project applications. Citing a project proposal that has been waiting four years for a funding decision, Malawi, for the LDCs, indicated funds are not always accessible for developing countries, and urged reconsidering project-by-project accreditation procedures.\n\nOn the guidance to the GCF, the EU called for prioritizing projects with the highest impact and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Fund’s decision making. Antigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, supported by CANADA, called for requiring all financial flows from the operating entities and trustees of the Financial Mechanism to be aligned with Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (consistency of financial flows with a pathway towards low-emissions and climate-resilient development). NORWAY, supported by CANADA and the US, said GCF guidance should remain at a strategic level to avoid micromanaging the GCF Board, with the US adding it should, however, not shy away from taking steps to increase efficiency. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, raised concern about the imposition of unilateral funding access conditions on Board members and developing countries, and reminded it could not accept the Co-Facilitators’ proposed draft guidance submitted to the SCF.\n\nOne group queried the inclusion of loss and damage, noting the GCF is currently struggling to provide resources to match demand. Others called for stronger language on loss and damage. A developing country group stressed the need to avoid pre-empting the GCF Board’s workplan, and to avoid mandating the COP to carry out activities for which it does not have authority. Another group said the COP has a mandate to give guidance to the GCF.\n\nParticular areas of disagreement related to references to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and women and gender balance on the GCF Board. One developing country group requested a specific reference to supporting national adaptation plan (NAP) readiness.\n\nAfter several rounds of deliberations, parties reached agreement on Friday, 12 November, and the COP adopted the decision.\n\nFinal Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.6), the COP, inter alia:\n\nwelcomes the reports of the GCF, including the list of actions taken by the GCF Board in response to guidance received from the COP;\n\nencourages further collaboration and engagement between the GCF, the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), through continued joint work, as well as collaboration on events, and taking into consideration elements related to gender mainstreaming and observer engagement;\n\nreiterates the request to the GCF Board to continue efforts to maintain the balance in the allocation of resources between adaptation and mitigation;\n\nurges the GCF Board to finalize in a timely manner its work related to the guidance and arrangements of the COP on financing for forests and alternative approaches, as mandated by COP 21; and\n\nrequests the GCF Board to include in its annual report to the COP information on the steps it has taken to implement the guidance provided in this decision.\n\nReport of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and guidance to the GEF (2020 and 2021): Parties considered reports of the GEF to the COP (FCCC/CP/2020/1 and 9) in plenary. A contact group was established, co-chaired by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Toru Sugio (Japan).\n\nIn contact group and informal consultations, parties discussed how to provide guidance to the GEF. The EU suggested reflecting the collaboration between the private sector and GEF trustees. The US, CANADA, NORWAY, and Switzerland, for the EIG, underscored that the guidance should not be prescriptive. When discussing draft text, two developed country parties called to delete a paragraph on increasing grants to middle- and upper-income countries, saying it prejudges the GEF replenishment process. One opposed a new line of support for loss and damage in the context of the LDC Fund (LDCF), saying loss and damage is part of adaptation. One group called to delete a paragraph relating to improving access or creating a new window, stating that so far, all funding requests have been approved.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda, for AOSIS, indicated that GEF funding should be predictable and adequate, calling for more direct finance for SIDS and no conditionality related to co-financing. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said he could not agree with many things in the draft guidance, and called on the GEF to step up direct access, otherwise it would be a “dinosaur institution.” Colombia, on behalf of AILAC, suggested increasing funding for increasingly indebted middle- and upper-middle-income countries.\n\nA developing country group stressed the GEF will primarily receive contributions from developed country parties, and those developing country parties who contribute voluntarily do not need to be encouraged. A developing country stressed CBDR-RC. Another said Annex I countries should contribute to the LDCF and the Special Climate Change Fund. A developing country group highlighted the need for: dedicated seats for SIDS at the GEF Council; more resourcing for capacity-building needs for transparency; opening the GEF Partnership to ensure access for SIDS; and alterations to the co-financing ratios. Another stressed the importance of loss and damage and capacity building.\n\nParties reached agreement on Friday, 12 November and the COP adopted the decision.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.8), the COP, inter alia:\n\nwelcomes the reports of the GEF and their addenda, including the responses of the GEF to guidance received from the COP;\n\nwelcomes the work undertaken by the GEF during its reporting period (1 July 2019 to 30 June 2021);\n\nencourages the GEF, as part of the eighth replenishment process, to duly consider ways to increase the financial resources allocated for climate action, including the climate change focal area and climate co-benefits, and to apply a coherent approach across its focal areas to prioritize projects that generate environmental co-benefits;\n\ncalls upon developed country parties to make financial contributions to the GEF to contribute to a robust eighth replenishment to support developing countries in implementing the Convention, and encourages additional voluntary financial contributions to the eighth replenishment;\n\ncalls upon the GEF to continue to improve the governance framework for its agencies and the standards to which the implementing partners are accountable;\n\nurges the GEF to enhance its support for projects that engage with stakeholders at the local level, and to continue to provide funding for projects related to technology training and scale up South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation with the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the CTCN;\n\nrequests the GEF, as part of the eighth replenishment process, to take note of the needs and priorities for climate finance, including those identified in the first report on the determination of the needs of developing country parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, NDCs, national communications and NAPs, as well as in other sources of available information, including the biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows and other relevant reports;\n\nrequests the SCF to consider the submissions of parties when preparing its draft guidance for the GEF for consideration by COP 27 and CMA 4 (November 2022); and\n\nrequests the GEF to include in its annual report to the COP information on the steps it has taken to implement the guidance provided in this decision.\n\nSeventh review of the Financial Mechanism: On Sunday, 31 October, a contact group was established, co-chaired by Eva Schreuder (Netherlands) and Daniela Veas (Chile). Discussions focused on the relationship between the review and the CMA, and the relationship between the review and the replenishment processes of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism.\n\nSwitzerland, for the EIG, suggested that the review take into account the Paris Agreement and said the CMA should be part of the review, as the Financial Mechanism also serves the Paris Agreement. Costa Rica for AILAC, CANADA, the EU, and the US supported the proposal.\n\nSouth Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by INDIA and Saudi Arabia for the ARAB GROUP, cautioned parties that the Financial Mechanism serves the needs of developing countries, not the Paris Agreement. AILAC proposed that the SCF submit the report of the review to COP 27 and CMA 4.\n\nOn replenishment, a developing country group cautioned that language on the review informing the replenishment processes of the operating entities should reflect the COP’s memoranda of understanding with the entities, noting that some criteria are specific to the GEF, such as country allocation and co-financing.\n\nDuring the closing plenary, COP 26 President Sharma reported that parties were unable to reach agreement on this matter. Applying Rule 16 of the draft rules of procedure, the issue will be placed on the agenda for COP 27 and documents developed during this meeting will not be forwarded for further consideration.\n\nCompilation and synthesis of, and summary report on the in-session workshop on, biennial communications of information related to Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement (ex ante finance transparency): Parties considered the first biennial communications in accordance with Article 9.5 (FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/3), and the biennial in-session workshop on information to be provided by parties in accordance with Article 9.5 (FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/5) in plenary. A contact group was co-chaired by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Georg Børsting (Norway).\n\nIn contact group and informal consultations, parties discussed the elements of the draft COP decision. Egypt, for the AFRICAN GROUP, and INDIA called for including most of the same elements as in the CMA decision and adding a component relating to the predictability of long-term finance under the COP. The EU supported mirroring the CMA decision but opposed further additions. The US, supported by Switzerland, for the EIG, expressed preference for a procedural decision, noting that the Article 9.5 communications are pursuant to the Paris Agreement alone. Several countries suggested that the COP decision should be short and “take note of” the CMA decision.\n\nThe COP adopted the decision on Saturday, 13 November.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.7), the COP, inter alia:\n\nwelcomes the compilation and synthesis prepared by the Secretariat of the information contained in the first biennial communications in accordance with Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement;\n\nwelcomes the summary report on the biennial in-session workshop on information to be provided by parties in accordance with Article 9.5 of the Paris Agreement held 11 June 2021; and\n\ntakes note of the CMA decision on the same matter.\n\nDevelopment and Transfer of Technologies: Joint report of the TEC and CTCN (2020 and 2021): This item was referred to the SBSTA and SBI, where parties first considered the joint annual reports for 2020 and 2021 (FCCC/SBI/2020/4, 2021/5) in plenary. These bodies seek to provide support for developing countries to identify technology-related needs and match them with technology providers, in the case of the CTCN. Stella Gama (Malawi) and Toshiaki Nagata (Japan) co-facilitated informal consultations. On Saturday, 6 November, the SBSTA and the SBI adopted conclusions, which include a draft COP decision that was adopted by the COP on Friday, 12 November.\n\nIn informal consultations, parties discussed, inter alia: how to mention engagement with the private sector; whether to commend the TEC’s work on gender mainstreaming; and whether to reference “sector-focused approaches” when discussing the CTCN’s activities.\n\nOn the draft decision related to the TEC’s activities, developed countries proposed a new paragraph to note the role of the private sector. Many parties supported this addition, with some suggesting giving general guidance to the TEC on its work related to the private sector. One developing country proposed to delete a paragraph commending the TEC’s efforts on gender mainstreaming. Many parties opposed, underscoring the need to acknowledge the TEC’s work on gender and achievement of gender balance in its events in 2021.\n\nOne party lamented the lack of geographic balance in the membership of the TEC, suggesting adding a paragraph noting that some countries are prevented from fully participating in the Committee’s work. Several parties indicated the TEC membership is a cross-cutting issue, and Co-Facilitator Nagata encouraged parties to engage in the Presidency’s consultation on the election of officers.\n\nOn the draft decision related to the CTCN’s activities, many parties proposed to omit “the implementation of sector-focused approaches,” noting lack of clarity for the term “sector-focused.” A developed country opposed, indicating that mentioning “sector-focused” will not exclude any sectors but help identify priority areas for the CTCN’s work.\n\nAfter several rounds of informal consultations and informal informals, parties agreed on draft text.\n\nIn their closing plenaries, the SBSTA and SBI adopted conclusions and forwarded draft decisions to the COP and CMA, which were adopted on Friday, 12 November.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/SB/2021/L.4), the COP, inter alia:\n\nwelcomes the joint annual reports of the TEC and CTCN for 2020 and 2021 and commends the efforts to advance their work amid the pandemic;\n\nwelcomes the continuing collaboration of the TEC and CTCN and invites them to strengthen it;\n\nwelcomes the collaboration between the TEC and the Financial Mechanism and encourages the continuation of this collaboration; and\n\nwelcomes the implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems of TEC and CTCN and requests them to continue reporting.\n\nLinkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism: This item is summarized under the SBI.\n\nReview of the constitution of the Advisory Board of the CTCN: In the opening plenary, the COP referred this item to the SBI, which conducted informal consultations, co-facilitated by Federica Fricano (Italy) and Mareer Husny (Maldives).\n\nIn informal consultations, parties discussed how to amend the constitution of the CTCN Advisory Board to increase representation of all UN regional groups and UNFCCC observer organization constituencies. A non-Annex I country suggested increasing the number of Advisory Board members from 16 to 18, and ensuring equitable representation from each UNFCCC geographic regional group. A group stressed the need for a LDC representative on the Board. One developed country agreed with the need to enhance the representation of some developing countries, but preferred not to increase the number of Board members. Several countries also suggested including representatives of Indigenous Peoples’ organizations, YOUNGOs, and Women and Gender. Another developed country underscored the need for: balance among Annex I countries, non-Annex I countries, and NGOs; balance among regions; and ensuring the organization’s efficiency. Parties were able to reach a consensus and on Friday, 12 November, the COP adopted the decision.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.3), the COP agreed to amend the constitution of the Advisory Board of CTCN by, inter alia:\n\nchanging the number of government representatives from 16 to 18 to ensure equitable representation of UN regional groups;\n\nadding representatives for Indigenous Peoples’ organizations, the women and gender constituency, and YOUNGOs; and\n\nincreasing the maximum term of board members from one to two years.\n\nSecond review of the CTCN: In the opening plenary, parties agreed to conduct informal consultations on this agenda item. In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Madeleine Diouf Sarr (Senegal) and Stephen Minas (Greece), parties discussed, inter alia, whether or not to specify the challenges that the CTCN faces identified by the review, how to draw the conclusions regarding financial resources of the CTCN, and how to reference the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).\n\nOn challenges identified by the review, a party noted that projected funding for the CTCN will be inadequate and suggested adding specific language on strengthening the CTCN’s efforts on resource mobilization and diversifying its funding sources. Several developing countries suggested specifying the challenges the CTCN faces in three respects, namely financial challenges, management and administrative challenges, and challenges to improving work relationships with national designated entities and network members. Some developed countries preferred to not specify different challenges. Several developing countries also suggested requesting the UNFCCC Secretariat to support the CTCN’s resource mobilization efforts.\n\nOn financial aspects, many developing countries suggested noting the lack of a dedicated framework for allocating resources from the Financial Mechanism to the CTCN, and inviting the CTCN to work with the operational entities of the Financial Mechanism to further strengthen their linkages. Developed countries strongly objected to this proposal and asked to bracket all paragraphs on financial aspects. One developed country said it is inappropriate to add new substantive text at a late stage of the negotiations, noting the issue of linkages between the Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism should be addressed in the negotiations on guidance to the GCF and GEF. A developing country said his group’s proposal on linkages was not taken up in the finance negotiations.\n\nOn UNIDO, a developed country proposed, supported by several parties, specifying UNIDO’s role as a co-host of the CTCN. A developing country group insisted that the COP does not have the mandate to give guidance to UNIDO because the UNFCCC Secretariat does not have a memorandum of understanding with UNIDO.\n\nAfter bilateral consultations, parties put forward a proposal, which, inter alia, reiterates that enhanced and sustainable financial support should be provided to the CTCN for its full and effective implementation; encourages the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with UNIDO and in consultation with the CTCN Advisory Board, to implement the recommendations of the review; and invites the CTCN to continue working with the operational entities of the Financial Mechanism to further strengthen their linkages.\n\nOn Friday, 12 November, the COP adopted the decision.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.5), the COP, inter alia:\n\nnotes the key findings of the second independent review regarding the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of the services provided by the CTCN;\n\nnotes the main successes and challenges regarding the effective implementation of the CTCN, as contained in the review report;\n\ndecides to renew the memorandum of understanding between the COP and UNEP regarding the hosting of the CTCN, as contained in Annex I to decision 14/CP.18, for a further five-year period;\n\nencourages UNEP as host of the CTCN, in collaboration with UNIDO and in consultation with the Advisory Board of the CTCN, to implement the recommendations contained in the report;\n\nrequests the CTCN to include in its joint annual report with the TEC for 2022 and in the subsequent reports to the COP, through the subsidiary bodies, information on its plans and actions undertaken in response to the recommendations contained in the report;\n\nnotes that the CTCN continues to face challenges that need attention, including limited and insufficient financial resources and a constrained budget for implementing its mandates given its broad scope of services; administrative and communication challenges related to its management structure; lack of resources of the developing country national designated entities to better engage and fulfil its role; and limited engagement and synergies among the network members;\n\nencourages the CTCN to enhance its provision of support for strengthening the capacity of national designated entities in developing countries with a view to enabling them to fulfil their roles;\n\nreiterates that enhanced and sustainable financial support should be provided to the CTCN for the full and effective implementation of its mandate;\n\ninvites the CTCN to continue working with the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism to further strengthen their linkages with the aim of scaling up the CTCN’s provision of technical support to developing country parties;\n\ndecides to align the periodicity of the independent review of the effective implementation of the CTCN with the periodic assessment of the effectiveness and adequacy of the support provided to the Technology Mechanism in supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement on matters relating to technology development and transfer by changing the periodicity of the independent review from four to five years until the COP reviews the functions of the CTCN at COP 31 (2026) and decides whether to extend its term;\n\nrequests the SBI to start considering, at SBI 62 (2025), matters relating to the alignment between processes pertaining to the independent review of the CTCN and the periodic assessment of the Technology Mechanism, with a view to recommending a draft decision on this matter for consideration and adoption by COP 31;\n\nrequests the Secretariat, pursuant to decision 2/CP.17, annex VII, paragraph 20, and subject to the availability of financial resources, to commission the third independent review of the effectiveness of the CTCN for consideration at COP 31; and\n\nrequests the Secretariat to organize a dialogue, in conjunction with COP 31, to consider the findings of the third independent review of the effective implementation of the CTCN.\n\nCapacity Building under the Convention: Parties considered capacity-building work of bodies established under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol (FCCC/SBI/2021/2), and implementation of the framework for capacity building in developing countries (FCCC/SBI/2021/3 and 5). The issue was referred to the SBI, where informal consultations were co-facilitated by Rita Mishaan (Guatemala) and Ismo Ulvila (EU). On Saturday, 6 November, the SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.6), including a draft decision for the COP’s consideration. The COP adopted the decision on Thursday, 11 November.\n\nCOP Decision: In its final decision (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.6), the COP, inter alia:\n\nencourages the engagement of countries with economies in transition in future discussions to be held at the Durban Forum, as appropriate, to explore potential ways for enhancing capacity building in countries with economies in transition by sharing examples of best practices and lessons learned;\n\ninvites parties to enhance reporting on best practices related to capacity building in their national communications, biennial reports, submissions, and other relevant documents with a view to furthering learning and broadening the impact of capacity-building activities in countries with economies in transition;\n\ninvites parties included in Annex II to the Convention and other parties in a position to do so, the GEF, multilateral and bilateral agencies, international organizations, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and the private sector or any further arrangements, as appropriate and within their mandates, to continue to provide support for capacity-building activities in countries with economies in transition;\n\ninvites parties and relevant institutions to provide information on capacity-building activities in countries with economies in transition to the Secretariat for inclusion in the capacity-building portal;\n\ndecides to conclude the fifth review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building in countries with economies in transition and requests SBI 64 (2026) to initiate the sixth review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building in countries with economies in transition with a view to concluding it at SBI 64; and\n\nrequests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on implementation of the framework for capacity building in countries with economies in transition to support the sixth review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building in countries with economies in transition, for consideration at SBI 64.\n\nMatters related to LDCs: Discussions related to the LDC Expert Group (LEG), which supports LDCs in a range of adaptation-related activities. This matter was referred to the SBI and later discussed in informal consultations, co-facilitated by Giza Martins (Angola) and Jens Fugl (Denmark). Parties considered reports on LEG meetings (FCCC/SBI/2020/6, 7, 14; FCCC/SBI/2021/6 and 13) and a report on progress, need for continuation, and terms of reference (ToRs) for the LEG (FCCC/SBI/2020/8).\n\nIn its closing plenary on Saturday, 6 November, the SBI adopted conclusions and recommended a draft decision to the COP. On Thursday, 11 November, the COP adopted the decision.\n\nSBI Conclusions: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.12), the SBI inter alia:\n\ninvites delivery partners of the GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme for the formulation of NAPs to strengthen efforts to support the LDCs with the goal of expediting the submission of readiness proposals to the GCF;\n\nnotes that all 46 LDCs have initiated the process to formulate and implement NAPs but that progress in advancing the process is slow;\n\ninvites parties and relevant organizations to support LDCs in the formulation and implementation of NAPs and in implementing elements of the LDC work programme;\n\ninitiates the review of the progress, need for continuation, and terms of reference of the LEG, and took actions and steps that resulted in the following outcomes; and\n\ncompletes its consideration of the review of the LEG.\n\nCOP Decision: In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.12/Add.1), the COP, inter alia:\n\ndecides to extend the mandate of the LEG under its current ToR;\n\ndecides that the next review of the LEG’s mandate will take place at COP 36 (2031);\n\ndecides to take stock of the LEG’s work in order to review its progress and terms of reference at COP 31 (2026), the midway point before the review at COP 36, to reflect on the evolving needs of LDCs;\n\ninvites the CMA to review the progress of the LEG as it relates to implementation of the Paris Agreement at CMA 8 (2026) as part of the stocktake;\n\ndecides to outline the steps for the stocktake at COP 29 (November 2024);\n\nrequests the LEG to continue to provide technical guidance and support to LDCs for advancing the formulation and implementation of NAPs, including in relation to the work on improving their access to funding under the GCF, to build capacity to measure adaptation outcomes, and to enhance linkages among NAPs, national, and subnational development plans and strategies, the Sustainable Development Goals, and relevant frameworks;\n\ninvites the LEG to consider under its workplan the possibility of creating thematic working groups;\n\nrequests the LEG to continue to support the LDCs in understanding the modalities for and ways of accessing relevant sources of financing, capacity building and technology transfer for adaptation in accordance with the Group’s mandate;\n\nrequests the LEG, in collaboration with relevant constituted bodies, to assist LDCs in addressing adaptation-related provisions of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, including the submission and updating of adaptation communications;\n\ndecides to adjust the composition of the Group to be as follows: five members from African LDCs, two members from Asia-Pacific LDCs; two members from SIDS LDCs, four members from LDC parties; and four members from developed country parties;\n\nrequests the LEG to develop, taking into account its current practices and its terms of reference, its draft rules of procedure, for consideration and adoption by the COP 27 and CMA 4 (November 2022); and\n\nrequests the LEG to include in its draft rules of procedure provisions on, inter alia, the nomination, term limits, and rotation of its members.\n\nReport of the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: This item was first taken up in plenary and referred to the Subsidiary Bodies as a joint item. The Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures (KCI) reported on progress towards the completion of its workplan, pointing to the publication of two technical papers.\n\nInformal consultations convened, co-facilitated by Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Andrei Marcu (Papua New Guinea). The KCI Co-Chairs presented on the KCI’s progress across its activity areas, highlighting recommendations for consideration. There were calls for regional workshops to be held within the regions and tailored to the issues relevant to the specific regions, but two countries noted that the workplan calls for a single regional workshop to be held in conjunction with the subsidiary bodies’ meeting. Views diverged on how to provide input to the Global Stocktake, with some calling for submissions and virtual intersessional work, and others recalling agreement to develop a single document during the subsidiary bodies meeting in 2022 and COP 27.\n\nIn their closing plenaries, SBI Chair Karlsen and SBSTA Chair Mpanu reported that no agreement had been reached. This item was subsequently taken up in consultations led by the COP Presidency. On Saturday, 13 November, the COP, CMP and CMA adopted a joint decision.\n\nCOP/CMP/CMA Decision: The COP, CMP, and CMA adopted a joint decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.4, FCCC/KP/CMP/2021/L.2, FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/L.6/Rev.1). In their decision, the COP, CMP, and CMA, inter alia:\n\nadopt recommendations on activity one of the workplan (explore approaches to inform the development of NDCs), and invite parties to implement them, as applicable;\n\nadopt the revised rules of procedure of the KCI contained in Annex II of the decision;\n\nrequest the forum to consider ways to minimize the adverse impacts and maximize the positive impacts of the implementation of response measures on the recommendations in Annex I;\n\nrequest the Secretariat to organize a regional workshop on activity three of the workplan (facilitate modelling and assessing the impacts of response measures) to address regional needs and acknowledge the KCI’s work; and\n\ninvite parties and observers to submit, by April 2022, their views on the elements of the midterm review of the workplan of the forum and its KCI and request the Secretariat to prepare a summary to inform discussion on the midterm review at SBSTA 56 and SBI 56.\n\nAnnex I of the decision contains recommendations on activity one of the workplan on exploring approaches to inform mitigation strategies, plans, policies, and programmes that maximize the positive and minimize the negative impacts of response measures.\n\nAnnex II of the decision contains revised rules of procedure of the KCI.\n\nGender: This item considers how to mainstream gender-responsive approaches throughout the UNFCCC’s work. It was referred to the SBI, under which informal consultation convened, co-facilitated by Sibongile Mavimbela (Eswatini) and Thomas Cameron (Canada).\n\nParties addressed two reports on gender composition of constituted bodies and party delegations (FCCC/CP/2020/3), with one featuring an analysis of speaking times during plenaries (FCCC/CP/2021/4), and a report on progress in integrating a gender perspective into constituted body processes (FCCC/CP/2021/5).\n\nDuring its closing plenary on Saturday, 6 November, the SBI recommended a draft decision for adoption by the COP, which the COP adopted on Thursday, 11 November.\n\nCOP Decision: In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2021/L.13), the COP, inter alia:\n\nrecalls the intermediate review of the progress of implementation of the activities contained in the gender action plan is due at SBI 56 (June 2022);\n\ninvites parties and observers to submit, by 31 March 2022, information on the progress of implementation of the activities contained in the gender action plan, areas for improvement and further work to be undertaken:\n\ninvites the International Labour Organization to prepare a technical paper exploring linkages between gender-responsive climate action and just transition for promoting inclusive opportunities for all in a low-emission economy, and to submit the paper to the Secretariat by 31 March 2022;\n\nrequests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report based on the submissions, information and recommendations arising from virtual and in-person workshops and events held between 1 December 2019 and 31 March 2022, and any relevant research conducted in preparation for SBI 56;\n\ntakes note of the annual reports on gender composition, which highlight the persistent lack of progress in in-person participation, the challenges identified in promoting women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in virtual forums, and the urgent need for improving the representation and leadership of women in party delegations and in all bodies established under the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement;\n\nrequests the Secretariat to explore ways of automating the analysis of data disaggregated by sex on speaking times at UNFCCC meetings;\n\nreminds parties and observers of the invitation for submissions, by 31 March 2022, on the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change, the role of women as agents of change, and opportunities for women;\n\nrequests the Secretariat to prepare an informal summary report prior to SBI 56 reflecting the proposed responsibilities of and support for national gender and climate change focal points; and\n\nencourages parties to be more explicit about the gender-responsiveness of climate finance with a view to strengthening the capacity of women and furthering work under the gender action plan in order to facilitate access to climate finance for grassroots women’s organizations as well as for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\n\nConsideration for Proposals by Parties to Amend the Convention under Article 15: This item was held in abeyance.\n\nSecond Review of the Adequacy of Articles 4a and b of the Convention: This item was held in abeyance.\n\nAdministrative, Financial and Institutional Matters: Audit report and financial statements for 2019 and 2020: Budget performance for the biennium 2018-2019 and 2020-2021: Programme budget for the biennium 2022-2023: This item and sub-items are summarized under the SBI.\n\nDecision-making in the UNFCCC process: This item was first taken up in plenary, then through Presidency-led consultations. In the closing plenary, COP 26 Vice-President Carlos Fuller (Belize) reported that parties had noted the importance of the issue, but did not agree on conclusions.\n\nGlasgow Climate Pact: During the closing plenary, the COP adopted an overarching cover decision, called the Glasgow Climate Pact. The discussions on this cover decision, and for the similar but not identical, decisions under the CMP and CMA, took place in consultations with Heads of Delegation throughout the COP.\n\nIn informal stocktaking sessions, there was considerable debate over how to reflect balance among the elements in the cover decisions, support for loss and damage, and references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nOn support for loss and damage, Guinea, for the G-77/CHINA lamented that their proposal for a loss and damage finance facility was not included in the text and queried the inclusion of the technical facility as it appeared in the draft text. The technical facility was later removed from the text. All developing countries expressed regret that loss and damage support was excluded from the text.\n\nOn the phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, the US, CHINA, INDIA, SOUTH AFRICA, and others specified a preference for specifying unabated coal and inefficient subsidies. Antigua and Barbuda for AOSIS, Bhutan for the LDCs, and others called for phasing out all coal and all fossil fuel subsidies. In the closing plenary, after an informal huddle with the US, EU, and COP 26 President Sharma, CHINA and INDIA proposed an amendment from the floor: “call upon parties to escalate the development, deployment, and dissemination of technologies and adoption of policies to transition towards low-emissions energy systems including by rapidly scaling up development of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures including escalating efforts to phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies including providing support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support to a just transition.”\n\nThe EIG, EU, MARSHALL ISLANDS, FIJI, and ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA all expressed their disappointment with the language and the non-transparent way in which it was developed and introduced. FIJI pointed out that countries were told that their text on loss and damage “proposed days ago” was too last minute, but observed that this text was inserted on the last day. But they all accepted the text “in the spirit of compromise.”\n\nThe COP then adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact, as orally amended by India’s proposal.\n\nFinal Decision: In the decision (FCCC/CP/2021/L.13), the COP, inter alia:\n\nrecognizes the role of multilateralism and the Convention, including its processes and principles, and the importance of international cooperation in addressing climate change and its impacts, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty;\n\nexpresses appreciation to the Heads of State and G"
