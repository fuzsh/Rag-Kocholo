        "text": "Background\n\nThe Education Refugee Team was set up in 2017. The team use an innovative service delivery model to improve wellbeing and learning support.\n\nOver the past eight years the council has welcomed over 200 refugees. This includes over 100 children. Potential vulnerabilities include communication barriers, social isolation and experience of trauma and loss. Many of the children have found it challenging to adapt to their new surroundings and educational settings.\n\nAttainment Scotland Funding\n\nThe ‘Stay Connected’ well-being group has recently secured £8230 from the Clackmannanshire family wellbeing partnership ‘intrapreneurship’ programme. Costs are for the ‘Stay Connected’ wellbeing groups only.\n\nWhat Clackmannanshire Council did\n\nThe Education Refugee Team is a multidisciplinary team. It includes practitioners from education, Community Learning and Development and psychological services. The team also works with a range of partners. These include housing, social services, health, police, local employers and the local college.\n\nThe Education Refugee Team offers a variety of support such as:\n\nEnglish for speakers of other languages (ESOL), provision for adult learners\n\ntargeted English as an additional language (EAL), support for school aged children\n\nwellbeing support for school pupils\n\nfamily wellbeing groups\n\neducational psychological intensive therapeutic service for trauma and loss\n\ncommunity integration events\n\nemployability support\n\nholiday programmes\n\nenhanced P7 transition\n\nstaff training in supporting refugee children\n\nNeeds-led and participatory approaches to developing support have been important to success of the team. Children, young people and their families shape the content of support activities. This ensures they receive support which is relevant and makes a meaningful difference to their lives. Regular information sessions provide translators. They have helped families to learn about the educational support available. They have also helped with employability.\n\nThe ‘Stay Connected’ wellbeing group provides opportunities for families to connect. They offer a range of events and outings. ESOL provision is tailored to individual needs. They offer classes, practical activities, one-to-one support and online sessions.\n\nA variety of activities ensures positive education outcomes for children and young people. All families are supported through a smooth enrolment process. This involves home visits, completion of documentation, liaising with schools and providing transport.\n\nRegular contact with families is maintained over the first few months. For example, specific ESOL sessions focus on school communication. This helps families to prepare for parents’ evenings. Sessions are also provided to help parents support with homework.\n\nImpact\n\nAlmost all refugee children have enrolled in school. The small number not enrolled are being home-schooled. Current attendance of refugee pupils is 93.88% for primary and 92.39% for secondary.\n\nOf the refugee school leavers in 2023, 50% progressed to university after passing the Ukrainian School Leavers Exam. The education refugee team facilitated this. Qualitative feedback from families suggests this support has been invaluable. It has helped families to integrate into Scottish society:\n\n“The Refugee Team helped my integration into Scottish society, stopped us feeling lonely, sad and depressed”.\n\n“Once again, I wanted to thank you and your team for your support during this difficult year in our lives. I remembered how I told you almost ten months ago that my dream was that my boys were safe and receiving a quality education. Now that dream has happened”.\n\n“We have good news. My son has entered university. I am so happy and so is he! Thank you for your support and help. We couldn’t have done it without your team. They have always supported us”.\n\n“I honestly can’t imagine the life of any refugee without such a strong team to help because their contribution and support can never be overestimated. They taught us to dream, to value ourselves, follow our heart and to be brave enough to take this challenge of life and go on”."
