        "text": "I have epilepsy that is controlled as long as I take my medication. This means I am allowed to drive. I just have to have my neurologist fill out a form basically giving me permission at least once a year. Since I am controlled, I usually only have maintenance appointments about once a year. I am also married and have four kids, so being able to drive is important to our daily routine. It’s also important to know that my husband has a job where we have to move every four to eight years.\n\nThis takes place a couple of years ago with our most recent move.\n\nWhen we move, one of the first things I do is find doctors and schedule appointments for everyone. After getting established with a general doctor, I get a referral to the local neurology department. To go anywhere else is like a forty-minute drive.\n\nThe day of the first appointment comes, and everything goes smoothly — no red flags. I have been in the medical rodeo here in the US for as long as I can remember, so I can usually sense a bad doctor quickly. The hospital doesn’t have the best reputation, so I was cautiously optimistic. After that appointment, I am hopeful.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nA couple of months later, I get the yearly letter from the state in the mail requesting a new driving form to be filled out by my neurologist. I call my neurologist’s office and find out about their procedure. They tell me I can drop off the form, and they will send it in. My husband offers to take it on his way to work because it’s just down the road from work and he knows I hate their parking lot. He drops it off, and we assume all is good.\n\nThey usually give you about six months to get this form in. So, about six months later, I receive a letter from the state saying the form was never received and my license is suspended. Obviously, I am wondering what the h*** happened; I did everything on my end. So, I call the doctor’s office. This is when the nightmare begins.\n\nAfter that annoying menu that all doctor offices have when you call, I finally reach a real person. I tell her the situation and ask if they sent in the form.\n\nReceptionist: “Oh, I am sorry, ma’am. [Doctor] doesn’t fill out forms. He just throws those away.”\n\nThere’s a moment of silence because I am caught off guard by that one.\n\nMe: “I called several months ago and was assured that if I dropped it off, he would fill it out and send it in.”\n\nReceptionist: “Sorry. He won’t fill that out. He literally has us throw them straight in the trash”\n\nMe: “He is required by the state to fill out this form. Does he need me to walk him through it?”\n\nAt this point, I am angry, and my listening husband offers to take over. He knows I am about to go off and thinks if he keeps calm, it can be worked out. He is also familiar with the crappy medical system and has helped people talk to doctors before. (It comes with his job.)\n\nMy husband is on the phone for over an hour and has to call a patient advocate at the hospital to get them to do anything. I am stewing nearby and growing angrier and angrier. When he hangs up, he says the doctor’s office reluctantly agreed to fill out the form and the head nurse and patient advocate will make sure it gets done.\n\nIf it ended there, I might let things go and just move on to another doctor. But no. They fill out the form wrong at least three times.\n\nThese forms are super easy and take doctors maybe thirty seconds to fill out for me. I have watched them fill it out. [Doctor] basically keeps checking a box that implies he doesn’t treat me for epilepsy and my general doctor has to do it — meaning this lazy a** is trying to get someone else to do it. The flaw in that, though, is that I grew up dealing with this crap, and I am by now very educated on how this is supposed to go.\n\nSo, I call them again. I decide to unleash my anger.\n\nReceptionist: “Neurology department, how can I help you?”\n\nMe: “I have sent over my form from the state four times now to be filled out. Once, it was thrown out. Three times, it was filled out wrong. I need [Doctor] to fill out this form today.”\n\nReceptionist: “Your general doctor is supposed to do it.”\n\nMe: “My general doctor does not treat my epilepsy. [Doctor] does. Are you stupid? The doctor treating my epilepsy has to fill it out. It’s pretty easy, actually, but if it’s too hard for the doctor, I can walk him through it. Or I can call my old neurologist, and she can teach him.”\n\nReceptionist: “It’s really not required. We don’t have to do that.”\n\nMe: “Nice try. I have been doing this for over ten years. State law requires that he fill out this form. Do I need to talk to a lawyer? “\n\nReceptionist: “Oh. Um… Yeah, just come by and it will be taken care of.”\n\nMy husband the mediator stepped in and drove to the hospital with me to get this taken care of. When we got there, he could tell that the drive just gave me more time to build more anger. He asked if he could take the form in for me.\n\nI happily handed over the form, where I had highlighted what needed to be filled out and also written step-by-step instructions on how to fill out the form. I also reminded him that if this went wrong again I would be suing, and I told him to let them know I would be reporting [Doctor] to the state medical board.\n\nHe was at first concerned that the state wouldn’t take a highlighted form, but I knew they could very easily print a new one off. He took it in, and instead of handing it to the desk, he asked for the head nurse. He waited until it was filled out and had printed proof that it had been sent in.\n\nI looked at the copy and knew that the nurse, desperately trying to resolve an unwinnable situation, had forged the doctor’s signature. No hate to the nurse; she just had a s***ty boss.\n\nAfter I got confirmation that I had my license again, I reported [Doctor] to the hospital board, filed complaints anywhere in the hospital that could hold him accountable, and made a detailed complaint to the state medical board. I also left scathing reviews online.\n\nI found a new neurologist forty minutes away, and the drive is a nice break away from the kids.\n\nShortly after I reported [Doctor] to the state medical board, I received a letter stating that they were opening an investigation into his conduct and the entire department’s conduct. They also asked me to fill out a form stating that I was okay with the investigation and so on. I filled it out and faxed it over."
