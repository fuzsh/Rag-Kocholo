However, interviewees usually dress in business-wear. A good example of this is a clean and ironed shirt with smart trousers/skirt or suit and smart shoes. This is just as important for a video interview as it is when meeting us face-to-face.\n\nWhen will I hear the outcome?\n\nWe know you'll be keen to hear the outcome of your interview, and we'll aim to update you as soon as we can after the last interview has taken place.\n\nHow do I tell you about any adjustments required in respect of a disability?\n\nWe’re proud to be a Disability Confident employer. If you encounter any accessibility challenges during your online application, please let us know by contacting Resource.Coord@edfenergy.com and one of the recruitment team will be in touch.\n\nWe operate a guaranteed interview scheme for candidates with disabilities, which means that if you meet the minimum criteria for the opportunity and you share your disability with us, you will automatically progress to the first stage of our selection process.\n\nTraining programmes\n\nI have just finished School / College and don't have any work experience - can I still apply to EDF?\n\nYes, we offer a variety of opportunities throughout the year for entry-level positions. You can find these by reviewing our early careers page.\n\nWho do I contact for queries about Graduate Programmes, Industrial Placements, Apprenticeships or Work Experience opportunities?\n\nPlease contact our Early Careers Recruitment Team here: YourFuture@edfenergy.com\n\nEmployment Scams\n\nWe're aware that a number of employment scams have targeted EDF recently and we take this very seriously.
