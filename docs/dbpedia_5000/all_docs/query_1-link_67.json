        "text": "List of Heart FM frequencies across England, Wales & Scotland\n\nThis page lists all Heart FM frequencies a UK commercial radio station which broadcasts to areas across England, Wales and Scotland. It also lists the previous name of each station, as Heart was originally comprised of just three frequencies across England, the network has since expanded and now covers much of the UK. Many areas, mainly in Southern England, lost their heritage radio brands in favour of a national commercial pop station. Although each region maintains a local drivetime show, everything else is networked. Heart is also available nationally on DAB Block 11D in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and DAB Block 12A in Scotland and the Channel Islands. Look for ‘Heart UK‘ on your radio display."
