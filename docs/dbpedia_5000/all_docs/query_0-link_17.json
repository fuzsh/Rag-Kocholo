Are people going to change stations in droves to hear someone else announcing 'Wind beneath my Wings' in on after the break? We'll see I guess. But Magic and Heart are so many people's default radio stations and have been for so long, why should they suddenly start moving down the dial to 102.2? And how many current Smooth listeners will be alienated by the change in music policy? Will they stay or go elsewhere?\n\nAs someone said on this site, Smooth is known in London as the station 'nobody listens to'. They have a huge hurdle taking on Magic, Heart and even Capital in London, never mind Radio 2...\n\n0"
