        "text": "History and structure\n\nBike for Good is a charity and social enterprise which started in July 2010 in a small stall in Glasgow’s Barras market. With a few donated bikes, a cobbled-together tool kit and a team of volunteers with a huge amount of passion and drive, Bike for Good (then known as Glasgow Bike Shed) was born!\n\nWe now have three thriving Community Hubs in Glasgow and an amazing team of 42 staff members and 50 + volunteers who are changing thousands of lives through cycling.\n\nYou can learn more about the members of our amazing team. Many of our wonderful volunteers have shared their experiences of working with Bike for Good through our online case studies.\n\nBike for Good provides access to low cost but good quality bikes whilst diverting tonnes of waste from landfill. These bikes are kindly donated by members of the public and are then refurbished and sold in our two Community Hubs. Find out more about how to donate your bike.\n\nOn average, our team of mechanics refurbish over 1000 bikes per year, diverting tonnes of waste from landfill while also providing access to affordable bikes to the public. Find out more about how to buy a refurbished bike. As well as the environmental impact of this work, the income from bike sales helps to fund our work in the community.\n\nTo keep your bike in tip-top condition, our expert mechanics offer a comprehensive bike maintenance and repair service. The aim is to keep you cycling all year round.\n\nIn addition, we offer a comprehensive programme of inclusive projects which promote, support and encourage greater levels of cycling.\n\nCycling has a multitude of benefits for society, from environmental improvements to health promotion and financial savings. We have created a series of projects and services which seek to highlight this to the public and fill a gap in current provision. Our work is structured under three impact themes:\n\nActive Travel – promotes cycling as a sustainable form of transport through the delivery of:\n\nRefurbished bike sales and bike servicing\n\nBike and e-bike loans\n\nCommunity Dr Bikes (pop up bike maintenance sessions)\n\nMaintenance classes\n\nBike Buddies programme\n\nWeekly cycle training sessions\n\nE-cargo bike loans\n\nConfidence building led rides\n\nExtensive film and speaker event programme\n\nSkills and Development – improves the life chances of young people and adults who are not engaged in full time education or employment through the delivery of:\n\nMaintenance classes\n\nCity and Guilds qualifications\n\nBuild your own bike courses\n\nFix your own bike sessions, including ones for young people\n\nGovanhill Gears Kids Club (led ride and learn to ride activities)\n\nBespoke volunteering and development programme\n\nWomen and non-binary specific maintenance programme\n\nHealth and Wellbeing – improves the mental and physical wellbeing of people with long-term health conditions through the delivery of:\n\n1:1 cycle confidence building sessions\n\nWeekly group rides\n\nSupporting partner organisations and participants to create their own cycling groups/hubs\n\nProviding an affordable transport option to those on a low income via reduced price Nextbike memberships\n\nWeekly women and non-binary specific cycle training sessions\n\nYou can find out more about these services and how to access them through the Get a Bike, Repair a Bike, Get Cycling and Develop Your Skills pages.\n\nRecently we launched a subsidiary organisation (in partnership with Vélogik) called Motion Forward which provides business to business service and fleet maintenance. A share of the income from Motion Forward will help deliver our charitable work.\n\nLearn more about Bike for Good and our history through this video:"
