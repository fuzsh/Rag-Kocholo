        "text": "Yes, the clubs were closed for 16 months, but the plus side? Independent radio is thriving. Clyde Built Radio, which launched just a month before the pandemic hit the UK last year, was one such station to boot off, via the means of home set-ups and online broadcasting.\n\nTaking its name from the compilation series by Huntleys + Palmers, the station was started by label head Andrew Thomson alongside Claudia Iona Vasiliu. They wanted to create a hub that held the Glasgow music and arts scene together under one roof; a space for interaction and growth. Frustrated with the short-sighted portrayal of the city in music circles, which concentrated on big names and major venues, the pair were determined to show what the creative scene was like on the ground.\n\nThe station is all about pushing and amplifying the voices in the city that have always been doing cool stuff there, rather than just established DJs. As such, the team hope to organise workshops and open decks sessions for those who lack the experience or equipment.\n\nRead this next: Listen to an exclusive mix by Glasgow mainstay Wheelman\n\nIn line with its community focus, the studio sits in an old stall at Barras Market— the home of local traders which has just reached its 100th year. Built last year but left empty due to the pandemic, hosts can once again broadcast live from the East End space now that restrictions have eased. Amongst the cries of pedlars and the commotion of shoppers, the sounds of Clyde Built’s residents can be heard: a mix of listeners, collectors and independent promoters based in the city, as well as visitors and passers-by.\n\nAs it heads into its second year of programming, the radio station has already established itself in the city and further afield. You’re never far from a Clyde Built tote or tee now that parties have restarted, and the team can be spotted on line-ups all across the UK."
