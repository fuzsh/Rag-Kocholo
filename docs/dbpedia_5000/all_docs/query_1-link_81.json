        "text": "Local Mod News\n\nAberdeen Local Mòd set to celebrate Gaelic culture\n\n​Scotland’s rich Gaelic heritage is set to be celebrated in Aberdeen this September. The restored 1-day event will be anchored in the heart of Aberdeen, offering locals and visitors alike the opportunity to gather to enjoy Gaelic culture and music.\n\nMarking a significant milestone in the preservation and celebration of Gaelic in the North-East, this revived local Mòd provides a platform for both junior and senior competitors to showcase their talents in various disciplines such as song, poetry, and music.\n\nLocal Mòds often serve as a stepping stone for the Royal National Mòd which takes place in a different Scottish town in October each year, with Oban welcoming back Gaeldom’s premiere musical and cultural event for 2024. Oban is fondly recognised as the home of the Mòd and will showcase its 17th edition this year.\n\nLocal Mòds have long served as the lifeblood of Gaelic culture, nurturing talents and fostering connections within communities across Scotland. With Aberdeen serving as the most recent addition to the Mòd family, An Comunn Gàidhealach and other local businesses in Aberdeen are making Gaelic culture accessible and enjoyable for all. Non-competitive musical activities will complement traditional competitions, offering a diverse array of experiences for participants and spectators alike.\n\nJames Graham, Chief Executive Officer of An Comunn Gàidhealach, said: “The addition of the Aberdeen Mòd represents an exciting step forward in our ongoing work to cultivate a thriving Gaelic community across Scotland through our Local Mòd network. It is testament to the enduring spirit of the community and their dedication to celebrate our Gaelic heritage that the Local Mòd has been reinstated in Aberdeen. This will continue to nurture and safeguard the invaluable legacy of Scotland’s Gaelic heritage for generations to come.”\n\nSecretary of Aberdeen Mòd, Finlay Morse, said: “It is a joy to be bringing a revived Local Mòd back to our city. This is not only an opportunity to celebrate our Gaelic culture but also an occasion to gather and share stories and memories from Aberdeen’s Gaelic heritage. As we embark on this exciting journey with the Aberdeen Mòd, we extend a warm invitation to all who share our passion for Gaelic culture to join us in celebrating this exciting event.”\n\nFor further details on the Aberdeen Mòd and upcoming events, please visit the Local Mòd’s Facebook page here.\n\nBack to Local Mòds News List\n\nSuccessful Glasgow Local Mòd 2024\n\n​An Comunn Gàidhealach were delighted to support the Glasgow Local Mòd which took place at Glasgow Gaelic Secondary School on Saturday 15th June 2024.\n\nWith over 200 entries for competitions in singing, poetry, storytelling, piping, battle of the bands, choirs….there was so much talent to be seen and heard.
