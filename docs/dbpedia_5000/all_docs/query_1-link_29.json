With some legendary radio names back on-air, we’re really proving what the station is all about - that age isn’t a barrier to continuing to do what you love.”\n\nDavid Lloyd added:\n\n“There is guaranteed to be at least one presenter whom each listener will relate to, with the line-up featuring names of Boomers of all ages from both commercial and BBC radio from across the UK."
