The nonprofits get to see that idea go from just something in their head to a physical product.\n\nMan:\n\nWhat, ultimately, is the problem we’re trying to solve?\n\nLuke:\n\nIt’s a really great way for us in the firm to give back.\n\nWoman 1:\n\nWe want to maximize the efficiency—\n\nWoman 2:\n\nSo we can gather even more data.\n\nMan 2:\n\nWait. Pause it.\n\nLuke:\n\nThere’s always a possibility of a complete pivot.\n\nMan 3:\n\nThere you go, that’s the problem!\n\nLuke:\n\nThey’re sleeping, whether that’s on the table or on the couch.\n\nJulia:\n\nEverything needs to be uploaded by noon.\n\nDhanashri:\n\nAnd obviously, there is a lot of coffee.\n\nAli:\n\nWe are building out solutions for these organizations with individuals that we’re actually excited to recruit into J.P. Morgan as employees.\n\nParticipants:\n\nThree... Two... One…Stop coding!\n\nDhanashri:\n\nAnd based on their pitch, we decide who the grand prize winner is, but it just doesn’t end there.\n\nMadeline:\n\nThe ideas these students come up with in twenty-four hours are then brought to life by our technologists over a period of eight months.\n\nJulia:\n\nWhen the students hear that it’s not just going to sit on the digital shelf, it’s that much more meaningful to them. They really kick started something that will be much, much larger.\n\nOn screen:\n\nDozens of JPMorgan Chase technologists raise their arms in celebration!"
