        "text": "WASHINGTON: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Axios reported, citing two US sources.\n\nOne source told Axios Trump’s call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLate last month, Netanyahu visited the US and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.\n\nEgypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.\n\nBiden laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal in an address on May 31. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.\n\nHamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.\n\nWashington, Israel’s most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nThere has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Both drew threats of retaliation against Israel.\n\nThe latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael’s subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.\n\nRIYADH: The US Green Party’s presidential nominee, who is emerging as the most favored candidate of Arab Americans, is apparently being targetted by allies of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn what looks like the start of a disqualification campaign, a member of the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint Wednesday seeking to remove Jill Stein from the ballot in Wisconsin, arguing that the party is ineligible, The Association Press reported.\n\nIt's the latest move by the DNC to block third-party candidates from the ballot, said the report, noting that Democrats are also seeking to stop independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in several states. The report was carried by various media outlets in the US.\n\nJill Stein, known for her vocal support of Palestinian rights, has emerged as the top choice among Arab American voters in the lead-up to the US elections on Nov. 5, according to a poll conducted late last month by the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).\n\nStein, a physician and environmentalist, got more than 45 percent of Arab Americans ahead of the Democratic Party presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who received 27.5 percent of the vote. Republican candidate Donald Trump polled only 2 percent, while 17.9 per cent were undecided.\n\nThe Green Party's appearance on the presidential ballot could make a difference in swing state Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between 5,700 votes and about 23,000 votes, the report said.\n\nJill Stein is expected to officially become the Green Party’s presidential nominee at its national convention, which begins Thursday. The party has yet to respond to the DNC's move.\n\nWhy Jill Stein?\n\nArab-American voters have increasingly gravitated toward Stein owing to her advocacy for Palestinian human rights and her opposition to the Israeli military’s actions in Gaza since October, ADC’s national executive director Abed Ayoub explained earlier in a post on the social platform X.\n\nThe latest survey showed a big jump from support for since ADC’s last opinion poll in May, where she led with 25 percent support. In that poll, President Joe Biden, who was still the presumptive Democratic candidate before he withdrew from the race in July, got 7 per cent of the Arab American vote. Trump polled only 2 percent.\n\nChris Habiby, the national government affairs and advocacy director for the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Stein’s support of a two-state solution and an end to Israel’s brutal military offensive in the Gaza Strip is driving her popularity among Arab- and Muslim-American voters.\n\nIsrael’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip that killed over 40,000 civilians, most of them women and children.\n\n“Dr. Jill Stein has been very clear and emphatic in her anti-genocide message,” he said on The Ray Hanania Radio Show, as reported earlier in Arab News.\n\nIn his column on Arab News, Hanania noted that while the poll numbers for Vice President Kamala Harris was much better compared to President Biden’s, her scornful response to a handful of Detroit protesters calling on her to press for a ceasefire in Gaza may not augur well for her campaign.\n\n“Her response was a major political blunder that has sparked robust debate in many swing states where Arabs and Muslims showed during the Democratic primary elections during the past six months that they can deflect thousands of votes away from Biden, all but erasing his slim margin of victory in 2020 over Trump,” wrote Hanania.\n\n“The Democrats are afraid to acknowledge the anti-Biden vote, and the likelihood that it will grow if Harris refuses to take the Arab and Muslim community seriously,” he also said.\n\nOpinion\n\nThis section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field)\n\nVeteran pollster John Zogby, president and founder of the polling company John Zogby Strategies, noted that Harris is currently leading the upward trendline mainly because she is new entering the Democratic Convention and is enjoying a short honeymoon driven by her newness as a candidate.\n\nHowever, this popularity can change, he said, noting that Arab and Muslim voters have more influence today than they have ever had since first settling in this country, and that the issue driving their vote is Gaza.\n\nIn 2022, 2.2 million people in the US reported having Arab ancestry in that year’s Arab Community Survey. The majority of Arab Americans are native-born, and 85 percent of Arabs in the US are citizens.\n\nWhile the community traces its roots to every Arab country, the majority of Arab Americans have ancestral ties to Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Iraq. The top four states by Arab American population size are California, Florida, Minnesota and Michigan.\n\nThe DNC's strange argument\n\nThe last time Stein was on the ballot in Wisconsin for the Green Party was in 2016, when she got just over 31,000 votes — more than Donald Trump's winning margin that year of just under 23,000 votes. Some Democrats blamed Stein for helping Trump win the state and the presidency.\n\nThe bipartisan elections commission in February unanimously approved ballot access for the Green Party’s presidential nominee this year because the party won more than 1% of the vote in a statewide race in 2022. Green Party candidate Sharyl McFarland got nearly 1.6% of the vote in a four-way race for secretary of state, coming in last.\n\nBut the complaint filed with the commission by David Strange, deputy operations director in Wisconsin for the DNC, alleges that the Green Party can't nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin, and without them they are forbidden from having a presidential candidate on the ballot.\n\nState law requires that those who nominate electors in October be state officers, which includes members of the Legislature, judges and others. They could also be candidates for the Legislature.\n\nThe Green Party does not have anyone who qualifies to be a nominator, and therefore can't legally name a slate of presidential electors as required by law, the complaint alleges.\n\nBecause the Green Party could have mounted write-in campaigns for legislative candidates in Tuesday's primary, but did not, the complaint could not have been brought any sooner than Wednesday, the filing alleges.\n\n“We take the nomination process for President and Vice President very seriously and believe every candidate should follow the rules,\" Adrienne Watson, senior adviser to the DNC, said in a statement. \"Because the Wisconsin Green Party hasn’t fielded candidates for legislative or statewide office and doesn’t have any current incumbent legislative or statewide office holders, it cannot nominate candidates and should not be on the ballot in November.”\n\nThis is not the first time the Green Party's ballot status has been challenged.\n\nIn 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court kept the Green Party presidential candidate off the ballot after it upheld a deadlocked Wisconsin Elections Commission, which couldn't agree on whether the candidates filed proper paperwork.\n\nThis year, in addition to the Republican, Democratic and Green parties, the Constitution and Libertarian parties also have ballot access. The commission is meeting on Aug. 27 to determine whether four independent candidates for president, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, met the requirements to appear on the ballot. The DNC member asks that the commission also consider its complaint at that meeting as well.\n\nThere are signs in some swing states, including Wisconsin, that those behind third-party candidates are trying to affect the outcome of the presidential race by using deceptive means — and in most cases in ways that would benefit Trump. Their aim is to to offer left-leaning, third-party alternatives who could siphon off a few thousand protest votes.\n\nThe latest Marquette University Law School poll conducted July 24 through Aug. 1 showed the presidential contest in Wisconsin between Democrat Kamala Harris and Trump to be about even among likely voters. Stein barely registered, with about 1% support, while Kennedy had 6%.\n\nNEW YORK: Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York university grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.\n\nThe school in upper Manhattan was roiled this year by student protests, culminating in scenes of police officers carrying zip ties and riot shields storming a building that had been occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters. Similar protests swept college campuses nationwide.\n\nIn addition to the protests, the school in July removed three deans, who have since resigned, after officials said they exchanged disparaging texts during a campus discussion about Jewish life and antisemitism. Shafik said in a July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.”\n\nShafik was also among the university leaders called for questioning before Congress earlier this year. She was heavily criticized by Republicans who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia’s campus.\n\nIn her letter announcing her resignation, Shafik heralded “progress in a number of important areas” but lamented that her tenure had also been a “period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community.” In her statement, she acknowledged the campus protests factored into her decision to resign.\n\n“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in the community,” Shafik wrote. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”\n\nShafik said she will return to the United Kingdom to lead an effort by the foreign secretary’s office reviewing the government’s approach to international development and how to improve capability.\n\n“I am very pleased and appreciative that this will afford me the opportunity to return to work on fighting global poverty and promoting sustainable development, areas of lifelong interest to me,” she wrote. “It also enables me to return to the House of Lords to reengage with the important legislative agenda put forth by the new UK government.”\n\nThe Board of Trustees announced that Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, agreed to serve as interim president. The board said Armstrong, who is also the executive vice president for the university’s Health and Biomedical Sciences, “is the right leader for this moment.”\n\nArmstrong said she was “deeply honored” to be leading the university at a “pivotal moment for Columbia.”\n\n“Challenging times present both the opportunity and the responsibility for serious leadership to emerge from every group and individual within a community,” Armstrong wrote. “This is such a time at Columbia. As I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year.”\n\nShafik was named president of the university last year and was the first woman to take on the role, and she was one of several women newly appointed to take the reins at Ivy League institutions.\n\nShe had previously led the London School of Economics and before that worked at the World Bank, where she rose through the ranks to become the bank’s youngest-ever vice president. Shafik also worked at the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, followed by stints at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England.\n\nAt the time of Shafik’s appointment, Columbia Board of Trustees chair Jonathan Lavine described her as a leader who deeply understood “the academy and the world beyond it.”\n\n“What set Minouche apart as a candidate,” Lavine had said in a statement, “is her unshakable confidence in the vital role institutions of higher education can and must play in solving the world’s most complex problems.”\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Illinois: President Joe Biden is set to sign a proclamation Friday to designate a national monument at the Springfield, Illinois, site of the 1908 race riot, which later fueled the formation of the NAACP.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday that the ceremony will be held Friday in the Oval Office and will feature civil rights leaders and community leaders from Springfield, President Abraham Lincoln’s hometown.\n\nThe ceremony comes just 5 1/2 weeks after the shooting death of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, by a white sheriff’s deputy in her Springfield home after she called 911 for help. Massey’s family members and supporters gathered Wednesday for a news conference in a continuing quest to see that justice is done in prosecuting the deputy, Sean Grayson, who is charged with first-degree murder in her death.\n\n“People are starting to take notice because it is an untold story,” Teresa Haley, former president of the Springfield NAACP, said of the riot. “It’s a deep, dark, dirty secret that Springfield is scared of.”.\n\n“It’s tragic. It’s unfortunate that it comes on the heels of Sonya Massey, but let’s say her name — Sonya Massey — and if it takes the president, the vice president and everyone else to recognize that and make this happen, it’s about time,” continued Haley, who founded of Visions 1908, a civil rights, social and economic justice and educational advocacy group\n\nThe designation by Biden doesn’t create a marker, although a memorial for the centennial stands in downtown’s Union Square Park. But Haley has been pushing a large, reflective, walk-through memorial on the site of the foundations of five of the original homes burned in the riots that were unearthed during railroad work in 2014. That project awaits funding.\n\nIn August 1908, mobs of white residents tore through Illinois’ capital city under the pretext of meting out judgment against two Black men — one jailed on a sexual assault charge involving a white woman, and the other jailed in the separate murder of a white man.\n\nAfter authorities secretly moved the prisoners from the jail and sent them to another lockup miles away, the mob took out their anger on the city’s Black population. Over the next few days, two innocent Black men were hanged, dozens of homes and businesses in Springfield’s majority-Black neighborhoods were burned to the ground, and families were forced to flee.\n\nThe National Guard was called in to restore order. White rioters were charged, but later acquitted for their roles in the lynching and destruction.\n\nAt least eight white people were killed in the violence and more than 100 were injured, mostly by members of the state’s militia or each other, according to news articles from that period. It’s not known how many Black people were injured and killed.\n\nFed-up civil rights leaders met in New York and chose the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, Feb. 12, 1909, to form the NAACP, whose original board included scholar W.E.B. DuBois.\n\nSontae Massey, who was very close to his cousin Sonya Massey, said the family is descended from William Donegan, an 84-year-old cobbler, married to a white woman, who was lynched the first night of the riot. Now, the current generation is dealing with the tragic loss of another family member.\n\n“It’s ironic that we are now at the very foundation of what this family has stood for for hundreds of years. We will continue to make change across America. This is just the beginning,” Massey said. “It’s appropriate. We have been the catalysts of change since 1908. We’re continuing the tradition.”\n\nThe Springfield attack came more than a decade before at least 25 documented attacks by white people against Black people during the summer of 1919, later called “Red Summer ” for the bloodshed.\n\nTwo years later, a white mob looted and burned Tulsa’s Greenwood district, killing as many as 300 Black residents. Biden traveled to Tulsa in 2021 to mark the 100th anniversary of the massacre.\n\nJean-Pierre called the Springfield riot a “horrific attack by a white mob on a Black community” and said that civil rights leaders have worked to highlight what occurred “to spark national action on civil rights.” She promised that the White House would provide further details ahead of the official announcement on Friday.\n\nIn 2020, the site of the riot near downtown Springfield was added to the National Park Service’s African American Civil Rights Network, a collection of places and programs that outline the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Federal grants are available for the sites.\n\n“While the 1908 Springfield race riot demonstrates our nation’s deep history of racial violence, it also sparked the creation of the NAACP — reflecting the strength and resilience of Black Americans in the tireless fight for civil rights,” said US Rep. Nikki Budzinski, whose office said she urged Biden to designate the monument. “Today’s announcement is a critical step forward to honor those who were killed in the 1908 attack and acknowledge the impact this tragedy had.”\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany: A German military base was sealed off for several hours Wednesday as authorities investigated suspected sabotage while a NATO air base in the country faced an attempted trespassing incident, officials said.\n\nThe Bundeswehr base in Cologne-Wahn was locked down because of “a suspicion of an attempted intrusion and a suspicion of sabotage,” defense ministry spokesman Col. Arne Collatz told reporters in Berlin.\n\nA hole was discovered in a fence near drinking water storage facilities, the military’s territorial command said on X.\n\nThe perpetrators had not been found and the site’s water was being checked as a precaution. The base re-opened later in the day, it added.\n\nDer Spiegel magazine reported that soldiers and civilians on the Bundeswehr base had been advised not to drink the tap water over concerns that the water supply “may be contaminated.”\n\nThe Cologne-Wahn base, located near Cologne-Bonn airport, houses several military and civilian facilities of the German armed forces as well as aircraft used by Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his ministers for government travel.\n\nThe base is also an important hub for military support for Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers regularly fly home from there, via Poland, after receiving training in Germany, Der Spiegel added.\n\nA NATO base in the western German town of Geilenkirchen meanwhile faced an attempted trespassing incident late Tuesday, the military alliance said in a statement.\n\nAn individual attempted to enter the base but was stopped and sent away, a spokesman said, adding that a “routine” sweep of the site and people there was conducted afterwards. Police are investigating the incident.\n\nFollowing the lockdown at the Cologne-Wahn base, the NATO site also increased its security level and conducted routine checks of its water supply but added it had no concerns with the safety of its supply.\n\nThe base, home to NATO AWACS reconnaissance aircraft, was not sealed off and continued operating at full capacity, the spokesman said.\n\nDefense Minister Boris Pistorius told Der Spiegel that the authorities “reacted quickly” at both sites by sealing off access, alerting investigators and ordering laboratory analyzes to check for possible contamination.\n\n“These incidents show we must remain vigilant,” he added.\n\nMarcus Faber, a German lawmaker from the liberal FDP party and chairman of parliament’s defense committee, told Bild daily that with the two incidents coming so close together “one can assume that an enemy actor wants to demonstrate his sabotage skills.”\n\nGermany — a key ally of Kyiv — has been on high alert for sabotage and attacks on military facilities in the country in the wake of Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn April, investigators arrested two German-Russian men on suspicion of spying for Russia and planning attacks in Germany — including on US army facilities — to undermine military support for Ukraine."
