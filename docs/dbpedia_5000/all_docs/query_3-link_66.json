Interstitial cells of mesenchymal origin interact with and form electrical connectivity with smooth muscle cells in many organs, and these cells provide important regulatory functions. For example, in the gastrointestinal tract, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and PDGFRα+ cells have been described, in detail, and represent distinct classes of cells with unique ultrastructure, molecular phenotypes, and functions. Smooth muscle cells are electrically coupled to ICC and PDGFRα+ cells, forming an integrated unit called the SIP syncytium. SIP cells express a variety of receptors and ion channels, and conductance changes in any type of SIP cell affect the excitability and responses of the syncytium. SIP cells are known to provide pacemaker activity, propagation pathways for slow waves, transduction of inputs from motor neurons, and mechanosensitivity. Loss of interstitial cells has been associated with motor disorders of the gut. Interstitial cells are also found in a variety of other smooth muscles; however, in most cases, the physiological and pathophysiological roles for these cells have not been clearly defined. This review describes structural, functional, and molecular features of interstitial cells and discusses their contributions in determining the behaviors of smooth muscle tissues.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\n“Interstitial cells” is a morphological term denoting a variety of cells of differing origins and phenotypes occupying spaces within the interstitium between the cells most prominent in defining a given tissue. In smooth muscle tissues fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, and interstitial cells of Cajal meet this definition. While mainly considered structural or immune cells by many morphologists, interstitial cells have come into prominence because they drive or contribute to the normal functions of smooth muscle organs, and remodeling or loss of these cells can lead to a variety of motor disorders. This review describes the physiology of the fibroblast-like classes of interstitial cells, which can include interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), ICC-like cells, “Cajal-like” cells, fibroblast-like cells and teleocytes in various anatomical descriptions of smooth muscle tissues (138, 213, 231, 292, 297, 322, 326, 342, 369, 389). There is a continuum of morphology in this group of cells, with some cells having abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), no basal lamina, no caveolae, and assuming a morphology attributed typically to fibroblasts. Other cells assume a more muscle-like appearance with less rough ER, but abundant smooth ER, prominent or even complete basal laminae, and caveolae (318, 376). Interstitial cells can form gap junctions with each other and with neighboring smooth muscle cells and can generate and conduct electrical signals that regulate smooth muscle excitability. Interstitial cells serve as pacemaker cells, propagation pathways for regenerative electrical events that cannot be propagated actively by smooth muscle cells, transducers of inputs from motor neurons, and stretch receptors. For historical reviews of the morphology and functions of interstitial cells, the reader is referred to a monograph by Lars Thuneberg (369) that reviews more than 200 morphological studies of muscle-like or fibroblast-like interstitial cells and a previous physiological review of electrical rhythmicity in visceral smooth muscles and role of ICC as pacemakers (326).\n\nWork on interstitial cells in gastrointestinal (GI) muscles has dominated this field of investigation because there were important experimental opportunities that could be exploited. Interstitial cells in the tunica muscularis of GI muscles have distinct morphological features (98, 213, 369), mice with mutations in the protooncogene Kit have reduced populations of ICC in specific regions of the GI tract, and Kit mutants develop striking functional phenotypes (45, 167, 250, 378, 404, 417). Immunolabeling with antibodies against c-Kit has become a standard means for identification of “Cajal-like” cells (404) in a variety of organs. However, many studies of tissues outside the gut have encountered difficulties in labeling a distinct class of interstitial cells (other than mast cells) with this technique, and Kit mutants neither lacked the cells suspected to be interstitial cells nor displayed functional defects. Thus progress in understanding the functions of interstitial cells in non-GI muscles has been slower. The discussion in this review will begin by reviewing highlights of research on ICC in the GI tract and then focus on progress made on this class of cells in other smooth muscle organs. Recent progress on a second class of interstitial cells, known for decades in the morphological literature as “fibroblast-like cells,” will also be discussed. These cells are labeled specifically in several smooth muscles by antibodies against platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) (174, 207), and this has provided an important means of accessing these cells in physiological and genomic investigations.\n\nII. ICC IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\n\nA. Structural Features of ICC and PDGFRα+ Cells and Networks\n\nAn important feature of GI interstitial cells (ICC and PDGFRα+ cells; see and for clarification of the terminologies used to describe these cells and their specific anatomical localizations) is electrical coupling to smooth muscle cells. ICC and smooth muscle cells express a variety of gap junction proteins (68, 136, 337), but little is known about the nature and regulation of the gap junctions between interstitial cells and smooth muscle cells. Gap junctions facilitate communication between interstitial cells and smooth muscle cells ( ). Electrical connectivity between interstitial cells and smooth muscle cells in GI muscles causes the tunica muscularis to behave, in fact, as a multicellular electrical syncytium. We have referred to this functional structure as the smooth muscle cell/ICC/PDGFRα+ cell (SIP) syncytium (209, 330; see ). Changes in electrical conductances in one type of SIP cell affect the electrical excitability of the other coupled cells. Spontaneous pacemaker activity generated by ICC conducts to smooth muscle cells and drives electrical slow waves and phasic contractions, and neural inputs to ICC and PDGFRα+ cells can conduct to smooth muscle cells and modulate contractile behavior. The integrated behavior of SIP cells defines what has been referred to classically as “myogenic” regulation of GI motor function. However, with current knowledge, the term myogenic is too limited to define a major division of GI regulation, and we suggest replacement of this term with SIPgenic to refer to the complex and integrated regulatory processes operating beneath the level of neural and hormonal regulation. It is now recognized that remodeling or loss of any component of the SIP syncytium or loss of connectivity between SIP cells can lead to abnormal motor behaviors in GI organs.\n\nTable 1.\n\nOrganSubregionICC-MYICC-IMICC-SEPICC-SMICC-SSPDGFRα+-MYPDGFRα+-IMReference Nos.EsophagusSkeletal muscle—±—????316Smooth muscle—++?????73Lower esophageal sphincter—++?—???408, 432StomachFundus—CM ++±*——++++35, 36, 45LM ++Corpus+++CM ++±*——++++44LM ±*Antrum+++CM ++±*+—++++35, 36, 44, 82, 174, 265, 279, 305LM ±*Pylorus+++CM ++±*+—??234, 392, 396, 408LM ++Small intestineDuodenum+++DMP ++±*——??19, 298CM ±*LM ±Jejunum+++DMP ++±*——++++36, 167, 174, 317, 376, 378, 387, 404CM ±*LM ±Ileum+++DMP ++±*——++++44, 100, 113CM ±*LM ±Ileo-cecal sphincter++CM ++?+—??266LM +ColonProximal+++CM ++±*+++++++29, 36, 44, 99, 174, 182, 220, 243, 319, 323, 343, 375, 387LM ++Distal++CM +±*+++++++220LM +Internal anal sphincter—++++*?+++++61, 62\n\nWhile the activity of the SIP syncytium is highly integrated in GI organs, knowledge about the functions of SIP cells has benefitted from studies of specific cell types. Electrical coupling makes it very difficult to deduce the specific functions of one component in intact tissues. Even with mutant animals lacking specific elements of the SIP syncytium, it is still difficult to ascertain the specific functions of each cellular component. Dispersion of the tunica muscularis with proteolytic enzymes yields a mixture of cells. Smooth muscle cells are abundant and relatively easy to identify by their shapes, but interstitial cells are more rare and difficult to identify with certainty (typically amounting to <10% of cells within a given volume of muscle) and display morphologies that overlap with other cells in the dispersion. Cultures derived from explants or cells dispersed from smooth muscle tissues contain a variety of cells, and if the cells contact each other, gap junctions can form. As in tissues, it again becomes problematic to maintain voltage control in voltage-clamp studies or to know which cell has generated a particular response. Another serious problem is that ionic conductances that define the functions of SIP syncytium cells are lost in cell cultures (436). Therefore, it is difficult to see the value of cell cultures for studies of the native behaviors of SIP cells.\n\nGenetically engineered mice with cell-specific expression of fluorescent reporters have become important tools for studies of SIP cells (221, 311, 419, 436). SIP cells from reporter strains of animals can be identified unequivocally for electrophysiological and imaging studies, and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) cells can be used to collect purified populations of cells for comprehensive sequencing of transcriptomes. Expression of inducible Cre recombinase in specific SIP cells has been accomplished and provides a powerful new technique for future studies of interstitial cells (131, 200).\n\nAnother suggestive anatomical feature of interstitial cells is their close associations with nerve varicosities, identified originally by electron microscopy (160, 318, 397). In the case of ICC, this relationship was noted by Santiago Ramón y Cajal (47), and he suggested that ICC were a type of peripheral neuron that connects motor neurons to local effector cells, such as smooth muscle cells. We know now that ICC are not neurons and of mesodermal origin (238, 379, 409, 430). Close associations between neurons and ICC were subjects of note in many classical electron microscopic examinations of these cells (73, 98, 179, 318). PDGFRα+ cells are also closely associated with terminals of neurons (36, 221, 434); however, the very close areas of apposition (<20 nm) between nerve varicosities and ICC described in many species have not been described for PDGFRα+ cells. Close associations between intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM) are relatively easy to identify in transmission electron micrographs in experimental animals and human GI muscles and have been described as “synapselike.” Close contacts might indicate innervation of ICC by motor neurons. If neurotransmitters are released into regions of close association, very high concentrations might be achieved in the tiny postjunctional volumes, and transduction of neural inputs may tend to be focused at the sites of close contact. High junctional concentrations might also increase the rates of metabolism and/or reuptake of neurotransmitters and metabolites.\n\nClose connections have also been described between nerve varicosities and smooth muscle cells (73, 264, 397), but these junctions appear either to be more rare or, at least, have been deemphasized or gone unmentioned in many morphological reports. The physical proximity of motor neurons to interstitial cells led to much speculation about the role of these cells in transducing neural inputs; however, functional innervation is much more controversial and difficult to demonstrate (see sect. IIF).\n\nICC have an abundance of mitochondria, moderately well-developed Golgi, caveolae, and rough and smooth ER. The perinuclear region is often densely packed with mitochondria and cisternae of ER running along the plasma membrane. The spaces between ER and the plasma membrane create tiny volumes in which localized Ca2+ transients may regulate plasma membrane ion channels and other functions of interstitial cells, such as pacemaker activity and responses to neurotransmitters. ICC have caveolae and a basal lamina in many regions of the gut, but these features are typically lacking in PDGFRα+ cells. Microtubules and thin and intermediate filaments are observed in ICC, but myosin thick filaments are not often found (320). Another difference between ICC and PDGFRα+ cells is that the latter are typically less electron dense than ICC within the same thin sections. A great abundance of rough ER is commonly found in PDGFRα+ cells compared with ICC, and this feature was considered “fibroblast-like” by electron microscopists. As mentioned previously, gap junctions are formed between ICC and PDGFRα+ cells and smooth muscle cells (158, 159). While PDGFRα+ cells tend to display similar ultrastructure features in various organs and in different species, ICC display a variety of structural and ultrastructural characteristics between species and organs, particularly in the abundance of caveolae and completeness and prominence of their basal laminae (211). However, there are not clear differences in ultrastructure that can be extrapolated to all regions. Some investigators have described ICC as specialized smooth muscle cells (88, 98, 179, 376). For example, ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine express λ enteric actin, an actin isoform associated with GI smooth muscle cells (334), smooth muscle myosin light chains, and sparse distribution of thick filaments (376). In other studies, ICC are described as more fibroblast-like (66, 113, 212, 309, 314). Cells more like smooth muscle have more complete basal laminae and prominent caveolae; these features are more sparse or lacking in cells with a fibroblast-like appearance.\n\nMost studies of ICC have been performed on mammalian species and limited primarily to common laboratory animals and humans. Recent, morphological reports describe ICC in the GI tract of zebrafish (14). The morphological features of these cells are similar in description to their mammalian counterpart; however, caveolae were not observed in either ICC or smooth muscle cells. ICC in zebrafish can also be identified by antibodies for c-Kit.\n\nUltrastructural characteristics are useful for identification of ICC and PDGFRα+ cells, but the technical demands of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) make this technique suboptimal for efficient characterizations of interstitial cell distributions and clinical assessments of the state of interstitial cells in human muscles (where frequently adequate fixation to preserve identifying features is difficult to achieve).\n\n1. Histological and immunomarkers for ICC\n\nFor many years interstitial cells were difficult to investigate because these cells represent only a fraction of the total cells in the tunica muscularis, and there were no specific labels for these cells. Several histological stains were used to highlight ICC, such as methylene blue (366, 369), Champy-Maillet zinc iodide-osmic acid (59, 206, 321), Golgi (silver impregnation) staining (47, 206), rhodamine 123 (402), and NADH diaphorase (95, 420). None of these techniques was highly specific for interstitial cells, and successful staining was accomplished in only some regions of the gut and in only certain species (315). These limitations led one author to summarize various histological methods for identifying interstitial cells as “capricious” (58). For many years, the most reliable method for identification of interstitial cells was TEM, and a major obstacle in morphological studies was the inability to confirm that cells stained by histological techniques and imagined with light microscopy were the same cells identified by ultrastructural criteria with TEM. The ability to image cells with light and electron microscopy was an advantage of the NADH diaphorase technique (420). A study of the dog small intestine explored the nature and abundance of intermediate filaments in ICC within the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) and discovered that vimentin filaments were predominant (376). Vimentin became the first immunolabel for interstitial cells and was used widely in many organs to identify populations of these cells. However, vimentin may not distinguish between c-Kit+ (ICC) and PDGFRα+ cells.\n\nInvestigators studying hematopoietic cells and developmental defects in melanocyte and germ cells in Kit (White spotting; W) mutants (49, 118) observed that cells in a variety of tissues express Kit. To study the functions of c-Kit more broadly, neutralizing antibodies (ACK2) were administered to neonatal mice (250). These studies found that a population of cells within the small intestine expressed c-Kit-like immunoreactivity, and neutralizing c-Kit antibody injections produced severe defects in intestinal motility described as paralytic ileus. Closer inspection showed that ileal muscles lacked normal phasic contractile activity, but instead displayed clusters of arrhythmic contractions. Responses to agonists (bradykinin and acetylcholine) were also altered. Abnormal contractile patterns were also observed in ileal muscles of W/WV mice. Major morphological defects were not apparent in enteric nerves or smooth muscle cells of ACK2-treated mice. Immunolabeling demonstrated c-Kit+ cells in the region surrounding the myenteric plexus and within the circular muscle layer. Loss of mechanical rhythmicity and reduction in c-Kit+ cells after treatment with neutralizing antibodies suggested that the cells expressing c-Kit might be ICC. However, technical difficulties, including the inability to utilize the antibodies for immunocytochemistry or to identify the immunolabeled cells as ICC with other histological techniques, made it impossible for these authors to identify the c-Kit+ cells as ICC definitively (250).\n\nPositive identification of c-Kit+ cells in the GI tract was eventually revealed by colabeling cells with methylene blue and by immunocytochemistry (378). Examples of ICC from mouse, monkey, and human gastric antral muscles, labeled with antibodies to c-Kit, are shown in . Treatment of newborn mice with neutralizing c-Kit antibodies reduced or abolished the number of c-Kit immunopositive cells, the number of cells labeled with methylene blue, and cells with ultrastructural features of ICC (378). Additional studies showed that the cells in the region of the myenteric plexus (i.e., in the space between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers) that labeled with c-Kit antibodies (ICC-MY) were reduced in intestinal muscles of W/WV mice (167, 404). Mast cells are also labeled with c-Kit antibodies. However, few mast cells are present in the tunica muscularis of mice kept in clean animal facilities. Labeling with c-Kit antibodies became the standard technique for study and identification of ICC, and this technique has been widely exploited in developmental studies, pathological evaluations, and molecular and physiological studies during the past two decades. Much progress in our knowledge of ICC has occurred due to studies made possible by the use of c-Kit antibodies. c-Kit labeling was also adopted for diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) after GISTs were found to express c-Kit and may develop from ICC due to gain-of-function mutations (discussed further in sect. IIJ) (149).\n\nProgress on ICC has depended on development or novel application of technology and reagents ( ). When c-Kit antibodies directed at extracellular epitopes were found to label ICC, we tried immunolabeling of live cells after enzymatic dispersion. However, the proteolytic enzymes used to disperse cells appear to damage the extracellular epitopes. Thus it became desirable to develop reporter strains with constitutive expression of fluorescent reporters. Unfortunately, the cell-specific promoters that drive expression of Kit in ICC are unknown, so it was not possible to generate a reporter strain with a simple knock-in strategy. The first strain developed utilized endogenous Kit promoters with a novel green fluorescent protein, ZsGreen, knocked into the first exon of the Kit gene, creating a null Kit allele, W(ZsGreen)(418). Heterozygous [W(ZsGreen)/+] had tiny fluorescent dots in Kit expressing cells. This was an exciting advance, but the expression of ZsGreen was low in most ICC. Pacemaker ICC expressed only a few green dots per cell. Another approach utilized a similar strategy to exploit the endogenous cell-specific promoter and express a bright green fluorescent protein (copGFP) as the knock-in reporter (311, 436). Cells of Kit(copGFP/+) mice were highly fluorescent and visible in intact muscles and in cell dispersions. It should be noted that cells can even be visualized readily in living Kit(copGFP/+) mice using a fluorescence micro-endoscope inserted into the abdomen (unpublished observations). The reporter strain and cells dispersed from the tunica muscularis have been used in many subsequent physiological and molecular studies (discussed in sections below) and offered, for the first time, an efficient means of isolating and purifying living ICC.\n\nTable 2.\n\nYear(s)Major Investigation and AdvancesKey Reference Nos.Before 1985Morphological studies of ICC; controversies with staining techniques; EM considered the “gold standard” for identifying ICC.47, 98, 113, 179, 309, 314, 369, 434, 4351980–1994Whole muscle experiments; dissection to remove areas rich in specific ICC populations; use of “selective” poisons to destroy ICC function.17, 29, 90, 137, 247, 354, 355, 370, 4021989Isolation of fresh ICC and identification of cells by morphological features; demonstration of intrinsic electrical rhythmicity in isolated ICC.2351992–presentUse of c-Kit mutants and c-Kit neutralization to study physiological functions of ICC.45, 167, 250, 377, 378, 400, 403, 4041994–presentRecognition of Kit immunohistochemistry as specific means to identify and characterize ICC networks.44, 45, 167, 378, 4041994–presentDemonstration of the role of ICC in electrical rhythmicity.44, 45, 82, 125, 167, 279, 378, 4041996–presentDemonstration of the role of ICC in motor neurotransmission.22, 24, 45, 178, 324, 400, 4081996–presentAssociation of ICC loss or growth with pathophysiological conditions.205, 249, 252, 279, 2821998Discovery that c-Kit is a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); GIST may arise from gain-of-function mutation in c-Kit of ICC.78, 145, 149, 151, 2691998–2009Culturing of ICC for more detailed physiological studies.208, 368, 4102004–presentUse of flow cytometry to quantify and FACS to purify immunolabeled ICC.52, 53, 161, 276, 2772004–presentFollowing activation of interstitial cells and propagation of pacemaker activity with digital imaging of Ca2+ transients.146, 241–243, 283, 4232005Demonstration of the role of ICC as stretch receptors.214, 4172008Isolation of progenitor cells capable of generating ICC.16, 2482009Reporter strains of mice in which freshly dispersed interstitial cells can be isolated and positively identified in mixed populations of cells.221, 311, 418, 4362007–2009Recognition of the importance of Ano1 (encoded by Tmem16a) in ICC and its role in pacemaking.52, 122, 172, 4362009Identification of PDGFRα as a specific marker for fibroblast-like cells.174, 1772011Isolation of PDGFRα+ cells using a reporter strain and physiological studies suggesting their role in inhibitory neurotransmission.2212013Cell-specific iCRE strains that allow inducible knockdowns of genes/proteins in interstitial cells.131, 200\n\nDespite the progress made with c-Kit immunohistochemistry, the search for molecular reagents to identify and manipulate ICC populations goes on. A striking advance occurred when antibodies developed from GIST tumors (discovered on GIST-1; DOG-1) were found to label GIST tumor cells and ICC (93, 415). It was later discovered that DOG-1 corresponded to the gene product of ANO1 (aka TMEM16a). A gene array screen of transcripts expressed by small intestinal ICC showed Ano1 to be one of the most highly expressed genes in ICC (52), and the gene product of Ano1, a chloride channel known as ANO1, is expressed robustly and exclusively by ICC throughout the GI tract (35, 122, 172). An advantage of labeling ICC in GI muscles with ANO1 antibodies is that mast cells are not labeled, and therefore, this method may be superior to c-Kit labeling in conditions in which mast cells infiltrate the muscle layers or, as in human GI muscles, where they are often abundant.\n\n2. Histological and immunomarkers for PDGFRα+ cells\n\nPDGFRα+ cells were referred to as fibroblasts or “fibroblast-like cells” (FLC) by morphologists (213). While TEM provided a description of the ultrastructural features of FLC and close appositions made by these cells to other cellular constituents of the muscularis, it was difficult to get a full appreciation of the extent and distribution of these cells throughout the GI tract, the major anatomical niches they occupy, and the relationships of these cells to other cells from the limited number of images in the published literature. Histological techniques were unable to identify FLC specifically, and few studies considered a role for these cells in regulating the behavior of the smooth muscle tissues.\n\nTwo immunomarkers were initially found to label FLC. The discovery that many GIST express c-Kit (149) was accompanied by reports that GIST cells and ICC also express CD34 (312). Others reported that CD34+ cells were adjacent to ICC, but represented a distinct population of cells (289, 387, 388). Cells with CD34-like immunoreactivity in the human small GI tract were identified as c-Kit− FLC. Thus CD34 became a first immunolabel for FLC, but it was also recognized that CD34 is not a specific label in the gut wall, and other mesenchymal cell types express this antigen (289, 387). The guinea pig GI tract was found to express small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK2 and SK3), and SK3+ cells were found to be c-Kit− cells in the myenteric region and within the circular muscle layers of GI muscles (202). Two additional studies reported labeling of c-Kit− cells with antibodies to SK3 in human and mouse GI muscles (108, 386). SK2 expression was dominant in smooth muscle cells, but transcripts of SK3 were also found in these cells (310). These data are consistent with immunohistochemical findings showing punctate SK3 immunoreactivity in smooth muscle cells (202). Thus labeling with antibodies to SK3 is also nonspecific under some circumstances.\n\nSignificant progress occurred when FLC throughout the GI tracts of adult animals were found to express PDGFRα (174, 177). PDGFRα+ cells were shown to be FLC by immunocytochemistry and robust expression of SK3. PDGFRα+ cells are distinct from c-Kit+ ICC and unaffected in Kit mutants in which ICC are greatly reduced ( ). PDGFRα+ cells form networks adjacent to ICC in the region of the myenteric plexus and are intertwined with ICC and processes of enteric neurons in muscle layers (174, 221). Similar distributions of PDGFRα+ cells and inter-relationships with ICC and enteric motor neurons have been observed in several mammalian species including humans (35, 36, 50, 220, 221). Thus PDGFRα antibodies have become a reliable marker for FLC, and most investigators have adopted the terminology of PDGFRα+ cells to refer to these cells. As more is learned about the phenotype (chemical coding) of this class of interstitial cells, more specific terminology may become advantageous, because PDGFRα is expressed by many cells in the body and at various stages of development. At the present time, specific markers to distinguish cells within the region of the myenteric plexus (PDGFRα+-MY; ) or within the muscle bundles of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers (PDGFRα+-IM; ) have not been identified. Developing specific labels for subclasses of PDGFRα+ cells will allow finer resolution of their phenotypes and functions in the future.\n\nIn addition to the obvious advantages of a robust and selective immunolabel for morphological studies and pathological evaluations of PDGFRα+ cells, a mouse engineered to express a histone 2B-eGFP fusion protein driven off the endogenous promoter for PDGFRα (135) was found to have bright eGFP fluorescence in nuclei of cells immuoreactive for PDGFRα antibodies (221). Cells with eGFP recapitulated the distribution of PDGFRα+ cells in the gut with high fidelity. Constitutive labeling of PDGFRα+ cells opened the door to molecular phenotyping and physiological studies of these cells (as discussed below).\n\nB. Notes on Nomenclature for Interstitial Cells\n\nInterstitial cell nomenclature has been somewhat of a battleground for many years, and it is not yet resolved. Thus it is important to provide some background on this topic and a key for readers to understand the varied terminologies found in the literature to describe these cells. Cajal described cells within villi, in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine, and in the region of the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's plexus in the terminology of the day) that had fusiform cell bodies and long, thin and branching, axonlike processes. The latter may have been the visual cue to Cajal suggesting that ICC were a class of primitive neuron. When Cajal's staining techniques were repeated in more recent studies, it appears that neither glial cells nor fibroblast-like cells (including ICC) displayed this exact morphology. It has been suggested that the cells Cajal described may have been a chimeric structure consisting of glial cells or interstitial cells and contiguous nerve fibers (206). In spite of a possible disparity between the structures described by Cajal and the cells now identified as ICC, widespread usage of this term in the literature makes altering this terminology counterproductive.\n\nElectron microscopy and histochemical techniques made it clear that ICC occupied several distinctive niches in the GI tract. Immunolabeling with c-Kit antibodies (e.g., Refs. 35, 44, 183, 377, 378) and ANO1 antibodies (35, 122, 172) clarified the distribution of ICC in specific locations and showed that ICC occupy most of the same locations in all mammals, including humans. Together with functional studies (described below), certain populations of ICC, distributed within specific planes in the tunica muscularis, can be grouped and thus linked by more specific terminology. We have called ICC within the region between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, ICC-MY, while others refer to these cells as ICC-AP (while Auerbach's plexus was still in common usage) or ICC-MP (since myenteric plexus has come into preferential usage). We favor the term ICC-MY because these cells are not a component of the myenteric plexus (as the terms ICC-AP or ICC-MP might imply). ICC-MY lie between the muscle layers of the myenteron and surround myenteric ganglia, but they are not intrinsic to ganglia or the tertiary plexus. Therefore, a label implying that they are part of the myenteric plexus is morphologically incorrect. Cells within muscle bundles have been referred to as intramuscular ICC or ICC-IM. Some authors have used specific terms for ICC-IM within the circular muscle (ICC-CM) or longitudinal muscle (ICC-LM); however, no distinctive morphological or functional data exist to suggest differences between these ICC. A specialization of ICC-IM is found in the small intestine in which ICC are densely distributed and intimately associated with neurons of the deep muscular plexus, and therefore these cells are referred to as ICC-DMP. Cells at the inner aspect of the circular muscle layer in the colon and more sparsely in this location in the stomach are in contact with the submucosa and therefore called ICC-SM. Cells along the submucosal surface of the circular muscle layer are sometimes referred to as ICC-SMP, but these cells are distinct and well removed from the submucous plexus, so this designation is misleading. Cells within the septa that separate muscle bundles are referred to as ICC-SEP. provides localizations of the different classes of ICC throughout the GI tract and attempts to also summarize the alternative terminologies that have been used in the literature.\n\nWhen it became possible to immunolabel fibroblast-like cells with PDGFRα antibodies (174), it was recognized that this population of interstitial cells occupies most of the same anatomical niches as ICC, and therefore, similar terminology was proposed to designate these cells: 1) PDGFRα+ cells were utilized because identification by chemical coding is more specific than the vague term “fibroblast-like” cells, 2) PDGFRα+-IM was applied to cells within muscle bundles, and 3) PDGFRα+-MY was applied to cells in the plane of the myenteric plexus between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers ( ; ).\n\nC. Role of Interstitial Cells in Pacemaking and Generation of Electrical Rhythmicity\n\nIn many, but not all, regions of the GI tract, motor patterns are intrinsically phasic in nature. Spontaneous pacemaker activity (termed, slow waves; ) drives and times the phasic contractile behavior. Slow waves occur in continuous rhythmic depolarization/repolarization cycles, and different regions of the bowel display distinct intrinsic slow wave frequencies ( ). Slow waves also vary in duration from one to several seconds. Interslow wave transmembrane potentials (typically referred to as resting membrane potential or RMP) of GI smooth muscle cells range between −80 and −40 mV and are generally somewhat negative to the range of potentials required for substantive activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus smooth muscle cells in the SIP syncytium do not generate Ca2+ action potentials at the relatively negative potentials (RMP) between slow waves.\n\nActivation of Ca2+ channels provides the switch for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in the tunica muscularis. Slow waves are oscillations in membrane potential from base to peak of 10–60 mV. Muscles with quite negative resting membrane potentials display larger amplitude slow waves, but these events never overshoot 0 mV. When slow waves are recorded from smooth muscle cells, they rise from RMP at a peak velocity of ∼1 V/s during the upstroke depolarization and then dwell in a “plateau” phase for variable durations. At completion of the plateau phase, the cells repolarize to RMP.\n\nThe primary purpose of slow waves is to depolarize smooth muscle cells sufficiently to activate Ca2+ influx. Like vascular muscles, smooth muscle cells of the GI tract express voltage-dependent (L-type) Ca2+ channels (86, 191, 236, 263). During slow wave depolarizations, the open probability of smooth muscle Ca2+ channels increases and sufficient Ca2+ entry occurs to trigger excitation-contraction coupling (281, 391). The rhythmic pattern of slow waves naturally organizes the contractile activity of GI muscles into phasic contractions. In the corpus and antrum of the stomach, slow wave depolarization alone initiates peristaltic contractions, and modulation of slow wave amplitude and duration regulates the force of contractions. Depolarization for several seconds during the plateau phase of slow waves is sufficient for enough Ca2+ entry to initiate contractions. In the pyloric sphincter, small bowel, and colon, slow waves bring membrane potentials of smooth muscle cells to a threshold for Ca2+ action potentials, and transmembrane potential recordings from muscles of these organs typically show one or more Ca2+ action potentials superimposed upon the peaks of slow waves (92). In these regions Ca2+ action potentials are the smooth muscle cell response to slow wave depolarizations.\n\nThe source and mechanism of slow waves in the GI tract have been under investigation for decades. Slow waves were considered to be nonneurogenic and referred to in the literature typically as “myogenic” in origin because blocking nerve action potentials with tetrodotoxin did not abolish slow wave activity. For many years it was assumed that smooth muscle cells generated the spontaneous slow wave activity. The literature before the mid 1980s contained many studies designed to investigate the mechanism of slow waves. Some of the more detailed experiments came from the laboratories of C. Ladd Prosser and Tadao Tomita, using a variety of electrophysiological approaches including voltage clamping via sucrose gap (65, 275, 374). These studies, and much of the earlier work, were summarized in detail by Professor Tomita (373).\n\nAfter development of single-cell voltage-clamp techniques, experiments on smooth muscle cells began in several labs, led by Thomas Bolton, Hiroshi Kuriyama, and the team of Josh Singer and John Walsh (25, 27, 28, 180, 222, 223, 349, 350). None of these studies, or studies performed in many other labs, recorded intrinsic electrical activity with the characteristics of slow waves from smooth muscle cells (96). Smooth muscle cells generated Ca2+ action potentials; in some cases these occurred spontaneously, or they could be elicited by depolarization (26). In one study action potentials with plateau components were recorded from colonic muscle cells of the dog (293); however, these events were blocked by dihydropyridines, making them dissimilar to the electrical slow waves of the canine colon (411). The general conclusion from a multitude of studies was that smooth muscle cells do not have the ionic apparatus required to generate slow waves or to be the pacemaker cells in GI muscles. Thus the term myogenic is incorrect. Another cell type in GI muscles, ICC, was suggested by morphologists (98, 369) to be the pacemaker cells because these cells are electrically coupled to smooth muscle cells. However, physiological verification of this hypothesis was needed.\n\nDissection experiments performed on several regions of the GI tract suggested that discrete regions of tissue provide pacemaker activity for the bulk of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers. Prosser and colleagues (64, 65) noted that separation of circular and longitudinal muscles of the small intestine left circular muscles inactive, but the longitudinal muscle layer retained pacemaker activity. They suggested that slow waves originate in longitudinal muscles and are amplified and propagated by circular muscles. Later studies, in which specific strata of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers were isolated, found that slow waves were generated in the region between the circular and longitudinal muscle in the stomach and small intestine (17, 137, 185). Similar studies on colon muscles isolated two pacemaker regions in the dog: the region between the circular and longitudinal muscle generated a 17 cycle/min electrical rhythm and a thin layer of tissue at the submucosal surface of the circular muscle layer generated a 6 cycle/min rhythm (354, 355). Pacemaker activity extended into the circular muscle layer along the septa that separated the circular muscle into bundles (412). ICC networks populated all of the specialized pacemaker regions (29, 30, 412). The next tasks were to disrupt ICC networks and determine effects on slow waves and to isolate ICC to determine whether these cells were capable of pacemaker activity.\n\nMethylene blue can be taken up by ICC in living tissues (a supravital dye), and the cells are damaged after exposure to high-intensity illumination (370). Damage to ICC by methylene blue exposure was associated with inhibition of slow wave activity. Methylene blue also has pharmacological effects on a variety of cells and causes, among other effects, significant depolarization of smooth muscle cells (328) and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (416). Sufficient depolarization (e.g., with elevated external K+ to the level produced by methylene blue) blocked slow waves (328). Thus the link between methylene blue labeling of ICC and the hypothesized pacemaker role of ICC was not clarified by experiments using methylene blue (370). Another supravital dye, rhodamine 123, accumulates in mitochondria, and ICC were considered to be a potential target for this dye because of their abundance of mitochondria. Rhodamine 123 is cytotoxic in some cells, so the effect of this dye on pacemaker activity was tested. Rhodamine 123 labeled ICC of the canine colon and blocked slow wave activity without the problem of substantial depolarization as observed with methylene blue (402). However, all cells have mitochondria, so cytotoxic effects in cells besides ICC may have been responsible for the effects of rhodamine 123 on pacemaker activity.\n\nDispersion of colonic smooth muscle tissues yielded smooth muscle cells and a few cells with an odd morphology. These cells had multiple short processes and a prominent nuclear region. Ultrastructural examination of the cells with processes showed them to have morphological features common to ICC (i.e., abundance of mitochondria, caveolae, and lack of thick filaments). Patch-clamp recordings under current-clamp conditions showed these cells generated spontaneous depolarization with characteristics similar to slow waves in colonic muscles (235). This was the first direct evidence that ICC of GI muscles have intrinsic pacemaker capability.\n\n1. ICC as pacemakers in the small intestine\n\nErratic contractions of intestinal muscles from mice treated with neutralizing c-Kit antibodies and in W/WV mutants suggested defects in electrical pacemaker activity (250). Further examination of the intestinal muscles of animals treated with c-Kit antibodies showed that ICC-MY, the network of ICC in the region identified as the pacemaker area in small intestine, were largely missing (378). Loss of ICC correlated with the absence of slow wave activity in animals treated with c-Kit antibodies. Small intestinal muscles of W/WV animals also lacked most ICC-MY. Electrical recordings from these mice showed that normal slow wave activity occurred in wild-type and heterozygotes, but were absent in small intestinal muscles of W/WV mice ( ) (167, 404). Additional studies utilizing mutants, such as Sl/Sld mice, in which the ligand for c-Kit (steel or stem cell factor) is deficient, also displayed loss of ICC-MY and pacemaker activity (262, 403). Collectively, these studies, exploiting several paradigms of ICC loss (e.g., loss of ICC after development and developmental failure), established the role of ICC as intestinal pacemakers.\n\nOther than the loss of ICC-MY, no other structural or developmental defects were noted in small intestines of c-Kit mutants or animals treated with c-Kit neutralizing antibodies. It is also important to note that ICC in the region of the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) appeared normal in W/WV and Sl/Sld mice. Intestinal motility was altered in c-Kit and stem cell factor mutants, but responses to stimulation of intrinsic enteric motor neurons were retained and smooth muscle tissues responded to neurotransmitters and generated Ca2+ action potentials (80, 251, 403). Complete loss of motor activity would prohibit intestinal transit, amounting to a fatal pseudo-obstruction of the bowel. However, W/WV mice live into adulthood without obvious loss of nutritional assimilation (56). A normal pattern of segmentation and peristaltic waves, observed in the small intestines of wild-type mice, was not present in W/WV mice. Intestinal muscles of these animals displayed action potentials and contractions, but these events were more random and less coordinated, leading to weakened propulsive activity (80).\n\nSurvival and apparent nutritional sufficiency in W/WV mice raises the question of the importance of ICC and slow waves. Loss of ICC-MY in W/WV mice resulted in a 10- to 17-mV depolarization in the smooth muscle syncytium (378, 403, 404). Depolarization alone was not responsible for loss of slow waves because this level of depolarization, as tested with elevated external K+, did not block slow waves (378). A second function of ICC-MY, therefore, appears to be setting membrane potential to more negative levels than would be accomplished by the intrinsic ionic conductances of smooth muscle cells. Thus ICC-MY in the small intestine shift the membrane potential of the integrated SIP syncytium from a range in which smooth muscle cells generate spontaneous action potentials to more negative potentials in which the open probability of Ca2+ channels is reduced, and the intrinsic excitability of smooth muscle cells is therefore suppressed between slow waves. Slow waves, superimposed upon the influence of ICC-MY on membrane potential, organize the generation of muscle action potentials and phasic contractions into the phasic pattern characteristic of the small intestine. The conductances responsible for the negative membrane potentials of ICC have not yet been determined.\n\n2. ICC as gastric pacemakers\n\nICC-MY are present in the gastric corpus and antrum of W/WV mice, but with application of neutralizing antibodies, lesions in gastric ICC-MY networks developed after 9–40 days in organotypic cultures (279). Slow waves were not recorded in regions of muscle where ICC-MY were lost but persisted in areas where ICC networks remained. Electrophysiological recording from guinea pig stomach also supported the hypothesis that ICC-MY are pacemakers in the stomach (82). When intracellular impalements were made, slow wave activity was recorded from circular smooth muscle cells, positively identified by dye filling during recording. More rarely, cells were impaled with much faster and larger amplitude slow wave events (termed driver potentials by these authors). The cells exhibiting driver potentials were between the muscle layers and had morphologies consistent with cells labeled with c-Kit antibodies. Simultaneous recording from ICC and nearby smooth muscle cells showed that the slow waves in ICC preceded the events in smooth muscle cells ( ). These investigators also recorded from longitudinal muscle cells, and the slow waves in these cells were similar in waveform to events in ICC but of reduced amplitude. The slow waves recorded from longitudinal muscle were termed follower potentials by these authors. Their results supported the hypothesis that ICC-MY generated slow waves and these events conducted to both circular and longitudinal muscle layers.\n\n3. ICC as colonic pacemakers\n\nICC are reduced in the colons of W/WV mice and in genetically similar Ws/Ws mutants in rats. However, the loss of ICC in the colon is incomplete, and therefore comparisons of activities in wild-type and mutant animals are not as clear-cut as in other regions of the GI tract. Proximal colons of wild-type rats and mice display a pattern of slow depolarization with superimposed clusters of action potentials (4). Action potential clusters were also observed in colonic muscles of Ws/Ws rats, but these events were irregular and slower in frequency than in wild-type colons.\n\nD. Mechanism and Modeling of Pacemaker Activity\n\nStudies to deduce the slow wave mechanism in whole GI muscles were frustrated by the inability to record selectively from ICC. This problem was solved by the elegant work of groups led by David Hirst and Hikaru Suzuki. As mentioned above, Dickens and co-workers (82) recorded from gastric pacemaker cells and confirmed that the recordings were made from ICC-MY by filling cells with fluorescent dyes during recording. Similar recordings of pacemaker activity were made from gastric and small intestinal ICC-MY (196, 198, 199), and the mechanism of slow waves was investigated using membrane potential recordings. Experiments using Itpr1−/− mice showed that loss of IP3 receptor type 1 blocked gastric slow waves (364). The IP3 receptor blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), although not entirely specific, also blocked slow waves in ICC-MY (196). However, this effect was accompanied by significant depolarization, and sufficient depolarization alone can reduce or block slow wave generation. Treatments with a variety of pharmacological antagonists and ion channel blockers confirmed the general concept that slow waves consist of two components: the initial component (upstroke) was sensitive to Ni2+ and reduced by extracellular Ca2+, and the second (plateau) was sensitive to caffeine, cyclopiazonic acid, and Cl− channel blockers (155, 196, 198, 199). Reducing extracellular Cl− also reduced the plateau potential. Multiple ionic conductances are at play in cells of the SIP syncytium. Blocking conductances or Ca2+ handling mechanisms in one type of cell or altering ionic gradients might impose effects on ionic mechanisms in coupled cells. Thus definitive explanations for the pacemaker mechanism were limited until ICC could be isolated for single-cell voltage-clamp studies.\n\n1. Studies of pacemaker activity in cultured ICC\n\nc-Kit+ cells developed in cell culture, and therefore cultured cells were used in many studies to investigate the mechanism of slow wave rhythmicity. After a few days in primary culture, single cells or networks of cells with c-Kit immunoreactivity can be identified, and these cells generated spontaneous inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions (208, 368). The inward currents reversed 10–20 mV positive to 0 mV, and the currents were not blocked by dihydropyrdines. In current-clamp mode, spontaneous slow wave-like depolarization transients were observed that corresponded to the frequency of inward currents in voltage-clamp. These events displayed waveforms and mimicked some of the pharmacology of slow waves in intact muscles; however, the frequency was lower in cultured cells. Several labs have studied the ionic conductances expressed and the mechanism of spontaneous electrical rhythmicity in cultured ICC models. The inward current was generally linked to a nonselective cation conductance; however, one group suggested the inward currents were more consistent with a Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance on the basis of reversal potentials and block by SITS (372). Ion channels expressed in cultured c-Kit positive cells and concepts of electrical rhythmicity were summarized in a previous review (331), and a mathematical model was developed based on these ideas (101, 102).\n\nProblems developed with cultured cell models of ICC. ICC make up <10% of the cells in the tunica muscularis, so enzymatic dispersion of GI muscles results in a relatively small percentage of ICC in the myriad of cells obtained. Gene or protein expression studies on these cells are likely to be no more specific than expression studies on whole muscle extracts. The relative abundance of c-Kit+ cells after various periods of time in culture and the effects of growth media on retention of c-Kit expression have not been determined, so it is unknown whether the c-Kit + cell population increases or decreases relative to other cells as a function of time in culture. Some investigators have tested growing c-Kit+ cells on a layer of cells expressing stem cell factor, and this promising approach enhanced the number and growth of c-Kit+ cells (308). However, these studies included few evaluations of the molecular and functional phenotype of ICC. Most investigations of cultured c-Kit+ cells have been performed without the benefit of a reporter molecule expressed in ICC for the purpose of unequivocal identification. Initial labeling with antibodies to confirm the presence of c-Kit immunopositive cells (208, 368) is not performed on all cells sampled for electrical recording. Cells were selected for recording on the basis of gross morphology. Thus it is possible that the cells from which molecular evaluations or physiological recordings were made were confused with other cell types in mixed cell populations from which the cultures were grown. Some investigators have performed purification steps before culturing, such as immunoselection or FACS (276); however, tests to certify cell purity have been rather limited.\n\nAs networks of c-Kit+ cells develop in culture, they experience changes in phenotype within a few days. However, few tests verifying the fidelity of the native phenotype have been performed on cultured c-Kit+ cells. A genomic study of freshly dispersed ICC from the murine small intestine produced a catalog of highly expressed genes that could provide a standard for validation of the ICC phenotype (52). Our own experience with cultured ICC was that the conductances responsible for slow waves in situ were lost within a few days in primary culture (436). Therefore, we have concluded that the mechanisms of rhythmicity reviewed previously (331) may largely be artifacts of cell culture. This experience should raise caution about conclusions based on studies of cultured c-Kit+ cells that are not accompanied by careful verification that the mechanisms and pathways observed are equivalent in the native phenotype. For this reason, little space in this review is devoted to the many ion channels, agonist responses, and slow wave mechanisms that have been reported from studies of cultured c-Kit+ cells.\n\n2. Studies of pacemaker activity in freshly isolated ICC\n\nA main concern about the activity recorded from cultured ICC-like cells was that they lacked the ability to be paced by application of current pulses. This was a fundamental and important difference between the behavior of cultured cells and whole muscles, which can be paced (296). Due to skepticism about the behavior of cultured cells, Akinori Noma and colleagues (125) sought to study ICC from the myenteric region (pacemaker region) of the mouse small intestine. These authors developed a unique dispersion technique that did not disrupt the anatomical orientation of the cells from myenteric plexus region but liberated cells that could be voltage clamped. ICC-MY, verified by immunolabling of unfixed tissues, had an average whole cell capacitance of 25 pF. ICC had resting potentials of −72 mV and generated spontaneous transient depolarizations under current clamp and large inward currents under voltage clamp. The inward currents were termed “autonomous currents,” because once these currents were initiated by depolarization, they displayed an autonomous time course of ∼500 ms. Autonomous currents were attributed to a nonselective cation conductance. Autonomous currents displayed what appeared to be inactivation properties, but inactivation was characteristically different from the Marcovian behavior of voltage-dependent ion channels. It was concluded that activation and deactivation of autonomous currents depended on intracellular mechanisms that responded to depolarization and regulated channel openings. It was also shown that replacing the extracellular solution with one that was nominally free of Ca2+ caused gradual reduction in the amplitude of autonomous currents, suggesting that Ca2+ stores were an important component in activation of autonomous currents. Demonstration of autonomous currents in freshly isolated ICC was an important step in understanding the cellular mechanism of pacemaker activity and a potent indication of the loss of function occurring via remodeling of ICC in cell culture.\n\nProduction of a reporter strain of mice in which ICC were labeled constitutively by expression of a green fluorescent protein (Kit+/copGFP) made it possible to identify ICC in mixed cell dispersions of the tunica muscularis and perform experiments soon after enzymatic dispersion (311, 436). Tmem16a (official name now is Ano1) had previously been identified as one of the most highly expressed genes in ICC by a gene array screen of the ICC transcriptome (52), but the function of the protein encoded by Tmem16a was unknown at the time. In 2008 the gene product of Tmem16a was found to be a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (Anoctamin 1 or ANO1) (48, 336, 426). Immunohistochemical studies showed that ANO1 was highly expressed in ICC of several species, including humans (122, 163, 172).\n\nICC freshly isolated from Kit+/copGFP mice display a large-amplitude inward current that was activated by depolarization and followed a time course similar to the current previously identified as “autonomous current” (125). However, the reversal potential of the current in freshly isolated ICC indicated that a Cl− conductance was responsible for the large-amplitude inward currents activated by depolarization (436). The Cl− conductance displayed unusual activation properties: a very sharp increase in current was noted with depolarizations in the range of −70 and −50 mV and a voltage-dependent delay in activation was observed at near-threshold potentials. At potentials positive to the activation threshold, the current developed to maximum amplitude and was linearly dependent on the Cl− gradient. The voltage dependence of activation was not fit by a Boltzmann function, and therefore, the underlying conductance was not likely to be voltage dependent. Activation of the conductance was blocked by Ni2+, replacement of extracellular Ca2+ with Ba2+, or exclusion of Ca2+ from the extracellular solution. These and other experiments suggested that activation of the inward current was due to an initial transient influx of Ca2+, and the delay in activation with near-threshold depolarizations may have been due to minimal Ca2+ influx at more negative steps. ICC also expressed a single-channel, Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance of 7.8 pS, which is similar to the conductance of ANO1 channels expressed in HEK cells (426). ICC currents were blocked by niflumic acid with an IC50 of 4.8 μM. Under current clamp, ICC discharged spontaneous depolarizations that mimicked the properties of slow waves in intact muscles. The spontaneous depolarization events were also blocked by niflumic acid. As described in the next paragraph, the Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance appears to be responsible for slow waves in GI muscles, so the current activated in single ICC was referred to as the “slow wave current.”\n\nExperiments on intact muscles suggested that a component of slow waves was due to a Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance (e.g., the plateau phase of slow waves was blocked by treating tissues with membrane permeable Ca2+ buffers, niflumic acid, and by removal of extracellular Cl−) (153, 198). Cl− channel blockers were also found to reduce the frequency and block slow waves in murine, monkey, and human small intestine and stomach (172). However, it should be noted that the concentration sensitivity for these effects varied between organs and species with gastric muscles of monkeys being the most sensitive to niflumic acid. ICC express several splice variants of Ano1 (172), and it is possible that the variable sensitivity to Cl− blockers and/or the differences in the waveforms of slow waves might be due to variations in the complement of Ano1 isoforms expressed in different regions of the GI tract. The role of ANO1 channels in slow waves was further tested using Tmem16−/− (Tmem16atm1Bdh/tm1Bdh) mice (313). Previous studies had shown that ∼80% of mice with congenital deactivation of ANO1 channels died within a week after birth. Experiments were performed, therefore, on newborn animals and after slow waves developed further in organotypic cultures (406). All mice of several litters were assayed for electrical slow waves by intracellular recording and then genotyped later for Tmem16atm1Bdh alleles. Newborn Tmem16a−/− mice displayed no slow wave activity while normal slow wave activity was recorded from mice with one or both wild-type alleles. After 6 days in organotypic culture, slow waves developed and increased in amplitude in mice with wild-type alleles but were absent in muscles of Tmem16a−/− mice. Mice of some litters were allowed to develop for up to 23 days after birth. No slow waves were recorded from gastric and small intestinal muscles from Tmem16a−/− mice, but normal slow waves were recorded from siblings with wild-type alleles. These data strongly support the hypothesis that Cl− channels, encoded by Ano1 (Tmem16a), are responsible for slow waves in GI muscles and justify the term slow wave current to describe the large-amplitude inward currents initiated spontaneously and by depolarization of single ICC.\n\n3. The “clock” driving the pacemaker mechanism in ICC\n\nInsight into the clock mechanism driving slow waves was provided by studies on gastric muscles from the guinea pig (155). The intervals between slow waves were tabulated and found to vary around a fairly tight mean value, and the interval was not dictated by neural inputs to the muscle. The interval between slow waves was tightly linked to the duration of slow waves, and the probability of initiating the next slow wave increased from low values immediately after repolarization of the past slow wave until the next event. The increase in excitability was linked to the discharge of small-amplitude spontaneous transient depolarizations (STDs, or “unitary potentials,” as termed by the authors). The increase in probability of STDs was associated with activation of a full-amplitude slow wave. STDs are commonly recorded from cells within intact networks of ICC in situ (155, 196–199, 383) and can be conducted to and recorded from smooth muscle cells in small strips of muscle (21, 45, 155, 197). STD activity is lost from smooth muscle recordings when ICC are absent (45). Single ICC also generate STDs, and these events are due to transient activation of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents (436, 437). Stochastic generation of STDs in ICC within networks of pacemaker cells (155) leads to activation of the voltage-dependent process linked to activation of slow wave currents (436). There is still speculation about the nature of the voltage-dependent process. Our group has favored voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry, mainly via T-type Ca2+ channels, as the voltage-dependent mechanism (194, 433) because reduced extracelluar Ca2+, Ni2+, and mibefradil can block slow wave generation and slow or block the propagation slow waves in intact muscles and generation of slow wave currents in single ICC (20, 405, 411, 413, 436). The α1H isoform (Cacna1h) has been suggested as the T-channels responsible for slow wave propagation (120). Others have suggested a mechanism involving voltage-dependent activation of IP3 formation or voltage-dependent sensitization of IP3 receptors (153, 273, 383). More experiments will be needed to resolve this controversy.\n\nIt is important to note that every type of ICC from which electrical recordings have been made displays STDs; however, only some ICC are capable of generating slow waves (196–199, 436, 437). This suggests that the basic pacemaker mechanism (i.e., STDs) is an intrinsic feature of ICC; however, some ICC lack the voltage-dependent mechanism(s) required for STDs to summate into slow wave currents or to propagate slow waves actively (see section below). The simplest explanation for the inability of some classes of ICC to generate slow waves is that these cells lack the voltage-dependent mechanism(s) responsible for initiation of slow wave currents (see ).\n\nCa2+ handling mechanisms that control activation of ANO1 channels are not well understood at present. It seems clear that release of Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores via IP3 receptors is required for generation of slow waves (364), but sources of Ca2+ for filling of stores, initiation, or amplification of Ca2+ transients by Ca2+ entry or ryanodine receptors, and the role of Na+/Ca2+ exchange are controversial. The Ca2+ sensor that is either intrinsic to ANO1 or provided by an accessory protein has also not been identified. Finally, the role of excluded volumes that might occur because of close apposition between stores and the plasma membrane are not understood. At present, our best concept of the slow wave mechanism is illustrated in . In spite of many uncertain elements, there have been numerous recent attempts at modeling pacemaker behavior in ICC (42, 101, 102, 384, 428). Simulations of pacemaker activity of ICC are improving, and the models and refinements provided by further experimentation will be very useful in planning future experiments and in predicting the actions of therapeutic agents on electrical rhythmicity in the gut.\n\nE. Role of ICC in Propagation of Slow Waves\n\n1. Extracellular electrical recording from visceral smooth muscles\n\nA great deal of the information about GI pacemaker activity used by gastroenterologists to make diagnoses, biomedical scientists in testing hypotheses and drugs, and instructors for teaching GI physiology has been deduced from studies using electrical recordings made with extracellular metal electrodes laid against or fastened to the serosal or mucosal surfaces of GI organs or applied to the abdomen (i.e., electrogastrograms). Studies of this sort have been performed for almost 100 years; however, a recent report raises questions about the validity of results obtained with this method (18). Activity was recorded from murine gastric sheets in an attempt to relate electrical activity to the aberrant motility patterns in mutant mice with dysmotility phenotypes. These studies utilized monopolar or bipolar recording via silver electrodes arranged into arrays, as used commonly in many recent studies (e.g., Refs. 87, 227, 274, 390). Biopotentials detected by these electrodes were monitored by standard techniques, and it was noted that the frequency of gastric slow waves was significantly lower than the frequencies observed when intracellular electrical recording were made from intact gastric sheets (103, 104). When contractions were blocked by dihydropyridines or wortmannin (both drugs chosen to block contractions downstream of the mechanism that generates slow waves), extracellular biopotentials were abolished. Impalement of cells in muscles, however, showed that the drugs had no effect on slow wave amplitude or frequency. By combining imaging of muscle movements with extracellular recording, it became apparent that very small muscular movements (<50 μm) were capable of generating voltage transients several tens of microvolts in amplitude (i.e., equivalent to the events typically considered to be slow waves). Thus extracellular electrical recording from visceral smooth muscles may be largely artifacts of contractile movements. In exploring the lengthy literature in which extracellular recording has been used to monitor the electrical activity of the GI tract, it is apparent that controls for movement artifacts have been neglected. Thus it is reasonable to be skeptical about the results of classic studies that have based major conclusions upon this technique. Future investigations using extracellular recordings will need to demonstrate the validity of these recordings by control experiments in which recording fidelity is maintained after rigorous stabilization of movement. A recent study claiming maintenance of extracellular recording fidelity after infusion of a dihydropyrdine into pig intestine in vivo relied only upon visual inspection to ensure that movement was blocked (10). This study, while clearly seeking to prove the fidelity of extracellular recording, falls well short of a suitable control study for extracellular recording, because: 1) dihydropyridines don't block all contractile movements in many species, 2) no concentration/effect data for dihydropyridines were provided, 3) movements of the viscera due to respiration and pulsatile blood flow could not possibly have been absent in a living animal, and 4) more rigorous monitoring of movement than visual inspection would be needed to detect the small movements capable of eliciting electrical artifacts.\n\nDifficulties in recording authentic electrical activity in GI muscles with extracellular electrodes are likely due to the structure of ICC networks, the fact that ICC capable of regenerative propagation are buried within muscle layers, and the magnitude and kinetics of transmembrane currents responsible for slow waves. In contrast to the heart, in which cardiac myocytes actively regenerate action potentials along a coherent wave front, the gut has a thin and relatively sparse network of ICC generating the transmembrane currents responsible for slow waves. The velocity of the upstroke phase of slow waves is ∼100-fold less than the upstroke velocity of cardiac action potentials, indicating much lower current densities during slow wave depolarizations. Field potentials resulting from slow waves are far weaker than the field potentials generated by cardiac and skeletal muscles or neurons and may be lost in the noise of recording.\n\n2. Propagation of slow waves in intact muscle strips\n\nMotility patterns in the gut depend on coordination of millions of smooth muscle cells. For example, in gastric motility, slow waves originate in the proximal corpus and peristaltic contractions spread over many square centimeters of the stomach. Timing of contractions is accomplished by active propagation of slow waves around and along the tubelike GI organs. GI muscles display clear properties of active slow wave propagation, and several studies have characterized propagation using intracellular recordings to determine propagation velocities of slow waves initiated from known sites of pacing. These studies have typically used muscle strips or sheets from larger animals to obtain cable lengths sufficient to resolve temporal separation of slow waves recorded from two points. In the canine antrum, for example, slow wave propagation velocity was measured at 20–60 mm/s in the circumferential direction (long axis of circular muscle fibers) and ∼10 mm/s in the longitudinal direction (long axis of longitudinal muscle fibers) (17, 20). The precise explanation for the anisotropy in propagation velocities is unknown. Slow waves display refractory properties, as do excitable events other in excitable cells and cell networks. In the canine antrum, the period between slow waves required for complete restoration of slow wave upstroke velocity, amplitude, and duration is at least 10 s (296), demonstrating the long latencies required for resetting Ca2+ entry/release mechanisms and ion channels required for slow wave generation and propagation. In fact, ion channel recovery from inactivation is categorically much quicker than the long refractory period of slow waves, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as reloading of intracellular Ca2+ stores, is likely to be the rate-limiting step in slow wave frequency and responsible for long periods of refractoriness.\n\nICC have a critical role in slow wave propagation because these cells provide the pathway for active propagation in GI muscles. Smooth muscle cells lack the ionic apparatus necessary to regenerate slow waves. Thus a coupled network of ICC is required for coherent propagation of slow waves and coordination of contractions ( ). This point was demonstrated by dissection experiments in which bits of tissue containing pacemaker cells were removed from muscles of the canine colon. In intact muscles, slow waves of uniform amplitude were recorded from cells along the submucosal surface of the circular muscle layer, and active propagation of slow waves occurred in this region. Slow wave activity was lost if a thin band of tissue along the submucosal surface (containing pacemaker ICC-SM) was removed, and slow waves decayed within a few millimeters from a region with the pacemaker cell network intact (332). A similar phenomenon was observed in gastric muscles treated with neutralizing c-Kit antibodies, slow waves were generated in areas where clusters of ICC were retained, but these events did not propagate to regions devoid of ICC (279). Furthermore, after loss of ICC, gastric muscles could not be paced by application of current pulses.\n\nRecordings of slow waves in ICC and from nearby smooth muscle cells demonstrate how slow waves conduct via electrical coupling into smooth muscle cells. Large-amplitude slow waves were recorded in ICC, and much attenuated slow waves were recorded from nearby smooth muscle cells (82, 155, 196, 198, 199). Hirst and colleagues (68) described the electrical coupling between ICC and smooth muscle cells as weak and showed that conduction of slow waves is similar to conduction of electrotonic potentials between these cells. Taken together, these studies suggest that slow waves, generated by the ICC, conduct passively into the smooth muscle syncytium and are not actively regenerated by smooth muscle cells. Thus active (regenerative) propagation of slow waves by ICC-MY is another central function of these cells. Unlike the heart that is paced from discrete clusters of pacemaker cells and action potentials propagate via the regenerative mechanisms in cardiac myocytes, the gut requires a continuum of ICC for regenerative (active) propagation of slow waves. This feature has important consequences in pathophysiological circumstances where loss of some ICC might uncouple regions of ICC networks or reduce the safety factor for propagation, thus preventing normal coherent spread of slow waves and causing loss of contractile coordination.\n\nA comment should be included about the form of electrical coupling between ICC-MY and smooth muscle cells because some authors have claimed that gap junctions between these cells cannot be found by electron microscopy and have proposed alternative methods of electrical coupling, including structures called peg-and-socket junctions (371) or electrical field coupling (360). Whether some form of ephaptic communication could be effective in conducting slow waves from ICC-MY to smooth muscle cells seems unlikely and has not been demonstrated. Gap junctions between these cells may be rare and small in size, and these structures have been observed between ICC-MY and smooth muscle cells in some species (331). Direct electrical measurements have shown that electrical coupling between ICC-MY and smooth muscle cells is weak (68), and this may result from few and small gap junctions.\n\nICC-IM in corpus and antral muscles also appear to have regenerative capabilities that can sustain circumferential propagation of slow waves. Hirst and colleagues (152, 154) noted that ICC-MY formed a dense network along the greater curvature, but this population of ICC was greatly diminished or missing near the lesser curvature in rodent stomachs. In spite of the decrease in ICC-MY, slow waves propagated from the greater curvature to the lesser curvature with little decrease in amplitude (152). These authors also found that ICC-IM in the corpus were capable of a relatively fast rate of spontaneous slow wave generation and suggested that these cells are the source of the higher frequency slow waves in the corpus. They viewed activation of the gastric musculature in the following manner: 1) ICC-IM generate corporal slow waves, and these events determine the dominant frequency in the stomach; 2) slow waves from ICC-IM activate slow waves in the ICC-MY network, and these events spread down the stomach; 3) slow waves conduct into bundles of smooth muscle cells, elicit depolarization, and initiate contractions; and 4) depolarization also initiates active responses in ICC-IM (referred to as regenerative potentials) which spread rapidly along the long axis of these cells in circumferential bands (81). In order for this mechanism to work, ICC-IM in the corpus and antrum must have a voltage-dependent mechanism that is primed to provide cell-to-cell regeneration of slow waves. Cellular studies of ICC-IM have been limited, but a voltage-dependent mechanism intrinsic to ICC-IM has not yet been identified. Such a mechanism could be present in ICC-IM or in the septal ICC (ICC-SEP) that run between bundles of smooth muscle cells because small bundles of gastric muscle, that likely contain both ICC-IM and ICC-SEP, are capable of regenerative propagation (383).\n\nThere may be significant differences between the ICC-IM in different parts of the stomach. In laboratory animals ICC in fundus muscle bundles do not display voltage-dependent regenerative mechanisms (21), whereas the ICC within bundles in the distal stomach can generate active responses to depolarization or upon break from hyperpolarization (153, 383). There are clearly many things to learn about the interactions between ICC and the specific ionic properties of different classes of ICC before slow wave propagation is fully understood or can be modeled accurately.\n\n3. Ca2+ imaging to study mechanism and propagation of pacemaker activity\n\nIntracellular Ca2+ transients are responsible for the spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) that generate STDs in ICC. Depolarization from STDs triggers global Ca2+ transients that activate whole cell slow wave currents ( ). Imaging of Ca2+ transients with Ca2+ sensitive dyes has been used to characterize propagation of pacemaker activity in networks of ICC in situ (146, 283). ICC take up Ca2+ indicators, such as fluo 4, making it possible to resolve cyclical Ca2+ transients in ICC that correspond to slow waves, and simultaneous recording of Ca2+ transients and slow waves showed 1:1 correlation between these events. Ca2+ transients provide a window and cell-specific detail on pacemaker activity that is not possible with electrical recording. Studies using ICC-specific expression of molecular probes, such as GCaMP, will be a powerful new technique for studying slow wave propagation in intact GI muscles and organs.\n\nCa2+ imaging studies on guinea pig and mouse tissues in vitro reinforced the concept that slow wave generation is stochastic in nature (155), because events within a network of ICC in sheets of muscle are generated from variable points and propagation within a network occurs via often changing pathways (146, 283). Activation of a network of ICC is directed from the first cell to reach threshold, but this position of leadership changes from cycle to cycle. Creation of spatiotemporal maps from video images allows visualization of direction and velocity of activity fronts. Ca2+ imaging also reinforced the pacemaker role for ICC-MY because Ca2+ transients in closely spaced ICC-MY and smooth muscle cells occur sequentially ( ), as would be expected if slow waves, generated in ICC-MY, initiated depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in neighboring smooth muscle cells (146, 147, 283). Average propagation velocities of wave fronts in ICC networks in the mouse were between 2–6 mm/s, and therefore consistent with the velocities of slow wave propagation in murine muscles. The propagation velocity of Ca2+ transients associated with slow waves greatly exceeds the rates of Ca2+ waves that result only from diffusion (10–50 μm/s) (367), supporting the idea that slow wave propagation depends on a voltage-dependent mechanism.\n\nThe mechanism of propagation was investigated by imaging of Ca2+ dynamics in ICC networks, and these studies showed that electrical coupling between cells was fundamental to the organization of propagating Ca2+ transients (283). Treatment of ICC-MY networks with 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction uncoupler, did not block Ca2+ transients in individual cells, but blocked the spread of transients through the network. After 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, individual cells paced at their intrinsic frequencies, which varied from cell to cell, and failed to be entrained by a dominant pacemaker frequency in the network. By tabulating the time course of Ca2+ transients in multiple cells within a network, it was possible to characterize the cellular sequence of activation and the time course of cellular transients event to event. This analysis showed that the activation sequence (i.e., spread of slow waves through a network) varies even when the direction of propagation remains constant. The time lag in activation between adjacent cells also varied from cycle to cycle, likely reflecting the dynamics of refractoriness and excitability of individual cells. These properties are consistent with the cablelike properties of a complex two- or three-dimensional network of excitable cells.\n\nImaging studies also support the hypothesis that the voltage-dependent mechanism for propagation is Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent, possibly T-type Ca2+ channels (283). Nicardipine did not affect Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY, but greatly reduced or blocked Ca2+ transients in smooth muscle cells. Ni2+ (100 μM) severely disrupted Ca2+ transients, and mibefradil blocked Ca2+ transients propagating through ICC networks. Drugs, such as cyclopiazonic acid (10 μM) and 2-APB (50 μM), which affect intracellular Ca2+ handling mechanisms, reduced the frequency of ICC-MY Ca2+ transients, and ryanodine (10 μM) did not affect frequency but reduced the amplitude of these events. These data are consistent with the idea that Ca2+ entry entrains the discharge of localized Ca2+ release events, generates whole cell Ca2+ transients, and facilitates propagation of slow wave currents in ICC networks.\n\nImaging has also been used to study pacemaker activity and propagation in larger animals and human muscles, and these studies have allowed generalizations to be made about the role of ICC in pacemaker activity and the mechanism for pacemaking. For example, studies on muscles of the human jejunum showed Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY with characteristics similar to the events in murine muscles (241). The Ca2+ transients in human ICC-MY were biphasic in nature, and the initial component was sensitive to Ni2+ and mibefradil. Ca2+ transients in human jejunal ICC-MY were not affected by dihydropyridines, but were reduced or blocked by cyclopiazonic acid and 2-APB. Because slow waves spread passively (i.e., with decrement) into smooth muscle bundles, electrical events cannot penetrate very far into the depth of thicker muscles of larger animals and humans (412). However, ICC lying within the septa (ICC-SEP) between muscle bundles in these tissues were found to activate sequentially as a function of distance from ICC-MY in the human small intestine (242). Thus propagation of slow waves through ICC-SEP drives depolarization of smooth muscle cells deep within smooth muscle bundles.\n\nThere are two pacemaker regions in the canine colon, each producing different frequencies of pacemaker events (354). Interesting differences were observed in the activation and propagation of Ca2+ transients in ICC in the submucosal pacemaker area (ICC-SM), that produce slow waves, and ICC-MY, that produce faster oscillations, called myenteric potential oscillations. Rhythmic Ca2+ transients (5–8/min) spread without decrement through the ICC-SM network, but Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY (16/min) were typically unsynchronized in adjacent cells. Excitatory neural inputs synchronized the Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY. These findings demonstrate the diversity of behaviors and pacemaker frequencies found in ICC from different parts of the GI tract. Why ICC with different pacemaker frequencies, voltage dependencies, and synchronization between cells develop in different regions of the GI tract and what factors are responsible for pacemaker diversity are unknown at the present time.\n\n4. Relating Ca2+ transients in ICC to motor patterns of GI organs\n\nComparing the activation and propagation of Ca2+ transients in wild-type and W/WV mutants provided a means of determining the role of ICC-MY in regulating motor patterns in the small intestine ( ) (147). In the mouse Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY precede transients in adjacent longitudinal muscle fibers by 66–127 ms. The frequency of Ca2+ transients in muscle fibers (30 cpm), variability in the intervals between transients (∼7%), and propagation velocities (∼4 mm/s) in the longitudinal muscle layers of wild-type mice were similar in flat sheets of tunica muscularis, isolated intestinal segments, or exteriorized loops of intestine. In exteriorized loops Ca2+ transients were observed around the circumference of the intestine and were constrained within a band ∼1.5 mm in length. Ca2+ transients in longitudinal muscle cells preceded longitudinal shortening and circular contraction by ∼1 s. Contractions in wild-type mice were stable, most prominent in the longitudinal axis, and originated at the oral ends of preparations. Forceful contractions were also observed in muscles of W/WV mice; however, contractions were abrupt in onset and uncoordinated compared with the contractile patterns of wild-type mice. The velocity of propagation of Ca2+ transients in longitudinal muscles was about six times faster than propagation in wild-type small intestine, and origination sites of Ca2+ transients were highly unstable. Ca2+ transients propagated over smaller areas, and frequent collisions of Ca2+ transients were apparent.\n\nICC-MY facilitate coherent propagation of electrical activity which provides organization for muscle depolarization, Ca2+ transients, and contractions (147). When ICC are reduced in number, smooth muscle cells escape from the discipline of slow waves and revert to intrinsic excitability mechanisms. After loss of slow waves, smooth muscle cells generate spontaneous action potentials, and there is little segment-wide regulation of the timing of action potentials. Thus the motor behavior in the absence of ICC-MY differs considerably from normal motility patterns. Contractions are less circumferential, directional organization of contractions decreases, and action potentials and contractions generated from random sites often collide.\n\nSlow waves can propagate for long distances through ICC networks, providing organization of contractile activity at the organ level. The time constants of the SIP syncytium do not favor propagation of action potentials, and therefore, regenerative propagation of action potentials tends to be limited to a small cluster of cells (2). Smaller regions of muscle, synchronized only by action potentials, produce less organized and weakened contractions observed in small intestines of W/WV mice (80). Thus, while muscles and organs lacking ICC-MY still generate spontaneous electrical activity and contractions, the loss of the rhythmic depolarization-repolarization cycle provided by clock-like slow waves leads to abnormal and less efficient intestinal motility.\n\nF. Role of Interstitial Cells in Neurotransmission\n\nAn early idea proposed by Cajal (47) was that interstitial cells are primitive neurons providing connectivity between autonomic nerve fibers and effector tissues. We now know that ICC are not neurons and do not develop from precursors from the neural crest as do the neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system (238, 379, 430). However, the idea that ICC mediate inputs from enteric motor neurons has developed dramatically in recent years. This idea has been a controversial topic in ICC research because several investigators have reported that contractile responses to nerve stimulation are retained in animals lacking some or most of the ICC thought to mediate neural inputs (ICC-IM). The debate about the role of ICC in neurotransmission was discussed in recent reviews (126, 329) and is summarized in this review. Resolving this controversy is important because regulating motor input to visceral smooth muscle organs may provide a means for therapeutic regulation of motor activity. Understanding the postjunctional mechanisms for transduction of neural inputs and how these signals are linked to excitation-contraction coupling are fundamental to understanding the reasons for many motor defects in the GI tract.\n\nSome types of ICC (and PDGFRα+ cells, as discussed below) are distributed in a manner that would facilitate innervation by motor neurons ( ). The cells termed ICC-IM (or ICC-DMP in small intestine) and PDGFRα+-IM lie along the projections of excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons within bundles of muscle fibers in most regions of the gut. These interstitial cells form gap junctions with smooth muscle cells. Close associations with varicosities of motor neurons and electrical connectivity with smooth muscle cells are suggestive, but not proof, of a role for these cells in neurotransmission or neuromodulation. Morphologists noted very close contacts between ICC and varicosities of enteric motor neurons with electron microscopy, and Imaizumi and Hama (179), for example, suggested that “…the interstitial cell may play a role in transmitting stimuli received from the axon to surrounding smooth muscle cells by an electrotonic response.” This comment, and the original idea of Cajal, stimulated further investigation of ICC in neurotransmission. A morphometric study of the lower esophageal sphincter performed by Edwin Daniel and Virginia Posey-Daniel revealed an abundance of extremely close contacts (<20 nm) between varicosities and ICC and far fewer of these contacts between varicosities and smooth muscle cells (73). These authors suggested that if “intercalation” of ICC between motor nerve terminals and smooth muscle cells was prevalent, then “…attempts to define the characteristics of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic junction potentials in smooth muscle and compare them with effects of putative mediators may be misleading. If the smooth muscle junction potential is produced after electrotonic transmission from interstitial cells and its characteristics are determined by events in the interstitial cells, then there is no reason to expect coincidence of effects of nerve-released and exogenously added mediators. The first may act directly on interstitial cells and the second on smooth muscle cells as well as on interstitial cells, with the action on smooth muscle cells likely to be predominant.” This comment turned out to be an important signpost in the course of study of enteric motor neurotransmission.\n\n1. Loss of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in muscles of W/WV mice\n\nIn most regions of the GI tract, ICC-IM are closely associated (<20 nm gaps) with varicosities of motor neurons and form gap junctions with adjacent smooth muscle cells. ICC-IM are greatly reduced in numbers in gastric muscles of W/WV mice (45). Electrical field stimulation of wild-type muscles evokes excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials in the fundus, and both nitrergic and cholinergic junction potentials were reduced significantly in muscles of W/WV mice with reduced ICC-IM (45, 365, 400). Loss of these responses was not due to failure of motor neurons to develop and innervate muscle bundles or to release neurotransmitters, and responses were not lost because smooth muscle cells lost sensitivity to ACh and nitric oxide (NO). Contractile responses to exogenous transmitters were similar in wild-type and W/WV muscles. The membrane hyperpolarization response to NO donors was greatly reduced in W/WV muscles, but muscle relaxation caused by NO donors was of similar magnitude in wild-type and W/WV muscles. Thus different mechanisms appear to mediate nitrergic responses in ICC-IM and smooth muscle cells. The importance of one mechanism might be emphasized in wild-type muscles and compensated for by redundant mechanisms in muscle cells that develop in the absence of ICC-IM. ICC-IM were also greatly reduced in numbers, and inhibitory and excitatory junction potentials were reduced in muscles of Steel mutants (Sl/Sld) that lack membrane-bound stem cell factor (403). Lower esophageal and pyloric sphincter muscles of W/WV mice (408) and small intestinal muscles treated with neutralizing antibodies to c-Kit (407) also displayed reduced populations of ICC-IM (ICC-DMP in small intestinal muscles) and reduced postjunctional responses to stimulation of enteric motor neurons. From these studies, it was reasoned that loss of ICC-IM results in reduced connectivity between enteric motor neurons and smooth muscle cells, and ICC-IM have an important role in transducing motor neurotransmitters in GI muscles.\n\n2. Close contacts between nerves and effector cells in visceral motor neurotransmission\n\nThere have been many reports about the close connectivity between enteric motor nerve varicosities and ICC (see sect. IIA; and ); however, few quantitative studies on this subject have been provided. Clearly, very close (<20 nm) connections with varicosities are not exclusive to ICC, and a few studies (73, 110, 264) have described similar connections between neurons and smooth muscle cells. One of these studies, using a morphometric approach, concluded that close connections were more prevalent between varicosities and ICC (73). A quantitative understanding of the structural features of motor innervation is important, because this may provide spatial parameters necessary for modeling the dynamic profiles of neurotransmitters released from motor neurons. Basic questions regarding enteric motor neurotransmission, such as the nature and molecular specializations of neural active zones (i.e., neurotransmitter release sites), probabilities of vesicle or neurotransmitter release from varicosities per impulse, number of transmitter molecules released upon vesicle fusion, effects of frequency on types and quantities of neurotransmitters released, prejunctional modulation of transmitter release, metabolic and uptake pathways involved in deactivation of neurotransmitter signals, and dynamics of neurotransmitter concentrations in postjunctional volumes are poorly understood (329). Thus discussions about whether “volume” or “synaptic-like” neurotransmission dominate in muscles of the GI tract are speculative at present. Even if volume transmission seems likely from rigorous consideration of morphological details (110), the extent to which effective neurotransmitter concentrations reach postjunctional receptors depends on the many factors listed above.\n\n3. Expression and function of receptors and effectors of neural responses in interstitial cells\n\nUse of immunohistochemical techniques and isolation of smooth muscle and interstitial cells has allowed evaluations of the expression of receptors and effects of neurotransmitter responses and comparative responsiveness of specific populations of postjunctional cells. In some cases an immunohistochemical approach (i.e., functional immunohistochemistry) can be also useful in determining which cells respond to neurotransmitters released from motor neurons because specific changes in postjunctional signaling proteins (e.g., phosphorylation, generation of second messengers, and protein translocations) can be determined.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the physiological receptor for NO, is highly expressed in ICC. The inhibitory effects of NO and NO-dependent enteric inhibitory neurotransmission in GI muscles are blocked by inhibitors of sGC as shown in several studies by the effects of 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo-(4,3-α)quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) (106, 164, 429). In the rat small intestine, sGC (β-subunit) is highly expressed in ICC-DMP and colocalized with type 1 cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-1) (324). NO synthase (NOS)-immunoreactive neurons were found adjacent to ICC-DMP. cGK-1 expression was also resolved in smooth muscle cells, but very low levels of sGC-like immunoreactivity were found restricted to the innermost layer of circular muscle cells. Expression of sGC (α- and β-subunits probed) is also found in interstitial cells throughout the guinea pig GI tract (175, 176). Both ICC-IM and PDGFRα+ cells express these proteins. Expression of sGC-β in ICC-IM and PDGFRα+ cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. NOS neurons were in close association with cells expressing sGC. As in the rat, smooth muscle cells show little or no immunoreactivity for sGC. This observation was controlled by clear expression of sGC in smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae and in blood vessels, confirming that the techniques used were capable of detecting sGC in smooth muscle cells. These authors concluded that sGC expression is low in smooth muscle cells in the tunica muscularis. Functional immunohistochemical studies showed that stimulation of nitergic neurons in GI muscle strips or treatment with NO donors enhanced cGMP in ICC (348, 431).\n\nDuring muscarinic stimulation, PKC isozymes are translocated from the cytoplasm to the membrane to elicit responses. PKCϵ is expressed in the intramuscular ICC of the murine small intestine (ICC-DMP), and immunohistochemistry was performed before and after muscarinic stimulation of small intestinal muscles (398). The antibody chosen for these studies did not recognize cytoplasmic PKCϵ, but after exposure to ACh or electrical field stimulation of intrinsic motor neurons, PKCϵ was detected in ICC-DMP. Translocation was verified by showing a shift in PKCϵ from the soluble to the particulate fractions of extracts of intestinal muscles. Translocation of PKCϵ was also initiated by phorbol ester, and muscarinic responses and neurally evoked translocation were blocked by atropine or TTX. These experiments directly demonstrated innervation of ICC-DMP by cholinergic neurons.\n\nICC-DMP also express neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors (127, 178, 357, 361), and binding of agonists to these receptors on ICC causes internalization (237). NK1 antibodies were used to test whether membrane internalization could be elicited by stimulation of enteric motor neurons (178). Excitatory motor neurons, which release both ACh and tachykinins in the GI tract, were shown to be closely associated with ICC-DMP expressing NK1 receptors. Stimulation of muscle strips with either exogenous substance P or by electrical field stimulation led to a shift from diffuse immunolabeling of NK1 receptors around the periphery of cells before stimulation to small granular structures within cells after stimulation. Internalization of NK1 receptors in response to field stimulation was blocked by a selective NK1 antagonist ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"WIN62577\",\"term_id\":\"2516442487\",\"term_text\":\"WIN62577\"}}WIN62577) or TTX.\n\nInternalization of NK1 receptors was also exploited as a means to separate ICC-DMP from ICC-MY in the small intestine. Muscles were incubated with substance P labeled with Oregon green (OG-488) before dispersing cells. Cells were sorted for c-Kit and then again for Oregon green. Cells with both labels were considered to be ICC-DMP, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. The cells were probed for numerous genes known to be involved in mediation of postjunctional responses to enteric motor neurotransmitters. Genes including Chm2 and Chm3 (cholinergic responses), Tacr1 (neurokinin responses), Gucy1a3 and Gucy1b3 (nitergic responses), P2ry1 and P2ry4 (purinergic responses), and Vipr2 (responses to vasoactive intestinal peptide) were expressed by ICC-DMP. Further work is necessary to determine whether receptor expression by intramuscular ICC in various regions of the GI tract is linked to ion channels and other effectors that contribute to motor nerve responses.\n\nACh released from motor neurons in the gastric fundus activates different postjunctional mechanisms than are activated by muscarinic agonists added to solutions bathing muscles (33). In this study phosphoproteins involved in Ca2+ sensitization mechanisms were analyzed before and after addition of carbachol to bathing solutions or after stimulation of cholinergic motor neurons. Neural release of ACh activated only phosphorylaton of protein kinase C (PKC)-potentiated phosphatase inhibitor protein (CPI-17), but bath application of carbachol activated phosphorylation of CPI-17 and myosin ph"
