        "text": "I was not impressed by GMG's inital efforts replacing Saga in Glasgow but some months later it's improving greatly and will probably cause greater suffering to Clyde 2 as it continues to develop.\n\nBreakfast with John McCauley is good and he sounds like he is enjoying himself and is making a huge effort. I am not sure about his 'sidekick' who umms and arrs a lot but I like the banter with the travel and news team and the quickfire audience participation on the phone.\n\nMark Goodier does what he does well. It's a networked show and fills time OK but thats about it.\n\nDave Marshall on afternoons is good but perhaps he needs some more freedom to do some interviews as they were a great listen on Saga and Smooth could exploit Dave more than as a DJ.\n\nDougie Jackson is the square peg in a round hole. He does not fit the format and sounds like a Clyde 1 clone or Real DJ in the wrong place. His style is too fast and simply sounds too young for the station.\n\nNights are good with presentation until 12 then non-stop classics.\n\nIt's been good to hear Bill Black back doing country and Alex Dickson reviewing the books. The playlist has also been vastly improved and features and news seem more polished.\n\nIt got off to a shaky start and has some way to go but Smooth is sounding stronger and more appealing now.\n\n0"
