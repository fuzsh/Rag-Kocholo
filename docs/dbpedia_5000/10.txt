Some of Scotland’s most famous radio presenters, including Des Clarke and Robin Galloway could be among 100 or so staff made redundant.

One senior politician described it as “dreadful news” for radio listeners in Scotland.

The three stations, all owned by Global, will now only broadcast local drivetime shows, local news, and local adverts.

The change is part of an attempt by the company to try and compete with BBC Radio 1 and 2.

According to Radio Today, Capital will go first with the London output replacing 14 breakfast programmes on the Capital network in England, Scotland and Wales on April 8. It’s unclear what this means for Scottish hosts Clarke, Amy Irons and Steven Mill.

John McCauley’s (pictured) breakfast show on Smooth Radio will be replaced by a new UK wide breakfast show later in the year, as will Galloway and Adele Cunningham’s programme on Heart.

Global’s founder and executive president Ashley Tabor made the announcement to staff on Tuesday morning. He also revealed plans reduce the firm’s number of “broadcast centres” from 24 down to 14 – though the Glasgow site is set to be spared.

He told RadioToday the changes were a result of the broadcasting regulator loosening rules over local radio.

The SNP MP Joan McAlpine called for broadcast licensing to be devolved: “This is dreadful news for staff members and their families but also for radio listeners in Scotland.

“Many people including myself have warned against the increasing centralisation in London of commercial radio. Ten years ago we had much more local radio content which supported jobs in the creative industries and helped young bands as well. When local licenses were taken over by UK-wide companies, we were told we would still have outputs relevant to Scotland, and our communities. It’s clear these promises have been ditched.”
