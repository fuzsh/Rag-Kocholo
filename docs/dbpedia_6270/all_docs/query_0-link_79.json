Once Greg is introduced to Pam's parents, however, things slide steadily downhill. Pam's dad, Jack, takes an instant and obvious dislike to Greg, remarking constantly about the fact that he is a male nurse. The weekend goes from bad to worse when Greg manages to, almost, destroy the house and the wedding."
