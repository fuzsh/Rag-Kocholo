Because every chapter explores a spectrum of particularly significant motion pictures and the broad range of historical events in one year, readers will gain a continuing sense of the decade as it came to be depicted on movie screens across the continent. The integration of historical and cultural events with the sprawling progression of American cinema illuminates the pervasive themes and the essential movies that define an era. Our series represents one among many possible ways of confronting the past; we hope that these books will offer a better understanding of the connections between American culture and film history.

Before the arrival of that millennium, Kubrick’s film described an epic space journey that begins with the prehistoric discovery of crude weapons that would develop and drive human history through many centuries of exploration and conquest. Linking the past and future with a famous match-on-action edit that transforms a prehistoric club into a sleek twenty-first-century space ship, the film tells the tale of an intergalactic quest for a mysterious monolith, a quest that concludes when the ship and its astronauts become waylaid by an animated computer gone bad and bent on destroying the human crew. 2001 concludes with the image of an embryo floating in space, announcing an ambiguous new age about to be born out of cycles of intellectual discovery and human brutality. When that year 2001 actually arrived, a different apocalyptic violence stunned the world as al-Qaeda terrorists crashed two hijacked jet airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City. As a darkly ironic reminder of Kubrick’s film, witnesses of those shocking images, either on the streets of Lower Manhattan or as television viewers around the world, stated that the crash of the airliners and the crumbling of the towers was “like a movie.” Reflecting this uneasy and uncanny merging of film history and historical catastrophe, the first decade of the 2000s became defined by revolutions of seen and unseen violence, of astonishing and threatening technologies, of cultural and political conquests and reversals, and of a wavering humanity within inhumane worlds. In this decade, new communicative technologies, from Internet news to cell phone tweets, moved more rapidly than ever, almost with a life of their own. In this decade, new speeds drove a cultural and political impatience that continually demands cycles of change that hardly progress. In this decade, American films and film genres, like 2001 as 2001, cyclically and centrifugally intersected with social and political worlds, giving birth to new visions, invariably stretching the terms and borders of reality, realism, and the definition of the human. 1\n\n2\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nIn virtually every cultural and social arena, the decade appeared as a turbulent series of rapid movements and turnabouts. The population of the United States reached 300 million, taking only forty-two years to gain 100 million people since reaching a population of 200 million in 1964. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States quickly became embroiled in two wars that spanned the remainder of the decade—one in Iraq and another in Afghanistan. Even the natural world erupted on 29 August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and exposed the failures of the U.S. government to protect its own natural borders with the speed with which it cavalierly entered those two wars. As a result, over 1,300 people perished from Alabama to Louisiana, sparking heated debates about the shadow of racism in that slow federal response. Meanwhile, an escalating and often bitter debate about another kind of putative racism swept across the nation as it confronted a tide of illegal immigration and a troubled immigration policy. In 2008–2009 a massive global recession, generated by unregulated banking practices, brought the U.S. economy to its knees, while a “Green Revolution,” promoting conservation practices in daily life and public policies to wean America from the soaring costs of oil extracted from the war-torn Middle East, gained momentum. Responding to the ubiquity of the Internet and the apparent triumph of the digital revolution, media culture embraced a widespread fascination with YouTube, 3D movies, Blu-ray discs, and video-on-demand via the Internet. In the midst of fast-paced turbulence and change, the election of the first African American president in November 2008 stood out for many as the most remarkable and dramatic event of a new millennium, inspiring many with an exuberant energy that a year later would stagnate in old political cycles. If the first decade of the twenty-first century seemed continually and quickly to expand through the promise of the virtual, those virtualities again and again ran hard up against the resistant realities they often seemed to control and reshape. Indeed, a tragic emblem of the decade might be the shocking disaster of the space shuttle Columbia on 1 February 2003 during the 113th mission in a visionary program to explore outer space: it ended with the disintegration of the shuttle as it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nPolitics and Culture\n\nFew decades in the twentieth century match the cultural turbulence and tensions of the first decade of the twenty-first, a decade\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nthat was alternately sensationally progressive and sensationally regressive. Media communications proliferated rapidly and broadly through a cultural landscape that seemed to become at once more public and more private, with television programming adapting to these new technologies in a manner that movies seemed slow to respond to. Media sports figures became a key barometer and metaphor for a decade that fluctuated between heroic rises and ignominious falls. And a political stage, framed by two wars in the Middle East, appeared at once invigorated by new promises and possibilities and frustrated by fears and confusions. As new realities (often through new media) opened in all these cultural arenas, the decade became one of surprise, scandal, and shock. If one individual epitomized this decade of cultural backlash, it might be Michael Jackson and his sudden death on 25 June 2009, just as the notoriously public private pop star appeared on the verge of a comeback tour that ended mysteriously in a drug-related death. At the peak of popularity, professional sports likewise discovered that remarkable achievements can be darkly overshadowed by scandals. American Lance Armstrong dominated world cycling, winning the Tour de France for the seventh consecutive time in 2005 while responding to suspicion of drug use or “doping,” charges that are proven in another case when American Floyd Landis is stripped of his victory in 2006. Steroids also stained the glamour and myths of professional baseball. On 13 December 2007, the Mitchell Report on the Steroids Scandal appeared, detailing a year-long investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs over a two-decade period. The report named nearly ninety professional baseball players and urged more careful and regular testing to correct a problem that threatened the integrity of the national pastime and cast suspicion on superstar Barry Bonds’s surpassing of Hank Aaron’s home run record the year before. Perhaps the most renowned and accomplished sports figure of the 2000s, Tiger Woods, became the first golfer to win all four major golf titles in a calendar year when he claimed the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia, in April 2001; during the decade he would win fourteen major golf championships and be named PGA Player of the Year an unprecedented ten times. By the end of the decade Forbes magazine had designated him the richest sportsman in the world. Then, in December 2009, Woods suddenly announced that he would take an indefinite leave from professional golf in the wake of scandalous revelations about his sexual infidelity and promiscuity. Media and digital coverage and cultures moved faster than ever through these public and private domains, offering a technological interactivity with\n\n4\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nthe public and transforming especially the worlds of video games, music, and the broader social networks. With a significant impact on film topics and forms, video games offered tactile and bodily participation for a growing culture of gamers: Halo, released in 2001, promoted its dramatic format of “first-person shooters”; Guitar Hero, released in 2005, allowed players to physically simulate musical performances; and Wii, released in 2006, introduced 3D interaction between player and screen. Similar revolutions markedthe music industry. In February 2006, the one billionth song was downloaded from iTunes, Apple’s Internet music store, as part of a pronounced shift of the industry toward new platforms and away from brick-and-mortar chain stores. Between June 1999 and July 2001, Shawn Fanning’s Napster site allowed individuals to share MP3 music files without fees and without regard to traditional copyright laws. In October 2007 the alternative rock band Radiohead rattled the music industry by releasing their latest CD, In Rainbows, on their website, with customers paying only what they felt was appropriate. Informing all these changes, cell phones and the spread of wireless Internet provided ubiquitous activities for almost all age groups and economic backgrounds; Blackberries, iPhones, and their imitators offered constant access to games, information, and conversations so that private life seemed fully wired into a dynamic public sphere. These new satellite networks became platforms for, perhaps most famously, two new social networks: Facebook, launched in 2004 and by the end of the decade supporting over 500 million subscribers sharing photos, information, and chat online; and Twitter, introduced in July 2006, which opened individual lives to a vast public circuit of interactive communication. More so than movies, television programs during the decade responded to this rapidly changing media landscape with metaphoric and real interactivities that engaged viewers in complex serializations of contemporary realities and reality contests that nervously and dangerously muddled private and public lives. Fast-paced dramas dominated the decade, alongside gritty soap operas stretched to include more violence and sex as part of their family melodramas. One of the most popular of these series, “CSI” (Crime Scene Investigation), spanned the entire decade and became a flexible formula for spinoffs of other crime scene investigation shows, such as “CSI: Miami.” In 2002, “Sex and the City” began chronicling the urban adventures of a group of professional women whose lives are entwined with simultaneously intimate and open sexual activity. Debuting in 2001, “24” followed its hero, Jack Bauer, through the minute-by-minute suspense and danger of a government counterterrorism unit, in which the contemporary anxiety\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nof different terrorist threats leads to testing the moral and juridical limits of Bauer’s (and the U.S. government’s) interrogation and retaliation tactics. “The Sopranos,” one of most critically acclaimed television series of the decade, running from 1999 to 2007, might be described as an allegory for the intriguingly dangerous seepages between private and public life, as mobster Tony Soprano struggles to balance the two worlds of criminal and domestic living. Equally popular through the decade, two reality shows turned this troubling interface into games in which audiences actively participated as viewers and voters: based on foreign versions of the show, “Survivor” transported groups of individuals to exotic locations around the world where they competed as “tribes” facing various physical challenges, while “American Idol” made that test of survival explicitly an entertainment challenge to discover which man or woman from the streets can win enough votes from audiences and judges to be declared the latest singing star of the media. The central cultural drama of this decade, however, was decidedly political, full of cycles and reversals that blurred the lines between global, national, and local politics. Politically, local politics became, more often than not, inseparable from world politics in an age of ubiquitous satellite communication and continual Internet chat. The results were seen in the rapid notoriety of, among other events, the U.S. soldiers who tortured prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq, the war and genocide in Darfur, the terrorist bombings in Madrid and London, and the viral emergence of a Tea Party revolution. Perhaps no film better sketches these swift political movements and global overlappings than Syriana (2005), in which a CIA agent wanders through violence and subterfuge spread from Iran, China, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, a dizzying network of greed and betrayal connected primarily by oil and its pipelines. In this decade, the dominant drama revolved around the violence of territorial invasion and conquest, propelled by the “shock and awe” strategies associated with the U.S. invasion of Iraq and glamorized through the new technologies of that war. The single event that would resonate throughout the decade and beyond was of course the al-Qaeda attacks on 11 September 2001, when fundamentalist terrorists, under the command of Osama bin Laden, hijacked four U.S. airliners and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center in New York City and one into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. A fourth plane was brought down by a passenger rebellion and plunged into a cornfield in Pennsylvania, presumably preventing the destruction of the White House or the U.S. Capitol. In all, nearly 3,000 people were killed.\n\n6\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nIn response to the tragic attack, a month later the United States invaded Afghanistan and the strongholds of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, the start of a war that would continue through the decade and depend increasingly on futuristic unmanned drone attacks. At the same time, President George W. Bush turned most of his attention to Iraq and that country’s resistance to United Nation teams inspecting sites that were presumed to be hiding chemical and biological “weapons of mass destruction.” On 19 March 2003, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began, featuring a coalition of international forces whose attacks as they appeared on television screens seemed to transform the carnage into an eerie video game. This was the second U.S. war in Iraq in as many decades, in this case leading to the capture and execution of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, yet never discovering the supposed weapons of mass destruction that were used to justify the invasion. On 3 February 2004, the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged that the imminent threat from weapons of mass destruction had never been actually verified. National politics framed these violent upheavals with three presidential elections in the decade, permeated with political intrigue, social polarization, and quick power shifts. In one of the most controversial elections in American history, Texas governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore remained in a virtual dead-heat for the presidency more than a month following Election Day. A disputed vote in Florida—made more controversial because of poorly constructed punch ballots—was the key to victory, with Bush leading by a few hundred votes as a recount progressed until a sharply divided Supreme Court halted the recount in favor of Bush. Four years later, Bush won reelection over Massachusetts senator John Kerry with only 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 286 votes in the Electoral College. In the third presidential election of the decade, in 2008, Democratic senator Barack Obama of Illinois easily defeated Republican senator John McCain of Arizona to become the nation’s first African American president, carried into office by his message to enact major cultural and political changes and the promise of national health care reform. Most notable among political newcomers of the year was McCain’s running mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Though she would resign as governor in 2009 midway through her first term, she would become a national leader of the grassroots Tea Party, a loose coalition of conservatives intent on shrinking the size of government. Among other political breakthroughs for individual women in the decade, Hillary Rodham Clinton was elected to the U.S. Senate from New York in 2000, the first time a First Lady had won public office; after a hard-fought run for the Democratic nomination against Obama in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\n2008, she became the new president’s secretary of state. And following the Democrats’ takeover of Congress in 2006, Nancy Pelosi became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House. By the end of 2009 this turbulent back and forth had become concentrated on the American economy. Entering the decade with a large economic surplus, the U.S. government ten years later was mired in a crippling recession, triggered by a massive bank and housing crisis and two ongoing wars. Besides the extraordinary military costs, two related events created the economic crisis: the subprime mortgage collapse of 2007–08, in which excessive and unregulated lending by banks resulted in a shortage of monetary funds and a wave of home foreclosures, and the subsequent government bailout of large banks and other large corporations labeled “too big to fail.” On 3 October 2008, the Congress and President Bush passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which provideda $700 billion bailout for Wall Street firms. As oil prices rose above $140 per barrel, this financial turmoil expanded into a global economic recession that many would compare to the Great Depression of the 1930s. By 2009, China would replace the United States as the world’s largest economic power, and the U.S. jobless rate hovered near 10 percent, with a $10 trillion deficit projected over the next decade.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nThe Movie Industry in the 2000s: Distribution, Revenues, and VOD\n\nLike other areas of popular culture, the movies would act out their own rapid shifts and changes of directions. As the movie industry entered its third century, movements between old and new realities and between consistency and change informed especially the institutional forces behind the movies as they adjusted to increasingly expanding markets and more actively discriminating viewers. Just as it had continually evolved since the 1920s, the Hollywood studio system—specifically the reconfigured Big Six of Warner Bros., Paramount, Twentieth Century–Fox, Universal, Columbia, and Disney—remained more or less intact, yet structural changes and mergers reshaped those studios as they shifted focus from inhouse production of movies to distribution.1 With MGM now considered a “mini-major” supported in part by the Sony Corporation, the large studios for the most part became backers and distributors of films with independent companies actually handling production. Most traditional studios continued to do a modicum of production, but their work began to focus increasingly on development, financing, marketing, and merchandising. At the same\n\n8\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\ntime, each studio more aggressively developed its subsidiary distribution networks (such as Fox Searchlight) to address the diversification of audiences and interests in so-called art house and independent films. These specialty divisions often simply acquired distribution rights to pictures with which the studio had no involvement in production, and the largest part of film production was shipped to other branches of the studios, such as Disney’s Pixar (acquired in 2006) and Warner Bros.’ New Line Cinema (bought in 2008). Meanwhile, the independent production and distribution companies that emerged and flourished in the 1990s prospered and grew as the main sources for quality film production and distribution in the United States. These new independent companies—Lionsgate, Summit Entertainment, The Weinstein Company, Overture Films, and others—are often referred to as “mini-majors,” and through the course of the decade they successfully competed with the traditional studios in film production and distribution, creating what Thomas Schatz refers to in this volume as “mid-range” companies whose films straddle the gap between art films and big-budget movies. Originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, for instance, Lionsgate Entertainment moved in 2006 to Santa Monica, California. Founded as an independent production and overseas sales company in 1996, Summit Entertainment became a studio ten years later, with its first major success, Twilight, appearing in 2008 and its first Oscar-winning production, The Hurt Locker, released a year later. After their departure from Disney’s Miramax, Harvey and Bob Weinstein resurfaced in The Weinstein Company in late 2005, and continued their long relationship with Quentin Tarantino with Inglourious Basterds in August 2009. Overture Films arrived in the fall of 2006, becoming by 2009 one of the most successful studios in the United States. In 1994 Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen created DreamWorks SKG, and by the early 2000s it was one of the most renowned success stories of the decade, sometimes described as the seventh major studio. Across these industrial gyrations, the movie industry vacillated financially throughout the decade, possibly as a result of the weak quality of the films being produced but certainly as a result of expanding competition from other media and the Internet. Attendance at movie theaters grew anemically, with what may have seemed a promising 8.1 percent jump from 2000 to 2004 (attendance was actually down in three of those five years; the figure may simply reflect the sharp increase in attendance in 2002 with the release of Spider-Man and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones) but slowing considerably in the second half of the decade. By the middle years, the num-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nber of moviegoers dropped steadily, falling 4 percent in 2003, 2 percent in 2004, and 8 percent in 2005. Yet by 2008, Hollywood’s six majors recorded significant profits, grossing $9.8 billion domestically and $28.1 billion globally, buoyed in part by higher ticket prices and DVD sales. Fueling the changing economics of the movie industry, the widespread impact of digital technology became a central issue in the decade, transforming not only how movies were made but, more important, how films were delivered to audiences. There is no doubt that digital cameras and editing systems dramatically altered, both financially and stylistically, the ease and costs of making films, but the most revolutionary new directions appeared in how movies began to be viewed and shared as computer downloads, on smaller screens, and according to the demands and choices of individuals. Thus, the convergence of many technological and industrial innovations reshaped movie viewing through the decade—from iPods to video-on-demand—and dramatized the centrifugal spin of the movies as they circulated through different venues and platforms and more active consumer choices (commonly called “agency”) about how, where, and when movies are watched. The traditional theatrical distribution of movies became primarily a way to generate buzz in the promotion of DVD or on-demand sales. Through the course of the decade, Americans spent approximately eighty hours each year watching DVDs as sales and rentals of DVDs soared, exceeding approximately $20 billion a year, far surpassing the declining market for VHS cassettes and making DVD distribution the largest source of revenue for the studios. This foreshadowed a later battle of formats between high-definition DVD and Blu-ray, each claiming to offer higher resolution that could compete with the large theatrical screen. Designed by Sony and first released on 20 June 2006, Blu-ray exceeded the standard DVD in quality with a highdefinition image and sound. Toshiba subsequently developed HD-DVD (three months ahead of schedule) but in February 2008 bowed out of the battle with Blu-ray after most of the major content providers chose Blu-ray. (During these battles and transitions, however, the economics and technologies of standard DVD would remain a prominent force through the end of the decade.) One side effect of the economic shift to DVD occurred in 2007 when the Writers Guild of America demanded financial residuals from DVD sales, as well as compensation for animation programs, reality shows, and new media. More than 12,000 writers participated in a strike that lasted from 5 November 2007 to 12 February 2008, and its complaints and goals brought into high relief the changes taking place across the American\n\n10\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nmovie industry. In the Writers Guild’s demand for fair compensation for work distributed through new media, the transition from theatrical to DVD distribution was only a part of larger shifts whereby the distribution of movies would expand into Internet downloads, streaming, smart phone programming, cable and satellite video-on-demand, and other new methods. Three of the most visible representatives of these technological and commercial changes were Netflix, YouTube, and video-on-demand (VOD). Established in 1997, Netflix created an enormously profitable paradigm for the distribution of DVDs through postal (and later digital) delivery, immediately making over 100,000 film titles available and quickly enlisting approximately ten million subscribers. By February 2007, Netflix had delivered over one billion films through mail subscriptions, and two years later it had doubled that number. In some ways a more radical redirection of movie culture and the potential for digital distribution was the arrival of YouTube in 2005 (purchased by Google in 2006 for $1.65 billion), a videosharing website through which users can upload and share videos as an MPEG-4 format. While most of the content on YouTube originally featured individual personal videos, media conglomerates begin to take more and more advantage of this rapidly growing distribution site through the 2000s, making both clips of their films and often entire films easily available. A significant part of this expansion was realized through the iPod and iTunes, with Apple making deals with film and television networks and production houses such as Pixar to distribute both short and full-length films. Through an updated version of QuickTime Pro, users were soon able to create their own videos for the iPod and rent selected movie titles in HD from their computers. By the end of the decade, this confluence of forces had drawn more and more attention to video-on-demand as a new force in the remaking of movie distribution. With VOD, the window between theatrical release and availability on cable television or Internet collapsed even further. At least in part as a consequence of the dramatic shift to DVD, homedelivery platforms, and Internet access, a major debate in the film industry focused on the timing of a movie’s release on DVD. One of the most publicized experiments of the DVD revolution was “day-and-date release.” With producers Mark Cuban and Tedd Wagner of HDNet Films and 2929 Entertainment, Steven Soderbergh distributed his 2006 film Bubble, about a slacker working in a doll factory, across three different venues: theatrical release followed four days later by its appearance on HDNet cable and in stores on DVD.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\n11\n\nThe Movies: Genres and Trends\n\nThe cycles, expansions, and reversals in American culture were quite visible in movie genres, where they absorbed and reworked the new violence, social realities, and image technologies that informed the larger cultural and social movements of the new millennium. Just as Kubrick’s 2001 turned the conventional science-fiction film inside-out to explore where new historical pressures and technologies of conquest stretch the rituals of genre, film genres of the 2000s pushed their formulas to question what it means to be human and where the answer to that question can be discovered in lost histories and narratives of women and men. From The Lord of the Rings films (2001, 2002, 2003) through Pirates of the Caribbean movies (2003, 2006, 2007), the blockbuster, that most contemporary of film practices and arguably a genre in itself, extended itself through international serials threatened by super-villains and monsters. The musical returned in films like Chicago (2002) and Dreamgirls (2006); westerns took new unexpected twists along the generic borderlines of There Will Be Blood (2007) and No Country for Old Men (2007); old mysteries puzzled out new stories and new behaviors in the complex interactive narratives of Donnie Darko (2001) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004); and, in films from Hulk (2003) to Avatar (2009), the human itself was fantastically transformed in animated features, comic book adaptations, and 3D technologies.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, Focus Features, 2004) is one of the most successful and engaging examples of a potentially new film genre, “smart” or “puzzle” films. Digital frame enlargement.\n\n12\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nAs in earlier decades, blockbuster productions drove American cinema, now more than ever spread across serials and sequels and through international financing and audiences. Two of the most successful elicited traditional American anglophilia and the contemporary upswing in film adaptations of literature: the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series. Based on the novels by British writer J. K. Rowling, the first five Harry Potter films became the highest grossing film series of all time when not adjusted for inflation, with $4.48 billion in worldwide receipts (since then overtaken by the James Bond series). The sixth film appeared in 2009; the seventh and final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, would appear in two parts in 2010–2011. The series depicted the coming of age of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and is sent to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his magical education. At the school Harry becomes part of a community of young wizards, most centrally Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Based on the three-volume series by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) created astonishing semi-human figures wandering a layered world in a battle between good and evil. Set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth and directed by Peter Jackson, the three films follow the young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and his comrades embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring and its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, who are ultimately victorious in the War of the Ring. Distributed by New Line Cinema, the three films became the eighth, fourth, and second highest-grossing films of all time, respectively. Two other blockbuster series stood out in the decade, both suggesting cinema’s near obsession with fantasies of overcoming evil and the power of these fantasies to extend themselves into other cultural spheres. The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, based on a Disneyland theme park ride of the same name, follows the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) through The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), Dead Man’s Chest (2006), and At World’s End (2007). Altogether the three films grossed over $2.79 billion worldwide. The Matrix was a trio of cyberspace adventure films written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, with two sequels appearing in this decade, The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). More so than most contemporary blockbusters, The Matrix films became an\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nexample of significant shifts and expansions in media culture of the new millennium and an instance of what Henry Jenkins has described as “convergence culture,” whereby the characters and settings become part of an expanding fictional universe that is re-created in literary stories, comics, video games, websites, and blogs. Finally, in an appropriate example of the progressive regressions of the decade, the James Bond film series, one of the most popular action series that began in 1962 with Dr. No, was renewed with Casino Royale (2006), becoming the highest-grossing Bond film with a total of $594 million in receipts. With this series and film, movie history again demonstrates that the present and future are often a backward movement to earlier stories and genres, especially in this decade. Films continued to explore certain traditional genres, but the historical revisions that have always followed genres now tend to re-create those genres in more concentrated ways or to discover the repressed or marginalized figures of those genres. One of the most controversial films of the decade was Mel Gibson’s Passion play The Passion of the Christ (2004). Based on the New Testament accounts of the arrest, trial, torture, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus, the film featured dialogue in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew (along with subtitles). The film quickly drew charges of antisemitism while also becoming the highest grossing non–English-language film ever and the most widely seen R-rated film in the United States. A very different sort of genre-bending film, Ang Lee’s award-winning Brokeback Mountain (2005), described the complex romantic and sexual relationship between two seemingly heterosexual men in the American West between 1963 and 1981. Starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the film merged the domestic melodrama and the western to create a powerful drama of gay men struggling to express their love for each other within traditional social and cultural boundaries. The decade also marked the continuing triumph of Martin Scorsese in exploring and twisting genres: the epic tale of New York in the nineteenth century, Gangs of New York (2002), the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator (2004), the crime film about corruption in the Boston police force, The Departed (2006), and the rockumentary of a Rolling Stones’ concert, Shine a Light (2008). For these efforts Scorsese won his second Golden Globe for Best Director, a Critic’s Choice Award, his first Director’s Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director. The last was thought to be long overdue, to the extent that some entertainment critics subsequently referred to it as Scorsese’s “Lifetime Achievement” Oscar. A genre that began in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s, the smart or puzzle film, or what Thomas Elsaesser has described as “mind-game”\n\n14\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nfilms, included movies such as Christopher Nolan’s Memento (2000), Richard Kelly’s Donnie Darko (2001), David Lynch’s Mulholland Dr. (2001), Robert Altman’s Gosford Park (2001), Spike Jonze’s Adaptation (2002), and Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), the latter two written by Charlie Kaufman. They all share narratives and visual styles that involve the audience in various cognitive and imagistic “games” about what happens and why or, in some cases, about the challenge of distinguishing interior subjective realities from exterior objective realities. Continuing a resurgence begun at the end of the twentieth century, documentaries were more visible and central in this decade than perhaps in any other era in American film history. The reasons for this turn are many, but chief among them was their somewhat surprising financial profitability: twenty-two of the top twenty-five highest-grossing documentaries in film history appeared after 2000. In addition to revenues, other factors contribute to this resurgence: the popularity of reality television, copyright pressures, and the ease and affordability of digital cameras. Not surprisingly, given the bellicose atmosphere of the decade, many of the documentaries focused on various war efforts and related effects: The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara (2003), Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), Why We Fight (2005), The War Tapes (2006), No End in Sight (2007), and Taxi to the Dark Side (2007). Others followed significant shifts in documentary practices to concentrate on the margins or undercurrents of American culture and families as ways to investigate the interaction of a personal point of view and social realities, and to simultaneously stretch the borders of both subjective and objective realities. Some of these documentaries worked within conventional forms and formulas, such as Dogtown and Z Boys (2001), Spellbound (2002), The Weather Underground (2002), Tupac: Resurrection (2003), Super Size Me (2004), Murderball (2005), Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005), Man on Wire (2008), and Food, Inc. (2009). Others experimented with representational instabilities within the documentary forms themselves to raise questions not only about actual individuals and events but also about the difficulty of adequately representing those figures and events. This type of reflexive documentary included Bowling for Columbine (2002), American Splendor (2003), Capturing the Friedmans (2003), Born into Brothels (2004), Grizzly Man (2005), An Inconvenient Truth (2006), The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters (2007), How to Fix the World (2006), and How Little We Know of Our Neighbours (2005). Perhaps the most distinct trend inthe decade’s movieswas the prominence of films fueled by new digital technologies. Two very different\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nexamples at the beginning of the decade, Timecode (2000) and Waking Life (2001), employed digital imagery to, respectively, coordinate the simultaneous actions around a film production office in four quadrants on the screen and create a rambling meditation on art and life through rotoscoped animation. Appropriately, an Academy Awards for the Best Animated Feature was presented for the first time in 2001, won by Shrek, a tale that mixes adult humor and a pop soundtrack, including music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, and the Baha Men. Computer-animated films won that award in six of the following eight years, with Pixar leading the way with wins for Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Ratatouille (2007), and WALL-E (2008). At the end of the decade, the marriage of computers and animation produced the enormous success of Avatar (2009), whose story of corporate exploitation of an alien planet raised questions about what it means to be human in the new territories of the universe and whose 3D technology offered viewers glimpses of a new way of seeing themselves through movies. The fascination with animation moved in another direction as cinematic adaptations turned toward superheroes and super-villains from comic books and graphic novels. Traditional adaptations of novels and plays remained a strong current with films such as Doubt (2008), the cinematic version of a dark drama about a Catholic priest in the 1960s, or The Chronicles of Narnia series (2005–2010), based on the books by C. S. Lewis. Yet the marquee adaptations were less part of a literary tradition than part of a popular culture of video games and comic books. Early in the decade, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) became the first of numerous film re-creations of popular video games, while X-Men (2000), based on the fictional Marvel Comics characters of the same name, began a spate of comic book adaptations. Spider-Man (2002) was the first installment of a series that would include two sequels (2004 and 2007); the first was the third highest-grossing film of 2002 with $822 million worldwide, while the latter surpassed the first with a gross of $891 million. Ang Lee’s Hulk (also known as The Hulk) was a 2003 superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name, and Catwoman (2004) represented a super-villain and love interest of Batman. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan helmed two Batman films, Batman Begins (2005), a return to the series that told the origin of the character, as well as the commercially and critically successful sequel The Dark Knight (2008). Directed by Guillermo del Toro, Hellboy (2004) and Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) were based on the Dark Horse Comics work Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola. Also appearing in 2008, Iron Man’s\n\n16\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nPerhaps the most resonant film of the decade, The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, Warner Bros., 2008) struggles with the morality of good and evil, the technologies that support both in a drama, and politics that negotiate human society in a futuristic present. Digital frame enlargement.\n\nsuperhero was based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and Zack Snyder’s Watchmen (2009), a sci-fi neo-noir film, followed a group of vigilantes amid heightened tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Each of the essays in this collection draws on many of the different industrial, social, and technological pressures of the decade, as well as other historical tendencies and generic trends. Nora Alter highlights several 2000 films that teetered on the brink of social satire, fully engaged with the political and cultural violence that would pervade the decade, from American Psycho and Gladiator to Traffic and Bamboozled, while Linda Ruth Williams points out that, in 2001, displaced war films, like Pearl Harbor and Black Hawk Down, appeared prominently alongside so-called “chick flicks” with alternative comedic fantasies, like Legally Blonde, The Princess Diaries, and Bridget Jones’s Diary. The following year, as Sharon Willis argues about 2002, these genres and trends were persistently and more generally inflected with troubled and fragile identities, often played\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nout in dramas focused on the gender and family crises of failed fathers and “melancholic mothers” in movies such as The Bourne Identity and Catch Me If You Can, The Hours and Far from Heaven. As part of his discussion of 2003, Bob Rehak looks at the “shock and awe” atmosphere that motivated some of the mega-blockbusters of that year, often sharing a vision of “flirting with the powers of God.” Anna Everett surveys 2004 through highly successful and inventive sequels such as The Bourne Supremacy and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, while the year also featured a significant proliferation of political and popular documentaries such as Fahrenheit 9/11, Control Room, and WMD. For Karen Beckman, 2005 continued the decade’s investigation of troubled family melodramas in Junebug and The Squid and the Whale, while Miranda July’s You and Me and Everyone We Know and Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain all constituted a generic remake of contemporary social problem films of the 1930s. As Nigel Morris notes in his essay, the war drama, not surprisingly, assumed a particularly contemporary bent as the decade proceeded in its recovery of the more recent trauma of 9/11 in United 93 and World Trade Center, counterpointed by meditative and retrospective revisions of the genre in Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. In 2007, Dina Smith discusses how comedies surged in the teen farces of Judd Apatow, such as Knocked Up, and in a specific comedic subgenre about bumbling boys and physical humor, as in Superbad. In 2008 Thomas Schatz sees the movie industry reflecting the larger economic crisis of the times in which mega-blockbusters like The Dark Knight represented a generic investment in movies “too big to fail” and films like Slumdog Millionaire blurred the lines between independent production and financial success. For Dana Polan, 2009 described a generic trend that rethinks and remakes questions about identity politics: reconfiguring masculinities as masculine redemptions in movies from The International and The Hangover to The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3; remaking historical personalities to reflect the present in Public Enemies and Taking Woodstock; and transforming identity politics into identity products in films such as Hannah Montana. Kubrick’s 2001 could not have anticipated the complexities of the new American millennium and the all-too-earthly imbroglios of its politics, wars, technologies, and disasters. American movie culture of this decade, however, did seem to recall some of the thematic trajectories of that 1968 film: the cinema moves forward through plots of discovery, through technologies of conquest, through images of expanding worlds, through images of new gender and sexual identities, and through questions about what being human ultimately means.\n\n18\n\nTIMOTHY CORRIGAN\n\nN OT E 1. Only one major studio changed corporate hands during the decade, but that occurred twice: Vivendi acquired Universal in 2000, and in 2004 General Electric took charge of the studio.\n\n2000 Movies, Anti-Climaxes, and Disenchantments NORA ALTER\n\nWhen North Americans awoke on 1 January after a night of partying and celebration to usher in the new millennium, there was an almost audible sigh of relief as they drank their coffee, cleared their foggy (and in some cases pounding) heads, and turned on their computers. Home pages reflecting the accurate date and time opened, records and documents were accessible, the Internet operated smoothly—in short, everything was the same as the day before. The anxiety-producing, long-anticipated supervirus, Y2K, which had threatened to shut down all digital and electronic systems and fling the population back to the Ice Age, had not brought the digital world to a halt. Nor did Millennium apocalyptic predictions that forecast the battle of Armageddon and the end of the world materialize. Instead, the new century appeared to be much like the old one, and the anxieties of dramatic change much overblown. Americans continued to enjoy unprecedented levels of prosperity, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 11,722.98 on 14 January, and the NASDAQ peaking at 5132.52 later in the year. Unemployment was at the all-time low of 4 percent. The United States posted a $237 billion surplus at the end of the fiscal year in September, and “experts” forecast that in the next decade the surplus would reach nearly $5 trillion! There were several significant mega-corporate mergers, including Phillip Morris (Kraft) with Nabisco and the Tribune Company with Times Mirror. Evidence of the expanding purview of the Internet was the purchase of TimeWarner by America Online on 10 January. The launch of the MP3 file format and the popularity of computer games such as Pokemon Stadium, Nintendo, and PlayStation continued to grow as the nature of activities entertainment, and the very concept of leisure, fundamentally changed. However, the hyper-growth in this market placed a palpable stress on cinema that emerges in several films. The events of 1989 that had brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War were 19\n\n20\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nundoubtedly significant. Even more important for the triumphant capitalism of the United States was the dot.com revolution. It seemed that good old-fashioned American ingenuity had once again led the way. Emerging out the slump of the 1980s, the full implementation and integration of a digital way of life helped to reestablish the United States as a world leader in the realm of electronic communication. Technological global dominance combined with the massive wealth produced by the deregulation of the banking and finance industries (that began in the 1980s) promised to ensure a long period of U.S. wealth and prosperity. Yet those not wearing rose-tinted glasses could detect cracks in the system, and a number of movies forecast, in radically different ways, a future when the bubble would burst. This was also the year of several noteworthy lawsuits. While the Internet provided the public with an unprecedented accessibility to information and vast possibilities for downloading amounts of data, including music and films, the legal profession tried to keep up. A whole array of new legislation was drafted to protect the commercial interests of corporations. Metallica, the heavy metal band, filed suit against Napster, virtually shutting it down. Microsoft lost its first of numerous antitrust lawsuits. There was also a series of tobacco lawsuits in Florida, resulting in the tobacco industry’s being ordered to pay $144.8 billion (the largest fine to date) in punitive damages. Early in the year, female employees of the U.S. Information Agency won a $508 million class-action suit against the agency for discrimination. Vermont became the first state in the nation to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. Women and people of color moved into prominent positions: Hillary Rodham Clinton was elected senator from New York, and Ruth J. Simmons was hired by Brown University to serve as the first African American president of an Ivy League university. Incidents such as the outbreak of mad cow disease in England, the discovery of black sludge in the Mississippi River, and studies indicating the melting of the North Pole icecap brought into focus the need for closer scrutiny of agriculture and the environment. Many films affirmed that even in a sea of corruption a grander spirit of idealism would triumph. Yet, for Americans, the single most important political event of the year was the controversial presidential election. It would set the course for the new millennium. Whatever naïveté remained about the fairness of democracy in America was washed away, like a face in the sand at the edge of the ocean, by the Supreme Court when it decided the outcome of this fateful event. For many, a hard, cold cynicism set in, with which mainstream America is still dealing.\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n21\n\nThe first indication that something was awry was when, on election night, the news media first called Florida (a hotly contested swing state commanding twenty-five Electoral College votes) for Vice President Al Gore, and then backtracked and withdrew that projection. The following day, on 8 November, the election still had no clear winner. Gore and Texas governor George W. Bush were neck-and-neck with results in several states deemed too close to call. In addition, overseas ballots had yet to be tallied, and many in Florida were demanding a manual recount. Irregularities were discovered in Miami-Dade County, where misleading ballots confused voters. In addition, punch machines and computerized readers may have missed countless votes due to hanging chads—incompletely punched circles that did not fall away from paper ballots. Thus began a bitter and acrimonious partisan fight over the presidency that was to last thirty-six days, until 13 December, when Gore conceded the day after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Florida Supreme Court to halt the manual recount, leaving in place a margin of 537 votes in favor of Bush. Nationwide, Gore had handily won the popular vote, but Bush had won the Electoral College. The entire process left many disillusioned with the U.S. “democratic” system. The frenzy leading up to the election and its chaotic aftermath occupied the American public’s attention while another consequential incident took place. On 12 October, the USS Cole was attacked in the Port of Aden in Yemen by al-Qaeda suicide bombers. Seventeen U.S. citizens were killed in addition to the two perpetrators. This was but the most brazen of attacks on the United States that year. In January, the U.S. Navy reported the attempted destruction of the USS The Sullivans (the boat with explosives sank before it reached its target due to the weight of the freight it was carrying), and this event was followed by reports of plans to bomb Los Angeles International Airport and a tourist site in Jordan popular with U.S. visitors. Thus, while most Americans were focused on the pitfalls of domestic politics, new forms of systematic warfare were being plotted and executed against the United States. Movies engaged and escaped these tensions in a variety of ways. One of the more successful of films of the year about social and political issues, Erin Brockovich, tells the tale of a woman in a small working-class community who takes on and defeats a large corporation. Along with weather-disaster films such as Maelstrom and Hurricane, The Perfect Storm sketches the apocalyptic undercurrents of the new millennium in a drama about a fishing boat caught in a mammoth storm. Countering these anxieties are an almost unprecedented number of mass-culture entertainments, nostalgic remakes,\n\n22\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nand escapist fare, including Shaft, Mission Impossible II, Scream 3, X-Men, The Patriot, Cast Away, Charlie’s Angels, Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Pokemon the Movie, Digimon, and, yes, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. Even inventive narrative experiments, such as Christopher Nolan’s Memento, seem inflected by cultural anxieties: in Nolan’s film he immerses the viewer in a confused amnesiac world in which time is reversed and history difficult to locate. At the same time, numerous American films continue to resist easy classification and stretch the borders of Hollywood and its genres: the mockumentary Best in Show wittily parodies dog-show culture; High Fidelity explores the world of alternative music through the mid-life crisis of a thirty-year-old slacker; Jim Carrey’s vehicle Me, Myself & Irene follows the madcap adventures of a Rhode Island state trooper with multiple personalities; and in Miss Congeniality Sandra Bullock transforms a romantic comedy into the slapstick performance of an undercover FBI agent awkwardly infiltrating a beauty pageant.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nSuspicions and Prophecies: American Psycho and The Perfect Storm\n\nThe post–Cold War economic success of Wall Street is satirized in Mary Harron’s American Psycho, based on the eponymous 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Supporters of the 2009 bailout of corporations and the continuation of obscene bonuses to bankers and financiers would dislike American Psycho. The film is set in the detached capitalist world of young Wall Street executives. With the Twin Towers looming over Lower Manhattan, the plot centers on twenty-seven-year-old Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who serves as one of many vice presidents at Pierce & Pierce, his father’s corporation. It is not quite clear what Bateman does at his job, as both his office and desk are devoid of any traces of labor. His voiceover, which narrates the film, begins by detailing his age, musclecrunching capabilities, and personal hygiene regime: “In the shower I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.” Bateman meticulously attends to every other aspect of his appearance as well. He is dressed and groomed in the height of 1980s fashion. His apartment follows a similar aesthetic, decorated with the work of postmodernist artists Allan McCollum, Robert Longo, Cindy Sherman, and other leading figures of the 1980s. The furniture is high modernist design. Initially Bateman’s personality seems affable enough, and when we first encounter him\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n23\n\nA pristine and affluent America on the verge of losing control: American Psycho (Mary Harron, Lionsgate). Digital frame enlargement.\n\nin conversation with his cohorts he reprimands them for their antisemitic comments. The film follows a group of young executives as they negotiate the social world of high finance at the height of Reaganomics in late 1980s New York. It is a world of banking deregulations and expanding bubbles, the erosion of social programs and promotion of trickle-down economics— a decade of restructuring that many today hold responsible for enabling the 2008 economic collapse. At one point, Bateman watches the actor-turnedpresident deliver a speech. The young Bateman’s physique, poses, and obsessive body-building evoke Arnold Schwarzenegger, another B-movie actor turned politician in the state of California, where the illusions and dreams spun by Hollywood studios have a tendency to become the nightmare realities of American life. During this sequence we are at once thrust backward into the celluloid past and proleptically forward to a future in which Schwarzenegger becomes governor of California. New York City in the eighties was emerging from bankruptcy; energy (emanating from the financial district) was once again coursing through the city, with the gentrification of SoHo, the proliferation of high-end galleries and boutiques, the popularity of exclusive discos and nightclubs, and plenty of cocaine and martinis. These are the sites frequented by the characters in American Psycho. Indeed, several scenes in the film include trendy restaurants with hyperbolic menus featuring items such as “swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, rare roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale, . . . and grilled free-range rabbit with herbed french fries.” It is a world before cell phones and personal computers, dominated by empty signifiers that connote value but lack any real substance. This is embodied in\n\n24\n\nNORA ALTER\n\na particularly hilarious scene involving business card envy. With deadpan delivery, a group of young executives compare their business cards, sporting background colors with names like “eggshell” or “bone” (in the case of Bateman’s), to fonts such as “Silian Rail” or “Romalian Type.” They are awestruck as they examine Paul Allen’s card (he another vice president at Pierce & Pierce) and are particularly impressed by its watermark. It is a society of spectacle and simulation where the operating law is that of appearance. Thus, the “simulationist” artworks by McCollum hanging on the wall only appear to be paintings—in reality they are plaster casts. The same is true for the characters who lack any depth or development. Bateman adopts the persona of an out-of-control serial killer. Even the detailed musical interpretations he articulates prior to committing his murders ring hollow. His analysis of the music of Phil Collins while engaging in a ménage-à-trois with two prostitutes parodies intellectual criticism: “I think ‘Invisible Touch’ is the group’s undisputed masterpiece. It’s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches . . . the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christie, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing . . . of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.” He executes his murders in a dispassionate and particularly gruesome manner. Even these acts of violence appear to be simulations—derivative of late-night slasher films. Thus in one of the final murders, Bateman chases his victim down a winding stairwell with a battery-operated chainsaw simultaneously evoking the cult-classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Fritz Lang’s M. Like the serial murderer in M, Beckert, Bateman pleads insanity. And like Beckert’s victims in M, Bateman’s are initially those from the lower classes. Indeed, Bateman preys on the homeless, prostitutes, and secretaries before advancing to the next register of the social ladder when he kills one of his peers.1 The interesting twist in American Psycho comes near the end of the film when Bateman tries to confess his crimes to his lawyer. The possibility emerges for the first time in the film that the entire series of murders is his fantasy. Reality is increasingly difficult to discern in Bateman’s nightmarish world. Although he may not have literally committed his crimes, there is certainly a lot of symbolic blood on his hands. For in order to stay the course of ruthless finance capitalism, with the disparities between the rich and the poor reaching unprecedented levels, there have to be many victims. The catastrophic annihilation of social spending together with a perverse array of tax and corporate breaks ensured the return of a mandarin class to\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n25\n\nthe United States. The casualties will be the homeless and the working poor who will only continue to grow in numbers into the new millennium. Just as we follow Bateman’s character on his killing spree, amazed at how long it goes on, so too economists marveled at the financial bubble, watching it continue to expand until finally it began to burst in 2007. The surprise was not that the economy crashed, but that it took so long. And crash it did. A spectacular crash—a crash forecast and magnificently constructed cinematographically in Wolfgang Petersen’s The Perfect Storm. The 130-minute saga chronicles the plight of a group of fishermen at sea who are caught in an enormous storm. It is based on the true story of the Andrea Gail, whose Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney), despite severe weather warnings, set forth in late October 1991 with a crew of five in search of fish off the Massachusetts coast. The audience is told at the outset that the boat will sink with no survivors, but, as in a Greek tragedy, we watch as the drama unfolds, following its narrative detours. The question is not if disaster will strike, but how and when. The similarities between The Perfect Storm and Petersen’s breakthrough film, the German Das Boot (1981), are striking. The theme is once again a group of men alone at sea confronting a ruthless enemy. The only difference is that in the later film nature is the enemy, whereas in the earlier film (set in a U-boat during World War II) it is the British. In both instances, our sympathies are with the crew and the countless perils they face while struggling for their lives. The boats are spaces without women, and initial animosities between crewmembers are overcome by acts of male bonding against a common foe. The resemblance between the two productions reveals Petersen’s talent for formulaic filmmaking.2 The motivating factors that induce the two crews to place themselves in dangerous circumstances have a common root. In the case of Das Boot it is conventional warfare, while for the captain and crew of the Andrea Gail it is economic warfare. The Perfect Storm opens with Tyne returning from a failed fishing expedition. He is rebuked for not delivering a greater yield of swordfish. In contrast, Christina Cotter, the captain of another vessel, is quite successful, adding a gender dynamic to Tyne’s humiliation. Tyne, a white working-class man from the U.S. South, loses his earning power, while a woman whose accent reveals her origins from somewhere in New England forges ahead. (Note that in An American Psycho, set in the mideighties, women do not pose an economic threat for an executive class that protects men with a glass ceiling.) Facing the prospect of a long winter (it is late October) without financial security, Tyne decides to go out to sea once again; this time farther than usual, where the swordfish are reported to be\n\n26\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nIn The Perfect Storm (Wolfgang Petersen, Warner Bros.), the disasters of a group of fishermen on the high seas also suggest an apocalyptic burst of the bubble that has been sustaining the United States for years. Digital frame enlargement.\n\nmore plentiful. This is a particularly risky venture given the storms that move through the area in the late fall. But the prospect of poverty is a powerful motivator and, despite warnings, the crew of the Andrea Gail sets forth. In a parallel side narrative, a man and two women in a leisure yacht are caught in one of the storms off the Florida coast but are successfully rescued by the Coast Guard. However, the Coast Guard is not as lucky, and one of its crew members perishes. In this instance the leisure class trumps the working class. The Andrea Gail’s fate is sealed when three separate severe weather systems come together to produce a “perfect storm,” complete with waves over one hundred fifty feet high. Although the audience knows the outcome, Petersen teases it out. Each adverse encounter and wave is more dangerous than the next. One spectacular feat follows quickly upon another, with an array of sea rescues, including Tyne climbing out onto the fishing spar to solder off the anchor in the midst of high seas and lashing winds. This is not a low-budget film. Petersen filmed many of the scenes during an actual hurricane. The effect of realism is perfectly reproduced in the film right through to the final, ominous wave. The viewer anticipates the wave, much in the same way that the meteorologist in the film who tracks the various storm systems back in the safe haven of a television studio sees the wave coming. But many viewers drew pleasure gauging the ways new digital technologies enhanced and revitalized the disaster film genre, and Petersen demonstrates what the forces of film technology, when expertly executed, can produce: the perfect sensation. As Proximus reminds Maximus in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator: “You can’t just kill, you have to give the audiences a show.” And a spectacular\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n27\n\nshow it is. Facing the enormous, towering, cresting wave, the rather pathetic 72-foot fishing boat meets it head-on. There is no question of survival. The wave, which was constructed in a huge studio tank, takes on the role of a character in and of itself. It will resurface six years later with similar destructive force as a 150-foot rogue wave in Petersen’s Poseidon (2006). The parallel is clear: the economic bubble is a wave that must crash. The question is not if, but when.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nDavid and Goliath: Gladiator and Traffic\n\nIf both An American Psycho and The Perfect Storm leave viewers with a sense of inevitable doom in a world of misplaced values, Gladiator seeks to restore a universal faith in noble virtues, and the belief that good will ultimately triumph over evil. The film is replete with profound and weighty lines, such as “What we do in life echoes in eternity,” or “You wrote to me once, listing the four chief virtues: Wisdom, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance.” In Scott’s Roman Empire, both racial and class barriers can be overturned if the heart is true and a strict code of ethics is followed. Gladiator is a historical epic that rewrites the history of Maximus Decimux Aurelius (Russell Crowe, in his first major role), a Spanish farmer who, because of his bravery and skilled leadership qualities, became a general in the army of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. He represents a simple, earnest character, whose eyes and brow are furrowed and brooding, wearing the pain of injurious deeds committed against the Roman people by nefarious elements in ancient Rome. Gladiator is set around the year 300 (or is it the 1990s in the United States?) and opens during the Danubian Wars against the Germans. Maximus commands the army and secures success for the emperor, who, in turn, decides that Maximus should be his successor. Unfortunately, this means bypassing his own flesh and blood, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The latter, unable to accept Marcus’s wish, slays his father before he has the opportunity to publicly announce his decision, and does what he can to murder Maximus. The heroic general manages to escape, and, near death, is sold into serfdom in North Africa. As a slave he becomes a gladiator and uses his military training to organize an extraordinary group of fighters to skillfully vanquish their combatants. In the meantime, Rome under Commodus’s decadent rule has sunk into a state of debauchery and unscrupulous behavior. The megalomaniacal Commodus attempts to be rid of the Senate and restore absolute rights to the emperor. He pits himself against the political assembly and plots to assassinate the consul elect and proclaim\n\n28\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nhimself ruler. The historical figure of Commodus was so abusive, both personally and politically, that a wrestler eventually assassinated him during his bath. In Scott’s film, Commodus’s death is far nobler and occurs during a final duel between Maximus and the emperor in the public view of the spectators of the Coliseum in Rome. Although mortally wounded beforehand by Commodus, Maximus manages to kill him before expiring. Order is then restored with Marcus’s young grandson proclaimed emperor, under the strict guidance and counsel of the wise senators. Unlike the historical Emperor Diocletian, a peasant who rose to a general’s rank and ultimately became emperor, Scott returns us to a ruling structure predetermined by bloodlines and inheritance. Gladiator is the Horatio Alger myth of ancient time, staged in the birthplace of democracy. Not once but twice must Maximus rise from nothing to establish himself. In the first instance he has to overcome his farmer origins to become a general, whereas in the second round he advances from slave to the triumphant restorer of order to the state. Maximus succeeds, the film implies, because he is true and uncorrupt. He follows a higher ideal, which is to serve humanity. Although he is obviously not Christian, there are several scenes that depict Maximus praying and demonstrating deep reverence to spiritual forces. In the world in which Maximus inhabits there are no prejudices, all slaves are equal, and indeed his closest friend is African. Geographically, the film emphasizes the far reach of the Roman Empire—southward, from Spain to North Africa and the Nubian Desert, and northward up to present-day Germany. It is also an empire riddled with corruption. Although the Senate, embodied by the character of the noble Senator Gracchus, seeks democratic rule, it is weakened and under constant threat by both internal and external elements. Maximus’s higher charge is to empower the noble Senate and render it a legitimate governing branch once again. Gladiator stresses the point that the Senate is entrusted by the people to represent their rights; it is their voice. The social context of impending catastrophe and crisis depicted in Gladiator parallels that of contemporary politics. Government has become mean-spirited in Washington, with rhetorical recklessness and rampant corruption. This condition has been in the making for some time. The Clinton years merely continued the expansion of the number of lobbyists in Washington and the power of specialinterest groups set in motion by the Reagan administration in the 1980s. At base there is something deeply perverse, or deranged, as depicted in American Psycho or in Darren Aronofsky’s tragic Requiem for a Dream, in which the promise of a better future barely survives a summer. In the latter film, the\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n29\n\nhedonism of the American way of life has become fully decadent, and stoned, with pharmaceuticals for the elderly and heroin for the youth. Scott’s Gladiator calls for a return to less selfish ideals and a more just society. Just as ancient Rome is saved from the brink of disaster by the honorable Maximus, the film suggests that something similar could alter the course of destiny in the United States. Sadly, George W. Bush was no such hero, and the next decade made many yearn nostalgically for the nineties. The popularity of gladiator games and the public’s seemingly unquenchable thirst for violence and ever more elaborate bloodbaths serves as a bitter commentary on the power of distraction, the lust for spectacle, and the perversity of real-life politics. Steve Soderbergh’s Traffic is another film in which a network of corruption is dismantled and law and order restored by extraordinary individuals who are beyond blemish. The film takes place in four contemporary locations: San Diego, Cincinnati, Washington, D.C., and Tijuana, Mexico. It consists of three interrelated narratives that are connected through illicit drug trade. Each narrative section is separated from the others through the use of different color film stocks and cameras: for Washington and Cincinnati no filter is used, producing a bluish cast; in San Diego the colors are lusher, and warmer; and in Mexico they bear a brownish hue (a tobacco filter). Each vignette concerns the high-stakes money, violence, and corruption connected to the illegal drug trade. In Tijuana, a police officer by the name of Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) is determined to squelch the drug cartel and restore peace and hope to youth in a city that has been overrun by drug-related crimes. In San Diego, two undercover drug investigators seek to prosecute one of the leading importers and distributors of drugs north of the border. The story in Cincinnati and Washington, D.C., centers on the new head of the DEA, Judge Wakefield (Michael Douglas), whose private-school, honor-roll daughter is addicted to crack cocaine. Rodriguez is successful in his mission. Yet the viewer is left with the feeling that only one head of the hydra has been cut off, with a new one ready to grow in its place. The film underscores that demand drives the drug industry. In San Diego the trafficker is released and rejoins his wife to rebuild their empire. Back on the U.S homefront, Wakefield rescues his daughter from the clutches of an African American pimp who prostitutes her out to older white men. Coincidentally, the trope of the black pimp preying on white, drug-addicted teenage girls recurs in Requiem for a Dream. Whatever such racial stereotyping may mean in these contexts, the two films depart in their conclusions: Requiem ends dismally, while in Traffic the wealth of the girl’s parents allows her to be saved and rehabilitated.\n\n30\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nWhat connects these separate worlds are the drugs that circulate from desperately poor Mexicans to poverty-stricken parts of North American cities to the suburban bathrooms of upper-class American youth. And what makes Traffic most interesting is the manner in which the narrative is told. It is structured as three separate stories, each of which is loosely connected through threads of correspondence related to drugs. Each narrative maintains its own separateness, existing as a monad, and, unlike in a conventional narrative, the characters and stories are never brought together at the end. The narrative is thus less like Charles Dickens’s Tale of Two Cities (1859) than Don DeLillo’s Underworld (1997). The viewer, like the reader, is placed in an omniscient perspective of looking at all the stories, making the connections, and seeing the totality of the network. In Traffic the network is exposed: drug culture is viral. It spreads rhizomatically, immune to borders and boundaries. The spectator is left to connect the dots.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nNarrative Experiments: Timecode and Cecil B. Demented\n\nAlong the same lines as Traffic, Mike Figgis’s Timecode experiments with parallel narrative worlds, albeit with an even more pronounced formal technique—the division of the screen into four discrete boxes. Figgis updates a formal innovation first introduced by Andy Warhol in Chelsea Girls (1966) and later used by Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville in Numero Deux (1975). It was this millennial year, however, that marked a near completion of the digital revolution in film production, with the first film entirely produced on high-definition digital video—Videocoq— completed only months afterward. But until then the procedure was still in the experimental phase. The saturation of media culture by digital production led to the preponderance of split screens, multiple frames, and fragmented viewing experiences that perceptually alter the consumption and processing of information. Digital editing software technically facilitates the use of split screens and the production of simultaneous narrative sequences. Timecode anticipates a new mode of spectatorship, one in which the fundamental montage structure will be organized spatially rather than sequentially—“soft montage,” as Harun Farocki and Kaja Silverman call it in reference to Numero Deux (see Farocki and Silverman). A novel form of cinematic vision emerges in the new millennium, one that is no longer monocular, or even binocular, but rather panoptical (see Crary). Attention is split in Timecode, as four interconnected narratives unfold simultaneously in real time. Tremors from an earthquake that shake the set\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n31\n\nand interrupt all the characters onscreen remind us of the simultaneity of the four scenes. Each of the narratives is shot in videotape in a single ninety-minute take. The tape was later transferred to film for theatrical release, but the original is meant to be screened in its video format. If Numero Deux celebrated the flexibility and degree of experimentation that the relatively new technology of videotape permitted, Timecode, a quarter of a century later, stands as a farewell to that medium as we move beyond the analogue and into the digital age. As in Chelsea Girls, our attention is directed by subtle adjustments in the amplification of the soundtrack. The viewer follows that which s/he hears the clearest: vision follows sound. The directions that accompanied Warhol’s film granted the projectionist the authority to determine the order in which the reels would be screened, thereby making each viewing a unique experience. In the DVD release of Timecode the spectator is provided with a similar power to decide which of the sound tracks of each quadrant to follow. This mode of participation parallels interactive games and hypertexts. Timecode’s underlying narrative is rather banal. Priority has been given to technical innovation, to how the narrative is far more interesting than what it tells. But perhaps that is Figgis’s point—to demonstrate that content no longer matters in the new regime of cinema. Unlike Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950), in which the same story told from multiple perspectives captivates the viewer, in Timecode it is the fact of multiple perspectives, and not the story, that is captivating. It is a self-reflexive narrative about a production company, Red Mullet, which happens also to be Timecode’s production company. The film exposes the behind-the-scenes aspects of making a film, from developing storylines to securing funding, casting actors, and the like. A few romantic affairs and interpersonal tensions are thrown in to heighten the action. Set in Hollywood, the film is about filmmaking and the entertainment industry, a theme that will resurface in several other films of the year. Unlike late-nineteenth-century culture, which greatly anticipated the year 1900 (Sigmund Freud delayed the publication of The Interpretation of Dreams so that it would bear the imprint “1900”), in film culture the year does not appear to have been as significant. This is likely due to the fact that the centenary of cinema was commemorated a mere five years prior in 1995. Yet several significant productions do address the state of the art at the new millennium. In some instances homage is paid to classics, such as E. Elias Merhige’s Shadow of the Vampire, with its imaginary narrative of the making of F. W. Murnau’s Nosferatu (1922). Early on, the character of the leading female star, Greta, complains to director Murnau: “Theater gives me life;\n\n32\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nFilm takes it away!” The comment is telling, for it articulates the anxiety of cinema in the 1920s to find its place among the other more established arts such as theater. Film is vampiric, feeding off other forms; and at the dawn of the new millennium the same anxiety prevails—cinema’s role within the entertainment industry and its various competing offshoots. Ever-so-outrageous director John Waters made sure to start new millennium with a bang with his cinematic missile, Cecil B. Demented. The film explicitly lambastes feel-good, righteous, or stoic characters such as Erin Brockovich, Gladiator’s Maximus, or other affirmative fare produced by Hollywood. The plot involves a group of rogue film students in Baltimore who, led by director Cecil B. Demented, plot to kidnap a popular Hollywood actress, Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith). The terrorist group’s mantra is anti-Hollywood, by which they mean the studio system, high production values, formulaic plots, lack of experimentation, and the incessant generation of affirmative entertainment for passive audiences. Each member of Cecil’s band, from the lighting technician to the makeup artist, the costume designer to the character actors, has tattooed onto his or her body the name of a filmmaker-artist who defied the system to maintain artistic integrity. These great figures include Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Kenneth Anger, Pedro Almodóvar, and Sam Peckinpah. Cecil proudly bears Otto Preminger on his forearm and nightly leads a group prayer to Andy Warhol. Throughout the film, the characters throw out lines championing Underground Cinema, Guerilla Cinema, and Third Cinema. They decry egregious industry practices such as the reshooting of foreign films into English (necessitated because American’s “don’t read subtitles”), and maintain that “family” is just another word for censorship. One particular target is the adaptation of television shows, comics, and interactive games into film. The motley crew of characters blames the fact that they have sold only one ticket to their film on the competition at the local multiplex, The Flintstones 2, which is drawing large audiences. It confirms their belief that audiences seek comfort in the tried and true: that which is most predictable and requires little or no work on the part of the spectator. The same formulaic Taylorist production model that avant-garde auteur Hans Richter summoned when speaking about the film industry of the twenties (he wrote that it churned out patterned productions the way that garment factories mass-produced clothes of various sizes and colors) is still in place nearly a century later (see Richter). Cecil B. Demented’s band of cinematic outsiders stages increasingly violent events in their attempt to disrupt Baltimore’s burgeoning film industry. In the 2000s, Baltimore, like so many formerly industrial cities, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and\n\n2000 — MOVIES, ANTI-CLIMAXES, AND DISENCHANTMENTS\n\n33\n\nProvidence, sought to reinvent itself as a cultural center, hoping for revitalization through culture industry investments. Film was just one of the media touted by the myth of the creative economy. Waters spoofs on these initiatives, including a scene with the mayor of Baltimore welcoming filmmakers to the Eastern Shore and celebrating the making of “Gump Again,” a sequel to Forrest Gump. In one shot, Forrest eats a crab cake (blue crab is a symbol of Baltimore), which he likens to society. In the background we see not the skyline of Baltimore but the Twin Towers of Lower Manhattan, indicating that with green screens any backdrop can be added to a scene. It is precisely this degree of artificiality and manipulation that horrifies the renegade group. Their film, they proclaim, will be based on reality—a reality show. It will be produced outside the scope of a studio and without professional actors (excluding Honey). Reminding the viewer of this “reality” is Patty Hearst, former hostage turned SLA terrorist, who appears in the film as another character’s mother. By the film’s end, Honey will (like Hearst) be converted by those who hold her captive. Akin to those directors worthy of a tattoo, John Waters is a longtime independent filmmaker who has not sold out and has assumed cult status. Cecil B. Demented is his acerbic commentary on the film industry at the turn of the century.\n\n■■■■■■■■■■\n\nSatire: Bamboozled and O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\nOne of the team of advisors in Timecode criticizes the portrayal of a stereotyped black character with the pronouncement that “Black can be multidimensional.” But in order to see that realized in film, we have to turn to Spike Lee’s acerbic Bamboozled. The film has one of the most striking opening lines: against the music and lyrics of Stevie Wonder’s “Misrepresented People,” the protagonist, Pierre Delacroix, enunciates the word “Satire” and proceeds to deliver a series of definitions: “1a. A literary work in which human vice or folly is ridiculed or attacked scornfully.” The definition continues, ending with various synonyms. Bamboozled, then, scathingly critiques American society and its deeply entrenched racist roots. Notably, Lee’s tattoo-worthy status was honored in Cecil B. Demented, where his name was evoked reverentially. The narrative of Bamboozled follows the character of Delacroix, a writer of screenplays for television, a “creative person” who lives in a room in a clock tower in New York City. The huge arms of the clock face can be seen outside his window. He literally lives inside time. The clock is ticking as Delacroix acknowledges the arrival of the twenty-first century, which he\n\n34\n\nNORA ALTER\n\nknows will bring about the termination of television—and thus his lifeline. The impact of developments and inventions in mass entertainment, such as interactive games, on the television network has been too great.3 With the ratings for CSN, the station that employs Delacroix, perilously low, the management concludes that a new program is needed, one that will garner mass appeal and become an overnight success. Delacroix, the one black man on the network team, is charged by his boss to produce a black comedy show. It is made clear that the show should not be about socially integrated and upwardly mobile blacks. The color line has to be clearly demarcated, and innuendos that might confuse an audience and make them think have to be avoided. In order to carry out his new job, Delacroix researches old films and television shows, and Lee splices in archival footage of African Americans entertainers—or, as Henry Louis Gates has it, “signifying monkeys” (see Gates).
