        "text": "Monthly Archives: June 2024\n\nPick your movie of the week: Music Artist Documentaries (July 7-13, 2024)\n\nJoy and I just watched the new Celine Dion documentary, I Am Celine Dion, and we both liked it a lot. I won’t say anything more about it other than it’s streaming on Amazon Prime right now, and that it has inspired this week’s nominees. All of the following are fairly recent documentaries about musical artists. Which one do you prefer, or which would you rather watch if given the chance? Vote with a comment:\n\nCobain: Montage of Heck (2015)\n\nWhat Happened, Miss Simone? (2015)\n\nRemastered: The Two Killings of Sam Cooke (2019)\n\nThe Top 50 Movie Westerns\n\nThe American Film Institute defines the movie western as “a genre of films set in the American West that embodies the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the new frontier.” Sometimes I’m surprised at the titles that get put into this category, and some I just can’t bring myself to do so. But the following are either obvious westerns or ones that I’ve seen/heard brought up enough over the years as part of the genre that I chose to include them.\n\nAs usual, my own bias does affect this list, but I tried to take a more broad viewpoint in the selection and ordering. Movies that are influential or that best embody the genre get an extra boost in the rating.\n\nThe Top 50 Greatest Western Movies\n\nThree Amigos!

So this week’s nominees are movies shot in Edmonton. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every shot was taken there, but a substantial enough amount that Wikipedia places them in this category. Vote for your pick as Movie of the Week by way of comment:\n\nThe Searchers (1956)\n\nThe Edge (1997)\n\nThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)\n\nCategorically Allegorical\n\nIn a blog post a couple of years ago I’d shared some examples of movies that had deeper meaning than what they were about on the surface. Most, of which, were a surprise to me. Films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, X-Men, and Groundhog Day had directors that had something to say or share by way of allegory. Perspective is a powerful tool for growing and gaining understanding, so it’s cool to discover these from time to time, so I’ve decided to share some more. Some of the following aren’t as much as a surprise, but some still may be.\n\nAliens (1986) : The Vietnam war\n\nIn 1979, Ridley Scott’s Alien–as shared in my 2022 post–was an allegory for rape. The 1986 sequel had a different director, \\James Cameron, who saw definite correlations of his story with the Vietnam war. Some of these are 1) the high degree of confidence the US marines had in defeating an enemy that was nowhere near as advanced in technology and warfare, 2) the soldiers traveling a great distance to fight said enemy, 3) the adversary having a better sense of the geography and environment than the attackers, and 4) the Americans end up fleeing for their own lives. However, it could be that it was the war influencing Cameron’s direction more than being an intended allegory. I say this because I really don’t know all the details. Also, I am hoping it was unintentional to depict a nation’s people as slimy, murderous monsters.\n\nThe Babadook (2014) : Mental illness\n\nI’d heard that this was a great horror movie, but I thought that just meant it was scary, had good acting, cool effects, etc. But it was the powerful allegory that made this one great. It has no blood-n-guts nor demonic elements, which may be a relief to some. Horror can be a perfect genre when talking about mental illness. Yet, The Babadook is not merely a movie saying that mental health is scary. It’s a very hopeful movie and I highly recommend it.\n\nGet Out (2017) : The African American experience.\n\nThis one is more well known to be an allegory, because at the time of its release the parallels were discussed at length by moviegoers and movie podcast voices. It really is a remarkable movie, and identifying all of the intended symbols—the ones I caught and the ones I missed—was as rich of an experience as watching the movie itself.\n\nThey Live (1988) : Corruption\n\nYou’ve most likely seen the often referenced shot of Nada finding sunglasses that allows him to see the ugliness of what appeared to be the glamourous people and media that dominated its society. John Carpenter had a very specific policy and platform of a real politician, but the allegory works on just about any vantagepoint of modern society. We often don’t realize how controlled we are by brands and messages, and mostly to our own disservice.\n\nThe Matrix (1999) : The Trans Experience\n\nLilly Wachowski, one of two sisters who made this classic action film, has said that this wasn’t written necessarily as a parable about being a trans person. However, the sisters were closeted trans people at the time of filming, and both their writing and direction of the movie made direct parallels with their experience and perspective.\n\nDistrict 9 (2009) : Refugees\n\nAgain, the symbolism and correlation between the movie and its hidden meaning were hard to miss in 2009, and even more so now. This is one of the hardest subjects for us to talk about today, and most of us do a great job avoiding doing so. The movie doesn’t necessarily offer a solution. Viewers are left to chew on those complicated feelings and thoughts they may have with subjects like immigration, borders, and foreign wars.\n\nFight Club (199) : Consumerism\n\nActually, this movie is an allegory for so much more than this—from capitalism to adolescence to patriarchy. It’s not an easy watch at all, but it is a masterfully made commentary that has made significant contributions to dialogue about our culture.\n\nAnd our movie of the week also has an allegory that is hard to miss, and it’s handled very well. I can’t speak as intelligently to all the connections as a female viewer could, but the message comes across loud and clear. If you haven’t seen it yet, you may want to take it in soon. You can find it on Disney+.\n\nCongratulations Turning Red. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Rosalie Chiang as Meilin in Turning Red\n\nBest Actor: Jim Gaffigan as Lorenzo Paguro in Luca\n\nBest Quote: “Don’t worry, they’re fine. You can’t crush a soul here. That’s what life on Earth is for.” – Tina Fey as 22 in Soul\n\nI wanted to make a top 10 of movies with “red” in the title, or movies set in Toronto, but I was having a hard time with either one. So here’s my last 10 top 10:\n\nScenes from a Marriage (1973) – Ingmar Bergman movie, Sweden ✭✭½\n\nLa Strada (1954) – Black and white Frederico Fellini movie, Italy ✭✭½\n\nBack to Black (2024) – Biopic about Amy Winehouse ✭✭✭½\n\nIf (2024) – John Krasinski, Ryan Reynolds, Cailey Fleming ✭✭✭½\n\nSilence (2016) – Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson ✭✭✭½\n\n21 Jump Street (2012) – Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Holly Robinson, Brie Larson ✭✭✭½\n\nBigger Than Life (1956) – James Mason, Barbara Rush ✭✭✭✭\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024) – Freya Allan, Kevin Durand, Owen Teague, William H. Macy ✭✭✭✭\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) – Anya Taylor Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke ✭✭✭✭\n\nInside Out 2 (2024) – Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri ✭✭✭✭\n\nPick your movie of the week: 20’s Pixar (June 23-29, 2024)\n\nTo me, Inside Out was the best Pixar movie of the last decade. Just last weekend I saw the sequel with Joy, Leah, and Ehsas; and again, for me it is so far the best Pixar of the 20’s. The nominees this week are Pixar movies released in the last 4 years. I enjoyed each of these quite a bit. How about you? Vote for one to be our movie of the week by voting with a comment:\n\nSoul (2020)\n\nLuca (2021)\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nMOVIE QUIZ!

I want to share some of the wackiest ones with you, but first let’s acknowledge big ones. Would this be an accurate top 10 of the most famous and most talked about conspiracy theories?\n\nElvis and/or Hitler still alive\n\nPrincess Diana death planned\n\nClimate change as a hoax\n\nFlat earth\n\nThe Illuminati or New World Order\n\n9/11 as an inside job\n\nMoon landing as a hoax\n\nAliens active on earth (Building the pyramids, Stonehenge, etc.)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nJFK\n\nSome are understandable, other are pure lunacy. But never mind those. Let’s get to the main course: the wild ones that I hadn’t heard about until just recently. Perhaps you have. Either way, read carefully. You never know who’s watching!\n\nPandas aren’t real – Yup. This conspiracy says that pandas couldn’t make it as a species because 1) they’re bad at reproducing, 2) they are clumsy, and 3) they eat nothing but bamboo even though they’re built like carnivores. Therefore, according to believers, they are just people in panda suits putting on a show for us all. There are a lot of pandas in this world, in zoos across the globe and in the wild of China. So, like what is found in a lot of conspiracy theories, this is one very elaborate and expensive hoax to pull off.\n\nEarth is hollow – Scientists had released information about the earth’s make-up in 2014, and in it shared that little is actually known about the earth’s core. Therefore, of course, creative minds took it and ran. Not only do some say it’s hollow, others claim there is another earth inside of the earth.\n\nAvril Lavigne died and was replaced by a girl named Melissa – According to this theory, Lavigne took her own life under the pressures that come with worldwide fame as well as the death of her grandfather. A lookalike and voice-alike clone was then found to replace her so that money could still be made. One of their main arguments of adherents to this theory is that Lavigne hasn’t produced songs as good as the ones before that time. Similar to, and equally as nonsensical as, the belief that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike/sound-alike. And in that storyline, the band was gracious enough to leave us clues on their album covers so we could know the truth.\n\nBritney Spears was an agent on George W. Bush’s payroll – The idea here is that she was staging some of her craziest moments to distract everyone from the failures and blunders made by the Bush administration. In 2004, when one of his staff leaked the name of a undercover CIA agent, Britney went to Vegas, partied, and got married. When Cheney accidentally shot a friend, she almost dropped her baby and stole the spotlight. When Bush made a bewildering announcement of a “reformation of Al-Qaeda,” she shaved her head. Then when Obama won the 2008 election, she began her comeback releasing her Circus album, as if celebrating that she was done serving.\n\nMalala Yousafzai a Western spy – Yousafzai has been a hero of women’s education and women’s rights in Pakistan for more than a decade. The conspiracy theory could believably be an attempt to undermine her influence, as it claims that her attempted murder (shot in the face by the Taliban) was staged or made up as a way to discredit the Taliban. And somehow, all of this was carried out by the CIA, her own father, and Robert de Niro.\n\nChemtrails – You know how when you see planes flying overhead they leave what looks like a long trail of exhaust? It’s apparently a mix of fuel and condensation, but there have long been suspicions held by conspiracy theorists that they are actually streaks of poison being emitted and falling to the earth. This is allegedly done by the government for different reasons. One of them I heard from a customer of mine while I worked on his vehicle. He said that it was pesticides to ruin farmers’ crops so that they can control how much they yield. Somehow it would also make the farmers more reliant on the government. You’d think someone getting in office would want to be a hero and blow the whistle.\n\nPrince Charles is a vampire – I think this mainly had to do with him being a direct descendent of Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration of Brahm Stoker’s Dracula. That and Porphyria, a disease that makes its sufferers sensitive to sunlight, runs through his royal family. Surely enough evidence for all of us to be believers.\n\nHarry Styles and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction a couple – I’m not sure if the “shippers” were fans or haters, but they spread the idea that these two band members were secretly a couple, appearing with women only to cover up their relationship. They both deny it, of course, but they do admit one thing: the conspiracy theory has made things weird when they’re together in the public eye.\n\nThe world ended in 2012 – This isn’t just the Mayan calendar prediction of the end of the world. This theory says that in 2012 Planet Earth was sucked into a black hole when CERN discovered the Higgs Boson particle that year. It claims that we all just haven’t realized this yet, either because we’re living in a simulation or because all of our minds are still active, causing us to think we’re alive as our remains are floating in space from the giant catastrophe.\n\nDenver International Airport is headquarters for evil world-domination – There are gargoyles and strange murals throughout this airport. I’ve seen them myself. The murals are beautiful and tell a story of peace and restoration, but the few depictions of death and war made people sure that it had to do with the Illuminati. Even the artists who painted the murals lost out on valuable commissions after the mural was completed and rumours swirled. But that’s the thing about super secret groups of elites who plan to take over the world. They often mistakenly give clues that announce their presence.\n\nCongratulations Don’t Look Up.
