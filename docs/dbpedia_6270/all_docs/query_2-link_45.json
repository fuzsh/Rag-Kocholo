I have a feeling I may have come out the better.\n\nRobert de Niro produced this.\n\nKenneth Lonergan wrote it.\n\nDes McAnuff directed it. (He primarily directs Shakespeare & musicals on stage!)\n\nThey all knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nThis is a faithful adaptation of the source material, and I don't know why it has such a negative reputation.\n\nAlso, it's got much more social commentary than I was expecting.\n\nINCOMPLETE ROSTER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THIS BONKERS-ASS FILM: Robert DeNiro. Jason Alexander. Rene Russo. Randy Quaid. Janeane Garofalo. Carl Reiner. Whoopi Goldberg. John Goodman. David Alan Grier. Doug Jones. Paget Brewster. Billy Crystal. Taraji P. Henson. The roastmaster general, Jeff Ross. Cory‚Äôs little sister from Boy Meets World. Kenan and Kel. The list truly goes on and on...\n\nOh, and if you somehow still aren‚Äôt sold on this gem ‚Äî it was written by KENNETH LONERGAN.\n\n[üìΩ: Showtime]\n\nThis is a fascinating movie. It captures the tone and spirit of the original Jay Ward cartoon pretty well, with its frequent puns and fourth wall jokes and you can tell the filmmakers had a genuine love for the material (Robert De Niro had apparently been wanting to make this for several years until he decided to produce the movie himself). Does it all work? No. Many jokes can be obvious and corny, but then you also wonder if that's the whole point. \"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\" knows exactly what it is as it frequently winks at the audience. There's almost a Muppet movie vibe with the characters being aware they're in a movie as well as the frequent‚Ä¶\n\n\"i wanted raging bull. i wanted casino. i got rocky and bullwinkle. but that's ok, because i still get to tell people i've worked with robert de niro\" - rene russo\n\nthis movie has it all: campy villains. taxi driver references. doug jones as a carrot. america by simon and garfunkel. \"yeah, and i'm really john goodman\". the mark mothersbaug score. a meta narrative to rival the matrix: resurrections\n\nthe fact that bobby d produced this and it was supposedly his passion project is still the funniest part, but it really wasn't as bad as it should've been. i mean, it's definitely bad, but it's also unironically great\n\nI can understand why people don't like Space Jam. I can understand why people don't like those Garfield or Yogi Bear or Smurfs or Woody Woodpecker or Alvin and the Chipmunks movies...but like... who was really that insulted by the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie not living up to their expectations exactly?? Like, who was expecting this to be that good in the first place?? It's not Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse. It's Rocky and Bullwinkle for fucks sake.\n\nBullwinkle can you rappel?\n\nSure! I‚Äôve been repelling viewers for years!\n\nThis is an incredibly stupid film, but you have to admire how fully committed it is to it‚Äôs own stupidity.\n\nI think the biggest issue is an overall inconsistency in style and direction. It‚Äôs like different actors thought they where in different movies. In fact, with a better director and some different casting this script might have had a chance.\n\nEven with it‚Äôs flaws, when you put it side by side with some of the other Y2K kids films like 102 Dalmatians and Dinosaur, I‚Äôd rather watch this one again every time.\n\nOkay now all you gotta do is type in an address and send him to where all worthless cyber junk ends up‚Ä¶the internet.\n\nCinematic Time Capsule - 2000 Ranked\n\nfollows a similar conceit to the last act of Last Action Hero, where the villains (including scenery chewing Robert De Niro, who also produced) climb out of the TV screen and intend to brain wash viewers with ‚Äúreally bad tv‚Äù and the only way to stop them is for the FBI to get Rocky and Bullwinkle out of reruns and into the real world ‚Äî patently absurd and much more clever, and funny, than it was given credit for at time of release\n\nFor a film that uses characters from a television show that was popular in the 1960s and 1970s, there is very little in \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" that might appeal to its original audience of Baby Boomers or even Gen-Xers. The original cartoon series was a semi-smart and satirical, pun-filled take on the Cold War; the film, however, is a dull, kid-targeted blend of live action and animation that rehashes characters and locations from Jay Ward's cartoon.\n\nThis is not to say the film is all bad. There is a nostalgic charge delivered from seeing the classic characters, and there is a charm to the assorted, well-placed puns. Aside from those pluses, the film is silly, broad, and features a big-name cast that never feels like it's doing anything more than slumming. While the film may be somewhat fun for children, adults might find it a bit of a chore."
