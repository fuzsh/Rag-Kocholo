        "text": "820: Space Mutiny\n\nby Wyn Hilty\n\n[Credit: “A Winters/Holiday Production.”] A Jonathan Winters/Billie Holiday production!\n\nJonathan Winters (1925-2013) was a stout-figured American comedian, actor, painter, and writer whose career spanned six decades. He recorded more than 25 best-selling comedy albums and won two Grammy Awards. Known for his lightning-fast improvisational skills, Winters made hundreds of TV appearances from the 1950s-1970s and appeared in such films as It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966). Billie “Lady Day” Holiday (1915-1959) is considered one of the greatest jazz singers of all time, with her greatest fame coming between the 1930s and the 1950s. She worked with legendary musicians like Count Basie and Artie Shaw and performed several times at Carnegie Hall.\n\n[Credit: “David Winters.”] Dave Winters! –Oh, right. –All right. –We’re in good hands here. Okay.\n\nDavid Winters, despite the low quality of this outing, is actually a respected actor, director, and choreographer. As a young man, he played A-Rab in the film version of West Side Story and appeared in numerous other films, TV shows, and stage productions. His work as a choreographer included several Elvis Presley films and four Ann-Margret films (including Show 615, Kitten with a Whip). As a director, his credits include Alice Cooper: Welcome to My Nightmare (1976, an acclaimed concert film) and the award-winning The Last Horror Film (1982, also known as Fanatic). Winters left the production of Space Mutiny early on due to a death in the family, and his directing duties were taken over by Neil Sundstrom. Both disliked the way the film turned out, and Winters tried unsuccessfully to have his name taken off the picture.\n\nTwenty exclusive hits by the original artists!\n\n“Best of” records were heavily advertised on TV. Not all were by the original artists, which could lead to disappointment. K-tel International was a major player in that market, and still exists online. 20 Explosive Hits by 20 Original Stars contained such dazzlers as “O-O-H Child” by Five Stairsteps and “Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)” by The Delfonics.\n\nSounds like someone owns himself a DX7 keyboard, huh?\n\nThe Yamaha DX7 keyboard was an affordable digital synthesizer sold from 1983 to 1989. Its moderate price and wide availability, coupled with the fact that it came with a wide array of preset sound effects, meant that it quickly became ubiquitous in ‘80s pop music, and then just as quickly became a cliché.\n\n[Credit: “Cameron Mitchell.”] Yay! Oh, no, wait.\n\nActor Cameron Mitchell (1918-1994) had a bit of a bipolar film career. He started out in respectable parts in major 1950s studio movies: Garden of Evil, Death of a Salesman, How to Marry a Millionaire, Carousel. Then in the ‘60s he went through a phase of crappy Italian films, like Mario Bava’s Erik the Conqueror and Blood and Black Lace. And finally in the ‘70s and ‘80s he slid downhill into the exploitation genre, starring in The Toolbox Murders, The Demon, and The Swarm.\n\nFeaturing music normally heard at the Days Inn lounge in Columbia Heights.\n\nDays Inn is a hotel chain founded in 1970 with more than 1,900 locations worldwide today. There are multiple burgs called Columbia Heights, but the writers were probably referring to the one in Minnesota, a northern suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n[Credit: “Written by Maria Danté.”] There’s gonna be seven levels of hell in this movie, too.\n\nIn the classic 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy, author Dante Alighieri wrote that Hell consists of nine concentric circles, or levels, each one designed to punish a different type of sinner. The first circle is limbo, containing people who died unbaptized and virtuous pagans. The second circle punishes lust; the third, gluttony; the fourth, greed; the fifth, wrath; the sixth, heresy; the seventh, violence; the eighth, fraud; and the ninth, treachery. At the center of the ninth circle, imprisoned for his treachery against God, is Lucifer.\n\nLike Pat Riley here, for instance.\n\nPat Riley is a former pro basketball player, broadcaster, and coach. He played for the San Diego Rockets and the LA Lakers in the 1970s and briefly worked as a broadcaster for the Lakers, but his real fame came as head coach for the Lakers in the 1980s, when he led the team to multiple NBA championships during that decade.\n\nI have this feeling I’m being followed by a lobster boy.\n\nLobster Boy was the stage name of Grady Stiles, Jr. (1937-1992), who had the deformity ectrodactyly, which causes the fingers and toes to fuse together and appear claw-like. Unable to walk normally, he “walked” using his arms, giving him tremendous upper-body strength. He made his living as a sideshow performer, but gained notoriety after his abusive and alcoholic family life led to murder. He was convicted of murdering his daughter’s fiancé in 1978, but since no prison could accommodate his deformities, he was given probation. Stiles himself was killed in 1992, the victim of a murder-for-hire scheme arranged by his wife and stepson. Lobster Boy’s story was the subject of a book and several cable TV specials.\n\nHe’s like an Armand Assante-wanta-be.\n\nArmand Assante is an American actor known for playing gangsters and tough guys in films like Hoffa (1992), American Gangster (2007), and the 1996 HBO miniseries Gotti.\n\nI’ll show you how to use a label maker properly.\n\nModern label makers are streamlined devices that look like cell phones, but when this episode was written a typical label maker was a pistol-like gadget with a disk on top that the user turned manually to select and then print letters and numbers.\n\nHe made a bomb out of soap and Paco Rabanne.\n\nFashion designer Paco Rabanne has an entire line of fragrances, but Paco Rabanne pour homme, introduced in 1973, is presumably the one being referenced here.\n\nMelissa Manchester!\n\nMelissa Manchester is an adult contemporary singer-songwriter, known for such songs as “Through the Eyes of Love” (used as the theme for the 1978 movie Ice Castles), and the ‘80s hits “You Should Hear How She Talks About You,” and a cover of “Walk on By.”\n\n[Sung to “Blue Danube.”] Dah-dah-dah-dah lame, bum-bum, lame lame …\n\nJohann Strauss the Younger (1825-1899) was an Austrian composer known especially for his waltzes, of which “The Blue Danube,” being sung here, is the most famous. Its current-day fame is due partly to its use in the Stanley Kubrick film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), during an extended sequence in which a shuttle docks with a space station.\n\nOi.\n\nIn the 1980s, former Australian rules footballer Mark “Jacko” Jackson snagged a contract as a pitchman for Energizer batteries. Known for his shock of bright blond hair and his antics on the field, Jackson’s catchphrase in the commercials was “Oi!”\n\nSting, Debbie Reynolds, and God.\n\nBlond pop singer Gordon “Sting” Sumner achieved worldwide fame as a member of the band The Police and later as a solo artist. Actress and singer Debbie Reynolds (1932-2016) was known for wholesome musicals like Singin’ in the Rain (1952), The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964), and The Singing Nun (1966). She was the mother of fellow actress Carrie Fisher, who died one day before Reynolds did, in December 2016. The generally accepted image of God as an old man with white hair and a beard began to show up in Western art sometime around the 12th century, and comes from a passage in the Book of Daniel: “I beheld until the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days [i.e., God] did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool” (Daniel 7:9).\n\nGraphics by Kenner.\n\nKenner Products was a toy company founded in Cincinnati in 1947. It enjoyed phenomenal success when it introduced Star Wars action figures in the late 1970s. The company was bought and sold several times; in 2000, Hasbro, its latest owner, closed the Cincinnati office and merged Kenner’s toy lines with its own.\n\n[Sung to “Blue Danube.”] Dah-dah-dah-dah crap …\n\nSee above note on the “Blue Danube.”\n\nSpecial effects by Industrial Light and Morons.\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic is the visual effects company founded by director George Lucas in 1975. Lucas wanted hands-on control for his upcoming project Star Wars, so he gathered some of the giants in the special effects field. Since then, they have provided visual effects for nearly 300 films and won dozens of awards, including 15 Oscars.\n\nUh-oh, an air show. Look out below!\n\nAccidents at air shows are comparatively rare, given that there are hundreds of the things held every year, and when they do happen they tend to be fatal to the pilots rather than the spectators. However, there have been some spectacularly lethal incidents. One of the worst occurred in 1988 at the U.S. air force base in Ramstein, Germany, when three jets collided close to the ground, killing all three pilots and hurling fiery wreckage into the watching crowd. Sixty-seven people on the ground died, and hundreds more were injured.\n\nEh, I told you we should have landed at LaGuardia.\n\nLaGuardia Airport, located in Queens, is the smallest of the three airports serving metropolitan New York City (the other two are JFK and Newark Liberty). It is named after Fiorello La Guardia, who was mayor of New York when the airport was built in the late 1930s.\n\n“Commander Kalgan.” Calgon?!\n\nCalgon scented bath products include bubble bath, body lotions, and more.\n\nKalgan, blow me away.\n\n“Calgon, take me away” is a longtime advertising slogan for their bath products (see previous note).\n\nToo right!\n\n“Too right!” was another of Mark “Jacko” Jackson’s shouted Aussie-isms in his Energizer commercials (see above note).\n\n[Explosion.] So, really, how does this help the Basque separatists?\n\nThe Basque homeland is a section of land on the border between France and Spain. Basques have traditionally held themselves apart from other inhabitants of the area—their language and customs bear no resemblance to those of other European groups. The movement to form a separate Basque nation began at the turn of the 20th century and grew stronger after Spanish dictator Francisco Franco came to power in the 1940s. During the late 1970s the movement turned violent, with numerous terrorist attacks carried out by the Basque separatist group ETA. Things have calmed considerably since then, but relations between the separatists and the Spanish government remain tense.\n\nMy stair stepper!\n\nStair steppers, such as the StairMaster 4000, which was introduced in 1986, were enormously popular in the 1980s and 1990s. Rather than earlier stair climbing machines, which used a rotating set of stairs to simulate climbing stairs, the SM 4000 used a set of pedals to mimic the motion.\n\nMy Buns of Steel videos are in there!\n\nBuns of Steel was an exercise video that came out in the 1980s, focused on developing the gluteus maximus muscles.\n\nJohn Waters!\n\nJohn Waters is a famously quirky Baltimore filmmaker who sports a pencil-thin mustache and slicked-back hair. He has written, directed, and produced such films as the deliberately offensive Pink Flamingos (1972) and the somewhat more mainstream Hairspray (1988).\n\nHey, look at this. The office newsletter says I look like Susan Powter.\n\nThe Australian-born Susan Powter was an infomercial queen back in the early 1990s, a workout guru whose motto was “Stop the Insanity!” Known for her platinum-blond crewcut, she had several books on the best-seller list and even did her own talk show for a year.\n\nSanta’s playing FreeCell over here.\n\nFreeCell is a variant of solitaire that became popular in the computer world after Microsoft included it in its Windows operating system. In the game, you deal the cards into eight columns, with the goal being to move all the cards onto four “foundation” piles by suit.\n\nShould I spend twenty bucks for Griffey?\n\nMost likely a reference to purchasing a collectible baseball card, specifically one picturing three-time All-Star George Kenneth Griffey Sr., or his even more famous son Ken “The Kid” Griffey Jr., a 13-time All-Star.\n\n[Male choral music on soundtrack.] So, uh, we got some Benedictine monks in the floorboards, unfortunately. We have set some traps with fresh bread and brandy, though.\n\nThe Order of Saint Benedict is a Catholic religious order founded in the sixth century C.E. In the medieval era, members of monasteries sang a type of choral music known as Gregorian chants as part of their worship practice, although this was not specific to the Benedictine order. The Benedictines did supposedly invent the herbal liqueur named after them (although this story is apparently apocryphal, spread by the liqueur’s actual creator to increase sales), which is traditionally mixed with brandy to create the drink known as B&B.\n\nWhoa! Drank too much Surge.\n\nSurge is a caffeinated citrus drink introduced by Coca-Cola in an effort to compete with Pepsi’s Mountain Dew.\n\nRobbie Robertson.\n\nCanadian musician Robbie Robertson (1943-2023) was best known for his work as the lead singer and main songwriter for The Band, where he wrote such songs as “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” and “Up on Cripple Creek.” Later in his career he turned to writing film soundtracks, working especially with director Martin Scorsese on films like Raging Bull (1980) and Casino (1995). He also took a brief turn as an actor, appearing in (and producing and co-writing) the 1980 drama Carny, and landing a small role in the 1995 Jack Nicholson movie The Crossing Guard.\n\nOi.\n\nSee above note on Mark “Jacko” Jackson.\n\nOi.\n\nSee above note on Mark “Jacko” Jackson.\n\nOi.\n\nSee above note on Mark “Jacko” Jackson.\n\n“One other thing.” Oi.\n\nSee above note on Mark “Jacko” Jackson.\n\nDeath by snicker-snag.\n\nThe Urban Dictionary website actually credits MST3K with bringing the phrase “snicker-snag,” meaning to hold someone down and dangle spit above their face, into the popular vernacular.\n\n“Are there any other of you that wish to confuse freedom with treason?” I’d like to confuse bok choy with cabbage, sir.\n\nBok choy is in fact a variety of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa), although it does not form round heads like the white cabbage Americans are familiar with; it looks more like wide celery. Bok choy in Cantonese translates literally as “white vegetable.” It is commonly used in stir-fries and soups, though it is also good in salads.\n\nDo you know where I can get some Zubaz, man?\n\nZubaz are a brand of zebra-striped pants, designed initially as workout wear for bulky bodybuilders who could not fit into traditional clothing. They became a fashion trend in the early 1990s.\n\nYou’ve got mail.\n\n“You’ve got mail!” is the sound bite used by America Online to inform its users of new email; voiceover professional Elwood Edwards supplied the voice. The phrase became so well known that it was used as the title of a 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.\n\nOi?\n\nSee above note on Mark “Jacko” Jackson.\n\nWe now switch live to Spencer’s Gifts.\n\nSpencer Gifts—now just Spencer’s—is a retailer with locations in shopping malls throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Targeting a 12- to 25-year-old demographic, the stores offer rock and roll clothing, band merchandise, gag gifts, room décor, fashion, and body jewelry. The plasma ball (also called a plasma lamp) seen here is pretty typical of their merchandise. The first plasma lamp was created by legendary inventor Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), although the modern version was developed by MIT student Bill Parker.\n\n[Sung, slowly.] Hey, Macarena.\n\n“Macarena” was a Spanish-language song recorded by Spanish band Los del Rio in 1993. An English-language remix by the Bayside Boys spent 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996, with an accompanying dance that was a brief fad. This coincided with an election year in the U.S., which led to the uncomfortable sight of middle-aged, rhythmically challenged politicos doing the Macarena on national television. (Vice President Al Gore, who had a reputation for being boring, offered to do his version of the Macarena at the Democratic National Convention: he stood perfectly still for several seconds and then asked, “Would you like to see it again?”)\n\n[Imitating.] Ayyyyy.\n\nAn imitation of Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli, a character on the TV sitcom Happy Days, which aired from 1974-1984. Played by Henry Winkler, Fonzie became known for his trademark thumbs-up, accompanied by the above catchphrase.\n\nIt’s a Wicca Tupperware party.\n\nWicca, a pagan religious movement, began in England in the early 20th century. Although it has no official hierarchy, its beliefs were initially set down in the 1950s by Gerald Gardner, who worked as a civil servant in Sri Lanka and Malaya. Wiccans worship a male and a female god, and practice ritual magic. Tupperware is a brand of plastic storage containers that are traditionally sold at “Tupperware parties,” in which a sales representative (usually a woman) makes her pitch to a group (again, usually women) gathered at someone’s home. They were first made in 1946.\n\nMy poultice!\n\nA poultice is any type of medicated goo that is spread on a cloth and applied to the body to relieve inflammation or aches.\n\nDamn Swedish ergonomic chairs—how do you sit comfortably on these?\n\nIn 1979, Norwegian designer Hans Christian Mengshoel created the Balans chair, an ergonomic chair designed to make the user divide his weight evenly between his knees and his rump. (The idea was to reduce lower back strain.) Several other Norwegian designers came up with their own variants on the chair. Studies of the chairs were mixed; most found they provided little or no benefit and might even make things worse.\n\nMother Angelica aerobics.\n\nMother Angelica (b. Rita Rizzo; 1923-2016) was a Roman Catholic nun and the founder of the Eternal Word Television Network, a Catholic religious network. For many years she hosted EWTN’s flagship program, Mother Angelica Live. She passed away in 2016, but EWTN still airs reruns of her old shows.\n\n“I want you to meet my daughter Lea.” We’re about the same age.\n\nIn 1988, the year Space Mutiny was released, Cameron Mitchell (playing Captain Jansen) was 70. Cisse Cameron, playing his daughter Lea, was 34. I actually think she looks pretty good for 34; the problem is she’s cast in a role usually reserved for 24-year-olds. (There is reason to suspect, however, that Ms. Cameron may have been closer to 38; in 1967 she was a freshman at Butler University in Indianapolis, where she was voted Miss Watermelon Bust by the Lamda Chi Alpha fraternity.) Incidentally, she’s now (2017) in her 60s and looks spectacular. (Thanks to Rosemary for the Miss Watermelon Bust info.)\n\nYou’re getting a lump of coal.\n\nThe tradition of leaving lumps of coal in naughty children’s Christmas stockings isn’t just a Santa Claus myth; St. Nicholas, Sinterklaas, and Le Befana (Italy) do it as well. No one seems to be sure where it came from, but it’s speculated it may just be a question of convenience: the stockings are hung by the chimney with care, after all, so Santa/St. Nick/etc. can just grab a piece of coal from the fireplace and drop it in. Other gifts left for the bad kids have included bundles of twigs, salt, garlic, and onions.\n\nHey, one of the New Monkees.\n\nNot the Monkees, the 1960s’ “Pre-Fab Four”: the New Monkees. Launched by television and record producers in 1987 after the previous year saw renewed interest in the original Monkees thanks to their 20th anniversary, The New Monkees consisted of Jared Chandler, Dino Kovas, Marty Ross, and Larry Saltis. They made a syndicated television show, The New Monkees, which was cancelled after thirteen episodes, and their sole album sold abysmally. During their short tenure, the original Monkees sued the band and the producers, but the case was settled out of court.\n\nOh, Gopher, are you lost?\n\nBurl “Gopher” Smith was “Your Yeoman Purser” on the ABC television series The Love Boat from 1977 to 1986. He was played by Fred Grandy. From 1987 to 1995, Grandy served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Iowa. From 1995 to 2000, he was the CEO of Goodwill Industries.

The four original flavors were strawberry, lemon, orange, and lime. (Cherry replaced lime years later.) They were introduced to the United States in 1967.\n\nThey have the best minigolf in the galaxy.\n\nMiniature golf is exactly what it sounds like: a miniature version of the game of golf.

Which I think is very sweet.\n\nThis is like when I plateaued on my delts, man.\n\nIn the parlance of bodybuilding, the dreaded “plateau” is when a weightlifting program suddenly stops producing muscle growth, even though it’s being followed rigorously. “Delts” is short for the deltoid muscles, which sort of drape over the tops of the shoulders.\n\nShake it, Ralph Macchio!\n\nRalph Macchio is an actor best known for playing the title role in the 1980s Karate Kid movies; he also appeared in the films My Cousin Vinny (1992) and Hitchcock (2012), and in the TV series Eight Is Enough in 1981 and Ugly Betty in 2008-2009.\n\nEh, Mike, I bet you were really into the Thompson Twins, right?

It was pulled off shelves in 1978 when the FDA connected certain liquid protein drinks with about 60 deaths from heart failure. (The deaths were apparently due to rapid weight loss and a lack of adequate nutrients; people following the recommended Metrecal weight-loss plan were surviving on about 900 calories a day.)\n\nMan. I’d rather get a table dance from Trent Lott.\n\nTrent Lott was a Republican senator from Mississippi in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In 2002 he resigned his leadership post after giving a speech at Senator Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday party, saying of the longtime segregationist, “When [he] ran for president, we voted for him. … And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn’t have had all these problems over the years, either.”\n\nThis is less subtle than an Annie Sprinkle performance piece.\n\nThe performance artist Annie Sprinkle had an infamous one-woman show called “Public Cervix Announcement,” which involved the audience getting to view that portion of her anatomy up close and personal using a speculum and a flashlight.\n\nOh, she’s presenting like a mandrill!\n\nMandrills, a large monkey native to central Africa, are one of the species of primates that exhibit sexual swelling: when the females are ready to mate, their external genitalia swell with water, becoming greatly engorged and red. Males are attracted to, and will compete for, females with the largest sexual swelling. Females that are ready to mate will “present” by facing away from the male on all fours and looking back over their shoulders.\n\nTwo for one techno drinks. Cool.\n\nAlso known as smart drinks or nootropic drinks, these are fruit juices laced with vitamins, amino acids, and herbal supplements. They were popular at raves in the late 1980s and ‘90s, when ecstasy, ketamine, and other drugs were the mood-altering substances of choice, rather than alcohol. Additives included things like choline, L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, and B vitamins.\n\nWow, it’s like Nick and Nora Charles.\n\nNick and Nora Charles were fictional detectives who appeared in Dashiell Hammett’s 1934 mystery novel The Thin Man.

De plane!” on the TV show Fantasy Island, which he appeared on from 1978-1983. He became depressed and worked very little after leaving the series, ultimately killing himself in 1993. He did not, however, die in a car; he shot himself in his home in North Hollywood. “Death car” is a common shorthand for a car in which a celebrity has died: Bonnie and Clyde’s death car, or Princess Diana’s death car.\n\nHit the siren! [Sung.] [“Circus music.”]\n\nWhile most people know this as “that circus song,” the actual title is “Entrance of the Gladiators.” It was composed in 1897 as a military march by Czech composer Julius Fučík.

How are they going to fill their cows?\n\nThe world’s 1.5 billion cows produce a lot of methane, which is a very strong greenhouse gas (its effect on global warming is about 20 times worse than carbon dioxide’s). Estimates vary, but your average cow emits somewhere between 25 and 130 gallons of methane every day via eructation and flatulence (or belching and farting, for the less refined). That’s about as much pollution as your average car.\n\n“Open file on …” Blitzen.\n\nBlitzen is one of Santa’s reindeer, first mentioned in the 1823 poem “A Visit From Saint Nicholas,” written by Clement Clarke Moore.

Although Americans use it simply as another term for Santa, other countries (like Canada and Australia) use it as a term for “Secret Santa.”\n\nWanna see me shake like a bowl full of jelly?\n\nA line from the aforementioned poem “A Visit From Saint Nicholas” (see previous note). The relevant lines: “He had a broad face, and a little round belly/That shook when he laugh’d, like a bowl full of jelly.”\n\nI am a right jolly old elf.\n\nAnd that’s from the next line of “A Visit From Saint Nicholas”: “He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf/And I laugh’d when I saw him in spite of myself.”\n\nLet me just check you twice here …\n\nA reference to the Christmas song “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” written by John Frederick Coots and Haven Gillespie and first recorded in 1934.

He has also appeared in Masters of the Universe (1987), The Punisher (1989), and The Expendables films (the first in 2010).\n\n“Commander, we have a problem.” I’m out of Mega Fuel.\n\nProbably a reference to Twinlab Mass Fuel, another weight gainer powder that offers a bucket o’ protein in every scoop.\n\nLaraine Newman and the Newmanettes!\n\nLaraine Newman is a comedian and actress best known for her tenure on Saturday Night Live as part of that show’s original cast, appearing from 1975-1980. As a voice artist in the 2000s, she’s appeared in WALL-E, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and many other animated films and TV series. Known for her bone-thin figure, Newman reportedly suffered from drug problems and an eating disorder during her SNL days.\n\nOh, now they stole the Enterprise’s red alert sound thingy.\n\nYes, they did. The sound effects for the original Star Trek TV series (1966-1969) were created by a handful of sound editors led by Doug Grindstaff, who was nominated for an Emmy for his work on the first season. Many of their effects have become iconic, like the sound of the transporter, the whoosh of the ship’s doors opening, and the hum of the phasers firing.\n\n[Imitating music.] Sounds like Kitaro fell asleep on his keyboard.\n\nKitaro is a Japanese composer known for his New Age synthesizer pieces.\n\n“Stop right there!” Would you like to sample some Canoe?\n\nThe House of Dana was founded by Javier Serra in 1932. Under perfumer Jean Carles, they released such well-known scents as Tabu, Emir, and Canoe. By the 1980s, however, the company was on its last legs, and after a series of acquisitions it was transformed into New Dana, which makes a string of low-level perfumes sold in drugstores and discount department stores. Among them: Love’s Baby Soft, English Leather, and, still, Canoe.\n\nA horse, my kingdom for a horse.\n\nFrom William Shakespeare’s play Richard III, Act V, Scene IV: “A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!” In the play Shakespeare referred to Richard as a “poisonous bunch-backed toad,” and traditionally actors have portrayed the character as having a hunchback, a withered arm, and a limp. A lively debate eventually sprang up over whether this image was accurate. Shakespeare wrote the play c. 1592, when Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne; her grandfather, Henry VII, defeated Richard III in battle to claim the throne of England. So portraying Richard III as a deformed murdering villain was clearly in the playwright's best interest. However, in 2012, archaeologists unearthed Richard’s skeleton under a parking lot in Leicester and discovered that while he didn’t have a limp or a withered arm, he did suffer from adult-onset scoliosis, a twist in the spine, which may have made one of his shoulders higher than the other. So there may be some basis for the hunchback story.\n\nOoh, someone get me a Zantac, quick!\n\nZantac is an acid reducer used to relieve the symptoms of heartburn, and as a treatment for peptic ulcers and acid reflux. It is available in both prescription and nonprescription forms.\n\nWell, they rented a pneumatic catapult, and damn it, they’re gonna use it.\n\nIn stunt work, an air ram is a catapult powered by air pressure and used to throw the stunt performer through the air (e.g., after an explosion). The performer steps on a pedal, which triggers the release of the compressed air, sending the stuntman flying.\n\nI think they just borrowed the South High marching band uniforms.\n\nSouth High School is the largest public high school in Minneapolis, with an enrollment of around 2,000 students. It was founded in 1885 and has become a highly respected school, known for its ethnic diversity, extracurricular activities, and liberal arts program. Their music program offers classes in band, choir, jazz, strings, orchestra, singing, piano, and guitar, but they don’t have a marching band.\n\nSo this takes place at the Anheuser Busch brewery, or …\n\nAnheuser-Busch (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) is an American brewing company founded in 1852 and best known for making Budweiser, Busch, and Michelob, among many others. They have multiple breweries located around the country, including ones in St. Louis, Houston, and Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nPlease don’t shoot us … okay, but you won’t get a box lunch, then.\n\nIn the movie business, extras hired to fill out a scene are generally paid a set per diem fee, with overtime if the shoot goes long. If the shoot is over a certain number of hours, each extra is given a box lunch.\n\n[Evil laughter.] You see, I’m handicapable.\n\nHandicapable, along with “differently abled” and “physically challenged,” is a politically correct term for the disabled. It never really caught on and is rarely heard today, unless dripping with sarcasm.\n\nOoh, he needs a giant Tucks.\n\nTucks medicated pads are pre-moistened pads soaked in a solution of witch hazel. They are used to relieve the itching and burning sensations associated with hemorrhoids.\n\nStupid Buddhist monk, the Vietnam War’s been over for hundreds of years!\n\nBuddhist monk Thich Quang Duc famously set himself on fire in Saigon to protest persecution of his religion in Vietnam in 1963. It was captured by AP photographer Malcolm Browne, who won a Pulitzer for his work. Several monks followed Duc’s example, increasing pressure on the regime, which was brought down by an army coup five months later.\n\nWell, if there’s one thing this movie does well, it’s tossing Canadians around.\n\nActually, Space Mutiny was a South African production.\n\nWait, Canadians? –Oh, come on, Mike, this movie’s ripe with the stench of back bacon.\n\nBack bacon is a cut of pork that includes part of the pork loin and part of the belly, so it winds up being leaner than American-style bacon, which is made only from pork belly. If it is cured and smoked, Americans refer to it as … Canadian bacon.\n\n[Imitating.] I must say.\n\nSee above note on Ed Grimley.\n\n[Imitating.] We’re being totally defeated, I must say.\n\nSee above note on Ed Grimley.\n\n“Lea! MacPhearson!” That’s a really good strut suspension!\n\nEarle MacPherson was chief engineer of Chevy’s Light Car project in the mid-1940s, which was working on designing consumer cars for the post-World War II era. While on that project, he invented a new kind of strut that became commonly used in the front suspension of modern cars and was ultimately named after him: the MacPherson strut.\n\n[Sung.] Spider skank, spider skank …\n\nSpider-Man is a Marvel Comics character created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, who debuted in 1962. From 1977-1979 he got his own live-action TV series, The Amazing Spider-Man, which boasted this catchy theme song: “Spider-Man, Spider-Man/Does whatever a spider can/Spins a web, any size/Catches thieves just like flies/Look out!/Here comes the Spider-Man.” The song was so well-known that it has made cameo appearances in many of the big-budget Spider-Man film adaptations of the 2000s.\n\nMan, I shouldn’t have ridden my recumbent bike to work.\n\nRecumbent bikes are bikes in which the rider leans back against a reclined seat. They are more aerodynamic and faster than standard bicycles, but tend to be less maneuverable. They were actually invented in the 19th century, but did not become widely commercially available until the 1980s.\n\nAh, into a nice sitz bath.\n\nA sitz bath (from the German for “sit”) is a bath where one sits in warm, possibly medicated water up to hip level. They are used to alleviate various complaints “down there,” including hemorrhoids and bladder infections.\n\n“Now it is time for Kalgan.” Recommended by top breeders.\n\nKal Kan was a brand of canned dog food, but the manufacturer changed its name to Pedigree starting in 1988. However, the name now appears to be back, on a brand of dog food sold through Walmart. “Developed by vets. Recommended by top breeders” was an ad slogan for Pedigree.\n\nWell, someone dropped a jar of Hellmann’s in aisle seven, I gotta go clean it up.\n\nHellmann’s mayonnaise (or Best Foods, as it is also known) was created by German immigrant Richard Hellmann in his New York delicatessen; he began selling it commercially in 1913. Best Foods, a San Francisco company with its own brand of mayo, bought him out in 1927 but decided to preserve both brand names. Today Hellmann’s is sold east of the Rockies and in Europe, Latin America, Australia, the Middle East, and Canada. Best Foods got the United States west of the Rockies, Asia, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand.\n\nPush on, mighty Cushman!\n\nCushman, founded in 1903, started out making engines for farm equipment, boats, and the like, and made scooters during the Depression and World War II. They began making golf carts in the 1950s, and still do today.\n\nYou know, in their silliest moments, the Three Stooges never reached this level of indignity.\n\nThe Three Stooges was a slapstick comedy trio that performed for five decades in the 20th century. They got their start in a vaudeville act called Ted Healy and His Stooges. The first lineup was Moe Howard (Moses Horwitz; 1897-1975), Shemp Howard (Samuel Horwitz; 1895-1955), and Larry Fine (Louis Feinberg; 1902-1975). Comedian Healy became angered that the Stooges were becoming more popular than him and Shemp left, leading Curly Howard (Jerome Horwitz; 1903-1952) to join in 1932. The Stooges finally left Healy in 1934 and began their famous run of 190 shorts and five films for Columbia Pictures. Typical Stooges routines included slaps, eye gouging, hair pulling, and other slapstick violence.\n\nYou know, a lot of people have compared this scene to the climactic chariot scene in Ben-Hur?\n\nBen-Hur was a 1959 Hollywood epic starring Charlton Heston. One of the most famous scenes in the film is of a vicious chariot race.\n\nReally? –Yeah, you know, they usually say “Ben-Hur was really good. This movie totally sucks.”\n\nAt the time, Ben-Hur was the highest-grossing film of 1959, as well as the second-highest-grossing film in history (Gone with the Wind was the first), earning $66.1 million (the equivalent today of $146.9 million). It also won a record-setting eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a record that stood until Titanic matched it in 1997.\n\nAny second Lea’s gonna jump on her Big Wheel and give chase.\n\nBig Wheels are a brand of tricycle that have been around for more than 40 years. They are made of brightly colored plastic and boast a front wheel that is much larger than the two back wheels. Introduced in 1969, they were highly popular in the ‘70s.\n\n“Meddling fool!” What, is he Snidely Whiplash?\n\nSnidely Whiplash was Canadian Mountie Dudley Do-Right’s archnemesis on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, which aired on a couple of different networks between 1959 and 1964. Distinguished by his top hat, curling mustachios, and fondness for tying maidens to railroad tracks, Whiplash was a stereotypical villain from the old silent serials and Victorian melodramas. He was voiced in the cartoons by Hans Conried and played by Alfred Molina in the 1999 live-action film Dudley Do-Right, which starred Brendan Fraser.\n\nAccursed mountebank!\n\nHistorical trivia: a mountebank was a peddler of quack medicines, so calling someone a mountebank is calling them a charlatan or a fraud. The word comes from the Italian montambanco, which loosely means “mount on bench”—something the peddlers would do while selling their wares.\n\nToro! Toro! These things are made by Toro!\n\nToro is an American manufacturer of lawn maintenance equipment, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. It was founded in 1914 as the exclusive provider of engines for The Bull Tractor Company (thus the name “Toro,” which is Spanish for “bull”).\n\nStill, it’s better than Days of Thunder. –A lot. –Yeah.\n\nDays of Thunder is a 1990 auto racing film starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Plagued by schedule difficulties and budget overruns, it was largely panned by critics but was nonetheless successful at the box office, grossing $157 million.\n\nHe shouldn’t have been carrying that case of cleaning fluid and nitroglycerin and gelignite in there.\n\nNitroglycerin is an organic nitrate compound that is used in the making of explosives. Curiously, taken in small quantities, nitroglycerin is also a powerful vasodilator, meaning it dilates the veins around the heart, so it is used medically for treating heart conditions such as angina. Gelignite is an explosive material made by soaking cotton in nitroglycerin.\n\nPlus he microwaved an egg at the same time.\n\nMicrowaving a beaten egg is fine. Microwaving an egg in its shell will cause a rather messy explosion due to steam building up inside the shell as the egg cooks.\n\nNot since the Fuzzy Zoeller/Lee Trevino collision of 1974 has there been such a horrible golf cart accident.\n\nFrank Urban Zoeller, better known as Fuzzy, and Lee Trevino are both professional golfers; Trevino is retired, while Zoeller still tours as a senior golfer. In 1975 Trevino was struck by lightning and seriously injured; however, he recovered and resumed his golf career. As far as can be determined, neither has been in a golf cart accident, although such incidents are on the rise, going from a reported 5,700 cases in 1990 to more than 18,000 golf cart-related injuries nationwide requiring emergency room treatment in 2015.\n\nLeah, this could be the start of a beautiful alternate-day bulk-up routine.\n\nIn the final scene of the classic 1942 film Casablanca, as the two of them walk into the distance, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) says to Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” Bodybuilders typically work different muscle groups on alternate days in their pursuit of pumping themselves up.\n\nCajun pan-blackened Kalgan.\n\nCajun cuisine, popularized by Louisiana chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author Paul Prudhomme (1940-2015), involves relatively simple but spicy dishes that feature onion, bell peppers, celery, rice, shrimp, and pork sausage as key ingredients. Blackening involves fish or other meat dipped in butter, dredged in spices, and then seared on a very hot cast iron skillet, creating a black crust on the outside. Blackening was a regional and fairly obscure technique that became wildly popular nationwide in the 1980s, thanks again to Prudhomme.\n\nMe, take me away!\n\nSee above note on Calgon.\n\nWe don’t need more Kalgan.\n\nSee above note on Calgon.\n\nMusic rejected by the band Survivor.\n\nSurvivor is a Chicago rock band founded in 1978 and best known for its 1982 hit “Eye of the Tiger,” which was the theme song for the film Rocky III. It won a Grammy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Song.\n\nThe lobsterman was played by Guy Pringle.\n\nGuy Pringle was a Hollywood stuntman in the 1980s, with credits on 15 films, including American Ninja 2, Captive Rage, and Show 516, Alien from L.A.\n\nWow. Wouldn’t want to slam a stack of that guy.\n\n“Slam the stack” was an ad slogan for Pringles potato chips in the 1990s. Pringles were developed by Procter & Gamble in 1967 and are now owned by Kellogg’s. Unlike other chips, which involve slices of actual potatoes and come in bags, Pringles are machine-made: compressed potato residue and wheat starch chips sold neatly stacked in cylindrical cardboard tubes.\n\n[Sung.] She’s a maniac, maniac on the floor …\n\nA line from the song “Maniac” from the soundtrack of the 1983 movie Flashdance, which starred Jennifer Beals as a steelworker with dreams of becoming a dancer. The song was performed by Michael Sembello. Sample lyrics: “She’s a maniac, maniac on the floor/And she’s dancing like she’s never danced before …”\n\n[Sung.] Don’t pay the ferryman/Don’t even fix that price …\n\n“Don’t Pay the Ferryman” is a 1982 song by Chris de Burgh, from his album The Getaway. It was a modest hit in the U.S. and U.K. but a bigger one in Australia, making the top ten in that country. Sample lyrics: “Don’t pay the ferryman/Don’t even fix a price/Don’t pay the ferryman/Until he gets you to the other side.”\n\n[Sung.] Maniac, maniac on the floor …\n\nSee previous note.\n\nEverybody! [Sung.] Someday love will find you …\n\n“Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)” is a 1983 song by American rock band Journey, from their Frontiers album. It was the first single for which the band shot a music video (previous videos had been cobbled together from concert footage), and the result was infamously bad, with the band members inexplicably playing imaginary instruments.\n\nYou know, they really did have excellent clapping and loading.\n\nIn film jargon, a clapper/loader is the person responsible for clapping the little slate at the beginning of shots that the editor later uses to synchronize audio and video, as well as for loading more film into the camera. The term is mostly used outside the U.S., as in Europe and Australia; in the United States the position is called the second assistant cameraman, or second AC.\n\nSo the best boy they could come up with was Fuzzy Skinner?\n\nThe best boy acts as an assistant to the lead technician of two departments: electrics, and lighting and rigging. The head of electrics is called the gaffer, and his assistant is called the best boy electric. The head of lighting and rigging is the key grip, and his assistant is the best boy grip. Female best boys are sometimes titled best girls. Fuzzy Skinner only worked on a few films; Space Mutiny was his first.\n\nYeah, hold on, I got one. [Sung.] I wear my sunglasses at night/So I can …\n\nA reference to the song “Sunglasses at Night” by pop star Corey Hart, which was a huge hit in 1984. Sample lyrics: “I wear my sunglasses at night/So I can so I can/Keep track of the visions in my eyes …”\n\nThis band will be appearing at the Bombay Bicycle Club later this weekend.\n\nThe Bombay Bicycle Club was a tropical-themed chain of restaurants popular in the 1990s. It was supposedly named after a club founded in India in 1898 by British colonial officers.\n\nSo you sit there, all mushy and sentimental, reciting to yourself the words to some song by Night Ranger. You’re pathetic.\n\nNight Ranger was an American rock band popular in the 1980s; their biggest hit was 1984’s “Sister Christian.”"
