        "text": "Robert M. Bakish is President and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Global. Bakish oversees one of the world’s leading producers of media and entertainment content, driven by a global portfolio of powerful consumer brands and flagship streaming platforms, including CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Paramount+, and Pluto TV, among others. In this role, which he assumed in December 2019, Bakish is responsible for growing the company’s creative assets, content capabilities and streaming services to serve important and diverse audiences, which consume over 30 billion hours of Paramount content globally across more than 180 countries.\n\nBakish’s leadership was integral to the successful merger of Viacom and CBS as he led the transformation efforts within the new company, combining two great cultures, formalizing a best-in-class leadership team and aligning the organization around strategic growth priorities centered on streaming. Importantly, Bakish created a new, unified global streaming organization and strategy to maximize Paramount content across pay, free and premium streaming services spotlighted by Paramount+, Pluto TV and Showtime OTT.\n\nPrior to the recombination of Viacom and CBS, Bakish was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom since December 2016. He led the revitalization and evolution of Viacom’s core businesses, returning the company to growth, and extending its leadership across multiplatform entertainment content, next-generation distribution and advertising. Through a strategy to deepen and expand Viacom’s presence in digital and live experiences, Bakish also stewarded the key acquisitions of free streaming television service Pluto TV; Gen-Z focused brand Awesomeness; influencer marketing firm WHOSAY; and VidCon, the world’s largest celebration of online video fans and creators.\n\nBakish previously headed the company’s international business as President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) since 2007. Under his leadership, VIMN more than doubled revenues and broadened its portfolio with new, broadly distributed pay-TV networks, including Spike and the Paramount Channel, as well as general entertainment broadcast networks Channel 5 in the U.K., Telefe in Argentina and Colors in India. At the same time, he guided the company to launch Viacom Play Plex and other innovative mobile streaming offerings that introduced a new generation of young audiences to Viacom’s popular brands and IP.\n\nBakish joined Viacom in 1997, and held a series of senior corporate, sales and development positions at the company. He previously worked as a partner with Booz Allen & Hamilton in its Media and Entertainment practice.\n\nBakish has an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School and a B.S. in Operations Research from Columbia’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. He serves on the boards of both schools and is also a Director on the Board of AVID Technologies, a NASDAQ-listed company.\n\nU.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn was sworn in to the Senate in January 2019.\n\nMarsha Blackburn was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2018, and is currently serving her first term representing the state of Tennessee. Before her election to the Senate, Marsha represented Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District.\n\nMarsha’s public service is dedicated to promoting opportunities for women and making America a more prosperous place to live. Marsha’s leadership philosophy is based on her experiences in the private sector as a small business woman and author, as well as being a mother and grandmother.\n\nMarsha went to college on a 4-H scholarship and worked her way through school selling books for the Southwestern Company as one of their first female sales associates, and later as one of their first female sales managers.\n\nShe then became Director of Retail Fashion and Special Events for the Castner Knott Company, which was a Nashville-based regional department store. Later, Marsha founded her own business, Marketing Strategies, which focused on the retail marketplace, as well as electronic and print media.\n\nMarsha began her career in public service in 1995 when she was named executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission. In 1998, she was elected to the Tennessee State Senate. In the state legislature, she earned a reputation for fiscal responsibility and government accountability by identifying waste and offering realistic solutions to Tennessee’s budget challenges.\n\nWhile serving in the Tennessee Senate, Marsha led a statewide grassroots campaign to defeat a proposed state income tax. The tax was defeated, and Marsha’s leadership earned her a reputation as an anti-tax champion. In 2014, the people of Tennessee passed an amendment to the state constitution to expressly prohibit a state income tax – a fitting cap to a 14-year battle.\n\nIn 2002, Marsha was elected to represent the people of Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District based on her record in the state legislature. She brought her Tennessee values to Washington, DC, and became a leader in the fight for small, efficient federal government that is accountable to its citizens. As a Congressman, Marsha was often selected by her colleagues to lead the charge for principled conservativism. Her congressional career was also noted for her Chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, as well as bipartisan expertise in defending songwriters’ and performers’ rights.\n\nMarsha is a member of numerous charitable organizations and is an active member of her church, Christ Presbyterian. Marsha and her husband Chuck live in Williamson County, Tennessee. They have two children, Mary Morgan (Paul) Ketchel and Chad (Hillary) Blackburn, two grandsons, and a granddaughter. Originally from Laurel, Mississippi, Marsha is a graduate of Mississippi State University.\n\nPeter E.

Blacker led the Revenue Strategy and Distribution division, focusing on the commercialization, monetization and distribution of Telemundo content for SVOD and AVOD platforms in the US and Globally.\n\nBlacker began his tenure at NBCUniversal launching one of the company’s first forays in Digital Media developing Telemundo’s Digital, Social and Mobile business units, which he managed for over a decade and growing them into an award-winning powerhouse. His pioneering work in English and Spanish spanned multiple genres including developing interactive primetime programming with Telemundo Studios, multiple US Election’s coverage on digital platforms, record breaking digital and social experiences for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as well as launching NBCU’s first bilingual multiplatform global entertainment news program LATINX Now!\n\nAdditionally Blacker developed Telemundo’s bilingual movie studio, FLUENCY, whose award-wining productions led him to be tapped to be an Executive Producer for Telemundo Global Studios where he worked closely with the content development teams, connecting storytelling and technology to maximize the audience and revenue potential of Telemundo intellectual property. Blacker also led Telemundo’s first distribution and partnership agreements with Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon for the US and Global markets.\n\nPrior to joining NBCUniversal, Blacker served as Vice President, Multicultural & International for AOL Media Networks. There he created AOL’s first marketing, sales and research strategies for the U.S. multicultural market and assisted the development of AOL Latino, AOL BlackVoices, AOL Japan, AOL Germany and AOL Latin America.\n\nIn 2021, Blacker was one of 30 senior revenue, advertising and tech executives to be included in Variety’s Valleywood Impact Report and has won multiple awards for his pioneering work over the past 20 years. A strong believer in the importance of education and community service, Blacker is on the National Board of the Posse Foundation and has been the Chairman of Posse Miami for over a decade. He is a graduate of Cornell University and speaks both Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nDavid Cohen joined IAB in April 2020 as President and was named Chief Executive Officer in September 2020. Cohen is a widely respected advertising agency leader who, prior to IAB, served as President, North America for MAGNA, Interpublic Group’s (IPG) centralized media intelligence, investment, and innovation arm.
