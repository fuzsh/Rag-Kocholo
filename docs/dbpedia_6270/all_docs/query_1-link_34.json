        "text": "A career in Hollywood is always an up-and-down proposition. One day you’re winning the Oscar, the next you’re starring in a straight-to-video flick.\n\nNicolas Cage is one of those actors who started his career strong but of late has become a punch line, appearing in a string of crappy action flicks, such as 2012’s “Stolen.”\n\nBut on Friday, what would appear to be his bid for respectability arrives in the form of “Joe.” The 50-year-old is already getting some of the best reviews of his recent career for playing a grizzled ex-con who befriends a teen boy (Tye Sheridan) with an abusive father (Gary Poulter).\n\nSeeing Cage in a spare indie drama will shock those who are used to watching the actor in nothing but films that look like ones John Cena turned down. Over the past 15 years or so, he has earned the rep of being a paycheck actor: Andy Samberg’s “Saturday Night Live” impersonation of Cage mainly consisted of the punch line “How am I not in that movie?!”\n\nNot that there’s anything wrong with that. As Michael Caine once said of his own movie “Jaws: The Revenge,” “I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.”\n\nCage, who won an Oscar for 1995’s “Leaving Las Vegas,” says he doesn’t chase awards or money. He signs up for movies, including those in the fantasy, horror and sci-fi arenas, because he’s a fan of those genres and they allow him to turn in a more “avant-garde” performance. He agreed to do the 2011 bomb “Drive Angry” simply because he thought it was cool that his character would get shot in the eye.\n\nLet’s look at the respectability index (1 being the lowest, 10 being the highest) for Cage through the years, as well as for four others whose careers have been up and down.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\n1987, “Raising Arizona”\n\nRating: 8\n\nQuirky Coen Brothers goodness.
