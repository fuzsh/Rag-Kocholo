        "text": "Animation\n\nThe Case of Adventure Time\n\nThis week we are continuing Adventure August with a special guest: Robin’s sister, Becky! This week, we’re covering a show that is near and dear to Becky’s heart, and we thought she might enjoy geeking out with us.\n\nThe late 2000’s was not the brightest spot in Cartoon Network’s history. The channel had begun to branch out, incorporating live-action shows into its programming in an attempt to compete with other kids’ networks. By July of 2009, this endeavor appeared fruitless, as almost none of the live-action shows proved to have any staying power. The network scrapped their block of live-action and started looking for new ideas.\n\nIn April of 2010, Cartoon Network premiered a new animated series that would quickly become one of their most prominent properties. It followed the adventures of two best friends/brothers, a human named Finn and a dog named Jake. Together, they explored the magical land of Ooo, rescuing princesses, making friends, and going on various adventures.\n\nAdventure Time was strange and refreshing. Its world was rich with indescribably odd characters and yet completely relatable. Its themes were complex and sometimes dark, with a brightly colored coat of paint and enough humor to appeal to all audiences. It was a show that took the world by storm, knocking down barriers and opening doors for other off-beat animation for years to come.\n\nSo this week, we’re meeting up with Finn and Jake in the Land of Ooo. Come on, grab your friends…because we all know what time it is! It’s Adventure Time!\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAdventure Time centers around Jake the Dog and Finn the Human who, as the title suggests, go on adventures together. In these post apocalyptic adventures they fight evil, protect their friends, make new friends, and learn lessons.\n\nMEET THE CREATOR\n\nPendleton Ward has always been an introvert. In a 2014 Rolling Stone article, he detailed his experiences as an awkward, overweight child with a bowl cut. He never knew his dad but was raised by his mother, an artist that nurtured Ward’s creativity.\n\nBecause he had difficulty understanding people, young Ward would take notes on the people he knew, trying to make sense of the characters around him. He loved Dungeons and Dragons and would roller-skate down to the comic shop. He felt like an outcast among outcasts.\n\nWhen Ward attended CalArts, one of the top animation schools in the country, he found a group of peers that would become friends and collaborators. One of these friends was Adam Muto, a classmate and fellow artist who would join Ward on the biggest project of his lifetime.\n\nIn the mid-2000’s, CalArts accepted one of Ward’s animated shorts into an end-of-the-year show called “The Producers Show.” Frederator, an independent animation studio that created TV shows like “The Fairly Odd Parents” and “My Life as a Teenage Robot,” was impressed by Ward’s work. At the time, the studio was accepting pitches for short films. They needed ideas to fill a Nickelodeon block of animated shorts, and they were taking pitches from anyone–even animators without experience or representation.\n\nWard threw together a storyboard for a 7-minute short called “Adventure Time,” which followed the characters Pen and Jake, a human and dog that were best friends. The short made its way to Nickelodeon in 2007, which later broadcasted it in 2008 on the anthology show “Random! Cartoons.” Watch part of it here: Adventure Time Pilot (Nicktoons)\n\nIt was directed by Larry Leichliter, Hugo Morales, and Pendleton Ward. Adventure Time (2008) starred a group of actors that would eventually be replaced, except for John DiMaggio as Jake the Dog. John Kassir played the Ice King, and we might remember him as the voice of the Crypt Keeper.\n\nInitially, the short didn’t make a considerable impact commercially, but it earned a nomination for Best Animated Short Subject at the Annie Awards! Because of this, the short had to be available to watch online and was published on YouTube. Although the animated short didn’t win the Annie, something else incredible happened: it went viral.\n\nAs the video racked up over 3 million views online, it became clear that it had a far-reaching appeal. Frederator Studios decided to start pitching the show. Pendleton Ward found all of this exciting, but as he told Rolling Stone, “If the show hadn’t been picked up, I would have moved to the Midwest and gotten a cheap apartment. I would have been that guy with a telescope watching my neighbors, getting pizza and putting a sign on the door that says ‘Leave the pizza outside.'”\n\nTHE TROUBLESOME BEGINNINGS AND MAKING OF ADVENTURE TIME\n\nAfter creating the original Adventure Time short, Pendleton Ward spent a year writing and creating storyboards for a Cartoon Network show called, “The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack.” Years later, he would credit this experience with teaching him how to run an animated series.\n\nWard and Frederator pitched a full Adventure Time series to Nicktoons, and were reportedly rejected 5 times. Once Nickelodeon no longer had the rights to produce the series, Frederator producer Frank Seibert brought the concept to Cartoon Network.\n\nAs Ward admitted in an interview with Fastcompany.com, it’s a huge risk for a network to put money behind an original idea. Usually, studios like to pick up established properties that have proven to do well, and Adventure Time was a hard-sell in general. In a sense, the show was very open-ended. It was simply about two best friends just having adventures, and there wasn’t much of a hook.\n\nLuckily for Seibert and Ward, Cartoon Network was interested in producing a full series. However, they would only commit to a deal if Ward could prove the short “wasn’t a one-hit wonder”. Cartoon Network asked Ward to submit a sample script for their consideration, but the vice president of Frederator, Eric Homan, convinced Ward to play to his strengths, and create a storyboard instead.\n\nWard turned to his friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto, and they began developing ideas. For years after, Ward would explain that the characters he and his co-writers created weren’t just characters. Finn, Jake, and all the others were extensions of the writers themselves, and the people that Ward chose to work with were the heart and soul of the show.\n\nThe group’s first storyboard featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date, but Cartoon Network was disinterested in the idea. It was clear that Ward and his team needed to recreate the magic of the original short. So Ward, McHale, and Muto created a storyboard for the episode “The Enchiridion!”, which was their attempt to consciously emulate the style of the original “Adventure Time.” This tactic proved successful, and Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, with “The Enchiridion!” as the first episode to enter into production.\n\nJust as Ward and his team began storyboarding more episodes, Cartoon Network once again became concerned about the direction of the series. Because Adventure Time was one of the only new animated shows on the network, they needed to ensure its success. Compared to other animators, Ward and his colleagues were fairly inexperienced, and production became a little hectic. One issue was finding the right team of animators to work in Ward’s unique and simplistic style. Also, the writers still hadn’t landed on a clear vision of the show.\n\nCartoon Network put production on hold, and hired three veteran animators who had worked on SpongeBob SquarePants. Derek Drymon, who served as executive producer for the first season of Adventure Time, Merriwether Williams, who served as head story editor for the show’s first and second seasons, and Nick Jennings who became the series’ long-serving art director. The team added artists like Phil Rydna and Dan “Ghostshrimp” Bandit, two animators that were instrumental in getting the show off the ground as they were able to draw in Ward’s style. Derek Dryman was able to help the production team storyboard a new episode called “Prisoners of Love,” that would finally ease the anxieties of the network. Four long years after the original short, the show finally premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010.\n\nSHOW PRODUCTION\n\nGrowing up, Ward was a big fan of Dungeons & Dragons and The Simpsons. He was able to combine the two to make Adventure Time. Ward told The A.V. Club that the show’s writing process usually began with the writers telling each other what they had done the previous week to find something to build on. He has compared the writing process to creating D & D characters, and playing them in that universe. To Ward and the other writers, they were just animating the campaigns of their assigned characters each week.\n\nAdventure Time was produced using hand-drawn animation. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on at the same time. After the crew got a storyboard approved by Cartoon Network, the board was then worked into a script for the voice actors. The recorded dialogue was then placed under the polished storyboard panels, making a rough cut for the episode that the animators could follow. Then, character and prop designers would meet to see what needed to be designed for the episode. After the design phase, the animation was outsourced to South Korea. The animation was largely hand-drawn, and then scanned into the computer. Once it was completed, the American team looked over the episode for errors, sometimes making minor changes at the last second.\n\nPen Ward kept an open mind as the showrunner. He would often let his team contribute their own ideas and stories while keeping control of the show overall.\n\nAfter four and a half successful seasons, Ward decided it was time to step down as showrunner. Although he stayed to contribute every now and then or look over stories, he felt it best for his personal health and wellbeing to step away. The pressures of controlling a massively popular show became too much for his introverted personality. He handed the reins to Adam Muto, his college buddy that helped him develop the show.\n\nWhen Muto took over, the show went in a different direction. Although the show never lost its sense of whimsy, the tone shifted to be more introspective. There were more series’ of episodes, rather than one-off adventures, and the plots became even more complex.\n\nIn an article for the LA Times Rebecca Sugar talked about what it was like working on the show, especially the finale. She said, “I wrote a song for the finale called “Time Adventure.” I wanted to write about how even if something ends, it continues to exist in the past, nothing ever really goes away, you only feel like it does because our mind has to process information one moment at a time in order for us to function as humans. I’m so nostalgic for the time that I spent working on “Adventure Time” and I find it comforting to think that I still exist in that office with Adam, working on those stories. I would be so happy to come to work and brainstorm with him and sit down and draw on paper and pitch these stories with Post-its tacked up to the wall, just like they did in the 1930s with the stick and the song and the dance, the most traditional way of doing cartoons.”\n\nCAST\n\nIn order to create dialogue that would naturally flow between the characters, Adventure Time preferred recording as a group under the direction of Kent Osbourne.\n\nHynden Walch, who voices Princess Bubblegum, said in a Comic Con interview that, “It’s just like doing a play reading—a really, really out there play.”\n\nIn order to bring some variety into the voice acting, the team has employed many actors for small roles within the show. Some actors were reached out to but others were fans of the show and asked to be a part of it! In an interview at the 2014 San Diego Comic Con Adam Muto and Kent Osborne remarked that they had a strange goal of getting all the actors from Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Office to voice recurring and minor roles. Kent made it clear though that when someone like Rainn Wilson had asked to guest star, they did not immediately put him in. They have a list of actors that have contacted them and when a character arises that would fit their voice they are brought in.\n\nSTARRING\n\nVoice actors typically voice more than one character and so we will mention the main character that the actors voices but know that they voiced several others throughout the series.\n\nJohn DiMaggio as Jake\n\nHe is also known as Bender in Futurama.\n\nIn Paul Thomas’ “Exploring the Land of Ooo,” John DiMaggio is quoted saying, “I was trying to figure out from the beginning what the big deal was. I was like, ‘I’m not sure I understand what’s going on here.’ … You just had these lines that said whatever, and it was like, ‘I don’t get it.’ I said to Tom Kenny once, I was like, ‘Dude, I don’t get this show at all. I have no idea.’ And he was like, ‘Listen, man. Just trust me. This is this generation’s Yellow Submarine. Just leave it at that.’ And he was right. The art direction on the show, the whole world is great—the Land of Ooo is just weird. … It’s just a weird thing, you know. I love doing the show. It’s fun as hell.”\n\nJeremy Shada as Finn\n\nJeremy is Reggie in Julie and the Phantoms!\n\nThe character of Finn was originally inspired by another animation by Pen Ward called Bueno the Bear. You can easily see how the style carried over to Adventure Time.\n\nBueno the Bear\n\nJeremy’s older brother Zach was the original voice of Finn\n\nTom Kenny as Ice King\n\nWe all of course know Tom Kenny but in case you are not aware he is Spongebob!\n\nHynden Walch as Princess Bubblegum\n\nHynden often voices Starfire in the Teen Titans shows.\n\nBubblegum was one of the first characters created for the show and was originally named Bettie after Ward’s mother.\n\nOlivia Olson as Marceline the Vampire Queen\n\nShe has been voices in other shows such as Phineas and Ferb, also played Joanna Anderson in “Love Actually”, but is best known for Adventure Time\n\nWard got the idea for Marceline from a childhood friend!\n\nNikki Yang as BMO\n\nShe also voices Candy Chiu in Gravity Falls.\n\nPendleton Ward as Lumpy Space Princess\n\nHe works on many Cartoon Network Studios projects as a screenwriter, animator, voice actor, etc.\n\nRUNNING JOKES/ GAGS\n\nSnail in every episode\n\nExcluding the very first episode and a few others, the snail can be found within each episode. His appearance becomes a running gag as the seasons go on. He is even possessed by The Lich in a few episodes and can be seen with green eyes and an evil appearing expression.\n\nIce King kidnapping princesses\n\nMany Fans believe that the Ice King is obsessed with Princesses because his human form, (Simon Petrikov) before becoming the ice king, had a fiancee named Betty. He would often call her princess. This leads those to believe that he is trying to find his princess or at least replace the love that he has lost.\n\nSquirrel that hates Jake\n\nHis most famous words to Jake, “You son of a Bleep, Blop!”\n\nShelby the worm that lives in Jake’s viola\n\nHis voice is created by altering Pen Ward’s! He is also specifically labeled as a male earthworm even though earthworms are in fact hermaphrodites.\n\nFinn being able to sing with auto-tune\n\nWe do not get to see in the show how Finn is able to sing auto-tune, but he says that when he was younger he swallowed a little computer.\n\nPeppermint Butler being secretly evil\n\nPeppermint Butler is Princess Bubblegum’s trusted butler, advisor, and friend. Throughout the series many instances show how he may have a dark side and past that is unbeknownst to the citizens of the candy kingdom. With this dark side he never turns on Princess Bubblegum and stays by her side making sure she is safe.\n\nThe hints at Ooo being in a post apocalypse (Business Time)\n\nAdventure Time is set in The Land of Ooo. The land of Ooo began as just a magical land but in the first season it quickly began to have a history emerge. This history does not become the main focus but rather a background to the main characters and their stories.\n\nIn a USA Today article Ward said, “I never planned it – I just saw this world as a magical place. The show developed organically – someone would add an element to the world, and it would stick. At some point, we did an episode about businessmen rising up from an iceberg at the bottom of a lake (“Business Time”) and that made the world post-apocalyptic, and we just ran with it.”\n\nFAVORITE EPISODES\n\nWizard – Season 1, Episode 11\n\nDungeon – Season 1, Episode 18\n\nRainy Day Daydream – Season 1, Episode 23\n\nThe Other Tarts – Season 2, Episode 9\n\n“What was Missing” Season 3, Episode 10\n\nIt is the genuine band episode\n\nThis episode is famous for deepening the relationship between Bubblegum and Marceline. After reading the episode, storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar suggested to Adam Muto that Bubblegum and Marceline had been in a romantic relationship that had gone south, which explains their complicated interactions and the cryptic lines of Marceline’s song. The show liked the idea, but knew that they had to approach it in a very subtextual way. Still, audiences understood what the writers were going for, and the episode sparked some controversy among the fanbase.\n\nSeveral seasons later in 2018, Cartoon Network aired the final episode which confirmed the relationship.\n\nJake vs. Me-Mow – Season 3, Episode 16\n\nThis is a fan favorite because people love Me-Mow.\n\nI Remember You – Season 4, Episode 25\n\nThe Lich – Season 4 finale\n\nA big turning point for the show and first appearance of Prismo.\n\nAWARDS/ RECEPTION\n\nAlthough on first look Adventure Time seems to be for children, it has garnered an audience from a wide range of ages. Many teenagers and even adults relate to its offbeat humor and characters. This has caused some of its episodes to obtain over three million views! It paved the way for Cartoon Network after its failed attempts to compete with live action shows.\n\nAdventure Time has won several awards which include eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, two British Academy Children’s Awards, two Behind the Voice Actors Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. It has been nominated for many others as well.\n\nThe series was so popular that lots of merch has been made which includes books, video games, clothing, and more.\n\nThe original series ended in 2018 but with it’s popularity still big, HBO brought it back in 2020. Adventure Time: Distant Lands has three episodes with a fourth on the way. The 42 minute specials explore new and distant worlds based on the universe that Pendleton Ward created.\n\nINDUSTRY IMPACT\n\nOne example of Adventure Time’s positive impact is the continued careers and success of its crew. Many of the people that worked on the show went on to produce their own shows which include Over the Garden Wall, Steven Universe, OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, and City of Ghosts.\n\nAdventure Time brought in a new era for cartoons where artists could come together and create a series without holding back. It has inspired countless shows after it with its storyline and animation style. Adventure Time demonstrated that independent artists could not only animate but create interesting and successful stories.\n\nFinn and Jake are so big that they are also now included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade!\n\nIn the late 2000s, Cartoon Network took a big risk, and boy did it pay off. In a world already overwhelmed with remakes and revivals, they decided to take a different path; a unique path; a weird path. Adventure Time is one of the most important animated shows of the 2010s. It not only gained an unbelievable cult following, it ushered in a new era of animation for Cartoon Network and even some other animation giants. But putting the needs of big studios aside, it’s a show that likely inspired other animators, proving that success isn’t out of reach–even for the weirdos. Adventure Time is out there, and that’s what makes it special. Its humor is off-beat, and not everyone will understand it all the time, but every moment is understood by someone. So, if you’re in the mood for an adventure, go check out the land of Ooo. The fun never ends.\n\nBefore we go, we’d like to thank our Patrons!

But even though his live-action achievements are well-known, his contributions to the animation world might be overlooked from time to time.\n\nSpielberg’s love of animation drove him to collaborate with Don Bluth on movies like The Land Before Time and An American Tail, beloved classics that are likely still enjoyed at grandparents’ houses all over America. But the director wanted to do more with the medium. So, he teamed up with Universal Pictures to create his own animation studio: Amblimation.\n\nThis week, we’re taking a look at the short-lived history of this defunct studio, and its three films. Amblimation may not have lasted long, but its movies will live forever in the hearts of viewers everywhere.\n\nIn 1981, only 6 years after Jaws took a huge bite out of box office numbers, Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, and Frank Marshall launched their own film production company, Amblin. Its logo would later become the iconic image of Elliot flying with ET over the full moon.\n\nUnder Amblin, Spielberg teamed up with Don Bluth to create the highest grossing non-Disney animated film of the time: An American Tail. The movie even beat Disney’s The Great Mouse Detective in box office numbers, and proved that Spielberg could be successful in animation as well as live action.\n\nAn American Tail tells the story of Fievel Mousekewitz and his family as they emigrate from the Imperial Russian territory of Ukraine to the United States for freedom.\n\nAmblin continued to work with Bluth, creating the childhood classic The Land Before Time. This film was also a major success, prompting many sequels. If these two films weren’t enough of an indication that Spielberg could succeed as an animation producer, it was the wildly successful Who Framed Roger Rabbit that really sealed the deal. The hybrid animation/live-action film drew in massive crowds, beating out the box office numbers for the previously mentioned films.\n\nSpielberg wanted to continue to work with Bluth, and had ideas for An American Tail sequel. Bluth reportedly turned him down, as he didn’t like the lack of creative control he had had with the other two films. So in 1989, Spielberg made his own animation studio with Universal Pictures. He based the studio in the UK, and sought out animators outside the United States. Walt Disney Animation essentially had a monopoly on all the best animators at the time, except of course the team at Don Bluth (which Spielberg wasn’t about to try and poach). It would be difficult to convince someone with a job at the most historically successful animation studio to jump on a new and uncertain venture.\n\nOnce Spielberg had his team, they set to work on their first feature film, An American Tail: Fievel Goes West.\n\nAN AMERICAN TAIL: FIEVEL GOES WEST (NOVEMBER 22, 1991)\n\nDon Bluth has a unique animation style that can be imitated, but not replicated. He was noticeably absent from the second installment of the “American Tail” franchise, so Fievel Goes West had a different tone and animation style from its predecessor.\n\nWhen asked about it in an interview, director Phil Nibbelink said, “Don Bluth made a beautiful movie with American Tail. We tried to live up to it and go beyond it. We would never be able to match Don Bluth’s style. He had such a distinct style. We had a completely different set of artists. It forced us to go in a different direction.”\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nFievel is up to his old tricks as the family moves out west for a better life, as New York is not the catless dream they expected it to be. They are once again deceived by a smooth talking cat, that plans on exploiting the labor of the mice and eventually turning them into “mouse burgers.” (Ew.) But, luckily their old cat pal Tiger has followed them to Green River, and will help them face off against the evil Cat R Wahl.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nThis film was directed by Simon Wells and former Disney animator Phil Nibbelink.\n\nLike we said before, Spielberg had to go to Europe to find more animators to fill his team. He built a production crew of 280 people, 120 of them were animators. The rest were ink and paint, background artists, layout artists, etc.\n\nAll voices for the film were recorded before animation, which is a common film practice. Usually, voices are recorded after the storyboard process, but before the animation. This ensures that animators don’t draw extra scenes that end up not working, and they can hear exactly how the characters will speak as they draw.\n\nSpielberg wanted the movie to have a live-action cinematic quality to it. He pushed for the animation to not have very many cuts. He wanted the animators to save that for building tension. For most of it he wanted a moving camera, and this meant that animators had to draw really long backgrounds so they could keep the shots moving. The movie relies heavily on its western setting, and this technique helped establish that.\n\nThe background was watercolor underneath, and artists used pastel, crayon, and a little bit of airbrush to create depth!\n\nAnimators also worked with a variety of angles, which was not common in animation.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe music was composed by James Horner but the film does feature the song Rawhide from the movie “The Blues Brothers” in which Spielberg cameoed in!\n\nSTARRING\n\nPhillip Glasser returned to lend his voice as Fievel\n\nHe is an actor and producer known for The Illusionist and Agent Cody Banks.\n\nVeteran film actor James Stewart plays the heroic Wylie Burp!\n\nHe is known for Anatomy of a Murder, Vertigo, The Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and fittingly, How the West Was Won\n\nThis was his final film credit before his death in 1992.\n\nErica Yohn as Mama\n\nShe has been in Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure, The Godfather: Part II, and Corrina Corrina.\n\nCathy Cavadini as Tanya\n\nShe is best known as Blossom in the Powerpuff Girls.\n\nNehemiah as Persoff\n\nHe has been in Some Like It Hot, Twins, and The Wrong Man.\n\nDom Deluise as Tiger\n\nHe is known for All Dogs Go to Heaven, Blazing Saddles, and The Secret of NIMH.\n\nAmy Irving as Miss Kitty\n\nShe has been in Traffic, Adam, Carrie, and Crossing Delancey.\n\nJohn Cleese as Cat R. Waul\n\nJohn Cleese is known for Monty Python and A Fish Called Wanda.\n\nFun fact- He turned down Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast for this role! Which is especially interesting because the two movies released the same day.\n\nJon Lovitz as Chula\n\nHe has been in A League of Their Own, Happiness, Rat Race, and Loaded Weapon 1.\n\nRECEPTION/IMPACT/AWARDS\n\nAlthough it did not win anything it was nominated at the 1992 Golden Globes for Best Original Song for “Dreams to Dream.” The music was by James Horner with lyrics by Will Jennings.\n\nIt grossed about $40,766,041 worldwide. Alternatively, Beauty and the Beast, which released on the same day, was the first animated movie to reach 100 million dollars in its first run.\n\nIn order to maintain a consistent release schedule with their movies, Amblimation worked on all three of its projects simultaneously. Originally, the next feature planned was an animated version of the musical Cats. But as that ran into problems, the studio focused on releasing another film, based on Hudson Talbott’s book, “We’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story.”\n\nWE’RE BACK! A DINOSAUR’S STORY (NOVEMBER 24, 1993)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nCaptain Neweyes travels back in time and feeds dinosaurs his Brain Grain cereal, which makes them intelligent and nonviolent. They agree to go to the future in order to grant the wishes of children in New York city. Their plan is to meet Dr. Bleeb of the Museum of Natural History, but they get side-tracked with some new friends and later run into the Captain’s evil brother, Professor Screweyes, who has other plans for the dinosaurs.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nHanna-Barbera was the first company to contact Hudson Talbott about obtaining rights to his book We’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story (1987), only months after its release. It may sound funny to hear of the “Scooby Doo” animators making full-length films, but they produced some great animation, like the 1973 version of “Charlotte’s Web.” Universal Pictures then paid off Hanna-Barbera and purchased the rights for Spielberg to produce the film.\n\nThe film was directed by Phil Nibbelink and Simon Wells, who also directed Fievel Goes West!\n\nAlthough Talbott had little involvement, he had many encounters with the creators of the film during production, including Spielberg who would make several calls to the author.\n\nStoryboarding of We’re Back started in 1990 during the production of Fievel Goes West. The first screenplay draft was written by Flint Dille and the film’s director Simon Wells. But, the initial script was not well received by Spielberg, and he hired John Patrick Shanley to write another draft, which was done quickly and ultimately used.\n\nThe book was only 20 pages and lacked any antagonist or any major plot points, making it difficult to adapt. Talbott felt the film had none of the tongue-in-cheek humor that he wrote in his book, so the voice actors changed a few lines while recording. However, this was not approved by Shanley, so his original lines were used in the final film.\n\nAnd funny side note; John Goodman started recording his part just shortly after having his wisdom teeth removed!\n\nWhile Amblimation was working on the film, Spielberg secured the rights to Michael Crichton’s book, Jurassic Park. The animators knew that even though they had been working on the animation for years, the films would likely release around the same time. When Nibbelink saw the ILM’s computer work for Jurassic Park, he said he knew that the film would be a game-changer. There’s no doubt it overshadowed “We’re Back” as the best Dinosaur film of the year, probably decade, maybe even century?\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe music for all the Amblimation films was done by James Horner. His work is the emotional cornerstone of “We’re Back,” as the movie can be quite silly.\n\nHorner wrote the melody to, “Roll Back the Rock,” with lyrics by Thomas Dolby. Horner proved time and time again that he was a talented songwriter, and Spielberg utilized that to great effect.\n\nSTARRING\n\nJohn Goodman as Rex\n\nHe is known for things like Roseanne, The Big Lebowski, and Monsters Inc.\n\nBlaze Berdahl as Buster\n\nShe has been in the 1989 Pet Sematary and the show Ghostwriter.\n\nRhea Perlman as Mother Bird\n\nShe is most known for being in Matilda, and the shows Cheers and Taxi.\n\nJay Leno as Vorb\n\nHe is of course known for being a big tv personality for The Jay Leno Show and The Tonight Show.\n\nRené Le Vant as Woog\n\nHe has been in Rocky II and the 1977 The Incredible Hulk.\n\nFelicity Kendal as Elsa\n\nShe has been in things like Good Neighbors, Valentino, and Parting Shots.\n\nCharles Fleischer as Dweeb\n\nHe is known for movies such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Zodiac, and A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nWalter Cronkite as Captain Naweyes\n\nHe was a news reporter and journalist who lended his voice to just a few movies and shows.\n\nJulia Child as Dr. Bleeb\n\nThis movie was her only acting role as she is most known for her cooking and cook books.\n\nKenneth Mars as Professor Screweyes\n\nHe is known for Young Frankenstein, The Producers (1967), and The Little Mermaid.\n\nYeardley Smith as Cecilia\n\nShe is Lisa and other characters in The Simpsons. She was also in Maximum Overdrive and As Good As It Gets.\n\nMartin Short as Stubbs the Clown\n\nHe has been in Father of the Bride, Three Amigos!, and Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.\n\nRECEPTION/IMPACT/AWARDS\n\nWe’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story released during the start of an economic downturn for animated features in the early 1990s. It opened during the Thanksgiving holiday with other new entries including Mrs. Doubtfire, A Perfect World, and a film adaptation of The Nutcracker. It grossed $3.7 million on its opening weekend and ended with a total gross of $9 million in the United States. The film was generally considered to be a poor performer, and it was the highest grossing children’s film of its opening weekend only because it was a poor weekend for the genre.\n\nBy the mid 1990’s, animation wasn’t lucrative for anyone except Disney. Other studios were struggling to make films that competed with what would be later known as The Disney Renaissance. In an LA Times article dated January, 1994, an anonymous Disney animator was quoted saying, “Animation–even bad animation–is a lot of work, and if you do that much work, you want people to see it, but the reality of the situation is that people won’t go see it unless it’s a Disney film.”\n\nWe’re Back was considered a flop, and certainly had its problems. But, after its video release, more fans were drawn to the wacky storyline, mysterious villain, and John Goodman’s stellar performance as Rex. The components of a good animated film were there. In 1990, producer David Kirschner expressed concern that studios would start releasing films that weren’t quite ready for consumers, in an attempt to push forward with an animation renaissance. His worries proved valid, as more animated projects seemed to flounder throughout the 90’s.\n\nAfter Amblimation’s second flop, it pushed forward to release its third, and ultimately final film, “Balto.” If you grew up in the 90’s, you might think of Balto as a success, as it seemed to constantly air on TV and in waiting rooms at the pediatrician’s office. Unfortunately, the popularity of the film didn’t manifest until after it was in theaters.\n\nBALTO (DECEMBER 22, 1995)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story about a sled dog team that helped save children infected with diphtheria in 1925, by performing a serum run to Nome, Alaska. The movie focuses on a dynamic main protagonist, Balto, who is part wolf and Siberian Husky. Despite the challenges that Balto faces as a social outcast, he ends up taking charge and leading the team on the treacherous journey to Nome, saving the children in the process. https://www.youtube.com/embed/ucfHDO4k9gM?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nIt is a 1995 animated adventure film directed by Simon Wells, produced by Amblimation and distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nWriter Elana Lesser recollected being told the story of Balto by her grandfather when she was younger and as an adult thought it would be a beautiful animated feature. She and writer, Cliff Ruby, pitched the idea to Amblin with their screenplay in tow. It was then relayed to Phil Nibbelink and Simon Wells.\n\nDirector Simon Wells had to heavily persuade Steven Spielberg to make this story. It was close to his heart and he felt it needed to be told. It was a tough sell as Spielberg was apprehensive of a movie that he felt would not be colorful enough. In order to quell these fears Wells showed him dozens of small color studies done by the production designer Hans Bacher. They proved that the movie would not be solely black and white dogs on a desolate background. It ended up being Simon Wells’ first solo directed movie, as Nibbelink would leave the project to return to working on We’re Back. David Cohen and Roger Schulman would fine tune the story into the final screenplay that would be accepted.\n\nSince the budget was tight, a lot of tough decisions had to be made. An example of this would be that they would have to choose between either shadows or footprints in the snow. In the typical shot they could not afford both so they would try to figure out what they could get away with not having or showing.\n\nIn order for the voice actors to get a sense of the characters they were portraying, several model sheets were drawn up for the actors to look at. These sheets were done in the early years of development and would show different aspects of the character-like facial expressions, movement, and size comparisons.\n\nThe team brought in 7 siberian huskies to study! They were used among many other references in order to get look and character movement correct.\n\nWhen asked about the decision not to reveal the identity of the white wolf, Wells said “We wanted to keep it mystical and vague – is this a real event or is it some kind of hallucination that Balto is experiencing? All of these were reasons to not have the White Wolf speak or in any way explain himself. Perhaps the Wolf is a manifestation of Balto’s inner voice, telling him to take ownership and use that part of him that he has always been ashamed of – certainly that is the message Balto takes from the encounter, real or not.”\n\nUnfortunately the morse code used within the movie is just gibberish with no hidden easter eggs.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe music was once again composed by James Horner. Wells said that, “James preferred to present his score as the orchestral finished product, and make alterations based on notes from that finished product…”\n\nThis process made sense because Horner was in California while the rest of the cast and crew was in the United Kingdom\n\nBalto is considered to be Horner’s best Amblimation score, with beautiful and enchanting music that remains one of the best features of the film.\n\nCASTING\n\nKevin Bacon as Balto\n\nHe is known for Footloose, Tremors, and Mystic River.\n\nBob Hoskins as Boris\n\nHe was in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Long Good Friday, and Unleashed.\n\nBridget Fonda as Jenna\n\nShe is in A Simple Plan, Point of No Return, and Single White Female.\n\nJim Cummings as Steele\n\nHe has been in Princess and the Frog, Aladdin, and the 2018 Christopher Robin.\n\nPhil Collins as Muk and Luk\n\nHe is a music composer, that we all know. Tarzan, etc.\n\nJuliette Brewer as Rosy\n\nShe was also in The Little Rascals and Vegas Vacation.\n\nRECEPTION/IMPACT/AWARDS\n\nThe film earned over $11 million at the domestic box office.\n\nIt was forced to compete with classics like Jumanji and Toy Story, which absolutely destroyed Balto in terms of numbers.\n\nIt was nominated for the Young Artists Award for Best Family Feature – Musical or Comedy and three different Annie Awards. Unfortunately it did not take any wins home.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO AMBLIMATION?\n\nWhen Balto opened, it only earned 1.5 million dollars opening weekend. It was in 15th place, and even though it seems to be the most well-known and successful of Amblimation’s films, its failure to draw in crowds seemed to be the nail in the coffin for the studio.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to release a new film every year. The fourth feature in the making was an animated version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats.”\n\nThe film was to be set during the London blitz, with traditionally animated characters set against 3D miniature sets. The art style was inspired by German expressionism. Animator Hans Bacher said he roamed the “ugliest” parts of London to take reference photos, and the team had been working on the project since they had wrapped “Fievel Goes West.”\n\nOf course, this version of “Cats” never came to be. There were disagreements about the screenplay, and production stopped after 6 months. The studio moved on to the other two films that it produced. When Spielberg relocated the studio to California, a new team started work on the project. But, it eventually stopped and Amblimation folded in 1997.\n\nSince Amblimation was gone, Universal bought the rights to the play. And well…we know how that story ends. Imagine if Amblimation had held on for just a few more years, we would have an entirely different version of cats than the monstrosity that clawed its way into our collective psyche in 2019.\n\nNow, you could say that Amblimation never REALLY disappeared. After the devastating box office loss for Balto, Spielberg saw the writing on the wall, and shifted his attention to a new venture.\n\nThroughout the early and mid-90’s, Amblimation was attempting to compete against the Disney machine. Like we said before, this was the Disney Renaissance. Fievel Goes West was overshadowed by Beauty and the Beast. By 1994, audiences were only gambling their movie money on Disney animation. And when Balto hit theaters, it stood against the first ever full-length computer animated film.\n\nThings didn’t seem to be slowing down for the animation giant, but in 1994, the company lost its president, Frank Wells, in a tragic helicopter crash. The death sent shock waves through the institution, and prompted the resignation of one of the architects of the Disney Renaissance: Jeffrey Katzenburg.\n\nKatzenburg had struggled with Disney’s CEO Michael Eisner for years. We talk about this a little more in our episode on The Disney Exodus from last year.\n\nSo, what’s one of the most successful animation producers to do when he finds himself out of a job?\n\nWell, luckily for Katzenburg, another producer and director had already rounded up some of the best talent in animation outside of the US. Katzenburg, Spielberg, and businessman David Geffin created Dreamworks SKG, and named Katzenburg as the head of the animation division.\n\nOf course, as Spielberg focused more on the new venture, Amblimation fell to the wayside. Many sources report that all the animators currently employed at the studio moved to Dreamworks Animation by 1995, and Amblimation was defunct by 1997.\n\nAmblimation might not have lasted long, but its legacy will live on in our hearts forever. It didn’t make the most groundbreaking or popular films, sure, but it wasn’t afraid to try new things. Looking at the box office, it’s easy to say they were an undisputed failure. But, that’s okay. Amblimation wasn’t afraid to fail, and success isn’t always measured in dollars. They made three perfectly respectable films that entertained millions of kids, just not in the theater. They learned from their mistakes, and they moved on to make more films at one of the most successful animation studios today. Without Amblimation, we would not only be missing these movies, but we might’ve missed out on films like The Prince of Egypt and How to Train Your Dragon. There’s something to be said for the lesson that Amblimation taught us. Steven Spielberg is one of the most successful and respected filmmakers of all time; and if he’s not afraid to fail, maybe we shouldn’t be, either.\n\nBefore we go, we’d like to thank our Patrons!

Last year, we packed this month with several historical episodes about the beautiful artform of animation. This year, we’re starting the month with something a little different.\n\nThe Lion King, The Prince of Egypt, and Toy Story are all beloved animated classics that have stood the test of time. But today, we won’t be talking about any of them. Every once in a while, a beautiful animated movie will hit theaters, and do…okay. They can have great stories, wonderful performances, and innovative design, but people just won’t go to see it. Sometimes it’s because the studio doesn’t have enough name recognition. Other times it’s because of marketing, or because the movie looks strange and took risks, and people like the familiar. Why do you think Disney still makes princess movies? Because it’s what the people want. Why are all the Marvel movies the same; allow me to answer by directing you to my previous sentence.\n\nSo today, we each picked a movie that we felt deserved a little more exposure. These are films we love, that if you haven’t seen, we recommend you give them a chance. Here are our animated hidden gems!\n\nADAM- SURF’S UP (2007)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nSurfing means everything to teenage penguin Cody Maverick. Followed by a documentary film crew, he leaves his home in Shiverpool, Antarctica for PenGu Island, site of the Big Z Memorial Surf Off. Cody wants to be respected and admired, and he believes that only winning the competition will bring him that. However, an encounter with washed-up surfer Geek, teaches Cody about what is truly important.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nSurf’s Up is a mockumentary comedy film directed by Ash Brannon and Chris Buck. Starting production in 2002, it was Sony Pictures Animation’s second theatrical feature film after Open Season. It is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as The Endless Summer and Riding Giants.\n\nEarly on in production, one of the first things they did was take the entire crew and actors to the beach to take surfing lessons. It was to get a sense of the characters’ lifestyle as well as to take in the majesty of the ocean and waves. They were looking for a balance between the fun and flair of surfing, with the danger and power of the ocean.\n\nThe animators even designed a unique rig just for the waves, so they could be properly realized.\n\nFor this movie, the directors wanted to nail the documentary feel. Most documentaries have someone with a camera trying to capture spontaneous moments and it’s often rough and jittery. To obtain the desired hand-held organic feel, the film’s animation team used, an at the time, groundbreaking motion-capture technology that utilized a physical camera and a live operator’s movements. It was a camera that filmed a digital environment through the viewfinder, with another small camera on top that senses the outside room. This allows the camera operation to move around in the virtual space while the digital images stay in their place.\n\nIn another unusual move, the directors decided to have voice recording sessions done live in person with multiple actors together. Usually voice acting is done in a small booth with one actor being fed lines to say in various ways. But for Surf’s up they didn’t want the dialogue to sound like it was planned out or being read from a page. This was crucial to creating the documentary, “this is happening right in front of us” feel.\n\nAsh Brannon said in a behind the scenes interview talking about creating real chemistry, “We encouraged them to overlap each other and just be themselves. People recognize real conversation. It just has a different sound to it than a scripted movie. Everything about the way you talk changes when you are talking face to face.”\n\nShia LaBeouf also recalled being told that they were willing to do three hours of ad libbing for a five second moment on screen. Many of Cody’s (the main character) lines were in fact adlibs.\n\nReal-life surfers Kelly Slater and Rob Machado make appearances as their penguin surfer counterparts along with Sal Masekela, the announcer for the X-Games. They were originally brought on as consultants for the film, but the directors got the idea to create an in universe sports network to add to the feeling of authenticity, and they were the perfect voices for the job.\n\nVOICES\n\nShia LaBeouf as Cody Maverick\n\nKnown for many movies including Holes, Transformers and Disturbia.\n\nJeff Bridges as Zeke “Big Z/Geek”\n\nAlso a well known actor from films like Tron: Legacy, The Big Lebowski and True Grit.\n\nZooey Deschanel as Lani\n\nShe is in many things such as 500 Days of Summer, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, but may be most currently known for her role in New Girl.\n\nJon Heder as Chicken Joe\n\nMost famous for playing Napoleon Dynamite he is also in Blades of Glory, and provided a voice in Monster House.\n\nMario Cantone as Mikey\n\nHe is an actor that is know mainly for his part in Sex and the City (both the show and movies.)\n\nJames Woods as Reggie Belafonte\n\nA famous voice that we all know from Hercules. But he was also in things like Once Upon a Time in America (1984), and the 2006 version of E.R.\n\nDiedrich Bader as Tank Evans\n\nA voice actor for numerous cartoons and games, he was also in Office Space and Napoleon Dynamite.\n\nKelly Slater as the penguin version of himself\n\nKnown for an unprecedented 11 world surfing championship wins and is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional surfers of all time.\n\nRob Machado as the penguin version of himself\n\nMachado has won the Hawaii’s Pipeline Masters (which is called the Triple Crown of Surfing), and the U.S. Open of Surfing, the largest surfing event held on the U.S. mainland.\n\nHe also hosts and participates in an annual event held at his home reef called the “Rob Machado Surf Classic and Beach Fair” which is an amateur competition for the locals of all ages.\n\nSelema “Sal” Mabena Masekela as himself (sports tv announcer)\n\nHe is an American television host, sports commentator, actor and singer. He was also the voice of the X-games for 13 years, including the time this movie came out.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSurf’s Up: Original Ocean Picture Score was composed for the film by Mychael Danna.\n\nHe also did the recent Onward with his brother Jeff Danna as well as the new Addams Family and The Good Dinosaur.\n\nThe soundtrack for this film is made up of many popular rock, punk rock, and alternative rock bands from all around North America and The UK.\n\nEx: Green Day, Pearl Jam, Incubus, Sugar Ray.\n\nAccording to the film’s end credits, the version of “Wipe Out” heard in the film is actually performed by The Queers. The official soundtrack includes this version under the pseudonym “Big Nose”, for marketing purposes. It is to this day, the only song under that name.\n\nRECEPTION\n\nThe film was released on June 8, 2007, and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation and humor. However, the film didn’t break any sales records, grossing $149 million against a budget of $100 million.\n\nBut it was also nominated at the 80th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature! Ratatouille was the winner that year.\n\nA straight to dvd sequel was made in 2017 called “Surf’s Up 2: WaveMania” as a cameo tie in with the WWE.\n\nJon Heder and Diedrich Bader were the only two to reprise their roles.\n\nWe don’t talk about this one…\n\nWHY THIS MOVIE IS A HIDDEN GEM\n\nWith so many CGI animated feature films starring cute animals pouring in year after year, it can be tough to sort through them all and figure out which ones are worth looking at. Surf’s Up belongs in the pile with the good ones. This mockumentary film has a unique humor to it that spins the same old underdog storyline into something fresh that everyone can enjoy. It is one of Surf’s Up’s most admirable traits. There’s enough for the adults without too much material going over kids’ heads and there’s plenty of physical humor that kids will enjoy. The mockumentary style provides a fresh perspective, and there’s also plenty of good values that one would expect from an animated movie focused on a sport: never give up, winning isn’t everything, and the value of friendship.\n\nAdditionally, the animation is strong. Most interesting is the way the animation is meant to reflect real life as if it were being shot like a live-action documentary. So, it’s very cool in terms of filmmaking, not just a mere concept. It’s unique, sweet and fun to watch. This movie keeps the plot simple but shows it in a new and very interesting way.\n\nROBIN- THE LAST UNICORN (1982)\n\nSometimes a hidden gem can garner a cult following, but still somehow avoid the radar of mainstream audiences. The film I chose is certainly popular in some circles, and is still regarded as one of the best and lasting animated films of the 1980’s. But, I personally know a lot of people who haven’t seen it, and some who are unwilling to give it a chance. So, I am bringing it up today in the hopes that at least one person listening has not seen it, and will seek it out with an open mind. https://www.youtube.com/embed/Enq2pFpBz1s?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\n\nWe all know Rankin and Bass as the team that brought Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman to life. But in the fall of 1982, they produced a full-length feature film that was worlds away from their happy holiday specials. It was based on a popular novel by Peter S. Beagle, and starred Mia Farrow as the titular character: a unicorn who has just discovered that she may be the last of her kind.\n\nThe Last Unicorn is a heartfelt and imaginative story. It is weird, dark, and wonderful. It entertained and horrified an entire generation of children, and aged well with them as it contains messages that only adults will likely understand.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nFrom a riddle-speaking butterfly, a unicorn learns that she is the last of her kind, all of the others having been herded away by a terrifying force known as the Red Bull. The unicorn sets out to find others like her. She is eventually joined on her quest by Schmendrick, a hapless magician, and Molly Grue, a middle-aged woman. Their journey leads them to the castle of the tragic King Haggard, a man who has never known happiness. In order to shield the unicorn from the red bull, Schmendrick transforms her into a human. The three of them stay at Haggard’s castle as they try to find where the rest of the unicorns have gone, and how to save them. They don’t have much time, because the unicorn becomes more and more human each day, as she falls in love with the King’s son. If she forgets her true form, all hope of saving the unicorns may be gone forever.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nPeter S. Beagle is one of the world’s most celebrated fantasy authors. In 1968, he published The Last Unicorn, a book listed in Time Magazine’s “100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time in October of 2020. The list was curated by a panel of authors, including Neil Gaiman and George RR Martin.\n\nBeagle himself never really imagined the story becoming a film, but it was so popular that filmmakers started approaching early on. Beagle knew he would be devastated if another writer touched and changed his work, so he insisted on writing the screenplay if this were to ever happen. Now, we all know that just because someone is a good writer, it doesn’t mean they are a good screenwriter. But, because Beagle had written the screenplay for the 1978 animated “Lord of the Rings,” the studio allowed him to write The Last Unicorn as well.\n\nBeagle has said that he didn’t have any input other than his screenplay, but that the film stayed remarkably close to what he had written.\n\nAccording to Beagle, Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez (the creators of the Charlie Brown specials) were interested in making the film. But, one of the partners’ wives pulled Beagle aside and reportedly said, “Don’t let us do it, we aren’t good enough.” Beagle didn’t know what possessed her to do that, but Mendelson and Melendez ended up not taking on the job.\n\nProducer Michael Chase Walker bought the rights to the book from Beagle, and optioned it to different animation studios. Finally, Rankin/Bass’s offer was the one they went with, which concerned Beagle.\n\nLike I said before, these were the Rudolph guys. You can forgive Beagle for being a little apprehensive as they tackled this epic fantasy film.\n\n“I do remember being horrified when he told me that Rankin & Bass had made the deal with him, and screaming ‘Why the hell didn’t you just go to Hanna-Barbera!’ To which he replied ‘They were next on the list.’ That was going to be it.”\n\nAs we mentioned in our Rank(ing) and Bass episode, the studio always outsourced their animation to Japan, with great success. The Last Unicorn was no different, as Rankin and Bass acted as directors, and employed the Japanese studio Topcraft to bring the movie to life under the production management of Masaki Izuka. A few years later, Topcraft folded and was bought by legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki, along with Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki. They built the studio into the magnificent powerhouse that is Studio Ghibli.\n\nSTARRING\n\nWhen Rankin and Bass set out to cast the film, the animators were able to secure every voice actor they wanted. No one turned down a part, which meant the film had a stellar cast.\n\nLegendary screen and stage actress Mia Farrow plays The Unicorn/Lady Amalthea.\n\nShe’s known for many things, including Rosemary’s Baby, A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy, and Alice.\n\nJeff Bridges plays Prince Lir\n\nAfter hearing that a friend of his was cast in the film, Bridges called Jules Bass and asked for a role, offering to work for free. Bass hired him immediately to play Prince Lir.\n\nAlan Arkin plays Shmendrick the magician\n\nPeter Beagle has praised the performances of the actors in the film, all except for Arkin. He thought his version of Schmendrick was a little flat. Arkin brought an every-man quality to the character, though, as he wasn’t meant to really steal the show.\n\nTammy Grimes plays Molly Gru\n\nWhile Beagle was critical of Arkin, he seemed impressed with Tammy Grimes’ version of Molly Gru. He said in an interview that Grimes brought something to the character that he himself didn’t add.\n\nChristopher Lee plays King Haggard\n\nLee was a huge fan of the book, and brought his own annotated copy to his recording sessions. When he saw Beagle, he asked for his approval of his vocal performance and offered to do it again if it was unsatisfactory.\n\nLee was also fluent in German, and loved playing King Haggard so much, he recorded the lines for German version of the film as well.\n\nAngela Lansbury plays Mommy Fortuna\n\nRobert Klein plays the butterfly\n\nRene Auberjonois plays the talking skull.\n\nAnd Rankin/Bass regulars Paul Frees and Keenan Wynn played various voices as well\n\nMUSIC\n\nSongwriter and composer Jimmy Webb created the music for The Last Unicorn. He’s had many popular songs for artists like Donna Summer, Art Garfunkel, and Glen Campbell.\n\nThe songs for the movie were performed by the actors, and the folk rock band, America.\n\nThe modern sound of the music, mixed with the medieval imagery adds a timeless element to the film. It’s never specified when the story takes place, and there are modern references throughout.\n\nRECEPTION\n\nDespite the film’s cult following, producers had a difficult time finding a distribution company. Eventually, the now-defunct Jensen Farley Pictures released the film on less than 700 screens across the country. It was rated G, despite scary imagery that would plague children’s nightmares for years to come. According to IMDB, the film’s budget was $3,500,000, and made $6,455,330. But, these numbers are misleading. Fans of the film and internet sleuths have claimed that reporting on the box office numbers stopped after 17 days. If this is true, it would mean that the actual amount earned will likely never be known. They believed that this was because Jensen Farley reported bankruptcy while distributing the film, but according to court documents, this happened later.\n\nAlthough the film made money, it wasn’t considered a huge success. Some sources claim that the producers didn’t see profits from the film. Peter S. Beagle has said that he thought the film was better than expected, and loves the animation.\n\nThe film received favorable reviews. Janet Maslin of the NYT said, ”’THE Last Unicorn’ is an unusual children’s film in many respects, the chief one being that it is unusually good. This animated fable also features a cast that would do any live-action film proud, a visual style noticeably different from that of other children’s fare, and a story filled with genuine sweetness and mystery. Children, except perhaps for very small ones, ought to be intrigued by it; adults won’t be bored. And no one of any age will be immune to the sentiment of the film’s final moments, which really are unexpectedly touching and memorable.”\n\nWHY IS THIS A HIDDEN GEM?\n\nThe Last Unicorn is a wonderful movie that showcases the best that 1980’s animation had to offer. It’s not Disney or Don Bluth, and it had an uphill battle all through its creation. It’s a movie that most of us have heard about, but maybe only saw once as a kid or never at all. At times, the story seems like a standard hero’s quest for children, and then it throws the audience a curveball. One moment, you think you’re watching a cute film about a unicorn, the next, you’re watching the comic relief almost get smothered by the breasts of a lovestruck tree.\n\nThe film has sharp edges, and presents truths that will have the adult audience nodding its head in agreement. We watch as an immortal, magnificent creature must seek help from humble, fragile humans. And in time, she’s burdened by the lessons of humanity like love and regret.\n\nMARCI- THE WIZARD OF OZ (1982)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nDorothy is left to tend to the farm alone as her Auntie Em and Uncle Henry go off to run some errands. When a tornado comes she frantically tries to get herself and her dog, Toto, into the cellar. When Toto runs from her because he gets scared Dorothy gets knocked out as she is thrown to the floor of the cabin. When she wakes up it is in The Land of Oz where she meets many characters and tries to find her way home to Kansas. (You know the basic plot of The Wizard of Oz.. lol)\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nThis little gem was based on L. Frank Baum’s Wizard of Oz and directed by Fumihiko Takayama. The screenplay was written by Yoshimitsu Banno and Akira Miyazaki.\n\nIt was produced by Banno and Katsumi Ueno for Toho Co., Ltd. This movie was also made with cooperation from Topcraft Animation!\n\nEnglish version came first\n\nAlthough this movie was animated in Japan it was not dubbed for Japanese release until 1986! The English version surprisingly came first.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe music was done by Joe Hisaishi and Yuichiro Oda. Joe would later go on to write music for many of the Studio Ghibli movies like Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Castle in the Sky. There were three songs and the English lyrics were written by Sammy Cahn and Allen Byrns. The three songs were all performed in English by Aileen Quinn and are; “It’s Strictly Up to You,” “I Dream of Home,” and “A Wizard of a Day.”\n\nTHE BOOK, THE 1939 MOVIE AND THIS MOVIE\n\nEveryone of course knows Dorothy as this lovely young girl portrayed by the brown haired and pigtailed Judy Garland in the 1939 live action. It is hard for most to see her any other way. L. Frank Baum himself did not give her specific physical descriptors in the first book; instead saying things like how she was an orphan, innocent, and harmless little girl. In this animated version, however, she had blonde hair tied up into a single ponytail with a simple red ribbon.\n\nOverall this movie is much more similar to the original book than the 1939 version but the one key difference that it kept was the red slippers.\n\nOne of the closer similarities to the book was that the first witch that Dorothy stumbles upon is the Good Witch of the North and she is not Glinda. Glinda, just like the book, is the Good Witch of the South.\n\nThe second similarity would be that each of the characters is shown a different version of the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz.\n\nDorothy is shown a gigantic green head.\n\nThe Scare-crow is shown a beautiful angel.\n\nTin-Man sees him as a scary rhino. (In the book it was said to be a great beast, not necessarily a rhino.)\n\nFinally the Lion sees the wizard as a great big ball of fire.\n\nThe final similarity to mention is the appearance of the Kalidahs. Kalidahs are vicious large creatures that appear within Oz.\n\nVOICES\n\nAmerican\n\nAileen Quinn as Dorothy\n\nShe was also Annie in the 1982 Annie.\n\nLorne Greene – The Wizard\n\nHe is known for Bonanza, Battlestar Galactica, and the movie Earthquake.\n\nBilly Van – Scarecrow\n\nHe was in things like The Hilarious House of Frightenstein and Law and Order.\n\nJohn Stocker – Tin Man\n\nHe has done for things like The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and a couple of the Care Bear movies.\n\nThick Wilson – Cowardly Lion\n\nHe has done voices for the animated Alf series and he was also in Tommy Boy and The Dark Crystal.\n\nElizabeth Hanna – The Good Witch of the North, Jellia Jamb, The Wicked Witch of the West\n\nShe has done voices for many different things including Babaar, Little Bear, and Care Bears.\n\nWendy Thatcher – Glinda, the Good Witch of the South\n\nShe is known for Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend, Threshold, and High-Ballin’.\n\nJapanese Voices\n\nMari Okamoto – Dorothy Gale\n\nKotobuki Hizuru – Scarecrow\n\nJōji Yanami – Tin Man\n\nMasashi Amenomori – Cowardly Lion\n\nNaoki Tatsuta – Uncle Henry\n\nTaeko Nakanishi – Aunt Em and Jellia Jamb\n\nMiyoko Asō – The Good Witch of the North\n\nKaori Kishi – The Wicked Witch of the West\n\nKazuo Kumakura – The Wizard\n\nKumiko Takizawa – Glinda, the Good Witch of the South\n\nShohei Matsubara – Toto\n\nMotomu Kiyokawa – Soldier\n\nToshiyuki Yamamoto – Monkey King\n\nWHY THIS MOVIE IS A HIDDEN GEM\n\nThis movie is not well known, and to be honest there was not a lot of information floating around about it either. It’s beautiful that this movie is able to follow the story of the book just a bit closer and show us some lovely animation. I think what is most charming about it is that they are able to show that each of the characters Dorothy meets essentially already have what they are asking the wizard for. The Tin Man becomes sad over killing a bug which shows he cares and has heart. The Lion distracts the vicious Kalidah, showing he has courage. Finally, the Scarecrow makes plans and has good ideas like cutting a tree to create a bridge which demonstrates that he can think.\n\nThis is a charming version of The Wizard of Oz and a hidden gem you just might want to check out.\n\nThe best thing about animation is that there is so much of it. Some of it might be a little rough, but some of it is spectacular. For every movie like “The Lion King,” there’s a beautiful hidden gem that deserves a little love. So don’t be afraid to go see the animated movies that you haven’t heard as much about. Worst case scenario, it will be an adventure. The best case scenario, you will find a movie that you might end up loving for years to come.\n\nSo go give these films a watch if you haven’t already, and tell us what you think! Do you have any hidden gems that you would like us to watch or talk about? Let us know!\n\nBefore we go, we’d like to thank our Patrons! Joel, John, Jacob, Jacklyn, JD, Anthony, Shelli, and Linda.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1982_film)\n\nhttps://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15346\n\nhttps://www.mangauk.com/oz-anime-style/\n\nhttps://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/56754-Ozu-No-Mah%F4tsukai\n\nhttp://www.webwizardofoz.com/film_10.html\n\nhttps://www.wikizero.com/en/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1982_film)\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWizardOfOz\n\nhttps://www.animenewsnetwork.com/old-school/2003-06-17\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\n\n_l626ZKxEyw\n\nSurf’s Up DVD\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084237/\n\nhttps://film.avclub.com/the-last-unicorn-was-nightmare-fuel-to-a-generation-of-1798276272\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2020/05/geeks-guide-last-unicorn/\n\nhttps://www.cbr.com/rudolph-studio-made-last-unicorn-adaptation/\n\nThe Case of Light\n\nHey Cassettes and welcome back to another episode of the BCD!\n\nThis week, we’re doing something a little different. Marci and Robin are stepping out of their comfort zone, and allowing Adam to teach them about something completely new (to them)!\n\nIn the time before time, the Great Spirit descended from the heavens carrying Alastair Swinnerton, Bob Thompson, Martin Andersen, and Christian Faber. Together they illuminated us with the three virtues; Unity, Duty and Destiny, and in 2001, Bionicle hit store shelves. It was a smash hit, connecting with kids around the world and taking LEGO out of the red by 2004. A place the company hasn’t returned to since, despite more recent struggles.\n\nSet in a universe filled with biomechanical beings, the world of Bionicle was unique, intriguing, and mysterious. Harnessing the power of the elements on their island home, the six Toa heroes are destined to save the world from the evil Makuta. LEGO dove deep into this world which spawned hundreds of toys that sold by the millions. Coupled with dozens of characters and a complex lore that would take a whole year of college classes to fully understand. But it worked. It was such a success that talks of a feature length movie started in the same year.\n\nSo, gathered friends, listen again to our legend, of Bionicle: Mask of Light.\n\nHISTORY OF BIONICLE\n\nIN NEED OF AN IDEA\n\nBefore the LEGO company became the largest toy company in the world, they were on a downward spiral that was nearly their end. The 90’s saw absolutely horrid sales and in 1997 the company posted a loss for the first time since their beginning in 1932. Not even securing the Star Wars brand was enough to save them from the brink.\n\nStar Wars at the time was a franchise based solely on the movies. The interest in Star Wars toys would dip drastically if there wasn’t a new movie that year. LEGO knew that this was not sustainable.\n\nLEGO needed something original that they could produce and sell year-round. Something to appeal to a new generation of builders. They realized that kids in this quickly growing modern world wanted something to play with that would encompass more than simple building blocks. Kids wanted a story behind those blocks, and to go with it, new pieces they could use to create their own characters and fantasies.\n\nLEGO hired various staff from the broadcasting world to come up with story-based ideas, to counter the all-conquering franchise Pokemon. At the time, Pokemon was largely credited with Lego suffering their first loss. Many ideas were brainstormed and pitched to Erik Kramer, then Technical Director at LEGO, including one called ‘Bone Heads of Voodoo Island’, or Voodoo Heads for short. Secrecy was so tight around Bionicle that this original title was known only to the insiders for many years.\n\nCREATORS\n\nThe key Lego creators of ‘Voodoo Heads’ were Bob Thompson, who had become Head of Story, and Martin Andersen, then a ‘mere’ toy designer. The third of the four ‘official’ co-creators was Christian Faber, Creative Director of the Danish advertising agency Advance, who created the amazing graphic look of the whole project.\n\nIt was not until Alastair Swinnerton got a hold of the project shortly after, that Bionicle began to take its final form.\n\nAccording to an recount written by Swinnerton on his personal website, “Voodoo Heads,” along with other brief concepts were sent to outside writers at a company called Skryptonite.\n\nHe said, “Something about ‘Voodoo Heads’ caught my eye, so I decided to work on that one. It had a kind of Easter Island vibe to it I felt, and I’d always been fascinated with that subject. The basic story was there – a bunch of characters on an island, not knowing why. But that was about it. So I pretty much started again with the concept.”\n\nThe rewrite of the concept was sent back to Bob Thompson, and he liked it. He liked it so much, in fact, that come February 2000, Swinnerton was on a plane to Lego HQ in Denmark.\n\nMOVIE SUMMARY\n\nThe movie picks up in the second story arc after the Toa have already been around for a while. So in order to get the best comprehension out of the story, you should at least know this: It takes place on the mysterious island of Mata Nui. The spirit protecting the island, also called Mata Nui, has been put into a deep sleep. Six Toa heroes fall from the sky and discover that it is their duty to find the masks of power, defeat Makuta and reawaken the great spirit.\n\nEverything seems fine and dandy on the island and the matoran are safe and happy. They are in the midst of peace and prosperity! The different tribes are getting along and they even built a new stadium to play the sport of Kohlii. It is not until one curious matoran, Takua, makes a very important discovery: that Makuta again rears his ugly head.\n\nThe mask of light has been found! The Turaga tell that it is a sign of the coming of a seventh Toa! Now the reluctant hero Takua and his friend Jalla, are sent on a quest across the island in search of their destiny.\n\nMeanwhile, Makuta must not let this happen. So he sends his evil sons, the Rahkshi, to find Takua and take the mask of light.\n\nMaking of the movie\n\nFrom the beginning the creators envisioned that there would be a Bionicle movie. Thanks to the toy’s unprecedented success, Miramax and Lego made a partnership in 2002 to develop and distribute three direct to DVD movies with budgets estimated at around $5 million each.\n\nWhile most projects of its type took 18 to 24 months to complete, the development team completed the film in 13 months. This was due to a convenient arrangement with the Taiwanese animation studio CGCG that created most of the animation. As the US based team was done with work, the team in Taiwan was just getting started. So work was being done on the film almost 24/7.\n\nCGCG Inc. has also done animation work for Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and even the more recent Jurassic World: Camp Cretaious! (This fact has made Adam very happy haha!)\n\nThe film was co-directed by Terry Shakespeare and David Molina.\n\nShakespeare and Molina both started as animators working with Don Bluth and would later go on to work at Disney. (Reverse exodus?) They worked on films such as An American Tail, Secret of NIMH, Beauty and the Beast, and more.\n\nThey both began their paths to directing as animation directors for video games. Their first project was a game called Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (1994.) They both did many video games for years until they were both given a shot at a film in 2002, with Bionicle: Mask of Light! They would both also go on to direct the two soon-after sequels.\n\nYou could say that Mask of Light had many writers, because the story came from many places and went through many hands. We mentioned the big influence Alastair Swinnerton had on the Bionicle story, and he had a part in writing for this movie as well. But the biggest credit for the film itself goes to Henry Gilroy for the screenplay.\n\nGilroy has many TV writing credits we’re sure you’ve heard of. For example, the 90’s Batman animated series, the Timon & Pumbaa tv series, Star War: The Clone Wars, and Avengers Assemble.\n\nUnlike previous Lego themes, Bionicle was accompanied by an original story told across a wide array of media. From comics, games, and commercials, to books, and web animations. This meant that many fans had their favorite version of the story so far, and it was important to keep that in mind.\n\nAccording to the behind the scenes extras of the DVD, one of the biggest considerations was being honest with the loyal fan base and being true to the source material. Bob Thompson said in an interview, “People often talk about, when they make a film from a book, everyone that has read the book has a slightly different take on it. Well this is even more extreme because everyone that’s played with the toy has a belief about what Bionicle is.”\n\nWhen choosing a style, directors Shakespeare and Molina noted that there were several already existing interpretations of the Bionicle look. They would go through it all during the early design phase, including flash webcomics, comic books, and CGI commercials; they eventually decided upon the more commercial look. (Perhaps we could have gotten a great 2D animated movie in another life!)\n\nThe characters were changed as little as possible, while still adding enough new detail in order for the characters to act and move as we would expect. Including the addition of hands and masks that can move as they talk.\n\nThe look is loved by many fans and disliked by others and is now referred to as the Miramax style. The same look would continue for the next two movies.\n\nWhile writing, Henry Gilroy made sure to stick with what had come before. This was the first Bionicle movie, but it was picking up on what was then, the second major story arc. So he had to be mindful of how characters think and behave.\n\nThe team developed new expressions that would fit in the world. For example, Takua says, “hold your rahi” instead of the “hold your horses” and Jalla says “You could have been lava bones” in place of “You could have been killed.”\n\nThere were many discussions about this with the casting director Kris Zimmerman. Henry said also on the DVD, “I think everybody has a certain expectation for the voice they want to hear coming out of their favorite Toa. Every Bionicle fan has their favorite Toa, so we really wanted to be true to them, to somehow instil in them a voice that would be believable to the hardcore fans. So they didn’t sound like they lived in the United States or in Europe, but that they came from their own world.”\n\nSTARRING\n\nJason Michas as our main character Takua.\n\nHe has had other voice roles such as Ernest Goes to School, and the show Dragon Tales.\n\nAndrew Francis as Jalla, the Captain of Ta-Koro’s Guard\n\nHe has made his way more recently in tv shows and doing english dubs for anime, such as the localization of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.\n\nAccording to Kris Zimmerman, the two leads came in to audition for the opposite roles they would eventually get. Andrew came in very well dressed and professional, while Jason dressed in a hawian shirt and cracked jokes the whole time. Kris eventually had them try and switch their lines, and the characters just clicked.\n\nScott McNeil would voice both Tahu, Toa of Fire and Onua, Toa of Earth\n\nHe is know for doing many english dubs for anime such as the extremely popular Dragon Ball Z and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.\n\nDale Wilson as Lewa, Toa of Air\n\nHe has made an appearance in Psych and has provided voices for things like, Transformers, Stargate, and X-Man: Evolution.\n\nKathleen Barr as Gali, Toa of Water\n\nShe has over 300 voice credits on IMDB including My Little Pony, Ninjago (another LEGO property), Ed Edd n Eddy, and Veggietales.\n\nMichael Dobson as Kopaka, the Toa of Ice\n\nHe has done many voices as well, including The Hulk, Sausage Party, and Norm of the North.\n\nTrevor Devall as Pohatu, Toa of Stone\n\nHe has many cartoon and gaming voice roles such as Halo 5, Regular Show and the new ThunderCats Roar.\n\nLee Tockar as the Makuta, the main antagonist.\n\nHe is also in many cartoon roles such as in Bob the Builder, Johnny Test, and even the Ratchet and Clank movie!\n\nRECEPTION/AWARDS\n\nObviously this movie is a freaking masterpiece of the highest quality! Just kidding! Or am !?\n\nAmong fans of Bionicle, it is a well loved movie and the majority favorite of all four films. With an existing knowledge of characters and the world, the film really shines for what it is.\n\nThe main criticism from many is that it relies heavily on knowledge of earlier Bionicle storylines. It could be said that it was almost “too respectful” in this aspect.\n\nEntertainment Weekly gave the film a “B+”, calling it a “well-constructed CGI adventure” and saying that even those who did not understand the story would at least enjoy the effects and action sequences.\n\nAnd Don Houston of DVDTalk, also was generally positive about the film. He called the direction and visuals “exceptionally crisp and clear” when compared to other films of its type, and gave high praise to the voice acting and noting darker themes within the film.\n\nThe movie has actually won two awards!\n\nIn 2003, Mask of Light won a Golden Reel Award for Best Visual Effects in a DVD Premiere Movie, also it won the Best DVD release award at the 2004 Saturn Awards.\n\nBionicle: Mask of Light’s success prompted later Lego themes to utilize similar story-telling methods. Ninjago, Hero Factory, and Legends of Chima to name a few. But Bionicle was special. It was a deep and fascinating franchise loved by many. Bringing in the fans of fantasy, and sci-fi, as well as Lego builders all together. From the beginning, it had an element of mystery—what are these robots doing on an island? Wait, are they even robots? Where did the Toa come from? How powerful is Makuta? But somehow you knew that there was even more beneath the surface. Movies like Mask of Light brought a new light, pun intended, to that mystery.\n\nAfter a long ten year run, the story is kept alive today by the undying love of its fans. More and more new builds, games, art, and stories are shared everyday. And there is even more still creeping just past the horizon. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Bionicle! So, happy anniversary! We look forward to the next time, when we will all listen again to the legend of the Bionicle.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://alastairswinnerton.com/2015/09/07/bionicle-my-actual-part-in-its-origins/\n\nhttps://bionicle.fandom.com/wiki/BIONICLE:_Mask_of_Light_(movie)\n\nhttps://www.awn.com/vfxworld/bionicle-universe-expands-home-entertainment\n\nBionicle.com via the Wayback Machine at archive.org\n\nThe Case of Rankin(g) and Bass\n\nWell, Christmas is a-coming and bells begin to ring! Wreaths are on front doors, stores are crowded (though they really shouldn’t be) and Christmas music is assaulting our eardrums once more (just kidding…but am I?) But most of all, it’s that time again to watch the Rankin and Bass Christmas specials!\n\nBack in the 1960’s, the concept of a holiday TV special was brand new. It started with Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol in 1962. The idea was well-received, with advertisers jumping at the opportunity to profit on the undivided attention of families gathered for the holidays. In 1964, an animation studio known as Videocraft International created a Christmas special about a reindeer with a bright red nose. Although previous holiday specials were generally successful, this quirky stop-motion classic changed the game.\n\nThe success of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer was undeniable. The off-beat animation perfectly matched the eccentric, yet lovable characters. So, the animators went to work and produced more holiday specials for years to come. Soon Rankin and Bass, as the company was later known, was a fixture of the holiday season. Their work has become a holiday tradition, and some wouldn’t consider it Christmas without it.\n\nThere are so many specials, we couldn’t possibly talk about all of them. So, we have picked our top 5 favorites! It’s time, cassettes, for Rankin(g) and Bass!\n\nHISTORY OF RANKIN/BASS\n\nBefore we get into our favorite specials, let’s talk about the history of Rankin and Bass!\n\nIn the early 1950’s, Arthur Rankin was an art director for ABC. Eventually he left the network to start his own business, making commercials for ad agencies. Through this experience, he met Jules Bass, when he would deliver materials from Gardner Advertising to Rankin’s studio.\n\nThe two decided to go into business together, combining Rankin’s experience in Art Direction and Bass’s advertising knowledge. Although it was a no-brainer for the two to create TV commercials, Rankin has always wanted to animate. So, the two men decided to create an animation studio called VideoCraft International (and later, Rankin/Bass.)\n\nIn the late 1950’s, a Japanese Delegation came to New York, and spoke with people in the entertainment business. One of them was Rankin, who decided to travel to the country in 1958. While he was there, he toured various studios, and fell in love with the animation techniques they employed, which he later called “animagic.” He was also impressed by the speed and quantity of animation that came through the studios; and ultimately, Rankin recognized the immense talent of these animators. Therefore, Rankin and Bass outsourced all the animation for their first series to studios in Japan.\n\nRankin and Bass chose Pinocchio first because he was a well-known character, and they wanted to draw in audiences. Their next series was cell animation, based on characters from The Wizard of Oz (since it had lapsed into the public domain.)\n\nOne company that was impressed by their work, was General Electric. They commissioned some TV commercial work from Rankin and Bass.\n\nDue to the success of the advertisements, the men started planning something bigger for GE: an animated Christmas special!\n\nOf course, this special would become the holiday staple known as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer–and as they say, the rest is history.\n\nFor the next 30 years, Rankin and Bass produced stop-motion and cell-animated holiday specials, TV shows, and live-action films. Their careers were so vast, they can be found all throughout American pop-culture, even in places you might not expect. From the 1980’s series Thundercats, to shows about The Osmonds and the Jackson 5, to specials about Easter, Thanksgiving, and Smokey the Bear–Rankin and Bass did so much more than Christmas specials. They were a full-fledged animation studio that influenced and entertained millions.\n\nBut of course, it is Christmastime, so today we are talking about their contribution to the holiday. Let’s start Rankin’ our favorite Rankin and Bass Christmas specials!\n\nNUMBER 5\n\nTHE FIRST CHRISTMAS: THE STORY OF THE FIRST CHRISTMAS SNOW\n\nThe First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow was the 8th Christmas special by Rankin and Bass, and first aired December 19th, 1975 on NBC.\n\nVideo Link\n\nPlot\n\nAfter a young shepherd is left blind from a lightning strike, the nuns of a nearby abbey take him and his animals in. The priest insists that the nuns send the boy, named Lukas, to an orphanage after Christmas. Sister Theresa, the head nun, tells Lukas about the white Christmases she saw growing up. Lukas is fascinated by the idea of snow, since he has never seen it. His one wish for Christmas is for it to snow, and he asks a friend to describe it to him if it comes.\n\nWhile the abbey performs their nativity play, snow miraculously begins to fall (since they never have snow in their climate.) Lukas suddenly can see again, as the snow has seemed to cure his blindness. The priest and nuns decide to let Lukas stay with them at the abbey.\n\nMaking of\n\nThe special was written by Julian P Gardner, which was a pseudonym for Jules Bass!\n\nThe music was done by Maury Laws with lyrics by Jules Bass, just like previous Rankin and Bass specials, but with a special appearance of “White Christmas” by Irving Berlin.\n\nThis special was made with “animagic,” the term coined by Arthur Rankin to describe the stop-motion process used by the studios in Japan.\n\nIchiro Komuro and Akakazu Kono were the production supervisors for the animagic process, which of course included characters made of foam and latex, with ball-in-socket joints. Animagic also used projected imagery on its miniature sets and characters to add a kind of visual magic to some scenes–like the scene where it snows.\n\nStarring\n\nAngela Lansbury stars as Sister Theresa, and also narrates the special. This was of course before she was known as the gentle Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast, but after starring as Miss Price in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\n\nLansbury is a big name actress, but Rankin and Bass had already been known for introducing young audiences to legendary actors like Fred Astaire, and Mickey Rooney.\n\nCyril Ritchard plays Father Thomas, the priest that wants Lukas placed in an orphanage. Ritchard was a seasoned stage actor, well known for his version of Captain Hook in Mary Martin’s Peter Pan! (You know, the version of Peter Pan that every school library had on VHS in the 90s?)\n\nRitchard appeared in other Rankin and Bass productions, including the animated Hobbit.\n\nDavid Kelley only gave his voice to a couple other TV shorts in his career, but he is most well-known for the role of Lukas the shepherd boy.\n\nDina Lynn as Louisa\n\nIris Rainer as Sister Catherine\n\nJoan Gardner as Sister Jean\n\nSean Manning, Don Messick, Greg Thomas, and Hilary Momberger provided additional voices.\n\nImpact/Why we chose it\n\nAfter watching a lot of Rankin and Bass (and we do mean A LOT,) we decided to include this sweet little special as our number 5 choice. When we think of Rankin and Bass, we imagine classic characters like Santa Claus and Frosty, a brightly-colored and non-religious representation of Christmas. But, Rankin and Bass also created specials based on Christian stories, with passages from the bible and the birth of Christ.\n\nBack in the 1960’s, it was frowned upon to use religious messaging in specials, and A Charlie Brown Christmas really paved the way for more religious subject matter in TV entertainment. This is likely why Rankin and Bass’ first special was secular.\n\nThe most notable of these is possibly The Little Drummer Boy, which takes place in Bethlehem and features biblical characters. But if you’re looking for a special with religious themes that doesn’t also include murder and brief animal violence, The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow is a great choice.\n\nThis special is short, and features the comforting voice of Angela Lansbury. For any kids that were raised in Christian households, it features familiar components like the annual nativity play, where the main character plays an angel (a rite of passage for every christian child.)\n\nBut, more than anything, this special isn’t as heavy-handed as other religious material. The story of Christ isn’t the focus, and there is no hard-learned lesson about believing in God. Instead, the focus is on the simple joy of snow on Christmas.\n\nNUMBER 4\n\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN’ TO TOWN\n\nSanta Claus is Comin’ to Town first aired on December 14th, 1970 on ABC.\n\nIf you’ll notice, these specials appeared on all different networks, and this was because Rankin and Bass created them specifically for brands and companies, while the network then aired it as an ad for that brand. That’s right, your favorite Christmas specials are just very intricate commercials!\n\nBack in the 60’s and 70’s, there were fewer commercials on TV, so the special is often edited for modern TV viewing, to keep the full runtime under an hour. Sometimes songs are removed, or more troubling scenes will be omitted.\n\nPlot\n\nSanta Claus is coming to Town follows the origin story of Kris Kingle, a toymaker who eventually becomes Santa Claus. It starts with a train conductor, reading children’s questions about Santa, which then leads into the story. The special explains where Santa comes from, why he brings toys to children, how he met Mrs. Claus, and why he lives at the North Pole.\n\nThis framing device is similar to the one Rankin and Bass used for Rudolph, with an outside character addressing the audience and narrating the story. It was a popular style for many live-action specials, giving these programs a feeling of legitimacy–they were like any other Christmas specials, but animated.\n\nMaking of\n\nSanta Claus is Comin’ to Town is their fifth Christmas special made, and unlike the first special on our list, it was one hour long\n\nWritten by Romeo Muller, the movie was based around the Christmas song with the same name, with music and lyrics by Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie, and originally sung by the American comedian and singer Eddie Cantor in 1934.\n\nWhile the film featured the famous song, it was in amongst original songs by Maury Laws who did the music and lyrics by Jules Bass.\n\nThis team created most of the Rankin and Bass musical catalog, but they counted this soundtrack among their absolute favorites!\n\nMaury Laws later said that this was a very enjoyable project for him because the animation and music gelled so nicely. He said that Mickey Rooney, who played Santa, had the perfect voice to animate to.\n\nThe script was also slightly influenced by the book by L. Frank Baum entitled The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus. While they would later adapt this book into a more faithful adaptation in 1985, some details were used for this film.\n\nThe story is set in Germany, with the name Kris Kringle coming from German folklore. Many people have noted that most of the characters with German accents are villainous, except for Santa’s mother. Because of this, some have made the connection that the German mayor burning the toys of children is a metaphor for the Nazis burning literature and art during WWII.\n\nStarring\n\nFred Astaire as the Postman Narrator, SD Kluger\n\nAstaire added some star power to the special, as someone who often hosted his own holiday and TV specials.\n\nKluger was a character of Fred Astair himself, bearing a remarkable resemblance to the performer.\n\nThe character was so popular, Rankin and Bass brought him back for another special: “The Easter Bunny is Comin to Town.”\n\nMickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/ Santa Claus\n\nRooney had a long and legendary career in show business before playing Kris Kringle at age 50, and continued working long after until his death.\n\nHe reprised his role as Santa Claus in a later Rankin and Bass special that we will talk about here shortly!\n\nKeenan Wynn plays the Winter Warlock\n\nKeenan Wynn was the son of famous character actor Ed Wynn, and he had a career of his own as a character actor.\n\nHe played live-action Disney villains in “The Absent-Minded Professor,” “Son of Flubber,” and “Herbie Rides Again.”\n\nHis full name was Francis Xavier Aloysius James Jeremiah Keenan Wynn.\n\nPaul Frees makes several appearances as Burgermeister Meisterburger, Grimsley, Soldiers, Townsmen, and the Doctor.\n\nFrees was a legendary comedian and voice actor, who would often provide voices for the Rankin and Bass specials, even after his retirement.\n\nThe Burgermeister was one of his most well-known roles, and Frees personally loved voicing him. In case anyone was wondering, a Burgermeister is a German mayor–a “City Master.”\n\nFrees was also known for providing the voice of Professor Ludwig Von Drake, Donald Duck’s paternal uncle. This character hosted episodes on the Wonderful World of Disney, as well as the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea sing-along tape.\n\nJoan Gardner as Tanta Kringle the Matriarch of the Kringle family and Kris’ adoptive mother.\n\nGardner was a voice actress that lent her voice to many characters, including Tiny Tim in “Mr Magoo’s Christmas Carol” and Bonnie in “Here Comes Peter Cottontail.”\n\nShe also played Sister Joan in our number 5 pick!\n\nRobie Lester as Miss Jessica/ Mrs. Claus\n\nLester was a voice actor and musician that often provided singing voices for characters.\n\nShe was the singing voice of Bianca in The Rescuers, and Duchess in The Aristocats.\n\nImpact/Why we chose it\n\nThere is no doubt that Santa Claus is Coming to Town is one of the most famous of the Rankin and Bass specials. It still airs every year on regular cable, and is included in holiday special collections. But why did we choose it? This special certainly has star power, with Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney, but it also is one of the most consistent in terms of its music. Sure, there are a couple strange-ish songs, like when Mrs. Claus realizes her love for Kris, or when Kris sings about how each child must kiss him to get a gift–but those cannot undo “One Foot in Front of the Other” and “First toy-maker to the king.”\n\nFor many children, this was their first exposure to the lore behind Santa Claus. And although some explanations for Santa were written specifically for this special, there is something to be said for introducing children to the more mythical side of the man that brings them presents every Christmas. There are different Santa origin stories from all over the world, and this shows children that he doesn’t belong to one just one culture, but to everyone.\n\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x72h9lf?fbclid=IwAR32SSYD1MM4OJPzUQkb1lnEIgObfW4_upYy7jY5_Ir1aoSBdgZM51C-1Ww\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nFROSTY THE SNOWMAN\n\nRankin and Bass’s most popular cell-animated Christmas special aired on December 7, 1969 on CBS.\n\nIt was based on the song, “Frosty the Snowman,” written by Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson.\n\nThe song was originally performed by Gene Autry, but has since been covered by countless artists. Autry and the songwriters were hoping for a hit as big as “Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,” but the song unfortunately didn’t achieve the same level of popularity.\n\nWe covered the history of the song in last year’s episode, “A Brief Case in the Snow, man!” So please give that a listen if you would like to hear more about how the song came to be.\n\nJust as a refresher, some believe the song was based on a snowman character created by author Ruth Burman. Songwriter Jack Rollins said it was inspired by his step-granddaughter, who cried after her snowman melted overnight.\n\nThe special follows Frosty, a snowman brought to life by the magical hat of a failing magician named Professor Hinkle. After seeing what the hat is capable of, Hinkle tries to steal it back and pursues Frosty and a young girl named Karen as they attempt to travel to the North Pole, in search of a place where Frosty will never melt.\n\nThis was not the first time someone animated Frosty, as United Productions of America made a 5 minute animated short to the song 15 years earlier!\n\nMaking of\n\nRankin and Bass wanted the special to look like a greeting card, so the characters were designed by Paul Coker Jr, an incredibly talented artist whose illustrations appeared in Mad Magazine, and on Hallmark cards. After Frosty, Coker continued to work with Rankin and Bass for years, often designing cover art and promotional material.\n\nThe animation supervisor was Steve Nakagawa, who had the same role for “The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians” and “The Smokey the Bear Show,” two more Rankin and Bass productions.\n\nThis was not Rankin and Bass’ first cell-animated special, as they produced Cricket on the Hearth and Mouse on the Mayflower years earlier. Like all their other animation, however, it was produced in Japan.\n\nRomeo Muller, the writer known for Rudolph, Santa Claus is coming to town, and many other Rankin and Bass specials and shows, adapted the story from the popular song.\n\nStarring\n\nThis special was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, a well-known musician and actor, and this was reportedly his last performance.\n\nDurante had covered the song years earlier, but had to re-record it specifically for the special. The original song didn’t mention anything about Christmas, but since this needed to be specifically a Christmas special, the lyrics were changed to say, “He waved Good-bye saying, ‘don’t you cry, I’ll be back on Christmas day.”\n\nComedian Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty\n\nAlthough Frosty was well-known before the special, Jackie Vernon really gave Frosty his warm and loving personality. Now it’s impossible to think of the character without imagining his jolly voice exclaiming, “Happy Birthday!”\n\nVernon’s portrayal of Fros"
