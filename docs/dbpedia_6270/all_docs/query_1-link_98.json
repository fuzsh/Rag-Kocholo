        "text": ".\n\nBy Roderick Heath\n\nJump to review index\n\nJump to Favourite Films of 2023 List\n\nAs a wise man once said, your focus determines your reality. Depending on where one focused on the cinema scene in 2023, it could be described as both a singularly dire and tremendous year in film. Perhaps no recent year has gone by with so many weak and disposable big movie releases, and the survey of current day Hollywood and attached entertainment industries started to feel a little like the last act of a Martin Scorsese gangster film. Once-lucrative scams and ploys suddenly started coming undone, with streaming services that don’t make money vampirically draining out the commercial vitality of cinema, whilst movie studios who don’t like or comprehend their audience saw their franchises all ran out of steam at the worst possible moment. Or perhaps the better likeness was the atomic weapon set off in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, given how many bombs went off this year, each and every one a crater gouged in what’s left of cinema’s stature. Grand old heroes like Indiana Jones and Ethan Hunt and the Fast and Furious team and vaguely recognisable young heroes like The Flash and Shazam and Captain Marvel were all united in being greeted with a collective yawn and shrug from the public, mostly happy to wait for things to come online. That a shift in the zeitgeist was ushered in by the long years of pandemic was plain enough but the movies being released were often incidentally oblivious to it, still playing to the mores and social media arguments of 2019.\n\nThe mass audience made a show of not being wedged when it came to the choice between the serious, manly business of Oppenheimer and the frolicsome feminism of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, and the success of the latter suddenly spotlighted a vast, long-abandoned and scarcely charted continent of potential, whereas attempts to retrofit boy’s-toys fare like the Marvel Cinematic Universe fell hard and heavy. Speaking of which, the superhero craze of the last 20 years, if not entirely exhausted, still plainly ran out of steam big time, and suddenly the question of what will be the next cash cow arose, a question possibly if conditionally and hardly reassuringly answered by the huge success of Barbie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The suddenly opened frontiers of the latest generation of pattern-and-data-amassing and remixing software – sorry, “Artificial Intelligence” – that preoccupied many saw synthetic bad guys stepping to the fore, like the murderous android posing as the ultimate poptimist pal in M3gan and the sinisterly orchestrating intelligence sported in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nFloundering artists and creatives with messy personal lives were all over the place in the year’s films, hinting at the way being creative in the current world has become an absurd limbo even as the pandemic experience made the usual isolation of artists seem like a general existential state. Writers found in Afire, American Fiction, Asteroid City, Infinity Pool, Past Lives, and Anatomy of a Fall were emotionally cordoned beings caught in the eddy of their perpetual observational remove, social uncertainty, and habits of insular meditation failing to contend with speed the real world moves at; characters in films like Ferrari, Showing Up, Maestro, Passages, M3gan, The Blue Caftan, May December, and even Oppenheimer and Barbie struggled to make sense of themselves through creation, the making of an artwork or article a brief deliverance from all churning confusion and unease. In partial contrast, the triumphs and tumbles of businesspeople in the recent past lined up to be glorified in the likes of Tetris, BlackBerry, Air, and Ferrari, the stories behind the making, and sometimes the undoing, of famous marques involving twists of out-on-a-limb inspiration and risk-reward balancing acts that sometimes paid off and sometimes came to a literally crashing halt, leaving behind little more than a good-looking chassis.\n\nSimulacra of women went searching for self-actualisation in Barbie, M3gan, El Conde, and Poor Things, as did more substantial women in Boston Strangler, A Good Person, The Royal Hotel, Showing Up, Polite Society, No One Will Save You, and Eileen. Reality itself defied some protagonists – the isolated heroine of Enys Men toggled through a multitude of ages, trying to find some availing moment to get a purchase on; the children of Skinamarink roamed a shadowy house riddled with mysterious forces; the paltry antihero of Infinity Pool learned boldness and reclaimed pathos when seeing his own doppelganger put to death before plunging into a psychedelic morass. The Flash tried to rewrite personal history and instead broke the universe and condemned himself to franchise junction hell. Misbegotten creations of amoral father figures with their Faustian projects proliferated, from the tormented chimera in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to the tattooed avenging angel in God Is A Bullet, the lurching pumpkin-headed monsters of Dark Harvest and the possessed robots of Five Nights At Freddy’s and the protean heroine of Poor Things, a pattern inverted for The Creator with its harassed and hunted progeny of a post-human dawn and a martyred matriarch.\n\nBiopics were preoccupied with the mythos of famous men all connected by mysterious genius and an incapacity to keep it in their pants, and the women with varying levels of luck who loved them. Some, like Napoleon and The Legend and Butterfly, mischievously contemplated the idea the legendary conquerors they depicted were in large part the constructed products of the ambition and talent of their wives, male equivalents of the tacked-together women of Barbie and Poor Things. Napoleon, Oppenheimer, Ferrari, and Bradley Cooper’s Leonard Bernstein portrait Maestro depicted tunnel-vision ability and obsession that gave birth to things of greatness but also laid waste to much. Such portraits nonetheless came draped in the glamour of a bygone period that was less socially free and easy but feels increasingly romantic in the allure of its cultural and intellectual vivacity compared the angrily self-hobbling present-tense, an allure also tapped by the fictional world of Asteroid City. Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon didn’t deal with anyone that famous but also took on real history and laid bare its entrails both the interest of the anatomist and the prognostication of the mystic, quaking for the past and fretting for the future. The scared weird little guys made their plays for riches and escape or even mere self-respect in films like The Delinquents, Tetris, BlackBerry, Godzilla Minus One, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Dark Harvest, whilst schemers with varying levels of criminal intent made their play to cut off a slice in Saltburn, The Delinquents, and Napoleon. Amidst all of 2023’s chaotic lovers, greedy sensualists, and self-destructive seekers, Perfect Days portrayed a character who seemed, at least on the surface, to be their polar opposite.\n\nThe continuing and lucrative appeal of horror movies has been one of the few sturdy pillars of the current cinema scene, even if by and large their quality left something to be desired. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett resumed their exhumation of the Scream series with Scream VI, shifting the setting to New York and climes of contemporary collegians, as the two Carpenter sisters, once more played by Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, faced down yet another cabal of Ghostface-worshipping killers stalking them and their friends, this time with the cinephile element proving a major aspect of the story rather than meta sauce, as the series and the series-within-a-series Stab kept toggling back and forth in layers of franchise self-reference. This entry delivered a decent variation on the usual opening slaying of a chosen victim played by a familiar face, in this case Samara Weaving as a luckless film studies teacher, which unfolded intriguingly amidst busy, glitzy Manhattan. It also wisely brought back Hayden Panettiere’s Kirby, now evolved into a slightly cracked FBI agent, to take over as representative of the series legacy. These better aspects couldn’t paper over the way the new filmmaking team just don’t have the malicious wit in staging as Wes Craven, nor the scripts the fleet and witty zing of the early films. The movie ticked off all the usual meta flourishes and the evolving intergenerational theme and only just resisted the urge to ice the one remaining original cast member. But the new youth crew, for all their more self-consciously diverse makeup, are mostly pretty damn insipid and interchangeable – and early scenes introduced them in a manner that made them nearly as disturbing as the killers – and the climax devolved into a confused and tired roundelay of stabbings. Again I was left feeling like it would be my last go-round with the series, but I’ll probably say that after watching the next one too.\n\nI didn’t think it possible, after 2022’s The Invitation, for contemporary spins on Dracula to get much worse, but 2023 proved me wrong by giving me not one but two clumsily revisionist variations that seized upon often neglected elements of the source material and tried to expand them into standalone stories. Chris McKay’s Renfield was a nominal comedy-horror entry for which the central selling point was the seemingly inspired casting of Nicholas Cage as a particularly sardonic take on the sanguinary Count. Nicholas Hoult was his oppressed minion, having in this take survived in uneasy partnership to the present day, with the haplessly servile Renfield granted a small share of vampiric power granted by his master. Renfield eventually learned to stand up to Dracula, who was presented as the archetypal abusive boss, after he fell in love with a strident female cop. Not a bad satiric idea in theory. In practice McKay let the blood run free in his attempts to be outrageous and cover up the lack of real wit and cleverness, turning the concept into a sort of gore-comedy-flecked superhero movie when it should have been a much more uneasy, subtle, cultish affair of the type Cage used to make a few times a year back in the late 1980s. Even the one, good, shocking twist, when Dracula murdered all of Renfield’s support group, was undone by movie’s end.\n\nBy contrast, André Øvredal’s The Last Voyage of the Demeter saw the Troll Hunter director adopting a more serious tack on the Dracula mythos, splitting off a portion of Dracula the novel usually neglected or skipped by filmmakers – the chapters depicting Dracula’s voyage to England, slowly decimating the crew of the title ship along the way and concluding with the famous image of the dead captain tied to his steering wheel. Around this kernel of mystique the screenwriters added plenty of “fresh” flourishes to fill out a necessarily unresolved narrative. The film looked good, at least in its early stages before retreating into digital murk, but the poor script (replete with lines like “Now we know where the Devil sleeps!”) and Øvredal’s direction conspired to create a movie at once impatient and overlong, caking Stoker’s work in current-day horror movie clichés. Whilst the film seemed to be trying to draw out Stoker’s influence on later narratives like Alien and The Thing, it utterly failed to generate any sense of the hallucinatory and existential dread the source sketched so deftly, reduced its feral, animalistic Dracula to a typical CGI fiend, and couldn’t even stick to its own supposed brief of presenting the title voyage in clean isolation and faithfulness, proffering a potentially interesting but entirely unconvincing Black Van Helsing-wannabe as protagonist. What it had, rather, was an array of overripe performances: Liam Cunningham, as the ill-fated captain, kept it afloat, but was still rather wasted.\n\nFor quite a different spin on the Stoker’s character and the vampire mystique one could turn to Pablo Larrain’s El Conde. After plodding about in strained, award-chic, quasi-feminist circles for his last couple of movies, Larrain steered back to the kind of material that provides the bedrock of his sensibility in again harking back to the grand old days of the Chilean junta with an added dose of symbolic-satirical conceit: El Conde implied a double meaning in its title, proposing it was a favoured nickname for Chile’s former military ruler Augusto Pinochet. Larrain posited that Pinochet was actually a nefarious vampire who emerged from the milieu of the French Revolution and set about resisting all forms of revolution, finding the ideal stage to do so when he washed up in Chile. After his nominal “death” Pinochet, who had let himself wane into a semblance of old age, set about trying to restore his youth, with a particularly tempting goad to his efforts in the form of a beautiful nun posing as an accountant, sent to destroy him and restore the wealth he purloined, whilst his family scurries to grab their slice. El Conde was somehow a return to form for Larrain but also a seriously mixed bag. Both the storyline and the lines of satiric enquiry felt clumsy and undeveloped, although its most inspired joke – bringing in the equally undead Margaret Thatcher and revealing her brand of first world Tory to be the literal and figurative parent of the Latin American dictator – came delivered with mordant wit and biting import. The gorgeous black-and-white photography infused Larrain’s occasionally powerful images, particularly when the newly vampirised nun revelled in weightless release and communion with the delight of evil, even if Larrain ultimately revealed little clear idea of what it all meant beyond a long reiteration of Bertholt Brecht’s epigram about Hitler and the bitch that bore him.\n\nElizabeth Banks’ Cocaine Bear also laboured to churn together blood-soaked genre business with waggish humour and mordant, nostalgic satire – even if the targets this time were far more nebulous – in spinning a zany chase-and-chomp thriller from an old tabloid headline with the most does-what-it-says-on-the-box title since Snakes On A Plane. The period in reference was, as so often at the moment, the 1980s, as a bear gets coked to the gills after munching on a load of yéyo from a crashed drug smugglers’ plane, and, driven to frenzy, terrorises a survey of luckless people drawn to a US national park for varying motives. Said walking lunches included Keri Russell as a mother trying to locate her daughter before the marauding beast, Alden Ehrenreich as a fed-up factotum in the drug ring, and Ray Liotta, in his last role, as the bullying kingpin. Banks didn’t take the material at all seriously, with a punchline that affirmed different versions of momma bear fierceness and protectiveness. But Banks’ touch as a filmmaker remains pretty slapdash, as the movie lurched uneasily between silliness and earnest violence with endemic clumsiness in staging, delivering neither queasy laughs or genuine tension beyond the most basic, and the whole thing came dressed in a kind of self-conscious naughtiness that made me wish I’d watched Grizzly again.\n\nDespite its epic science fiction backdrop, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods’ 65 proved to be a variation on the same basic theme of being lost in the woods with a big toothy animal stalking you, albeit this one enfolding in the last days of the dinosaurs. Adam Driver was the emissary of a humanoid race exploring deep space who, after the ship he’s piloting crashes on a primeval Earth just before a species-decimating asteroid hits, finds himself stranded along with one fellow survivor, a young girl who reminds him a whole lot of his deceased daughter, and the two battle their way to a rescue craft with various carnivores in pursuit. Driver trying his hand at anchoring a meat-and-potatoes action-adventure flick was a welcome sight, and it started reasonably well, with a long, near-wordless passage of his hero stranded alone on a fearsome alien world and faced with a race to keep himself alive, all decorated with some eye-appeasing visual textures. But 65 ultimately proved a listless, cavernously empty retread of a dozen better movies: the boldness of the basic narrative conceit proved only to be a pretext for a predictable, schmaltzy tale of daddy-daughter angst, and culminated in a uniquely pointless and silly battle with a hungry tyrannosaurus.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected movie credit of the year was seeing Ben Wheatley’s name attached as director of Meg 2: The Trench, a belated sequel to Jon Turteltaub’s mildly amusing giant shark movie of 2018. Jason Statham and several other members of the original cast returned to be imperilled when another expedition into the depths of the Mariana Trench results in disaster and stranding on the sea floor, contending this time not just with megalodons but other prehistoric nasties as well as human villains. Wheatley did seem to be bent on having some fun with the material, wielding imagery that grazed Jules Verne territory as well as The Abyss and touching on Wheatley’s love of psychedelic plant life as his heroes trekked through a sunken fluorescent garden before entering a mysterious underwater base used by nefarious persons. Ultimately however Wheatley didn’t even seem particularly bent on transforming a commercial venture into an auteurist delight, with the film by and large offering the same blend of blandly sufficient action and comedy as the first. The second half again depicted an assault on a resort filled with rich Chinese tourists, and, like 65, the story boiled down to a daddy looking out for a rambunctious daughter, with some kind of thematic import arising from him and his adopted daughter’s Chinese uncle amicably divvying up protector duties. Maybe Peter Strickland or Joanna Hogg would like to tackle the third one.\n\nBrian Duffield’s No One Will Save You proved a stranger and, at least initially, arresting blend of familiar sci-fi and monster movie tropes with something more ambitious and rarefied. Kaitlyn Dever played a young woman living alone amidst a community that hates and ostracises her for reasons that slowly come into focus. One night she encounters an alien that enters her house and accidentally kills it during a struggle, and soon finds she could be the last person not assimilated into the ranks of those controlled by the aliens. Duffield’s boldest choice was to let the film play out as almost dialogue-free and telling the story as much through imagery as possible. Given the debt of the images to manifold influences from Robert Heinlein to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I was left feeling that wasn’t nearly as much an achievement as the film thought it was, and the absence of speaking mostly just made room for a lot of running about and game-playing, nominally that of human and aliens but really that of the director and audience, with the aliens proving conveniently very selective about when they can use their vast powers. The more cumulatively irritating aspect of the film was the way it obeyed the current playbook of the elevated genre film, with climactic scenes boiling everything down to a meditation on grief and guilt, with a punchline where the perplexed aliens seemed to rewrite reality so Duffield could claim a late swerve into David Lynch-esque territory, but in a manner that felt less truly surreal than like a sop to a very contemporary sensibility where if you don’t like the reality you live in you can curate your life feed so it matches your headspace.\n\nTalk To Me, made by Australian director siblings Danny and Michael Phillipou, tackled a tale of supernatural haunting and possession in a more familiar fashion than No One Will Save You, but with the same essential thematic concern. Talk To Me revolved around a high school girl, still mourning her mother’s suicide, who finds herself caught in a spiral of possibly demonic influence when she and some friends have a party where the latest source of thrill-seeking entertainment is a plaster cast of a hand, supposedly that of a dead medium: this totem allows one’s body to be inhabited by a spirit for a short time, and the heroine’s emotional neediness proves to be the key to some dark and malign force seizing control of a friend, with the wronged dead gleefully acting out their rage towards the living. Talk To Me’s banal Aussie suburban setting and focus on teenage dares and rites of passage as a suitable place to root a study of anxiety and self-subverting efforts at moving on from tragedy was initially intriguing and grounded, with a particularly good performance from Miranda Otto as the canny mother of two of the teens. But the bug-eyed manifestations of possession and other, literal and generic flourishes to assure the general audience that yes, this was a horror movie, robbed it of the chance to be a subtle and disturbing study in a disintegrating psyche, and the kind of storyline that’s best articulated in a short story was dragged out somewhat as a feature film. More aggravatingly, the film’s exploitation of the kind of mental health drama it tried to piggyback its supposed seriousness upon felt a bit exploitative and, by the end, cruel.\n\nJulius Avery’s The Pope’s Exorcist was by contrast emblematic of the modern Hollywood horror film, charged with gaudy, pumped-up spectacle in dealing with the notion of demonic possession, without any hint of subtlety or tension beyond a rollercoaster barrage of special effects and big acting. Russell Crowe continued his recent genre quickie slumming with seeming contentment, playing a character vaguely based on real life Vatican priest Gabriele Amorth, a Vespa-riding, bureaucrat-defying, practical psychology-wielding ass-kicker for the Lord. Amorth journeys to Spain to intervene in a supernatural assault on a recently transplanted American family, and finds himself contending with a bole of ancient evil eager to test his talents at compelling with the power of Christ. The film’s extremely flimsy based-on-a-true story pretext didn’t extend to being specific about which Pope exactly Amorth was exorcist-ing for, with Franco Nero playing what could only be called Generic Pope, and a fuzzy period setting that was nominally the late 1980s. As with Avery’s previous Overlord, The Pope’s Exorcist was essentially an exercise in harvesting and melding manifold clichés, mostly in this case lifted from William Friedkin’s 1973 ür-text for the subgenre, from suddenly terrible teens with croaky voices to demonic conspiracies designed to test the faith of the guilt-ridden priest. The result was executed with just enough gusto to be moderately enjoyable even if it left you feeling like you should say a few Hail Marys for watching it.\n\nA long time ago, when he made 30 Days of Night, David Slade seemed like a potential new star of horror filmmaking, and the prospect of his resurgence with Dark Harvest, adapted from a well-regarded novel, seemed promising. Dark Harvest’s subject was an isolated town somewhere out in the vastness of the Midwestern wheat belt, in the early 1960s. There a peculiar yearly social custom has developed, demanding the teenage boys of the town risk their lives each Halloween to kill a marauding supernatural entity called Sawtooth Jack, whose rise is in turn propagated by the city elders in an obscure but deadly earnest ritual to stave off failed crops. The champion who brings down Jack is supposedly rewarded with freedom and their family enriched, but the younger brother of the previous year’s champion smells a rat and resolves to take part, forming an alliance with a plucky Black girl who’s new in town. The storyline worked to fuse the disparate influence of Shirley Jackson and Stephen King on modern American horror with its blend of Americana and stark metaphors for totemic deeds in communal life, with dashes of The Wicker Man and The Hunger Games for good measure. Dark Harvest had real potential, but Slade’s touch proved to have entirely deserted him, delivering a choppily-told, obviously-played tale, provoking tension but more in a frustrated, when-will-this-end way rather than exciting. Slade had no feel for the period setting, and gave only cursory portrayal of how the town’s peculiar atmosphere and social structure manifested. Most of the young protagonists were barely defined and hard to tell apart, and Slade built to an ending which clumsily rewrote the source, including offering the resolution proper in a scene needlessly inserted after the end credits started rolling. The performance by Luke Kirby, playing the town’s thuggish cop and chief enforcer of The Way Things Are, seemed to be aiming for the same kind of stylised bravura that made Jeffrey Combs a horror cult hero, but only achieved extreme irritation.\n\nIn a year of movies replete with malign robots and artificial intelligences, Emma Tammi’s Five Nights At Freddy’s also expanded a peculiar recent subgenre obsessed with exploring the sinister side of commercialised childhood iconography. Tammi, who suggested some talent with 2019’s The Wind even if the movie fell apart on her, returned to score a bona fide hit with a big screen take on a popular video game series, co-written by the game creator Scott Cawthon. Josh Hutcherson played a fraying young man, trying to care for his much younger sister but fatefully tormented by the memory of another sibling’s kidnapping and supposed murder. Our hero accepts from desperation a job as security guard at an abandoned former 1980s theme restaurant, and soon finds it inhabited by a gang of animatronic mascots with a murderous bent, but also a plaintive secret that must be understood before both he and his sister fall victim to them, with a local female cop proving suspiciously alert and sympathetic to their situation. The plotting of Five Nights At Freddy’s bore little scrutiny – I suspect if I spent too much energy trying to make sense of it, like how the hero managed to explain all the mayhem including his aunt’s murder – I might risk having a stroke. But it proved a modestly enjoyable and unpretentious pop horror outing, with Tammi swapping out the games’ signature jump scares for a stab at a more measured creepiness, with surprisingly minimal gore. Whilst it was inferior to M3gan as a movie, this one grasped something interesting and elusive in regards to the strange pathos of objects designed to please kids but then left to decay, made out of cynical motives and yet invested with a faintly haunting echo of lost childhood fancies, a motif amplified cleverly by making the robotic mascots vessels of lost children themselves, in a kind of updated take on M.R. James’ “Lost Hearts.” Also fun seeing Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard in supporting parts of note.\n\nFive Nights At Freddy’s notably and cruelly beat out David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer for the horror hit of the Halloween season. Green tried to transfer his success with his revivalist Halloween trilogy to another well-worn genre property, casting Leslie Odom Jr as a man who, after losing his wife in an earthquake during a visit to Haiti and raising their now-teenaged daughter alone in Savannah, Georgia, is driven frantic when she and a school friend vanish after conducting a séance, only for them to turn up days later, exhibiting signs of demonic possession. Faced with a schism between his own scepticism and the religious faith of the second girl’s parents and other people around him, he tracked down Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) for aid, and eventually tries a kind of ecumenical exorcism. Green showed some signs in the early stages of wanting to emulate William Friedkin’s original in terms of a reasonably slow, mood-setting, grounded approach. The revelation that Chris had become a 1980s daytime talk show fixture flogging a demonic possession memoir and reinventing herself as an exorcism guru felt stunningly apt. All for nought, given this degenerated into one of the most putrid disasters not just of the year but of recent years. One basic problem came from an unwillingness to accept the essential premise of the original, operating as it did, however much skill in character and milieu Friedkin and William Peter Blatty wrapped it in, from a particular, sectarian viewpoint. Incredibly incompetent efforts on both a script level, to explore intersections of faith and disparities in fateful choice, and on a stylistic one, didn’t help, nor did Green failing to offer anything even vaguely original in terms of exorcism action. Even the concluding fillip of letting us see Burstyn and Linda Blair together again after fifty years was no recompense.\n\nMohawk director Ted Geoghegan returned with Brooklyn 45, a chamber piece horror-drama with an immediately intriguing hook. Several veterans of the recently ended World War II, all of them friends and most with hard and troubling wartime experiences behind them, congregate in the Brooklyn home of a General (Larry Fessenden) in the last days of 1945. The General wants to conduct a séance to contact his wife, who died from suicide after a period of paranoid raving about her German neighbours being Nazi spies. After seeming to contact his wife’s spirit, the gathering find themselves in the company of both unquiet spirits that won’t let them leave the room, and of one those German neighbours, who had been drugged and imprisoned, and the question as to whether she really might be a spy proves immaterial to those who want to shoot her simply to satisfy lingering hate and xenophobia. Despite the period setting the real topic here was USA in the Trumpian, post-War on Terror era, trying to say something about the lingering effects of war and the notion of people being whipped up to increasing lunacy by an (this time literally) undead leader. The film suffered from similar problems to Mohawk, although it was a slight improvement on that: overripe acting and a potent whiff of hipster self-congratulation in the carefully arranged social commentary, with one overt choice of complication – refusing to answer the question as to whether the neighbour really was a Nazi – matched to a total lack of finesse in the characterisations and their varying angsts otherwise. The script eventually painted itself into a truly awkward corner, delivering a climax that failed to convince on any level.\n\nBishal Dutta’s It Lives Inside revolved around an Indian-American teenager. Alienated from both her mother, who insists on always speaking Hindi, and her childhood friend, who’s gone weird and unkempt, she’s trying to get on with being the average, assimilated girl, but soon finds, when she breaks the jar her old pal insists on carrying around fretfully and believes contained a trapped demon, that some alarming truths about her heritage are about to kick into relevance hard. It Lives Inside was certainly an attempt to yoke together recent templates for emergent genre film success: the story was built around the kind of remorseless, metaphorically charged demonic persecutor besetting a hapless heroine seen in the likes of The Babadook, It Follows, and Smile, with an added frame of Jordan Peele-era cultural angst as the heroine was obliged to embrace her cultural background to stand a chance of surviving her ordeal. The film’s concerns also intersected with 2023 stablemates Polite Society also in theme of a young Desi woman gripped by rebellious tendencies, and Talk To Me in depicting a haunting that invokes deep personal pain and teenage nightmares. Early scenes promised yet another wearying parade of obvious point-scoring about the immigrant experience, as our heroine tried to make nice with a clueless classmate, and the upshot of the finale was maybe just a little too cute in affirming friendship and personal pride as the keys to bottling evil. It Lives Inside proved better than a lot of the stuff it resembled, however, as the script threw a few nifty curveballs and allowed supporting characters to surprise with shows of emotional depth, and when finally revealed the monster was nicely old-school. Dutta had a strong directorial touch, making the most of a supernatural threat for which mischievous torment was part of the job description.\n\nCanadian Kyle Edward Ball made his feature debut with Skinamarink, a genuinely odd, even unique distillation of the baseline emotions and atmosphere of horror cinema, delivered via an experimental film style. The obliquely hinted narrative portrayed two young children who at first appear to have been left alone in their house, sometime after one has had a sleepwalking accident. During a seemingly endless night, it becomes clear that they’re being tormented by a mysterious entity that can make objects move, mimic their parents, and distort not just the house but the nature of reality itself – or is it all merely the dreamscape of childhood? Ball’s aesthetic pursuit could be described as an attempt to boil those scenes from Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist when Carol Anne communes with the TV static in the dark house down to an abstracted membrane, whilst aiming to nail down that sensation, common it seems to most childhoods, of when we first become aware of our environs beyond the demarcations of quotidian rhythms, and every shadow seems to contain some presence leering back at us – a sort of Wendigo Syndrome of infant experience. On that level, Skinamarink was intriguing, sometimes even mesmerising, particularly as Ball’s photography shifted from a quasi-found-footage style (complete with faked film grain) to moments of more defined surrealist strangeness, and he used old public domain cartoons to both offset and intensify the mood of somnambulist alienation. Still, trying to stretch out this aesthetic – even calling it a premise feels exaggerated – to 100 minutes felt unnecessary, with much of the film proving repetitious. Occasional sops of horror imagery like glimpses of gnarled faces and weird things twitching in the gloom provided jolting pay-offs to the glaze of drawn-out anxiety but also, in a curious way, felt like violations of the rules of this particular game.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves saw writer-director duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein trying to forge a proper story out of the ever-popular role-playing game, that cultural pillar and rite of passage for so much of modern geekdom. Chris Pine’s gift for purveying old-school movie star stuff with a self-satirising glint was smartly exploited as he played Edgin, a hero-turned-criminal-turned-hero-again trying to win back his daughter and defeat an evil sorceress with his band of magical misfits. Daley and Goldstein twisted like yoga masters to at once please game aficionados whilst also amusing those indifferent to the source material. The result as a whole was mildly amusing and decent fun, even if in look it was undistinguished from the vast array of CGI-crusted quasi-medieval fantasies, apart from one bravura sequence involving Sophia Lillis’ shapeshifter, and both the humour and heart it tried to stoke stemmed from a kind of writing that can be found in any number of recent film and TV takes on dorky, motormouthed screw-ups. To their credit, however, Daley and Goldstein worked to not just make clever use of the game’s tropes and mechanics but to incorporate its cultural function and cultish appeal, its reputation as a haven for outsiders who all have to find ways to wield their own best capacities. Tropes of the game, like the magically transporting hither-thither staff, were utilised as goals or accidental discoveries to then be wielded creatively. Regé-Jean Page’s heartthrob aura was amusingly exploited in playing an insufferably noble do-gooder, Hugh Grant had some fun as the smarmy and devious subaltern villain, and Daisy Head was striking as his boss, the maniacal sorceress who jolted the film into a more serious mode for the finale.\n\nTakashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One was the latest expansion of the ever-sprawling Godzilla mythos, returning the big fella not just to the land of his intellectual birth but also to the era and milieu he emerged from: Japan in the wake of World War II. In this semi-remake, Ryunosuke Kamiki played Shikishima, a fighter pilot who wimped out of both completing a glorious mission in the waning days of the war and also shooting up Godzilla when he attacked an air force base in his pre-mutation days. Wracked with guilt, he returns to a bombed-out Tokyo and builds something like a life with a young woman and a foundling he takes in whilst working with a motley crew of fellow veterans on a minesweeper. Shikishima gets his chance for redemption, and also raw revenge, when he seems to lose what little he has to the newly radiation-engorged and seemingly unstoppable monster when it crashes upon Japanese shores. Yamazaki, an experienced director who made the surprisingly decent Space Battleship Yamato (2010) and knows his way around retro patriotic guff, wielded honourable purpose with Godzilla Minus One with his desire to recapture some of the gravitas and immediacy of metaphor that made Ishiro Honda’s original film so lasting, and take seriously the human drama at the heart of this take on the tale, even as he shifted emphasis away from atomic bomb anxiety to explore the mindset of the beaten nation, as well as offering some inferences about its potential role today. It’s not too hard to see why many found Godzilla Minus One particularly appealing on the current movie scene, as a straightforward redemption saga where the personal angst and jingoistic drama were dovetailed, with swipes at government secrecy and cynicism to counterbalance the noble warrior stuff, and an odd emphasis on private enterprise as the best answer to the problem. But the film’s virtues have also been rather overblown, with disappointingly little by way of real ferocity and memorable spectacle to the monster action or cleverness to the story, and the interpersonal stuff was only substantial when dealing with Shikishima, with the supporting characters granted little detail or vivacity.\n\nOver in straight-no-chaser action movie land, Jean-François Richet’s Plane saw Gerard Butler playing one of his stalwart hero parts, this time an airline pilot who finds his former military training extremely useful when he’s forced to make an emergency landing with his planeload of stock types on an island controlled by gangsters, making uneasy partnership with a passenger whose skills for hellraising are more freshly honed, and with only the small problem that he’s a prisoner under escort. Plane provoked an oddly fork-tongued response in me, at once making me wish it had tried just a little bit harder to set up both its characters and action in such a way as to give them the gravitas of a classic action movie in this zone rather than the kind of straightforward sufficiency that’s rife in our glorious new content age. But I also can’t deny that anyone looking for a solid, uncomplicated and satisfying action flick dialling through the choices on their streaming service would find Plane a pretty ideal choice, distinguished by Richet’s punchy staging and a decent cast. There was also a faint glimmer of something fresh in the way that, whilst the airline’s penny-pinching led to the grounding, not all of the bosses were portrayed as amoral creeps.\n\nThe series everyone except me seems to have felt held the rank of supreme action movie franchise in recent years came to an apparent end with Chad Stahelski’s John Wick: Chapter 4, a would-be epic climax again starring Keanu Reeves as the raging superassassin. This time the so-called story stretched out the quasi-class war aspect of his conflict with the all-powerful cadre of bosses called the High Table to hyperbolic extremes. Whilst series stalwarts Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and Lance Reddick bobbed around the fringes, Bill Skarsgard was wearisomely arch as the French nobleman who appoints himself Wick’s opponent in a duel to end the lasting quarrel, whilst trying to make sure Wick never makes the date by rousing entire armies of underworld killers to take him out. Chapter 4 started well, in large part thanks to Donnie Yen’s presence as a blind but preternaturally great foil for Wick, and Rina Sawayama as a conscientious daughter ready to go ninja-nuclear on a dime. The early, extended setpiece in Osaka would have been more than sufficient as a climax. But the film’s absurd running time was not earned by a plethora of supporting characters serving no real function save setting up hoped-for franchise segues, and endless, well-staged but finally downright boring scenes of an endless supply of anonymous thugs getting iced. The film was very, very pretty – and very, very empty, rather too fitting as a coda for a series that perversely built its popularity around stripping out the skeleton of melodrama that’s vital to investment in action fare, and Chapter 4, whilst plainly hoping to break through into a zone of self-sustaining absurdity, felt like a jackhammer with a jammed-on switch. Stahelski cheerfully confirmed his Walter Hill fandom by incorporating brazen riffs on The Warriors, and reconfirmed that his eye is truly excellent, even if finally wasted here.\n\nBrett Donowho’s The Old Way was a more classical variation on hallowed Western film motifs, but with a particular, fashionable modern concern as its focus. Nicolas Cage played Colton Briggs, a version of a common genre type of antihero, the once-infamously ruthless gunman who’s retired and become a family man after finding the love of a good woman. This came with a specific twist of characterisation, signalling Colton is neurodivergent, his life defined first by efforts to mimic the behaviour of other people and then more often by his callous indifference to them before he found someone who finally plugged him in: his young daughter seems to have inherited some version of the same trait. When his wife is slain by the vengeful son of a man he killed years before, father and daughter set out together to track down this special enemy. Cage’s presence undoubtedly elevated the film, which hinged upon the mildly mortifying idea of his caring but coolly expedient father offering his daughter hard lessons in frontier justice. The most memorable moment came when Colton delivered a monologue bemoaning his lifetime of confusion and bitterness from dealing with his incomprehension of other humans, a vignette from Cage walking a fine line between subtle comedy and pathos. Otherwise The Old Way was merely a solid enough time-waster, with its digital glossiness and overall air of cheapness, and storyline that never found any particular, clever way of utilising its one distinguishing dramatic element to deviate the otherwise straightforward genre story.\n\nLouis Leterrier was given the job of steering the Fast and Furious series towards a promised epic climax, with Fast X. This one harkened back to series highpoint Fast Five: Jason Mamoa played the son of that film’s Brazilian cartel kingpin, a vengeful, crazy, florid personality seeking to trap and destroy all the members of the now very extended and oft-resurrected Torretto clan. New components included Brie Larson as the tough-as-nails daughter of Kurt Russell’s Mr X and Daniela Melchior as the crop-top-fond sister of some character I don’t remember; around them swirled just about all the series regulars. Fast X saw Leterrier not only resisting taking the material too seriously but pushing it with an edge of cartoonishness the series never quite dipped to before, over-indulging Mamoa’s weird hambone performance as the supposedly terrifying Machiavellian psycho who insisted on acting, whilst drawing out his project of payback, like the personification of the internet, indulging wacky violence and playful gender-bending for no particular reason. The storyline also insisted on separating the heroes, with some kept far off on the margins, like Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty, stuck with Charlize Theron’s galvanisingly icy Cipher, trying to escape an Arctic black-site prison together. Vin Diesel seemed a little more engaged than usual as his Dom was pushed to the wall by his foe’s efforts, but the film’s air of a franchise running on fumes (sorry) was only underlined by the tepid cliffhanger ending which didn’t exactly leave me gasping with anxiety about how Dom and Co were going to get out of this one.\n\nAnother team of beloved, close-knit heroes long familiar on movie screens, if more culturally hallowed, were dragged out for yet another spin around the track, in Martin Bourboulon’s The Three Musketeers: D’Artagnan. Bourboulon’s entry kicked off a bifurcated adaptation of Alexandre Dumas pere’s legendary novel, more or less the same in structure as Richard Lester’s 1973 version. As well as applying the lush and gritty virtues of the particularly French approach to such historical epics, Bourboulon took the material more seriously than previous editions, highlighting the religious and social schisms of the epoch and exploiting them for a more political thriller-like variant, and fleshing out the backstory of certain characters, whilst still trying to maintain the familiar, jaunty charm of the heroes. The film fell prey to a certain awkward, modern blockbuster-style hype, like Milady de Winter taking a dramatic swan dive off the cliffs of Dover, and several extended one-take fight sequences. The adaptation also proved a little jammed between classical and revisionist motifs: Eva Green’s Milady, for instance, didn’t quite get to wield the psychopathic zest of previous incarnations as the script offered some sympathy for her formative experience, whilst Romain Duris’ Aramis engaged in torture. Bourboulon still managed for the most part to pull off the balancing act, with some of the modernising touches, like making Porthos a bisexual swinger, feeling like they were always there, and the cast was more or less perfect, particularly Vincent Cassel as Athos, and despite the hesitance of her writing Green owned every scene as Milady swanned through proceedings as 17th century fashion plate femme fatale.\n\nNeil Jordan chose to tackle yet another character who still has a patina of pop culture legend even if he’s been neglected of late, with Marlowe. Jordan cast Liam Neeson as Raymond Chandler’s gumshoe knight, in a story that was, alas, adapted not from one of Chandler’s stories but from John Banville’s pseudonymous extension of the character mystique. Marlowe played in part as an origin story for its hero, who was depicted as still a relatively fresh-minted private eye just prior to The Big Sleep, as he became involved in a labyrinthine mystery involving murder, drug trafficking, and the ownership of a movie studio. Marlowe had real potential, given the strength of the cast – Jessica Lange, Diane Kruger, Colm Meaney, Alan Cumming, and Danny Huston were in there – and Jordan’s passion for noir style has pervaded his oeuvre. If all involved had made the film twenty years ago it might have been something truly memorable. As it was the result they came up with had flashes of appropriately hardboiled wit and looked good, but couldn’t stave off the feeling the whole thing was an accumulation of harvested clichés matched to revisionist tweaks that are themselves pretty hackneyed. The cast were conspicuously too old for the most part, with proceedings as a result badly lacking the necessary feeling of danger and sexiness inflecting the verbal jousting amidst the more literal jousts with villainy.\n\nAfter his flatlining venture into historical biopic with Mank, David Fincher resumed his trademark fare of nihilist noir with The Killer, even reuniting with Se7en screenwriter Andrew Kevin Waller. Michael Fassbender was the title character, one of that mythic cadre of coolly confident and utterly professional globetrotting assassins, who, after one of his hits goes awry, finds his life in danger and his hideaway and girlfriend both violated, setting him on an extended project of chastisement to ensure there will be no repetitions. Fincher’s touchstones were obvious enough – Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samourai was referenced within the first few seconds – and the antihero’s coldly fastidious approach was matched to Fincher’s filmmaking in a dance of style-as-substance that needed no decoding. Some took The Killer as a darkly witty deconstruction of the hitman mythos and the fantasy inflation of more common job-of-work experience it’s usually used to evoke. To be fair, there were flashes of that, particularly the Killer’s habit of roving around with The Smiths blasting in his ears all day, every day, in a bubble of droning detachment. And Fincher seemed to be channelling something of his frustration with the contemporary studio and streamer ethos, so hostile to his kind of operator. But whatever project Fincher had in mind, it didn’t compensate for a story that went nowhere, and a script that was never particularly funny, exciting, or rich in some other way to be worth the investment of time: instead it betrayed the spectacle of Fincher, and much of his fandom, embracing superficiality as an aesthetic value.\n\nNida Manzoor’s Polite Society was a tale of sisterly solidarity as interpreted through a lens of playful fantasy, Bollywood fetishism, and martial artistry: when a teenaged Anglo-Indian wannabe stunt woman learns her sister has dropped out of art school and resolved to marry a rich and charming doctor, she sets out to break up the union and refuses to let either of them abandon their ambitions. Soon she uncovers an insidious plot which outstrips her paranoia, thrusting her into battle less with her prospective brother-in-law than with his ferocious mother. The inspirations here were pretty blatant, particularly Edgar Wright’s films in toggling between humdrum life struggles and inflated, acrobatic action, with an overlay of pop feminist attitude. In that regard it was more spunky and agreeable than Barbie’s brand, although the narrative’s ultimate villainy lay more in a certain brand of imperious maternal will seeking to turn the next generation into clones of itself. Manzoor’s film looked good, embraced its own bratty attitude, and tapped the implicitly entertaining sight of high-kicking fung-fu action staged in full Hindu wedding regalia for all it was worth. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya as the siblings both displayed star wattage. That said, when it all added up it wasn’t really that much better or more sophisticated than, say, the rebooted St. Trinians movies of the ‘00s, with a script that didn’t quite work hard enough to transform its metaphors or develop the turns of plot, and the finale didn’t quite cut loose with crazy spectacle as much as I hoped it would.\n\nJohn Woo swung back into Hollywood action with Silent Night, a film built around the kind of storytelling gimmick that begs for cineastes to get rapturous and say things like “pure cinema” and “basically a silent film,” by which they mean there’s not much dialogue. Joel Kinnaman was Brian Godlock, a power worker whose son becomes collateral damage in a drive-by shooting as two scumbag gangs battle it out on the streets of his neighbourhood on Christmas Day, and Godlock loses his voice when he chases after the killers and gets a bullet in the throat for his pains. After a period of alcohol-soaked depression, he circles the next Christmas on the calendar with the scribbled directive to “Kill them all,” and sets about relentlessly training his body and accumulating what info and materiel he needs to go on a roaring rampage of revenge, at the cost of ending his marriage and descending into a whirlwind of slaughter he can’t possibly survive. Woo’s trademark blend of dynamic action staging and swooning emotionalism was well-matched to the demands of telling a story with as a little direct dialogue as necessary, able to invoke Brian’s anguish and then his purposeful self-transformation. The film was very enjoyable, even if it rather oddly lost some steam when the action finale arrived, with Woo, for all his bravura, feeling like a slightly bad match for the necessary brand of maniacal investment with this kind of story where unleavened hate is the driving dramatic value, and the climax proved a bit stale not in staging but in conception, as Brian fought his way up through a building through the regulation army of disposable baddies who all seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nFinnish director Jalmari Helander has forged a niche for himself as a maker of action-adventure films charged with Hollywood bravura but made and set in his native land, with a heavy dose of irony tapped in the contrasts involved. His latest effort in this vein, Sisu, depicted a heroic survivor of the Winter War with the Soviet Union who’s taken up looking for gold out in the Lapland tundra, ignoring the more recent occupation by Nazis besetting his land. When his triumphal path homeward with newfound riches collides with a Nazi convoy and its calculating commander, he is despite all drawn into a battle to the death with them, aided by some captive, abused local women. Sisu left me with mixed feelings to a degree. The initial, intriguing proposition was to focus on a game of cat-and-mouse reminiscent of John Frankenheimer’s The Train, pitting the canny, skilled, vastly outmatched hero against the evil invaders in a landscape that seems inimical to guerrilla tactics, and could have been something really thrilling if it had chosen even a slightly more grounded brand of action. But Helander settled for a tongue-in-cheek, deliberately ridiculous approach, making unsubtle nods to Inglourious Basterds and the Indiana Jones films, as his hero proved all but supernaturally invincible as the perfect incarnation of Finnish grit. The film was nonetheless highly enjoyable, and proved eventually to have a truly clever reason for mostly being played out in English by the multinational cast.\n\nSisu was also notably superior to the actual Indiana Jones film of the year: the long-delayed Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny raised furtive hopes from many that director James Mangold, taking over from Steven Spielberg, could give an aging franchise, and star, a worthy and newly vigorous farewell, much as Mangold’s Logan supposedly managed. Alas, the result proved one of the most wearisome and disheartening misfires of recent annals, despite seeming to do just about everything so many fans and critics insisted it do over the years since the last entry. We got an extended sequence of a digitally rejuvenated Harrison Ford battling good old-fashioned Nazi heavies in the waning days of World War II, in a solid but uninspired attempt to mimic the classic series style. The main storyline, mostly unfolding in 1969, put Indy back on his own again – after crudely killing off his son and estranging him from wife Marion – and then pairing him off with a new pal, in the form of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s plucky but shady goddaughter, who the film was obviously but clumsily trying to set up as a replacement-inheritor. A whole bunch of breathless yet weightless and eventually tedious running-around ensued. The project was ultimately a lumpy pastiche when it wasn’t being genuinely insulting to its hero’s hard-won gravitas and long journey in pop culture lore. The finale wimped out of killing off Indy, but the experience as a whole didn’t exactly spark new desire to see him put the hat on again.\n\nGuy Ritchie had a truly bewildering year, releasing two films within a couple of months — the much-delayed freewheeling comedy-thriller Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, and the complete tonal volte face of The Covenant, a solemn drama about the Afghanistan War. The two movies couldn’t have more acutely described the good and bad sides to Ritchie’s creative touch if they’d been made for that purpose. Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre wanted very badly to kickstart a franchise and marry The Italian Job to Mission: Impossible, as it offered some cool criminal operators who gang together to operate coolly in some shenanigans involving a doohickey and a thing with the guns and the satellites and lots of wry quips on private yachts and the like – and I see now how much impression it made on me. Jason Statham was the supposedly suave mastermind and Josh Hartnett had some fun as a Hollywood star drawn in to his world and finding himself delighted by its cast of characters. Hugh Grant was deployed for the second time in 2023 to deliver one of his sly, saggy, charming bad guy performances, but Aubrey Plaza gave proceedings what little real juice they had as the compulsory acerbic tech wiz who proved equally good toe-to-toe with the business end of the caper. Otherwise the film was an arrhythmic, tedious mess, with needless structural quirks and, apart from the odd moment when the cast plugged into the right vein of eccentric, semi-improvised humour, a lack of the spry wit it so desperately needed.\n\nThe Covenant yawed far closer in style and tone to the rigorous glaze of Wrath of Man, as the first half portrayed an American soldier (Jake Gyllenhaal), injured in an ambush, saved by his initially ambiguous-seeming Afghan translator (Dar Salim), who arduously hauls him across miles of open country. The second half was preoccupied with the American’s determined efforts after recovering Stateside to return the favour and bring the translator to the US, an effort that becomes urgent when he gets wind his friend is being hunted mercilessly by the Taliban. The Covenant had some pretences to playing as a worthy tribute to the many translators who allied with the US cause and a needling reminder of responsibility after the war’s jarring end, with a narrative structure that broadly resembled The Deer Hunter. But the movie mostly dispensed with deeper meditations on the whole sorry saga, to instead play out as a largely no-nonsense action-thriller mediated by a battle with bureaucracy played as a descent into Dante-esque hells for a traumatised and guilty warrior, and the film was both impressive and gripping for that reason, if also ultimately not all that terribly deep. Gyllenhaal and Salim did fine work as the two very different yet fatefully entangled men, and it seems these days that Ritchie is at his best when avoiding the ‘ullo guv larkishness that initially defined him.\n\n2023 proved the year when the superhero movie industrial complex finally collapsed, only about a decade since I first started predicting it, leaving swathes of smoking rubble in industry expectation and commentariat talking points: the moment it became clear that some of the popular investment endowed in this kind of movie had waned, the paradigm that just a couple of years ago ruled the movie cosmos seemed to deflate like a punctured puffer fish. The one real success story for the style was James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, borne aloft by the hard-earned investment the audience had in its characters and the relative seriousness Gunn treated them with, and still even that one underperformed to a degree. Gunn’s third entry moved in two narrative streams, one recounting the origin story of Bradley Cooper’s rogue fuzzball Rocket Raccoon, product of a nefarious genetic tinkerer’s god delusions (a strong performance from Chukwudi Iwuji), and the other his friends’ efforts to save his life. Vol. 3 didn’t entirely hang together, with too many scenes that were just make-work to provide requisite action, and a segue into an endlessly promising satiric idea – an alternate Earth populated with mutated anthropomorphic animals forced to lead prosaic suburban lives – dropped as soon as it was introduced. But Gunn achieved a new pitch of emotional urgency, giving genuine shading and gravitas to the previously smarmy and feigned-feeling earnestness of his material, precisely by digging more boldly into his darker, less homiletic streak, skirting genuinely ugly images and dark fates before arriving at a point of festive revelry.\n\nPeyton Reed’s third trip to his appointed wing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was met by contrast with general disdain and disinterest. Ant-Man’s special appeal once lay in the fact his zone of the MCU was the most modest in scale, with the everyman hero and his down-to-earth concerns, constantly toggling between literal and metaphorical insignificance. But Quantumania instead pushed its heroes into a microscopic fantasy world ruled over by the nefarious multiverse tyrant Kang the Conqueror, essentially remaking Thor: Ragnarok (2017) only with Jeff Goldblum swapped out for Bill Murray for the zany mid-movie cameo. Quantumania wasn’t quite as bad as it was painted by many, with Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton providing fine additions as the long-lost and fresh-minted new guard of the heroic team, and whilst his off-screen behaviour drained the potential fun from Jonathan Majors’ performance as Kang, he did well in providing a more Machiavellian and coldly manipulative type of major franchise villain. But the movie also never added up to anything, pacing through a very basic variation on the familiar type of story where some strangers arrive in a strange land and lead a rebellion against the evil ruler, but detached from any urgent emotional imperative. The evident intention to set up Kang as a terrifyingly omnipotent antagonist was undercut by the more immediate need to have him neatly defeated, at least in one iteration, by this entry’s end.\n\nNia DaCosta, who emerged from indieville with the strong debut Little Woods, was fated to be the lucky gal left holding the superhero movie bag when The Marvels saw release late in the year only to prove the first truly bruising MCU bomb. The reasons for that failure were many, not least of which that it was a tripartite sequel to not just 2019’s Captain Marvel, with Brie Larson returning as the intergalactic swashbuckler Carol Danvers, but also to two different TV shows with wildly varying viewing figures, as Carol was joined by two more superheroines, Teyonah Parris’s Monica Rambeaux and Iman Vellani’s Kamala ‘Ms. Marvel’ Khan. The trio was forced to battle a wrathful emissary of the alien Kree race after Carol inadvertently wrecked their society, and found themselves entangled through the incredible power of plot contrivance, randomly swapping locations and powers. The Marvels was at once a symptom and a victim of a franchise grown confused in its running story contexts and tepid in aesthetics, aiming for a straightforward and zesty girl power romp but insisting on blurring the matter with sidelong lurches into musical comedy and slapstick brand self-satire to the extent that the film threatened to feel like something cobbled together purely to fill a release date. The funny thing was, though, this was still quite enjoyable, at least until its last act fell in a heap: the three leads bounced off each-other well, and DaCosta invested it all with some colour and pizzazz, whilst Zawe Ashton’s villain was cool if rather wasted.\n\nDespite the convulsions gripping the MCU brand it still seemed in roaring good health compared to the DC strand over at Warner Bros., where the attempt to dispel creative rictus by dumping most of the franchise as it stood resulted in both fans and casual viewers dropping any pretence of caring about the last few sorry entries to be released. David F. Sandberg’s Shazam! Fury of the Gods suffered from a similar collision between its own, modestly enjoyable achievement and the swiftly wilting cultural context for it to Quantumania. Sandberg’s sequel to his 2019 success saw his band of scrappy juvenile orphans turned perturbingly fit superheroes this time pitched against a trio of female gods, out to avenge themselves for having their powers stolen by Djimon Hounsou’s wizard. Fury of the Gods wielded a similarly unsettled mix of impulses to the first film, blending a bouncy, warm-hearted vibe channelling classic Saturday morning cartoons with the edgier, more violent and sardonic edge of ‘80s blockbusters for big kids, and a visual palette that toggled between flashes of loving texture and mystique in some of its fantasy realms, and a staggeringly bland depiction of contemporary Philadelphia, invaded by equally bland CGI manifestations of mythical beings. It didn’t help proceedings that Zachary Levi’s main protagonist was here by far the least interesting of the coterie of heroes. On the plus side, Helen Mirren seemed to be having some genuine fun as the more noble but waning elder of the offended gods; on the other, Lucy Liu walked through her part as the most villainous with a notable aura of contempt.\n\nAndy Muschietti’s The Flash more completely revealed the total creative confusion of the brand whilst also sweeping it all towards the trash pile, offering a movie that was plainly the result of endless boardroom second guessing and opportunism. The Flash saw Barry Allen stranding himself in an alternate timeline after trying to use his reality-distorting gifts to rewrite history and save his mother from being murdered. Barry was eventually forced into alliance with a brutalised Supergirl and an aging Batman –Michael Keaton model – to try and fend off General Zod’s invasion of Earth. The idea of building an entire movie around Ezra Miller’s talkative dork hero because he was the one thing a lot of people liked about the first cut of Justice League was ill-advised enough, and Muschietti’s film went through the prescribed motions of providing a more playful and zany wing of the DC style after the gothic heaviosity of the earlier entries, before reportedly endless reshoots also force it to capitalise on trendy nostalgia and multiverse-enabled franchise panoplies. The Flash proved painfully devoted to giving Miller space to be extremely unfunny and tiresome in dual characterisations, and whilst it trucked in Keaton’s Batman, the movie then gave him practically nothing to do beyond listlessly recite some hallowed dialogue. Similarly, Sasha Calle as Supergirl made immediate, intriguing impact even as she was given a total of about ten lines and repeatedly killed off, in order to summarise how paltry the DC imprimatur is without Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\nAngel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle proved another nail in the superhero coffin. Xolo Maridueña was Jaime Reyes, the talented son of some hard-working Mexican immigrants living in Miami, who, struggling to find work after graduating from pre-law, finds himself through various contrivances trapped in a symbiotic relationship with a piece of alien hardware that transforms him into a flashy bionic warrior. This sets him on a collision cause with the notorious arms-manufacturing Kord clan, with both the fearsome, fascistic matriarch (Susan Sarandon) and her more conscientious niece (Bruna Marquezine) proving desirous of his anatomy, if different parts of it. Blue Beetle proved a self-conscious attempt to marry the most basic blueprint of the superhero mystique, with lashings of comic relief and a straightforward zero-to-hero arc, with a Latin American equivalent of Black Panther. In practice this meant a script packed full of dialogue so inane it might as well have been written with AI software (I lost count of the times someone said, “Let’s do this!” with gritty resolve), sitting cheek-by-jowl with references to serious history couched in the goofiest manner possible, like the Reyes clan’s ex-revolutionary grandma wielding a laser minigun. As a whole the film proved something truly fascinating, if only on one specific level, as an artefact made entirely in accordance to the precepts of progressive political consensus of recent years, and yet which finished up portraying its plucky heroes in the most broadly garish and stereotyped of terms, and tried to say something meaningful about the uneasy historical and unequal relationships of the various Americas in a manner both cringe-worthy and trivialising. The film did improve as it went on and embraced its own ridiculousness, but any pity I felt for the makers in their earnest attempts to turn a back-burner property into something distinctive was nullified by the stupefying banality of the result.\n\nThe Creator saw Gareth Edwards, with a couple of big franchise successes under his belt, skewing back to the template of his debut Monsters in applying genre metaphors and imagery to a story that yearned to address burning real-world issues, whilst also trying to fly the flag for adventurous, original sci-fi filmmaking. The setting was a near future in which a bellicose USA has declared war on robots and Artificial Intelligences after one was blamed for a nuclear explosion that decimated Los Angeles; the only refuge AIs have is the conglomerate nation of ‘New Asia’. John David Washington played the American agent who fell in love with a pro-AI New Asian woman (Gemma Chan) who then died in an ill-timed raid, and after a breakdown is called upon to track down a new AI superweapon. This proves to be a childlike android with the power to control all electrical devices. The Creator certainly looked good and hit the ground running, executed on a scale made to seem bigger than the relatively modest budget suggested, thanks to Edwards’ technical expertise, with dramatic and visual textures gleaned from a variety of post-cyberpunk sci-fi writing and illustrations. But the film was an aggravatingly simplistic poster child for the problems of trying to sell thinly veiled political metaphors through borrowed genre trappings, as Edwards went about it in a manner that made James Cameron’s Avatar movies, which he was clearly emulating, and their parables look like Jonathan Swift. Edwards’ efforts to explore Vietnam and War on Terror parallels came on with scarcely any attempt at genuine, clever defamiliarisation or complication, instead utilising the laziest and most familiar genre tropes, particularly the messianic child magician, in what almost threatened to become a sci-fi-daubed remake of the Eddie Murphy vehicle The Golden Child, whilst the militarist baddies were so caricatured they might as well have stumbled out of a Yippie street theatre skit.\n\nSpeaking of sci-fi dystopias with excruciatingly shallow politics, Francis Lawrence revived The Hunger Games franchise with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, an adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ prequel novel about the early days of that beloved series character, the future dictator Coriolanus Snow, and his particular role in transforming the eponymous death match from an exercise in fascist intimidation into a media event. Tom Blyth was cast as Snow, and he was indeed an apt youthful avatar for Donald Sutherland: as per Fellini, he had the eyes of a masturbator down pat. Snow, we learned, came from a once-mighty patrician family fallen on hard times, fending off disdainful peers and elders, who decides to go all in when he’s required to mentor a Hunger Games tribute, fiery protest singer Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler), when he realises she has little fighting talent but much star potential. This entry worked out better for Lawrence than going back to J.K. Rowling material did for David Yates, at least for the moment, but as a movie it was a jarringly uneven beast, alternating the compelling and the bottomlessly stupid. On the one hand, it had a surprisingly long, involved story we knew was not likely to have the cheeriest ending, and got down and dirty in portraying the Hunger Games themselves with a lot more pitchfork murders than apparently we could stand ten years ago. Peter Dinklage brought gravitas and cunning to playing Snow’s academic hater. The relatively gritty and substantial aspects sat cheek by jowl with flourishes of bewildering camp, like Viola Davis’ over-the-top performance as the wicked witch of the Hunger Games, and Zegler wrestling with a part impossible to make believable as a righteous folkie who can belt out a compelling blues a capella whilst an ocean of snakes slithers her way.\n\nMichael B. Jordan chose to take on the mantle of star-turned-director in living up to the legacy of the seemingly imperishable Rocky-Creed franchise, helming Creed III. This entry saw Jordan’s hero Donnie Creed facing up to a troubling blast from his formerly edgy past. Dame Anderson (Jonathan Majors), an old pal from the orphanage and a former boxer of great promise himself but jailed for a long stint over an incident with a gun, came back into his life and manipulated him into giving him a shot in the ring, only for Donnie to find his former friend bent on vengeance and displacing him from his too-comfortable niche in life. Creed III had some problems, most particularly a storyline that didn’t bear much scrutiny in its mechanics, and it faced a similar problem to the later Rocky sequels in how to believably justify the sight of a successful fighter with a stable home life driven to engage in do-or-die grudge matches. Jordan nonetheless tried to more subtly take on that problem, with Dame embodying the darker side of Donnie’s schismatic personality, and displayed some genuine talent behind the camera as he worked to illustrate the psychology of his characters. Jordan also aimed to take seriously and wring dramatic traction from what was previously Donnie’s rather confused, box-ticking background as a character, locating a simmering angst and semi-buried rage still lurking in his makeup even as his old comrade tries to emasculate him. Jordan coaxed strong performances from himself and his cast.\n\nSteven Soderbergh and Channing Tatum revived their own popular, physically prodigious hero, albeit one who’s also most assuredly the proverbial lover-not-a-fighter, for Magic Mike’s Last Dance. This time around Mike, pushing forty with his furniture store kaput thanks to the pandemic, stumbled into a second act in life when he encountered Salma Hayek’s Max, a woman recently separated from her unfaithful plutocrat husband and determined to use the fortune still at her command to meet her own needs: mesmerised by Mike’s preternatural dance talents and dedication to his female audience, she pushes him into staging and choreographing a revue in London. Third time around wasn’t quite a charm for the swashbuckling stripper, as the central romance between Mike and his florid but insecure benefactress never became convincing: Max was a rather grating, borderline thuggish character despite her nominally sympathetic motives, and the script instead took refuge in sitcom clichés, like a witty butler. Soderbergh’s tenor of antsy realism couldn’t tap into the same vein of gossamer showmanship so many people appreciated in the second film. And whilst the script took some potentially interesting pot-shots at the industry of backward-looking art about female suffering and proposed instead to celebrate gleeful modern sensualism, it did so in a pretty shallow fashion. Still, the dance numbers were tremendous, and well worth sitting through the rest for.\n\nKelly Fremon Craig took on Judy Blume’s beloved warhorse Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret, retaining the novel’s early 1970s setting whilst delving into the timeless problems Blume explored through the adventures of the eponymous heroine, who faces changes to her reality exterior and interior, including moving to the suburbs, making new friends, feeling the urge to charge towards the supposed delights of adulthood, and negotiating the complexities of her family identity, particularly the matter of her faith. Abby Rider Fortson was ideal in the lead, never seeming precocious or blankly generic, and was surrounded by an excellent cast, including Rachel McAdams as her sympathetic mom contending with her own life pivot, and Kathy Bates as her brash but loving grandmother. Craig’s wisest touch was keeping the story in period, although this choice also highlighted something a little depressing about current cultural mores, or at least how movies usually tackle them: the ‘70s setting allowed Craig to avoid any urges to a more rhetorically modern take on Margaret’s experiences – no social media talking points and buzzwords flung in – instead giving it all the breathing room to simply, if wryly and with keen feeling, observe these rites of passage for the heroine, from frantic bust-building exercises to helping a friend weather the shock of her having her first period in a mortifying time and place. The insistence on Margaret’s agency when it came to those fateful choices of identity still retained some of the transgressive spark that long made Blume a target of conservative ire. The film had enormous charm and no small amount of humour, although the story was a bit sparse and episodic, perhaps in part from being forced to move away from the mediating perspective of the book, despite retaining Margaret’s narration. The insistence on good vibes all ‘round meant that it never quite grappled with the most chaotic and fervent impulses of that age either.\n\nWes Anderson’s Asteroid City enlarged on hints in his recent movies that he’s trying to flesh out both his meta impulses and the undercurrent of melancholia that’s been registering more and more strongly. This time Anderson again delivered his trove of retro references and stylised gestures through a story-within-a-story conceit: the main narrative of the film, from which sprang the title, is a play, interspersed with a quasi-documentary presentation mimicking a 1950s TV style. Whilst the presentation recounts stories involving the artists and actors involved in writing and staging the now-legendary play, all filmed in black and white, the actual play, a mishmash of a pastiche of classic American theatre and a ‘50s sci-fi flick, unfolds in full colour. Asteroid City was a particularly agonising example of Anderson’s sensibility, affecting to self-critique his efforts to quell and contain overt emotion within the customary friezes of his visual and dramatic style, whilst also pushing that style right to breaking point, strangling both his humour and sigils of human feeling before anything could fully bloom. The usual amazing assembly of actors flitted by, even as most were required to give the same performance: Scarlett Johansson emerged as the most valuable, deftly inhabiting the space she was given to inhabit as a defensive movie star. One moment, when the cast suddenly burst out into a defiant, ritual chant, wielded an inchoate power that nonetheless had nothing to do with the rest of the film, save perhaps in offering a credo for Anderson’s resistance to reality.\n\nSimilarly unfolding largely in a deliberately artificial realm touched with aspects of nostalgia and stylised emotion was Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, the year’s financial champion. Margot Robbie headlined as the “stereotypical” Barbie, living out a joyous life in a realm filled with other variant Barbies and the ranks of Kens who persist as perpetually frustrated subalterns, as sustained in the collective imagination of the world. Barbie soon started falling prey to negative emotions projected on her from the real world and set out to put things right, only for her particular faithful Ken (Ryan Gosling) to get a load of patriarchy after travelling into reality with her, and, thrilled, imposing it on Barbieland. Gerwig and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach’s efforts to offer commentary on contemporary gender relations and the disparity between childhood idealisation and adult wisdom signalled an ambition beyond simply making a feature-length toy commercial, and it’s hard to argue with the way Barbie certainly hit a bullseye with a long-neglected and frustrated sector of the audience. The degree to whether the film actually found any substance in its quasi-satirical attitude, or merely shoved tropes and memes around like a game of curling, was nonetheless debatable. The film had a truly, peculiarly ambivalent attitude towards its supposed icon of female identity and stuck Robbie with a thankless role, whilst most of the actual entertainment value was supplied by Gosling as a Ken who invests everything from surfing to upholding gendered dictatorship with an attitude of boyish enthusiasm, and his fellows Kens in their ridiculous civil war.\n\nBarbie’s biggest rival at the box office for the year was the animated film The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a work just as sweetly tailored to a millennial viewer as Barbie was to its audience. Like that film too, it was an arch exercise in trying to transform a non-narrative intellectual property into something that could sustain audience interest, and did so in similar ways, if not in ultimate tone and pretences. But it was also one that remembered to work coherently for a younger audience indifferent to all that grown-up guff. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, tasked with banishing the memory of the infamous 1993 take on the material, were puckish in trying to contour the adventures of Mario and Luigi Luigi into something resembling a coherent story. The title duo, hapless Brooklyn plumbers whose Italian accents we learn early on are faked for the sake of branding their faltering business, were accidentally transported to a magical universe where they find themselves in the middle of a battle for control between the forces of the nefarious saurian Bowser and the kingdom of foundling-turned-ruler Princess Peach. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was only intermittently clever, as in an early scene the saw Mario bouncing around impediments on a city street in charming recreation of the original game layout, and mixture of sardonic humour and hero’s journey was pretty standard for the day and age. The animation was slick and so colourful it could find a second life of popularity amongst the edibles-popping crowd, well-matched to a movie that stuck tongue so deep in cheek it came out the other side, as Donkey Kong was roped into the action and everyone went tearing about in go-karts for some reason, with Chris Pratt serviceably voicing Mario and Anya Taylor-Joy having fun as the spunky Peach.\n\nEmma Seligman’s Bottoms managed to be both the indieville companion piece to Barbie and its would-be crazy-and-locked-in-the-attic sibling, in playing fast and loose with movie tropes and feminist preoccupations. For her sophomore outing after her marvellous Shiva Baby, Seligman took a hard swerve towards would-be popular fare, tackling the hallowed horny, anarchic high schooler movie. The official new twist was in focusing on two motor-mouthed, try-hard, dipshit queer girls attending a high school whose football matches are genuinely deadly events and where the official jock heroes are shrieking, fragile nitwits. Through a series of absurd events, the girls see a path to getting the nookie they crave by starting up a fight club…err, self-defence class that flings them into the company of variously hot and oddball schoolmates, and where the pleasures of girl-on-girl contact toggle between the sensual and the blood-soaked. Bottoms was fairly bold on a conceptual level, wanting to channel films like If… and Heathers, but really played as a ruder, cruder, more aggressively hip take on Booksmart, with gags aplenty taking aim at just about every conceivable target, but too often mistaking its pseudo-naughtiness for real transgression when, if all was boiled down, it was actually a pretty stock-standard girl power-themed movie, with the jokes tripping over each-other through the lack of a clearly sustained rhythm. The film’s core idea of seeing two self-centred and obnoxious heroines stumbling towards accidental heroism was a good one, but also one it couldn’t really stick to: the individual character stories floundered, and yet lessons were learned and eventually girl power celebrated, if in a deliberately ridiculous and ironic fashion, in a death-match confrontation with a rival school’s footballers. The ingenious observational and character humour that made Shiva Baby so eye-catching were nowhere to be found.\n\nEmerald Fennell made her sophomore foray, following the talking point bullseye of Promising Young Woman, with Saltburn, a film that resembled, as many noted, a cross between Brideshead Revisited and The Talented Mr. Ripley, with a little Teorema thrown in too. Barry Keoghan put his limpid blue glare and mistreated puppy dog face to expert use playing Oliver Quick, a seemingly pathetic freshman at Oxford who falls in with glamorous rich kid Felix (Jacob Elordi), and when invited to spend the summer at his family’s estate, begins to reveal a slippery talent for manipulation, seducing several members of the family – a clan that included Richard E. Grant and Rosamund Pike as the parents. Fennell’s authentic-feeling eye for the world of the British upper crust registered in the occasional jot of waspish humour and vignettes like a toff bawling out a rap song on a karaoke night, as well as packing in some nostalgic touchstones for the early 2000s, and giving Carey Mulligan an amusing cameo as a batty family friend. What began as a tale of class tension and yearning, mixed with intimations of deeply fetishised male sexuality, offered episodes trying oh so hard to be edgy, like Oliver lapping up menstrual blood and semen-infused bathwater and attempting to stick his dick in a grave. The problem with such provocations was that they were ultimately revealed to be gestures without any underlying substance. Oliver’s supposed passions were ultimately revealed to be a smokescreen and indeed such indulgences risked his overall project, as he was revealed to be just your average 19-year-old preternaturally talented fraudster-fetishist-seducer-murderer. Fennell failed to sustain any kind of psychological depth and extended her penchant for silly story twists, meaning the film ultimately proved to merely expound, despite the superficial satire, on an old, old topic: the upper class’s fear of having its stuff taken by people taking advantage of them. Saltburn at least looked good, and Fennell might make a filmmaker when she gets over herself.\n\nGene Stupnitsky’s No Hard Feelings wanted to revive the art of the edgy, smutty comedy and provide a vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence, renewing her attempts to present herself as a full-grown and gutsy lead. Lawrence played a 30-something woman who, faced with mounting money worries, takes on an offer made by two over-involved parents who want someone to seduce their terminally shy, barely-legal son before he goes off to college, in exchange for a new car. She finds her tense and gawky young target initially impossible to bed, but soon strikes up an evolving friendship that sees both of them alternately mortified and liberated by the results. The film had some fat satirical targets in mind, most particularly the distance between the not-that-much-older Gen Y, already resigned to perpetually treading water, and a parentally coddled and digitally infantilised teen cohort, but you knew sooner or later the film would insist it had heart too. Lawrence gave the part her all, displaying great chops for physical comedy, and Stupnitsky delivered one properly risqué and inspired comic setpiece when a stark-naked Lawrence got into a brawl with some obnoxious teens on a beach, set to Hall and Oates’ “Maneater.” But too often otherwise it was a movie that mistook various kinds of agony for humour, with a constant emphasis on humiliation, and the direction never felt properly attuned to the humour, particularly in comparison to the thematically similar Licorice Pizza.\n\nSimilar in focus on a life-battered young woman if very different in tone, A Good Person was written and directed by Zach Braff as a vehicle carefully tailored to his brief girlfriend Florence Pugh’s talents, and he succeeded to a surprising degree. Pugh played a pharmaceutical saleswoman with musical ability whose seemingly happy life is destroyed when she causes a car crash that kills members of her fiancé’s family. As, a year or so down the track, she begins an agonising crawl out of a gutter of festering guilt and painkiller addiction, she finds a sponsor in her now ex-partner’s grandfather (Morgan Freeman), who himself has a bitter history of substance abuse and sees helping her as the ultimate challenge in his search for redemption. Braff’s patented approach to filmmaking was in evidence, with plenty of soulful ditties on the soundtrack and calculated oscillations between high drama and wry comedy. Braff also proposed to make a deeply ironic point about the heroine’s pivot from hawking drugs to trying to blackmail old colleagues for some of them, although this edge of social commentary was dropped in favour of following a basic indie film template in which a disparate band of shambolic characters stumble together through their healing process. But A Good Person also played some interesting games with that template, with a heroine whose flashes of ugly behaviour and pathetic streak weren’t skirted, and a climactic confrontation, in which the accord of mutual aid and forgiveness broke down, that proved properly gruelling. The last act rambled on somewhat, fumbling for the right cathartic note to strike, as Braff set out to depict the main character’s evolution into an artist, but again I gave him points for not trying to wrap everything up in a neat bundle. In some way Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up played as the next step in the story.\n\nWim Wenders’ Perfect Days had the great Koji Yakusho playing Hirayama, a middle-aged man who has immersed himself in a simple, rhythmic existence, cleaning Tokyo’s toilets by day and enjoying simpler life pleasures the rest of the time, like reading a good book, listening to a beloved album, and eating and drinking in familiar haunts around town. He’s so blithely self-sufficient and wilfully behind the times he ironically finds himself coming round to cool again as the cassettes he still listens to attract hipster interest. On the way he interacts with people whose lives intersect with his, like his gawky young workmate and his cool but confused girlfriend, his teen niece who turns up seeking respite from her prosperous but demanding mother, and the dying ex-husband of a woman who runs a bar he frequents. Perfect Days saw Wenders claiming a new shore both in locale and creativity (reminiscent of the way Abbas Kiarostami also found an ideal stage for later career wanders in Japan), with the setting and with his usually dense narratives and aesthetic stripped down to the living stem. Whilst Hirayama resembled one of Wender’s familiar exiles-in-society protagonists, this one was happy in that role. Perhaps the film that resulted was a little too sentimentally perfect, with the forces that drove him to choose such a life described only as the faintest hints – Hirayama’s general avoidance of alcohol, mention of a father whose behaviour seems to have permanently alienated his son – left too minimal to make Hirayama seem much more than an emblem of Wenders’ idyll, for all of Yakusho’s fine-grained acting. The film had a remarkable effect all the same, making his analogue lifestyle and randomly invested sense of purpose uniquely appealing.\n\nWhilst I admired Yorgos Lanthimos’ first two films, I was fatally turned off his work when he went English-language, but I forced myself to watch his latest, Poor Things, because of the unadulterated raves it received. Essentially the arthouse provocateur version of Barbie, Poor Things, loosely adapted from a novel by Scots writer Alisdair Gray, aimed to present a self-consciously feminist twist on Frankenstein, with Willem Dafoe playing Dr Godwin Baxter (who, in an indication of the film’s subtlety, is known to all and sundry as God, and has a scarred face, because he’s the real monster, y’all). Baxter forces one of his medical students into complicity in his latest, boldest experiment, having taken the body of a woman who committed suicide and implanted the brain of her own unborn child in her head prior to bringing her back to life, and is rearing the bizarre progeny that resulted – Bella (Emma Stone), a child in a full grown woman’s body, who acts as bratty as expected at first but starts to rapidly mature. Once she discovers the delights of sex, Bella runs off with God’s lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), a rakish hunk of puff pastry, as the start of a Candide-like odyssey through the highs and lows of human experience. Lanthimos framed all of this by setting it in a deliberately unreal, ahistorical, steampunk zone. This immediately undercut all pretences to commenting coherently on social history, and the main function of this choice was to let Lanthimos drop in anachronistic swearing when he felt like it, in a movie filmed in a manner that looked like a succession of recreated 1990s and 2000s alternative rock album covers. Lanthimos managed to rip off the fascination evinced in his early work and Greek generational fellow Athina Rachel Tsangari with herky-jerky physicality and distorted, alienated worldviews, whilst proffering a movie that recalled Rolf de Heer’s Bad Boy Bubby but without its punky rawness or actual, strange love of humanity. Of all the films of year Poor Things probably irritated me the most, with its grindingly obvious and perfectly smug take on Bella’s journey, as well as its hollow provocations that revealed Lanthimos, for all his posturing about the weirdness of society, has no real sympathy for anyone, and the film as a whole was one of many this year that played at being provocative but delivered a message that was actually, highly reassuring for current hipster mores.\n\nSpeaking of arthouse provocateurs, Brandon Cronenberg resurged with his second feature, Infinity Pool. Alexander Skarsgard played a blocked writer who’s retreated with his wife to a swank resort in a small, imaginary country in search of inspiration, and after accidentally running over a local during a boozy night out with fellow guests and being arrested for the deed, learns about the unique local mode of justice the hard way: he’s told he can pay for an exact double of himself to be created and executed in his place. Perversely elated by the spectacle, he’s drawn into a clique of fellow tourists who have experienced the same ordeal and become addicted to dangerous and heady acts. Like its precursor Possessor, Infinity Pool had an interesting, Philip K. Dick-like story hook that Cronenberg fils buried under an unending pile of stylistic and gestural clichés for this mode of filmmaking, from the gnarled masks that represent the savagery of man to the extended trippy orgy sequence, and the usual, grimly droning music that kicked in so early in the affair I started to wonder if this was going to be a send-up of the style. Infinity Pool was slightly better than Possessor all told, as the absurd hyperbole of the castration fantasy hinted at some personal investment for Cronenberg if one read the protagonist’s anxiety over being identified as the son-in-law of a famous publisher for his own nepo baby status, and the extremely committed performances, including from Mia Goth as usual, gave it some real juice at points. But it still dissolved into an absurd stew where the excess of gore and sickness produced merely impatience rather than enthralled admiration for the daring, all wrapped up in what was at least a well-shot bundle.\n\nIt’s rather odd that it took over a decade for the examples of The Social Network and The Wolf of Wall Street to crystallise into a run of movies concentrating on the little legends of big business, but 2023 saw a small glut of such progeny. Jon S. Baird’s Tetris explored an ultimately triumphant story that was also timely in the way it traced current tech, gaming, and political paradigms back to the waning days of the Cold War. Tetris portrayed a young American go-getter trying to make contact with the Russian inventor of the eponymous, insanely addictive, ever-so-simply-elegant video game, but finding them both up against the glowering cyclopean buttresses of the collapsing Soviet Union’s endemic paranoia and corruption. The film wasn’t nearly as ambitious as its Yank protagonist, with rather stock illustrations of his brash life-loving energy crashing against Russian dourness and cynicism including a scene where he encourages his new friend to dance to ‘80s synth-pop, and a major subplot involving a two-faced interpreter turned rather suddenly into a feminist twist. But it was spritely, well-told, and had some cinematic wit as the eruption of action saw cinematic and digital textures starting to commingle.\n\nBen Affleck offered his own variation on this theme with Air: Affleck cast old buddy and collaborator Matt Damon as a Nike marketing executive, who pursues a risky and anomalous strategy to lure the young about-to-be-superstar of basketball Michael Jordan to sign a sponsorship deal with the rising but cash-strapped footwear company, with the concept of personalised and personally branded shoes. Affleck’s take on the story, which came with the promise of a built-in happy ending, had nonetheless a dimension of implicit meaning and sullen warning, as a parable for current Hollywood’s atrophied taste for risks, with Damon’s saggy, tired hero trying to recapture some feeling of the passion that defined the company’s early days as the only way to truly lay claim to the future. Affleck gave himself a scene-stealing role as the Zen-quoting head honcho torn between piecemeal defence of what he’s built and bolder grabs for glory. Air was a slick, entertaining movie, one that managed to hold the attention despite mostly being a bunch of conversations in a corporate office block. At the same time, Affleck’s approach also often threatened to turn it into an extended video for the array of super ‘80s hits on the soundtrack with narrative attached, and the whole thing reeked just a little of carefully lawyered-up ass-kissing. Jordan was portrayed in a manner uncomfortably reminiscent of Jesus in Ben-Hur as the towering, faceless emblem of several intersecting lines of officially anointed heroism in American culture.\n\nMatt Johnson’s BlackBerry presented the slouchy Canadian riposte to Tetris and Air’s brand of U!S!A! triumphalism, an antithetical portrait of men bound to go from losers to winners and back to losers. Johnson explored the twists of fortune that saw two socially inept but brilliant techies with a world-changing idea throw in their lot with high-powered businessman Jim Balsillie and become enormously successful, only to then be defeated both by wily rivals and their own hubris. Johnson, who also played the more idealistically nerdy of the two inventors, got good performances from Jay Baruchel as his former boy wonder colleague and particularly Glenn Howerton as Balsillie, whose ferocity is impressive until it suddenly isn’t. The story was certainly compelling even if Johnson’s direction was basic in its light veneer of handheld realism. His reflexes as a former comedian were apparent in his delight in the stark contrast of creative enthusiasm and geek unworldliness versus corporate thug culture, and what happens when the former are seduced as well as cowered by the latter, even if its take on that contrast was rather old-hat. I kept getting the feeling the film should either have chosen more properly to be a serious analysis of this world or become the satire Johnson’s reflexes felt more attuned to, so the characters never really progressed beyond types. Most enjoyably, Johnson scattered the cast with some heroes of Canadian film and TV, like Michael Ironside.\n\nOliver Parker’s The Great Escaper depicted a different kind of true story, harking back to the tale of Bernie Jordan, a near-nonagenerian World War II veteran who made his way alone to attend the 70th annive"
