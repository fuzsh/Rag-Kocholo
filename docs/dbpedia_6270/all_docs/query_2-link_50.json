        "text": "Written for Screen Arts & Culture 355: American Television History (November 2013)\n\nBrief: In this class, we were tasked with comparing shows from before 1970 and after 1970 and how their cultural contexts and production methods were similar and different. I used two of my favorite cartoons in Rocky & Bullwinkle and Family Guy. I discovered the shows have far more in common than I knew prior to writing.\n\nJay Ward’s Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends was and still remains as one of the greatest cartoons in television history. The sharp, satirical comedy provided entertainment for children as well as witty, highbrow humor for adults. The show is now a pop-culture staple in the fifty years since its cancellation. One program that debuted forty years later and mirrors Ward’s creation is Seth MacFarlane’s Family Guy. From its start as a ridiculous comedy on Fox in 1999 to becoming one of the biggest cultural phenomenons of the early 2000’s, both programs are similar in their styles of humor and punch line delivery. These shows were created within very different cultural contexts, and comedy shifted massively during this forty-year period, but it was the comedy and elements of Rocky & Bullwinkle that paved the way for programs like Family Guy to exist and succeed.\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle debuted on ABC on November 19, 1959 under sponsorship from General Mills. Using American Bandstand at 5:00 PM as a lead-in program, ABC was able to cultivate a strong viewership of children and it quickly became the highest rated daytime TV program (Scott, 24). General Mills specified they wanted a late-afternoon, pre-dinner time slot to get as many children as possible for their viewership (Cawley and Korkis). In an era where sponsorship was often pivotal to program survival, General Mills did have their say in content, For example, one episode focused on a worldwide shortage of cereal box tops, which was causing the economy to crash (Ward, Box Top). Box Tops are an invention of General Mills. The program really took off and Ward was given more creative freedom when the show shifted from ABC to NBC and from daytime into primetime. Jay Ward and his fellow writers Chris Hayward and Allan Burns decided to make the show a bit edgier than it had been (Bill Scott). The ratings unfortunately suffered from stiff competition by moving to Sunday nights at 7:00 PM, and the program met an untimely cancellation in 1964, but it lived on in syndication on a regular basis until 1982 (Cawley and Korkis).\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle debuted in an era of uncertainty for America, the Cold War had just begun, the civil rights movement was starting, and the hippie generation would soon arrive. Rocky & Bullwinkle riffed on many of the fears of the era, most notably; the characters of Boris Badenov, Natasha Fatale and Fearless Leader from the nation of Pottsylvania were allegorical devices for cold war fears. (Knapp) However, Rocky and Bullwinkle almost always foiled the bad guys. They played unlikely heroes that represented all things good, Dyess-Nugent writes “Against the Cold War backdrop of the last years of the Eisenhower administration and the New Frontier of the Kennedy era, Moose and Squirrel were forever being rousted from their snug home in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, to save Western civilization from some encroaching menace“ (Dyess-Nugent). Rocky & Bullwinkle may not go down as one of the most important shows of all time, but it certainly was a welcome, new style of comedy that involved pop-culture and a sense of adventure. It touched on the cold war uncertainty surrounding the nation and used comedy to diffuse the tension surrounding activities in the outside world.\n\nNearly forty years after Rocky & Bullwinkle debuted on ABC, Fox, who had been churning out edgy programming for most of their first decade on air, decided to bring a new companion cartoon, which would be something different from The Simpsons, or King of The Hill. After failure with his previous pilots, creator Seth MacFarlane pitched a comedy about a dysfunctional working class family from Rhode Island, The Griffins, who often had trouble befall them and went to unusual lengths to put things back to normal. It debuted after Super Bowl XXXIII on Fox, creating a strong lead-in audience of twenty two million viewers (Levin). Most thought the program was hilarious, but it also immediately generated controversy, Levin wrote “In the pilot episode, Stewie, a talking toddler with a clipped British accent, was openly contemptuous of his loutish dad and bent on killing his sweet-natured mother in a quest for world domination” (Levin). This was just the beginning of what would be a successful but contemptuous first run of episodes for the Griffin family. After an initial cancellation in 2002, fan demand and syndication brought the program back to the air in 2005.and it continues to air today. It has taken Seth MacFarlane from an animator in college to owning a two billion dollar empire that has been nominated for many Emmy’s and is the highest rated show ever in the male 18-34 demographic (Dean). When Family Guy debuted, America was in the midst of Y2K paranoia, a strong economy under Bill Clinton, and a new millennium on the horizon. Before the show ended its first run, George Bush had been elected, the September 11th attacks happened and the fear of terrorism took over the nation. Family Guy did not ignore these things, but chose to use humor to make fun of the situations and bring a lighthearted tone, similar to what Jay Ward tried to do with Rocky & Bullwinkle during the Cold War era. The show is heavily influenced by pop-culture and current events. Even through the newest episodes, nothing is off limits for MacFarlane and his team of writers, they do not fear offending any specific groups in terms of inappropriate content, as only one episode of the show has not aired on network television because the topic of the episode was abortion (Mitchell). The show is this generation’s definition of dark comedy and surrealist humor.\n\nOne primary example comes from a 2011 episode surrounding time travel and preventing the 9/11 attacks. In the episode “Back To The Pilot,” Brian and Stewie use a time machine to go back and stop the 9/11 attacks, but in a twist of events, it causes the second Civil War and a nuclear holocaust, so the characters go back and reverse their actions and high-five when the Twin Towers fall (MacFarlane, Back). This caused an outrage from viewership, but MacFarlane explained that much of the show’s 9/11 based humor is because he was supposed to be on one of the doomed planes flying out of Boston, but he was too hung over and missed his flight (Daily Mail Reporter). MacFarlane went on to explain ‘”The only reason it hasn’t really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn’t really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment” (Daily Mail Reporter). As a comedy writer of a very non-politically correct program, MacFarlane has made the conscious decision to utilize 9/11 humor, perhaps as a way to remind himself that it could have been him that perished in the attacks.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, both programs aired forty years apart but they share remarkably similar production qualities. Rocky & Bullwinkle used simple animations and relied more on plot and voice acting to make the show great. Through the writing of Ward, Hayward and Burns, along with the spectacular voice talents of Bill Scott, June Foray and Paul Frees, this sextuplet was able to make a clever, culturally influential program that still has staying power. Most notably, no animators were hired for the show initially, and instead the animation was outsourced to a company in Mexico. General Mills found this to be financially attractive as the sponsor, but it led to many errors that were not caught until the program aired (Bill Scott). In hindsight, it does add to some of the classic, low-budget charm of the program and reminds viewers of a simpler era. Family Guy uses some of those same production elements fifty years later. Until utilizing CGI beginning in 2005 and being broadcast in high definition in 2009, (Macfarlane, Brian), Family Guy used simple animations that involved stock shots and only the characters facial features moving, similar to Rocky & Bullwinkle. Family Guy also uses multitalented voice actors to assist in the show’s comedy. Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry and Alex Borstein all voice multiple characters on the program, something that the show has pointed out within the show at times. The minor characters of Carter Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartmann have similar voices and the episode self-reflexively pointed that out (McFarlane, Believe).\n\nA key difference between both shows is the idea of serialization and self-containment. Rocky & Bullwinkle was serialized throughout its entire run, as the plot arcs involving the two would often last across multiple episodes, usually ending each 3-4 minute vignette with a cliffhanger telling viewers to not miss the next episode (Ward, Box Top). Family Guy is typically self-contained outside of the occasional two or three part episode. Only major events in Family Guy’s universe, such as the death of a major character or the birth of a child, keep it continuous across the show’s time arc. However, running gags are still prevalent in both programs. In Rocky & Bullwinkle, the series most famous running gag is when Bullwinkle attempts to pull a rabbit out of his hat, but repeatedly pulls out the wrong animal (examples include a Lion, a Rhinoceros and a Bear). This is a gag that rewards viewers who have an understanding of prior episodes of the show (Caldwell). Family Guy like many modern sitcoms also uses this device, one of the most common starting in season one and occurring multiple times through 2012. Peter Griffin, the protagonist will be in the middle of an action in the episode and out of nowhere, an anthropomorphic, human sized chicken appears out of nowhere and they get into fights (spawning from the chicken giving him an expired coupon in season 2) that cause damage and chaos to all around them and usually go on for about 4 minutes (MacFarlane, Da Boom). These running gags are a treat for longtime viewers of the program and even provide some continuity for an episodic format show like Family Guy. Definitely worth noting in the Family Guy episode “The Thin White Line” is a reference to Rocky & Bullwinkle made when Peter reached into a tanning bed and accidentally pulled out a lion. He replies “Must have been the wrong hat” (the line Bullwinkle always used) and it switches to a wide shot with Rocky (voiced by June Foray) saying “and now, here’s something we hope you’ll really like” (MacFarlane, Thin). This gag was an excellent reference to Jay Ward and all the creators behind Rocky & Bullwinkle as without shows like that, Family Guy could be far different than what it has become.\n\nIn terms of format, the two programs were different. Rocky & Bullwinkle took on the format of a variety show, similar to that of Texaco Star Theatre and other variety-show style programs (Mann). Rocky and Bullwinkle served as the main characters of the program, and their serial plot lines came in short episodes at the start and the finish of each show, this was similar to radio serials that had aired in decades prior (Bill Scott). They, along with the narrator, also served as the pseudo hosts of the show, often using direct address and breaking the fourth wall to speak to their unseen audience. This is another trait that was common in variety show programs and that Caldwell would refer to as “Self-Reflexivity” (Caldwell) The rest of the episode consisted of Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales, Peabody’s Improbable History, and Mr. Know It All. This format is something not seen anymore, as this variety show style made sense during the transitional era of the 1960’s, but now, it would be hard to follow for the average television viewer.\n\nFamily Guy on the other hand uses the modern conventions of multiple plot lines within one episode. Each episode usually consists of a plot A, plot B, and plot C involving some or all of the main characters for each. This is commonplace in most sitcoms (Bunting) even dating back to the 1950’s; however what the show is best known for is its cutaway gags. These gags usually are twisted jabs at pop culture while ingratiating the show’s characters into the original moment from history or culture. Arguably the most famous is Peter proclaiming he is great at breaking bad news, the scene cuts to Peter singing as part of a barbershop quartet singing an original tune to a man in a hospital called “You have AIDS” (MacFarlane, Cleveland-Loretta). As previously stated, nothing is off limits in the eyes of McFarlane and his team of writers. The show did not function with a narrator, but like Rocky & Bullwinkle it often utilized self-reflexivity in breaking the fourth wall as well as intertextual references to jokes from earlier episodes. Another modern difference for Family Guy are the spinoffs and pseudo-spinoffs it spawned. Rather than use too many storylines in one episode or too many different characters like Rocky & Bullwinkle, MacFarlane created a spinoff, American Dad! In 2005 that used Family Guy-esque humor but was its own program that has been a success, and spawned the short-lived Cleveland Show, (it ran from 2009-2013) which followed Family Guy character Cleveland Brown as he moved to his home town and followed him and his step children. Like Rocky & Bullwinkle were similar to Dudley Do-Right and Peabody’s Improbable History, the shows were similar to the parent program, but were decidedly different enough to cultivate their own followings. People who initially tuned into Rocky & Bullwinkle would also watch Dudley Do-Right and Fractured Fairy Tales, whereas when American Dad! debuted, fans would watch Family Guy as a lead-in program and stay to watch American Dad!\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle and Family Guy are two programs that both managed to utilize their fair share of inside jokes, humor and cultural references that not all viewers would understand. According to Caldwell, this could be classified as “Trash TV” (Caldwell). In the 1960’s and even in the present, cartoons are often considered to be created for and aimed at children, however, Bullwinkle and Family Guy both aired in primetime during their runs on network television, and in doing so, they skewed towards an older audience. Caldwell writes, “trash shows defy conventional demographic categories. Many shows cross over in attempts to work both adult and child audiences, a trait that left theorists wondering if children got the loaded and ironic adult references” (Caldwell, 196). Both Family Guy and Rocky & Bullwinkle are loaded with in-jokes that children would find humorous but adults would better understand the reference. A primary example from Family Guy comes in the episode “North By North Quahog” a chase sequence initiates in true homage to the film The Blues Brothers, and to those who have seen the film, it is spot on. However, just before the chase, Peter remarks “this is more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down” and it shows a cutaway of Peter jumping onto a chair and falling over (MacFarlane, North). This ability to ingratiate a pop culture reference (the Blues Brothers) as well as an easy gag joke (chair) makes Family Guy a program that is easy for the pop culture savvy and the uninformed viewer to follow.\n\nCaldwell also discusses Postmodernism in his piece, and both shows utilize traits of Post-modernism, despite Rocky & Bullwinkle being made before the post-modern era reached it’s apex. Rocky & Bullwinkle and Family Guy both uses Caldwell’s concept of pastiche, which involves parodying and referencing another’s work but without regarding any of the original logic or intent of the original work (Caldwell). This allowed both shows to veer into surrealist humor without losing the audience. Frequent references and use of pastiche allowed for the audience to stay connected while the shows escaped reality, which as cartoons, is commonplace. The first plot line in Rocky & Bullwinkle involves Bullwinkle accidentally creating jet fuel from his grandmother’s recipe for Mooseberry Fudge Cake, but when they mix the ingredients, they end up on the moon (Ward, Jet). This episode debuted two years after Sputnik first left earth for orbit and the space race had begun, Ward and his writers utilized the idea of the space race but made fun of it by saying a simple cake recipe could accidentally launch the heroes into space. Family Guy deployed this same tactic of pastiche throughout many of its cutaway gags. Most notably, one involves Sesame Street character Cookie Monster in a rehab facility, as if his cookie addiction needed to be treated like a drug addiction (MacFarlane, Model). Without Jay Ward setting the precedent to use such pastiche regarding pop culture, MacFarlane and his writers may not have had as much success as they have with Family Guy.\n\nBoth programs debuted when comedy was in different styles. Rocky & Bullwinkle began in an era before stand up comedy and gross out humor were prevalent, they instead utilized smart pop culture jokes that made fun of the outside world that both kids and adults could watch and laugh at. Forty years later, Seth MacFarlane used the exact same style of smart humor and took it to the next level; this reflects the change in society that occurred. From the 1960’s to the 2000’s, some topics in society became far less taboo, sex was talked about more, and offensive humor became more commonplace. Television often serves as a picture of what is going on in the world outside (Sconce). Both these programs utilized this idea, but used comedy to ease people’s fears and anxieties about the realities of the cold war and post 9/11 America.\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle will serve as one of the most influential animated comedies to ever air on television. Its smart use of pop-culture; simple animation and reliance on talented voice actors gave the show staying power for many years after it was cancelled. It was a show like Rocky & Bullwinkle that allowed a struggling college animator and writer like Seth MacFarlane to take a comedy about a grousing middle class family and turn it into one of the biggest television empires in existence today.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBunting, Joe. “How to Use Layers to Enhance Your Plot.” The Write Practice.
