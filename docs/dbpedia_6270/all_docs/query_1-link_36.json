        "text": "The more I’ve learned about the Walt Disney Company the more it’s become clear to me that you can’t truly understand their history just by looking at their animated movies. Starting in the 1950s they began investing heavily into making live action films that also fit into their overall brand and would continue to make them simultaneously with their animated productions right up to this day. Disney’s live action work (and here I’m talking about the official Disney stuff with the castle logo, not their recent run of movies based on Marvel and Star Wars) has often been a sort of parallel Hollywood universe that existed alongside the other studios but which would generally use homegrown actors and directors rather than the stars that would be traded liberally between the other studios. The films in question generally don’t cross my path and tend not to stream and air from my usual classic movie sources and my hope is that looking into them will generally give me a richer idea of what the movie going landscape was like during various eras. Now, Disney made a TON of these movies and no one but the most devoted fanboys will watch all of them so my goal is to just look into their work during the 50s, 60s, and 70s and pick out some of their most notable films. I’m not planning to dig too deep into what they were doing during my own lifetime, and I’m probably not going to track down much of anything that’s not easily accessible on Disney+.\n\nTreasure Island (1950)\n\nThe effects of World War II on Disney have been pretty well documented and they were largely wound up in the effect it had on the European markets that had made Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs one of the biggest hits in cinema history up to that point. Weirdly enough these headaches persisted after the war ended and played a big role in pushing Disney into making its first live action films. Apparently after the war the UK was in some kind of complicated economic bind and had passed laws which imposed a gigantic tariff on films imported into the country and this essentially froze up a bunch of Disney’s funds in the country in such a way that required them to spend the money on films made in the country. Since their animation studio was in Los Angeles and there was no practical way to set up a new one elsewhere, the solution was to produce a series of live action films in the UK so they could be exporters rather than importers in the country and use those assets rather than having them sit there indefinitely. They chose as their first project an adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson’s youth adventure classic “Treasure Island” and also used it as another vehicle for their Song of the South and So Dear to My Heart star Bobby Driscoll, who they cast as Jim Hawkins.\n\nThe film pretty closely follows the plot outline of the original novel; this wasn’t the first adaptation and certainly wouldn’t be the last. For that matter it wouldn’t even be the last Disney adaptation as they did some versions for TV and would eventually bring it to space for Treasure Planet. It is, however, I think one of the more notable adaptations and solidified a lot of the pirate archetypes. Robert Newton’s performance as Long John Silver. Newton was a hard drinking man’s man who had a long resume of playing tough guys in British film and in this performance he used an exaggerated West Country accent which almost certainly played a major role in establishing what we now consider “pirate speak” of the “Avast ye mateys” variety. The rest of the cast was also decent, even Bobby Driscoll has grown a bit as an actor and is less annoying than in his other two big films. The film doesn’t exactly have epic production values but it doesn’t look cheap and I was also interested to see that the film didn’t feel as sanitized as they might in some of Disney’s animated films. The movie is not any more violent than the average western of the era but there was no hesitation here to have characters get shot and killed over the course of the adventure. In general I wouldn’t say that the movie is a major accomplishment or anything but as an old school adventure matinee it mostly holds up as good fun.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954)\n\nAfter having made a handful of adventure movies in England with varying degrees of box office success Disney found itself making something that was a lot more ambitious than what they had been doing in the live action world with their Jules Verne adaptation 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Of all the live action films that Disney made this in many ways feels the list like a “Disney movie” in part because of the presence of big stars from other studios like Kirk Douglas, James Mason, and Peter Lorre and it was directed by Richard Fleischer, a journeyman filmmaker who made a pretty solid career making large scale is perhaps slightly bland films like Tora! Tora! Tora! for other studios. It’s one of the first movies of any kind to use the cinemascope format and it’s generally made on a much larger scale and with a much larger budget than most of Disney’s live action films. You get the impression that Disney would normally save a story with fantastical elements like this for their animation department, but for whatever reason they opted not to this time and instead tried to compete with the other studios on their own turf for once.\n\nAs a production there’s a lot to appreciate in the film. The Nautilus set looks pretty sharp, and does a good job of feeling both Victorian and modern at the same time. The underwater photography is also very impressive considering that this was made a full ten years before Thunderball, which is my usual standard for this sort of thing. The film’s famous fight with a giant squid has perhaps aged a bit less gracefully and now works more on the level of camp than spectacle, but it is charming in its own way. Also rather dated are the depictions of black tribal islanders during one section, which definitely feels like it’s of the same era as the “What Made the Red Man Red” song from Peter Pan. The cast is also a bit of a mixed bag. James Mason is pretty great as Nemo and Paul Lukas is good as his counterpart. Kirk Douglas on the other hand feels a tad miscast as he’s a bit too much of an action hero to be playing what is actually kind of an impulsive ass of a character and Peter Lorre just generally seems a bit out of place as a sidekick/non bad guy. It’s also generally a rather talky movie and doesn’t really have that pacing you might expect from a family action movie, but usually in interesting ways. Overall the movie is about what you’d expect from a big budget Hollywood adaptation of this book during this era but perhaps not a definitive and unmissable one.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nOld Yeller (1957)\n\nAfter the budget for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea went way over and the movie ended up just breaking even despite being a hit Disney clearly decided to scale back and make their live action films on more of a modest budget and targeted more specifically to kids and families. One of those films was Old Yeller an adaptation of the young adult novel of the same name by Fred Gipson which had only just been published a year before the film came out so clearly it built its reputation quickly. I never read that book (my elementary school’s dead redneck dog book of choice was Where the Red Fern Grows) but its reputation proceeded it… or at least the reputation of the film and book’s ending proceeded it. Basically every generation has their own little list of movies that traumatized them as children whether its Gen Xers scared that E.T. was going to die or Silent Generation kids being sad for Bambi’s mother or the kids today who got to see Thanos wipe half their favorite superheroes out of existence. For boomers a major cinematic trauma seems to have been the scene at the end of this when Travis has to shoot his now rabid dog to put it out of its misery and prevent it from biting and infecting anyone. This scene has so eclipsed the rest of the movie in the minds of the public that there are major parts of the movie (like the fact that it’s set in post-Civil War Texas) that I knew next to nothing about.\n\nThe movie essentially concerns an interesting twist on the western genre as it shows what goes on at a ranch while the family patriarch is away on a cattle drive and also sort of falls under the “the one summer that changed my life” genre of coming of age stories. If follows some of the usual beats of a “boy raises dog” story with the twist that the protagonist actively dislikes the dog for a while in the film for seemingly no reason before finally coming around. The production values here are, well they’re average. The frontier scenery is decent but hardly breathtaking and the film is pretty good at utilizing trained animals to get through its story. The performances aren’t terribly good and a lot of them employ questionable Southern accents but they’re not terrible either. If there’s any real sin here it’s just that the whole story is kind of uneventful beyond what now (and probably then) seemed like pretty standard coming of age clichés. The film’s ending certainly didn’t make me cry but it was less wildly manipulative than I expected it to be and the film’s epilogue with Travis’ father essentially debriefing him on his pooch assassination to be pretty respectable in its own traditionally corny kind of way. The whole movie is generally very much a product of the 1950s; the nuclear family is very much the default, parents are always right, and child rearing is heavily focused on instilling responsibility over personal development. Overall it’s not poorly made for what it is but it’s pretty far removed from my personal sensibilities.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nThe Shaggy Dog (1959)\n\nMore than any other golden age studio I associate Disney with “living color.” They did of course have a history of black and white shorts in their very early days like “Steamboat Willie” but even their earliest animated features were in color as were almost all of their live action films. Hell, they even had a T.V. show called “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color” all about how awesome it is to broadcast things in color. There were, however, apparently some exceptions and their 1959 film The Shaggy Dog was one of them. This is not one of those Disney movies that people have heartfelt memories of; there might be some boomers who have some nostalgia for it but most people kind of view it as a bit of 50s kitsch that was one of Disney’s dumber efforts and I’d say it lives up to that. The film is set in the most suburban of suburbs and has the exact same aesthetic as the 50s family sitcoms like “Father Knows Best” that would become rather loaded in the years after for their rather plastic depiction of bland white Americana. Fred MacMurray stars as a slightly silly family patriarch, which is a bit different from the darker roles I was used to seeing him in in Billy Wilder movies, but I think this is more representative of the kind of stuff he did for most of his career. Old Yeller star Tommy Kirk plays the lead here. Kirk was another one of the kid stars that Disney scooped up and then abandoned, in this case because they found out he was gay and possibly a barbiturate addict, and he would spend the rest of his career making moribund beach blanket movies like the MST3K film Catalina Caper. Here he’s a pretty all-American wholesome teen character though.\n\nThe film’s rather dopey premise is that the Tommy Kirk character stumbles upon a magic ring which makes him randomly turn into a sheepdog owned by one of his neighbors (he doesn’t switch roles with the pooch, the real dog just disappears when this happens) and then deals with that while going through his mundane suburban issues. While in dog form the boy still has full consciousness and is able to speak English but needs to avoid giving himself away because his dad is allergic to canines and is generally hostile toward them. The effect of him talking while in dog form is done with some sort of animatronic puppet and I suspect the film was shot in black and white in order to make that visual effect look better. The whole thing pretty much goes how you’d expect it to… until the protagonist finds out that his neighbors are spies not unlike Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who are plotting to steal government secrets from a nearby rocket facility in order to sell them to the Russians… didn’t really see that coming. But even with this development the film doesn’t take itself too seriously and instead maintains its comedic tone… but it’s not very funny, or at least it’s not any more funny than those bad “Leave it to Beaver” sitcoms that it was modeled after and the whole transforming dog bit doesn’t really do enough to make this feel like actual cinema rather than a glorified TV show. Not recommended as anything other than a historical curiosity.\n\n** out of Five\n\nDarby O’Gill and the Little People (1959)\n\nMy knowledge about this movie consisted of exactly one piece of trivia: it was Sean Connery’s one big role before he became a superstar as James Bond. Saying it’s “his” movie is probably an exaggeration, he’s billed third here but it’s a factoid that comes up from time to time in discussions of the actor’s career and were it not for that there’s a pretty good chance I never would have selected this movie for this marathon through Disney’s live action films of the 50s. The film was based on short stories by Herminie Templeton Kavanagh, a late 19th/early 20th century woman of Irish descent who lived in America for most of her life. The film is set in Ireland and is meant to be a big celebration of that country that would appeal to Irish Americans who felt warmth for “the homeland” but perhaps not much of a desire to actually go there. The movie depicts the country in the most stereotypical Disneyfied way imaginable. Half the cast is speaking in an exaggerated “oirish” accents and everything’s green and filled with shamrocks and all the rest of the touristy shit that actual Irish people hate and make fun of. Most prominently the “little people” in the title are full on leprechauns.\n\nMuch of the plot concerns Darby O’Gill, an old groundskeeper at a local mansion owned by some local lord, who spends most of the movie trying to capture the king of the local leprechauns who continually fucks with the old man. Darby is a strange choice of protagonist for a family movie given that he is a septuagenarian that kids are unlikely to relate to, which is something that could be made to work in theory but doesn’t here. Sean Connery plays a young Dubliner who has recently moved to the town and has been hired as Darby’s replacement. He’s fine. I doubt the locals were much impressed by his accent but that’s the least of what they’ll be offended by here. He eventually becomes a love interest for Darby’s daughter, which is a little odd given his future star persona as a sleazy womanizer and some of his real life statements about domestic violence, but I’m sure it would seem like a reasonably sweet romance to people in 1959. Really the movie is just overwhelmingly lame and kind of pointless. They seemingly had no real goal here except to make the most Irish movie to ever Irish and give them something to play on TV every St. Patrick’s Day.\n\n*1/2 out of Five\n\nPollyanna (1960)\n\n“Pollyanna” was a novel written by Eleanor H. Porter in 1913 and became a pretty famous work and sort of sits with books like “Little Women” and “Heidi” as books that are traditionally given to preteen girls. The book has kind of gained a reputation for being cringingly saccharine, not just from cynical shits like me but from normal people to. In fact the very name “Pollyanna” has become something of a byword for a sort of unproductive naiveté with people routinely being accused of being “Pollyannaish” which the dictionary defines as a person or idea that is “unreasonably or illogically optimistic.” Still, it’s considered a classic of American wholesomeness so it was probably not too much of a surprise that Walt Disney would get his mits on it and in 1960 the Walt Disney Company released what was the second major adaptation of the book after a popular 1920 adaptation with Mary Pickford. To make it they brought in a guy named David Swift, who had been an office boy at Disney in the 1930s but left during World War II and after the war began working in television during the 1950s and was brought back to Disney for this project which he really made it his baby; he wrote the script, co-produced it, and directed the film and got to work with some decently famous actors from outside the Disney stable like Jane Wyman, Karl Malden, and Agnes Moorehead. For the title character they brought in thirteen year old Hayley Mills, the daughter of the veteran British character actor John Mills, who generally seems to have had a healthier career and life than most of the other child stars that went through this studio.\n\nThe plot here is that the titular girl is an orphan who arrives in a small town called Harrington to live at an orphanage owned by her aunt, who is a part of a fairly prominent family in the town. The film essentially depicts here attempts to establish herself in this town and how the town affects her and how she affects the town. Given the book’s reputation for sickly sweetness attempts were made to adjust the material to be a little more grounded. In fact Swift was quoted as saying “in the book Pollyanna was so filled with happiness and light that I wanted to kick her… Now she is shy.” In theory this is exactly what I’d want to hear from someone making a version of this book and Hayley Mills does make the character a bit more believable. However, there’s really only so much you can do to make this story non-saccharine and “Pollyanna” even at a 50% dosage is still too much for my tastes, and there’s a good chance that the people who actually like that shit might find it a bit light on the corniness. I almost wonder if they would have been better off just going all in and making the most sickening movie possible, I still wouldn’t have liked it but I might have at least found it memorable. Instead what we get feels like a pretty standard period drama/literary adaptation and one that comes to really wear out its welcome at two hours and fifteen minutes. Not a movie to be hated, but not one I’ll be thinking about much in a week.\n\n** out of Five\n\nCollecting Some Thoughts\n\nWell, that started pretty promising but sort of went downhill from there. Treasure Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea were both pretty cool adventure stories that were made on impressive budgets and were generally a lot of fun but then things got a lot more modest and a lot less distinctive. Old Yeller at least had a certain gravitas but The Shaggy Dog and Darby O’Gill and the Little People were just dumb and Pollyanna was forgettable. Still, most of these movies had reference points that were worth knowing about and I don’t regret checking them out while they were freely available to me.\n\nThis is part two of a two-part retrospective of Disney’s live-action/animation hybrids. For part 1 check here.\n\nMary Poppins (1964)\n\nI’ve said many times that I absolutely despise the movie Mary Poppins even though I’d only been something like 60% sure I’d even seen it. I knew for sure that I’d seen large portions of the movie over the years and I’ve hated what I’d seen but I wasn’t sure I’d seen it from beginning to end, and if I had it was when I was very very little and wasn’t really in the best of positions to give a reasoned opinion about it. So I decided to more or less watch it anew for the first time as an adult for this Disneyology installment and I was very ready to revise my opinion of it like I had with previous Disney movies like Lady and the Tramp or at the very least come to the conclusion that it wasn’t “so bad,” but nah, this movie sucks.\n\nThe film is something of an aberration for Disney as it in many ways felt like an attempt to more directly compete with the musicals that the other studios were making rather than something that would strictly fit within their own brand, and looking at you can see why it would be pretty comparable to stuff like My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music. Now, I’m not a musical person and to my eyes those movies are themselves too sugary sweet for their own good, so to take that formula and then make things even more saccharine and family directed and you’re really messing with some dangerous territory. The film is almost wall to wall musical numbers, many of them featuring songs that have been so heavily repeated in the culture that they’re hard to really evaluate on their own at this point. “A Spoonful of Sugar” sounds like it could basically be at home in any musical whereas “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and “Chim Chim Cher-ee” both indulge The Sherman Brothers’ rather annoying penchant for making songs out of nonsense syllables. There isn’t really as much animation mixed in here as I was expecting and the few animated sections that are here don’t impress me spectacularly. The film apparently used some pretty innovative proto-bluescreen technology but the actual animation is the same kind of scratchy “Xeroxed” stuff Disney was using for their animated features.\n\nIf I had a central complaint about the movie it’s that Mary Poppins herself is not really a character. That’s somewhat by design as she is seemingly quite literally not supposed to be human, but for narrative purposes she’s still essentially a manic pixie dream babysitter who exist to show up in the kids’ life, take them on these endless whimsical adventures that are largely disconnected from one another and then more or less inadvertently make their father less uptight. If the movie Saving Mr. Banks is to be believed that redemption ark for the father was extremely important to the original author of the books this was based on and I must say she was right to not care for the film’s treatment of that character the movie views him one dimensionally. It’s basically just the prototypical family movie that exists to shame fathers for having jobs and, like, not wanting to come home to find a bunch of weird chimneysweeps dancing through his house. And then Dick Van Dyke is here as this peripheral side character who behaves like a dope and has an infamously horrible cockney accent (seriously, British people cannot shut up about how much they hate his voice in this). The movie is largely premised on the assumption that the audience will find the various musical numbers and hijinx this crew goes on very amusing and I really don’t, almost every bit goes on way longer than it probably should as does the movie itself, which runs a good two hours and twenty minutes despite being largely devoid of substance. Just a painfully unpleasant experience for someone with my sensibilities.\n\n*1/2 out of Five\n\nBedknobs and Broomsticks (1971)\n\nDuring the contentious negotiations with P. L. Travers for the rights to Mary Poppins there came to be certain moments when it looked like they would never be able to make that movie and as a fallback they picked up the rights to the children’s book “The Magic Bedknob & Bonfires and Broomsticks” by Mary Norton and considered applying their live action/animation hybrid ideas to that instead, but eventually Travers caved and Mary Poppins was back on. After that movie became a giant hit they weren’t quite sure whether to strike while the iron was hot and get out a similar movie based on Norton’s book or to drop that idea because it would look like a retread. After Walt Disney’s death they did return to the idea of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and the film they came up with is often kind of viewed as the redheaded step-sibling of Mary Poppins. I’d heard the film’s title here and there but had never seen it and frankly didn’t know much of anything about it aside from the Mary Poppins association and basically didn’t know what to expect from it but my expectations were very low. Mary Poppins is annoying enough to me and seeing some second rate lesser version of something I don’t like seemed like it would be quite the endurance test, but while I certainly didn’t like the movie I was rather pleasantly surprised to find I generally rather preferred it to its predecessor.\n\nThe similarities between Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks should be readily apparent to even the most casual observers. They’re both anglophilic musicals about plucky magical women intervening into the lives of a family and going on whimsical magic adventures including one that’s animated. David Tomlinson is in both films, but here he’s closer to being in the Dick Van Dyke ally in whimsical fun role while the oldest of the three children takes more of the stick-in-the-mud role that Tomlinson held in Mary Poppins. The biggest difference between the films is that Julie Andrew’s titular protagonist has been replaced by Angela Lansbury’s Miss Eglantine Price, who is a different character in many ways. Price is not depicted as some kind of perfect pixie like Poppins was but is instead a rather fallible human who is only just becoming involved in (friendly) witchcraft. This isn’t to say she’s any kind of deep character and there is certainly a lot of Disney in her but she isn’t the same kind of paragon of wholesomeness. The kids here also aren’t the perfectly behaved moppets we got in Mary Poppins and are actually kind of brats who actually stand to learn something from the evens of the film. Furthermore, the actual animation hybrid scenes here are generally more interesting than the ones in Mary Poppins, particularly the “Beautiful Brimy Sea” sequence which feels like a predecessor of some of the stuff we’d eventually see in The Little Mermaid and the sequence of animals playing soccer, which is a solid comic cartoon in its own right.\n\nSo, if this movie is in many ways better than Mary Poppins why is that one viewed as a beloved classic while this follow-up is kind of ignored? Well, partly it’s a matter of there being no accounting for good taste, but the bigger factor is almost certainly context. Mary Poppins came out in 1964 and was perfectly aligned with the tastes of that era while Bedknobs and Broomsticks came out in 1971 and kind of a lot had happened between those two years and in many ways Bedknobs and Broomsticks felt like a complete dinosaur in a year that gave us much grittier fare for adults and also the much more popular Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory for kids and drug users. Also, while I may have said some nice things about Bedknobs and Broomsticks those were only in comparison to the relatively rank Mary Poppins, on its own I do not consider Bedknobs and Broomsticks to actually be “good,” in fact there are plenty of bad things about Mary Poppins that it carries over without improving, namely the fact that it’s still in many ways structured like a series of sketches rather than a story and that a lot of them really wear out their welcome after a while. And the one thing that Mary Poppins almost certainly does do better than Bedknobs and Broomsticks is music as the latter movie doesn’t have a single song that I found to be overly memorable or good. So this is certainly not a movie for me either, but I do find it weird that the rankings of the two films seems to be backwards.\n\n** out of Five\n\nPete’s Dragon (1977)\n\nWhile it’s pretty easy to pair up Song of the South with So Dear to My Heart and to pair Mary Poppins with Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Disney’s 1977 live-action animation hybrid Pete’s Dragon does not as easily fit in within a clear Disney trend (that I’m aware of). Honestly I wasn’t sure what to expect from the movie; I knew of the film as a child but I don’t think I ever saw it and it doesn’t really get talked about all that much and I’m not sure how remembered it is. I think I expected it to be a short small scale movie for particularly small children, but it was actually a full on musical with reasonably large production values and its existence makes very little sense in 1977. I’ve talked about this before but the 70s were generally kind of a terrible decade for Disney, in part because there simply weren’t as many kids as their used to be. The baby boomers had grown up, so that population spike was no longer in Disney’s demo and the next population spike (the millennials) had not come along yet. So that’s a big part of why pop culture in general was relatively adult during that decade; music was dominated by rockers and singer-songwriters and the movies that excited people were either social realist movies or violent exploitation flicks. Disney only released three major animated movies during the decade and I would argue that most of them were pretty weak (I know Robin Hood has its fans), and it was also a pretty terrible decade for the traditional Hollywood musical. There were some stragglers in the very early 70s like Fiddler on the Roof, some experiments in modernizing the form for a new era like Caberet, and there were some counter-culture based musicals like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but by the late 70s Hollywood was done with bubbly musical numbers (Grease notwithstanding) and yet along came Disney with this thing.\n\nI was pretty surprised at exactly how much of a musical the movie was, there’s almost wall to wall musical numbers each one going pretty long and many of them with full on Hollywood dance choreography to go with it. All of this is a tad odd as the movie isn’t exactly going for that widescreen roadshow look you expect from traditional musicals but it is very much playing with that film grammar and the live action filmmaking is generally more competent than in some of Disney’s earlier live action/animation hybrids. Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn’s songs here don’t really seem to be terribly popular, probably because a lot of them wouldn’t work terribly well outside the context of the plot, but I generally found more to like in them than in a lot of the Sherman Brothers’ music from the last two movies even if I think the movie generally would have benefited from cutting a few songs and shortening the ones that are there. The animation here is also distinct from what we saw in the previous live-action/animation hybrids is that, rather than having certain fully animated sequences or animated sequences with humans walking through them, this movie uses animation more as a visual effect the way filmmakers would use CGI now to bring the titular dragon to the screen even though he’s a rather silly looking 2D animated cartoon rather than something that’s actually trying to look “real.” It almost certainly isn’t a coincidence that this was directed by Don Chaffey, who also directed a lot of the Ray Harryhausen effects movies and is probably something of a unsung innovator in visual effects direction.\n\nNow, having said some nice things about how this movie was made, there’s still a whole lot about this movie which is intolerably corny. Even by Disney standards this movie takes place in a world where the good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Pete himself is another insanely clean-cut white boy out of a Horatio Alger book, his dragon is this cuddly cartoon, and the people who take him in are these saintly parental figures. Meanwhile the villains of the film are this insane family of hillbillies and a snake oil salesman who has a very Snidely Whiplash demeanor who sings a whole song about how he’s an evil person who will kill the dragon out of pure greed. The movie also tends to swing pretty dramatically from the kid wanting to keep his dragon a secret and just openly talking about it and making himself look crazy in the process. It’s all very silly. Yeah it’s meant for kids… but what kids? This must have seemed incredibly square to all but the lamest of the emerging Gen X kids who had just made Star Wars into a blockbuster earlier that year. As such the movie only kind of came and went at the box office and was viewed as something of a disappointment by Disney brass and they would more or less leave the whole live action/animation musical hybrid thing behind.\n\n** out of Five\n\nEnchanted (2007)\n\nAfter Pete’s Dragon Disney wouldn’t make another major live/animation hybrid for another thirty years until the release of the 2007 film Enchanted, and admittedly calling Enchanted a live action/animation hybrid is a bit of a stretch. The film does begin with a scene of traditional animation and briefly has another such scene but 95% of the film is either live action (or CGI effects) and the animated segments are more or less pure animation that doesn’t incorporate live action actors. Having said that the movie doesn’t really fit well in any of the studios other usual trends but is nonetheless kind of an important release by them. It came out right when Disney was in the process of switching from making traditionally animated films of their own separate from Pixar and at the time their live action family movies were pretty disconnected from the studio’s legacy and branding. This however was extremely connected to the Disney brand, in fact it was a sort of parody of their signature style and their first three “princess” movies in particular and it predated their upcoming attempts to revive that old style by a good three years.\n\nThe film begins in an animated sequence that is essentially an exaggerated version of what we saw in Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. This ends in the our princess (well, soon-to-be-princess) being sent through a portal by the villainess (who probably could have saved herself a lot of trouble by just killing her) and winds up being transported from the animated universe into modern day Time Square, at which point it becomes a live action fish out of water story along the lines of Splash. In this Amy Adams deserves a lot of credit for really committing to this performance as a hyper-wholesome lady with naïve Disney notions of love at first sight and the like. She also needs to sing as the film is also a musical of sorts, one that doesn’t have a ton of songs but does have at least two rather notable numbers both written by Disney veteran Alan Menken the lyricist Stephen Schwartz and she acquits herself well on that front. There are some other performances here that stand out; James Marsden is also strong as the dimwitted prince who chases Adams into the real world and if nothing else it’s amusing to see Timothy Spall show up in a movie like this as the henchman.\n\nSo there are some amusing things in the movie but I must say that as a parody of Disney movies I found the movie to be toothless to the point of just being a rather pointless piece of work. The film’s screenplay was written in the 90s and was not necessarily meant to be produced by Disney itself and was meant to be a more adult oriented satire and you can pretty easily see the roots of that in the movie. The basic concept of this G-rated heroine being dropped into the real world is kind of undercut by the fact that the New York she’s dropped into is itself rather cleaned up and PG rather than being the mean streets that would really clash with her aura. Even without the more adult humor this could have still been a lot better if it had simply had more of a philosophy to it but Disney never really lets it. It basically sets up this satire about everything wrong with their old princess movies and why they’re sexist and nonsensical but then it never really goes in for the kill shot and instead just transitions into some silliness where they fight a CGI dragon. The movie also doesn’t really put a lot of effort into arguing the opposite, that this person’s innocence is admirable and replicable, so it’s really kind of a pointless movie about nothing albeit one with some fun moments along the way.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nCollecting Some Thoughts\n\nWell, I think that’s the most negative I’ve ever been on one of these Disneyology things, not a single positive score in the bunch. Even at the darkest periods of their fully animated run Disney would usually had at least one winner in each bunch but not here. Clearly I’m not very receptive to what the Mouse House was going for with these movies, but I still feel like this was worth doing. Having an informed opinion on Song of the South has been on my “to do” list for a while, I’ve also been meaning to make sure that I have actually seen Mary Poppins and thinking Bedknobs and Broomsticks is superior to it will be a fun hot take to trot out from time to time. Enchanted is also a somewhat important movie in Disney’s recent history that is worth knowing about and even Pete’s Dragon had a couple of slightly charming elements worth knowing about… probably could have gone without seeing So Dear to My Heart though, that thing was dull.\n\nThree years ago I embarked on a rather ambitious project to watch and write about all of Disney’s animated films for a series I called Disneyology 101. That worked out well enough, but there was still some unfinished business left over and I seek to correct that with a new series called Disneyology 201 which looks the company’s basic canon of feature length animated films and explores some of the other nooks and crannies of the company’s legacy. This will likely be done sporadically with long pauses between installments rather than the quick pace I kept when doing Disneyology 101 (expect it to correlate heavily with new seasons of “The Mandalorian” and the MCU shows because I do not intend to stay subscribed to Disney+ permanently). For the first installment I intend to look at the live action films that Disney made over the years which heavily combined in elements of traditional 2D animation. This was something the company would uses sporadically over their history after first pioneering it in the 40s and then reviving it in the 60s and 70s, but they would ultimately only use it for a handful of films, opting instead to focus primarily on either pure animation or pure live action for the vast majority of their films. Of course to really examine this topic one must first begin with the film that started it all, 1946’s Song of the South, a work of such infamy that I will likely focus most of my attention to part one of this retrospective exclusively on it.\n\nSong of the South (1946)\n\nOn November 12th 1946 Walt Disney staged the world premiere of his new film, Song of the South, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta Georgia, not far from where Gone With the Wind had premiered seven years earlier. And like the premiere of that film, stars James Baskett and Hattie McDaniel were refused entry to their own premiere because Atlanta’s strict segregation laws would not allow an event of this nature to be integrated. From that rather unpleasant beginning the film would go on to be, by far, the most controversial film Disney ever put out and has been on something of a roller coaster between public embrace and public disdain. The movie earned mixed reviews upon first release and was only a moderate box office success but was not a beloved hit. James Baskett would go on to receive an honorary Oscar for his performance (something his boss Walt Disney almost certainly pulled some strings to make happen) and the film also earned an Oscar for its main song and most enduring element “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” but aside from that it sort of came and went during a time when Disney was not really at the top of its game. The film would go on to earn more money upon re-release, including some rather disturbingly successful runs in the 70s and 80s where it was likely actually seen by more people that it was back in 1946 and it would eventually become the thematic basis for the popular Disneyland attraction Splash Mountain. Those re-releases did however garner the film increased scrutiny for its retrograde racial depictions and in the time since then as Disney grew larger and became more image-conscious they’ve come to view the film as an embarrassment and have refused to distribute on home video for the last thirty or so years and likely do not intend to do so in the future.\n\nAs the film has been removed from the public eye its split the opinions of fans down the middle with some saying it’s been unfairly maligned and others suggesting it’s even worse than its reputation and it’s been hard for anyone to make up their own mind on the topic because they can’t see it for themselves. As such I’ve managed to obtain a copy (through legally ambiguous means) and decided to finally watch the movie and figure out where I stand on it. I hope to figure out three things: is the movie as racist as its reputation suggests? What does it say about the Walt Disney Corporation’s history? How do I feel about its effective “cancellation” by its own creators? And, most importantly, is the damn thing even any good to begin with?\n\nI’ll start with that last question: no, the damn thing is not any good to begin with… or at least it’s probably not good enough to be worth all this trouble. The film is ostensibly set during reconstruction (though a year is never quoted in the movie and audiences could well mistake it as being set in the antebellum) on a Southern plantation that a seven year old white kid travels to in order to live with his grandmother and mother for a period while his father is away. While there the kid meets a kindly old black man named Uncle Remus (who is presumably a former slave) who takes to telling him a bunch of folk stories about a character named “Br’er Rabbit” which help him with some of his mundane white kid problems like dealing with local redneck bullies, but his mother becomes wary of the influence these stories are having for… reasons… and it all culminates in the kid getting injured after he stupidly runs into a bull’s pen… but he gets better and everyone’s happy.\n\nSo, as you can probably tell that’s a really simple story that really doesn’t have a lot going on in it. The biggest conflict in the whole thing is a the mother’s uncertainty about the influence of Remus’ stories on the child, but her reasons for feeling this way are never clear and she just sort of gets over it at the end. Beyond that it’s just a very episodic and insubstantial story that just kind of exists to act as a framing narrative to include the animated segments that illustrate Remus’ stories. In fact I kind of suspect that if Walt Disney had had his druthers the whole movie would have just been an animated film about these Br’er Rabbit stories as they are very plainly the aspect of the film everyone put the most work into. So why were the live action sections included? Probably as a cost cutting measure. Disney was not in good financial shape in 1946, the war had really desimated their productivity and had cut off lucrative European markets. In the eight years between Bambi (1942) and Cinderella (1950) they didn’t really have the funds to make feature length films outside of commissioned war propaganda and compromised shorts compilation package films. So, making a live action hybrid like this was a good way to make a film where they’d only have to make some twenty minutes of animation and then pad the rest of the film out with this cheap half-assed story about happy southerners living together.\n\nBut what of the animated segments? They’re alright, at least on a technical level. The film’s famous “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” sequence does stand out, firstly because that song is quite the earworm and secondly because it really stands out after thirty some minutes of lifeless inanity. The rest of the animated sequences (though frequently offensive in their own right, more on that later) are sporadically entertaining, but they aren’t really offering much you can’t otherwise get in your average Warner Brothers cartoon and they don’t singlehandedly save the movie which is, frankly, quite boring. If you aren’t interested in looking at this film historically and parsing its racial politics it is simply not a very entertaining experience, so if you’ve been craving this piece of forbidden fruit you really aren’t missing anything that special.\n\nSo, is this thing racist or what? Short answer, yes. Having said that, the movie isn’t necessarily as aggressively offensive as you may think given the endless cloud of controversy it exists under. This isn’t The Birth of a Nation, and for that matter I’m not sure I’d say it’s any more racist than Gone With the Wind, and I also don’t think it was necessarily made with malice. At its worst the movie basically just makes the same mistake that their more contemporary bad idea of a movie Pocahontas made: thinking they could just whitewash the hell out of a very dark period of American history. The post-war South was not a fun time or place to be an African American; people were pushed into poverty, the Ku Klux Klan was in ascendance, former “masters” were openly hostile, and lynching was an ever-present threat… but you wouldn’t know that from watching this movie. Here Uncle Remus is happy to still be serving his former owners, as is the maid “Aunt Tempe” played by Hattie McDaniel, and the only other African American of note in the film is this sort of wild mostly personality free kid that our white protagonist befriends: an “Uncle Tom,” a “Mammy,” and a “Pickaninny.” Remus has basically no internal life or ambition in life other than to help this white kid and we see nothing of the scars he would almost certainly bear from years of enslavement. Meanwhile its left unsaid how these white people got this plantation or if they were former slave owners, but that’s kind of the most logical assumption to make, especially given the undying loyalty their servants seem to show toward them. And of course all this is if you follow the company line that this is all happening in the post-war era, as I said before the film is fairly ambiguous about when its set and I’m sure plenty of audiences have assumed that this is a plantation, that these happy black people are straight-up slaves, and that paints an even darker picture of how much about “the South” this film is lying about by omission.\n\nFor a while Disney’s approach to handling the movie was essentially to strip it for parts. They’d include “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” in their musical compilations and they’d use the “Br’er Rabbit” sections out of context in places like Splash Mountain under the assumption that it was the film’s live action segments that were the “real” bad parts and that they animated bits everyone actually liked were innocent but that isn’t really the case. “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” is, in fact, heavily influenced by the minstrel show standard “Zip Coon” (the problematic nature of which likely does not require explanation) and also draws on some rather racially insensitive versions of “Turkey in the Straw.” As for the “Br’er Rabbit” cartoons? Well, they and the Uncle Remus character are ultimately drawn from the work of a white southerner named Joel Chandler Harris who claimed these stories to have been drawn from authentic slave folklore but he almost certainly put them through a white guy filter and each of the film’s animated segments have some rather unsavory subtext if you’re looking at them in context. The first story involves the rabbit trying to travel away from his warren only to then encounter a fight with Br’er Fox and Br’er Bear, which is supposed to teach him that his home is where he belongs even if he thinks he doesn’t like it. It’s hard not to watch that and not view it as some sort of allegory for the Great Migration North that many African Americans of the period made to escape overt violence from the KKK and others, and in that context this “moral” is rather dubious. The next animated segment is even more undeniably odious as it involves Br’er Fox trying to trap Br’er Rabbit by placing a baby doll at the side of the road which he made out of hot tar… a “tar baby” if you will to ensnare this rabbit in hot goo… does the offensiveness of this need further explanation?\n\nSo, not a very good movie, and I wouldn’t recommend renting it or buying it if you could… but you can’t. So what do I think about Dinsney’s decision to keep this thing out of circulation? Well, given that I just watched the movie it would be a little hypocritical of me to say “I can watch this, but you can’t handle it.” Obviously there are plenty of “good” reasons to want to watch this movie and examine its legacy and people who want to do that should ideally have some sort of access to it. What’s more there are certainly ways to release these sort of dated products in a respectful way which provides context for what you’re watching and outlets like Criterion and Kino put out all sorts of things that are almost certainly more problematic than this and they do it well. Having said all that, Disney is not Criterion and for that matter it’s not even Warner Brothers. “Disney” is a brand name that is synonymous with family entertainment and also with the mass market, they aren’t really capable of targeting niche cinephille markets like Criterion can nor can they simply release something “for adults” like Warner can when they put out Gone With the Wind blu-rays. There would be something rather obscene about Disney “letting the movie out of the vault” and putting out a “75th Anniversary Diamond Edition Blu-Ray” out on the shelf for anyone to pick up and unsuspectingly shot to the tots at will and it would probably be just as ill-advised to throw it onto Disney+ next to The Lion King for any four year old to stumble across. On some level I think Disney knows that they can’t really present this thing without crassly monetizing it and in a way I respect the self-awareness in that and don’t really blame them for not wanting to “go there.”\n\n*1/2 out of Five\n\nSo Dear to My Heart (1948)\n\nTwo years after the release of Song of the South Disney released another film combining live action and animated elements called So Dear to My Heart which I think was meant as a sort of spiritual sequel which did for the Midwest what its predecessor did for the South. The film has not had the same kind of infamous legacy as Song of the South, but it hasn’t really had much of a legacy at all… in fact it’s kind of fallen into obscurity. I actually did encounter this once at a summer program when I was about ten or eleven. It was a rainy day so during the time we’d normally be outside the old lady who was running things decided to just huddle everyone in the cafeteria and play a movie and this was the VHS she brought in. I’d never heard of it and upon hearing the title I thought it sounded so lame that I just went to the back of the room and played Go Fish with a friend rather than watch it and having seen it now I can say… I didn’t miss much.\n\nThe film stars Bobby Driscoll, who was also the main white kid in Song of the South. I didn’t talk much about him when I looked at that movie because there were bigger fish to fry, but he was a kid that Disney decided to invest in pretty heavily during the late forties and early fifties when they put him in these two movies as well as their fully live action Treasure Island and would also make him the voice of Peter Pan. They then pretty much dropped him when he stopped being a cute kid however and he would go on to have a terribly life even by child star standards… to the point that when he died a drug related death at age 31 people didn’t even recognize his body and he wouldn’t be identified until two years later. Anyway, I hate the little shit, he’s one of these irritatingly clean-cut 50s kids who seems to really like saying “Gee Wiz” a lot. Anyway, the movie is pretty much built around this kid and is this inane story about a farm kid raising a sheep and hoping to bring it to the county fair in order to win a prize. The animation comes in when the kid has some weird hallucinations about a owl giving him advice and they’re generally average to uninspired.\n\nThe film’s semi-random song about the bravery of Christopher Columbus hasn’t aged well but the film is otherwise very very white and generally devoid of any people or color or much of anything else that could be considered controversial. It’s basically all the things that made Song of the South a rather boring viewing experience but none of the retrograde racial politics that I had so much “fun” parsing. On some level I guess the fact that this isn’t overtly offensive makes it “better,” but also makes it a lot less noteworthy. Also the animated sequences feel more disconnected than they did in that movie and there isn’t any music that’s nearly as earwormy as “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.” In general with So Dear to My Heart we get a glimpse at the disinterest people would probably have in Song of the South if not for the fact that it was a touchstone for controversy. It’s decidedly inessential.\n\n*1/2 out of Five\n\nContinued in Part 2\n\nIt’s reasonable to believe the people at Disney were in something of a state of denial during the early 2000s. They knew that the formula that worked so well for them in the early 90s was losing its appeal and that they’d have to find a new way of making movies but I don’t think they realized immediately just how much trouble they were in. Over the course of the last phase I looked at you could see Disney trying to find new ways to thrive through slight adjustments before realizing that they were in such a deep hole that they’d essentially have to burn everything down and start over, this time as a CGI animation studio. In this Eighth and final installment of Disneyology we’ll look at an era that was almost certainly Disney’s lowest point, lower even than the so called “Disney Dark Age” that would eventually bring on the “Disney Renaissance.” In this era Disney would exhaust the last of its traditionally animated films before making some unsure baby steps into the world of CGI animation and slowly start to make more respectable films in that format while also taking one last look at what came before.\n\nBrother Bear (2003)\n\nWhen Treasure Planet failed spectacularly the writing was on the wall: Disney’s animation division needed to change and once again Roy Disney emerged to and started another “save Disney” campaign. That is a long story that would eventually result in the ousting of Michael Eisner from his position as CEO of Disney, but what’s most relevant is that it made it clear to all involved that the animated film division was not going to be able to keep doing traditionally animated movies for much longer. Of course major conglomerates don’t change overnight, especially not when they were working at a pace fast enough to put out multiple movies a year previously, so there were a couple of traditionally animated movies that were deep enough in production that they would still be finished and put out while the company charted out its new course. One of those movies was their 2003 release Brother Bear, which was first conceived after the success of The Lion King and was meant to be a sort of North American version of that blockbuster. Eventually it was retooled into a story not dissimilar from The Emperor’s New Groove where someone is turned into an animal in order to learn… something. This one is less comedic than that movie and is meant to be more of an earnest look at a handful of Inuit characters and their connection to the spirits and nature or whatever.\n\nCertain elements of Brother Bear work pretty well. The animators clearly did their homework and put together some decent landscapes and made some animals that look pretty good. They also employed a trick where they had the film play out in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first half hour or so and then expand out to a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio once our hero turns into a bear and the film also takes on a brighter more storybook like color scheme when this happens. That’s an idea that displays some visual creativity, but I’m not sure this was the greatest idea given that the first half isn’t exactly a claustrophobic experience and replicating this on a TV, even in the era of big widescreen televisions is kind of tough. There’s some of the usual annoying comic relief here including a bizarre reunion of the Strange Brew guys to voice a pair of moose who talk with stereotypical Canadian accents and a little bear cub voiced by one of the kids from The Bernie Mac show who I’m pretty sure is supposed to be annoying in a funny kind of way but who is mostly just annoying. The film has also musically resorted back to getting Phil Collins songs in order to recapture the “magic” of Tarzan but it works even less here and the decision just kind of screams of laziness.\n\nWhere the movie starts to lose me is probably in its wishy washy message in which the main character is judged for having gone after the bear that sort of caused the death of his father and by becoming a bear himself he sees the animals’ side of what hunting feels like. This sort of works if you take it as a very general fable about the ways that people misunderstand each other and the problems with acting out of anger and out of the desire for revenge, but taken at face value it’s kind of silly. This is a post-ice age Inuit community, in that society sometimes you’re going to have to kill some bears and sitting back and thinking about how the bear would feel about in some fantasy environment where bears have human-like intelligence and personality is childish silliness. In general though, this movie isn’t really half bad. I get why it had a hard time competing with the likes of Finding Nemo that year but if it had come out in a time when Disney was better positioned to market it and people were more interested in movies like this it might be better remembered. As it was the thing just kind of came and went. I don’t think it lost any money and given that Disney seemed about ready to just write the thing off as a loss they probably thought they gotten away with something.\n\nHome on the Range (2004)\n\nI remember back in 2004 looking at an article on the internet which was laying out all the potential nominees for the then still new Best Animated Feature Category. It listed each movie like The Incredibles and Shrek 2 and included a blurb outline the pros and cons of each film earning a nomination and then way down at the bottom of the list was an entry for the movie Home on the Range with a caption that simply read something like “Disney needs to rethink its animation division.” That’s how much of a non-entity this thing was in 2004, it barely even registered and when it did it was little more than an emblem of Disney’s irrelevance. Today it has, bar none, the worst reputation of any movie that Disney ever made and in some ways it almost feels like an act of self-sabotage; an attempt to force their 2D animation division to hit rock bottom just so no one would miss it when it was gone. I’d like to think that, it certainly fits the narrative, but there’s one bit of evidence that suggests that isn’t the case: this damn thing cost $100 million dollars to make. That’s over twice the cost of Brother Bear and even a little more than the cost of The Incredibles. I don’t know how this can possibly be true, it may have been partially due to a reworking not dissimilar to what happened to The Emperor’s New Groove, but still, there’s no way a major corporation sinks that kind of cash into a movie unless they do believe in it on some level.\n\nGoing into the movie I had nearly subterranean expectations and that probably did effect the experience a little because as I was watching it I came to realize that the movie wasn’t really “bad” so much as it was wildly misbegotten. It’s really unambitious, it doesn’t feel like Disney at all really, and it also doesn’t feel like a big budget movie made in the 21st Century, but it isn’t necessarily a failure at what it set out to do. The film is trying to be a send-off of westerns but told from the perspective of the animals, specifically a trio of cows voiced by Roseanne Barr, Judi Dench, and Jennifer Tilly… because the only thing modern kids like more than westerns is Rosanne. The plot is this insane thing where cows, actual quadrupedal cows, try to hunt down an infamous bandit to collect a bounty that will save their homestead. Again, this is a movie about motherfucking cows saving the day. The film’s animation is also… I don’t want to say dated because in part I think it was intentionally retro, but it certainly didn’t have that Disney look that people are looking for from this studio. In fact, if you had told me that this was a Disney Channel special from 1995 rather than a theatrical release I probably would have believed it give or take a few celebrity voice actors and a CG show or two. But still, there are aspects of the movie that are a little… cute, I guess. It’s not a movie that overwhelms you with badness, it’s just a thing that should not be coming from who it’s coming from and when it came from. I’m sure if you showed it to a very small child they’ll enjoy it but I also don’t really know why anyone who’s not doing a Disney retrospective will have watched the damn thing in the last ten years.\n\nChicken Little (2005)\n\nBy 2005 Disney Animation was clearly in deep shit. They’d made three straight movies which were more or less considered embarrassments and hadn’t made a single movie that really captured the public’s interest in any kind of big ways in the 21st Century. So finally they decided their only recourse was to ditch traditional animation and begin trying to compete with the Pixars and Dreamworkses in the CGI arena and began assembling a team dedicated to that format. I’m pretty sure they knew that there would be some awkward growing pains along the way and that they didn’t want to waste their best ideas and concepts on this novice team so their first few forays into the medium were a bit… odd. It would, however, be a mistake to assume that Disney was ready and willing to just take a loss on the project. On the contrary there was actually a lot of pressure on the movie to perform at the box office because, at this point, Disney was in the middle of some rather heated negotiations with Pixar. Pixar’s distribution deal with Disney was about to run out in 2006 and it was an open question as to what the future of that relationship would be. Both Disney and Pixar wanted the two to merge but they would have to settle on terms and the success or failure of Disney’s first CGI movie would say a lot about how much they needed Pixar and give one side or the other leverage.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out about Chicken Little is how awful its animation is. Now granted, it can be a little tough in 2017 to gauge the extent to which the awfulness of this CGI is just a fuction of the era it comes from, but comparing this to the trailer for The Incredibles (a movie which reportedly cost $50 million less to make) the difference is stark. The character designs here are all really ugly and the world of the movie doesn’t cohere very well at all. Obviously this is a modernized take on the Chicken Little story but it also seems to completely misunderstand that fable as well. In the film Chicken Little gets in trouble because he thinks the sky is falling and no one believes him. Then it turns out that, while the sky isn’t actually falling, reflective pieces of alien spaceships are falling and no one is believing his warnings because his initial claims seemed to be false. That is the opposite of what happens in the original story, the whole point of the Chicken Little story is supposed to be that the title character’s warnings are ridiculous and they lead the fools who follow him to ruin: the moral is supposed to be that not everything you hear is true and that you need to exert some critical thinking lest you get caught up in a panicking mob. This initially seemed like it was replacing that with a “boy who cried wolf” scenario, but that doesn’t really fit either given that Chicken Little turned out to be right from the very beginning.\n\nInstead the moral of this movie is some bullshit about the kid reuniting with his father, who has not been terribly supportive. I can’t say I cared all that much and the movie uses some of the most contrived silliness in order to force these people to deal with one another. The movie is constantly begging Chicken Little to talk to this shitty father to solve these problems but never seems to accept the possibility that he could maybe go to some other adult authority figure with his problems or maybe have one of his friends go to one of their parents. One could say this is just a movie for kids, but what kind of message does this thing send to that audience? That if they make one mistake the whole world including their parents will be incredibly cruel to them for the rest of their lives and that the only way out of this hell is to redeem yourself in a major way? That would just create some neurotic kids. Oh and did I mention that the comedy in this is truly awful? Basically nothing in this movie works. It might not have the awful reputation of Home on the Range simply because no one remembers it but it’s noticeably worse. In fact it’s the worst thing Disney has ever made and by a wide margin. But here’s the real kicker: despite this being a truly inept and horrid movie it still made bank. In fact it gave Disney its best opening weekend since The Lion King before making over a hundred million and becoming the fourteenth highest grossing movie of its year. I don’t know how to explain that except that sometimes family movies can make a lot more than they deserve simply by virtue of opening on the right date sometimes, especially in 2005, a year that didn’t have a Pixar movie but did see a whole lot of garbage like Robots and Hoodwinked make respectable box office.\n\nMeet the Robinsons (2007)\n\nDisney Animation Studios didn’t release a single movie in 2006, making it the first year since 1993 to be entirely without a Disney movie but things were hardly uneventful for them. In 2005 Michael Eisner stepped down from his position and named Bob Iger as his successor and finished negotiations with Steve Jobs to acquire Pixar. As part of this merger John Lasseter was named as Chief Creative Officer of both Pixar and Disney Animation and with Disney Animation being the squeaky wheel he immediately set out to fix it and bring it back to its former glory. While all this was going on Disney did have a film in production while Lasseter wasn’t there for its inception he did have some input on it apparently and gave notes to a rough cut of the movie which resulted in 60% of the movie being scrapped and re-tooled. That movie is called Meet the Robinsons and it is decidedly not Disney’s most famous movie. Seriously thing just came and went real fast and hardly generated any kind of buzz. I sort of remember there being some talk about the fact that it was released in impressiveish 3D (despite Avatar getting a lot of the credit for the 3D craze Hollywood was definitely working towards 3D before) but that was about it, prior to this viewing I didn’t even know what the movie was about outside of its blurb on the Netflix mailer I got and its characters and imagery are hardly iconic.\n\nFor all its flaws, Meet the Robinsons is definitely a huge leap forward from Chicken Little. The animation here is competent, it’s not mind blowingly great or anything but it does seem to be up to the same standards as their competitors and it has a better grasp of basic film grammar that that earlier effort lacked. I still think there are design elements here that don’t really work. They seem to have taken a lot of visual inspiration from old television cartoons like “The Jetsons” and especially “Rocky and Bullwinkle,” specifically the “Peabody and Sherman” shorts from the later and the film’s villain bears a bit of a resemblance to Snidely Whiplash. I didn’t particularly care for the look of the main character and the actual “Robinsons” also just seem like a strange assortment of weirdness without much of a rhyme or reason. Still, it’s mostly progress on the visual front. Narratively, not so much. The movie’s key flaw is that its protagonist is really annoying. This kid is completely out of control and just does the stupidest things to make things harder for all involved and a lot of the movie’s time travel logic does not hold up to scrutiny.\n\nThe movie’s other big problem is its preachiness. The message here is that you shouldn’t be discouraged by failure and should instead keep trying until you succeed at what you want to do. I know this is the film’s message because characters say exactly that out loud early in the film and repeat it often. The movie is not very subtle about this message and isn’t really confident enough to just let its story impart the message on its own and feels the need to really lay it out. That said, there could be a bit of a meta level to all this; a suggestion that Disney has failed a lot recently but that it’s going to pay off eventually. In fact I know this interpretation was intended because the movie straight up puts a title card at the end which more or less confirms this. Again, not a subtle movie. I don’t really think this movie is good enough to be the rebirth of Disney but it is a clear improvement, in fact it feels like this should have been Disney’s first CGI movie instead of the abomination that was Chicken Little (a movie that truly shouldn’t exist). Here’s the real kicker though: as much as this feels like a comeback of sorts for Disney it actually made less money than Chicken Little, which may be a function of how much that awful movie hurt their brand or may just be a quirk or when it was released and how it was marketed (that title probably didn’t help). John Lasseter still had a lot of work to do.\n\nBolt (2008)\n\nThey say that reputations are hard won but easily lost and by 2008 Disney was getting a hard lesson in this. In the time that they were floundering Pixar had unquestionably taken their crown as the king of feature length animation while Dreamworks and arguably a couple of other studios had also lapped them. They had been making some steps to get themselves back in the game but these had widely gone ignored by the film community, who were consumed with love for Pixar, who were at the peak of their talents in the late 2000s. I certainly remember Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons being almost entirely ignored by everyone except for parents of small children, but by the time their 2008 film Bolt came out I did at least hear some rumblings that Disney were making something of a comeback. These rumblings were faint and were almost entirely overshadowed by the overwhelming critical support for Pixar’s Wall-E, but they were there. Much of this credit was applied to John Lasseter, who had just come on board after the merger and who had more extensive influence over this than he did with Meet the Robinsons. This apparent respectability certainly came as a bit of a surprise to any outside observers who wasn’t familiar with the personnel changes at Disney.\n\nThe thing certainly looked pretty lame from its concept and advertising as it looked like it was about some kind of dog superhero or something. As it turns out the movie is actually about a dog (voiced by John Travolta) that merely thinks he’s a superhero because he stars on a stange looking TV show along with his child actress owner (voiced by Miley Cyrus back when she was still a Disney employee and not someone who made a point of swinging naked on wrecking balls) and goes on a cross country adventure with a gangster cat and a wacky hamster to return to her. This is probably where the John Lasseter influence becomes a little more clear as this plot bears more than a striking resemblance to Lasseter’s breakthrough film Toy Story what with the plot revolving around an underclass of people who exist to please human children, one of whom isn’t in on this and thinks he’s an action hero like Buzz Lightyear did. There are enough difference here to keep the movie from looking like a total rip-off, but the similarities are noticeable. The plot is also a little formulaic in general, and anyone over six is probably going to be able to guess pretty early on how this is going to play out and what lessons are going to be learned by the end, but moment to moment it does play out with confidence and avoids some of those cringey moments as much as it can.\n\nThe animation in the film is quite good, a clear step up from Meet the Robinsons and a giant leap over Chicken Little. The movie is almost a decade old now and does show its age a little and it doesn’t have quite the “wow” factor of something like Wall-E but in general it’s definitely up to the standards of the competition of the time. What the movie didn’t have so much was much of a real Disney Animation feel, though one wonders what exactly that even meant in 2008. Back in the day a movie like Lady and the Tramp or The Jungle Book could be said to have a “Disney feel” because of their animation style (and the fact that they were the only ones in the game making animated features on this scale), but that style doesn’t really carry over to the CGI era and as such they kind of just felt like one more studio making movies about talking CGI animals. Without Princesses and the like there really wasn’t a lot there to make movies like this jump out and scream “Disney’s back bitches!” and get people excited again and start looking at these movies as events.\n\nThe Princess and the Frog (2009)\n\nBy 2008 Disney was pretty much back in action, they’d brought in new management vis-à-vis the acquisition of Pixar and they’d built up a CGI animation department that could compete with the big boys. For all intents and purposes they were once again a modern and formidable animation studio but there’s one thing they still hadn’t gotten back: class. Meet The Robinsons and Bolt didn’t feel like Disney movies, they just felt like movies that were competing with the pack. To really officially be worthy of that “when you wish upon a star” fanfare over the Disney logo they’d need to recapture that “magic” and prove that they could once again adapt fairy tales and create a new “princess.” They did have a CGI version of this in the works, but before they could pull the trigger on that they’d have to experiment and the way they decided to do that was by going old-school and make another 2D hand drawn animated movie that would try to do everything it possibly could to replicate that Disney Renaissance feel and see if 2D really died because audiences weren’t interested anymore or if those movies from the early 2000s actually would have succeeded if they had someone like John Lasseter guiding them. The movie they decided to do this with was an adaptation of “The Frog Prince” relocated to 1920s New Orleans and with Disney’s first African-American Princess.\n\nThe Princess and the Frog is partially a “princess/fairy tale” movie but also something of a talking animal movie as much of the plot has our heroine and her prince transformed into frogs and trying to escape the bayou alongside a Cajun firefly and an alligator who resembles Louis Armstrong (in case you haven’t guessed, the movie is unapologetic in featuring a litany of Nola stereotypes which checks off everything from voodoo to Mardi Gras). On a basic storytelling level it isn’t exactly the most original movie that Disney ever made, but it isn’t really trying to be. Instead it’s like the animation equivalent of something like The Artist or The Good German which intentionally tries to reverse-engineer an earlier filmmaking style right down to the formulaic plot, but the difference is that this isn’t trying to replicate something from decades past but something that was relatively recent though perhaps not so recent to the film’s target market. The movie is not half bad in its ability to check off some of the hallmarks of Disney old. That aforementioned jazz-man/alligator is not nearly as annoying as he could have been and the movie’s cackling villain, a voodoo man called Dr. Facilier, is a lot of fun in no small part because some genius decided to cast Keith David as his voice actor. The movie is also the first true “bursting into song” musical since Mulan, and while Alan Menken was busy working on their next movie Tangled they brought in frequent Pixar composer Randy Newman to do the music here, which makes sense given his knowledge of American roots music and of composing for family movies. I don’t know that any of the songs here are stone cold classics but they work well and the movie finds some creative ways to present them.\n\nIf there’s anything wrong with The Princess and the Frog it’s that it feels a bit calculated and inorganic, which can be said about a lot of Disney and Pixar films but especially this one given how hard it’s trying to be a very particular kind of Disney movie of yore. The film also feels a bit sanitized. This is, after all, a movie about an African American woman living in the 1920s and yet there isn’t even the slightest hint of racism in the air and everyone seems to be living in perfect harmony. Granted, New Orleans has a slightly more complex relation to the rest of the South when it comes to racial mixing but the portrait the movie paints is inauthentic. I suppose I can see why the movie wouldn’t want to force the realities of segregation on children but they maybe could have solved this by cutting the white characters out altogether rather than making them in to happy people devoid of prejudice. That’s not a huge problem though, and for the most part the film is actually quite successful at recapturing what made some of those earlier movies work while adding some unique touches of their own and made a movie that fits pretty well into their overall cannon.\n\nSo why didn’t they follow this up with more new 2D animated movies? Well, it’s not that the movie bombed exactly, it made $250 million on a $100 million budget which wasn’t too far off from the profit margins of movies like Bolt, but it didn’t really generate the attention and buzz that would have dissuaded the corporate suits who were probably skeptical about John Lasseter’s little experiment in the first place. Of course the movie had certain disadvantages holding it back, for one thing it’s been speculated that having “princess” in the title scared away a lot of the boy market, which is the reason their next princess movies would be called Tangledand Frozen rather than “Rapunzel” and “The Ice Princess” respectively. The bigger problem though was probably that the damn thing came out five days before the release of James Cameron’s mega-blockbuster Avatar which proceeded to dominate the market and the conversation. Critics weren’t much help either. Most gave it respectful notes but it was largely viewed as a curio rather than the triumphant comeback Disney might have hoped for. 2009 was the year of Up, Coraline, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Where the Wild Things Are, which were all very critic friendly family movies and in that environment something like The Princess and the Frog didn’t feel like the refreshing breath of fresh air worth championing that it might have in other years. In general I think the movie might just have ironically been just a bit ahead of its time; the peak of 90s nostalgia and by extension Disney Renaissance nostalgia was still a couple of years away. That’s too bad because I do think Disney 2D animation is a tradition worth keeping alive and that they might have given up on a little too easily. That said, Lasseter did manage to use his clout to make it so Home on the Range would no longer be Disney’s final traditionally animated film, and that alone probably makes the whole endeavor worth it.\n\nTo the Present\n\nAnd that brings us up to the present and to the Disney movies that I’ve already seen and analyzed either in my usual film criticism routines or in previous family movie retrospectives. However, given that Disneyology is as much a history of the Disney company as it is a look at the movies themselves I do think I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least touch on what Disney has done since the 2010s began. Times have been good for Disney and they’re in the middle of what they’ve been calling the “Disney Revival” but which might perhaps be better dubbed the “Disney Enlightenment” given both that the historical Enlightenment came after the Renaissance and that general “wokeness” is something of a running theme in what they’ve been doing lately. Disney’s recent output can be divided into two camps: movies that continue their tradition of adapting fairy tales and more experimental movies that are trying to compete with the wider world of animated movies and which generally tend to target the interests of the young boy demographic.\n\nIn the latter camp they started with a movie called Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) which was meant to be about the inner working of a universe of videogames. That movie fell well into “nice try” territory and had some cute moments, but was neither a particularly authentic look at the world of video games (it’s slander of Zangief will not be forgotten) not a terribly original adventure unto itself and the moral at its center was rather muddled. Their next attempt at a standalone title looked at another interest of modern little boys: Superheroes. That movie, Big Hero 6 (2014), took an obscure title from the now Disney owned Marvel catalog and turned it into a big CGI extravaganza. It was a fun movie and it looked really good, but it had some weak side characters and ultimately didn’t prove to be the most memorable of movies once you got some distance from it. The most recent movie down this lineage was Zootopia (2016), which was less obviously pandering towards little boys than the aforementioned movies but it is ultimately telling a cop story. That was possibly the movie overtly political movie that Disney has ever made and more or less exists to provide an imperfect but age appropriate allegory to teach kids modern ideas about how intolerance works and how diverse people can co-exist.\n\nOf course where Disney really makes their money is off the princesses and they’ve certainly served that crowed in abundance as of late. They first brought the princess thing into the third dimension with Tangled (2010), which adapted the Rapunzel story into almost an action story. It had the usual combo of scheming villains, musical sequences, and the like but it leaned into some rather lame comedy a bit too much and ultimately just didn’t prove to really be much of a meaningful twist on the genre otherwise. In retrospect that movie proved to be something of a warm-up (no pun intended) for what is by far their most popular movie since their Renaissance heyday: Frozen (2013). That is in many ways a movie that probably doesn’t need an introduction but in its adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson’s “The Ice Princess” it added some interesting twists like having two bickering sibling princesses instead of one and is particularly notable for having some particularly strong music. I thought that Frozen was only about half of the step forward it portrayed itself as and that its first half was a lot stronger than its second half, but it nonetheless was a clear win for them and left little remaining doubt that Disney was back to being the dominant animation studio, especially given that Pixar was having kind of a rough time at this point. Disney’s most recent princess was brought to us in the film Moana (2016), which followed the usual formula pretty closely but did it with gusto and differentiated itself by being set in the world of Polynesian folklore and followed its predecessor’s lead and upped its musical credentials.\n\nSo, Disney Animation seems to be in quite a place of strength right now, but if the history I’ve gone through for the last two years has taught me anything it’s that “happily ever after” has always proved to be something of an illusion for this studio and that no matter how strong they get the pendulum always swings the other way eventually. I don’t know when that will happen for this current incarnation of Disney Animation but they need only look towards their sister studio Pixar’s recent slide into relative mediocrity to see how things can go wrong. Pixar in many ways actually seems to be something of a victim of Disney’s success, it rested on its laurels while Disney was the squeaky wheel getting all the grease and they suffered because of it. Apparently there’s only so much John Lasseter to go around. What’s more, there are some disconcerting signs on the horizon. The studio’s next two films are both sequels: Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-it-Ralph 2 and Frozen 2. These will be the first theatrical sequels that Disney will have made since The Rescuers Down Under which was until now their only attempt at doing one. It’s really kind of extraordinary that this bastion of cinematic capitalism has avoided Hollywood’s obsession with sequels as long as it did, but it’s happening, and as such they won’t have another original film until their Jack and the Beanstalk adaptation Giganticcomes out. Lasseter has proven that he’s capable of guiding respectable sequels over the years, but if they’re not careful they’re going to end up making the same mistake that Pixar did.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nSo I’ve now more or less seen every single fully animated Disney movie since the studio’s inception in 1937. Was it worth it? Well, I’d say my thoughts are largely mixed. I saw some good movies, I saw some bad movies, I saw some ugly movies. I saw a studio go from hand drawn animation to xerography, to various forms of computer animation, to mounting fully CGI productions. I’ve seen them rise and fall, rise again, fall again, and rise yet again. In many ways I think the overall narrative of the studio’s history kind of took over the whole column in a way that I didn’t expect it to and this overshadowed a lot of the actual movies, but that may simply be a reflection of what ended up interesting me the most about the movies. I certainly appreciated their older movies simply for their animation quality, but I’ve got to say, looking back at how simple some of the narratives have historically been in these Disney movies may have had the net effect of giving me a much greater appreciation for how much Pixar did to raise the bar on storytelling in animation. I can pine for the golden age of hand drawn animation all I want but if I’m given a binary choice I’m kind of glad they don’t make them like they used to.\n\nBeyond that the various “eras” of Disney largely played out the way most people said they did. There were certainly individual movies that I break with consensus on (like Peter Pan and 101 Dalmatians) but for the most part the movies that are considered “classics” have stood the test of time for a reason. Disney really was at its best during the “golden age” and during the “Renaissance” and is on a bit of a roll right now, and when they were bad it was usually pretty apparent. I’d be lying if I said doing the last couple of eras wasn’t a bit of a chore. It’s not so much that the movies they made between 2000 and 2009 were awful movies per se, in fact I liked some of them more than most, it’s just that they put out a lot of uninspired movies that no one cares about and which I didn’t have much to say about. On the upside I feel like there are going to be a lot of pop culture references that will make more sense to me and I’ll be a lot more prepared to look at the studio going forward, especially as they make pointless live action remakes of all these movies. Could all this time have been better used? Probably, but I made my choice and I’m glad I saw it through.\n\nThree installments ago I looked at Disney during the period between 1977 and 1988, which has dubbed the “Disney Dark Age” which set the studio up for its famous Renaissance during the 1990s. In retrospect that was far from being Disney’s low point given the bad place they would find themselves in during the 2000s. During this era Disney had seemingly no idea what they wanted to be after the Disney Renaissance, and unlike in the 80s when their only competitor in the world of theatrical animation was Don Bluth and the occasional movie based on a Saturday morning cartoon, there were major players in the 2000s that were more than willing to fill the void that Disney was leaving. Pixar was obviously in ascendance in the late 90s and began out grossing their older cousins at Disney pretty much out of the gate and by the 2000s they were pretty indisputably the more relevant and profitable studio. At least in the case of Pixar the broader Disney Corporation profited from that competitor’s success, but the rise of Dreamworks and other offshoots like Fox Animation and Sony Animation were much more existential threats. In part, Disney was becoming a victim of their own success. Movies like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast had proven that there was major money to be made from animated features and the pie had become big enough that other studios had realized that they could get a piece of it and made investments accordingly that were beginning to come to fruition. Still, Disney being the cultural institution that it was made it a bit too big to fail and they continued to churn out movies at a pretty steady pace as they struggled to find a new identity. In fact they were actually putting out more product than ever. In nine years I have left to cover they put out no fewer than twelve different movies under the Disney Animation Studios umbrella and for this installment I’ll be looking at the first six, three of which actually came out during their jam packed year 2000.\n\nFantasia 2000 (2000)\n\nIn the year 2000 Disney put out three movies; one was meant as a continuation of what they were doing in the 90s, one was a wacky experiment, and one was a labor of love harkening back to the studio’s earliest days which probably wasn’t really meant to be an overly commercial project. The first of these films to be released was that third one: a follow-up to Disney’s 1940 classic Fantasia. Fantasia 2000 is generally believed to be the pet project of Walt Disney nephew and Disney board member Roy Disney. The idea was rooted in the fact that Walt Disney had always envisioned Fantasia as a sort of living document, one that would be re-released frequently with some segments dropped and new ones added and would be a sort of platform for an endless supply of classical music themed animated shorts. When the original film underperformed in its original release that plan was scuttled and some of the follow-up shorts were re-purposed for other short-compilation films. In the 80s Roy Disney got the idea to pick up on Walt’s original plan and make a follow-up Fantasia but as you may recall the Disney company was mired in turmoil during that decade and was in no position to throw millions at a project that would have major commercial hurdles and probably wouldn’t sell too many toys. But by the 90s when the Disney Renaissance was in full swing they finally had some leeway to take some risk and Roy Disney’s dream of bringing Fantasia back to the big screen could finally be realized.\n\nIf I were to describe my feelings about Fantasia 2000 briefly it would probably be “It’s cool that they made this and the best parts make it worth it, but they definitely made some pretty big mistakes along the way.” Let’s start with the positive. The best segment in the film is actually the one that least closely resembles the style of the original: a love letter to New York in the style of famous caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” It doesn’t look like classic Disney at all but it was an inspired style to use to bring Gershwin’s jazz-classic fusion classic to life and the various narratives they string through the short were enjoyable to follow. The other highlight is probably the final segment: a war between an earth spirit and a giant phoenix set to Stravinsky’s “Firebird suite.” The narrative through line in that short seems a little random and go goes contrary to what phoenixes are generally supposed to represent but the general epicness of the visuals makes up for this and it serves decently enough as a companion to the “Night on Bald Mountain scene” from the original that this is almost certainly trying to evoke. The Donald Duck/Noah’s Ark/”Pomp and Circumstance” segment also mostly works and it was cool that they got the idea to pull a “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” with another one of the characters from the Mickey Mouse universe, although Pomp and Circumstance seems like kind of an odd music choice given that it’s so heavily associated with graduation ceremonies.\n\nSpeaking of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”… it’s also in the movie, unaltered from its original form and in its entirety. I guess if I were seeing this thing in a theater in 2000 this might have been a nice little added treat but given that this is a 75 minute movie it’s hard not to view it as just being a time filler they through in. The “Carnival of Animals” sequence also kind of has the whiff of padding. It’s well animated and cute but it’s really short and doesn’t really leave much of an impression and almost feels unfinished in some ways. Another segment that doesn’t work so well, at least to my eyes today, is the “Pines of Rome” sequence in which a pack of whales starts flying out of the water and into space or something. I can kind of see why it might have looked cool in the 2000s but it’s weird and the CGI used to animate it has not aged all that well. Frankly it kind of looked like it could have been a companion to those coca cola commercials with the polar bears. Questionable CGI also mars the “Steadfast Tin Soldier” segment in which a toy soldier faces off against an evil Jack-In-The-Box, although that one did have other elements that redeemed it pretty well, particularly a brief portion in the sewers with these cool looking rats.\n\nSomething kind of odd about the movie as a whole is that a lot of the classical music pieces they chose are a little less famous than the ones chosen for the first film. That original movie feels almost like a greatest hits of legendary orchestral pieces. There are some famous pieces here too like “Rhapsody in Blue” and “Pomp and Circumstance” but a lot of them use deeper cuts from composers like Dmitri Shostakovich and Ottorino Respighi which I (in my relative ignorance of classical music) was not terribly familiar with. That might not have been as much of a problem with some good introductions to give context… which brings me to my biggest gripe: the live action intros in this thing are dogshit. The original Fantasia had this really classy presentation where you were invited to imagine yourself as an attendee at a high class orchestral show with a world famous conductor and a well-known classical music expert giving you introductions. Here they’ve replaced that with a series of hacky intros by various celebrities like Steve Martin and Penn & Teller that completely kill the mood. I realize that seems like a goofy thing to dock points for, the shorts are the real meat of the project after all, but they have the effect of cheapening things and kind of put into perspective how important the framing was to the original movie.\n\nSo overall Fantasia 2000 is a bit of a mixed bag but for whatever faults it has I just can’t be too mad at it if only because it just feels like such neat thing for a major studio to be throwing money at and it just feels like a pretty noble attempt. Michael Eisner is reported to have called it “Roy’s folly” and the company in general seems to have known going in that it was going to be more of a goodwill project than a potential blockbuster, the equivalent of a normal studio funding some auteur’s pet project in hopes of winning an Oscar. To their credit the marketers did come up with a fairly clever use for the film: rather than giving it a wide release they instead toured it to IMAX theaters, which at this time were still at that stage where they were almost entirely being used to show science and nature documentaries rather than “real movies.” This was a good way to make the film look like an investment in future distribution models rather than an indulgent money pit and was also kind of in keeping with Walt Disney’s original vision of Fantasia as a film that would tour the country and show off new theatrical technology. Between the IMAX release and an eventual wide release the film was able to eke out a $90 million gross worldwide, which would seem to cover its $80 million dollar budget, which is a low profit by Disney standards but was probably a better outcome than Eisner originally envisioned. There hasn’t been another Fantasia since the release of Fantasia 2000 (unless you want to count that weird Xbox Kinect game) but I do think there’s room for one. Disney is on another upswing and golden ages at that company do usually come packaged with Fantasia movies and it would be interesting to see what one would look like done entirely with the computer animation of today.\n\nDinosaur (2000)\n\nIf you ask John Lasseter he’d tell you that using computer animation had very little to do with the success of Pixar and that the main reason for their success was simply that they told quality stories. There’s some truth to that, Pixar certainly wouldn’t have had anywhere near the success it had without quality storytelling, but the fact that they were working in a different animation medium than Disney was essential to their success. During the late 90s there was something of a gold rush to see what studios could get in on the fortune that Renaissance era Disney had proved that animated movies could earn. Many of these studios did this by making traditionally animated movies and while a couple of good movies like The Iron Giant were made because of this most of them were lame me-too ripoffs of what Disney was doing like The Road to El Dorado, Anastasia, and Quest for Camelot. The fact that Pixar was working in a completely different format from Disney made them stand out and compete in a more indirect manner. Additionally it allowed Disney (a company that tends to throw money at their problems) to view Pixar as a partner and potential future acquisition rather than as a competitor. Presumably Disney thought that traditional animation and computer animation were going to co-exist for the a long time and that the two companies would be the industry leaders in these two different mediums and could simply co-exist, but they did remain two separate companies and Disney could not afford to have all their eggs in the Pixar basket when it came to computer animation.\n\nOne of their backup plans was a company called Dream Quest Images which Disney bought and renamed The Secret Lab. Dream Quest had actually been a visual effects company that had done some cutting edge CGI work for movies like Total Recall and The Abyss before they were bought by Disney in 1996 with the intention that they could essentially make a movie that consisted entirely of the CGI they were using for special effects. The one feature film they made was an oddity called Dinosaur, which only bore the Disney logo when it was released and seems to have been accepted into the Disney canon despite not fitting in with the rest of their films very well at all. The film was actually made using a unique technique, one which doesn’t really seem to have been used elsewhere, where they actually used live action nature footage and used that as their backgrounds and then added in all the talking dinosaurs over it.
