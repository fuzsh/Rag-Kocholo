        "text": "PaRDeS and FilmInterpretationMultiple Levels of Cinematic MeaningVickyJohann SchinkelSubmitted in total fulfilment of the requirementsOf the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyAugust 2012School of Historical and Philosophical StudiesThe University of Melbourne iABSTRACTThis thesis establishes the traditional Jewish interpretative model PaRDeS as the foundation of a new film interpretation method, and suggests a PaRDeS interpretative process that can be used as a guide by other analysts, critics and scholars. PaRDeS is a sophisticated method of analysis that reflects millennia of Judaic explorations of narrative structures, stories, interpretations and commentaries. Maimonides’ blending of Aristotelian and Jewish philosophy led to the development of different kinds of interpretative frameworks, including PaRDeS. PaRDeS is a map of meaning that articulates Jewish philosophy and reflects a Jewish history of emphasising the importance of interpretation.PaRDeS interpretation encourages dialogues about cinema, and the meaning of films. The PaRDeS method responds to other film analyses in its own interpretative mission to coordinate and integrate multiple levels of meaning. Using PaRDeS in this original way to interpret contemporary films is significant to both Jewish Studies and Film Studies. This thesis extends the investigations of contemporary uses of PaRDeS in Jewish Studies and introduces the method to Film Studies, responding to existing issues of film interpretation in doing so. A multi-level framework of different kinds of meaning differentiates PaRDeS from its contemporary counterparts, and from a tradition of film interpretation that narrows the scope of interpretative interest to ideological perspectives.The originality of the PaRDeS conceptualisation of film meaning, the unique assumptions of the model, and its coordination and synthesis of different interpretative strategies differentiates PaRDeS from contemporary critical perspectives. PaRDeS film interpretation develops important insights about film meaning, and describes specific ways cinema reflects the world that creates and interprets films. Since this is the first time the PaRDeS method has been used to produce formal interpretations of films, there is as yet no established process for doing so. This thesis develops a PaRDeS model of interpretation (Chapter Two) and uses it to generate new insights during the various investigations of different elements of film in the chapters that follow. PaRDeS has never been adapted for use as a modern tool of cinematic investigation before now, and this thesis is necessarily exploratory in its evolution of a new PaRDeS approach to film interpretation. The PaRDeS method is developed in various multi-level interpretations of the following films: The Matrix (Larry and Andy Wachowski, 1999), Clueless (Amy Heckerling, 1995), Josie and the Pussycats (Harry Elfont & Deborah Kaplan, 2001), Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976), and Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010).\n\nThis course is an introduction to the basic concepts of film analysis and topics in film studies. It operates on the premise that before you can explore more complex facets of film studies-such as advanced theory, criticism, and history-you must first develop expertise in analyzing the basic elements of film form and style. We will devote several weeks to building a precise vocabulary to describe mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound in film with the goal that you will learn to trace the function of style and form within a scene and across a film. With these skills, you can enhance your everyday viewing of film, television, and streaming series; build upon this knowledge in subsequent film studies courses; and generally become a more discerning consumer and producer of visual discourse. We will work through the nuts and bolts of film analysis (the grammar of cinema); but we also will explore various modes of filmmaking and introductory critical methods, focusing in particular on how we categorize different films and what these categories mean. This class is meant to teach us ways of reading cinema, but it also builds upon critical thinking, critical reading, and critical writing skills-forms of interpretation and analysis that you can apply to other areas such as literature, the broader humanities, and popular culture.\n\nCognitive approaches to cinema comprise several proposals concerning the segmentation of the understanding of the flux of audiovisual stimuli in several conceptual domains. In this paper, we would like to develop a proposal for a cinematographic analysis inspired by the conceptual framework of cognitive linguistic approaches and neurosciences studies. The viewer / film critic can identify and delineate patterns describable as neurological processes or as phenomenological instantiations manifested in various conceptualization domains that can be isolated from other domains. The conceptualizations are determined by top-down schemas in various semantic domains, and by bottom-up cues on screen of semantic purport. The cinematic expressive structures that are formed with the help of cues allow the spectator to recognize and correct conceptual patterns within alternative conceptual domains. Cinematic expressions – diegetic mise-en-scene, frame composition, shot structure, and editing and stylistic patterns– are instantiations of construal, alternative manners of representing aspects of conceptual content. To the extent that a set of cues is predominately biased towards one domain or another, the viewer will categorize the conceptual content into one or more domains. The claim is that domains are like attractors that warp in a dynamic manner conceptual content towards a domain or another, and, as a consequence will warp and modulate other domains. Cues are not static clues, but represent procedural algorithms that the viewer puts into action in order to gain access to conceptual content. The domains analyzed are the prefigurative, the figurative, the diegetic, the symbolic, the narrative, the conceptualizer, the affective, and the discursive. Describing various bounded conceptual regions of conceptual content sustained by cinematic experience is a description of the brains' projection of an interior living film staged in a \" Cartesian theatre \" devoid of a secondary conscious homunculus.\n\nCognitive approaches to cinema comprise several proposals concerning the segmentation of the understanding of the flux of audiovisual stimuli in several conceptual domains.

An overview of proposals for cinematic conceptual domains Cognitive approaches to cinema comprise several proposals concerning the dividing of the flow of audiovisual stimuli in several conceptual domains. The description and analysis of the audiovisual discourse invariably touches on some of those domains. Let us mention some of the recent approaches: 1. The Danish theoretician, Torben Grodal (1997: 57; 279), distinguishes between several neural processes that the cinemagoer undergoes, e.g. intense experience (the viewer's focus is oriented towards perceptual non-figurative processes), saturated experience (the focus is aimed at a figurative associative deaca@dnt.ro"
