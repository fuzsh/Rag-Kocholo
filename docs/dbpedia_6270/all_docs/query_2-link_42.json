        "text": "DreamWorks Animation is developing a couple of new animated series that will stream on Amazon. The first is based on the classic cartoon Rocky and Bullwinkle, which is called The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. We even already have a trailer for that series. The second show that's being developed is called Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, which is based on the popular film franchise.\n\nHere are all the details and the trailer for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle:\n\nThe world’s best-known flying squirrel and talking moose are back in a serialized comedy about the two goofball best friends who routinely find themselves thrust into harrowing situations but end up saving the day time and again. As Rocky (Tara Strong) and Bullwinkle’s (Brad Norman) innocent and silly ambitions to become rock stars or find lost treasure end up dovetailing with Fearless Leader’s (Piotr Michael) sinister plans to take over the world, our heroes are set on a collision course with his notorious superspies Boris Badenov (Ben Diskin) and Natasha Fatale (Rachel Butera)."
