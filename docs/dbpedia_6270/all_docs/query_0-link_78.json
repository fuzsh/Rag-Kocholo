        "text": "The summer movie season had started off so promisingly. ''Mission: Impossible 2'' racked up $91.8 million in American theaters on the long Memorial Day weekend, fueling a record-breaking $171 million holiday and causing swoons of ecstasy to ripple through the corporate corridors of major movie studios. After that, who knew what the rest of the summer of 2000 might bring? Perhaps there would be yet another bumper crop of $100 million movies, just like last summer. Some even predicted that the hot months would see not just one, but two or even three $200 million blockbusters.\n\nAnd then something happened.\n\nThe horizon darkened. The engine began to make a funny pinging sound. Slowly, silently, the air went out of the tires. And the summer movie season of 2000 began to sink into the doldrums -- at least compared with last year's.\n\nThere were very few outright financial disasters among the films released in the five weeks after Memorial Day, the biggest bomb being the animated ''Titan A.E.,'' which cost more than $85 million and is expected to bring in somewhere around a third of that, causing 20th Century Fox this week to close the Phoenix animation studio that created it. But even the movies that were opening well (''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ''Shaft,'' ''Me, Myself and Irene'') didn't seem to be clicking with audiences with quite the intensity that movies had exhibited in the summer of 1999.\n\nTake it weekend by weekend:\n\nOn Memorial Day, strong holdover business from the hits of May (''Gladiator'' and ''Dinosaur''), mixed with an explosive opening for Paramount's ''Mission: Impossible 2'' and very promising debuts for Disney's ''Shanghai Noon'' and DreamWorks' ''Road Trip,'' created a 29 percent increase from 1999's holiday box office, when ''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' was early in its lucrative run. The next weekend, June 2 to 4, when only one major Hollywood film opened, the Martin Lawrence comedy ''Big Momma's House,'' there was again an increase, 23 percent, from the 1999 figure for the same weekend.\n\nBut each of the next three weekends saw dramatically lower receipts than the parallel weekends of 1999. On the second weekend of June 1999, ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' earned $54.9 million. This year on that weekend, the Nicolas Cage action film ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' led the field with $25.3 million. On the third weekend of June last year, Disney's animated ''Tarzan'' was the leader with $34.2 million. This year it was ''Shaft,'' with $21.7 million. And last year on the fourth weekend in June, Adam Sandler's ''Big Daddy'' was in first place with $41.5 million. This year it was Jim Carrey in ''Me, Myself and Irene'' at $24.2 million.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the grosses for most of these films -- ''Shaft,'' for instance, showed much more strength on opening weekend than most had expected and has been holding up very well -- but as a group they are just not generating as much box-office heat as last year's crop.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
