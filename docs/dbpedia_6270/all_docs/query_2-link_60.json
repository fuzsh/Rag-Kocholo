        "text": "Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nBy FRANZ LIDZ\n\neep into the Eisenhower era of my youth, Donald was a sitting duck. My father and two of his brothers, lapsed and unlapsed socialists, used to lounge around our living room taking shots at Walt Disney.\n\nMy father: \"He's a capitalist!\"\n\nMy Uncle Danny: \"He's a fascist!\"\n\nMy Uncle Arthur: \"That's funny, I thought he was a cartoonist.\"\n\nIt is with great glee then that I recall a Saturday morning on the cusp of the Kennedy era when the four of us crumpled over in laughter at the appearance on the television screen of an animated prince with a cigarette-slim moustache. He looked deliciously like dear old Uncle Walt.\n\nPhil Caruso and ILM/ Universal Pictures Natasha (Rene Russo), Boris (Jason Alexander), Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) and the animated title characters in \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.\"\n\nWhile galloping through a forest, the prince had stumbled upon the castle of Sleeping Beauty. Withholding his magic kiss, he let her snooze and greedily envisioned franchise possibilities: \"I can see it now,\" he said in the patter of Sgt. Bilko selling a tank out of the motor pool. \"Sleeping Beauty comics!\"\n\nSleeping beauty hats! Sleeping Beauty bubble gum! And, biggest of all, Sleeping Beautyland. Though the amusement park opened boffo at the box office -- a Variety headline screamed: \"DOZE DOLL DUZ WIZ BIZ\" -- the mercantile prince didn't live happily ever after. His own dream was shattered by a pixie who demanded 50 percent of the gross.\n\nThis \"Fractured Fairy Tale\" was one of the many wicked satires from \"Rocky and His Friends,\" the smartest, dumbest, simplest and most complex cartoon ever made for television (and, yes, that includes \"The Simpsons\").\n\nOn June 30, Universal Pictures will resuscitate the flying squirrel and his pals on the big screen in \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,\" what studio flacks are calling a \"live-action/animated comedy.\"\n\nThe challenge facing the filmmakers is to give the three-dimensional actors (Robert De Niro, Rene Russo, Jason Alexander) as much depth as the two-dimensional drawings had.\n\nFrom its premiere on ABC in 1959 to its lamentable demise on NBC five years later (as \"The Bullwinkle Show\"), the show chronicled the adventures of a rodent named Rocky with a soft rasp of a voice, a goggled aviator cap and a penchant for collecting nuts: foremost, Bullwinkle, the walleyed, muddle-minded moose.\n\nAn alumnus of Wossamotta U. who had \"more brains in his little finger than he had in his whole head,\" Bullwinkle liked nothing better than to curl up in front of a fire with a pile of books (\"They burn so nice and slow.\")\n\nCrudely drawn, but sharply written, the cartoon was wacky with wincing wordplay -- \"airy persiflage,\" the ubiquitous narrator called it -- that flew faster than Rocky himself. The gifted voicers airing this persiflage (June Foray, Paul Frees and William Conrad, to name three) surrendered to every pun possible (a jewel-encrusted toy boat not only floated on Veronica Lake, but was called the \"Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam\") and impossible (\"For a powerful magnate,\" Rocky told a tycoon, \"you sure don't pick up things too quickly.\")\n\nThe punning even extended to come-ons for the next exciting episode: \"The Show Must Go On, or Give 'Em the Acts,\" \"All in Fever Say Aye, or the Emotion is Carried\" and \"Transatlantic Chicken, or Hens Across The Sea.\"\n\nIn the midst of all this punishment, Rocky and Bullwinkle battled mechanical metal-munching moon mice; discovered a rich lode of the antigravitational element, upsidaisium; and searched for the elusive Kerward Derby, which turned even the antlered Bullwinkle into a genius.\n\nBut their most enduring struggle was with Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, a couple of monumentally inept Slavic schemers from Pottsylvania. One of the pair's most fiendish plans involved thwarting a campaign to make Moosylvania the 51st state by disguising Butte, Mont., as Washington, D.C. Their plot got twisted, however, when it turned out that the nation's capitol had already been disguised as Butte by the Montana Musk Melon Trust.\n\nPopulated entirely by spies, secret agents and saboteurs, Pottsylvania was the one place where the Cold War never thawed. Its highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, The Pottsylvania Eavesdropper, was printed in invisible ink. The only place \"Rocky and His Friends\" was taken seriously was the Soviet Union, where it was deemed anti-Soviet propaganda.\n\nThe impresarios of this amusing agitprop were a left-leaning \"Mr. Magoo\" scriptwriter (Bill Scott) and a right-leaning Harvard MBA (Jay Ward). Rather than condescending to kids and teaching them Valuable Lessons, they enlisted them in a conspiracy against adulthood.\n\nThey were sort of premature yippies, smart alecks tweaking the military, the government, Eisenhower complacency, even network censors, who ignored the implicit racism of cooking Rocky and Bullwinkle in cannibal pots but blanched at the excessive cruelty. When the cannibal episode aired, Rocky trumped the censors by masking the cooking pot with a network memo that declared it inappropriate.\n\nLater, with Moose and Squirrel tied to a stake, the show's narrator breathlessly intoned: \"And the network-approved flames leaped higher and higher!\"\n\nRocky and his friends not only jawed with each other but with viewers as well.\n\nTo keep their audience, Bullwinkle once told kids at home to pull the knobs off their television sets so \"we'll be sure to be with you next week.\" Networks complained about that, too. Bullwinkle's response was to tell the kids in another installment: \"You can put the knobs back on now. Use glue -- and make it stick.\"\n\nBusting yet another cartoon convention, the characters were aware they were only comic inventions: Natasha spies Bullwinkle and exclaims, \"Boris, is moose you said you killed in previous episode!\"\n\n\"It's his show,\" Boris says, insouciantly. \"If he vants to be hard to kill, let him.\"\n\nIn the killing fields of 21st-century Hollywood, Rocky and Bullwinkle have been remade and remodeled with high-tech animation, their colors \"brightened\" to enhance merchandising potential. Wadded with cute cameos and topical wisecracks, the trailer for the $76 million \"Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" doesn't leave many hints of great promise.\n\nWill Loose Moose Do Wiz Biz? Tune in this summer for the next exciting episode: \"Building a Better Moosetrap, or Studio Squirrels Away Fortune.\""
