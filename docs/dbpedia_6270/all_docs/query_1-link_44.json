The nominal plot involves five vacationing college kids -- Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), and their classmates Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scott (Hal Delrich) and Shelly (Sarah York) -- making an unplanned stopover in an abandoned mountain cabin surrounded by impenetrable woods. Before settling in for the night, they come across an ancient-looking occult tome filled with dense hieroglyphics and macabre illustrations, a dagger fashioned from human bones, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The taped message, dictated by a professor of archaeology, describes the contents of the Sumerian \"Book of the Dead,\" filled with incantations used to bring otherworldly demons to life, giving them license to possess the living. The message goes on to explain that those possessed by these demons can only be stopped by total bodily dismemberment. When played among the group later that evening, the professor's recorded translations of the ritual chants traumatize the strangely prescient Shelly ... and simultaneously release an ominous presence from the depths of the forest. The evil spirits take to their dirty work with gusto, first assuming control of Shelly and transforming her into a cackling, murderous hag with superhuman strength; the others imprison her in the fruit cellar and chain the trapdoor shut. The spirits then begin to possess the other women, including Linda -- who immediately turns on Ash with a barrage of punches and sadistic taunts. Unable to bring himself to chop up his lover's corpse, Ash gives her a more customary burial in the woods -- which proves to be a big mistake. As the others succumb to demonic influence, Ash's horrific predicament becomes increasingly grim until, when all hope seems lost, he stumbles upon a final, desperate solution to the ghoulish onslaught ... well, maybe not. Despite the shoestring production values, Raimi has fashioned a tight, lightning-paced fever dream of a movie, filled with operatic overacting and outrageously gory effects that give the project a comic-book feel. Based on an earlier 8mm short titled Within the Woods, this feature version was fraught with distribution difficulties before finding its first audience overseas. After considerable word of mouth (and a glowing endorsement from horror author Stephen King), the film became a hit on home video, where it achieved further notoriety thanks to its highly-publicized banning in Britain amid the notorious \"Video Nasties\" censorship campaign. Raimi, along with producer Robert Tapert, writer Scott Spiegel and much of the same crew, cranked up the story's comic aspects several dozen notches for the rollicking semi-remake, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn. by Cavett Binion, Rovi Keywords: atrocity book cabin cellar chainsaw demon dismemberment gateway-to-hell monster demonic-possession rampage satanic Satanism slasher tree weekend woods [place] college-student invocation Themes: Zombies Demonic Possession Nightmare Vacations Curses and Spells Exclusive coverage Get Dragged to Hell With This Ultimate Sam Raimi Fan Quiz - Horror Hacker - AMCfrom AMC Blogs Inside the Unlikely Cult of Road House - AMC Movie Blog - AMCfrom AMC Blogs U.S. Marshals and Five Other Stealthy Movie Sequels - AMC Movie Blog - AMCfrom AMC Blogs ...ranks in these movie lists: Best Cars in Horror Movies (#8) Great Movies With Greater Monsters (#5) click here Currently 3/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Evil Dead [Film Series] The Exorcist (1973) Miller's Crossing (1990) The Omen (1976) Barwy Ochronne (1977) Donnie Darko (2001) Dead Alive (1992) Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) Re-Animator (1985) A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

O'Connor, Charlie Couture, Full Credits In the expatriate-littered Paris of the 1920s, painter Nick Hart (Keith Carradine) mingles with Ernest Hemingway (Kevin O'Connor) and other leading lights of the Lost Generation while palling around with gossip columnist Oiseau (Wallace Shawn), whose reportage has helped establish the international reputation of the writers and artists who fled America for France after WWI. Older and less successful than many of his fellow painters, Hart relies on gallery owner Libby Valentin (Genevieve Bujold) to sell what she can of his work while he supports himself drawing cartoons for Oiseau's weekly column. In a café one day, Hart spies Rachel Stone (Linda Fiorentino) on the arm of her husband, Bertram (John Lone), a condom magnate and art patron who's trying to buy his way into society. It seems Hart and Rachel share a romantic past of which Stone is completely unaware. At the salon of writers Gertrude Stein (Elsa Raven) and Alice B. Tolkas (Ali Giron), Hart suffers a nasty run-in with the Stones and meets Nathalie de Ville (Geraldine Chaplin), a rich socialite who wants to steal three paintings from her estranged husband. Nathalie plies Hart with sexual favors and the promise of cash in exchange for his help in forging copies of the paintings. Although he's loath to follow in the footsteps of his father, a gifted forger, Hart acquiesces, and soon his rivalry with Stone and his involvement with the forgeries leads to death, destruction, and scandal in the art world. Bujold, Shawn, Chaplin, and Carradine are all regular collaborators of iconoclastic director Alan Rudolph, who filmed The Moderns in Montréal and would go on to lens the similarly intellectual Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. by Brian J.

Sweeney, Robert Patrick, Craig Sheffer, Peter Berg, James Garner, Henry Thomas, Bradley Gregg, Noble Willingham, Full Credits One of the most famous real-life UFO abduction cases on record becomes this character-driven drama from sci-fi screenwriter Tracy Torme. D.B. Sweeney stars as Travis Walton, a forestry worker who disappears one night during an encounter with a flying saucer. Authorities treat with skepticism the outrageous story related by the only witnesses to the event, Travis' five co-workers, who include his best friend and future brother-in-law, Mike Rogers (Robert Patrick). A state lawman (James Garner) finds a tabloid newspaper in the crew's pickup truck and quickly ascertains that tensions had arisen between Walton and a surly fellow logger (Craig Sheffer), leading him to conclude that a murder cover-up is underway. However, all of the men pass lie detector tests and the case becomes stalled until the shocking last-minute reappearance of Travis, who tells a literally fantastic story involving his whereabouts for the past week. by Karl Williams, Rovi Keywords: alien [not human] experiment friendship kidnapping killing logger UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) missing capture false-accusation Themes: Miscarriage of Justice Exclusive coverage Classic Ten - Alien Abductions - AMC Movie Blog - AMCfrom AMC Blogs click here Currently 2/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) The X-Files [TV Series] (1993) Karhozat (1988) It Came from Outer Space (1953) Angel Heart (1987) Last Season (1987) Fearless (1993) Latitude 55° (1982) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Suave gangster Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken) meets four young men who have taken over his regular booth at a popular bistro. Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others. by Michael Betzold, Rovi Keywords: betrayal gangster kidnapping ransom college-student Themes: Thrill Crime Crime Gone Awry Kidnapping click here Currently 3/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies The Hit (1984) The Ref (1994) Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) Dead Silence (1991) Northern Exposure: Aurora Borealis - A Fairytale for Big People (1990) Barquero (1970) Attack The Gas Station!

Some situations in the film are presented as memories -- the way the central figure, Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke) recalls events many years later. At a Florida fishing village, eight-year-old orphan Finn Bell (Jeremy James Kissner), talented at art, is left in the care of his sister and her husband, Joe (Chris Cooper). One day, Finn helps a chained, escaped convict who appears in the surf. On other days, he visits Paradiso Perduto, where he plays with young Estella (Raquel Beaudene), niece of the mansion's colorful, flamboyant, and extremely wealthy owner, Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), who parallels the novel's tragic Miss Havisham, a woman jilted at the altar and left emotionally scarred and mentally imbalanced. As Ms. Dinsmoor watches Finn draw a portrait of Estella, she plots to mold Estella into a hard woman capable of destroying men. In a flash forward to the '90s, Finn (Hawke) and Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), now in their late teens, re-create the water-fountain kiss of their childhood, but Estella vanishes, breaking Finn's heart to such a degree that he doesn't draw or paint for seven years, choosing to eke out a marginal existence with his uncle Joe (after Finn's sister abandons the two). Then Manhattan art representative Jerry Ragno (Josh Mostel) turns up with a startling offer -- if Finn will return to painting and relocate in New York, Ragno will give him a one-man show. With an apparent assist from Ms. Dinsmoor, Finn makes the move and begins his new life with great expectations and a deadline of 10 weeks to complete the necessary paintings. When Finn next encounters Estella, she has a wealthy boyfriend, Walter (Hank Azaria). As Finn once again becomes entranced by Estella, he also begins to question exactly how his life is being manipulated. Francesco Clemente did the paintings and drawings seen in the film.

The Pearl Harbor bombing makes transfer impossible, especially with the Japanese preparing to invade the islands. So Brickley and Ryan go to work, first as message carriers between the Philippines and Corregidor, then, finally, as ship hunters. They record some successes, but it's a doomed effort: The Americans are hopelessly outnumbered by the Japanese, and with almost all of the Pacific Fleet destroyed at Pearl Harbor, they know help won't arrive to save them. As the Japanese push the U.S. forces back, Brickley and Ryan and their crews hop from island to island, scrounging supplies and taking casualties but keeping up the fight. Just as it appears that they will be forced to fight on Corregidor against the Japanese, they get rescued; they're ordered home to promote their PT-boat successes, and they take the last plane out, hoping to return and avenge their defeats. by Nick Sambides, Jr., Rovi Keywords: captain [military] Navy PT-boats sacrifice war sea-battle fighting Japanese [nationality] American [nationality] Themes: Military Life War At Sea ...ranks in these movie lists: The Best War Movies of John Wayne (#3) John Wayne's Best Movies (#11) click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies My Darling Clementine (1946) Stagecoach (1939) From Here to Eternity (1953) The Searchers (1956) The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) Patterns (1956) Rio Bravo (1959) In Which We Serve (1942) Run Silent, Run Deep (1958) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

It was made into a classic film in 1931 and inspired the 1940 hit movie His Girl Friday, in which the reporter was changed into a woman. Billy Wilder also remade the original film in 1974. Switching Channels is a 1988 remake of His Girl Friday, with Kathleen Turner in the starring role, which has now morphed into that of a cable television network news anchor, Christy Colleran. She wants to marry a rich and handsome sporting goods manufacturer, Blaine Bingham (Christopher Reeve) and move out of town. But her ex-husband, John L. Sullivan IV (Burt Reynolds), who is also her producer and boss, gives her one final assignment to try to keep her around. Her reporting leads her into an investigation of a jail escape that follows a botched-up execution.

With the not inconsiderable contribution of cinematographer Gregg Toland, Ford literally recreates the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, and even manages to build up suspense by filming several scenes of the unsuspecting military personnel at work, play, and worship. So convincing were many of the attack scenes that they have since been excerpted in several documentaries, leading the more impressionable viewers to ponder why the film's cameramen were foresighted enough to have set up their equipment at the precise moment of the bombing! As originally intended, the film, narrated by Walter Huston, was a stern criticism of America's lack of preparedness at Pearl Harbor (the entire fleet were lined up like sitting ducks). The government didn't like this aspect of December 7th and ordered it removed; still, the remaining 34-minute docudrama (pared down from feature length) ended up winning an Academy Award. by Hal Erickson, Rovi Keywords: attack bombing war Themes: Great Battles click here Currently 3/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies The Battle of Midway (1942) Pearl Harbor (2001) This is Korea (1951) Tonight or Never (1931) Pearl Harbor (2001) Washington Masquerade (1932) Johann the Coffinmaker (1927) December 7th: The Movie (1943) Pearl Harbor: Surprise Attack (1989) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

As uncompromising as ever, he found considerable difficulty securing backing for his ambitious projects. Unsure he would be able to film it, the director, an aspiring artist before he entered filmmaking, converted Kagemusha into a series of paintings, and it was partly on the basis of these that he won the financial support of longtime admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. Set in the 16th century, when powerful warlords competed for control of Japan, it offers an examination of the nature of political power and the slipperiness of identity. For some time, Shingen Takeda Tatsuya Nakadai has been able to stay removed from the heat of battle by using his brother Nobukado Tsutomu Yamazaki as a double. As the film opens, Nobukado offers another option, having discovered a condemned thief (also played by Tatsuya Nakadai) bearing an uncanny resemblance to the warlord. After he insists on witnessing the fall of an enemy in person, Shingen falls victim to a sniper's bullet, forcing his advisers to present the thief as the fallen warrior. At first awkward in his new position and plagued by dreams in which the spirit of his double confronts him, he slowly grows into the role even as his enemies begin to advance on his kingdom.

Victor (voice of Johnny Depp) lives in a small European village in the 19th century, where he is pledged to marry Victoria (voice of Emily Watson), a partnership arranged by their parents. The two only meet the day before their scheduled nuptials, and Victor performs disastrously in the wedding rehearsal. Later that evening, while he is walking through the woods and hopelessly practicing his vows, he puts Victoria's wedding band on what looks like a branch. Victor quickly discovers this was a big mistake; as it happens, he has put the ring on the skeletal finger of the enchanted Corpse Bride (voice of Helena Bonham Carter), who then whisks him off to a dark and mysterious netherworld where they are now married. Victor is frightened in the land of the dead, and even realizes that he has fallen in love with his true fiancée, Victoria, so he searches for a way back to his own world. Directed by Tim Burton in collaboration with animator Mike Johnson, Corpse Bride features a stellar voice cast, including Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, Richard E.

The foursome attends a picnic in honor of a pair of newlyweds, who put a damper on the proceedings (literally!) by drowning in a nearby lake. Evidently unscathed by this tragedy, Gerald and Rupert participate in a nude wrestling match later that evening (this was the sequence that got the most press, thanks to fleeting glimpses of the male stars' privates). Gerald marries Gudrun, Rupert weds Ursula, and the foursome embarks upon a Swiss honeymoon. The holiday is marred by infidelity and sudden death, leaving Rupert to wonder aloud just what it is that makes men and women \"tick.\" An Academy Award went to Glenda Jackson, while nominations were bestowed upon screenwriter Larry Kramer and cinematographer Billy Williams (who received an uncredited assist from director Ken Russell). by Hal Erickson, Rovi Keywords: artist bisexuality couple drowning friendship honeymoon lust marriage newlywed promiscuity schoolteacher sister love-affair Themes: Infidelity Sexual Awakening click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) El Norte (1983) Georgy Girl (1966) The Wings of the Dove (1997) Two English Girls (1971) Alfie (1966) The Rocking Horse Winner (1949) The Go-Between (1971) Tommy (1975) A Man and a Woman (1966) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Both sisters have already had brushes with death: Ullman has had an affair which prompted her husband's suicide, while Thulin has long wanted to do away with herself, at one point mutilating her own vagina out of self-hatred. As for Andersson, she has been in pain so long that she feels as though she's in the midst of death-in-life. With her two sisters wrapped up in their own problems, Harriet turns to her housekeeper Kari Sylwan for comfort; Sylwan has herself suffered the death of a child, and has developed a philosophical attitude towards impending doom. One of the most influential moments of the film -- when two of the sisters share the innermost thoughts that they'd kept from one another for so many years -- is filmed without benefit of dialogue, with the music of Chopin (enhanced by cinematographer Sven Nykvist's carefully selected camera angles) \"speaking\" for the ladies. While Cries and Whispers only won the Oscar for cinematography, the film did very well for itself in international awards contests. by Hal Erickson, Rovi Keywords: compassion death depression family friendship terminal-illness repression servant sex sister tuberculosis Themes: Servants and Employers Crumbling Marriages Sibling Relationships Dysfunctional Families click here Currently 5/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies The Seventh Seal (1957) Five Easy Pieces (1970) Autumn Sonata (1978) Fanny & Alexander (1982) Wild Strawberries (1957) Scenes from a Marriage (1974) Cleo from 5 to 7 (1962) Through a Glass Darkly (1961) Daleká cesta (1949) Shame (1968) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager at the fancy Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Paul is a Hutu, and a very successful businessman who smoothly greases the wheels, making powerful connections in all strata of Rwandan life. His wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo of Aeon Flux), is a Tutsi. She urges Paul to use his influence to help local Tutsis, who are being harassed and beaten with increasing frequency, but Paul will only use the political capital he's built up to help his own family, if and when they need it. Soon enough, the violence escalates, and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country, and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered, and before long, the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some, putting his life in danger, and the predicament of his \"guests\" grows more precarious every day, but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) and a UN peacekeeping colonel (Nick Nolte), the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre.

Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand) is a bright, loving, but strict single parent whose distrust of rock music and fears about drug use have helped to drive a wedge between herself and her two children, Anita (Zooey Deschanel) and William (Patrick Fugit). Anita rebels by dropping out of school and becoming a stewardess, but William makes something of his love of rock & roll by writing album reviews for a local underground newspaper. William's work attracts the attention of Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of renegade rock magazine Creem, who takes William under his wing and gives him his first professional writing assignment -- covering a Black Sabbath concert. While William is unable to score an interview with the headliners, the opening act, Stillwater, are more than happy to chat with a reporter, even if he's still too young to drive, and William's piece on the group in Creem gains him a new admirer in Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen), an editor at Rolling Stone. Torres offers William an assignment for a 3,000-word cover story on Stillwater, and over the objections of his mother (whose parting words are \"Don't use drugs!\"), and after some stern advice from Bangs (who says under no circumstances should he become friends with a band he's covering), Williams joins Stillwater on tour, where he becomes friendly with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). William also becomes enamored of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a groupie traveling with the band who is no older than William, but is deeply involved with Russell. Lester Bangs and Ben Fong-Torres, incidentally, were real-life rock writers Crowe worked with closely during his days as a journalist. Almost Famous' original score was composed by Nancy Wilson of Heart (who is also Crowe's wife). by Mark Deming, Rovi Keywords: advice writing band [music group] concert journalism magazine youth Themes: Innocence Lost Unrequited Love Writer's Life Mothers and Sons Child Prodigies Musician's Life Exclusive coverage SciFi Power Ranking - June 2, 2008from SciFi Scanner ...ranks in these movie lists: Favorite Movies 2000s (#16) Coming of Age Movies (#7) click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Rushmore (1998) Dazed and Confused (1993) Say Anything...

Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators.

Isabelle Adjani stars as Marguerite de Valois, better known as Margot, daughter of scheming Catholic power player Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi). Margot is an heiress to the throne during the late 16th century reign of the neurotic, hypochondriac King Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade), a time when Protestants and Catholics are vying for political control of France. Catherine decides to make an overture of good will by offering up Margot in marriage to prominent Protestant Huguenot Henri of Navarre (Daniel Auteuil), although she also schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, when tens of thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot doesn't love Henri and takes a lover, the soldier La Mole (Vincent Perez), also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son Anjou (Pascal Greggory) on the throne threatens the lives of La Mole, Margot and Henri.

A live-action framing device establishes the dark yet fanciful mood one might expect from an adaptation of a Roald Dahl story, as young British lad James (Paul Terry) is orphaned by the death of his parents and forced to live with two cruel, repulsive aunts (played by noted British character actors Miriam Margolyes and Joanna Lumley of British TV hit Absolutely Fabulous). The visit of a mysterious stranger provides a means of escape, however, through a magic bag of \"crocodile tongues\" that bring about the appearance of the giant peach. The curious James soon winds up inside the fruit, at which point his body changes, and the film switches to a combination of stop-motion and digital animation. The new James meets up with a group of talking, oversized insects, including a vampish spider (voiced by Susan Sarandon), a sarcastic centipede (voiced by Richard Dreyfuss), and a matronly ladybug (voiced by Jane Leeves). These creatures become his traveling companions when the peach rolls into the Atlantic Ocean, and James and his new friends must brave a variety of dangers to reach the shore. Director Henry Selick provides further proof of the visual skill he demonstrated in The Nightmare Before Christmas, creating a fascinating, often eerie alternate universe, while Randy Newman provides the upbeat musical accompaniment. Young children may be disturbed by the story's creepier overtones, but the mixture of remarkable visuals, oddball characters, and off-kilter fantasy will appeal to all other audiences. by Judd Blaise, Rovi Keywords: aunt dream family fantasy magic orphan reality vagabond fantasy-world death-in-family Themes: Orphans Runaways Authority Figures [k] Exclusive coverage AFI Dallas 2009 - Henry Selick Carries Coraline on the Red Carpet - AMC News - AMCfrom AMC Blogs Mary Robinette Kowal - Why Do Fantasy Movies Always Kill the Parents? - SciFi Scanner - AMCfrom AMC Blogs Mary Robinette Kowal - The Many Fantastic Flicks of Mr. Roald Dahl - SciFi Scanner - AMCfrom AMC Blogs ...ranks in these movie lists: Roald Dahl's Fantasy Movies (#6) click here Currently 3/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Ed Wood (1994) Toy Story (1995) Toy Story 2 (1999) Finding Nemo (2003) Batman (1989) The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) Tin Toy (1988) Porco Rosso (1992) Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) Once Around (1991) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Freeman, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Full Credits Joel and Ethan Coen's third collaboration, the gangster film Miller's Crossing, stars Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan, the right-hand man of big-city Irish mob boss Leo (Albert Finney). The film opens with Italian mobster Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) and his second in command Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) informing Leo and Tom that they are going to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) because he has been revealing Caspar's fixed fights to other gamblers. Leo informs Caspar that Bernie pays for protection and is not to be touched. After the Italians leave in a huff, Tom informs Leo that he should give up Bernie.

American audiences are introduced to Ten Years After, featuring guitar great Alvin Lee. Jimi Hendix, The Who and Joe Cocker give riveting performances. As naked flower children romp, the New York freeway is closed because of traffic congestion. Music lovers leave their cars and travel on foot only survive torrential downpours of rain, food shortages and non-stop music. Jefferson Airplane gives the wake up call with their song \"Volunteers Of America.\" Crosby, Stills and Nash deliver a memorable performance. John Sebastian gives an impromptu set with a borrowed guitar from Tim Hardin. Santana, Sly and The Family Stone, Sha-Na-Na, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens and Joan Baez also appear. The movie did big box office business and a successful three record set sold millions of copies. The Grateful Dead, Credence Clearwater Revival and Janis Joplin performed but were not shown in the film. The Dead's Jerry Garcia recalled that it was the worst live show the band ever did, ironic for a band known for their spirited live performances. by Dan Pavlides, Rovi Keywords: drugs hippie mud music performer protester rock-music songwriter rock-band folk-music Themes: Generation Gap Bohemian Life Exclusive coverage Classic Ten - Greatest Concert Movies - AMC Movie Blog - AMCfrom AMC Blogs ...ranks in these movie lists: Rockin' Concert Movies (#1) click here Currently 5/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) The Last Waltz (1978) M*A*S*H (1970) The Rolling Stones: Gimme Shelter (1970) Das Boot (1981) Monterey Pop (1968) That Was Rock (1965) Wattstax (1972) Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) Come and See (1985) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Graham Produced By: Universal Year: 1969 Run Time: 93 minutes Country: USA Language: English MPAA Rating: R Category: Feature Genre/Type: Drama Filmed In: Color Key Cast: Elvis Presley, Mary Tyler Moore, Barbara McNair, Jane Elliot, Leora Dana, Ed Asner, Robert Emhardt, Regis Toomey, Full Credits Dr. John Carpenter (Elvis Presley) helps the economically disadvantaged in an inner-city medical clinic. Three nuns are assigned to help out at the facility and are allowed to wear regular clothes instead of the traditional habits. Sister Michelle (Mary Tyler Moore) is the speech therapist who Dr. Carpenter would like to examine personally after hours. Along with the other sisters (Barbara McNair and Jane Elliot), Michelle is subjected to the criticism of the local parish priest (Regis Toomey) in the social experiment of non-traditional dress. Two spinsters even mistake the nuns for prostitutes without their habits. The priest wins out in the end, and the nuns must again don their habits. As the good doctor sings to the ailing children, Sister Michelle is transfixed both by a crucifix hanging on the wall and by Elvis Presley in an ironic and symbolic scene that flashes between the two icons. This was Presley's last studio feature and he welcomed the move from stifling screen images as he returned his focus to live performances and recording for the remainder of his illustrious career. by Dan Pavlides, Rovi Keywords: clinic doctor/nurse ghetto nun peeping-tom rape forbidden-love Themes: Members of the Clergy click here Currently 1/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies The Sound of Music (1965) Lilies of the Field (1963) Going My Way (1944) Jesus of Montreal (1989) Remparts d'Argile (1970) Historias del Subdesarrollo (1968) The Fugitive (1948) Black Robe (1991) The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) King Creole (1958) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Oliver O'Grady was a Catholic priest who served in a number of parishes in Southern California during the 1970s and '80s. O'Grady was also a habitual child molester who abused dozens of youngsters who were entrusted to his care, and while his superiors in the church were aware of O'Grady's crimes as early as 1973, they opted to simply move him from one congregation to another rather than turn him in to authorities or strip him of his ordination. In Deliver Us From Evil, a number of O'Grady's victims and their families discuss his crimes and the repercussions they feel to this day. O'Grady himself also appears in the film, speaking candidly about his career as a sexual predator and recounting his misdeeds in detail. (After finally being convicted of child sexual abuse, O'Grady served time in prison and now lives in Ireland, where he is still looked after by Catholic clergy.) Berg also offers a look into the history of the Catholic Church and how its leadership has often protected those within the hierarchy at the expense of their worshipers. Deliver Us From Evil was named Best Documentary Feature at the 2006 Los Angeles Film Festival. by Mark Deming, Rovi Keywords: Catholicism priest shame aftermath child-molestation Themes: Domestic Abuse Members of the Clergy Rape & Sexual Abuse Wolf in Sheep's Clothing click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Capturing the Friedmans (2002) Twist of Faith (2004) Holy Water-Gate: Abuse Cover-Up in the Catholic Church (2004) Hand of God (2006) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

The lad is 15-year-old Mitchell Goosen who is sent from sunny southern California to snowy Cincinnati to live with relatives while his parents go on a long trip to Australia. The boy comes to the Ohio city clutching his surfboard and meets his goofy cousin who quickly becomes his friend. Naturally his laid back West Coast ways make him the subject of ridicule in his new high school. His biggest foe is the school jock. The pain of his new life is eased a bit after Mitchell meets perky blond Nikki. They talk and then he is forced to play in a hockey game. Mitchell has no idea what hockey is about but still manages to score the winning goal causing him to be the victim of more ostracism. In the spring, he begins rollerblading and the other kids are amazed by his many stunts. Eventually, he uses his skills to win the respect of his enemies and Niki's heart, but not without a lot more daring skating escapades. by Sandra Brennan, Rovi Keywords: boy roller-blading romance sports teenagers coming-of-age new-kid-in-town Themes: Fish Out of Water Underdogs High School Life First Love New Kid in Town click here Currently 2/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Walkabout (1971) Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) Radio Days (1987) Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) Brown of Harvard (1926) The Secret of NIMH (1982) The Karate Kid (1984) Eating Raoul (1982) The Master of Ballantrae (1984) Divided Loyalties (1990) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Pat O'Malley, Verna Felton, Full Credits The final animated feature produced under the supervision of Walt Disney is a lively neo-swing musical, loosely based upon the tales of Rudyard Kipling. The story takes place in a tropical jungle where people are conspicuously absent. But one day Bagheera the Panther (voice of Sebastian Cabot) discovers a baby in the wreck of a boat. Feeling pity on the child, Bagheera takes him to be raised with the wolves. Ten years later, the child has grown into Mowgli (voice of Bruce Reitherman). Mowgli discovers that his life is in danger because of the return to the area of Shere Khan the Tiger (voice of George Sanders), whose hatred of humans is such that Mowgli faces certain death if discovered. Bagheera agrees to transport Mowgli to the human village, where he will be safe from Shere Khan. Along the way to the village, night falls and Mowgli and Bagheera almost succumb to the man-eating snake Kaa (voice of Sterling Holloway). Escaping Kaa's coils, they run into the lock-step military elephant band of Colonel Hathi (voice of J. Pat O'Malley). Afterwards, Mowgli, who doesn't want to be sent to the human village, runs away from Bagheera and meets up with the fun-loving Baloo the Bear (voice of Phil Harrris). With both Bagheera and Baloo to protect him, Mowgli is saved from several more life-threatening situations -- including a barber-shop quartet of vultures, the crazed King Louie of the Apes (voice of Louis Prima), and Shere Khan himself -- before making it to the village of humans. by Paul Brenner, Rovi Keywords: bear boy jungle king orangutan roots [origins] tiger vultures wolf talking-animal feral-child Themes: Orphans Mischievous Children click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies The Jungle Book 2 (2003) Dumbo (1941) Fantasia (1940) Pinocchio (1940) Bambi (1942) Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!

Sunny (Glenn Close) -- who remains in a \"persistent vegetative state\" resulting from a suspicious injection of insulin -- narrates the film, summarizing the first murder trial, which ended with Claus (Jeremy Irons) convicted and released on bail pending appeal. Claus approaches Harvard Law professor Dershowitz (Ron Silver) to handle the case. Working with a small group of law students recruited from his classes, Dershowitz presents sufficient new evidence to cast doubt as to Claus' guilt and the veracity of the star witness, her maid. Jeremy Irons' extraordinary, Oscar-winning performance dominates the film. He plays the role of Claus with a alternatively pompous, aloof snobbishness and an engagingly enigmatic, kinky, sly humor. Barbet Schroeder was also nominated for an Academy Award for his extraordinary, off-beat, direction of this sophisticated, exceptionally intelligent legal drama. Reversal of Fortune with its sharp, witty, Oscar-nominated screenplay by Nicholas Kazan is unusual in its understanding that legal guilt and moral culpability are not the same thing -- making for an unusually provocative tragicomedy of bad manners and bad behavior among the rich. by Linda Rasmussen, Rovi Keywords: addiction drugs lawyer courtroom courtship decadence murder family investigation jury killing marriage marriage-problems socialite trial [courtroom] wife downward-mobility family-tragedy riches-to-rags false-accusation Themes: Treacherous Spouses Lawyers click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Belle de Jour (1967) Anatomy of a Murder (1959) Dead Ringers (1988) Witness for the Prosecution (1957) The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) The Murder of Mary Phagan (1987) Jagged Edge (1985) Barfly (1987) The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) More (1969) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Even though he's supposedly committed, Tomas continues his wanton womanizing, notably with his silken mistress Sabina (Lena Olin). Escaping the 1968 Russian invasion of Prague by heading for Geneva, Sabina takes up with another man and unexpectedly develops a friendship with Tereza. Meanwhile, Tomas, who previously was interested only in sex, becomes politicized by the collapse of Czechoslovakia's Dubcek regime. The Unbearable Lightness of Being may be too leisurely for some viewers, but other viewers may feel the same warm sense of inner satisfaction that is felt after finishing a good, long novel. by Hal Erickson, Rovi Keywords: extramarital-affair writing invasion demonstration [political] doctor/nurse love love-triangle photography politician riot [uprising] romance Themes: Bohemian Life Infidelity Love Triangles Political Unrest click here Currently 4/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Easy Rider (1969) Gone With the Wind (1939) Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) A Room With a View (1986) Withnail & I (1987) The Right Stuff (1983) The Mother and the Whore (1973) Cries and Whispers (1972) Jules and Jim (1962) The Philadelphia Story (1940) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

Sherry McGrale (Kim Dickens) is a punk-influenced singer and songwriter whose angry, deeply personal music has begun to win her a national following, though the demons that fuel her art are playing havoc with her life, as she drowns her sorrows in drugs and alcohol and fills a growing police blotter with arrests for disorderly conduct. Sherry is winning significant airplay for a song about the brutal rape of a young woman, and rock journalist Owen (Gabriel Mann) convinces his editor Pete (Rosanna Arquette) to assign him a major story on Sherry when he tells her he knows the truth about Sherry's own rape as an adolescent, which inspired the song. Owen is forced to run interference with Chuck (Don Cheadle), Sherry's manager and former boyfriend who is fiercely protective of his fragile client, but Owen is still able to meet with the singer. However, Owen finds that Sherry either can't or won't remember most of the details of the brutal and degrading assault, and she doesn't want to discuss the heavy toll it's taken upon her. Influential experimental rock group Sonic Youth contributed several original compositions for the film's score; Sherry's singing voice was provided by Kristen Vigard, who performed on the soundtrack of Grace of My Heart. by Mark Deming, Rovi Keywords: alcoholism boyfriend editor punk-rock rape reporter rock-music songwriter drug-addiction manager musician Themes: Haunted By the Past Members of the Press Musician's Life click here Currently 2/5 1 2 3 4 5 write your review Enter your review: Log In or Register to write your review username password Similar Movies Georgia (1995) The Rose (1979) Tape (2001) Grace of My Heart (1996) Prey for Rock & Roll (2003) Velvet Goldmine (1998) schedule movies amc originals blogs videos photos polls games store mobile subscribe to the amc newsletter About & Contact FAQ Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy network sites: AMCtv.com Filmsite.org Filmcritic.com Copyright 2010 American Movie Classics Company LLC.

With the use of flashback, a dying Dr. Viktor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) divulges a tale of gruesome terror to a sea captain (Aidan Quinn): As a medical student, the rebellious Frankenstein elaborates on the work of a brilliant scientist (John Cleese), successfully bringing to life a \"man\" assembled from the body parts of corpses. Upon realizing the destructive consequences of his experiment, Dr. Frankenstein abandons the creature and attempts to return to a normal life with his medical partner, Henry (Tom Hulce), and his fiancée (and adopted sister), Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). In the meantime, the nameless creature struggles with loneliness and rejection from society until he sets out to track down his creator in search of one of two things: a bride to keep him company or revenge.

Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay. by Mark Deming, Rovi Keywords: culture [social culture] dysfunctional experiment friendship graduation infatuation obsession uncertainty crossroads coming-of-age Themes: Teachers and Students Teen Angst Suburban Dysfunction Faltering Friendships Unlikely Friendships Exclusive coverage The Ten Best Comic Book Movies of the Decade - SciFi Scanner - AMCfrom AMC Blogs Acne Comics Presents...
