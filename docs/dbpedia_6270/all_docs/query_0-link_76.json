        "text": "Tex Avery:\n\nAfter working to help create the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons for the Walter Lantz studio in the early 30s, and then co-creating some of the most notable cartoon characters of all time at Warners in the late 30s and early 40s (for Leon Schlesinger), Tex Avery moved to MGM Studios in 1942, where from 1942 to 1957, he accelerated the pace and scope of animations and adopted new characters. At the end of his time at MGM, Avery continued his work with the Walter Lantz Studio (see further below).\n\nAvery's first cartoon for MGM, the anti-German propagandist short Blitz Wolf (1942), brought him his sole Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject. It was a wartime semi-parody of Disney's earlier Three Little Pigs (1933) with Adolf Wolf (a thinly-disguised Hitler, portrayed as \"one big stinker\") threatening to invade the state of Pigmania and the house of Sergeant Pork (US).\n\nBesides Tom & Jerry (see below), the other most popular MGM cartoon characters, Tex Avery's most famous and long-lasting at the studio, was the meek, slow-moving, sad, droopy-eyed, and slow-talking basset hound known as Droopy Dog. The emotionless, deadpan-voiced, yet stoic Droopy (known as \"Happy Hound\") made his nameless debut in MGM's Dumb-Hounded (1943). His first line of dialogue was: \"Hello all you happy people...you know what? I'm the hero.\" He finally received his proper name in his fifth cartoon, Senor Droopy (1949). Drag-Along Droopy (1954) was one of the classic Droopy cartoons, a spoof on range wars between sheepherders (Droopy) and ranchers (the Wolf's \"Bear Butte Ranch\"), as was Dixieland Droopy (1954) - the first Droopy cartoon in Cinemascope. One Droopy Knight (1957) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Subject - the character's sole nomination (after Avery left the studio).\n\nAvery also developed the character of wacky Screwy Squirrel, an angry anthropomorphic furry squirrel for Screwball Squirrel (1944) who appeared in only five cartoons from 1944 to 1946. Screwy's basic enemy was Meathead Dog. In addition, another short-lived animation series consisted of only five cartoons from 1946 to 1948. They starred a pair of mismatched bears named George and Junior (derived from the characters in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men novel, George and Lennie). The first George and Junior cartoon was Henpecked Hoboes (1946), while the last was Lucky Ducky (1948).\n\nTex Avery's MGM Cartoons (1942-1957) - New Characters\n\nBlitz Wolf (1942)\n\nRed Hot Riding Hood (1943)\n\nDumb-Hounded (1943)\n\nScrewball Squirrel (1944)\n\nAdolf Wolf\n\nRed\n\nDroopy Dog\n\n(first known as \"Happy Hound\")\n\nScrewy Squirrel\n\nHenpecked Hoboes (1946)\n\nLucky Ducky (1948)\n\n(l to r): Junior and George\n\n(l to r): Junior and George\n\nTex Avery's work was considered quite controversial when he created a sexy version of the well-known fairy tale Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) with a character known as Red, a sexy red-headed beauty.\n\n[ Note: It heavily influenced director Chuck Russell's The Mask (1994) featuring Jim Carrey as mild-mannered bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who was obsessed with cartoons. When Stanley donned a magical mask, he turned into an alter ego composed of Tex Avery-like cartoon characters - the Wolf (including a famous double-take with his eyes popping out of his head and a wolf whistle), the Tasmanian Devil (whirling like a tornado), and others. He even re-enacted portions of a classic Avery cartoon that he earlier watched on his VCR, Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), in the nightclub scene. All special effects were compliments of George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic.]\n\nWalter Lantz Studios: Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Woody Woodpecker, and Chilly Willy\n\nWalter Lantz, an early animator, and Charles Mintz (representing Universal and boss Carl Laemmle), took over the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from Walt Disney in 1928 - it was the first animated character for Universal Pictures. Mickey Rooney was the first to do the character's voice. The resemblance of Oswald to its biggest competitor, Disney's Mickey Mouse, was striking.\n\nLantz made a series of black-and-white cartoons from 1929 to 1935, featuring the rubber-limbed, long-eared rabbit, including these early titles:\n\nOzzie of the Circus (1929), Stage Stunt (1929), Stripes and Stars (1929), Wicked West (1929), Nuts and Bolts (1929), Ice Man's Luck (1929), Junegle Jingles (1929), Weary Willies (1929), Saucy Sausages (1929), Race Riot (1929), Oil's Well (1929), Permanent Wave (1929), Cold Turkey (1929), Amature Nite (1929), Snow Use (1929), Hurdy Gurdy (1929), and Nutty Notes (1929)\n\nLantz was noted for also making the first-ever Technicolor cartoon - the opening animated sequence to the live-action The King of Jazz (1930).\n\nAnother of Lantz' legendary creations was a new character - the red-headed, blue-bodied, long yellow-beaked, trouble-making Woody Woodpecker, with his distinctive trademarked laugh (\"Ha-Ha-Ha-HA-Ha\" by Mel Blanc) and voice (by Mel Blanc for the first four cartoons, and then by Ben \"Bugs\" Hardaway until 1948, and thereafter by Lantz' own wife Grace Stafford). Woody (looking slightly deranged and not like his later persona) first appeared in Lantz' Andy Panda cartoon Knock, Knock (1940) distributed by Universal Studios, in which he bedeviled the panda. The next year, the popular Woody became a starring character as \"Woody Woodpecker\" in The Cracked Nut (1941), and began to replace the waning Oswald the Rabbit.\n\nOver the next three decades, Lantz made about 200 six-minute Woody cartoons. Woody's appearance and demeanor was somewhat softened in The Barber of Seville (1944), but he still maintained his usually aggressive and slightly sadistic, manic personality. A long-time adversary of Woody's, Wally Walrus, was introduced in The Beach Nut (1944), the same year. Two Woody shorts were Oscar-nominees:\n\nThe Dizzy Acrobat (1943) - defeated by MGM's Tom & Jerry cartoon The Yankee Doodle Mouse\n\nMusical Moments From Chopin (1946) - defeated by MGM's Tom & Jerry cartoon The Cat Concerto\n\nIn 1948, the novelty tune, The Woody Woodpecker Song (written by George Tibble, Ramey Idriess and Danny Kaye) was released on record and became the #1 hit song (sung by Kay Kyser). The song was put into the latest cartoon, Wet Blanket Policy (1948) (with another new co-star arch-nemesis Buzz Buzzard) and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song (it lost to Buttons and Bows in The Paleface (1948)). Young boys copied Woody's haircut, and fan clubs developed across the country. In the late 50s, The Woody Woodpecker Show first appeared on ABC-TV in 1957 , and led to further shows and syndication.\n\nA less popular but distinctive Lantz cartoon character was Chilly Willy - a penguin, who first appeared in 1953 in a cartoon titled appropriately, Chilly Willy (1953). Chilly's popularity soared when animator Tex Avery joined the Lantz Studio the following year and directed Chilly's second and third cartoons: I'm Cold (1954) and Academy Award-nominated The Legend of Rock-a-bye Point (1955) for Best Short Subject Cartoon (it lost to Speedy Gonzales (1935), a Warner Bros.' Merrie Melodies cartoon). As with Woody, Chilly Willy cartoons appeared all the way until 1972 - the last year of production.\n\nHanna-Barbera's Tom & Jerry:\n\nIn their first full teaming together after first meeting at MGM and serving as co-directors in the studio's animation unit, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera created the cat and mouse Tom & Jerry series (clearly influenced by the frenetic action in Tex Avery's work at Warners). It was composed of comic adventures about Tom - a gray mangy cat, and Jerry - a wisely innocent mouse.\n\nWhen the cartoon series highlighting the love-hate relationship between the two animals was first introduced in 1940 with the 9-minute Technicolored pilot Puss Gets the Boot (1940), Hanna and Barbera received their first Oscar nomination. In this first appearance of the characters, both Tom and Jerry were unidentified as such: Tom was called 'Jasper' and the mouse had no name.\n\nHanna-Barbera's Tom & Jerry (1940-1957)\n\nIntroduced in a Pilot Episode\n\nMGM Cartoon Title Screen\n\nThe Only Screen Credit -- Produced by Rudolf Ising, (directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera)\n\nPuss Gets the Boot (1940)\n\nOver 100 cartoons from 1940 to 1957 featured the two cartoon characters, and Hanna and Barbera were able to break Disney's Oscar monopoly for award-winning cartoons. They won more Academy Awards than any other cartoon series in history, except for Disney's Silly Symphonies that also won the same number. They won seven Oscars for Best Short Subject: Cartoon for the following animated cartoons, all in the Tom & Jerry series:\n\nYankee Doodle Mouse (1943) - the 11th Tom & Jerry short, and the first cartoon to use their Tom & Jerry red and yellow sunburst opening and closing title cards\n\nMouse Trouble (1944) - the 17th Tom & Jerry short\n\nQuiet, Please! (1945) - the 22nd Tom & Jerry short; also one of the few cartoons in which Tom spoke\n\nThe Cat Concerto (1947) - the 29th Tom & Jerry short, and the fourth consecutive Oscar win in the category; the two studios in competition for the award, MGM and Warners (with Friz Freleng's Rhapsody Rabbit (1946) starring Bugs Bunny), accused each other of plagiarism for similar plot lines\n\nThe Little Orphan (1949)\n\nThe Two Mouseketeers (1952)\n\nJohann Mouse (1953) - the last and 7th film to win an Oscar; Jerry - the mouse, couldn't resist waltzing when he heard music from the master of the house, Viennese composer Johann Strauss. Tom, also a resident in the household of the Maestro, took piano lessons to keep Jerry dancing and entranced - so that he could snatch him.\n\nOne of their most famous cartoons was the 19th short, Mouse in Manhattan (1945) that featured a score by Scott Bradley (made up mostly of Louis Alter's Manhattan Serenade later used in The Godfather (1972) and Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown's \"Broadway Rhythm\") - it told about Jerry's adventures in the big city. It was one of only a few episodes where only one of the characters played a major role.\n\nLater, in a few famous sequences, Jerry the mouse danced with Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh (1945) - the first instance of the combination of live action and animation in a feature film. Tom and Jerry also performed an underwater fantasy dance with Esther Williams in Dangerous When Wet (1953). Famed animator Chuck Jones was assigned to produce new episodes for Tom and Jerry cartoons in the 70s at MGM - but they had lost their spunk and spirit by that time - and were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe First Full-Length Animated Film:\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studio Feature Films (1937-present)\n\nDecade of the 1930s No. Title Screen Title (Year) Notables 1 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nbased on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm\n\nthe first, full-length cel-animated, hand-drawn featured film\n\nthe earliest Disney Animated Feature Film\n\nderided by Disney's critics as \"Disney's Folly\"\n\nAcademy Award nominated for Best Musical Score\n\nat the time of its release, it briefly held the record for highest-grossing (domestic) sound film\n\nits unofficial sequel was Filmation's Happily Ever After (1990)\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood cartoon comedy was in the late 1930s and 1940s. The earliest animated films that most people remember seeing are the later, more sophisticated Disney feature films that contain exquisite detail, flowing movements, gorgeous and rich color, enchanting characters, lovely musical songs and tunes, and stories drawn with magical or mythological plots. The first, full-length animated film was Disney's classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) released on December 21, 1937 (wide release on February 4, 1938), which took four years to make and cost $1.5 million dollars. It was 1938's top moneymaker at $8 million.\n\nIt was financed due in part to the success of Disney's earlier animated short, The Three Little Pigs (1933). Although dubbed \"Disney's Folly\" during the three-four year production of the musical animation, Disney realized that he had to expand and alter the format of cartoons. He used a multi-plane camera, first utilized in his animated, Oscar-winning Silly Symphonies short, The Old Mill (1937) to create an illusion of depth and movement. His version of the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale was the second of its kind - the first was a five-minute Snow White (1933) starring Betty Boop (with an appearance by Cab Calloway). Disney's risk-taking paid off when the film became a financial and critical success.\n\n[Note: It must be stated that another little-known but pioneering, oldest-surviving feature-length animated film that can be verified (with silhouette animation techniques and color tinting) was released more than a decade earlier by German film-maker and avante-garde artist Lotte Reiniger, The Adventures of Prince Achmed (aka Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed) (1926, Germ.), based on the stories from the Arabian Nights.]\n\nDisney's Golden Age of Hollywood Animations in the 40s:\n\nThe critically-praised Pinocchio (1940) released on February 7, 1940 and based on Carlo Collodi's 1883 fable made a record $2.6 million and became the highest-earning film of the year. This second Disney animated feature also won two Oscars, for Best Musical Score and Best Original Song (When You Wish Upon a Star). It was the rites of passage story of a wooden puppet (with Tyrolean britches) that came alive. The good-intentioned but naughty boy was accompanied by an ingenuous narrator/carpetbagger named Jiminy Cricket who served as the boy's conscience (and sounded like Benjamin Franklin). The ingenious animation used the multi-plane camera technique to create an amazingly life-like animation.\n\nDisney experimented with other milestone, ground-breaking techniques that combined classical music and animation in seven separate episodes in the film Fantasia (1940), released on November 13, 1940, and January 29, 1941 (roadshow). The film, with a production cost of more than $2 million (about four times more than an average live-action picture), featured Mickey Mouse as the star of the picture in Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the mouse's only appearance in a feature cartoon. It was the first film to be released in a multichannel stereo sound format called Fantasound - decades ahead of its time - requiring a special system devised for playback, although it was rarely shown that way due to the expense (and the fact that only 6 theaters were equipped to play Fantasound).\n\nFantasia was the fullest expression of Disney's earlier work on Silly Symphonies. [Note A sequel of sorts was released 60 years later, originally in the IMAX format, Fantasia/2000 (1999), with new interpretations of classical music (including Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance, Stravinsky's Firebird, Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 - and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue), plus a replay of The Sorcerer's Apprentice.]\n\nOther great classic Disney tales, animated features, and storybooks in the 40s included (see also below):\n\nDumbo (1941) - the story of the baby elephant with big flying ears, released on October 23, 1941\n\nBambi (1942) - the masterfully poetic tale of woodland creatures and a young fawn, with the shattering scene of the killing of Bambi's mother; released on April 16, 1942 [Note: although the second Disney animated film to go into production, it ended up being the fifth release, due to extensive time-consuming research conducted on animals to make it appear exceedingly realistic]\n\nSaludos Amigos (1942), released on August 24, 1942 (premiere in Mexico City); advertised as \"Walt Disney Goes South American\" with the introduction of Joe Carioca, the Brazilian Jitterbird\n\nThe Three Caballeros (1944), released on December 21, 1944 (premiere in Mexico City) and February 3, 1945; in this animated and live-action combined film, Donald Duck danced with \"Brazilian Girl\" Aurora Miranda\n\nMake Mine Music (1946), released on April 20, 1946; a more modernized version of Fantasia (1940) with popular music by Benny Goodman, the Andrews Sisters, and Dinah Shore; the anthology included 10 film segments including the classic tales Casey at the Bat, The Martins and the Coys, and Peter and the Wolf; also Blue Bayou, All the Cats Join In, Without You, Two Silhouettes, After You've Gone, Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet, and The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met\n\nThe Song of the South (1946), released on November 12, 1946, was Disney's first live-action feature film, but also contained three major segments of animation; it was based upon Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus folk tales regarding Br'er Rabbit; due to extensive protests (mostly by the NAACP) over the stereotypical representations of blacks in the film and the romanticizing of slavery, the controversial film was never released on home video for US audiences; the film's hit song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" won the Academy Awards Oscar for Best Song\n\nFun and Fancy Free (1947), released on September 27, 1947; a combination of live-action and animation; with two storylines, including Bongo (hosted by Jiminy Cricket and narrated by Dinah Shore) about a circus bear, and Mickey and the Beanstalk\n\nMelody Time (1948), released on May 27, 1948;

its financial success helped to reverse Disney's debt and declining fortunes\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951), released on July 28, 1951; the Disney adaptation of Lewis Carroll classics; its failure at the box-office offset the profits from the previous year's successful Cinderella\n\nPeter Pan (1953), released on February 5, 1953;

[Taking into account reissues and re-releases over the years as well as the original releases, the order of these top-grossing animated films of all time has been rearranged, placing Cinderella (1950) first, followed by Lady and the Tramp (1955) and then Peter Pan (1953).]\n\nWalt Disney achieved a milestone in the 1954 awards ceremony - as the individual with the most Oscar wins (4) in a single year. He won the award in four awards categories, including one film which was animated: Best Cartoon Short Subject: Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (1953).\n\nUPA Productions - Columbia Studios:\n\nSome who left Disney Studios around the time of the studio's 1941 strike later established United Productions of America (UPA), a studio for cartoons distributed by Columbia. It was known for simplified, stylized, more contemporary animated drawings of characters (with limited movement but boldly colored) in the Jolly Frolics cartoon series (38 theatrical cartoons released from 1948 to 1959). The two main characters were:\n\nGerald McBoing-Boing (first seen in the cartoon Gerald McBoing-Boing (1951)), a character developed by Dr. Seuss\n\nMister (J. Quincy) Magoo (with voice by Jim Backus), a near-sighted (myopic), short-statured, elderly gentleman, inspired in part by famous comic W.C. Fields\n\nMister Magoo's first appearance in a cartoon was The Ragtime Bear (1949) - found in the Jolly Frolics series of cartoons. The second cartoon, at the start of a Mister Magoo series of cartoons, was Spellbound Hound (1950). Over the years from 1949 to 1959, the Mister Magoo cartoons (53 in total) were honored with two Academy Awards (from five nominations) for Best Animated Short Film: When Magoo Flew (1954) (it was the first UPA short filmed in CinemaScope), and Magoo's Puddle Jumper (1956).\n\nUPA also developed a popular animated TV series titled Mister Magoo that aired from 1960-1962 (with 130 episodes).\n\nThe First Mister Magoo Theatrical Cartoons TV Series The Ragtime Bear (1949) Spellbound Hound (1950) Mister Magoo Show\n\n(1960-1962)\n\nMister Magoo also starred in UPA's first feature-length cartoon film, the 76-minute 1001 Arabian Nights (1959), an adaptation of the Aladdin folktale with Magoo as Aladdin's uncle. The theatrical animation, released by Columbia Pictures, was the studio's first animated feature. Walt Disney Pictures also released a poorly-rated, live-action version of the character, Mr. Magoo (1997) directed by Stanley Tong (his sole English language film), with Leslie Nielsen as the title character.\n\nCrusader Rabbit - The First US Animated TV Series:\n\nAnimator Jay Ward, working with Alexander Anderson, Jr (whose idea was first turned down at Terrytoon Studios), created the immensely-popular animated, serialized NBC-TV show Crusader Rabbit, through their new company Television Arts Productions. It was the first American animated series produced especially for television.\n\nThe show originally aired from 1950 -1952 and also had a color version in 1957, with both Lucille Bliss and GeGe Pearson providing the voice of the Don Quixote-like title character. It told about knight-in-armor Crusader Rabbit and his tiger companion Rags, combating nemesis Dudley Nightshade, with episodes ending in a cliffhanger.\n\n[Note: Ward went on to produce more animated cartoon shows, such as The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show - composed of Rocky and His Friends (1959-1961) and The Bullwinkle Show (1961-1964), Hoppity Hooper (1964-1967), George of the Jungle (1967), and The Dudley Do-Right Show (1969-1970) about a Canadian Mountie. The only live-action TV comedy show that he produced was Fractured Flickers (1963).]\n\nHanna and Barbera:\n\nIn the late 50s after their success with Tom and Jerry cartoons, Hanna-Barbera formed their own company in 1957 (a division of Warner Bros.' Animation). They were one of the earliest animation studios to become successful producing animated cartoon TV shows for television, but were often criticized for their crude, low-budget animations.\n\nH-B Enterprises (the first name of the company) became responsible for the following cartoon shows, and their related spin-offs:\n\nThe Ruff 'n' Ready Show (1957-1960) -H-B's first TV show, for three seasons, with 50 episodes, about the adventures of a dog (Reddy) and cat (Ruff)\n\nThe Huckleberry Hound Show (1958-1962) - H-B's first major hit about a blue anthropomorphic dog, with secondary stars Yogi Bear and Boo Boo (who became the subjects of their own spin-off series in 1961); it was the first animated TV program honored with an Emmy Award (Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Children's Programming), and the first H-B show to become syndicated\n\nThe Quick Draw McGraw Show (1959-1961) - starring an anthropomorphic western horse, for three seasons, with 45 episodes\n\nThe Flintstones (1960-1966) - set in the Stone Age, but loosely based upon the live-action sitcom The Honeymooners, also ABC-TV's first series to be televised in color, and the first animated series to be broadcast in prime-time; it ran for six seasons (with 166 episodes) and at the time, it became the longest-running animated prime-time show in US TV history (a record it held for three decades until bypassed by The Simpsons)\n\nThe Yogi Bear Show (1961-1962) - H-B's first spin-off series (from The Huckleberry Hound Show), with 33 episodes over a two-year period\n\nTop Cat (1961-1962) - H-B's series ran simultaneously with The Yogi Bear Show, for two seasons, with 30 episodes\n\nThe Jetsons (1962-1963) - a Space-Age version of the popular The Flintstones; originally for two seasons, with 24 episodes\n\nJonny Quest (1964-1965) - an action-adventure based series that ran for one season, with 26 episodes\n\nThe Magilla Gorilla Show (1964-1967) - starring an anthropomorphic gorilla with a bow-tie, shorts and suspenders, that ran for three seasons, with 31 episodes\n\nThe Peter Potamus Show (1964-1967) - for three seasons, with 27 episodes\n\nThe Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show (1965-1967) - with two characters: a superhero ant and a secret agent squirrel, that ran for two seasons, with 52 episodes\n\nWacky Races (1968-1969) - with eleven competing race cars, that aired for one season, with 17 episodes\n\nScooby Doo (1969-1970) - originally for two seasons, with 25 episodes\n\nBased upon some of these cartoon shows, they also produced feature-length films, such as the animated musicals Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! (1964) (H-B's first theatrical film) and The Man Called Flintstone (1966) - a James Bond spoof, the Star Trek-like Jetsons: The Movie (1990), and the live-action Scooby-Doo (2002) (with a sequel in 2004). In the 1980s, one of H-B's most popular animated TV series was The Smurfs (1981-1989), that ran on NBC-TV for 9 seasons, with 256 episodes.\n\nCold War Era Propagandistic Animations:\n\nOne of the most notorious propaganda films ever made, Duck and Cover (1951), was aimed at school children. The 9-minute Civil Defense film used an animated turtle named Bert to show children how to survive a nuclear explosion or atomic attack by using a \"duck and cover\" technique under their desks. Later, Bert became a cultural icon in the documentary The Atomic Cafe (1982), and it was cleverly spoofed in Brad Bird's The Iron Giant (1999) with a cartoon beaver. For its historical and cultural place within film history, it was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2004.\n\nAdvanced Animation Techniques in the 50s and 60s:\n\nRay Harryhausen and Others\n\nIn 1949, inspired by the stop-motion work of Willis O'Brien in King Kong (1933), Ray Harryhausen animated the stop-motion gorilla in Mighty Joe Young (1949), although the work was mostly credited to O'Brien. This was Harryhausen's first feature film for which he created stop-motion animation. His own distinctive brand of stop-motion animation was termed DynaMation - a process involving split-screen rear projection to insert the stop-motion characters into background live-action plates.\n\nRay Harryhausen's films, such as his best known work Jason and the Argonauts (1963) with its skeletal warriors set-piece, perfected stop-motion animation. By the time the 61 year-old Harryhausen had finished Clash of the Titans (1981), he had worked on more than a dozen sci-fi and fantasy films with stop-motion animation. He created the fantastic images in 15 films between 1953 and 1981, including:\n\nTitle Screens Harryhausen's Films Descriptions The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953)\n\nWarner Bros.' prehistoric fantasy - a pre-Godzilla monster story with a rhedosaurus threatening New York City\n\nIt Came From Beneath The Sea (1955)\n\nabout a giant radioactive squid-octopus (with only six arms instead of eight to save money) threatening San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge\n\nEarth vs. The Flying Saucers (1956)\n\nwith flying saucers that destroyed the US capital in the spectacular finale\n\n20 Million Miles to Earth (1957)\n\nwith a threatening reptilian creature threatening Italy\n\nSinbad Trilogy:\n\n(1) The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958)\n\nfeaturing Harryhausen's Dynamation process, including the rescue of a miniature princess (Kathryn Grant) by handsome prince Sinbad (Kerwin Mathews) on his seventh voyage\n\na young genie and many stop-motion animated figures (a giant horned Cyclops who spit-roasted a sailor, a dragon, a snake-woman, and a sword-battling skeleton - the first of his skeletal warriors)\n\n(2) The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974)\n\nfeaturing a 6-armed statue, a one-eyed centaur, and a flying Griffin\n\n(3) Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977)\n\nwith three zomboids, a giant saber-toothed tiger, a horned prehistoric caveman named Troglodyte (Trog for short), three banshees, and Minoton (similar to the legendary Minotaur with a human body and bull's head) - among other creatures\n\nThe 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960)\n\nadapted from Jonathan Swift's novel about an adventurer who encountered the worlds of Lilliput, Brobdignag, and England\n\nMysterious Island (1961)\n\nJules Verne's oft-filmed tale about the ballooning journey of escaped convicts to an uncharted island inhabited by a giant crab and a mysterious Captain Nemo of the Nautilus\n\nJason and the Argonauts (1963)\n\nHarryhausen's best film, with screeching harpies, a giant metal warrior (a cross between the Colossus of Rhodes and a bronzed stone giant Talos man), a 7-headed hydra, and sword-wielding skeletons doing battle against Jason (Todd Armstrong)\n\nFirst Men in the Moon (1964)\n\nthe H.G. Wells' adaptation about a space trip to the lunar surface (with an alien civilization) and back\n\nOne Million Years BC (1966)\n\nHarryhausen's most celebrated film, with Raquel Welch as a fur bikini-clad cavewoman, and a menagerie of prehistoric creatures\n\nThe Valley of Gwangi (1969)\n\nabout the unleashing of a giant, flesh-eating prehistoric monster unearthed by an archaeologist, that burns to death at a church altar in the fiery climax\n\nTrog (1970)\n\na horror-monster film, noted as the last film of Joan Crawford\n\nClash of the Titans (1981)\n\na mythological fantasy, with a memorable snake-haired Gorgon-Medusa, a Cyclops, and the winged horse Pegasus. this was Ray Harryhausen's swan song - his last film as Special Effects producer\n\nOther Famed Animators in the 50s through 70s:\n\nGeorge Pal, the father of screen science fiction fantasy films, artistically combined live acting cinematography, animation, puppets (e.g., Puppetoons produced for Paramount in the 30s), and other visual effects in films such as Tom Thumb (1958), the Cinerama-configured The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1963).\n\nAnimator-geniuses of recent years have used pixillation, the frame by frame animation of live subjects or objects and human beings by filming them incrementally in various fixed poses. Mary Poppins (1964) was a more recent, semi-animated kids musical with both live-action and animated characters.\n\nThe best-known work of the Halas & Batchelor (husband and wife) animation studios was the adult-themed and serious Animal Farm (1954), the first animated color feature film made in England. All of the character's voices were provided by actor Maurice Denham. The allegorical tale, based on George Orwell's 1945 satirical political novel, told of animals at Manor Farm who were led by fascist pigs Napoleon and Snowball to rebelliously overthrow oppressive Farmer Jones, take over the farm, and form a free, egalitarian socialist utopia. The new society was to be based upon seven principles:\n\nWhatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.\n\nWhatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n\nNo animal shall wear clothes.\n\nNo animal shall sleep in a bed.\n\nNo animal shall drink alcohol.\n\nNo animal shall kill any other animal.\n\nAll animals are equal. However, the animals would learn that some animals were more equal than others.\n\n[Note After the success of the 'talking-animal' hit Babe (1995), the film was later remade as the live-action TNT-TV production, Animal Farm (1999). It featured creations of Jim Henson's Creature Shop (where director John Stephenson was a veteran supervisor), animatronics and computer animation.]\n\nA classic family animation with similar animal characters, although a-political, was Charlotte's Web (1973), adapted from E.B. White's beloved tale about an intelligent spider (Charlotte, voiced by Debbie Reynolds), a rat (Templeton, voiced by Paul Lynde), and a bashful, ill-fated barnyard pig (Wilbur, voiced by Henry Gibson). It was noted for Charlotte's sacrificial saving of Wilbur with web-spinning creations (\"Some Pig\"), Wilbur's caring for Charlotte's egg sac and spiderlings upon her death, and memorable songs including \"Mother Earth and Father Time.\""
