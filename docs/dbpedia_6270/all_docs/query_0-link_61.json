        "text": "The Philadelphia Eagles are playing their biggest game in nine years against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, which means we’re long overdue for one of those snarky columns making fun of an opposing team’s city and its fans.\n\nOnly problem is, there’s not much to say about Minneapolis except … it’s cold. Really, really cold. Like, -1 degree cold this past Tuesday night, with snow drifts as tall as skyscrapers and wind chills that can literally rip the flesh from your face. Or something like that.\n\nAs for the people, having visited Minnesota last summer, I can assure you they’re as gosh-darn friendly as their Midwest reputation would have you believe … and I have no doubt they will be extremely warm and hospitable to the throngs of freezing-but-festive Philadelphians who will be invading their state for the Super Bowl in two weeks.\n\nI can’t even say anything about a bitter sports history between the two regions, because there is none. Or if there is, it’s completely one-sided. Teams from Philadelphia and Minnesota have met in the playoffs just five times, with Philly winning them all (three by the Eagles over the Vikings, two by the Flyers over the long-since-departed North Stars).\n\nSo I’m going to have to turn to the world of pop culture and entertainment to drum up a rivalry, with 13 categories that will have zero bearing on the final score, but I’d like to think are fun debate fodder nonetheless …\n\nMTV-era glory\n\nMinneapolis native Prince was a legend, and I won’t dare say a bad word about him. But for all his musical brilliance, he only had five No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Philly’s Hall and Oates had six.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, John Oates’ '80s mustache put Prince’s to shame.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nMall madness\n\nThe Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, brags about being one of the top tourist destinations in the country, but is it really necessary to plop every conceivable form of entertainment into one place? I mean, do we need a full-sized amusement park in the middle of a mall? Like shopping isn’t enough of a headache without oodles of screaming children running around.\n\nAnd for all its braggadocio, the Mall of America actually has less dedicated retail space than the King of Prussia Mall, which has the most of any mall in the country, according to USA Today. And isn’t that the whole purpose of a mall?\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\n1970s sitcoms\n\nNo matter how much I tried to spin it, I couldn’t find any criteria in which “Angie,” which starred Donna Pescow of “Saturday Night Fever” as a Philly coffee shop waitress, tops “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.”\n\nEdge: Minnesota\n\nGeographic-titled '90s movies\n\nAgain, hard to go with the home team on this one. “Philadelphia” (1993) is an emotionally gut-wrenching film that earned Tom Hanks his first of back-to-back Academy Awards and gave us Bruce Springsteen’s Oscar-winning “Streets of Philadelphia.” But the classic dark comedy “Fargo” (1996), which took place predominantly in Minnesota despite its North Dakota-set title, also won two Oscars (best actress for Frances McDormand and best screenplay for the Coen Brothers) and received seven nominations overall (to “Philadelphia’s” five), including best picture.\n\nOn the flip side, “Philadelphia” didn’t try to hide where most of the movie took place with a geographically misleading title. Plus, people in Philly don’t walk around saying “You betcha” or “you’re darn tootin’.”\n\nEdge: Even\n\nWhat’s cooking\n\nFew things taste as good during a football game as a greasy Philly cheesesteak and a warm soft pretzel with mustard.\n\nI’ll take that any day over Minnesota’s specialties: Swedish meatballs (which, let’s face it, you can find at any Ikea) or something called a hotdish, which according to foodnetwork.com, is “a combination of beef or chicken, veggies and canned cream of mushroom soup — traditionally topped with Tater Tots.” I’m sorry, but throwing a bunch of different foods on a plate and giving it the most generic name possible does not a meal make.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nMural of the story\n\nA building in downtown Minneapolis features an impressive mural of Minnesota native Bob Dylan. For Dylan fanatics, it’s a sight to behold. But it’s just one building. Philadelphia has received widespread acclaim for its murals, topping a 2016 thrillist.com ranking of the Best Cities in America for Street Art. Minneapolis or neighboring St. Paul were nowhere to be found.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nPool-hall showdown\n\nPhilly native Willie Mosconi, who was living in Haddon Heights when he died at 80 in 1993, is regarded as the greatest billiards player of all time and easily defeated the trash-talking Minnesota Fats (real name: Rudolf Wanderone) when the two finally met on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports” in 1978.\n\nAnd Minnesota Fats wasn’t even from Minnesota — he was a New Yorker who stole the name from the character Jackie Gleason played in 1959’s “The Hustler.” Mosconi was a technical adviser on the film and also appeared onscreen; Wanderone, meanwhile, was not part of the movie at all but claimed Gleason’s character was based on his life (it wasn’t, according to the author of the book on which the film is based).\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nLate disco-era anthem\n\nIn 1979, Philly’s Sister Sledge gave the world the infectious “We Are Family,” penned by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic. The song would have been a great anthem for any of Philly’s four successful pro sports teams of the era, but unfortunately was pilfered by the Pittsburgh Pirates during their run to a World Series crown.\n\nA year later, Minneapolis-based Lipps Inc. delivered the equally ubiquitous “Funkytown,” which, most people don’t realize, is a song about getting the heck out of Minneapolis, at least judging by the opening line: “Gotta make a move to a town that’s right for me.”\n\nEdge: Since Sister Sledge would never diss its own turf like that, this one goes to Philadelphia.\n\nAnimated favorites from my childhood\n\nI loved \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" as a kid. Even had the board game.\n\nBut not as much as I loved \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,\" starring the two most famous animal residents of the fictional town of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota. I can take off points for the 2000 live-action train wreck with Robert De Niro and Rene Russo, but still, I'd have to pull a rabbit out of my hat to find a reason to vote against the original Rocky and Bullwinkle.\n\nEdge: Minnesota\n\nSanta scandal\n\nFor five decades, Philly has been blasted by the national media as the town that threw snowballs at Santa Claus, an overblown and misleading story that should have died years ago.\n\nIf you really want to talk about a scandalous Santa incident, how 'bout this actual 2014 headline from Gawker.com: “Drunk zombie Santa terrorizes Minnesota family.”\n\nAccording to a report in twincities.com, “An intoxicated stranger dressed as a zombie Santa Claus terrified two teenagers when he entered their St. Paul home.” He ended up throwing up in the house and passing out.\n\nObviously, a drunk zombie Santa from Philly would have done a much better job handling his liquor.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nMisleading nicknames\n\nPhiladelphia is known as the “City of Brotherly Love,” which, I’ll acknowledge, is not always true.\n\nMinnesota, meanwhile, calls itself the “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” In actually, according to the internet, the state has 11,842 lakes that are 10 acres or more, or as many as 15,000, depending on how you define a lake.\n\nIf you’re going to brag like that, you better know how to count.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\n“Saturday Night Live” alum showdown\n\nUpper Darby native Tina Fey created and starred in the hit TV series “30 Rock,” and wrote and appeared in the smash teen comedy “Mean Girls.” Her movies have grossed hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nMinnesota native Al Franken gave us “Stuart Saves His Family.”\n\nTo be fair, Franken did become a United States senator (a position he resigned from this month after allegations of sexual misconduct), which is an impressive achievement, until you remember this is the same state that elected Jesse Ventura governor.\n\nEdge: Philadelphia\n\nSports movie franchises\n\nWe know it’s a cliché to resort to “Rocky,” and we really wanted to avoid it. But when the competition is the “Mighty Ducks” trilogy … On one hand you’ve got a best-picture Oscar winner and one of the most iconic fictional film characters of all time, on the other you’ve got a perfectly mediocre kid-friendly series that was basically the “Bad News Bears” on ice.\n\nAnd if Minnesota, where the story takes place, was so proud of “The Mighty Ducks,” how come the real NHL team with that name ended up 2,000 miles away in Southern California?"
