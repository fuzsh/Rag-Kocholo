        "text": "Rocky and Bullwinkle delighted us as kids. Little did we know they were brainwashing an entire generation to salivate over subversive political satire as adults.\n\nFond memories of the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends were rekindled at the recent death of June Foray, the unique voice behind Rocky the Flying Squirrel, who flew onto TV screens in 1959.\n\nAs an impressionable, but clueless 12-year-old, I was naturally drawn to a show with a quirky rodent, a goofy moose, endless puns and two Russian spies who spun intrigues that invariably and inexplicably backfired.\n\nThis was a time when kids at school underwent Cold War emergency drills, like hiding under our school desks in the event of a nuclear attack. And we never asked why.\n\nDuring the almost five-year run of the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, the main face of Russia, especially during the Cuba missile crisis, was Nikita Khrushchev. He pounded his shoe on a podium and never seemed as clever as the constantly conniving Boris and Natasha. It was disorienting. Were Russians thuggish or sly? Were they dangerous or just annoying?\n\nUpon reflection, Rocky and Bullwinkle were conducting a Cold War parody. The Russians were hapless schemers. We were represented as a hyperactive flying squirrel with a squeaky voice and a moose that was a doofus named after a Berkeley, California car dealer. It hardly seemed like a fair fight. We were by far and away cuter. And clearly luckier.\n\nYou could say kids like me were tricked into watching a cartoon show like Rocky and Bullwinkle. It originally aired on ABC after American Bandstand, which hormone-stoked young guys watched to learn the latest dance steps and ogle leggy girls. (For the record, I was saving myself for Annette Funicello.)\n\nIn a piece for Smithsonian.com, Beth Daniels recounts how the show had a deeper impact that anyone may have realized. Daniels credits Rocky and Bullwinkle for training us to like satire. TV Guide ranked the show as the sixth best TV cartoon show of all time. Try guessing the first five.\n\n“Watching this dumb moose and his rodent pal continually prevail against well-funded human saboteurs gave me pause to consider, even as a kid, that perhaps it is a silly idea to believe that just because we’re the good guys we should always expect to win,” Daniels wrote.\n\nShe dredged up lines from characters on the show, like Senator Fussmussen who declared, “I am against all foreign aid, especially to places like Hawaii and Alaska.” Another senator wanted to raise taxes for everyone up to age 67. He, of course, was 68.\n\nThen there was the episode when Boris and Natasha plotted to spray Congress with “goof gas” – and decided after listening to a congressional debate that gas was unnecessary.\n\nDaniels attributes the layered sophistication of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show to a talented set of writers and voice talents, many of whom had survived the Great Depression, World War II and vaudeville. She said they gave American audiences a form of “backhanded patriotism” – we keep winning, even if we have no idea how.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle cavorted through adventures with a wink of an eye, in contrast to the Howdy Doody Show, with Buffalo Bob and Clarabell the clown (performed original by Bob Keeshan of Captain Kangaroo fame) and specializing in mostly brainless humor.\n\nTo be truthful, I liked both shows, which only overlapped one season in 1959-1960. My parents bought me a Howdy Doody puppet and I begged for a spritz bottle like Clarabell’s. However, like Daniels, I have crisper memories of Rocky and Bullwinkle, not as toys, but as endearing animated characters. And I vividly remember the unrequited machinations of Boris and Natasha.\n\nOf course, the appeal of Rocky and Bullwinkle was a lot like the appeal of Ed Sullivan. They both hosted a variety show. Sullivan had the Beatles. Rocky and Bullwinkle had Mr. Peabody, the genius dog, and his pet boy, Sherman, not to mention Fractured Fairy Tales, Dudley Do-Right and a hip version of Aesop’s Fables, with voices provided by Everett Horton, Hans Conried and Stan Freberg. If your parents were cool, they had albums featuring Freberg sketches of Cold War brinksmanship and parodies of Senator Joseph McCarthy.\n\nFreberg had an Oregon connection. He was hired by the Blitz-Weinhard Brewery to create a musical to celebrate Oregon’s centennial. He composed Oregon! Oregon! A Centennial Fable in Three Acts. It was released in 1959, the same year Rocky and Bullwinkle appeared. Fifty years later, Freberg and Pink Martini collaborated on an updated version of the musical that was performed throughout Oregon.\n\nBullwinkle was more than a satirist. This goofy moose hosted “Bullwinkle’s Corner” where he recited poetry badly and poorly explained how things really worked. In failing to teach anyone anything, Bullwinkle gave us a deep insight into life – You can’t teach what you don’t know.\n\nSome of the subliminal dark humor of Rocky and Bullwinkle can be attributed to the ever-present fear of nuclear annihilation. Most of us still hadn’t come to terms with the concept of MAD – mutual assured destruction. I’m not sure we still have, especially since the leader of North Korea just seems mad.\n\nMaybe we will feel better if we wear Rocky and Bullwinkle costumes to Halloween parties this year.\n\nhttp://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-bullwinkle-taught-kids-sophisticated-political-satire-180964803/#oHxSITt3c8jUFyj7.01"
