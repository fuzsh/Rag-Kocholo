It’s merely obsessive, and highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices, my self-education and my reading. Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to celebrate, and to recommend, a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the numbered list, when it is finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the totals. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same or a similar topic, I will count them all as one entry.\n\nIt’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nWhen I first began to get interested in movies as something other than a pleasurable pastime I was fortunate to do so in the midst of a veritable explosion of interest in old pictures (most of which were, I realize with a shudder, far younger then than I am now) and a concomitant plethora of books about these movies as the so-called “film generation” of the late 1960s began to publish. In early adolescence I began to buy some of these books, and many of them are still in my library. As with anything one discovers in youth, I retain an affection for many of the movie books I encountered then. Since they are all what I consider good books, I feel no need to apologize for their inclusion here. Most of the titles below do reflect the period of my autodidactic education in film, and my current preference for movies of the past over the seemingly computer-conceived, written, directed and performed inanities of this so far appalling century. I have lost interest in new movies generally, and not because I’ve become a cranky old man — I’ll have you know I was a cranky young man — but because movies, at least in America, alienated me (and, I suspect, legions of others) by their nearly complete capitulation to sequels, remakes, comic-book adaptations and idiot comedy, as well as their disinterest in anything recognizably human. (I dunno, Marge. He sounds cranky to me.) (Yeah? Well, in your hat, fellah.)\n\nI. Actors\n\nSince, generally speaking, even the most self-excoriating memoirs are suspect if only because it’s given to very few to express complete honesty about themselves, their experiences or their memories, I tend to prefer biographies. There too, of course, we are at the mercy of expectation, and all too often, hackery. Fortunately, there have been a number of excellent titles, in both biography and memoir and, for lack of a better term, celebration.\n\n1. “Don’t Fall Off the Mountain” Shirley MacLaine (1970)\n\nThe first of MacLaine’s periodic memoirs was also the freshest; here was a simultaneously sincere and sardonic voice, describing not only her early struggles, her mother-of-all-clichés discovery by Hal Wallis, her important roles (she’s especially piquant concerning her unusual research for Irma La Douce) and her travels, particularly in Africa and Tibet. Among the highlights: The day she slapped the closet-case gossip columnist Mike Connolly.\n\nSee also: You Can Get There from Here (1975) in which MacLaine chronicles her trip to China to film the documentary The Other Half of the Sky.\n\nMy Lucky Stars (1996) MacLaine’s acute dissection of the people with whom she’s worked, including what at the time was arguably the most incisive depiction extant of the manic-depressive wonder that was Frank Sinatra. That one cost her a decades-long friendship.\n\n2. Astaire Dancing: The Musical Films John Mueller (1985)\n\nMueller’s is that rare thing: A useful coffee table book. Its author analyses every one of Fred’s dances, whether solo, duet or ensemble, using multiple frames from the pictures for which Astaire created them to illustrate his descriptions. The insights are often superb and if you occasionally disagree with their author (as when he derides both Judy Garland’s affecting emotional reading of Irving Berlin’s “Better Luck Next Time” in Easter Parade, and the song itself) you can still enjoy the pictures, which so lovingly piece together the joys and intricacies of Astaire’s choreography.\n\nA more recent, 25th anniversary edition from Zip Publishing reproduces the frames in far better quality, with those from Astaire’s color pictures now… er… in color.\n\n3. Changing Liv Ullmann (1977)*\n\nA terse, tart, poetic, beautifully written book by a demonstrably great film actress. She is open about her relationship with Ingmar Bergman, revealing about the ways Hollywood attempted to make her a conventional mainstream figure, and amusing about at least one of her co-stars (Charles Bronson). One of the finest such memoirs ever written, in part because for Ullmann, how she tells her story, and what she has to say about it, is as important as the events she recounts from it.\n\n“I have attained one dream – and acquired ten new ones in its place.\n\n“I have seen the reverse side of something that glitters.“\n\n4. The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book Arlene Croce (1972)\n\nAlthough Pauline Kael in her New Yorker review quarreled a bit with some of Croce’s observations she also wrote, “I think it’s perfectly safe to say that this is the best book that will ever be written about Astaire and Rogers.” That may or may not be the case, but nothing I have read in the years since Croce’s book was published has even come close. The founder of Ballet Review magazine, Croce was for a quarter of a century the dance critic for the New Yorker, so she knew her apples. She was also a lively stylist; since reading this book 40-plus years ago I have been unable to watch the “Pick Yourself Up” dance in Swing Time without recalling what Croce wrote about the climax of it.\n\nAs with Astaire Dancing, Zip has also reissued this book with corrections by Croce and sharper frame reproductions.\n\n5. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers Joe Adamson (1973)\n\nSpeaking of published studies that haven’t been bettered, no analysis of the Marx Brothers has approached Adamson’s for breadth, intelligence, erudition or wit… although in 1973 he was pilloried for daring to be funny about the Marxes. This quintessential guide to the greatest of all comedy teams was, with The Marx Brothers Scrapbook (see below) my first exposure to Minnie’s boys, before I ever got to see one of their movies (Animal Crackers, in 1976) and the author’s quotations from the films, especially Groucho’s militantly anti-romantic dialogues with Margaret Dumont, made me weak from laughing. As a result of Adamson’s whetting my appetite for all things Marxist, I couldn’t wait to see the actual pictures, and if that is not the highest benefit of great writing about the movies, I’m not sure what is.\n\nSee also: Groucho Hector Arce (1979) The first biography of the Great Grouch, published just two years after his death, is still, somewhat shockingly, pretty much the only one of note. It’s both well researched and richly detailed; the author was an old friend of and ghost writer for Groucho, his book was authorized and he’d been working on it for years when his subject died.\n\nHarpo Speaks! Harpo Marx with Rowland Barber (1961) Although its author makes too many sneering references to “fags” (not bad for someone who counted Alexander Woollcott as one of his best friends) Harpo’s book is for the most part as charming as the whimsical illustrations prepared for it by his beloved wife Susan.\n\nHello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends Charlotte Chandler (1978) A pleasant, wide-ranging collection of interviews with and about Groucho.\n\nThe Marx Brothers Scrapbook Groucho Marx and Richard J. Anobile (1973) Anobile, whose claim to minor fame was concocting books of frame enlargements with dialogue captions, got Groucho and a number of his friends to sit down for interviews, broken up with photographs, newspaper and magazine clippings and programs from the Marx Brothers’ stage shows and movies. The result was so interesting Groucho sued to stop publication, mostly over his own occasionally blue observations. Best example: The photo caption, for a group portrait of the cast of the Broadway Cocoanuts with a conspicuously empty chair at the center for Chico, who according to Groucho “was too busy fucking or playing pool.”\n\nRaised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho’s House Steve Stoliar (1996) Vincent Canby described The Marx Brothers Scrapbook in his review of it as “funny, sad and revealing.” Stoliar’s memoir is all that and more. The young man who as a college student in the 1970s spearheaded the movement to get Universal to restore and reissue Animal Crackers came to work for Groucho as an archivist and stayed long enough to witness Marx’s companion Erin Fleming’s descent into narcissistic abuse, and Groucho’s own concomitant physical decline, undoubtedly hasted by Fleming’s increasing madness. He was still occasionally as sharp as ever: Toward the end when a nurse said she needed to see whether he had a temperature Groucho replied, “Don’t be silly. Everybody has a temperature.” I hear a movie is to be made of this book, with Geoffrey Rush as Groucho. (Hello, Academy nomination!) I’m sure the sale helped Stoliar’s bank account, but I hope the picture never happens. Why must we be confronted so frequently, not with great movie stars, but with facsimiles?\n\n6. I.E., An Autobiography Mickey Rooney (1965)\n\nI first got wind of this one in an admiring “movie book roundup” article in the late 1970s in the West Coast Review of Books and was surprised by how revealing it sounded of an actor I had scant knowledge of or opinion about beyond having moaned at his staggeringly insensitive caricature of Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany’s and enjoyed his “Let’s put on a show!” montage with Judy Garland in That’s Entertainment! So when a mass-market paperback met my eye in a second-hand book shop not long after, I snapped it up. There is something to be said for writing a memoir when you’re on your uppers; probably Rooney thought he had little to lose in letting down his hair, and although it’s been over four decades since I opened my copy there are a number of passages in it I recall without effort, such as Rooney’s comment on marriage to Ava Gardner (“The quality of [her] womanhood… had pinned me wriggling to a wall”) and L.B. Mayer’s throwing the studio’s one-time box-office savior bodily off the MGM lot for good. Years after reading his book I was unpleasantly surprised by the Rooney interviews in the Turner MGM documentary When the Lion Roared; I had been anticipating his reiterating his litany of complaints about the studio generally (and Mayer specifically) and was nonplussed by his mealy-mouthed, butter-wouldn’t-melt turnabout. Suddenly MGM was a wonderful place, no one at the studio ever hurt Judy Garland, and how dare anyone criticize it, or Mayer? I shouldn’t have been shocked, although I think I was right to be disgusted: This was the ageing Rooney speaking, the rediscovered Rooney, the post-Sugar Babies Rooney — the Rooney who was no longer a has-been but who had become an institution; naturally he had to defend his fellow institutions. While no one else can defend Rooney himself for Mr. Yunioshi, or indeed the young Mickey when he’s behaving almost like a feral Jerry Lewis prototype avant la lettre, like the little girl of fame, when he is good in a movie he is very good indeed. So is his book.\n\n7. John Wayne’s America Garry Wills (1997)\n\nI won’t say Wills’ magisterial study of the 20th century’s most popular American movie star changed my life. That would be absurd. It is, however, perhaps the most influential book about the movies I’ve ever read. It, and a weekend-long AMC film preservation festival of John Ford pictures about 20 years ago re-formed my ideas about Ford and Wayne, and indeed concerning the entire Western genre, about which I had been an appalling snob. My life has been considerably enriched since I invited these men and their movies into it, and I owe much to Wills’ book for relaxing my rigidity. He not only sees his subject plain, but with a fairness that is not sullied by ideological bent; books on Wayne prior to this one tended to be hagiographic, and written by either hacks or love-it-or-leave-it types, or both. Wayne for Wills is not the monolithic figure of rectitude favored by those who share the late movie star’s politics nor the hateful bugbear of left-liberalism but a man of strong gifts and beliefs, and equally strong contradictions and flaws. Wills brings a thoughtfulness to his subject that verges on, if it does not spill over into, genuine profundity.\n\n8. The Laurel and Hardy Book Leonard Maltin, editor (1973)\n\nThis was the earliest movie book I ever purchased, at around age 12, and that copy is still in my collection. (And still in surprisingly good condition, all things considered). A nearly perfect pocket history of L & H, the book provides a complete filmography, including extensive lists of the dozens of shorts Stan and Babe made before their teaming, accounts of the filming of specific titles, and knowledgeable chapters celebrating the recurrent character actors (James Finlayson, Charley Chase. Arthur Housman, Charlie Hall) whose appearances were so indelible a part of Laurel&Hardyland. The Curtis Film Series was one of the happiest paperback events of the early 1970s, with, among other things, several titles written and/or edited by Maltin on child stars and character actors (The Reel Stars) as well as individual volumes on Boris Karloff, Don Siegel and Preston Sturges. About the only complaint one could lodge against the series was that the paper Curtis chose for it rendered the many photographs in each book notably fuzzy. (In the same period Curtis also produced mass market reprints, in conjunction with the Broadway musical olio Lorelei, of Anita Loos’ Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes with, alas, poor facsimiles of Ralph Barton’s wonderful illustrations.) Naturally, the Curtis Film Series was a good thing that couldn’t last long; the publisher closed up shop in 1974.\n\nSee also: Mr. Laurel & Mr. Hardy: An Affectionate Biography of Laurel and Hardy John McCabe, Introduction by Dick Van Dyke (1966) The subtitle says it all. McCabe spent much of a lifetime researching and writing about L & H. He also established the international Sons of the Desert society for L&H aficionados. I don’t know how I neglected this lovely book on the first go-’round, but thanks to Eliot M. Camarena for the reminder!\n\nStan and Ollie: The Roots Of Comedy – The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy Simon Louvish (2001), which delves deeply into Stan’s extensive creative input, for better or worse, into the comedies he made with Babe Hardy.\n\n9. Montgomery Clift Patricia Bosworth (1980)\n\nBosworth — her surname so appropriately close to Boswell — was an incisive, sympathetic biographer, which God knows Clift needed. She presents him in all his contradictory glory and effectively (if depressingly) limns Clift’s precipitous personal decline following his disfiguring 1955 automobile accident. For a man who from adolescence habitually stared at himself in mirrors, not merely in narcissism but apparently out of lust, losing his vaunted looks was a massive blow to Clift’s psyche. (Montgomery Clift makes it clear that, while Monty was bisexual, his chief attraction was to men.) That he was one of the most beautiful men ever to have been photographed by a movie camera is self-evident. That he brought a new style of acting to the screen, before Brando, and a remarkable sensitivity to his performances, has been largely forgotten. Bosworth reminds you why Clift was important.\n\nSee also: Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman (2011) Bosworth was a nearly lifelong friend to Fonda, and wrote what is, as far as I am aware, the most unflinching and honest portrait of her. Despite her having given some superb performances including what I maintain is the finest film portrayal of the last 50 years, the woman herself has long seemed to me confused to the point of needing professional help. Who else, in the turbulent 1960s, had to deliberately seek out a cause about which to concern herself (because everyone else had one) when they were practically growing on trees? Further, who, having finally decided on Vietnam as her cause, allowed herself to be manipulated into being photographed, laughing, with anti-aircraft machinery by the nation against which, whatever you think of that stinking conflict, her country was at war? Fonda’s family was practically the textbook example of dysfunctional, yet she has spent much of her life searching for a Daddy surrogate and marrying one after another. And while she considers herself a feminist, moreover, Fonda routinely pays the men who work for her more than the women. She is, in short, and for all her thespic gifts, exceptionally reactionary, even for Hollywood. Bosworth cannot tell you exactly why Fonda behaves as she does, but she gets the details down in all their painful prolificacy. After reading her book I still admire Jane Fonda the screen actress; I’d be a fool not to. But Fonda the woman sends shivers of despair up my spine.\n\n10. Who the Hell’s In It: Portraits and Conversations Peter Bogdanovich (2004)\n\nForty years’ worth of appreciations of and interviews with several of the most durable of film stars, conducted by a man besotted by the movies. Although Bogdanovich could be repetitious (take a drink each time he writes that some couple or other “fell in love”) and a bit narrow-minded (no one he admired , even Cary Grant, could ever be anything other than absolutely heterosexual, even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary) this is by and large a splendid collection.\n\nSee also: Pieces of Time: Peter Bogdanovich on the Movies (1973) A few of the chapters in Who the Hell’s In it appeared first in this smaller volume of Bogdanovich’s magazine writing and which includes a fascinating view of John Ford filming Cheyenne Autumn on location and a memorable interview with James Stewart in which the man I consider the finest of all American movie actors gave his interviewer his book’s title.\n\nII. Animation\n\nFor nearly as long as I can remember, I have been under the spell of animated cartoons. As a child I was mad about them, more so than about any other form of filmed (or broadcast) entertainment, and much more so than anyone else I knew of my own age and weight. This extended to the comic books I also came under the thrall of even before I began to read on my own. I was an inveterate “funny animal” reader; Tom and Jerry and Bugs Bunny reprints, the Paul Murray Mickey Mouse and Goofy adventures and the Carl Barks duck stories were my meat, and the only humans who entered my comics universe were Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam, a few of the Harvey characters (and most of them were ghosts or imps) and, especially, the miraculous Little Lulu. I had no interest in superheroes then, and have little now.\n\nBut I see I’ve strayed from my text. Herewith a few of what I consider the best books on the animated cartoon.\n\n11. The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons Jerry Beck (2010; reprinted 2020)\n\nA terrific little book buttressed by hundreds of cell reproductions. You can argue with the choices, but fortunately the rankings are alphabetical rather than numerical. What’s Opera, Doc? isn’t the greatest cartoon ever made just because people keep saying it is; it’s not even the best Chuck Jones cartoon. But then, Citizen Kane isn’t Orson Welles’ best movie either, let alone the greatest ever made, and that pointless debate has gone on for decades.\n\nMy only real quarrel with Beck’s book: Why are the titles of these cartoon shorts listed as “Episodes”? Why don’t words mean what they mean any longer?\n\n12. Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare Joe Adamson (1990)\n\nAdamson, one of the best things to happen to the study of classic movie comedy, turns his attention to the greatest of all cartoon stars. The book is not only beautifully laid out but wonderfully written, from its punning subtitle to the witty captions for the illustrations.\n\nSee also: Goofy: The Good Sport Walt Disney Studios (1985) Although this one suffers a bit from the way the studio was pushing “Sport Goofy” as a brand in the mid-’80s, it’s a nice little volume that pays tribute to my favorite animated cartoon character other than Bugs.\n\nI Tawt I Taw a Putty Tat: Fifty Years of Sylvester and Tweety Jerry Beck (1991) A nice volume on the adversarial team. Both characters were created, separately, by Bob Clampett, but redefined and put together by Friz Freleng for his peerless series of visual gag shorts.\n\n13. Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist Chuck Jones (1989)\n\nNo creative artist has given me more pleasure throughout my life than Charles M. Jones. (Desert island cartoon: The Rabbit of Seville.) His thoughtfulness, erudition, wit and self-reflection made him a uniquely literary figure among animators. They could also overlard his later work with far too much philosophical verbosity. But these attributes were decided assets when he came to write his lavishly illustrated memoirs. Chuck Amuck was my favorite new book of its year, the volume I’d been pining for most of my life without knowing it.\n\nSee also: Chuck Jones: A Flurry of Drawings Hugh Kenner (1994) This bright, intelligently written little monograph is a worthy addition to Jonesiana.\n\nChuck Redux: Drawing from the Fun Side of Life Chuck Jones (1996) Not as great a book as its predecessor, but well worth savoring.\n\n14. Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson (1984)\n\nTwo of Walt Disney’s “Nine Old Men” of animation, Thomas and Johnson were also best friends, next-door neighbors, beloved instructors for younger animators and authors of numerous informative books on the craft. This is their finest work, a rich, and richly illustrated, guide to Disney’s achievement. Thomas and Johnson (universally known at Disney as “Frank and Ollie”) were also masters at the art of character, or personality, animation; separately and together they were responsible for some of the loveliest sequences in feature animation: Ollie animated Smee in Peter Pan, the Stepsisters in Cinderella, Icabod Crane in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, King John in Robin Hood and, with Thomas, a great deal of The Jungle Book while Frank animated the dwarves weeping over Snow White’s coffin, Pinocchio’s performance of “No Strings on Me,” Cinderella‘s Stepmother, Captain Hook in Peter Pan, the wizard’s duel in The Sword in the Stone, Mary Poppins‘ dancing penguins, much of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet for the early featurettes and, supremely, the beautiful scene of Lady and Tramp eating spaghetti and exchanging an unexpected kiss. Whether evoking the movement of the natural world is or should be the ultimate goal of animation is highly debatable — Tex Avery’s cartoons don’t give a damn for reality, and there are none funnier — but there is no denying that the Disney artists in their full-length features approximated it better than anyone else. This treasurable volume shows you how.\n\nWhile DVDs fall outside the purview of this survey, I also recommend the lovely 1999 documentary Frank & Ollie without reservation.\n\nSee also: Too Funny for Words: Disney’s Greatest Sight Gags Thomas and Johnson (1987) Thomas once recounted Walt at a story conference complaining, “You guys all think that the world is made up of gags! There isn’t one of you left who could write a lullaby or a love-affair romance in a picture, you all want gags, gags, gags!” Fortunately, most of those gags were good, many were brilliant and quite a few were masterful.\n\nTreasures of Disney Animation Art Walton Rawls, ed. (1982) Not merely a quintessential coffee table book, but practically the size of a piece of furniture.\n\nWalt Disney’s Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation John Canemaker (2001) A beautiful tribute, by a man who is not only an historian of the subject but an animator himself, of the master animators and animation directors on whom Walt relied, more and more as he became distracted by theme parks and other diversions: Les Clark, Marc Davis, Ollie Johnston, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Wolfgang (“Woolie”) Reitherman and Frank Thomas.\n\nWalt Disney and Assorted Other Characters: An Unauthorized Account of the Early Years at Disney’s Jack Kinney (1988) Kinney worked as an animator at the Walt Disney studios from 1932, eventually becoming the director of the great Goofy shorts (which no less an authority than Roger Rabbit called “genius”) in 1940. His book is a fascinating glimpse of the studio in its heyday, written with what one senses is a well-natured, and well-earned, bitterness: Kinney was offered the spot at MGM which Tex Avery eventually accepted, and was foolish enough to ask Walt’s advice about whether he should take it. Disney never forgave him for thinking about leaving. It took nearly 20 years but he finally edged Kinney out in 1958.\n\n15. The Fleischer Story: A History of the Max Fleischer Cartoon Studio in the Golden Age of Film Animation, 1920-1942 Leslie Cabarga (1976; reissued 1988)\n\nThe first study of the Fleischers, by a writer and graphic designer who has become renowned for his own beautifully airbrushed Betty Boop art. From the silent Koko the Klown series Out of the Inkwell (revamped in the early 1960s and familiar to kids of my generation from TV syndication) to Betty to Popeye to the ill-advised feature pictures and Max’s horrific betrayal by Paramount which took everything he’d built up away from him forever. It’s all here, wonderfully illustrated and told with a sense both of excitement and regret.\n\n16. Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age Michael Barrier (1999)\n\nThere have been other overviews of animation, many of them with finer illustrations (see below) but none has had both the grasp of film history and developed sense of aesthetics Barrier displays in this tour de force volume. The author can be prickly, and more than a tick conservative, but this book, his superb critical study of Carl Barks and his marvelous overview Funnybooks: The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books constitute a masterwork trilogy of rigorously intelligent popular history.\n\nSee also: Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation Charles Solomon (1989; Revised and Updated in 1994) A glorious brick of a book surveying the entirety of animation history to the early ’90s and bursting with beautiful illustrations, many in color.\n\nWild Minds: The Artists and Rivalries That Inspired the Golden Age of Animation Reid Mitenbuler (2020) There’s very little that is either new or revelatory in this breezy chronicle, but it’s a very enjoyable (and, rara avis these days, well-written) concise history of the genre.\n\n17. Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons Leonard Maltin (Revised and Updated, 1980)\n\nAs a movie critic Maltin has been negligible. His taste tends to the middle-brow and, like a good liberal, he was slow to accept the emergence of serious movies by and about gay men and Lesbians. It is as a movie historian, therefore, that he has been of value, and this book is one of his finest, perhaps because (as with Joe Adamson) animation is clearly an abiding passion of its author. You’ll find here a survey of all the important animation studios and practitioners, from Winsor McKay to Ralph Bakshi, with complete filmographies for each, delicious illustrations, amusing captions and trenchant observations. This is one volume that belongs in every library of worthwhile movie books; when the revised edition appeared in 1980 I felt as if I’d been waiting for it my whole life.\n\nSee also: The Disney Films Leonard Maltin (1973; updated numerous times to 2000) A lively, well-illustrated critical guide, written with an historian’s knowledge and an enthusiast’s delight.\n\n18. Pinocchio (Disney Editions Deluxe) Pierre Lambert (1997)\n\nA dazzling visual portrait of my favorite animated movie. If I were forced, in some nightmare scenario, to keep only a single book on animation it would be this one. 236 glorious pages of backgrounds, sketches and finished cels. I hate even to acknowledge the existence of that degraded rag Entertainment Weekly (or, as it is known in my home, “EW!”) but this excerpt from the magazine’s review, posted on Amazon, sums the book up well: “[Lambert’s] exegesis of which artists did what… and of how their individual strengths were matched to particular characters and scenes… is invaluable. So is the fact that this book enshrines the fullest flowering of a medium increasingly overtaken by marketing concerns.”\n\nSee also: Pinocchio: The Making of the Disney Epic J.B. Kaufman (2015) More prosaic, and less lush, than Lambert’s book, but a thorough and respectable recounting of the making of a genuine animated masterpiece.\n\n19. Tex Avery: King of Cartoons Joe Adamson (1975)\n\nI owe my veneration of Tex Avery’s peerless MGM cartoons to a friend who videotaped and shared them with me in the early 1980s; due to the vagaries of syndication (and our family’s not having cable television after 1971) I had never seen them. I’m not sure I’d even heard Avery’s name at the time. Only animators, and hardcore animation fans, seemed to know who he was when Adamson wrote his, so far unequalled, appreciation. How he had time to interview Avery (and his best writer, Heck Allen — Mike Maltese to Avery’s Chuck Jones), see all the shorts, select his frame blow-ups and write this treasurable volume only two brief years after publishing Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo, I can’t imagine. I will, however, be eternally grateful he did.\n\nSee also: “I Say, I Say… Son!”: A Tribute to the Legendary Animators Bob, Chuck and Tom McKimson Robert McKimson, Jr. (2012) A pleasant illustrated group biography on the least interesting of the six great Warner Bros. directors (the others were Avery, Freleng, Bob Clampett, Jones and, all too briefly, Arthur Davis) but one of its finest animators (Robert) as well as his gifted draftsman brothers (Chuck and Tom). Bob McKimson was often inspired, especially in his distinctive style, as an animator, of gesture. If his shorts as a director are less brilliant than those by Jones, Freleng and Clampett, he developed Foghorn Leghorn and Sylvester, Jr. (“Oh, father! How can I ever face the fellowth in Troop 12?”) and created Jack Warner’s favorite, the Tasmanian Devil. Doesn’t that just figure?\n\nNow, can we please have a moratorium on the word “legendary” unless the subject under discussion is Mt. Olympus, the Nibelungenlied or King Arthur’s knights?\n\nAnimation: The Art of Friz Freleng — Volume One Friz Freleng and David Weber (1994) I have never understood why Freleng, whom Chuck Jones considered one of the two certified geniuses with whom he had worked (the other was Avery) is not spoken of with the same reverence as that which now routinely greets the name of Bob Clampett. I suspect on one level it’s because his work was considered conventional; Freleng was less concerned with exploring great graphic design or cinematic technique than he was in creating strong characters and explicating physical gags. Freleng’s comedic gags are of a consistently high order, even in his lesser cartoons, and his best work makes me laugh harder than almost anything other than Jones’ and Avery’s masterpieces. This two-volume, numbered and slip-cased set, signed by Freleng, includes an audio and a video cassette and is heaven for the Freleng fanatic. What makes Freleng so treasurable, as I see it, is his relentless logic. When he sets up an elaborate gag sequence, the payoff is both inevitable and surreal. One example of many, from the brilliant Bad Ol’ Puddy Tat: After being ingested by Sylvester, Tweety takes over his body, turning him into a train and, with perfect cartoon logic, crashes the cat straight into a brick wall.\n\nTex Avery: The MGM Years, 1942-1955 John Canemaker (1996) If Adamson’s Avery book has a liability it’s that none of his illustrations is in color.

Richter and the director Jean-Claude Tramont starring Gene Hackman and Barbra Streisand.\n\nThe Quiller Memorandum (1966) A diminution by Harold Pinter of the exceptionally intelligent and beautifully written thriller by Elleston Trevor, writing as “Adam Hall,” that while not entirely successful is nevertheless fascinating to watch, if only for its glimpses of 1960s Berlin. (The sheer number of shiny Volkswagon Beetles on the streets is a whole movie in itself.) The picture is almost fatally flawed by its central casting, which makes absolutely no sense; I’m more or less a lifelong admirer of George Segal, but Quiller is British or he’s nothing. Although I have no quarrels with Segal’s performance, instead of concentrating on Quiller’s actions we’re distracted wondering why MI6 is assigning top secret investigations to an American. Much of the dialogue in the Pinter screenplay is Trevor’s but what’s missing is Quiller’s narration, crucial in the novel, where he takes the reader through his attempts to smoke out a resurgent Nazi organization. We share his confusion and suspicions, as well as his plans and strategies, in a way we do not in the movie and cannot as it was written and filmed. As with The Ipcress File, the producers of The Quiller Memorandum bought a complex, witty novel and boiled it down to an essence; the flavor is there, faintly, but the dish itself has been so adulterated it scarcely resembles the original. What, exactly, was the point?\n\nI am well aware that of course the point was to cash in on the ’60s mania for spies. So why not cast an English actor? After all, the period in which The Quiller Memorandum was made was also a period of mania for everything British. Nearly every element of Trevor’s book was simplified or, conversely, made needlessly complex, although I appreciate Pinter’s ironic use of the Olympiastadion in the opening scene. The climax is also good, as are the torture sequences between Segal and the silky, seductive SS mastermind wonderfully embodied by Max von Sydow and the long nocturnal pursuit of Segal through the Berlin streets. These sequences are effective primarily because they follow the action of the novel; they were too good not to use. (Trevor may or may not have known it, but his book is based on a fallacy: That the British government would be concerned with foiling renascent National Socialists when, like its American and Soviet counterparts, the Empire after the fall of Berlin jockeyed to grab as many Nazi scientists as it could.) Michael Anderson, the director, whose best movie was the Michael Todd Around the World in 80 Days, kept the picture trim and the action humming, abetted by Erwin Hillier’s beautiful widescreen cinematography, which reaches its apotheosis in an exhilarating driving sequence clearly filmed without recourse to rear-screen projection. Alec Guinness contributes one of his small, quiet gems as a superficially friendly yet oddly sinister MI6 section head, Senta Berger is lovely as a woman who knows more than she’s telling, and George Sanders and Robert Helpmann are amusing in roles that are all too brief. Trevor, by the way, wrote 78 novels (including The Flight of the Phoenix and 19 additional Quillers), 33 children’s books, 6 stage plays and 15 radio plays between 1943 and 1996. Not a patch on Barbara Cartland (723) or Isaac Asimov (500+) but impressive nonetheless.\n\nA Life at Stake (1955) A cheaply made B-movie thriller from Angela Lansbury’s lean years, seemingly lost and recently rediscovered. It’s a variation on Double Indemnity, with Lansbury in the Stanwyck role and Keith Andes as the man she and her disreputable creep of a husband (Douglass Dumbrille) hope to lure into a business arrangement and then murder for his insurance. Lansbury plays it far more ambivalently than Stanwyck was allowed to, although one’s first instincts about her character support the notion that she’s not quite what she seems. The direction by Paul Guilfoyle is serviceable but the script by Russ Bender, from a story by Hank McCune, is a cut above the norm, intelligent and often lively, especially the lines for Andes’ busybody of a landlady, marvelously played by Jane Darwell. Andes gets to show off his physique on a regular basis, which seems to be the reason he was hired, but Claudia Barrett is fascinatingly off-center as Lansbury’s younger sister; we’re never quite sure if she’s delightfully daffy, smarter than she seems or a genuine dingbat.\n\nA Life at Stake is not a classic by any means but it’s a reasonably diverting use of 76 minutes, and more than that if you like Lansbury. She was seldom given the screen roles she deserved, but she’s been a favorite with me since I first saw her in Bedknobs and Broomsticks at the theaters when I was 11 and The Manchurian Candidate on television two years later. Her distinctive voice is one I always enjoy hearing, even in movies that aren’t entirely worthy of her.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (1961) The famous adaptation by George Axelrod (screenplay) and Blake Edwards (direction) has become genuinely iconic — a word I seldom use since everyone else over-uses it — for Audrey Hepburn’s look, especially during her early morning embodiment of the title.\n\nTrue Grit (1969) The spirited adaptation of Charles Portis’ superb novel, with a canny central performance by John Wayne.\n\nThe President’s Analyst (1967) The writer-director Theodore Flicker’s great, hilarious satire on spies, liberal pieties, reactionary politics, psychoanalysis and government secrecy seems ever more relevant, and prescient.\n\nThe Shootist (1976) John Wayne’s final movie is a good picture irredeemably flawed by its star’s interference in the creative process. Since Wayne expressed strong interest in the project early on, he ought to have had enough faith in the material, and sufficient personal integrity, to see it through as written. Glendon Swarthout’s novel, about a notorious gunfighter facing his imminent death from rectal cancer, is a remarkable little book, clear-eyed and entirely unsentimental. As long as the picture sticks to Swarthout’s narrative, it’s restrained, taut and elegiac. Unfortunately, Wayne had script approval, and that meant dulling the novel’s hard edge to the movie’s detriment.\n\nOne of the book’s most extraordinary qualities is one that could not be transmogrified to film without a great deal of creativity: The way Swarthout anatomizes (if you’ll forgive a wholly appropriate pun) the effects of gun violence on the human body. Each time a character is shot, the author describes in clinical detail what the bullet does to his flesh, and his internal organs. It’s almost the literary equivalent of Sam Peckinpah’s balletic violence; it reminds the reader how transient life is, and how easily extinguished. I doubt there was a way, in 1976, to depict this in a motion picture the way in our own era the various “CSI” series showed it in nearly every episode. In any case, the loss of this is less egregious than the way two primary elements were altered: The ending, and the character of the teenage boy played by Ron Howard. In the Swarthout novel Gillom Rogers is a thoroughgoing delinquent, so viciously selfish he steals the guns from a dead man’s hands and the money left for his poor, widowed mother by the gunfighter. The movie paints Gillom as a nice lad angry about his father’s death who might go bad without guidance. And need I add that he does the right thing at the end? It’s all as phony as Wayne’s spurious claim, when he saw footage filmed during his absence that indicated the gunfighter shot one of his assailants in the back, that he’d never done such a thing before in any movie. (He had; he still demanded re-takes.)\n\nAlthough he is altogether too hale and bulky to be believable as a man who is wasting away from disease, and there is in the picture no cinematic equivalent of the harrowing moment when the gunfighter, John Books, sees the mirror reflection of his final terminal state — much less his deliberately shooting a would-be thief in the gut and a failed assassin up the ass, as if in revenge for the site of his own cancer — Wayne gives a good account of the man. (A further criticism: He’s much too old for his role, as Lauren Bacall is for hers.) Although Ron Howard’s performance as Gillom is quite good, the part is so compromised it feels like something out of a TV movie of the week instead of emerging from one of the toughest Western novels ever written. (Despite his immature voice, I think Howard underrated as an actor. It’s only as a director that he drives me onto the shoals of despair.)\n\nWhat’s best about the movie, aside from Howard and Wayne, Bruce Surtees’ autumnal cinematography and Elmer Bernstein’s threnodic score, is what’s also best about the book: The way, sniffing his death, everyone except his doctor (James Stewart) and the Bacall character flocks around to pick what it can off John Books’ still-living corpse: The bantam-weight town marshal (played with malicious glee by Harry Morgan), who is delighted to lose a source of violence; the reporter for a local paper (Rick Lenz) who sees Books as his ticket to better things; the undertaker (John Carradine, another living cadaver) who will charge the gawkers to view the body; Books’ old girlfriend (Sheree North) who hopes to parlay marriage into a tell-all memoir; the blacksmith (Scatman Crothers) who gets Books’ horse and saddle for a song; the fast-shooting faro dealer (Hugh O’Brian) hoping to make a name for himself; an old foe (Richard Boone) out for vengeance; and even the little barber (Alfred Dennis) who surreptitiously sweeps up Books’ fallen locks to sell as souvenirs. These various ghouls and carrion birds confirm Books’ cynicism, and inadvertently provide him an idea for how to die without agony. All these actors are fine, but Stewart is better than good. I don’t know whether he read Swarthout’s novel, if the screenwriters (Miles Hood Swarthout and Scott Hale) noted the doctor’s attitude in their script, or if the director, Don Siegel, instructed Stewart to do so, but the actor reads his lines with real anger, as if the doctor is so disgusted with death, and the process of dying, he almost seems to be taking it out on the patient.\n\nStagecoach (1939) John Ford’s influential Western, his first since 3 Bad Men in 1926 and the single title that redefined the contours of the genre. Adapted by Dudley Nichols from Ernest Haycox’s well-written magazine story “The Stage to Lordsburg” (with perhaps a trace of de Maupassant’s “Boule de Suif” thrown in) Stagecoach tossed out most of the childish Western clichés and enhanced its story with flesh-and-blood characters rather than mere traditional archetypes. Many have deemed the result “Grand Hotel on Wheels” but this is inapt. In Grand Hotel, most of the characters never meet the others. Here the people are thrust together, mostly in the confined space of a carriage racing across the desert. They could scarcely be more intimate with each other if they were sharing a bed. Although the conniving banker is an all too hissable villain, especially as overplayed by Berton Churchill and I think it’s asking a bit much of any audience to expect it to believe a woman about to give birth could successfully hide her advanced state of pregnancy in such close quarters, the rest of the people, and their behavior, seem perfectly true to life: The physician whose confidence has been destroyed by drink (Thomas Mitchell), the prostitute frozen out by the other passengers (Claire Trevor), the phony Southern gentleman-gambler (John Carradine), the stalwart Belle of the Old South (Louise Platt), the jovial coward of a driver (Andy Devine) and the timid milquetoast of a whiskey drummer (the all-too appropriately named Donald Meek). Only George Bancroft as the marshal riding shotgun is out of his depth but you forgive him for his general likeability.\n\nAfter toiling for nearly a decade in six-day Western quickies in part as expiation for the sin of appearing in another director’s movie, John Wayne was finally resurrected by Ford as the escaped prisoner the Ringo Kid, and no filmmaker could have more boldly announced his intention to introduce a new star than when Ford dollies in for a rare (for him) close-up of Wayne as he hails the stagecoach. Although Wayne’s face had matured from the time of The Big Trail in 1930 and he’d gained in technique through all those B- and C-grade Westerns for Columbia, Monogram and Republic, he’s still a bit callow here. Yet you hardly mind, particularly as he’s so innocently solicitous of Claire Trevor, not seeming to know why the other passengers shun her, or not caring. The other men pretend to be gentlemen but treat this woman as less than human; Wayne’s rough gunslinger and Mitchell’s bibulous outcast physician are the only real gentlemen in the bunch.\n\nShot by the great Bert Glennon against the heart-stopping vistas of Monument Valley, the backdrops in Stagecoach occasionally dwarf the human participants in a way I don’t think had ever been seen in a movie before this one. Glennon’s exterior shots are like Ansel Adams portraits come to vivid life, and on the screen in 1939 those magnificent huge skies and towering mesas must have knocked Depression audiences out. Certainly they reflect the eye of a visual poet, which for all his self-conscious bluster is what John Ford was. He made barrenness sing.\n\nHorse Feathers (1932) The Marx Brothers’ funniest comedy. The laughter is sustained throughout, and if the climactic football game is a bit of a let-down (why hire the Marx Brothers to do what the Three Stooges can?)* the rest of the picture, from Groucho’s Gilbertian introduction (“I’m Against It!”) to the surprise finale with Thelma Todd, is roaringly funny, and in a way only those American movies that just skirted enforcement of the Production Code can be. The hilarious screenplay is by S. J. Perelman, Bert Kalmar & Harry Ruby and Will B. Johnstone, with an un-credited assist from Arthur Sheekman, one of Groucho’s favorite writers. Kalmar & Ruby also wrote the songs, and one of the picture’s highlights is the different versions of “Everyone Says I Love You” they wrote for Zeppo’s Crosbyesque crooning, Chico’s fractured English, and Groucho’s cynicism (“Everyone says I love you/But just what they say it for I never knew/It’s just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who/Says I love you…”) Indeed, the rowboat scene in which he sings it to Todd, to his own charming guitar accompaniment, is the movie’s highest spot. He serenades while she (of course) does the rowing, and what makes Todd’s attempts to wrangle secret football plays from Groucho so memorable is their ingenious by-play: When she engages in baby-talk, he threatens to kick her teeth down her throat. This is the second of two pictures in which Todd appeared as Groucho’s comic/romantic foil, and you wish there had been more. They’re so evenly matched that by contrast his sniping at poor Margaret Dumont almost seems like a come-down. Almost.\n\nIf you care about such things, Norman Z. McLeod directed.\n\n*And yes, I know the Stooges weren’t in pictures then. If I had said Wheeler and Woolsey would you have known who I meant?\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote the First: Although I have endeavored to post these capsule review collections as close to the first of each month as possible, I a) have a full-time job, hence a limited amount of time to write; and b) have been finding it harder and harder to concentrate on that writing. The wholesale insanity of the last 18 months; of my mayor and governor and county commissioners using a manufactured viral outbreak as the excuse they’ve been waiting for, presumably all their lives, to behave like would-be dictators; of seeing a sociopathic hack hailed as American’s Doctor™, medical science and sensible care turned on their heads as if the entire world had fallen down the rabbit hole after Alice; a demented old bigot installed in the Oval Office and self-anointed tech billionaire health czars blithely informing us we will likely be “locked down” for years; and of the constant harassment over useless masks and applied duress requiring I either risk my future health by taking an experimental gene therapy masquerading as a vaccine, submit to weekly tests and disclose my health status to my employers in violation of HIPPA laws, or lose my job… these and related stresses have conspired to sap what little mental, physical and emotional energy I have, leaving very little for creative activity. But then, I strongly suspect that driving us all nuts is part of the plan; even jolly old “Santa Klaus” Schwab, who should know, let it slip last year that we are in the midst of “the world’s biggest psychological experiment.” After a year and a half of this psychic pressure, I’m lucky I can write my own name, let alone a monthly digest of coherent critical thought.\n\nNote the Second: As always, click on the highlighted text for links.\n\nFail-Safe (1964) A quietly terrifying adaptation by the screenwriter Walter Bernstein and the director Sidney Lumet of the remarkable Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler nuclear-nightmare novel with a superb cast headed by Henry Fonda, Walter Matthau, Dan O’Herlihy, Fritz Weaver, Larry Hagman and Frank Overton.\n\nCharley Varrick (1973) A smart, tough crime drama directed by Don Siegel featuring a strong central performance by Walter Matthau. The tight screenplay by Dean Riesner and Howard A. Rodman was adapted from The Looters, a fast, violent little pulp novel by John H. Reese which is even more brutal than the movie: Charley, the older of the two robbers who pull off a bank heist whose proceeds are unexpectedly stuffed with Mafia money, is not only a nasty piece of work in himself but dies horribly at the hands of a psychotic Southern cracker hitman long before the story is finished. The movie Charley is nearly as gruff as his literary coeval but not as ruthless, although he does set up his problematic young partner (Andy Robinson) for possible death at his own hands. Siegel, who literally signed this in the credits as “A Siegel Film,” keeps the action rolling and the violence, while not excessive, disturbing. He’s abetted in this by his screenwriters and by Michael C. Butler’s beautifully rendered widescreen cinematography, Frank Morriss’ effective editing and a taut score by Lao Schifrin with a pulsating, agitated main theme that perfectly encapsulates the picture’s mounting tension. Although Reisner and Rodman used very little of Reese’s novel, which jumps from one character to another in a way that illuminates all of them without digressing from the narrative, they seized on one of its peripheral aspects, to excellent effect: Charley’s crop-dusting business, with its slogan “The Last of the Independents.” (Siegel was so enamored of that he wanted to name the movie after it but was overriden by Universal.) They also used Charley’s piloting, and his past as a barnstormer, to neat affect at the end. Interestingly, their finale was echoed later in Brian Garfield’s book Hopscotch, which in its turn made a memorable vehicle… for Walter Matthau.\n\nMoviegoers of 1973, who had perhaps forgotten that Matthau had a long history of dramatic roles in addition to his peerless way with comedy, might have been surprised by his superb performance here… if they saw it; the picture was a flop at the box office. Robinson, the Zodiac knock-off killer of the atrocious Dirty Harry, sometimes seems to be reprising that performance, the way Steve Railsback couldn’t quite shed Charlie Manson in The Stunt Man. Joe Don Baker is appropriately mercurial as the hitman and the good supporting cast includes John Vernon as the shady bank president; Woodrow Parfrey as his prissy manager; Felicia Farr (the wife of Matthau’s best friend Jack Lemmon) as a secretary with secrets she’s willing to share with Charley along with her bed; Norman Fell as an FBI agent; William Schallert as a small-town sheriff; Benson Fong as a Chinese gangster; Jacqueline Scott as Charley’s doomed wife; Marjorie Bennett as his nosy old trailer park neighbor avidly and with delighted relish assuring anyone who’ll listen that she just knows rapists are after her; and the marvelous Tom Tully as a pawnbroker in a wheelchair who gets a memorable demise. The best performance aside from Matthau’s is that of Sheree North as a cool, savvy photographic forger. What North does with the character is astonishing; she takes an interesting small role and turns it into a complete human being, with an inner life and, for all I know, a soul. And to think that if she’s remembered at all it’s as a plate of 1950s cheesecake.\n\nSecond Chorus (1940) Fred Astaire famously referred to this as “the worst film [he] ever made.” I assume he meant the worst musical — he certainly made worse movies — but even then I’m not sure he was right. Silk Stockings had a bigger budget, and a Cole Porter score, but it isn’t much fun. Nor are Three Little Words or Blue Skies, despite the great “Puttin’ on the Ritz” routine in the latter, with its nine reflected Astaires. Not, mind you, that Second Chorus is a patch on his best features. It’s perhaps the most dramatically thin of all his musicals, with a central conflict (Fred and Burgess Meredith as superannuated musical college roommates constantly one-upping each other) that becomes steadily more obnoxious. As one of the picture’s producers Astaire merits as much of the blame for it as anybody, but it’s hard for me to really dislike anything with Fred Astaire in it, or Paulette Goddard, for all that she’s no singer and assuredly no dancer. Playing himself, Artie Shaw comes off as a stiff and Meredith is almost shockingly unlikable, but admirers of the Preston Sturges stock company will enjoy seeing Jimmy Conlin as a collection agent. Best of all is Charles Butterworth as a millionaire big band fiend and amateur mandolinist. It was Butterworth who in Every Day’s a Holiday delivered the immortal line, “‘You ought to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini.” He was later immortalized by Daws Butler, who used Butterworth’s distinctive speaking voice as the inspiration for innumerable characters on the Jay Ward Rocky and Bullwinkle shows and for Cap’n Crunch in those ubiquitous 1960s Ward-produced Quaker Oats commercials. The minute you hear his voice you’ll recognize it.\n\nH. C. Potter directed with no particular flavor or distinction at all, from a screenplay by Elaine Ryan and Ian McLellan Hunter, to which Johnny Mercer and Ben Hecht also contributed, the latter without credit. I sense Hecht’s fine Italian hand in the scenes between Meredith and Butterworth, and maybe in some of the nastier stunts Astaire and Meredith pull on each other, which have the feel of warmed-over Gunga Din. What Johnny Mercer added only the Show Biz gods remember, although he did write some nice lyrics, especially to “Poor Mr. Chisolm” and the jaunty “I Ain’t Hep to That Step (But I’ll Dig It).” Bernie Hanighen wrote the music to the former, which becomes a big band suite both danced and conducted by Astaire, and Fred’s longtime RKO musical director Hal Bourne composed the latter. (Astaire and Meredith play dueling trumpeters, and their playing was dubbed by Billy Butterfield and Bobby Hackett respectively.) But the creative poverty of the thing is indicated by the people involved not even bothering to come up with a name for the college at which Astaire and Meredith are perpetual students: At a dance, a cheap sign hanging over the bandstand reads, simply, “University.”\n\nShaw threw in some nice tunes, including a swinging “Concerto for Clarinet,” but he wasn’t any happier with Second Chorus than Astaire was. He did, however, have this to say about Fred: “I liked him because he was an entertainer and an artist. There’s a distinction between them. An artist is concerned only with what is acceptable to himself, where an entertainer strives to please the public. Astaire did both.”\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) It would be pretty to think this is the last we will ever hear of a franchise that has for years shown itself about as useful as a set of bald tires in a monsoon, but I think we all know it won’t be: Disney spent too much to buy the Lucas empire; it’s not about to slaughter a cash-cow that extensive. Those of us, however, who strongly suspected The House of Mouse would completely fuck up Star Wars have been vindicated. The studio did this partly out of arrogance (refusing to consult with Lucas or even to listen to the man who created these worlds) and partly from its own, admittedly profitable but creatively bankrupt tendency to indulge in endless remakes of what has gone before, a trait I imagine would have driven the founder of the company to a state of permanent conniption. The entire Disney Star Wars series has been a retread of themes and even entire plots that had been exhausted by George Lucas years ago. The final installment is not merely a coffin for a cinematic entity that had nowhere to go unless it jettisoned its own past, but, for anyone above the age of 12 armed with a scintilla of creative intelligence and independent thought, the three final nails in that casket.\n\nThe essential disaster at the core of this unnecessary movie is not merely that J.J. Abrams (and Chris Terrio, his co-scenarist) could not let go of the damned Skywalker family and their overworked parent/child dynamics, but that he was reduced to remaking Return of the Jedi. And who in his right mind would want to remake the weakest, more perfunctory movie in the original series? Even granting that the filmmakers were placed in a nearly impossible position by Carrie Fisher’s death following The Last Jedi, the very premise of this one is so ludicrous, so utterly and entirely risible, that it cannot stand up to the slightest scrutiny: That the Emperor, thrown to his explosive death at the climax of Jedi has miraculously not merely survived but become more powerful than before. Pull the other one, J.J. That it took no fewer than four writers to concoct this monumentally stupid narrative probably says more about the 40 year decline and fall of post-70s Hollywood than anything since the worldwide success of Titanic. Worse, Abrams & Co. were so consumed with trying to make this laughable situation work, and with pumping air into the dead-at-birth love/hate rivalry between Daisy Ridley’s Rey and Adam Driver’s annoying Kylo Ren, they neglected the one thing about the series that gave it a simulacrum of actual life: The human relationships around the action. We had every reason, after the second picture, to expect we would see more of Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico and John Boyega’s Finn, yet they are reduced here to glorified walk-ons, Finn not even being allowed to express his feelings for Rey at the end. Things are so shakily inconsistent that, when the young Luke is pictured training his sister, the face we see is not Fisher’s from the ’70s or early ’80s extracted from an earlier movie and digitally edited in (as Hamill’s image obviously is) but that of her daughter, who looks so little like her you don’t realize who she’s supposed to be until the fast little scene is over. Now, what the hell was that in aid of?\n\nThe plot, such as it is, and the abundance of Fisher outtakes from the two previous* movies permitted Abrams to keep Leia alive until the mid-point, while Mark Hamill appears as the Jedi shade of Luke and even Harrison Ford gets to show up as a ghost of some sort, or perhaps he’s an hallucination. By that juncture I’d stop caring about the distinction and was able to concentrate once again on speculating how a young man with a mug as militantly unattractive as Adam Driver’s can become a movie star despite lacking a scintilla of charm, humor or photogeneity. And for the first time in the series the unremitting ennui this movie spawned affected even the John Williams score. I’ve never heard this master of cinematic composition so dispirited, marking time with endless reprises of past Star Wars music and generating, if my ear did not deceive me, no new themes at all. If Williams can’t work up any enthusiasm, how can we be expected to? The single saving grace of the picture is the marvelous Daisy Ridley, and even she isn’t enough. Having out of curiosity imbibed in the first installment, I felt obligated out of a similar sense of inquisitiveness to see the wretched thing through to the end. Never again. My adolescence was not such a picnic that I’m eager to revisit it at regular intervals for the rest of my life.\n\n*Or do I mean, as I mistyped originally and which error — or Freudian slip — was caught by Eliot M. Camarena, “pervious”?\n\nThe Revengers (1972) A strange, fascinating Western starring William Holden that moves in unexpected directions, manages to be effective in both its horrific and its comic elements, and features beautiful widescreen work by the cinematographer Gabriel Torres and a remarkable performance by Susan Hayward as a sharp frontier nurse that lifts the movie into a realm few genre pictures achieve. Holden plays a former Union officer whose family is brutally massacred by a vicious band of Comancheros and who gathers from a Mexican prison a team of outlaws to pursue the killers. There are elements here of both The Searchers and The Dirty Dozen, although without, thankfully, the lip-smacking sadism of the latter, and the outlaws are entertaining without making you feel they’re about to commit fresh atrocities every 10 minutes. And each time you feel you have the measure of the movie and a surer sense of where it’s going the screenwriter, Wendell Mayes, surprises you. (Steven W. Carabatsos, the author of the screen story, deserves a nod here as well.) William Holden, a personal favorite since as a teenager I saw him in Network, gives one of his thoughtful late-career performances; his character is eaten up with bitterness but he doesn’t know how to focus his anger when the cause of it (Warren Vanders) escapes his grasp. Ernest Borgnine, as the braggart Hoop, is extremely funny and the wonderful Jorge Luke is unexpectedly touching as a young bandito who imagines Holden is his long-lost father. The picture is nicely directed by the veteran Daniel Mann, but Pino Clavi’s music, emulating the archaic/contemporary aspects of Ennio Morricone’s compositions for Sergio Leone, often feels misplaced and overly melodramatic, although it’s one of those curious scores that, while largely inapt in the picture for which it was composed, makes for rather pleasant listening divorced from it.\n\nThoroughly Modern Millie (1967) A charming, funny 1920s spoof nearly undone by the ’60s mania for big, overlong musical roadshow attractions.\n\nThe Mikado (1960) The enjoyable Bell Telephone Hour reduction of the comic operetta starring Groucho Marx as Ko-Ko. After being introduced to Gilbert and Sullivan during his vaudeville years, Groucho was an aficionado for life, and thrilled to be asked to play the Lord High Executioner on this live broadcast which also starred Robert Rounsville as Nanki-Poo, Barbara Meister as Yum-Yum, Stanley Holloway as the Pooh-Bah, Dennis King as the Mikado and Helen Traubel as Katisha. For a 54-minute truncation, the show, directed by the noted Savoyard comedian Martyn Green, is a fair reading of the original. Holloway is a robust delight as the last word in corrupt officials and Traubel a good match for Groucho, almost a musical Margaret Dumont. But the crowning attraction of anything starring Groucho Marx is, of course, Groucho Marx. He doesn’t attempt to Anglicize his performance in the slightest: His Ko-Ko is Rufus T. Firefly transposed to the stages of the D’Oly Carte; his patter songs could have been written, not by Gilbert but by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar. He even, at one point, performs the same herky-jerky dance moves beloved of Captain Spaulding in Animal Crackers, and when you consider that he was 70 at the time, those twisty high backward kicks are even more impressive. He’s so much himself that in “As someday it may happen” the line “And all third persons who on spoiling tête-à-têtes insist” is rendered as “And all thoid poisons who on sperling tête-à-têtes insist…” It’s a shame the only print that exists is a black-and-white kinescope, because photos of the production suggest the original color broadcast was a knockout. Still, it’s got Groucho, and that makes up for almost anything.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: Anyone under 40 who reads this should be given what I gather is the standard injunction now when dealing with the tender and easily bruised psyches of the young. So here it is:\n\nI’m finally old enough to have grown into my fogyhood, which has been choking me at least since I was in junior high school and, to paraphrase Thoreau’s splendid phrase, not keeping pace with my companions. So don’t think I’m going to spare your feelings now. I am going to make a number of sweeping generalizations about you and your generation with regard to the way you misuse and abuse language and grammar. The neologisms “Millennial” and “Gen-Z” will flow freely here, and without a scintilla of shame on my part. I neither dismiss you as human beings nor align myself against you with others of my age on general principal, solely because you are young and we no longer are. I merely deplore the half-assed way so goddamned many of you express yourselves. And if sarcasm offends you, you would be well advised to skip this little essay entirely.\n\nConsider that your official Trigger Warning.\n\nIn the latter half of the Broadway play and subsequent 1930 Marx Bros. movie Animal Crackers, Groucho as Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding famously dictates to Zeppo as his secretary Jamison a letter to his lawyers (Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga and McCormick) that is a sparkling put-on of all such business correspondence, wickedly parodying a form of inane legalese still in use today.\n\nGroucho: In re yours of the 5 inst: Yours to hand and beg to rep, brackets, that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe, i.e., to wit, e.g., in lieu, that despite all of our precautionary measures which have been involved, we seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment. Quotes, unquotes and quotes. Hoping this finds you I beg to remain—\n\nZeppo: Hoping this finds him where?\n\nGroucho: Well, let him worry about that. Don’t be so inquisitive. Sneak! I say, hoping this finds you, I beg to remain, cordially yours, regards… Now read me the letter.\n\nWhich Jamison duly does, leading to this immortal exchange:\n\nZeppo: “Quotes, un-quotes, and quotes.”\n\nGroucho: That’s three quotes?\n\nZeppo: Yes, sir.\n\nGroucho: Add another quote and make it a gallon. How much is it a gallon, Jamison?\n\nOne can only imagine with what delight, possibly alternating with nausea, George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, the writers of the book for Animals Crackers, might contemplate the near-complete wreckage of American popular speech in the 21st century. I don’t know who, or what, exactly is responsible for the decline, noticeable to me when I was a teenager but seemingly accelerating, of speech and simple phrases, concepts, cliché and even individual words. But I have my suspicions. (See below.) I actually heard a young man on a podcast yesterday, while reading aloud from a newspaper article and encountering an attributed quotation cited therein, say, “Quote, unquote” and then read the quote. The open and closed quotation marks were right in front of him, in their proper place at, respectively, the beginning and end of the phrase… as, I would argue, they have been all of his reading life. When did he start thinking they only occurred at the beginning of a sentence? And this was an otherwise bright, articulate, college-educated person, one who had studied ancient Greek, fer crissake.\n\nI realize the idiot reflexive mass-adoption of this ignorant phrase is not confined to any particular age group or demographic today. People of all ages, types and conditions now utter this cringe-inducing barbarism more often even than the dopes who say, “My thinking has gone 360 degrees on that issue” when they mean 180. But just as a trip of 360 degrees means arriving right back where you started, so too with “Quote, unquote.” If you say it before reciting the quotation, that quote is exactly and precisely nothing: The dead air between those two words becomes the quote. Is that really what you meant?\n\nWhen I was 9, our classroom was visited by a representative from Funk & Wagnalls — at that time a rather shockingly suggestive punchline from Dick Martin on “Laugh-In” — there essentially to sell sets of encyclopedias to the parents of us breathless and easily-influenced 3rd graders. (I duly tried. Mom, having already, in 1961, invested plenty in the boring old Encyclopedia Brittanica then gathering dust in a bookcase in our living room, used only occasionally, and grudgingly, by my older sister and I, took one look at the F & W brochure I brought home from school and told me to go pound sand up my… er, to go play outside.) Years later when I remembered this come-on from the realms of corporate America the naked commercialism aimed at vulnerable children appalled me. Yet I have never forgotten the publisher’s admonishing catch-phrase, emblazoned on the pin-back buttons this woman handed out to each of us that day: “We Never Guess/We Look it Up!“\n\nAs dopey as that sounds, I think of it every time the temptation arises to use a word or a concept, or to parrot a “fact” I have not examined. It nearly always stops me… and when it doesn’t, I inevitably regret it. The many sub-literates I am about to cite here, most of them anonymous, either misread a word or phrase, or heard someone else use it incorrectly, and couldn’t be bothered to look up the damn thing up in his Funk & Wagnalls.\n\nMisunderstanding of complex phrases is at least explicable. The seemingly universal misuse of simple, everyday words and heretofore well-known phrases is more difficult to comprehend, such as the way “incredulous” has replaced “incredible” in the Millennial lexicon (presumably rendering the old ABC television series as That’s Incredulous!) These things occur with such regularity now that Eliot M. Camarena and I, who alert each other to these atrocities committed against language, grammar and common sense when we come across them, have considered the advisability of compiling a Millennial Dictionary to catalogue the worst offenses. The spoonerisms alone are incredible — or do I mean “incredulous”? I joke, but only slightly, that the generations of the 1980s and ’90s (not to mention the Aughts) all went to Archie Bunker Memorial Grammar School… which I presume they would pronounce as “Gramma School”… and its adjunct, Archie Bunker High where, one imagines, in sex ed (do schools, after Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms and Jerry Falwell, even have sex ed?) they learned to identify on an anatomical chart the human “prostrate” and to become good citizens who would never, as a self-described internet journalist recently complained some of his listeners were doing with their comments, “sew discourse.”\n\nMillennials (and their immediate successors in the so-called Gen-Z) seem to have swallowed a dictionary by mistake sometime around the age of 10, and are in the process of throwing it up, in undigested pieces, for the rest of their lives. But call them on it and their witty riposte is likely to be either the sneering “Who cares? It’s just words,” the spurious cop-out “Language changes,” or the dismissive catch-all “Okay, Boomer.”\n\nI have exposed my own childish faux pas before in these pages, including my confusing the word “piccolo” with something my four year old brain identified as “pickle loaf,” a luncheon meat of especially repellent provenance. As a teenager, and owing to a routine on a Monty Python album, I once in my high school Honors English class mispronounced “hyperbole” as “hyper-bowl.” We all make such mistakes. It’s when we continue to make them, well into adulthood, and refuse to look up the words or phrases in question, that we risk the errors becoming a permanent part of the way we speak and write… and, because others see and hear them and likewise will not bother checking them for accuracy, of infecting the broader culture for years to come.\n\nHerewith some outstanding examples of the breed, read or heard within recent memory. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.\n\nLegendary. A once honorable word that now means either “famous,” “long-lived” or merely “worked in some profession or other for more than five years.” cf., Albert Poland, a man I had never heard of before last week but who is described in the blurb for his new theatre memoir as “Legendary Broadway and Off [not “Off-“] Broadway Producer and General Manager.” A legendary general manager?\n\nIt’s. Not a contraction of “it is.” Interchangeable now with the non-possessive form “its.” I wish someone who knows would explain this one to me. See also: “CD’s,” “Video’s,” “Movie’s,” “Record’s” and (yes, I’ve actually seen this) “Book’s.” Weirdly, and conversely, words and names that should, in their possessive form, receive an apostrophe-S, now often don’t; for example, “Chelsea’s” in the title of a recent video about the former Miss Clinton’s hand-picked wedding guest list including one Ghislaine Maxwell became “Chelseas,” which makes it sound as if there are more than one of her… a horror I haven’t the intestinal fortitude to contemplate. I suppose the old rules governing such things are now considered hopelessly oppressive, and possibly sexist, or even racist.\n\nThe word “hopelessly,” of course, inevitably leads me to:\n\nHopefully. The epidemic misuse of this defenseless word is one even the most dedicated grammarians gave up on well before the end of the last century. I sometimes wonder what the people who routinely employ that one incorrectly think when one of them sees Sweet Charity, which ends with the legend (legend!) “… and she lived hopefully ever after”? It must blow their parched little minds. Being an old movie, however (i.e., one made before March, 2021) I doubt any of them will ever see it.\n\nPundint. Used most often by politically-minded Millennials as a self-description. Since the origin of “pundit” is Hindi, maybe they’re the racists for adding a superfluous consonant to the word?\n\nLiterally. The complete misuse of this one to express exactly the opposite of its definition (“His head, like, literally exploded!”) was, like inserting the crutch-word “like” multiple times into every sentence, presumably as a place-holder while the speaker tries desperately to sort through the jumble of his or her disordered mind for the appropriate next word, despaired of decades ago. The crisis shows no signs of improving.\n\nLike. See above.\n\nYou know. See “Like.”\n\nSort-of. See “You know.”\n\nPro-offered. Otherwise known as “proffered.”\n\nAgree to agree. Once understood as “agree to disagree.”\n\nTaken back. As in “When I saw that, I was taken back a bit.” Nearly always spoken by a Millennial. Where do they think they’re going? Back a year or two? Decades? To infancy?\n\nEliot: “There’s a Groucho radio show in which he recounts his military experience, saying that when the commanding officer burst in and found him with the man’s wife, ‘I was taken aback. I was taken aback to the guardhouse.’ These twits would not recognize the joke.”\n\nThey wouldn’t even recognize Groucho. I once had a young man over to the house who, seeing a book of photographs of the (genuinely legendary) comedian on my coffee table asked, “Who’s Groucho?” and I thought, with an inner sigh, “What won’t a man put up with for the possibility of getting laid?”\n\nLegislators. Formerly “Legislatures.”\n\nA consorted effort. Presumably enacted by the Prince Regent?\n\nExpresso. Meaning “espresso.” I made that mistake when I was a teenager too, so I’m not saying I was ever perfect in my speech or deportment. I also, as a child, said (and didn’t everyone?) “pasghetti,” “Valentime’s” and “vanilla envelope.”\n\nBut I learned…\n\nEx cetera. Why “et cetera” even needs to be used at all outside an academic treatise we’ll leave to one side. This one, alas, is not confined to the young.\n\nBottle/Bag, out of. Heard on a recent podcast:\n\nPerson 1 (Millennial): I’m afraid the genie is out of the bottle.\n\nPerson 2 (Gen-Z): You’re right! The genie is out of the bag!\n\nAnd took the cat with it?\n\nBalled out. What you get when you… no, I’m not going there.\n\nBackstory. A trite cliché used by screenwriters and other Hollywood hacks and their reflexive fans to describe the life of a character before the movie or television series begins. I recently heard a Millennial podcast host ask his guest, an eminent medical researcher, to give the audience his “origin story.” I wish it had been me. I would have said, “Well, I’m a human being and not a comic book character, so I have a biography. Would you like to hear that?”\n\nOrigin story! Jesus Christ!\n\nVerz. For “vs” or “v.,” or “versus” in legal terminology. Verz?!? Is C.V. likewise pronounced “seeve”? Who makes up this shit?\n\nYou’re/your. The former is now written almost exclusively to mean the latter, and vice-versa. (Or is that “verza”?)\n\nTake it for granite. Do I really have to explain this one? Archie Bunker Memorial, folks.\n\nEggcorn. From whence mighty chickens grow?\n\nKerfluffle. The sound a marshmallow might make if it exploded. Try “kerfuffle,” you clots.\n\nFull board. The pet phrase of the somewhat estimable investigative journalist Jason Bermas when he means to say “full bore.” For Eliot, this was reminiscent of people saying, “bull faced liar,” which sounds to me like a visual pun in a Tex Avery cartoon. “When,” Eliot asks, “was phonics eliminated from grade school?” When, indeed?\n\nCow-down. Another bit of nonsense, also used by Bermas, when what he obviously means is “kowtow.”\n\nEliot: “I see some online dictionaries attempt to justify this idiocy by claiming it should be COWER DOWN, which makes even less sense.”\n\nBermas, slightly over 40 and generally articulate, also habitually elides his “t”s. “Important” is, always, “impor’ant.” Why? Isn’t it more strenuous to not dentalize the “t,” to work around it, than to just say it? Where did Millennials pick up this weird habit? In their classes on how to use Upspeak and most efficiently obtain the proper level of vocal fry? I once, while making an appointment with a rental agency, had to ask the Millennial office drone to repeat what turned out to be the name “Martin Street” about a half-dozen times before I finally caught on. She kept saying “Mar’in.” I should have requested she spell it for me. The only times these types don’t slur over the “t” is when it’s at the beginning of the word, or when it’s supposed to be silent. I feel like yelling at them a variation of what Truman Capote says to Peter Sellers’ Charlie Chan-like detective in the Neil Simon comedy Murder by Death when he screams, “Say your goddamned pronouns!”\n\nNoble Prize. Used by Whitney Webb, an even more estimable investigative journalist, when she means “Nobel.” How she could have reached the age she is now and never heard the name properly pronounced is as puzzling as her continually (which does not, my dear Millennials, mean the same as “continuously”) mispronouncing the name of the ghastly Ghislaine Maxwell, on whom she has done splendid research and reporting, as “Jizz-lane,” and her repeated references to “MAY-er” (not “MEY-er”) Lansky, whom one supposes was distantly related to Louis B. of M-G-M fame. As for “Noble Prize,” when I hear this I always picture Sir John Gielgud, head held haughtily aloft, being given a small statuette for dignity above the call of histrionics.\n\nSchizofrania. The word Ryan Cristián, the host of The Last American Vagabond website podcast, who originally went nameless here (I appreciate his investigations and insights even as his personal manner causes me distinct nervous tension) uses when he means “schizophrenia.” When he attempts the adjectival form, it sounds as if he’s saying “schizophranic,” or perhaps even “schizofrantic.” Cristián also consistently mispronounces the name of the Biden-Harris (as the President habitually refers to his Administration) Press Secretary: To him, Jen Psaki is, has been and always and ever will be Jen “Passki.” (Which once more brings Groucho Marx to mind, this time in The Coconuts: “You know… Passki down the streetski?”) But I suppose even that is at least marginally better than the YouTuber I heard refer to her as “Puh-sackey.” The website MedRxiv Cristián, having apparently having gone his entire life without encountering the universally recognized abbreviation “Rx” for medical prescription, refers to as “Med-R, xiv.” He also pronounces “exacerbated” as “exasturbated,” which sounds at least mildly dirty and — here the mind really boggles — mispronounces La Jolla, California in the snob-British form, as “Lah JOE-lah”… even though his own heritage is Puerto Rican. I also heard him, last week, struggle mightily to pronounce the drug name “thalidomide.” (“THALL-id-OH-myde” was the closest he was able to get.) It only caused the deaths or disfigurement of tens of thousands of children 60-odd years ago, but Cristián had clearly never heard of it before.\n\nIt’s a doggie-dog world. And some of them have been known to eat other doggies.\n\nTrailer. This now constitutes, in Eliot’s words, “Any video consisting of clips from a movie.” Even video advertisements for theatrical productions of plays announce themselves as “trailers.” No one has the slightest idea what the word means.\n\nTout his own horn. Eliot notes, “From the Times comments re Cuomo: ‘For him to take a victory lap and tout his own horn for a job well done’…”\n\nI’m suspect. The new “I’m suspicious.” I keep wanting to ask what the speaker is a suspect in. Theft? Murder? Vaccine-hesitancy? As Eliot once commented, “The centuries of evolution and culture that go into a MIND and look what we end up with.”\n\nHaving quoted Eliot thrice in a row, I leave the floor to him for a brace of his own examples of linguistic idiocy:\n\n“Speaking of a movie he really likes, one of the twits said, ‘I’ll always have a sore spot for that film.'”\n\n“Serena Williams said, last week, about her tennis abilities, ‘Nobody can light a candle to me.'” [Perhaps she meant “under”? Oh. come on, Ross. We all know she didn’t.]\n\n“Was about to note the complete absence of blandishments in their approach, when I remembered that from reading what millennials write they think that means insults! I recently read one who said, ‘He threw all kinds of nasty blandishments at me.’ It’s as weird as the many people of all ages who think ‘The Hoi Polloi’ refers to the wealthy class. I give up.”\n\n“I must be addicted to agony, what with listening to millennial chatter. One putz discussing film kept referring to Warner Bros as in Bernie Bros.”\n\n“Just heard a talk by a millennial. He used the ‘word’ OFTENLY. Maybe we could use a good, cleansing plague.”\n\n“Did I tell you about the pipsqueak who said, of a meal, ‘It made my appetite wet’?” [Is it wrong that that remark sort of excites my libido?]\n\n“BTW, heard a millennial (in a podcast, of course) discuss his success in some measly endeavor; he said, ‘I didn’t think I would accede to this degree.’ That’s up there with the other one who, changing the subject said, ‘Now let’s leeway into this next topic.’ I assume the ignorant twat meant segue.”\n\nAnd speaking of segues…\n\nNow, hold onto your lids, kids. The Old Fogy is about to pontificate.\n\nI am afraid that Eliot and I are writing for a dwindling readership; even the more intelligent Millennials are often linguistically appalling. And they know fuck-all about the shared popular culture. Forget the 1930s — most of these people can’t identify anything from before they drew breath, or first got plunked down in front of their unpaid baby-sitter, the television set. I heard one Millennial a few months ago refer to “that old movie where the woman is singing in the flowers on the hill” and realized after a moment he meant Julie Andrews in the opening scene of The Sound of Music… I was reminded by this of the college-age clerk in a Blockbuster Video outlet several years ago who was absolutely stumped by a customer’s request for a DVD rental copy of My Fair Lady. He’d never heard of it, didn’t know what sort of movie it was or where in the shop to find it. You work in a video store, I remember thinking, and you’ve never heard of any movie that wasn’t released before the year you saw Star Wars? And you couldn’t look it up? I had to find it for your customer? I felt like asking for a salary. (This is not to mention the young Barnes and Noble bookseller around the same time who, when I called to ask whether the store had a copy of Thurber’s Dogs, which I’d hoped to purchase as a gift for a friend and after I’d patiently spelled “Thurber” for him came back to the ‘phone after an interminable wait to say he couldn’t find it in the Pets section…)\n\nDwindling cultural memory aside, and returning to the gravamen of my complaint about reasoning and the decline of language skills, the question I suppose is why? Why have so many people lost the ability to reason, and to speak with efficiency? As a writer, I ever bear in mind the injunction of Professor Strunk, who opined in The Elements of Style that, “vigorous writing is concise,” and concision denotes intelligence. I am more and more convinced that chemicals, television and our appalling mis-education system are the chief culprits, and that much of this was planned; the extent of the mass dumbing-down is just too large to be entirely natural. A friend is equally certain the blame for the state of mass-mindlessness, which manifests itself currently in a widespread inability to understand the basic rudiments of viral science or to look past the inflated numbers routinely issued or proclaimed by government entities, is the internet. She believes, and I think she’s on to something, that over the last two decades the Web became the unofficial babysitter of children, the way TeeVee did for those of my generation and after. God knows the majority of the people who grew up never knowing a time when the ‘net didn’t exist are now hopelessly addicted to it, unable to refrain from staring down at a small-screen version, their thumbs racing in a constant and furious blur as they hack out instant messages to all and sundry as if their very lives depended on it. (I can only imagine what arthritic agonies they will endure after a couple of decades of this repetitive motion.) Not that this activity is in any way restricted to the young. The other day I nearly ran down a pedestrian who looked considerably older than me because she couldn’t lift her eyes from her Smartphone long enough to notice the traffic bearing down on her as she crossed an intersection against the lights.\n\nI recall with a wry smile my foolish notion, when the Internet first took root in the culture back in the mid-to-late-1990s, that since the user was required to write, rather than merely speak, greater literacy might be the result. (You may all now have a good horse-laugh at my expense.) Smooth composition and actual, as opposed to accidental, word-play, as Eliot suggested, is lost on people for whom Dumb & Dumber is — and I actually heard this opined by Jason Bermas a few weeks ago — “high art.” No wonder we’re at a point where millions of people believe the lies they are told by government. Government! Imagine! When I was a child the cry was not only “Never trust anyone over 30” but “All governments lie.” Maybe if these half-educated semi-literates saw a president forced to resign for subverting the Constitution they might stop trusting anyone in a goddamned suit and tie. As bad or worse: They think a word or phrase means whatever they decide it does because they heard or read it wrong and are too goddamned lazy to look it up. I wonder if they’ve ever even been taught how to use a dictionary.\n\nI hope that woman from Funk & Wagnalls is safely dead now. Not that I wish her ill, but otherwise the shock of what she would be seeing and hearing every day might give her a stroke.\n\nI’m telling you: Archie Bunker Memorial exists. They all went there.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nIn his appalling 1981 “Woe is me, I’m an Artist” moan-fest Stardust Memories, the annoying fans Woody Allen’s filmmaker character meets, and who include a pair of space aliens, inevitably comment that among his movies they prefer “the early, funny ones.” (One of the aliens also advises, “You want to do mankind a real service? Tell funnier jokes.”) As one who after following Allen for decades finally gave up on his sourness and self-regard over 20 years ago, I would like to disabuse his fans of the notion that his early movies were in fact especially funny.\n\nWhat they were, mostly, was simply original… not that being original in any creative field is all that simple, or common. Allen made comedies that reflected his time: Anxious, peripatetic, glancingly concerned with social and political themes but essentially attempts to fuse his nightclub and New Yorker persona and irreverent, smart-ass urban outlook with the plotless anarchic comedies of the 1930s, particularly the verbal tones of his idols, Groucho Marx and Bob Hope.* Perhaps because Allen had to be Groucho, Harpo and Chico (and Bobbo) all at once, these movies lack the gut-busting hilarity of items like Horsefeathers or even Animal Crackers. You couldn’t help admiring the craziness of them, their absurdity and flights of surrealism, even if you were only smiling rather than laughing outright, and sometimes not even doing that.\n\nAlthough he tended to come out better than his 1970s “rival” Mel Brooks in the critical sweepstakes, for me Allen always suffered by comparison, even when I was an admirer. Except for Sleeper in 1973 and Love and Death in 1975, his first few pictures tended to longueurs much more than Brooks’ did — arid dry spells that in Allen’s case went on for segment after segment until you finally hit upon one or two gems, verbal or visual, that redeemed the projects. Only when he began co-starring Diane Keaton in them did his movies go from indiscriminate collections of jokes and gags to something approaching the classic, non-Marx Bros. quality of great screen comedies. Keaton gave him something to play against, and to bounce his humor off; she was a helpmeet, a sparring partner, someone as gloriously daffy as he was irredeemably arch. Her Brando imitation in Sleeper is unimaginable in the movies that preceded it, for example, and the way she gives in to slapstick in the sequence where she and Allen are bonking each other over the head with bottles in Love and Death is worthy of a Lucille Ball or even a Carole Lombard. Personally, I tended to prefer the more “serious” Allen, of Annie Hall and Manhattan, which I like less now than I once did but which are still better written and more recognizably human than what came before. (I’m also still extremely fond of Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose and Crimes and Misdemeanors, all of which contain a humanism, and a sweetness, that the post-Mia Allen lost, seemingly for good.) And although he was never the deep thinker he believed he was, and more often pretentious than genuinely intellectual, at least Allen’s screen persona became less obnoxious with time, if scarcely less contemptuous of people.\n\nI’ve just re-watched Bananas and everything you always wanted to know about sex* (*but were afraid to ask) in the Twilight Time limited edition Blu-rays. They serve as a reminder that Woody Allen’s “early, funny ones” were, while occasionally inspired, a very mixed bag.\n\nBananas (1971) Allen’s first sustained effort as a writer/director is, while infinitely better and more controlled than the often-boring Take the Money and Run (1969) still a scattershot affair. The comic ideas pile up with enviable prolificacy but the picture is seldom as funny as it ought, or as you want it to be, and although it’s better looking than its predecessor and shows how much Allen had learned about effective direction and movie photography, it’s also still rather primitive. Even as a teenage Allen fan I found it a bit disappointing; granting that seeing Bananas for the first time in 1976 I was seeing “old” work, and further granting that, being an adolescent I was certifiably insane, my 15-year-old self’s reaction is pretty much the one I have when I watch the picture now. The good things are still very good. There just aren’t that many of them.\n\nThat Bananas is topically dated — it was dated in 1971 — doesn’t help. Allen and his co-writer, Mickey Rose, essentially place the Woody character (called Fielding Mellish here) in Baptista-run Cuba just before the revolution (they call the country “San Marcos”), mix him up with the rebels, install him as the new leader, and then send him back to New York in imitation of Castro. It’s a Bob Hope comedy updated with politics and a knowing take on American imperialism, featuring a neurotic/cowardly young urban Jew in place of the brash/cowardly Mid-Western Hope. Seeing Bananas now you really notice how much the Woody persona owes to the older comedian, and how ill it sits on him: The delivery is in imitation of Hope’s, but it isn’t organic to Allen and often the lines, not funny to begin with, just lie there, flailing uselessly, the way Fielding fumbles over his fund-raising speech in New York; the character’s embarrassment begins to feel indistinguishable from the performer’s.\n\nThe best things in the picture are the supporting cast, the Marvin Hamlisch score and Louise Lasser as Fielding’s inamorata. Although, like Mia Farrow’s later, Lasser’s persona is something of a dead end, her deadpan intelligence is obvious. When she and Allen ad lib together (they had been married but were divorced before they made Bananas) the rhythms they work up make the lines sound better than they are. Their funniest moment works against the scene they’re spoken in, since her character is breaking up with him and when she laughs at one of his improvisations and then tops it with an even better line of her own you think, “If they can have that much fun together, why is she leaving him?”\n\nWhile I normally dislike music for comedies that attempt to be amusing themselves, Hamlisch’s crazy scoring here really works; whenever I think of his music for the picture I find myself humming its riffs and they always make me smile. The opening credits song is especially apt and funny: A fiesta-like, up-tempo Latin ballad (Ralph Burns did the orchestrations) called “Quiero La Noche” that, sung by the Yomo Toro Trio, plays out over the brightly colored titles, the lyrics spaced between the cartoon sounds of gun shots and dropping bombs. It makes you anticipate a much funnier movie.†Hamlisch uses that basic tune throughout, in variations, and ends the movie with an absurdly earnest English language version (“‘Cause I Believe In Loving”) which, performed by Jake Holmes, is both pretty and effectively ludicrous. (Even the Spanish title is ridiculous.)\n\nWhatever one thinks of Woody Allen — and I now find his screen persona of the period, so amusing to me as a teenager, arrogant, largely un-funny and basically repulsive — his movies’ small roles are always wonderfully cast, usually with actors who bring a completely real quality to their lines, which of course because they’re not trying to be funny makes them even wonkier. In Bananas these actors include the soft-spoken Carlos Montalbán as the dictator of San Marcos (he sounds like his younger brother Ricardo but looks like his seedy uncle) who has his best moment when he realizes his mistake in bri"
