However, the limited in vitro catalytic activities described for these enzymes is at odds with their complex cellular roles, most notably in driving large-scale RNA remodeling steps during the assembly of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We describe cryo-EM structures of 60S ribosomal biogenesis intermediates that reveal how context-specific RNA unwinding by the DEAD-box ATPase Spb4 results in extensive, sequence-specific remodeling of rRNA secondary structure. Multiple cis and trans interactions stabilize Spb4 in a post-catalytic, high-energy intermediate that drives the organization of the three-way junction at the base of rRNA domain IV. This mechanism explains how limited strand separation by DEAD-box ATPases is leveraged to provide non-equilibrium directionality and ensure efficient and accurate RNP assembly.\n\nDEAD-box ATPases are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA processing, export, translation and decay as well as the assembly of multiple cellular RNPs1–3. Unlike other superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases, DEAD-box proteins are not processive4 and the structural and biochemical characterization of their biological function has been hampered by the complexity of their RNA and RNP substrates. In addition, most DEAD-box ATPases have very low in vitro enzymatic activities. Detailed biochemical studies of model DEAD-box proteins Ded1 and Mss116 revealed that they act by locally unwinding short RNA duplexes to separate up to ~16 nucleotides of duplex RNA5,6. Strand separation is achieved using a two-step mechanism7,8. First, in separate events, the N-terminal D1 RecA domain engages ATP and the C-terminal D2 RecA domain engages dsRNA ( ). Second, the two domains cooperatively assemble into a “closed state,” completing ATP and ssRNA binding pockets, stabilizing the D1/D2 interface and disrupting a limited number of base-pairs. This mechanism limits full strand displacement activity to short, topologically unencumbered substrates ( ). Product ssRNA engagement is maintained by conserved interactions with the RNA phosphate backbone and is dependent on the presence of ATP; substrate release is triggered by nucleotide hydrolysis9.\n\nThis strand separation and release mechanism is consistent with the canonical role of DEAD-box proteins as local disruptors of small duplex RNA elements. Established examples include RNA chaperones that disrupt metastable RNA secondary structures to promote proper RNA folding10, translation initiation modulators that resolve hairpin structures in the 5’ UTRs of mRNAs11, and disassemblers of snoRNA/rRNA duplex structures during rRNA maturation12. However, the majority of eukaryotic DEAD-box ATPases are involved in the assembly of large RNPs2,12,13. These complexes contain stable, topologically constrained RNA duplex elements that cannot be readily unwound ( ), raising the question of how DEAD-box proteins use limited local strand disruption to remodel thermodynamically stable substrates.\n\nTo study DEAD-box activity within a complex RNP, we chose the well-characterized biogenesis of the large ribosomal (60S) subunit. As part of this maturation pathway, the large subunit (25S) rRNA undergoes a series of defined structural transitions, coupled to the ordered incorporation of ribosomal proteins (RPs)14,15. This mechanism ensures the precise folding and docking of distinct rRNA domains (I-VI) around their root helices, whose association in early biogenesis has been proposed to drive subsequent 60S maturation steps ( )16. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ~70 ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) guide this process, including eight members of the DEAD-box family of ATPases: Dbp6, Dbp9, Has1, Dbp7, Mak5, Drs1, Dbp10 and Spb4, proposed to have dual functions as RNA remodeling factors and surveillance modules17–26. Although present in various proteomic and mapping studies of pre-60S intermediates26–31, no structural models are available for any of these enzymes and only Dbp7 has been associated with a specific rRNA remodeling event32,33. In this study, we focused on Spb4 because, although its molecular structure, precise rRNA substrate, and function in biogenesis were unclear, it had been assigned to a region of weak cryo-EM density within the State E late nucleolar 60S intermediate29–31,34,35. Our cryo-EM reconstructions show how local strand unwinding by Spb4 triggers an extensive, sequence-specific rRNA rearrangement. The stabilization of the resulting high-energy RNP structural intermediate drives the organization and docking of the three-way RNA junction that anchors rRNA domain IV. Our findings reconcile the limited in vitro capabilities of DEAD-box ATPases with the complex in vivo activities of these proteins.\n\nModels of nucleolar and nucleoplasmic pre-60S intermediates\n\nTo obtain cryo-EM reconstructions of sufficient quality to characterize the function of Spb4, we enriched Spb4-containing particles in vivo by overexpressing tagged Spb4 along with a tagged version of RBF Ytm1 that lacks its N-terminal ubiquitin like domain (Ytm1ΔUBL) (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). In these strains, the large dynein-like AAA+ ATPase Rea1 fails to remove Ytm1ΔUBL from pre-60S particles, halting biogenesis prior to the release of Spb4 and causing the accumulation of nucleolar State E36. Single particle cryo-EM reconstructions of a homogeneous sample obtained by Ytm1ΔUBL/Spb4 tandem affinity purification ( ) generated high-quality maps with overall resolutions of 3Å ( – , , , ). Local 3D classification defined two distinct states, which we call E1 and E2. ( , , ). State E2 is distinguished by the presence of the methyltransferase domain (MTD) of the RBF Spb1 and the newly localized RBF Rrp17( , , ). The temporal assignment of these structures is consistent with quantitative, time-resolved mass-spectrometry data and with cryo-EM reconstructions of 60S intermediates lacking Rrp17, which are blocked in the E1 state (K.S., V.E.C, C.S.W and J.P.E., unpublished data). Clear density corresponding to Spb4 is present in both E1 and E2 but is of slightly higher quality in state E2. Additional maps were obtained by locally refining five sub-regions centered, respectively, around Spb1, Spb4, the Noc2/Noc3 complex, the L1-stalk/uL1 assembly, and the “foot” structure surrounding internal transcribed sequence 2 (ITS-2) ( and ). This set of overlapping maps allowed us to interpret and build atomic models into previously unidentified or poorly resolved regions of the State E 60S intermediate. In addition to allowing a full characterization of the Spb4/60S interaction, we built atomic models of the Spb1-MTD/A-loop interaction as well as de novo structures for the RBFs Noc2 and Loc1 ( , ), the RP uL1 and additional structural elements of RBFs Noc3, Cic1, Nop2, Spb1, Ytm1 and Erb1, yielding the most complete and accurate molecular model of the late nucleolar pre-60S intermediate to date ( , , ). Spb4 is removed from the pre-60S during the factor exchange characteristic of the transition from nucleolar to nucleoplasmic pre-60S intermediates, a process triggered by the AAA+ ATPase Rea135,37,38. To better understand the immediate structural consequences of Spb4 removal, we also purified 60S intermediates enriched for the RBFs Nop53 and Spb1 (State NE1) via tandem affinity purification from steady state lysates ( , Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). A single particle reconstruction of this intermediate to 2.8 Å shows the pre-60S structure that most closely resembles the previously described NE1 state35, except for the presence of uL2 and eL43 and the lack of clear density for the Spb1-MTD ( , , , ). An analysis of this intermediate allowed for a direct structural comparison with the preceding E2 intermediate and revealed a previously uncharacterized helix within the RBF Nop53 that stabilizes expansion segment 27 (ES27) after Spb4 release ( ).\n\nTable 1 |\n\nState E1\n\nOverall\n\n(EMDB-24296)\n\n(PDB 7R7A)State E1\n\nSpb4 local\n\n(EMDB-24290)\n\n(PDB 7R72)State E2\n\nOverall\n\n(EMDB-24269)\n\n(PDB 7NAC)State E2\n\nSpb4 local\n\n(EMDB-24270)\n\n(PDB 7NAD)State E2\n\nSpb1 local\n\n(EMDB-24271)\n\n(PDB 7NAF) Data collection and processing Magnification81,000x81,000x81,000x81,000x81,000xVoltage (kV)300300300300300Electron exposure (e–/Å2)65.565.565.565.565.5Defocus range (μm)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)Pixel size (Å)1.081.081.081.081.08Symmetry imposedC1C1C1C1C1Initial particle images (no.)825,096825,096825,096825,096825,096Final particle images (no.)211,000211,000198,825198,825198,825Map resolution (Å)3.043.073.043.043.13 FSC threshold0.1430.1430.1430.1430.143Map resolution range (Å)2.4 – 102.4 – 102.4 – 102.4 – 102.4 – 10 Refinement Initial model used (PDB code)6ELZ6ELZ6ELZ6ELZ6ELZModel resolution (Å)3.113.102.993.103.47 FSC threshold0.50.50.50.50.5Map sharpening B factor (Å2)86.3580.391.6797.1682.77Model composition Non-hydrogen atoms153419399941586124172335228 Protein residues1168430691208432732537 Nucleotides27987162887715694B factors (Å2) Protein17.238.7711.9818.0427.73 Nucleotides24.6151.5621.9126.6744.42 Ligand28.8744.8410.6731.538.69R.m.s. deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.0040.0040.0030.0030.008 Bond angles (°)0.6030.5870.5520.4430.679 Validation MolProbity score1.71.591.681.541.64 Clashscore7.296.236.985.015.97 Poor rotamers (%)0.010.040.0300.05 Ramachandran plot Favored (%)95.6496.2995.7895.9495.44 Allowed (%)4.33.714.184.064.48 Disallowed (%)0.0600.0400.08\n\nTable 2 |\n\nState E2\n\nNoc2/Noc3 local\n\n(EMDB-24280)\n\n(PDB 7R6K)State E2\n\nFoot local\n\n(EMDB-24286)\n\n(PDB 7R6Q)State E2\n\nL1 stalk\n\n(EMDB-24297)\n\n(PDB 7R7C)State NE1\n\nOverall\n\n(EMDB-26259)\n\n(PDB 7U0H) Data collection and processing Magnification81,000x81,000x81,000x81,000xVoltage (kV)300300300300Electron exposure (e–/Å2)65.565.565.550Defocus range (μm)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)−0.9 – (−2.2)Pixel size (Å)1.081.081.081.02Symmetry imposedC1C1C1C1Initial particle images (no.)825,096825,096825,096776,404Final -particle images (no.)198,825198,825198,82582,670Map resolution (Å)3.172.983.712.80 FSC threshold0.1430.1430.1430.143Map resolution range (Å)2.4 – 102.4 – 102.4 – 102.4 – 10 Refinement Initial model used (PDB code)6ELZ6ELZ6ELZ3JCT/6YLXModel resolution (Å)3.563.104.302.96 FSC threshold0.50.50.50.5Map sharpening B factor (Å2)95.5778.23143.1474.53Model composition Non-hydrogen atoms210922882915741124275 Protein residues2183239913027798 Nucleotides1654392522897B factors (Å2) Protein61.7723.3880.911.37 Nucleotides93.7436.22133.6418.66 LigandN/AN/A113.6723.73R.m.s. deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.0030.0030.0030.005 Bond angles (°)0.5490.580.6730.683 Validation MolProbity score1.761.532.11.78 Clashscore7.536.3613.198.74 Poor rotamers (%)0.1000.09 Ramachandran plot Favored (%)94.9996.9692.5595.51 Allowed (%)5.012.967.294.46 Disallowed (%)00.090.160.03\n\nSpb4 triggers extensive, sequence-specific rRNA remodeling\n\nA complete atomic model of Spb4 bound to its substrate rRNA on the pre-60S was built into the locally refined maps. The catalytic D1 and D2 domains engage the phosphate backbone of rRNA residues C1941-A1945, which map to rRNA helix 63 (H63) in the mature 60S, in the canonical manner observed in other DEAD-box•RNA complexes ( , )2. The H62/H63/ES27 region is dynamic and not resolved in the structures of early nucleolar intermediates, but global SHAPE analysis39 shows that the H62/H63/ES27 region forms stable RNA duplexes in the earliest nucleolar pre-60S intermediates ( ) and footprinting experiments show that this base-pairing is disrupted when Spb4 is present29. Consistent with this data, H63 and approximately half of H62 are unwound in the E2 pre-60S particle ( ) when compared to their fully paired structures in the NE1 state after Spb4 release ( ). While H62 is topologically unencumbered and can be freely unwound, H63 is in a more constrained internal region of the 25S ( and ). This position disfavors the expansion of any strand separation activity by Spb4, since any resulting reduction in twist cannot easily be compensated by an equivalent change in writhe (i.e. a full rotation of the entire H63/ES27 region). Instead, we find that the local topological disruption caused by Spb4 RNA unwinding is propagated towards the rRNA core, leading to the formation of an alternate RNA helix (H62-alt) involving the bases of H62. The increase in twist upon formation of this compensatory helix maintains the overall RNA topology within H62/H63/ES27, and the formation of alternate base-pairs within H62-alt recovers some of the thermodynamic cost of Spb4-mediated strand separation ( ). Thus, H62-alt can only form because of the availability of a complementary sequence in close proximity to the RNA element initially unwound by Spb4 ( ), allowing this local dsRNA disruption to induce an extensive, sequence-specific rRNA arrangement. Remarkably, despite the presence of only 5 nucleotides in the active site of Spb4, this mechanism triggers the remodeling of 35 rRNA nucleotides from a single local strand disruption event ( , ). This mechanism is fundamentally different from the observed functions of DEAD-box ATPases in bacterial and kinetoplast mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, where DEAD-box ATPases are proposed to act as general RNA chaperones or ATP-dependent clamps, respectively40,41.\n\nCis/trans interactions stabilize the Spb4/60S intermediate\n\nThe E2 structure therefore represents a post-remodeling RNA “trapped” in a high-energy state stabilized by two cis elements within Spb4 ( , , ). First, the C-terminal extension (CTE, residues 406–499) packs closely onto the catalytic core of Spb4 and engages the four nucleotides (U1937-G1940) immediately 5´ to those within the D1/D2 RNA binding pocket ( ). These rRNA interactions are consistent with CRAC analysis of Spb4 rRNA binding in both yeast and human pre-60S ribosomes29,30. Unlike the ribose interactions at the D1/D2 interface, the Spb4-CTE interacts with the bases of the rRNA, ensuring sequence specificity in expanding the initial strand separation and promoting the unwinding of H62 to form H62-alt. The second cis element engaging the product rRNA is the C-terminal tail of Spb4 (CTT, residues 500–606), which forms a V-shaped α-helical structure that directly engages H62-alt and intercalates a conserved tryptophan residue (W536) at its apex ( ).\n\nThe CTE and CTT interactions suggested that both elements facilitate Spb4-mediated rRNA remodeling and are therefore essential in vivo. Indeed, expression of an Spb4 variant mutation at three conserved residues (R463A, R466A, and E469A; Spb4RRE-AAA), designed to disrupt sequence-specific interactions between the CTE and the rRNA ( ), is unable to complement the lethality of spb4Δ ( ). This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that the sequence-specific interactions between the CTE and nucleotides immediately adjacent to the site of initial strand separation promotes the expansion of the single-stranded “bubble”, disrupting h62 and promoting h62-alt formation. In vivo characterization of the CTT/rRNA interaction is complicated by the presence of a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) within this element30. To separate the localization and rRNA-interaction functions of the CTT, we generated three mutant forms of SPB4. Deletion of Spb4 residues 563 – 606 (spb4Δ563), does not affect growth, showing that the most distal elements of the CTT are not essential ( ). Expression of a spb4 variant truncated at position 511 (spb4Δ511), missing both the H62-alt interaction region and the NoLS, mislocalizes to the cytoplasm and is lethal ( , ). Proper cellular localization can be restored with the addition of a heterologous localization signal (spb4Δ511-NOLS)42( ). Expression of spb4Δ511-NOLS results in a pronounced temperature-dependent growth defect, ranging from near wild-type growth at 37°C to non-viability at 18°C ( ). This cold-sensitive phenotype is consistent with a role for the CTT in facilitating initial strand separation and secondary structure remodeling activities. At higher temperatures, RNA duplexes are less stable, making the CTT non-essential; at lower temperatures, RNA duplex structures are more thermodynamically stable, making the CTT contribution essential.\n\nIn addition to the Spb4 CTE and CTT, an extensive network of trans interactions between Spb4 and RPs, RBFs and rRNA segments helps stabilize the post-catalytic state. Prominent among these are direct interactions with Spb4; RP eL30, RBF Rrp17 and rRNA H58 interact with domain D1 while RP eL19 and Spb1 engage D2 and the CTE ( – left view). A long helical element within Spb1 (residues 347–389) bridges D1 and D2 to further stabilize the active D1/D2/rRNA interface ( ). Trans interactions also contribute to post-catalysis stabilization by binding the remodeled rRNA. The β-propeller of Ytm1 binds the first helical segment of ES27, while blade insertions in the β-propeller domains of both Erb1 and Ytm1 stabilize H63 at the junction of the unwound region ( – right view). These insertions are not ordered in the crystal structure of the isolated Erb1/Ytm1 heterodimer,43,44, suggesting that they become structured specifically upon engaging the high-energy Spb4 intermediate. Complementing its interactions with the Spb4-CTT, eL19 also interfaces with the H62-alt backbone using the same amino acid residues that mediate backbone interactions with H63 in the NE1 state and the mature ribosome.\n\nNucleotide hydrolysis precedes Spb4/60S stabilization\n\nOther DEAD-box ATPases have been visualized in a trapped, RNA-bound state, most notably the exon-junction-complex component eIF4AIII45–47. Unlike eIF4AIII, whose trapping mechanism within the EJC is nucleotide dependent, Spb4 is stabilized in the absence of bound ATP. The bipartite nucleotide-binding pocket of Spb4 is slightly open, placing key ATP-binding residues beyond hydrogen-bonding range and disfavoring ATP binding ( ). Mutations in DEAD-box catalytic motifs I (K57A), II (D172A), required for nucleotide binding, and VI (R360V), required for hydrolysis, fail to complement the lethality of spb4Δ ( ), indicating that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are required for Spb4 function. While the importance of ATP binding for strand separation by Spb4 is clear, the function of hydrolysis in establishing the post-catalysis complex is less intuitive. Overexpression of catalytically inactive Spb4 variants does not result in a dominant-negative phenotype, unlike overexpression of Ytm1ΔUBL ( ). This result is expected for Spb4K57A and Spb4D172A, which are unable to effectively engage ATP and therefore cannot productively engage the substrate. However, Spb4R360V, predicted to bind but not hydrolyze ATP48,49, is also unable to effectively compete for stable 60S binding in our overexpression system, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis promotes the formation of a stable high-energy intermediate. Consistent with this, purification of a Spb4R360V/Ytm1ΔUBL particle results in pre-60S yields that are ~30x lower than wild-type. Modeling of a closed, ATP-bound conformation of Spb4 using the high-resolution structure of RNA and ATP-bound Dbp550 indicates that the interaction between D1 and eL30 is more favored in the open state following ATP hydrolysis. To test this idea, we mutated a triad of residues on Spb4 expected to disrupt the eL30 interface ( ). The triple mutant spb4Q196A/R198A/R219A (spb4QRR-AAA) shows a moderate growth defect at 30°C ( ), consistent with a role in stabilizing the final, post-hydrolysis conformation of Spb4. In the context of Rea1-mediated Spb4 release, early hydrolysis ensures the immediate release of substrate rRNA once the interaction network stabilizing the Spb4 high-energy state is disrupted.\n\nSpb4 activity promotes rRNA domain IV organization\n\nHaving established the rRNA remodeling function of Spb4 and defined the structural details of its trapped post-catalytic conformation, we set out to understand the functional role of this high-energy intermediate in 60S ribosome maturation. We therefore focused on the differences between the E1 and E2 states, as well as comparisons to the NE1 state. In states E1 and E2, the overall structure of the H62/H63/ES27 region is similar ( , ). However, H64 and much of H61 are disordered in state E1 before organizing into a helical stack in state E2. In addition to rRNA organization, the transition between E1 and E2 results in specific RBF binding events. The E1 state shows partial density for a structural element of Spb1 we term the anchoring domain (Spb1-AD, residues 254–329). In E2, the MTD of Spb1 (residues 1–222) binds the cleft between helices H92 and H64, helping stabilize the newly formed H64/61 junction ( , ). In addition, E2 contains a previously unresolved linker region between Spb1-AD and Spb1-MTD (residues 223–253) that engages the H64-H61 junction with two conserved arginines, simultaneously stabilizing the junction and promoting Spb1-MTD binding ( ). Finally, Rrp17 binds opposite to Spb1-MTD on H64 and forms an elongated helical structure that acts as a structural bracket between Spb1-MTD and Spb4-D1 ( , ). Spb1-MTD engagement leads to the 5´-O-ribose methylation of nucleotide G2922, and our improved maps allow for a complete atomic model of the Spb1-MTD/rRNA interaction to be built, showing that Spb1-MTD remains bound post-catalytically, as the methyl group on G2922 and the presence of SAH in the Spb1-MTD active site are clearly defined in our maps. These data support a model in which formation of the H61/H64 junction, an important first step in the formation of the H61/H62/H64 three-way junction, is facilitated by H62-alt and is stabilized by Spb1-MTD and Rrp17 binding.\n\nSpb4 dissociation locks down the H61/H62/H64 junction\n\nBecause initial rRNA engagement and unwinding by Spb4 is too transient and dynamic for structural analysis, we instead focused on the disassembly mechanism of the Spb4 high-energy intermediate for further insights. Recent studies have shown that, after Rea1-catalyzed removal of the Ytm1/Erb1 complex and its associated factors, including Spb4, a transitional state characterized by the presence of both Spb1 and Nop53 can be isolated35. We obtained an improved reconstruction of this state by isolating particles from a strain with dual tags on Spb1 and Nop53 ( , , ). This reconstruction, with a resolution of 2.8Å, allowed for a complete molecular model of the H62/H63/ES27 region to be built, representing the structure of the pre-60S after Spb4-release and H62-alt disassembly ( – , ). We observe that, in addition to binding the RBF Nop7 in a manner analogous to Erb1, Nop53 possesses an internal helix that helps stabilize ES27 in its near-mature conformation ( , ) prior to the recruitment of the RBF Arx1. While we do not see strong density for the Spb1-MTD, Spb1-AD is still present, as is the central helix of Spb1 ( ). The retention of these structures means that the spontaneous reformation of H62 and H63 occurs in a tightly constrained space upon the release of Spb4, consistent with our interpretation that the interaction network surrounding Spb4 stabilizes a high-energy rRNA structural intermediate that snaps back into its most stable conformation after Spb4 release. Importantly, although H62 and H63 reform, they do so in a manner that completes the three-way junction underpinning rRNA domain IV ( , and Supplementary Movie 1). The organization of domain IV now allows for the incorporation of the L1 stalk structure into the core of the 60S, providing a clear mechanism that imposes directionality to this step in 60S biogenesis35.\n\nAn expanded functional repertoire for DEAD-box ATPases\n\nOur structural and genetic studies reveal that the DEAD-box ATPase Spb4 triggers the sequence-specific remodeling of an internal, topologically restrained RNA structure by leveraging a small, localized strand unwinding event into a broad RNA restructuring within the maturing RNP ( ). The thermodynamic cost of strand opening within the constrained substrate is offset by the presence of a position- and sequence-specific RNA element flanking the primary dsRNA engagement site. The presence of this RNA element allows Spb4 to stabilize an alternate, thermodynamically less favored base-pairing arrangement to yield a high-energy pre-60S intermediate ( ). This mechanism explains both how the limited strand separation activity of DEAD-box ATPases can be harnessed for restructuring RNPs and how substrate specificity is achieved by structural elements flanking the catalytic core of these proteins. Indeed, a subset of DEAD-box ATPases involved in ribosome biogenesis contain CTEs that are structurally similar to Spb4, suggesting that CTEs in these enzymes also define their sequence specificities ( ). Consistent with this, residues responsible for direct base interactions in Spb4 are conserved in Spb4 homologues but are not conserved among these related DEAD-box ATPases ( ).\n\nIn yeast, 14 DEAD-box proteins are required for 40S and 60S ribosome biogenesis. We propose that a subset of these enzymes may also act as sequence-guided RNA remodeling factors in a manner similar to Spb4. The wider prevalence of such activities predicts the existence of complementary sequences near the initial strand separation sites of other DEAD-box ATPases. While the binding sites and substrate specificities of the other DEAD-box ATPases involved in ribosome maturation remain unknown, alternative base-pairing arrangements have been proposed, most notably between ITS-1 and the 5´ end of the 5.8S rRNA26. The mechanism exemplified by Spb4 provides a mechanistic framework to identify and characterize other cryptic rRNA complementary sequences in ribosome biogenesis and other RNP remodeling events modulated by DEAD-box ATPases.\n\nWhile all previous structures of RNA-bound DEAD-box proteins rely on nucleotide for stability, Spb4 remains bound to its product after ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, instead relying on trans interactions to maintain the high-energy RNA intermediate ( , ). Our structures do not reveal how ATP hydrolysis is triggered, nor are the advantages of trapping Spb4 in the apo state obvious. We hypothesize that early nucleotide hydrolysis and release ensures that Ytm1, Erb1 and Spb4 disengage the unwound portion of H63 simultaneously to rapidly trigger the unwinding of H62-alt and reformation of H63 and H62, optimizing the docking kinetics of the mature form of H62 onto the pre-60S core ( , , ).\n\nA role in the kinetic proofreading of ribosome biogenesis\n\nInternal quality control mechanisms have long been postulated for ribosome biogenesis and DEAD-box ATPases named as candidates26,51. We believe that Spb4-triggered RNA remodeling exemplifies a high-energy intermediate state as predicted by this model ( ). This intermediate is maintained until additional RPs and RBFs bind and stabilize the root helices of domain IV, “locking in” its final rRNA tertiary structure and ensuring directional progress ( ). In contrast, misassembled substrates cannot be rapidly and irreversibly remodeled, therefore becoming kinetically trapped and targeted for degradation ( )25. Spb4 is the last of a cluster of DEAD-box ATPases that engage the nucleolar pre-60S in rapid succession31. The passage of assembly intermediates through sequential surveillance checkpoints defined by individual rRNA remodeling events could act as a “molecular ratchet”25 to increase the overall accuracy of the 60S maturation process.\n\nMethods\n\nYeast Strains and Media\n\nAll yeast strains used in this study are listed in Extended Data Table 1, all plasmids used in this study are listed in Extended Data Table 2. Genomic knockout strains were generated as described previously52,53. For purifications, Spb4 was tagged at the N-terminus with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) followed by a 3xStrep-tag II, the NEDD8 sequence from Bracypodium distachyon (bdNEDD8), and a MYC tag. Ytm1ΔUBL was tagged at the N-terminus with a 3xProtein A tag followed by the 3C protease sequence and a 3xFLAG tag. Spb1 was engineered to contain a 2xStrep-tag II between amino acids 597 and 598. Nop53 was tagged at the C-terminus with a 3xFLAG tag followed by the 3C protease sequence and a 2xProtein A tag.\n\nMicroscopy\n\nStrains were grown overnight in YPD to saturation, then diluted 20-fold into SC-Trp with β-estradiol to a final concentration of 2 μM for 1.5 hours. Images were taken on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk and a 100x NA = 1.49 oil objective. Samples were illuminated with a 488 nm solid state laser light source and images collected on an ORCA-FLASH 4.0 sCMOS camera. A z-series of confocal images was acquired for two fields of view in a single biological replicate. Image processing was performed using ImageJ.\n\nOverexpression and Purification of pre-60S Particles\n\nStarter cultures were grown overnight in YPD to saturation. The following morning, 12L of YPD were inoculated from the starters to an OD600 of 0.1 and grown at 30°C to an OD600 of 0.8. For overexpression of tagged Ytm1ΔUBL and tagged Spb4, cells were induced for 1 hour by the addition of β-estradiol to a final concentration of 2 μM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4000x g. Cell pellets were washed in Ribo-buffer A (50 mM Bis-Tris KCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 0.1% (w/v) NP-40) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g, then harvested and flash frozen. Cryogenic lysis was done using a grinding ball mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 6). For purification of Ytm1ΔUBL∙Spb4 pre-ribosomes, 20 g of lysate was thawed and resuspended in Ribo-buffer A supplemented with E64, pepstatin and PMSF. Lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 100,000 g for 30 min and loaded onto IgG Sepharose resin (Cytiva). Samples were washed with Ribo-buffer A, followed by Ribo-buffer B (50 mM Bis-Tris KCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP and 0.01% (w/v) NP-40). Cleavage of protein-A was done on-column using 3C protease, eluates were applied to a Strep-Tactin column (Cytiva) and washed with Ribo-buffer B. Elution was done by on-column cleavage of Strep using bdNEDD8 protease. For purification of Nop53∙Spb1 pre-ribosomes, the sample was obtained from steady-state cells grown in YPD to an OD600 of 0.8. Cell harvesting, lysis and purification was performed as described above, except that the elution from the Strep-tactin column was performed by flowing 5 column volumes of Ribo-buffer B enriched with 10 μM desthiobiotin over the column. In both cases eluates were concentrated using Amicon ultra 0.5 ml spin columns with 100 kDa cutoff (Merck Millipore) for cryo-EM analysis.\n\nGrid Preparation and Data Collection\n\nCryo-EM grids were prepared by applying 3 μL of Ytm1ΔUBL∙Spb4 samples at a concentration of 4.5 A260ml−1 or Spb1∙Nop53 at 2.0 A260ml−1 to glow-discharged continuous carbon coated Quantifoil R2/2 300-mesh or Quantifoil R2/1 300-mesh grids respectively. Grids were blotted for 3.5 s with a blot force of 12 and wait time of 15 s under 100% humidity at 4°C followed by plunge freezing into liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot (FEI).\n\nMicrographs were acquired on a Titan Krios (FEI) operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector using a slit width of 30 eV on a GIF-Quantum energy filter. Automated data collection was performed using SerialEM54 with a defocus range of 0.9–2.2 μm. For Ytm1ΔUBL∙Spb4 grids, each micrograph was dose fractionated into 50 frames of 0.05 s each under a dose rate of 26.2 e−/pixel/s with a pixel size of 1.08 Å, a total exposure time of 2.5 s and a total dosage of about 65.5 e−/pixel. For Spb1∙Nop53 grids, each micrograph was dose fractionated into 40 frames of 0.05 s each under a dose rate of 26.2 e−/pixel/s with a pixel size of 1.02 Å, with a total exposure time of 2 s and a total dosage of about 52.4 e−/pixel.\n\nCryo-EM data processing\n\nMotion correction was performed using MotionCorr255, and CTF parameters were estimated using GCTF56. All subsequent image processing was performed using RELIO57N. Initially, about 300 particles from 3 micrographs were extracted and binned to generate initial 2D classes as templates for automated particle picking. Automatically picked particles were extracted and binned 4 times for 2D classification. 2D classes resembling pre-ribosomes and showing clear secondary structure features were selected for 3D classification. Reference maps for 3D classification were low pass filtered to 15 Å. 3D classes were inspected in Chimera, and selected 3D classes were combined and re-extracted at the original pixel size of 1.08 Å. 3D refinement was performed with an imposed symmetry of C1, followed by CTF refinement and another cycle of 3D refinement with postprocessing. For localized classification and refinement, a mask with a soft edge was created around the site of interest, the core was subtracted and followed by a round of local 3D classification58. Particles that showed strong occupancy for the desired region were selected for 3D refinement. For state E2, overlapping local masks centered on the Spb1-MTD (3.13 Å), Spb4 (3.04 Å), Noc2/Noc3 (3.17 Å), the “foot” (2.98 Å) and the L1 stalk (3.71 Å) were used to obtain locally refined maps. An overall (3.04 Å) and locally refined map with a mask around Spb4 (3.07 Å) was also obtained for the particle subset lacking Spb1-MTD (State E1). Local maps generated for the Spb1∙Nop53 particle (State NE1) were used to select a homogeneous subset of particles for final refinement, the local maps were not used for model building. The final resolution in each case was estimated by applying a soft mask over the maps and was calculated using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143. Local resolution maps were obtained using ResMap59.\n\nModel Building and Refinement\n\nPDB 6ELZ36 was used as a starting model for states E1 and E2. Spb4 was built de novo starting from a Phyre260 model that contained the core RecA domains, the CTE and CTT of Spb4 were built manually into the density. PDB 6YLX was used as a starting model for state NE135. Interpretation of density was facilitated and validated with XL-MS data31,61. All models were built in Coot62 and refined in PHENIX using phenix.real_space_refine (Table S3)63.
