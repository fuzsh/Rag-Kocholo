        "text": "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold was one of four right backs included in England’s final 26-man roster for this summer’s European Championship as Manager Gareth Southgate trimmed his roster hours before the tournament deadline.\n\nBut after one exhibition game, he was out again.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, a late inclusion in England’s team, withdrew on Thursday, a day after sustaining a thigh injury in a friendly match against Austria. England and Liverpool confirmed that the young defender was out.\n\n“A scan on Thursday confirmed the 22-year-old will be unable to play in the forthcoming tournament so he’s withdrawn from the England squad to return to his club for rehabilitation,” England said in a statement posted on Twitter."
