        "text": "The Institute for the Study of Child Development is focused on research that is designed to understand the processes leading to healthy children and education.\n\nResearch\n\nHealth of children and families involves their emotional, social, and psychological functioning, as well as their physical/medical well being. For a complete understanding of children’s health, research is necessary at all levels of functioning, from the molecular processes underlying behavior to the behavior of the whole child. In addition to understanding the different levels of functioning, it was deemed important to measure the environmental context in which the child is raised. Indeed, to understand development at any level of functioning, from the molecular to the whole child, understanding the role of environment is critical to understanding the developmental process itself. The understanding of the environmental context in which the child is raised involves for the Institute not only the measurement of the social environment, but also the physical environment, including environmental toxins. Ultimately, it is the underlying belief that the study of children’s development will lead to innovative intervention strategies that will benefit children in their everyday lives.\n\nIn order to accomplish the research goals of the Institute, studies necessarily must include multiple levels of analysis. These levels range from characterizing the environment, whether it be the physical environment of toxins or the social environment of caregivers, to studying the relation between brain and behavior using brain-imaging technology. Our current research work includes studies of behavioral teratology, as well as studies of the long-term effects of drugs and other toxic exposures during pregnancy. It includes identifying factors that affect the behavioral and physiological reaction to stress and the capacity to cope with stress, including measures of the autonomic nervous system, such as heart rate and heart variability, as well as the study of children’s adrenal cortical functioning. Research also includes the impact of deviant caregiving and traumatic events, such as maltreatment or sexual abuse, that occur in the child’s life, and how these experiences affect the development of the child’s emotions and cognitions and, therefore, mental health, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorders.\n\nIn addition, the Institute studies the emergence of consciousness - the development of the mental representation that the child comes to have about itself - and the ability to utilize that knowledge in forming social relationships. Moreover, through the study of the emergence of consciousness, something that occurs in the middle of the second year of life, studies concerning the emergence of such pro-social behaviors as empathy and cooperation are undertaken. Finally, studies at the Institute involve both normal and deviant cognitive, social, and emotional development; studies with autistic children; studies with children with known disabilities such as Down Syndrome and Autism. Studies also seek to understand the sequelae associated with premature birth and how prematurity, a biological condition of the child, interacts with environmental risk in affecting children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. The Institute’s work also has focused on emotional regulation and inhibitory control, two processes that have serious impact on the child’s social and emotional development, as well as on its peer relationships and school performance.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Institute provides training for graduate students in clinical and developmental psychology, as well as in other fields of developmental science, including anthropology and education. It also offers research opportunities for pediatric, psychiatry, and radiology residents and fellows. Graduate seminars are conducted for students pursuing a dissertation within the Institute, covering such topics as research design, philosophy of science, and the current areas of controversy in such fields as developmental psychopathology, mental health, and family interactions.\n\nWork and study opportunities for medical students considering a specialty in Pediatrics also are available at the Institute. The program is sponsored either through the medical school’s research office or the Department of Pediatrics. Students traditionally work for eight weeks on research projects in progress at the Institute and complete a formal abstract of their research, which subsequently is published or presented at a research conference. The students have the opportunity to observe and study children in a laboratory setting, and they are exposed to data collection and analytic techniques.\n\nIn addition to weekly research project meetings and teaching seminars, the Institute provides seminars and lectures to the wider psychological, psychiatric, and pediatric communities. A monthly colloquium series presents speakers on such topics as affect development in children of depressed parents, lead exposure, sexual abuse, childhood obesity, neurodevelopment in HIV-infected children, and MRI studies of brain and behavior. Colloquium presentations by the entire Institute faculty are an integral part of the Institute’s activities, and many colloquia and Grand Round presentations occur in the local community, in the nation, and to international audiences. In addition, the Institute faculty frequently is invited to speak at conferences, academic institutions, and parent advocacy groups. Finally, a monthly Brown Bag research seminar is held where faculty of the Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and Rutgers University, are invited to present updates on their research activity.\n\nThe Institute, together with the Department of Pediatrics, has cosponsored an annual conference on topics of current interest to allied healthcare professionals providing services to children and their families. Continuing education credits have been available for those attending. The conferences have been jointly funded by the medical school, the State of New Jersey Department of Human Services Office for Prevention of Developmental Disabilities, and the Department of Pediatrics. Past conference topics have included: Environment-Illness Interaction; Motor Behavior: Theory to Practice; Developmental Outcomes in the Cocaine-Exposed Infant; Emotional Development of Children with Disabilities; Families’ Risk and Competence; Stress and Soothing; and Origins of Violence.\n\nThe three legs of the activities of the Institute - research, clinics, and education and professional training - have resulted in significant activities and products that can be found in the following pages. This includes research grants obtained in the last twenty years, the students and colleagues trained in our educational/professional training activities, and the publications of the Institute and its faculty. It is amazing, in thinking back over these twenty years, the progress we have made. The credit for such progress must be shared not only with the faculty of the institute, but with the three Deans with whom we have had the pleasure to work: Drs. Richard Reynolds, Normal Edelman, and Harold Paz; as well as to the support and encouragement of the chairs of the Department of Pediatrics: Drs. Lawrence Taft, David Carver, Daniel Notterman and Patricia Whitley-Williams.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1981, Dr. Michael Lewis was Director of the Infant Laboratories at Educational Testing Service in Princeton, NJ. From 1975 until 1980 the Infant Laboratory, under a ten million dollar grant from the Department of Education, became the Institute for the Study of Exceptional Children. The focus of this Institute was on the study of children with handicapping conditions, including Down Syndrome, development delays, and low birth weight. This Institute included a collaborative study with St. Luke’s Hospital in New York City, where a laboratory for the study of pre-term development was created. This was a continuation of prematurity research with Drs. Stanley James and John Manning Driscoll Jr. at Baby’s Hospital at Columbia University. At this time, he was an Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at Baby’s Hospital at Columbia University and then at St. Luke’s Hospital. In the course of this research, Dr. Lewis became familiar with Dr. Lawrence A. Taft, Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers Medical School. Through contact at research meetings, Dr. Taft and Dr. Lewis became colleagues and together edited a volume entitled “Developmental Disabilities: Theory, Assessment, and Intervention,” published in 1982 by SP Medical and Scientific Books.\n\nAs the first Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics, Dr. Taft was actively developing a Pediatrics Department that mirrored his own interests and included a Division of Neonatology, in which high-risk births and prematurity were treated and studied; a Division of School Health; a Division of Neurology; and a Division of Developmental Disabilities; as well as the more traditional specialties and subspecialties in a growing Pediatrics Department.\n\nGiven Dr. Lewis’ interests in development, both normal and dysfunctional, Dr. Taft invited him to become an Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics in the Department of Pediatrics and subsequently invited him to give a series of seminars on normal and dysfunctional development, including the development of cognitive-attentional processes, and social and emotional competencies. These lectures led to further collaboration between Drs. Lewis and Taft, and subsequently led to an invitation for Dr. Lewis to join the faculty of the Department of Pediatrics, to be housed in the Medical Education Building in New Brunswick, NJ. The possibility of establishing a research institute for the study of normal and dysfunctional development, through the appointment of Dr. Lewis as Chief of the Division of Behavioral Development, was an offer that was readily accepted. In December of 1981, Dr. Lewis resigned from the Educational Testing Service and was appointed Professor of Pediatrics at the Medical School.\n\nThe charge to Dr. Lewis in this appointment was to develop a research institute, and this charge was recognized by the Board of Trustees in early 1983. The Institute for the Study of Child Development was born. The Institute’s charge included research, clinical, and education activities for the study of normal and dysfunctional development. For the last twenty years, this charge has been the focus of our activities. In order to carry out the mission of the Institute, we have expanded our operation from the main site in New Brunswick to Capital Health System at Mercer in Trenton, Drexel University in Philadelphia, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School in Newark, and Children’s Specialized Hospital in Mountainside. The collaboration started between Drs. Lewis and Taft has been continued through the collaboration with the subsequent Chairperson of the Department of Pediatrics.\n\nThe average age across the United States for the diagnosis of autism and other developmental disorders in the young is 4 years. Many children with disabilities are not identified until 4 years because this is when many of them enter formal educational settings. This has been due in large part to the lack of developmental screening tools available to assess the areas of functioning which are associated with children with ASD and other deficits. These include the ability to interact with others, in particular their difficulties in eye regard and social attentional skills as well as their difficulties in emotional and social interaction with others, including empathy and sharing as well as the self conscious emotions of embarrassment, shame, guilt and pride.\n\nA screening APP for the iPhone and iPad called EARLYThree was developed by Dr. Michael Lewis, a University Distinguished professor of pediatrics and psychiatry, and by Dr. Tara Anne Matthews, a developmental behavioral pediatrician specializing in autism and developmental disorders, in collaboration with WebTeam Corporation, an information technology company. EARLYThree is available on iTunes.\n\nThis screening device is designed for parents so that they can assess whether their child’s deficits in the social and emotional domains are suggestive of an Autism Spectrum Disorder or other deficits. It is based on both developmental research as well as pediatric practices. Based on careful research, a series of highly specific questions are asked of parents, some of which require the parents to assess their child’s behavior during the screening. It is designed to examine infants as young as 8 months of age, the time at which ASD and other deficits can be readily detected. It can be used to screen children up to and including 24 to 36 months and it focuses on the child’s social and emotional behaviors as well as communicative skills.\n\nAnother unique aspect of this screening device is a set of questions regarding self recognition in mirrors. Professor Lewis first published a book on this developmental milestone in 1979 and it has been used subsequently with children who are mentally challenged and more recently with children with ASD. The results of all of these studies indicate that by 24 months of age, all children developing typically can do this task, however children with ASD and other developmental disabilities including children with Down’s Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy, for the most part are not able to achieve this until 4 years and even then only 60% of them can do so. The use of this competence as part of the screening procedure is an example of the “laboratory to bedside technique” which has guided us in designing a better screening device.\n\nThe screening APP is quite simple to use. Parents are asked to enter their child’s birthdate, and based on their age they are presented with a series of questions about their child’s behavior that are age appropriate. The APP has a set of questions for ages 8 months (for children 8-11 months old), 12 months (for 12-14 months old), 15 months (for 15-17 months old), 18 months (for 18-23 months old) and 24-36 months (for children 24 months and older). These ages were selected because of key social milestones, including social, emotional and cognitive development for each of these ages. For example, children by 8 months should engage in active eye contact and by 12 months should be engaging in babbling; that is using both consonant and vocal sounds with a rhythm particular to their parents’ language. By 18 months children should engage in pretend play such as “talking on a toy phone” or pretending to drink from an empty cup. By 24 months children should have the personal pronouns of me or mine and be able to engage in pretend play with other children or with their parents. The APP also screens for behaviors that are typical of children on the Autism Spectrum, such as repetitive behaviors, echolalia, and problem behaviors. The screening device contains questions and pictorial representations of these questions for each age level.\n\nIn addition to the parent questions, pediatrician input is also available. As part of this screening device pediatricians can assess children’s development and compare their assessment to that of the parents. The pediatrician can use this screening device in conjunction with the parents’ input to quickly scan the child’s development. Because it is parent friendly and can be filled out in the waiting room, the time it takes to complete makes it ideal for the busy practice as well as for parents who have little information regarding the milestones of development. This screening device has been used by over 8,000 parents and is currently being translated into Hindi and Chinese."
