        "text": "Memory is a flood, writes Ocean Vuong.[1] It is something we cannot easily control as it is already controlled by different triggers. Except in cases when our memory blocks some, usually traumatic, experiences, everything else can surge at certain moments. Both good memories, which can provide inner comfort and warmth, and bad memories, from which we'd like to hide, seem to overwhelm us. There are also second-hand memories. What I mean is that these memories are not about our own experiences and life events but of other people. The people who share with us what they remember, their stories become intertwined with our own memories. Sometimes, they don't even have to tell us anything.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, eight creatives went to the 14th biggest city in Serbia. During the relatively short-term residency program, the clear skies opened above us in contrast to the coal-stained smoky lid that vacuum seals the urban and rural landscapes during the cold time of the year.\n\nI have experienced censorship in different ways. I had only a brief encounter with military and totalitarian censorship when I was working on a project about the Graffiti of the Revolution in Cairo—I was warned that certain artistic positions have disastrous consequences, so I had to be careful about what I said and how I said it.\n\nA few days ago, someone asked me why as a potter and artist, I focus mostly on fat and diverse bodies. It was an interesting question. It made me go back to that exact moment when my relationship with my own body shifted and changed.\n\nIn this issue of I run high on the new and I love the old (#11), we will see the embodiment of some of the worst actors on the Internet. And all of that in the form of good old-fashioned comics!\n\nNew Year–New Me, new life, resolutions, instant solutions to issues whose foundations might have been building in us for generations–January carries the burden of bringing it all immediately.\n\nWe forget with every new cycle that the beginning of the calendar year is out of alignment with Nature's rhythms and that for a few more weeks, it offers us a space for surrender instead of providing yet the right environment to plant new seeds.\n\nI know that Madame Psychosis was actually a living person in the 70s somewhere in San Francisco on the streets. The name comes from a book; I don’t know the title of the book, it was dug out by a friend and I was really happy to actually bring Madame Psychosis back to life in Vienna because I didn’t want to bury Madame Psychosis again in the darkness of Denmark.\n\nWe create spaces, places, universes, alone or with others; that is something I deeply believe to be true. Do we love it? It depends on how much we want to use our creative control and how much we are open to receiving. People are often afraid of beauty and freedom. Beauty because it is not going to last forever, and freedom because it comes with responsibility and it's often a one-way ticket.\n\nWolfgang Tillmans had always been interested in how to make a phenomenon longer visible. They could be astronomical, social, or political subjects, and as a photographer, he uses diverse strategies to recall them in our minds. It seems like his artistic mind is already aware of our previous experiences, and he always finds a sensitive approach to show reality to his viewers. He dedicates his work to people and bodies, to landscapes, architectures, objects, and celestial phenomena, since he has been exploring the question of visibility since the early 1990s.\n\nPeople with low incomes in Vienna receive assistance, just as they do elsewhere. However, Vienna also invests in new housing and the renovation of old buildings, so the Viennese have an advantage of both systems. One of the differences between Vienna and other cities is that social housing flats are incorporated here in all districts and most of them are mixed with privately owned flats in the buildings. This keeps the rent down and ensures a real mish-mash of people living together.\n\nPlaces we love exist only in us is the opening sentence in a poem by Ivan V. Lalic. This video series is a project where I ask different people to tell their stories about belonging. Every episode contains 3 art workers of younger generations having creative control over how they want to be filmed, where, and what they want to speak about.\n\nIn this episode, you will see Ale Zapata, Christos Kyritopoulos-Ninas, and Els Van Houtert trying to share their thoughts and build a mirror for collective self-reflection. Dejan Klement 2021.\n\nYes, Another Fucking Lockdown Edition. But as it is also the last edition of the year, let's balance the scales with a bit of gratitude because, first of all, the whole concept of Improper Dose was born out of lockdown, and I'm very grateful for that—the Dose, not the pandemic of course.\n\nThere is an ongoing, urgent humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border. Refugees, who are trying to get to Europe, are pushed back into the primal forest by Polish Border guards and then harassed back into the wilderness by the Belarusian military. They wander without water, food, or shelter, and the weather is getting harsher. Humanitarian activists from NGO Nomada are currently collecting smartphones so people can ping their location and ask for help.\n\nBesides the strange dreams, there really was no indication for Nathan to send himself bizarre one sentence messages and he did not have a roommate, so this couldn’t be a prank. Additionally, if he really was sleep-walking last night, wouldn’t he have sent himself messages about Carol Baskins feeding her husband to the tigers? It didn’t make sense.\n\nHow can sound explore themes such as gender inequality, sexuality, personal experiences, or collective traumas related to post-colonization? If we take a look at these three performances where the sound became a tool for staying with the trouble - we will probably get closer to the answers.\n\n“I believe in the principles of democracy and realize that it can only work with a good education. In this case, it is necessary to be awake and aware of the system’s complexity and to choose means of expression that also reflect the historical context of the territory in which I work. If I subsequently present it in another country, different perceptions occur in the viewer, and the work, by relocating, acquires a new dimension. Context, always important, is what should be available here.”\n\nShe was ecstatic when she was offered this job. Finally, a position that completely aligned with her values as a human rights protector. Her years of unpaid work had finally been compensated. At last, the emptiness, the gaping vacuum, that she would feel at the centre of her chest most nights before dozing off to sleep, would be filled. A rewarding job! What more could she want?\n\nAs Florentina Holzinger devised her own Divine Comedy, at Kunsthalle, Tscherner also creates an alternative story about the great Narcissus. Compared to Holzingers’s work, the performance is also based on a narrative story, mythological background: Mirror, mirror concept based on the fairy tale of Snow White, and on the Greek myth of Narcissus, both stories connected with mirrors and virtual images. Narcissus in this way conducts a concentrate of his own virtual image, as it refers back to his role in Greek mythology where he eventually falls in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, staring at it for the remainder of his life.\n\nPlaces we love exist only in us is the opening sentence in a poem by Ivan V. Lalic. This video series is a project where I ask different people to tell their stories about belonging. Every episode contains 3 art workers of younger generations having creative control over how they want to be filmed, where, and what they want to speak about. In this episode, you will see Miloš Vučićević, Kata Martincsák, and Eugénie Desmedt trying to share their thoughts and build a mirror for collective self-reflection.\n\nA period for contemplation and the opportunity to let go of what no longer serves. Like the way we pride ourselves, we no longer need to abide by Nature's rules. Is it really progress if we use all the technological innovation to increase productivity? If only we, as a society, could live more attuned to these natural rhythms. Instead of surrendering to the early sunset with the rest of the ecosystem, we choose to live inside a tampon commercial, celebrating self-exploitation on a daily basis.\n\n“The lives that we live in these marginalized areas can be very closely connected with other people who inhabit other areas. We may not share the same spaces, but we certainly live in the same utopias. Hospitable, the name itself was supposed to encourage the authors to think about what it actually means, and from the position of an artist who comes from abroad, in what way he would manage to find ourselves in it, does that utopia exist in which way and does that hospitality still shape some prejudices among locals, in the city or the villages on the slopes of Užice.”\n\nFinally, summer! Windows closed, curtains closed, hiding in the darkest corner of my room to preserve the last bits of sanity. Trying to cool down in this heat seems to be as efficient as explaining to people that being skinny is not always a choice. As being not skinny is not always a choice either. A conversation that comes up more regularly during the summer break – aka body-shamers paradise, or anytime during the doctor's appointment.\n\n“Sharon's anxiety is interesting because we feel it. We imagine knowing what she was afraid of - as if we know the ending when we watch a film, but we enjoy watching it and move on. This saves us from the terrible burden of freedom, which is an existential horror.”\n\n“In my opinion, empathy is an infinitely complex topic. if you deal with it, you immediately come up against hard pro and con positions. I was particularly interested in the question of how empathy affects socio-political courses and social interaction. This topic is also the basis of my new collection. In the implementation of the cooperation, however, I wanted to move away from the hard political space and travel to a warm place that is characterized by empathy at eye level.”\n\nContrary to what politicians and mainstream media might tell us, the arts are essential; particularly in times like these that are brimming with fear and division. […] Seeing an act of creative expression is seeing the essence of someone’s being and reminds us of our own. Support the things that remind us of our shared humanity and expansiveness. Support the arts!\n\nFinally, reopening!\n\nYes, at the beginning of this month, we too were allowed to open our doors again, just in time to have at least a soft opening of our collaborative group show Shame Shouldn't Be A Symptom.\n\nAnd while we embrace the joy of getting back to normal, we are also trying to keep in mind how privileged that \"normal\" is. At least, for some of us. Last month we said no shame, and indeed, there is no shame in being white or male or straight, cis-gender, or just an EU citizen living in a developed western European country. But an important note is there is also no pride in it.\n\n“My personal goal as an artist is to add another perspective to the discussion. There are plenty of scientific statements on schizophrenia and mental health which are important, but so are emotional and personal insights and experiences. This discussion has to take place in public for everyone to take part and art can be the stage for that.”\n\n“Being surrounded with so much wealth and irrational consumerism everyday, living in one of the richest countries in the world, but also just the state of the world as we know it, has made me realize how to so many people it doesn't matter what they consume - as long as they consume it. Especially when it comes to fashion, the climate where trend hopping is most apparent.”\n\n“In times like these it feels like there is a need for artists to address and draw attention to topics like climate care and migration. We would not say about ourselves that we create political art. This installation is the first work where we addressed a topic like climate care and it was not our very first intention. Also there are many more layers in this artwork than only this topic…”\n\n“It is only once we are able to give our Shadow what it needs (ie: acknowledgement, acceptance, compassion, love) and no longer feel shame around it, that that we can accept ourselves as whole beings and move closer to being free from unhealthy and harmful behaviors…”\n\n“Speaking in broad terms, most cultures do not embrace open discussions or portrayals of mental illness or taboo symptomology. At best, these conversations are seen as uncomfortable. At worst, they're ostracized or criminalized. Anything that carries a negative connotation is something we may be judged or shunned for.”\n\nFinally, no shame!\n\nBut first, TRIGGER WARNING!\n\nDespite having already touched on some sensitive topics in the past, this month’s edition goes a bit over our usual amount of “everything that’s wrong (and right and somewhere in between) with the world”.\n\nParticipating in Mental Health Awareness Month again, this issue speaks about (but not solely on) suicidal thoughts and suicide – an act that carries even heavier stigma than other symptoms.\n\nAs mental health is deeply interconnected with other social phenomena, one of our external contributors sheds more light on Femicide, the murder of women for the reason of being women.\n\n\"In my understanding, art can and should be an offer to deal with oneself and one's own relation to the most diverse topics, and in the best case, stimulates an inner or interpersonal dialogue. In this sense, I believe that one possible task of art is to approach socio-cultural norms and taboos in a new way, through new language, and to question or criticise them.\"\n\nFemicide, the “murder of women because they are women”, should be a highly debated concept due to the losses it involves. However, most of the Austrian public seems to be as unaware of the concept and its roots as the influencers we encountered before. “Most of the victims of manslaughter are still men!”, some may say in an attempt to debase the claim that femicides constitute a specific form of violence, and that this is a practice that only happens far away, in other countries, on other continents even. “It was only because he loved her so much!”, others might argue, or “I am sure that she provoked it!”, just falling short of “I am sure she deserved it!”\n\nHe picked me up while we were both riding the 1-train uptown. I had been forgotten by a girl who drank too many bottomless mimosas at a drag queen brunch somewhere in Hell’s Kitchen. Apparently, a friend of hers thought I would be a nice birthday gift but had not counted on the birthday girl blacking out on public transport and leaving me behind.\n\nFinally, daylight saving time! (Just kidding)\n\nYes, once again, we messed up our natural biorhythms to preserve the over 100-year-old attempt to make war cheaper; by losing an hour of sleep. Brilliant.\n\nSo, first, we excluded ourselves from the symbiotic wholeness of Earth’s ecosystem. Then, we created the monetary system; another tool for excluding each other from the new system. Then, we tried to make killing each other over that system cost less by saying it’s 7AM instead of 6AM.\n\nI mean…truly, human kind deserves its place at the top of the food chain.\n\n“I think that no matter how you look at it, all the topics in art are always under the big umbrella of \"Human Rights\", in other words, art is always about human rights, about free choices, about the relationship between law and duty.“\n\nI couldn’t help myself as I was placing her in her new vessel, I lightly brushed my fingers against her roots. Then I made the next move and intertwined my fingers a bit with her. I smiled as I already felt our bond growing. For a second I thought that I could feel her move a bit, was it a sigh of relief on her end? Were her roots tightening around my fingers? My reasoning told me that this wasn’t possible, and yet…\n\nFotolog was a very popular social media platform in Spain and Latin-America which disappeared from the Internet some years ago. Or did it somehow survive?\n\nIn this issue of “I run high on the New and I love the Old” we will meet librarian robots, mid-2000s emos and a business model that might have saved us from losing our self-determination.\n\n“Our focus is on bringing together people who work in different disciplines and have a different perspective on Vienna’s art sector and its inclusivity. In most cases that means that we pair an artist who only recently arrived in Vienna as a migrant or refugee with an artist who has already been living in Vienna for a long time.”\n\n“Our Vision is to create an archive of the art scene in Vienna, a verbal photo album. We believe that artists can learn so much from each other and it is important to give them a platform to share.”\n\nWhether you call it winter blues or seasonal affective disorder, the end of February brings a promise that it’s finally over. Unless you have the opposite pattern of SAD and spring brings you into a downward spiral after months of calm. In that case, just know that you’re going to pull through and the world turns grey again soon. But if your well-being is more “being” than “well” no matter what the weather looks like, know that you’re doing great too! And when your brain gets confused about creating serotonin again, let alone how to keep it running long enough for you to notice, reach out!\n\nMy personal interest about the cultural scene in Russia and how it is influenced by politics, was growing for some time, especially after the last summer events in Belarus. And although Belarus and Russia are countries neighboring my home land Lithuania, I realise I know almost nothing about art and culture there.\n\nOscar Cueto was born in Mexico City, lives and works in Austria. His work elaborates exercises of writing narratives and reflects on the mechanisms that construct the notion of historicity, knowledge, memory and identity. Such themes are often developed as fictions and in recent work as installations in which the public can interact. His work is part of important collections such as Jumex in Mexico City, Vienna Museum, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and Museum of Latin American Art in Los Angeles. Since 2017 Cueto has been inviting curators and artists to Austria to collaborate on his nomadic project MUME/ Museo Mexicano.\n\nFor all the music lovers who feel a bit lost in these times of cancelled events - there is still time to dream, even if it’s a duck’s dream! Maybe concerts are part of a (hopefully not too) far off future, but new music still makes its way through to us. Besides the excitement of an upcoming gig you’ve waited for so long for, the thrill of listening to an album for the very first time is pretty much as tingly and delightful. For this reason, Improper Dose took the challenge to make an interview in English with the German band International Music and asked them to share a bit about their everyday life over the past year and the upcoming album Ententraum (transl.: a duckling's dream).\n\n\"I run high on the New and I love the Old\" is a monthly comic exploring the Internet in its middle-ages, before the supremacy of Facebook but after Geocities. Pedro del Real (@triquidick) explores and reflects on different social media platforms, many having now disappeared, that played an important role in his teenage years.\n\nI, meanwhile, do not have to go on a date during times of multiple Covid variants because I have commenced a torrid love affair with Roger, the peperomia argyreia plant sitting in my office. We’ve known each other for only a few months as he was an impulse buy off one of those Instagram ads, but I really feel that we have a connection like I’ve never had with anyone, or anything else.\n\nSo much excitement for this new year as if the virus promised to disappear with the stroke of midnight. It’s the end of the first month and what we have instead is its new mutation, neverending lockdown, rich people cutting the line for a vaccination and Austria celebrating Holocaust Memorial Day by deporting fully integrated families with children who were born in the country and can’t even speak their parents’ mother tongue.\n\n“(...) and then when I talk to these people I discover that they don't know anything about the arabic people and they don't have friends or anything from different backgrounds. I think you will recognize yourself in the meeting and dialogue with foreign people.”\n\nAs it has been months since we last saw each other in real life, at the end of last year we started to explore and experiment with different kinds of approaches and possibilities of the VR world in order to bring you an alternative experience of our projects. After some research and honest evaluation of our technical skills, we got to THIS\n\nEMBRACE ME is a series of images that explore gender-non-conformity and queerness. It shows imaginative landscapes and hybrid representations of bodies through which stories of queer, non-binary, trans and other gender-non-conforming individuals are told. The exhibition functions as a portal to a world in which gender is not a set of rules in a power dynamic, but a free form of expression.\n\nA very special thank you to our patrons! Both for your financial and moral support. We hope you like rad art and sweet 80s beats\n\nNot a patron yet? Check out how you too could be doused in our love\n\nIn this edition we do not only want to show you our real obsessions, but also our obsessions‘ obsessions. What do those who we admire admire? What makes them burn? We want to explore the passion that sparks a fire.\n\n“I‘m obsessed with taking baths for as long as I can remember. I love the climate and sound of this micro environment. When on tour as a musician, I urge the receptionist for a room with a bathtub. I don‘t need yoga classes or meditation to find life balance. The bathtub is my „place to be“.”\n\n“We initially started by hosting parties and concerts. This on its own, might not be considered a form of activism. However, we feel that recreation, existence and self care is a form of activism, especially when you’re black, because those things are usually not granted to us. In our way we’re allowing spaces for BIPOC to be themselves, to exist, to let go, express and enjoy themselves; and that for us is a form of activism that may sometimes be overlooked.”\n\n“Educate yourself. On your history, on your culture, on all the ingredients that went into creating you and the structures you inhabit. Real power lies in knowing. Before we can really get to know each other we must make a commitment towards knowing ourselves.”\n\n“Anti-Racism is a stand we all should take. It is important to point out racism in societies. We should go further when looking for a solution. More importantly, each individual should take responsibility to reflect on their role within society. I believe that we all hold a hybrid identity, especially looking at art as a great example.”\n\n“Today we salute to all folks who have to heal from the wounds caused by homophobia and racism at the same time. We see you. You are beautiful. We pray for you to be protected while you are unfolding your true colours. This video is the first part of the KIDS OF THE DIASPORA Series « Don’t Ask A Black Man How He’s Been » .” KOTD\n\n“I wish that when you are running, as a white person, a successful label or gallery and you see yourself as someone who is not racist or open, I wish that this person is more sensitive to trying to make a more diverse platform and try to support.”\n\nImproper Walls just celebrated our 6th birthday. Therefore we asked our whole team: Ale, Elisabeth, Elizabeth, Kata and Barbora, Urtė and Justina (read our \"script\" in the previous post), to contribute to this edition. Our question is how Improper Walls (being placed in this environment) shaped and shapes who we are. The answers made us cry and our hearts melt. We love you!\n\n- by Flora Löffelmann\n\n“Of course I am who I’m supposed to be – who else would I be?” – Our initial reaction to the computer unveils that\n\nit has already worked: For a short moment we have no doubt that we are, in fact, who we are supposed to be. And that’s actually a pretty rare thing.\n\nI like to think they teach me how to take life less seriously. How comfortable they are with being always half naked and badly drawn, while talking about all sorts of subjects. And how they are not ashamed of being emotional or stupid.\n\n“We listen to you and find together the right hairstyle for your suffering. A behavioral pattern from your childhood\n\ncan be changed through the process of growing hair. A braid who dissolves during days can palliate depression.”\n\nThis week we reached out to some of our favourite Viennese collectives (and individuals) to ask them, how are they doing/coping/adapting to these strange times we are all still experiencing.\n\n- Barbara Moura, Painter\n\n“This series is entitled 'Ladies in Boredom'. Because of not being able to go to the studio I had to adapt and find other mediums to work with and found myself going back to crayons and oil sticks, and somehow really got into this combination. “\n\nInterview with Leni & Cher from KOTD by Ale Zapata\n\n“Leni introduced it to the world in 2016.

What better way to do that with some teenage nostalgia? I want to share a game with you, that held me captive for a memorable amount of time back in the days.\n\nThis time, we focus mainly on support as we feel the drain and loss of energy from isolation.\n\nHow did we come up with this week’s topics? We want to share what personally interests us. Our team members work in a wide range of fields.\n\n- interview with Sophie and Paul from Contemporary Matters\n\n“However, since Earth has undergone at least five mass extinctions, why should we act now? And if we do, we need to ask: how should we act?”\n\n- Interview with Vienna based fashion Designer Norah Joskowitz\n\n“How do I describe my work? Everything is just made-up. That's the crazy thing about being self-employed. Of course there are a few guidelines, but in itself I just think up what I do.”\n\n- Interview with Nicola von Leffern\n\n“There is a beautiful thing about being a director (…) It is the simple fact that I have images and films to look back at.

I live in St Albans in the UK with my husband, 9 year old daughter, cat and two chickens.”\n\n- interview with Studio Terrible\n\n”My motivation is and has always been beauty. Beautiful things just make me happy and being dressed beautifully makes me feel empowered.

We have a background in politics, philosophy, art history, music and design — with ENTKUNSTUNG we follow all these interests related to art.”\n\nI love poetry - both reading and writing.
