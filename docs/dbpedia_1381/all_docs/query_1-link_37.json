The day before the game I was sick, and the afternoon of the game I felt worse. I slept badly the next two nights.\n\n\"If you look at the pictures, I did not look good on the bench. I didnâ€™t have a fever, but I felt like I did.\"\n\nGasperini added that he self-isolated for three weeks at Atalanta's training ground after the trip to Valencia and while soccer leagues around the world were postponed due to the pandemic and respected social distancing with his family.\n\nThe first leg between the two sides at the San Siro in Milan, attended by more than 40,000 fans, is believed to have led to many infections in Italy and Spain, with Bergamo mayor Giorgio Gori later describing the match as a \"biological bomb\".\n\nItaly has the third highest coronavirus death toll in the world, with over 33,000 deaths, while over 27,000 lives have been lost in Spain due to the virus.\n\nFootball\n\nEmma Hayes' USA back to summit of women's football with Olympic gold\n\n7 hours ago"
