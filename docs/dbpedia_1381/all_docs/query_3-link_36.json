        "text": "It’s Tuesday evening and soon everyone will be arriving at the Marching Virginians Center for the third full day of band camp.\n\nWhile the rookies and returners are rolling in fresh off of months away, our 2024-2025 leadership have been hard at work since Friday in-person and long before behind-the-scenes. Let’s get some insight into the process and see what they’ve been up to!\n\n•••\n\nFriday\n\nFriday for the MV Leadership was our work day! This meant different things for everyone.\n\nFor SSAs, drum majors, the head manager and the presidents or representatives of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, this meant individual meetings with Polly and Chad. Officers took care of tasks specific to their positions. Field leadership largely attended to chores to help prepare the MVC for the year, and officers helped out where they could. These jobs included organizing equipment, reorganizing both rooms at the MVC and the office, cleaning the MVC and so many more essential tasks for a smooth-running band camp!\n\nIn the evening, we completed registration and then proceeded into a leadership session with Paige, Thomas and Emily – our executive officer and drum majors, respectively. Here, we set goals and spent time bonding in preparation for meeting all of our new and returning members later in the weekend.\n\nSaturday\n\nOn Saturday, our MV Leadership met in the morning to discuss important topics like our schedule for the year and the special events that go on at each game. Later on, we met with Marching Virginian alumni Ben Nelson for a leadership training centered around respect, inclusion and what it means to be a leader.\n\nIn the evening, field leadership met to dust off their marching and instructional skills. The excitement for hitting the ground running is building!\n\nSunday\n\nOn the final day of leadership retreat, our field leadership had the special opportunity to perform at a funeral for a dedicated fan of Virginia Tech football and the Marching Virginians. This event was a great way to remind us as band camp starts how much we mean to our fans and how strong the impact is that we have on our Hokie community.\n\nSunday also included more prep tasks for before band camp, like uniform organization and printing music. Our new winds registered in the early evening, and as they met their sections and had their first general meeting and fundamentals session, our returners came back to register as well.\n\nWe are so excited to get to know everyone in the band this year, and can’t wait to see what this awesome season has in store!\n\nEarlier, you mentioned student research. What have you been investigating?\n\nSince my freshman year, I've been involved with the Wildlife Habitat and Population analysis lab, fondly known as WHAPA. With them, I've been doing camera trapping data entry since my freshman year, going through a bunch of pictures from cameras in Belize and helping folks identify jaguars and stuff like that. I was also briefly involved with a number of other projects, some of them centering around salamanders, birds, and trees. And then this past year, I've been involved with the Dayer Human Dimensions Lab. So in the spring, I was working on a shorebird disturbance project, and that's who I'm working with this summer. I'll also be working with them again in the fall.\n\nHow would you say the MVs impacted your time at Virginia Tech?\n\nThe MVs have always been something that was super special to me. The MVs gave me my friends for at least my freshman fall before I really got my legs under myself and was able to start branching out a little bit more into the university, and then they've been a home space to come back to every fall. It's definitely been my greatest social foundation while I've been in college.\n\nHow would you say being in another organization outside of the MVs has benefited you?\n\nIt’s taught me a lot about prioritization. There have been a lot of things that I would have loved to have done, but I've had to be a practice instead, like my involvement with Scouts BSA and the Order of the Arrow has kind of taken a backseat for the past couple of years because I've needed to be at practice. It's instilled more confidence in me that those organizations still want to be there for me when I have the time to be a part of them. It can be really gratifying to have to split your time between things like that, because it teaches you that those folks who you aren't able to be there with all the time actually care about you enough to say that, you're taking time away and that it’s okay. So it's taught me a lot about that, and just in general, it's given me a lot of time management skills.\n\nWhat’s your degree program and how far along in it are you?\n\nI just switched to biomedical engineering, so technically this is my fourth year but I’m junior standing with taking a semester off for the Disney College Program. I’ll be able to do all four years of MVs, which is great, because I’ll get my mug!\n\nBefore you went to biomed, what were you doing? What inspired the shift?\n\nMechanical engineering. A lot of what I wanted to do with mechanical was working on animatronics for Disney. In the last couple of months, seeing a lot of my family members with their medical issues kind of inspired me – that’s what I want to do, help people. I do a lot of service stuff… and I just love to help people in every aspect of what I do. I think the biomedical engineering is something that my dad has really inspired because he has a pacemaker and a defibrillator in him – growing up knowing that was saving his life every day, any time he could possibly need it, was really inspiring. It was like, I could do that with my degree and help more people and take our technology to a new level of innovation.\n\nWhat extracurriculars outside of the MVs did you engage in?\n\nMy freshman year, I joined SWE, which is the Society of Women Engineers. It gets me tons of networking events, I get to meet a ton of people and I’ve made tons of friends. It’s such a wide group.\n\nI’m also part of Valiant Indoor Guard, which is more spring semester, so I get to spin all year-round, which is fantastic! I’ll be serving as our treasurer this year. It’s really nice to have that change of pace in color guard and step away from the marching style to go more towards the story-telling. It’s like a totally different thing with indoor color guard because you have all of your weapons, you can do really insane flag tricks that you can’t do in Lane Stadium. There’s also the dance component. It’s a lot more artistic.\n\nI’m also a part of Line Dance VT, which is our line dancing club. I’ll be serving as treasurer this year. It’s a nice group of people – just kind of getting people out, getting them on their feet. The last one is, I’m in Alpha Sigma Kappa, which is a social sorority for women in technical studies. It’s a lot more laid back from your actual sororities, but we do a lot of service events and philanthropy, and social events.\n\nHow would you say the MVs impacted your time at Tech?\n\nIt is the best decision I’ve ever made at VT. I could say changing my major was an amazing decision, joining every organization I’ve joined is an amazing decision, but the MVs is the best one. I’ve made some of my closest friends and met so many awesome people.\n\nHow would you say being in another organization outside of the MVs has benefited you?\n\nIt’s definitely been beneficial to me, because I’ve been able to meet people in similar majors who’ve had similar struggles. They know that experience and can help you through it. It’s really nice to have that support system academically. Being able to find those people and connect the dots is super nice. If I wasn’t in any of those organizations, who would I hang out with?\n\nWhat was your undergraduate degree? What’s your master’s in now?\n\nMechanical engineering and mechanical engineering. Double ME! I love being a mechanical engineer. It’s a tough major, it’s a lot of time commitment, but as long as you’re good at time management and communicate… people are very understanding.\n\nWhat extracurriculars outside of the MVs did you engage in?\n\nI was on the Baja Team at Virginia Tech, which is a competition design team that builds a new small high performance offroad vehicle every year and then we go and race against other colleges in different dynamic events… to see who has the best car. It’s a lot of fun! In addition to that, I was able to restart a club at Virginia Tech that’s been gone for about ten years. I was already a member of [the Society of Automotive Engineers] to do Baja, so I was like “well, I’ll look into it.” Little did I know, I would get so involved! We started with just three students and we were really able to take it and run with it. Virginia Tech has a lot of car teams… and what we were seeing was, teams weren’t actually talking to each other. What we did with SAE was, we kind of gave all those teams a place where they could come together and talk about their problems, share trailers, we’ve done all kind of stuff… meeting people in the industry, touring labs… It was so cool to grow it from three people to sixty – it was overwhelming.\n\nIf you do engage in any extracurriculars outside of the MVs, what are they?\n\nI am mostly involved in Hokie Ambassadors – those are the people who give those daily campus tours that you’ll see go around every day. Wthin that I am a mentor, so whenever the new training classes come around I usually mentor 2-3 different new guides. [I] help guide them throught the training process so they can give their own tours. Outside of that, I am also in Alpha Chi Sigma, which is a professional chemistry fraternity. Basically the whole point of this is to help develop my professionalism and to help get me ready for anything I want to do within the sciences, but it’s also a way for me to share my passion with other people who just so happen to like chemistry just as much as I do.\n\nHow would you say the MVs has impacted your time at Tech?\n\nThe biggest impact they’ve made on me I would say are the friendships, I’ve met all my best friends pretty much in the MVs. It’s created a sense of family… going to college, I was very much in my own little circle, but then I met the pix and whoever else is in band. It’s definitely deepened my sense of security when it comes to going to school. That’s something I’ll always be grateful for with the MVs.\n\nWould you say that being in another organization outside of the MVs has benefited you? If so, how?\n\nMost definitely Hokie Ambassadors – becoming a mentor, I would say, strengthened the leadership qualities that I [can] work on in the MVs. It really put things into perspective for me, how I could actually apply the things that happened with that organization into the MVs. As for Alpha Chi Sigma, I would say, for me the big part of it was just trying to advocate for my littles. You have to advocate for other people in the MVs too sometimes because we’re one big family, we’re one big support system. Every single organization I’ve been in has contributed in some sort of way with the MVs.\n\nHow do you manage your time?\n\nIf I can get dates well ahead of time, then it’s easier for me to at least try and schedule whether I have to meet with mentees, whether I just want to spend some time with friends… I would say just – literally my Google Calendar has become my best friend for that. It’s always important to set time aside just for yourself and it took awhile for me to truly grasp that. I figured it, now, but it took some time.\n\nWhat advice do you have for new students both within and outside the MVs?\n\nHonestly, don’t be afraid to branch out. With the MVs, it may feel very overwhelming, especially with how much time we spend at rehearsal, preparing for games… it can be a little overwhelming at first but if you have other passions that you want to pursue, then I highly suggest doing so, especially if you want to use your time in college wisely and want to enjoy it to the absolute fullest. I would recommend starting early – going to Gobblerfest, find what organizations you might want to join and just go from there, because you never know. There’s always going to be something for you, whether it’s the MVs or not.\n\n•••\n\nJaden is from Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nI’m an animal science major with an emphasis in poultry, and [I’m] minoring in food science and technology. I’ve just completed my third year, so I’m going into my last one.\n\nIf you engage in any extracurricular activities outside of the MVs, what are they?\n\nOutside of the MVs would be with VT Recreational Sports. I got into it my fall semester of freshman year, I took a class. I ended up being an instructor this past semester and I loved it. I taught two different formats and then, going to this next semester, I’m going to add on additional formats so I’ll be teaching three. That’ll be BodyPump, BodyCombat, and cardio-kickboxing.\n\nHow do people get involved with those?\n\nThe first week of classes is free week. Usually, it’s about $50 a semester, but the first week is free and finals week is free so that’s how I got into it freshman year. I fell in love with it just because it’s [such a] strong community, very encouraging community, and I guess emotional-building with each other. You get to know the instructors and your other participants, and it kind of keeps you accountable – something to look forward to. If you purchase the group exercise pass for the semester or the year, then you can just go to any class at any time. There’s probably 30 classes going on in one day, maybe more than that, with many different formats… we’ll have more next semester because War [Memorial Gym] is opening.\n\nHow would you say the MVs has impacted your time at Tech?\n\nI met all my best friends in the MVs. I’m sure everyone says that but it’s one hundred percent true. I wasn’t going to join MVs, actually, and then my roommate was doing it and I was like, ‘What am I going to do when she’s at practice all day?’ so I joined and I’m so glad I did… I had a huge 330 [person] family on my very first day on campus. I’ve always felt welcome and since then I’ve met people with the same interests as me but also different interests as me and it's kind of opened my view on what I can get involved with and what my opportunities are. That also applies to education – before, I didn’t know what food science was and now I’m very passionate about it. Everybody supports everybody… if you ever feel lost or overwhelmed or stressed, you always have that group to go back to, because we’re all in the same situation.\n\nHow manageable would you say that your work with Rec Sports is with the MVs?\n\nI actually struggle more in the spring semester because I don’t have that daily schedule. The MVs help me manage my time a lot better and it kind of makes me get ahead on my schoolwork – or at least think I’m getting ahead when in reality it’s on time. In the spring semester I’m like ‘oh, I have time’ when I should probably do it ahead of time. Rec Sports, being an instructor kind of does the same thing [as the MVs]... in the spring. It actually really helps me and it’s very manageable.\n\nDo you have any other time management tips for incoming students?\n\nFind study buddies. Sometimes I need those people to keep me accountable and just make me feel that I’m not in this alone. College is supposed to be hard.\n\nDo you have any advice for new students who get involved outside of the MVs?\n\nTalk to as many people as you can, because they’re all in different organizations that you’re not involved with and you don’t even know if they exist, probably. Going to Gobblerfest, that got me involved with a lot… visually seeing what is out there. There’s some organizations that I wish that I would have gotten involved with before that I didn’t know existed.\n\nDo you have any advice for making friends outside of the MVs, especially as you’re getting there in the fall and it’s your whole world?\n\nFor those who may not know you just yet, can you tell readers a little about yourself?\n\nMy name is Paige and I’m a rising junior majoring in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Chesapeake, Virginia! I am a member of the Net section and this upcoming season will be my third season with the MVs! This past season I served as the Marketing and Communications Officer (MCO) assisting in running this wonderful page known as Marching with the Virginians. I am SO excited to serve as the newest elected Executive Officer for 2024-2025 and the memories we will all make as a band!\n\nCan you talk about your experience with the MVs up to this point?\n\nI auditioned for the MVs as an incoming freshman who quite literally knew nobody and nothing about college life. Showing up to band camp the same day I moved into my college dorm, I was TERRIFIED. The audition process is so unique and personal to everyone auditioning and I truly am so happy I was able to find a home in the MVs. Going into my sophomore year, I knew I wanted to be a part of leadership, so I applied for the Officer Team and got the position of MCO! Being a part of the Officer Team, and just leadership in general, has changed the way I view the band in such a positive way, which led me to falling in love with and applying for the position of XO.\n\nHow have the MVs changed your life, and how will the XO position contribute to your experience with the band?\n\nWhen I got admitted to VT, I knew I wanted to be in the marching band from being a part of the band all throughout high school and serving in leadership positions. College is hard, everyone will tell you that, but having a group of people to go through it with, makes it worth it and this band has brought me that. My amazing rank (Sass Rank 11 all the way!) not only welcomed me in with open arms but has always supported me and made long game days and practices SO much better with our rank snacks and traditions! To the entire Net section (current and olds), starting with the famous Aaron George who believed in me from the beginning, my roommates who we will forever be known as the “sophomore trio”, meeting my actual twin flames, and racing to Pigeon Forge on a random weekend in March with all of my best friends, I wouldn’t be able to accept the XO position and share my love for the MVs without any of you. Continuing to advocate for the band in the position of XO will only open me up to meeting more and more people. If you know me, I will yap forever and I cannot wait to meet all of our new members this upcoming season and welcome them with the same open arms my Net home gave me.\n\nHow do you plan to utilize the position as XO to continue great success within the MVs?\n\nMy goal for the MVs is to make the new members feel at home! Getting the news congratulating you on making it is such an amazing feeling, and I want to make sure that happy and joyful feeling of being excited for band never goes away while spending time with the MVs. From being in a sorority at the same time as the MVs, I have learned so much about sisterhood and the relationships that come with such tight knit groups of people. As XO, I aspire to create a form of mentorship program where new members can be matched with upperclassmen to better integrate them into the MV experience! Coming to college and having classes start almost immediately is already enough to worry about, but being a part of a strong and positive environment shouldn’t be something else our new members should have to worry about. By doing this, my goal is to ease the transition for our new members while also giving them the opportunity to socialize with sections of the band that are not their own! We are a band family, no doubt about it, and we are welcoming a whole new group VERY soon, so why not start now?\n\nSophomore year, Executive Officer Lauren Chuderewicz gave me an opportunity to be a part of something greater than myself – the MV Officer Team. The officers are the backbone of the entire band and nothing can operate without this incredible group of people. Becoming an officer was the beginning of my metamorphosis, and I felt that it was my duty to serve the band for as long as I could. I started out as the Music Librarian, printing copies of sheet music for numerous sections within the MVs. This was a wonderful position, and I was so thankful that Lauren gave me this chance.\n\nThings only got better from there. I started to emerge from my “cocoon,” as I found a solid group of friends within the clarinet section. I also had the chance to interact with other sections and leadership through my position as an officer. College was still scary, and sophomore year proved to be more challenging than I thought. Things were adjusting “back to normal” after the pandemic had mostly subsided, including a return to in-person classes, an increased schedule for band, and many other things. It was a lot of stress for me, and things came to a critical point when I decided to switch my major over winter break. Yet again, the changes in my life changed me as a person. College is about exploration, and I realized that it was perfectly alright for me to acknowledge the current problems and choose a different path in life.\n\nThroughout all of this, the MVs helped me to navigate everything. Even if nothing else was going right in my life, I had the support of my friends in the MVs and I still had music to perform for 60,000 fans in the fall. I was developing solid relationships, learning how to communicate with people of all different backgrounds, and working with others to create a better experience for current and future MVs. Then, I was selected to be the band’s Service Officer, which was a new opportunity to do more within the MVs. It took some time to adjust to the position, but I think I got the hang of it the second time around.\n\nMy senior year proved to be the best part of my time in the MVs. I had entered my college cocoon as an anxious freshman afraid to talk to anyone, but I emerged from this cocoon as a more confident senior with a reputation within the MVs. As a senior and the band’s Service Officer, I felt it was my duty to help other MVs have the best possible experience. It has been such an honor to serve in this particular officer position. From coordinating band camp activities to setting a record for “Hokies for the Hungry” this past season, being the Service Officer has been the greatest achievement of my college career.\n\nI wanted to also take a moment to shout out my biggest supporter throughout the entirety of my college career and life–my mom! I have made so many friends in the MVs, but my mom is my absolute best friend. You may have seen her at the MVC with a “Hokie Mama” shirt on, mostly embarrassing me, as many moms do. Regardless, she has supported me through everything I have done in my life, especially music. My mom has constantly encouraged my clarinet playing in numerous ensembles, showed up to see me perform at as many football games as possible, and has even helped me count cans for “Hokies for the Hungry.” All of my friends love “Momma Sasso” and I have to say that I do too! Thank you, Mom, for being my biggest fan!\n\nSo, why am I telling you about all of this? Well, whether you’re an MV Alumni or a prospective MV for the next season, I hope my story reflects just how special this organization is to all of us. In the MVs, I have found friends, family, and love all through the concept of music. It’s not just about playing James Bond and Led Zeppelin in Yankee Stadium or trying not to cry when the crowd cheers during our Pregame show. It’s about coming to rehearsal and seeing your friends after a hard day of classes. It’s about finding people who make you a better version of yourself, and that is what I have found during my time as an MV.\n\nIf you were to ask an MV what it means to be a Marching Virginian, they would likely respond with the importance of working hard, compassion, friendship, and being a leader. Many of the MVs today absolutely love what they do, and there is a special phrase that our organization lives by today: Ut Prosim, meaning, That I May Serve, in Latin. This Latin phrase is the motto of Virginia Tech, and as representatives of our university, we strive to keep it in the hearts of each MV. One very special Marching Virginian, however, is the very definition of “That I May Serve,” and his name was Ryan “Stack” Clark. Ryan was a victim of the Virginia Tech shooting that took place on April 16, 2007. He was, and is, very special to our organization, and I had the honor of getting to meet and talk with his remarkable mom, Mrs. Letitie Clark. I was able to talk to her about what her son was like, why he decided to become an MV, and how we can remember him and keep him in our hearts. Many of the Marching Virginians today didn’t get the chance to get to know Stack and understand the impact he had on the band. I hope by writing this blog post today, Mrs. Clark and I can keep his memory and spirit alive.\n\nTell me about what your son; Where did he grow up? What was he like?\n\nMy son Ryan was born in Germany with his twin brother, because at the time we were a military family moving from place to place. Soon after we moved back to the United States, where my son grew up in Georgia. He’s a lot like his mom in how he loved perfection; he always strived to pay attention to the little details. He loved people, and he lived by the phrase, “I can help.” He always looked for ways to brighten someone else’s day, or make the world a better place. My son had the biggest heart, and the Marching Virginians and the Blacksburg community was his pride and joy.\n\nWhy did Ryan decide to become part of the Marching Virginians?\n\nWell, since our family is from Georgia, we knew that it might be tough on our family having a child go out of state for school. When Ryan was starting to tour colleges in his senior year of high school, he went on a tour of Virginia Tech. Right when he arrived, he turned to me and said, “Mom, this is it,” he knew Virginia Tech would be his home. Ryan had been involved with marching band during high school, and he wanted to continue band in college. He was just so excited to come up to Blacksburg early for band camp, and he told me how nervous he was that he wouldn’t make it. He wanted to be a Marching Virginian so bad, and he would find out at midnight during band camp. He stayed up so late, waiting on the results of whether he would be accepted or not. Ryan read his name on the list of baritones that were new to the MVs, and he was just overjoyed. He was now a Marching Virginian.\n\nCan you tell me about the day that he passed away?\n\nYes. Even though it was 17 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. Although I’m now retired, I was a teacher at a local school near our home in Georgia. That morning I was already at work, and there was a television in our lounge where the news broadcasters had gotten information about something happening at Virginia Tech. As I was in the lounge with a couple of my coworkers, a couple members of the administration came in and said, referring to me, “Take her home, take her home now.” Nobody had told me what was going on, but in my heart I knew that something was very wrong. Our family had a plan in place for if there was ever an emergency, but I didn’t hear from my son. I had people at the house with me, and it felt as if hours had passed. Then there was a knock at the door, and there was a gentleman alongside a couple police officers standing on my doorstep. This gentleman was the coroner, and he told me that they had received word from the emergency room in Blacksburg, VA, and he said to me, “Ma’am, your son is gone.” From that moment on everything changed. This was the worst day of my life.\n\nHow can we remember Ryan and keep him in our hearts?\n\nI think the way that you all have named your Hokie bird after him is beautifully touching, and I adore the way that others have told you all stories about him and taught the band about him. I hope we can remember not what happened to the 32 people that day, but who they were and their impact on this world.\n\nMrs. Clark told me that in the days following the shooting, she felt like she had gained 330 new family members; the Marching Virginians. She told me that they rallied around her, and their support and level of compassion was overwhelming in her time of grief. She has created a scholarship in memory of Ryan, called The Ryan “Stack” Clark Scholarship, where this organization hosts an annual 5K run that benefits the scholarship. I was absolutely honored to be able to interview such a warm, kind, and compassionate lady, and the Marching Virginians wish her all the best. We remember Ryan and the other 31 victims of that horrific day not by what happened to them, but the impact that they had on their loved ones and the people that they met. To each of the families who lost a loved one during the Virginia Tech shooting, the Virginia Tech community, and the Marching Virginians — We are Virginia Tech.\n\nSince then, I’ve surpassed that goal and have made it to my next goal, which was to become a member of MV leadership. Now, I am a piccolo rank captain.\n\nI hope my story can be a testimony to what new members of the band can do, regardless of experience, and share what the Spirit of Tech is all about. The Marching Virginians is an organization that cares about community and service. I have made friends that I have gone through some amazing and terrible times with, and I know I can lean on them for anything. I have had some of my greatest memories of college in this band, whether it be at rehearsal laughing on the turf field, standing in the freezing and pouring rain, or jumping during “Enter Sandman” on Worsham Field in Lane Stadium. The Marching Virginians is an experience like no other.\n\nIf I could give any advice, tips, and tricks to any new member to the band, experienced or new to the world of marching, I would say you never know until you try. The Marching Virginians care about attitude, integrity, grit, and persistence. It is a matter of trying your best, listening to feedback, staying positive, and contributing as a member of the organization and the band. It takes work, but marching and adjusting to a different band arrangement is not hard if you put your time and effort into it. I now look back as a leader in the band to understand the incredible progress I have made, and how thankful I am to have people like Dr. Polly, Chad, and my section leadership who believed in me from the beginning, even as a new marcher.\n\nThere is nothing on this campus more incredible to be a part of than the Marching Virginians. It’s family, it’s support, it’s memories, and it truly is the foundation and the Spirit of Tech.\n\nVirginia Tech’s annual Giving Day fired off at noon on February 21, and for the following 24 hours the many schools, departments, and groups ‘competed’ in raising funds. The inaugural Giving Day event occurred in 2018, where 4,300 donors raised an unbelievable 1.62 million dollars. Giving Day has continued every year, save for 2020, and each year the number of donors and total funding has skyrocketed even higher.\n\nSo, what happened on Giving Day 2024? A total of $13 million was raised, just over $3 million more than the previous year. This is the single greatest jump in funding between years. Similarly, there was a massive increase in donors: 18,900 from the 17,000 of the previous year.\n\nThese are certainly impressive numbers, but we all want to know is: How did the Marching Virginians do? The total fund numbers for the amount the MVs raised is unavailable. However, we can see the donor numbers!\n\nThis year, 521 friends of the MV family contributed on Giving Day. This is a remarkable number; 171 more than the previous year. Much of this was possible due to the efforts of our very own MVs who, over the 24 hours, reached out to friends, family, and alumni. On nearly all social media websites there were calls to support the MVs, by both current members and alumni.\n\nThrough the College of Architecture, Arts, and Design, the Marching Virginians sought to knock down several funding challenges. One, the aptly named ‘Spirit of Tech Challenge,’ asked the band to reach over 425 donors, which unlocked the Jim Sochinski Spirit of Tech Award. Jim Sochinski was the second director of the MVs (1976-1981) and arranged many beloved pieces for the band. The MVs were also the recipient of the Ambassador Donor Challenge, which was awarded to the group with the highest number of donors!\n\nFor Giving Day, the Marching Virginians set up several giveaways. For those donors first in line, 10 MV swag items were given away. This included MV beanies, gameday baseball caps, or a bag of merch! After the first hour, drawings commenced for more item giveaways, most notably some retired MV uniforms. By the conclusion of Giving Day, 16 swag items and 9 uniforms were given to our amazing donors! The director of the MVs, Dr. Polly Middleton, posted a short video on the MV Facebook page thanking everyone who was a part of Giving Day 2024.\n\nMVs4Lyfe is an expression the band uses to say that a person will always be an MV, even after their time in band. The display of gratitude seen on Giving Day shows that MVs4Lyfe is more than words we say, it is in the actions we take. Thank you to everyone who made Giving Day a success for the MVs.\n\nWhile we may be in our fifth week of the semester, it goes without saying that the absence of the Marching Virginians leaves the passing of time feeling a little slow. Without daily practices, the smiling faces of our fellow bandmates, and a 7 p.m. “deuces!” in our lives each evening, the spring semester definitely leaves some longing for the return of nights in Lane. For some students, though, the fun has just begun.\n\nNestled in the corner of Cassell Coliseum, basketball fans and guests alike can bear witness to the Hokies Pep Band. Boasting over 100 members, the band elevates each men’s basketball home game with its pride and true Hokie spirit. Keen listeners will notice songs both new and old, some borrowed from the Marching Virginians catalog and some learned specifically for the energy Cassell brings. It’s an experience that, if you can get into Cassell, you won’t want to miss.\n\n“Pep Band takes the musical energy of an on-field band and trades some of the rigidity in favor of allowing the ensemble to take on its own personality,” said Andrew Stewart, four-year Hokies Pep Band member and MV Tone. When I reached out to him, he made sure to emphasize how the pep band has some serious funk. “The Pep Band has a certain looseness and swagger to it that you don’t get during the marching season. Not to mention we add some awesome guitar, bass, and drum set players!”\n\nThe Hokies Pep Band takes the condensed setting of Cassell Coliseum and runs with it. Since there aren’t as many rowdy fans as Lane Stadium in Cassell, guests are able to interact with the sounds of the pep band on a much closer level.\n\n“In both the wind and the rhythm section, people get to have a great time by playing with the intent to make people nod their heads and stomp their feet,” says Austin Wright, Marching Virginian Sax and bass player. “Pep Band is a group of students who care not just about playing their instruments, but being a part of the wonderful atmosphere in Cassell.”\n\nEven with the hype of a packed crowd, the synergy of the pep band is truly off the charts. Listeners can thank seasoned director and Marching Virginian aficionado Chad Reep for that.\n\n“We still work hard in pep band, and we sound VERY good,” said Reep. “There are less horn moves, and more individualistic movement. So the students have a little more freedom in how they want to move. Musically, though, we are still very together and uniform.” Anyone in the immediate vicinity of all things Marching Virginians know that Chad expects nothing less from his esteemed students.\n\nIn talking to each of the Pep Band members and Reep, however, I could tell how appreciative each were that the Pep Band exists. The group was seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, a key point that was mentioned in both interviews with senior members.\n\n“I had the honor of joining [Pep] band in my freshman year in which we were in Cassell with maybe [one quarter] of the band in attendance for a game at a time,” Andrew said. “I’ve watched the band transform from a fairly empty stadium to performing on a national stage for the women’s NCAA tournament.”\n\nAustin echoed the same sentiment: “My freshman year, the pep band essentially did not exist due to Covid…[we] had to be a much smaller unit.”\n\nNow, however? It’s like night and day. The band is like a massive wall of sound cascading over the seats that ring Cassell Coliseum. Yet, to Reep, the motivation stays the same.\n\n“Both Marching Band and Pep Band provide an amazing collegiate atmosphere for our college athletics, and even though they may be a little different, they are still a part of the same family. We are here to provide entertainment to the college crowds and support our Hokies!”\n\nCatch the Hokie Pep Band on Monday, February 19th at their next home game as the men’s basketball team takes on in-state rival and 21st ranked Virginia at 7:00 p.m.\n\nWhat are your jobs during a rehearsal at the MVC?\n\nI try to keep everything from going absolutely haywire! A typical day for me includes setting out yard markers, water, unlocking things, sound system, and preparing for game day! On Fridays before game days, we do game day chats, where we make sure everything is in place for the next day. We also get to go on super secret missions during rehearsal for Dr. Polly, which is fun and often also involves food runs! What does a typical gameday look like for your section?\n\nWhat does a typical game day look like for your section?\n\nWe get there 15-30 minutes before everyone else and the first order of business is to get the MVC field set up, load the golf carts, and start getting equipment down to Lane Stadium. I’m the one in charge of the golf cart (boss perks!), running back and forth from Lane Stadium while a couple other managers hold down the fort at the MVC!\n\nOnce we’ve made it to Lane Stadium for game day, we split up into our specific halftime groups and get prepared for halftime! We have two groups for plumes, and one for podiums, which rotate each game. At the beginning of the season, everyone gets put into a group with a designated group leader. These group leaders help facilitate things, while I choose which group I want to be in for halftime after making sure the others are all situated.\n\nAfter halftime, we finish the game and pack up the golf carts to go back to the MVC! We put everything away, sometimes have a team meeting, and then go home!\n\nThe thing that makes half time work is a comprehensive google document we have for each game. All the details and times for everything are on there, and we go over it each Friday before a game. By mid-season, game days are second nature. If anyone has any questions, they can consult the document, ask their group leader, then ask me! We work as a team that all want to help each other succeed.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a manager?\n\nThe first answer is that I didn’t make the saxophone section. I became a manager because I wanted to be involved in the band in any way I could. I had already met some really cool people during band camp that I wanted to continue to form relationships with. I kept coming back because I enjoyed the work I was doing. The managers that came in with me, Andrew and Brandon, are truly pinnacles of my college experience. I have learned a lot of communicable skills, such as organization, working under pressure, managing a lot of materials, etc., that I knew would carry me far as a person. I would make the same choice a thousand times over.\n\nOne of the managers, Connor Stein, has absolutely loved being apart of the MV Manager section! Here are some of the questions I got to ask him about his time in the MVs.\n\nWhat are your jobs during a rehearsal at the MVC?\n\nBefore practice starts, we take care of setting up the field by putting out field markers, getting jugs of water filled and placed around the field, and setting up the sound for the directors to talk to the whole band for corrections and announcements! During practice, we are much more laid back since we do not have immediate duties, but we will help when needed. For example, we will run batteries up the tower if microphones die, we will help with small medical issues involving band-aids, headaches, etc., and head to various locations (like Lane Stadium, the uniform place, and the directors’ offices). We also help percussion when they transition from concert arcs to marching by getting their music stands off the field and back into the practice rooms. At the end of practice, we pick up everything we got out at the beginning of practice and close the gates to the practice field.\n\nWhat does a typical game day look like for your section?\n\nDuring game day, we will load various equipment onto the golf carts and drive them down to Lane Stadium, monitor bathrooms to ensure tailgaters do not go in, and stay at the practice field during rehearsal in case someone needs anything along with setting up the field like a usual practice. We also help with lunches by setting up the tables with food in an organized-ish fashion. When we do “March to Victory,” most of us will walk on the outside of the band and three-to-four of us will stay back to lock up the Marching Virginians Center (MVC). During games, we will be a cheer squad with goofy dances till halftime. We will help with distributing plumes and setting up the podium on the field. Nearing the end of the game, about three of us will head back to unlock the MVC for the band. Once the game ends, we will reload the golf carts and unload them at the MVC.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a manager?\n\nI joined to get closer to my roommates with a common interest, and I ended up getting closer to, not only my roommates, but other people who I never would have met outside of the marching band.\n\nThe last (but certainly not least) of the managers that I got to interview this week is Alex Haynes!\n\nWhat are your jobs during a rehearsal at the MVC?\n\nWe generally arrive 15 minutes earlier than the rest of the band each practice (typically 30 minutes earlier on game days) and leave about 15 minutes after the band leaves. All this time is used to unlock the MVC and the field, place field markers, water jugs, a second drum major podium if needed, and set up the mics for the drum majors and the directors. We usually assist drumline in carrying music stands off the field when the band sets up for drill.\n\nDuring practice is always a good opportunity for us to complete tasks given by the directors, such as counting out swag for inventory and helping with H4TH!\n\nWhat does a typical game day look like in your section?\n\nOn game days, we split into two teams: the Lane team and the MVC team. The Lane team loads golf carts full of equipment, color guard poms, drum stands, and apples to go to Lane Stadium. The MVC team guards the tower and the bathrooms from non-MV affiliates. Once lunch is over and the band puts on uniforms to prepare for the march to victory, we march in pairs alongside the band. In the stadium, we sit behind the guard and we cheer alongside them. At halftime, we split into different roles. One role is in charge of the drum major podium, one is in charge of distributing apples and extra water, and two are in charge of distributing plumes. At the end of the game, we take everything back to the MVC in the golf carts, put everything away, and, win or lose, we call it a good game day.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a manager?\n\nI decided to become a manager because, although I didn't get to perform on the field this season due to audition cuts, I still wanted to be part of the band and help out the MVs! The managers are just as much part of the band as any section and are just as important. I also use some of my free time to practice and keep my chops up to get ready for next season's auditions!\n\nThis week I was so excited to be able to interview and get to know the manager’s section a little bit better; they are the section that many forget to consider when they think of the band. We wouldn’t really be the MVs without our managers, though! They are the wind beneath our wings, and they work tirelessly to help each of the marchers become better each day.\n\nFor many MVs, the spring semester feels like a coin flip. No daily practices, no weekend games, and not seeing your friends every day is a new and unusual feeling for the members of the band. Yet the MVs are still brought together this semester by a core value: service. One of the most important aspects of the Marching Virginians is our commitment to service. In this blog post, we will detail an upcoming MV Service Project and advertise other projects around campus that MVs can do together!\n\nStarting off is the chief MV Service Project: Blood Drive! On Tuesday April 23, from 11-5, the MVs will be hosting a blood drive in the GLC Multipurpose Room. For this event, there are two ways in which the MVs can help: 1) Sign up to be a volunteer at this event or 2) Donate Blood! As a volunteer at this event, you would help with sign-ins, setting up the room, and any other tasks the mobile Red Cross unit might need. If you plan to donate whole blood (standard blood donation), you are eligible if you have not donated in the previous 8 weeks, in good health, at least 16 years old, and weigh at least 110 lbs. Volunteering in either role, or even both, would be unbelievably helpful. Just recently, the Red Cross reported a 20-year low point for the number of donors and is facing an emergency blood shortage.\n\nAnother service activity is The Big Event! The Big Event is an annual day of volunteering around the Blacksburg community as a way for the students of Virginia Tech to thank the town. Individuals come together as a team and are given an assignment in the nearby area. It is tradition within the band for sections, or ranks, to form their own teams. Registration for The Big Event is not open at this time, but you can start thinking about teams to make! More information can be found here: https://vtbigevent.org/ and here: https://engage.vt.edu/programs/bigevent.html.\n\nOutside of these great projects, there are many places to volunteer in the surrounding area. Virginia Tech maintains a list through their VT Engage website. ‘Habitat for Humanity,’ ‘Kids Can Write,’ and ‘Literacy Volunteers of the New River Valley’ are just a few of the non-VT programs described. This info can be found at: https://engage.vt.edu/about/opportunities-outside-vt-engage.html.\n\nThough we may not march and play in the spring, the Spirit of Tech is still a presence on campus. Doing our part to help others; to make another person’s day better. These are actions we can always take and are a key part of the band. From Hokies for the Hungry to The Big Event, the MVs value service year-round.\n\nBefore the busses got to the hotel, we made a pit stop at McLean High School in McLean, Virginia. Here the Marching Virginians had a super quick break for pizza, and then it was off to the field to do one more run of our halftime show.\n\nWe prepared an abbreviated version of one of our favorite shows, Metallica, for the bowl game. This was a show that we had already performed in Lane Stadium, so it was less stressful than having to learn a whole new one during finals season! We ran through a couple fun stand tunes, the music for the show, and then put the show on the field. After a couple announcements from Dr. Polly and Chad, we were back onto the buses to drive to our hotel in Washington, D.C.!\n\nOnce we reached the beautiful Washington Hilton hotel, the MVs ventured down to one of the conference rooms to pick up their super cool swag! After picking up our swag, we hopped into bed very early. We had quite a big day ahead of us!\n\nread Part 2 by Seth Boehringer for more of our Bowl Game recap!\n\nJanuary 11 correction: the captions previously attributed the photos to MV Online Content. The attributions have been changed to Robert White.\n\nOver the past month, I’ve done a lot of reflecting on my inaugural year in the Marching Virginians. It’s gone by all too quickly, but with the season has come new relationships, amazing experiences, and a family of more than 300 people who I’m so fortunate to share the field with. Much of my reflection has been through my own view, thinking about the memories that I’ve made with those in my saxophone section and how I’ve grown as a person because of them. Coming into Blacksburg with a grand total of two other freshmen band members from my high school, I was nervous that I wouldn’t find a place to call “home” within the band, but the section (and Rank 21!) truly transformed my experience with the MVs. Realistically, however, I am one of 330 strong. I am only able to absorb so much throughout game days and daily practices. Therefore, I had to ask myself a question: what was the season like for other Marching Virginians?\n\nAssorted members of the band were gracious enough to respond when I reached out to ask if they could detail some of their most memorable moments throughout their seasons. Admittedly, I expected answers that were more surface level than anything, along the lines of “the practices” or “jumping to Enter Sandman” (which, let’s be realistic, is still very cool). What I wasn’t prepared for, however, was the profound emotional impact their responses had on my own perspective of what the MVs represent.\n\nSenior clarinet and service officer Jillian Sasso sent me some of the most touching memories from her four years as a clarinet. A seasoned member of the band, Jillian had the opportunity to illustrate how her relationship with friend and clarinet rank captain Rachel Smith was so important to her: “I’ve always had someone else in the section french-braid my hair before games. Rachel Smith, one of the Net rank captains, is an excellent braider and a great friend of mine, so she always does my hair…this has been a really special bonding experience for us because we get to talk about things and appreciate each other very much.” Jillian also spoke on how her pre-practice frisbee group was a great way to stay active after a long day of classes. While it may seem small to someone outside of the band, she mentioned that it was a great way to bond with her section and that it’s one of the things that she’ll miss when she graduates.\n\nI was beyond excited when senior VTuba member Seth “Willy” Boehringer reached out to detail his memories on the classic tuba rendition of the Hokie Pokie. A staple after the first quarter, the Hokie Pokie is arguably one of the most important experiences any tuba has the chance to participate in. The VTubas lead the 66,000 raging Lane Stadium fans in the dance and song, supported by the rest of the Marching Virginians (VERY carefully) dancing on the bleachers in front of them. It’s one of the most fun season memories, said Willy: “It’s our favorite tradition, and seeing everyone have so much fun while dancing and playing makes me so happy.” Admittedly, I did tear up when I read the final line of his message: “In short, my favorite memory is watching my closest friends do something they love.”\n\nIt would be a disservice to reflect on the season the Marching Virginians have had without acknowledging the history that came with it. September 9th’s football game against Purdue, appropriately dubbed “The Rain Game,” was truly one for the ages. Those present at the game know just how unprecedented the day was: a weather delay, a near-cancellation, and almost 6 hours of confused loitering in the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility later, the Marching Virginians represented their school with pride and strength.\n\nWhen sophomore and saxophone rank captain Alex Shupp reached out to me to discuss his perspective on the day, I was elated. He called the day, which left so many marchers and fans drenched, his favorite experience as a Marching Virginian thus far: “This might be a controversial pick, but my favorite memory with the Marching Virginians has to go to the September 9th rained out football game. It was the most hectic, stressful, and by far the longest day of the entire season. But for all its downsides, it cemented itself as a core representation of who the MVs are.”\n\n“Yeah, it was miserable, wet, and frustrating when the game got delayed. But the second the MVs huddled in the practice facility together, the band immediately started making the best of it…I wouldn’t have had that game play out any other way.”\n\nSo easy is it to fall into the idea that band is some kind of shift at a job, clocking in at 5:30 p.m. and leaving at 7:00 p.m. However, it is so much more than that. I quickly realized that some MV’s favorite experiences occurred outside of practice or even game days. Junior and marketing + communications officer Emy Delaporte spoke of how her most memorable moment from this season was her study sessions with fellow piccolos. “My favorite memories from this season are a series of late-night study sessions in Squires with pix players,” she mentioned. “The overlapping subject areas made for great homework help and the chatter was immaculate!”\n\nComparatively, freshman trumpet player Taj Davis spoke of how a casual movie hangout at senior trumpet Kerin Gorassi’s house set the tone for his season: “…One of the first real events we did was a movie night, planned by Kerin. It was a very nice way for any and all new members to meet the rest of the section in a non-professional scenario…[his planning] was very nice to see, and is probably why I and the many other freshman trumpets have such high respect for him!”\n\nIt’s been one heck of a first season. Truthfully, I’m not sure any other season could really top what the band as a collective has done this year. Reading the memories of my fellow marchers made me realize how much of a good decision I made to take the leap and try out for the band. The experiences I’ve had this one season alone make me more and more excited for possible seasons to come, and as we close out this one with a bowl game, I’m ready to perform and make music with my new adoptive family of 330 strong. Cheers to the 50th year of the Marching Virginians!"
