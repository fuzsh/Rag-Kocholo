        "text": "In 1886, the French neurologist Pierre Marie (1853-1940; fig. 1) first coined the term ‘acromegaly' (initially also known as ‘Marie's malady') and linked it to a distinct clinical disease with a characteristic clinical picture. He wrote (in French): ‘A condition characterised by hypertrophy of the hands, feet and the face exists which we propose to be called “acromegaly” which means hypertrophy of the extremities. In reality the extremities are swollen during the disease course and their increase in volume is the most characteristic feature of this disease. Acromegaly is different from myxoedema, Paget's disease or leontiasis ossea of Virchow' [1].\n\nHowever, Pierre Marie was not the first physician to give a full record of the clinical picture of acromegaly [2]. Others had preceded him already years before, like the Dutch physician Johannes Wier (1515?-1588) in 1567 (fig. 2). He described (in Latin) a female giant he had seen in one of the earliest medical reports on this disorder: ‘Moreover in this treatise it is not proper that I should pass over a rare and memorable history, worthy of explanation. I saw a virgin who, because of the gigantic size of her body, travelled to cities in various regions and in those places exhibited herself in hired buildings to all who paid an offering, from which collections she and her mother sought a livelihood. I also, having entered [to see her], inquired by diligent questions and I learned from her replies and those of her mother that she was born of parents both of whom were of short stature and that none of her ancestors exceeded the ordinary height of men and that this girl from the time of her birth to her twelfth year was of small stature: but at the time when she had reached her fourteenth year and had struggled with her menses for some time, they suddenly ceased and she began to increase in size, all of her members proportionately formed so that nothing seemed unusual. Unless I am mistaken, when I saw her she was in the twenty-fifth year from the time she had noticed the cessation of her flowing. Nature required that bloody excrement to nourish and conserve so great a mass. She enjoyed good health in the meantime, her form was not attractive, her temperament was simple and stupid and her whole body was sluggish. The physical qualities which God had infused into her body in the beginning, while sufficient for a body of ordinary size, when dispersed afterwards in that vast mass of flesh could not show themselves with the same strength as they would in a body of ordinary size' [3]. Meanwhile, as shown, Johannes Wier also gave an interesting speculation as to the cause of her amenorrhea.\n\nIn 1772, the French surgeon Nicolas Saucerotte (1741-1841) gave to the French Academy of Surgery a report on a 39-year-old man with a good clinical description fitting with acromegaly [4,5]. Other physicians had also given the disorder different names. In 1822, the French dermatologist Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert (1768-1837) called it ‘Géant scrofuleux' [6]. In 1864, the Italian neurologist-psychiatrist Andrea Verga (1811-1895) called it ‘Prosopo-ectasia' (enlargement of the face; fig. 3) [7]. He wrote (in Italian) a report on an acromegalic female he had seen: ‘Since 1860, while visiting the chronic patients admitted to the Church of Santa Maria ai Nuovi Sepolcri, one of the houses subsidiary to the Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, I had been impressed by the look of one patient [Maria B., born in Milan], whose waxen pallor and disproportionately large face was almost frightening. The personnel serving in this Hospital must have been similarly impressed, as they had nicknamed the woman “big-face”. Seeing that I was staring at her, she told me how she once had not been ugly and looked just like other girls'. This quote from a scientific paper again shows that notwithstanding their intelligence and respectful positions, these investigators-clinicians in the early years were far less scientific, critical and careful with respect to their, nowadays completely unacceptable, statements regarding the beauty and intelligence of patients suffering from acromegaly or gigantism [8,9]. In 1862, the patient died at the age of 59 from typhus, and a post-mortem examination was performed by Verga. He found a walnut-sized sellar tumour with displacement of the optic nerves. The normal pituitary gland was not found. He discussed whether the normal pituitary gland had disappeared because of the pressure from the tumour or whether the tumour itself was a degeneration of the gland. In 1868, the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909) called the disorder ‘macrosomia' [10,11,12]. In 1877, the French physician Henri Henrot (1838-1919) published an autopsy report on a patient with gigantism, in whom a sellar tumour was found [13,14]. In 1877, the Italian physician Vincenzo Brigidi described the case, including the autopsy, of the acromegalic Italian actor Ghirlenzoni (fig. 4) [15]. Vincenzo Brigidi wrote (in Italian): ‘... unfortunately, he [Ghirlenzoni] could not speak clearly, on account of the excessive size of his tongue ... the rest of the face had more the appearance of an ape than a man. It was lengthened, with very marked prognathism, flattened and indented laterally, as if the cheeks had been elevated by a blow from the hatchet on each side' [15]. Ghirlenzoni attempted to drown himself, but was rescued. He was carried to the hospital delirious, lapsed into a coma and died the next day. Vincenzo Brigidi diagnosed the clinical condition as ‘rheumatitis deformans'. At autopsy, he found a hypertrophied pituitary gland. He also performed the first microscopic examination of a pituitary tumour [15].\n\nFinally, in 1886, Pierre Marie described two female patients with acromegaly whom he had seen for Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) in the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. The first case was that of a 37-year-old woman (fig. 5). He wrote (in French): ‘... It was at the age of twenty-four, when her menstruation suddenly ceased, that she noticed the sudden increase in her hands. At this time her face also underwent changes … so that when the patient returned home, none of her relatives could recognize her .... The whole feet are large, including the toes. Though the latter are increased in size, they have preserved their form, there is no true deformity, their appearance is simply that of a very big person .... The tongue is enlarged .... The sight is also slightly defective .... The cranial vertex is of nearly the same size as the end of the chin. The lower jaw is well-developed ...'. He also wrote: ‘The patient's thirst is intense and in order to satisfy this, it is obliging her to beg tea of her friends. The quantity of urine is enormous ...' [1]. So, did Marie also report diabetes insipidus, or diabetes mellitus here? The second case was that of a 54-year-old woman. Marie wrote (in French): ‘The rims of the orbits are very thick, also the frontal eminences, making between them and the upper border of the malar bone a deep depression, … The nose is large. The lower jaw is very thick …' [1].\n\nInitially, it was also believed that acromegaly and gigantism were two totally different diseases. Pierre Marie [18,19,20,21,22,23,24], his Brazilian intern José Dantas (de) Souza-Leite [16] and the French neurologist Georges Guinon (1859-1932) [35] were convinced that acromegaly and gigantism were two entirely different disorders. Gigantism was considered as an exaggerated variant of normal development, whereas acromegaly was considered as a pathological condition. However, in 1884, Christian F. Fritsche (1821-1898) and the German pathologist T.A. Edwin Klebs (1834-1913) [36], supported by the work published in 1872 by the Austrian anatomist Karl Langer, Ritter von Edenberg (1819-1887) [37], concluded that, in contrast to gigantism, which they considered as a congenital disorder, acromegaly was an acquired variety of gigantism occurring at a later age when growth is completed.\n\nIn 1894, the Austrian internist Maximilian Sternberg (1863-1934) concluded that there were many similarities between acromegaly and gigantism [38]. However, in 1897 he changed his view and agreed with Pierre Marie and others that both disorders were different [39]. In 1891, the Scottish physician Daniel John Cunningham (1850-1909) pointed to the connection between acromegaly and gigantism. He did so after having studied the skeleton of the Irish giant Cornelius Magrath (1736-1760, 2.26 m, 7 ft 5 in) from Tipperary. This skeleton is in the possession of Trinity college, Dublin [40,41,42] (fig. 7). In 1893, the American neurologist Charles L. Dana (1852-1935) [43] and, in 1895, the English-born physician Woods Hutchinson (1862-1930) [44] concluded the same. In 1895, the French physician and pathologist Édouard Brissaud (1852-1909) and the French neurologist Henry Meige (1866-1940) described the case report of the French acromegalic giant Jean-Pierre Mazas (1847-1901, 2.30 m, 7 ft 6½ in). They also concluded that acromegaly and gigantism coexisted in the same person [45,46]. Jean-Pierre Mazas was also known as ‘the giant of Montastruc' from Monastruc, Haute-Garonne, France (fig. 8). Édouard Brissaud and Henry Meige were, like Pierre Marie, both pupils of Jean-Martin Charcot at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. It gradually became evident that both disorders had the same pathogenetic mechanism but were different as to the age of onset. Gigantism would occur much earlier in life, when the skeleton still had the potency to grow, a developmental phase we now call pre-pubertal [45,46,47].\n\nFinally, the cause of acromegaly and gigantism, a pituitary adenoma hyper-secreting growth hormone (GH), became known in the early years of the 20th century [48]. But even in the 21st century, scientific interest into gigantism (and Charles Byrne) has led to new discoveries. In 2010, Harvinder S. Chahal et al. [49] from the UK extracted DNA from a tooth of the skeleton of the Irish giant Charles Byrne in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London and identified a germline mutation in the aryl hydrocarbon-interacting protein gene (AIP). Four contemporary Northern Irish families who presented with gigantism, acromegaly, or prolactinoma had the same mutation and haplotype associated with the mutated gene. Using coalescent theory, they came to the conclusion that these persons shared a common ancestor who lived about 57-66 generations earlier [49,50].\n\nFour years earlier, Vierimaa et al. [51] from Finland discovered that AIP mutations accounted for 16% of patients diagnosed with GH-secreting pituitary adenomas. AIP is a typical example of a low-penetrance tumour susceptibility gene. More recently, it has been demonstrated that pituitary adenomas in patients with AIP mutations show clinical features that may negatively impact treatment outcomes. Furthermore, there is a predisposition for aggressive pituitary tumours in AIP mutation-positive young patients with acromegaly, or gigantism [52]. Recently, microduplication on chromosome Xq26.3 in samples from 13 patients with gigantism has been found. These microduplications are generated during chromosome replication and contain 4 protein-coding genes. Only one of these genes, GPR101, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor, was overexpressed in patients' pituitary lesions. This pediatric disorder was named X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) [53]. Interestingly, already in 1912, Harvey Cushing in his monograph The Pituitary Body and Its Disorders [54] had hinted at ‘Mendelian tendencies' in 2 patients with familial gigantism (case XIII, surgical No. 27784, pp 89-92 and case XXXI, surgical No. 27011½, pp 158-162)."
