        "text": "Recommended bets\n\n[RECOMMENDED_BETS]\n\n19 of Atlético’s 32 La Liga, Champions League and Supercopa matches this season, 59%, have seen both teams score. Manchester United meanwhile have kept just three clean sheets in their last 12 fixtures.\n\nSo, both teams to score is 10/11.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has scored 25 goals in his career against Atlético, including four hat-tricks. He is 9/2 to break the deadlock and 8/5 to add to his tally.\n\nMatch preview\n\nVillarreal v Manchester United – UEFA Champions League CASTELLON, SPAIN – NOVEMBER 23: Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United during the UEFA Champions League match between Villarreal v Manchester United at the Estadio de la Ceramica on November 23, 2021 in Castellon Spain (Photo by David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)\n\nFor the first time since a Cup Winners Cup tie in 1991, Atlético Madrid and Manchester United go head-to-head.\n\nBack then in a second round encounter, the Spanish side beat the competition’s holders 4-1 on aggregate, featuring a thumping 3-0 victory at the Calderón.\n\nThese days, the competition is different, the venue is different and world football in general is unrecognisable, but the desperation to continue in Europe remains the same.\n\nDiego Simeone’s side are well-known for being a well-organised, defensive unit, conceding just 25 La Liga goals en route to the title last season.\n\nHowever, already in this campaign, los Colchoneros have shipped 34 league goals, meaning they have the joint-12th best defence in Spain.\n\nSaturday’s impressive 3-0 victory over Osasuna at El Sadar was much needed but it leaves them fifth, below Barcelona on goal difference.\n\nIn Europe, they only won twice but that was enough to take second spot in Group B, ousting A.C. Milan and Porto with wins in Italy and Portugal.\n\nIn history, Atleti have won ten of their last 12 knockout ties against English opponents, but did lose to Chelsea at this juncture 12 months ago.\n\nWill the Spanish champions build a first leg advantage on home turf?\n\nManchester United meanwhile have won this competition on three occasions, but have only won in this round twice since their last final 11 years ago.\n\nThey topped Group F, above Villarreal, Atalanta and BSC Young Boys, with seven of their 11 points won in the final 11 minutes of matches.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scoring two stoppage time winners at Old Trafford and a last-minute equaliser in Bergamo.\n\nIn the Premier League, Ralf Rangnick’s side beat rivals Leeds United 4-2 on Sunday so remain fourth in the table.\n\nHowever, if this isn’t to be a fifth successive tropheyless campaign, Manchester United need be crowned champions of Europe on 28 May.\n\nBoth sides are very unpredictable so that should lead to a fascinating encounter at the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nAtlético Madrid team news\n\nClub Atletico de Madrid v FC Barcelona – La Liga Santander MADRID, SPAIN – OCTOBER 02: Luis Suárez of Atletico Madrid celebrates with Rodrigo De Paul after scoring their team’s second goal during the La Liga match between Club Atletico de Madrid and FC Barcelona at Estadio Wanda Metropolitano on October 02, 2021 in Madrid, Spain. (Photo by Denis Doyle/Getty Images)\n\nDiego Simeone’s squad is not at full strength right now and this will certainly hamper their chances in this tie.\n\nYannick Ferreira Carrasco’s red card at Estádio do Dragão on matchday six means he misses out through suspension.\n\nElsewhere, at right-back, Daniel Wass joined from Valencia in January, to replace Kieran Trippier, but then got injured on his debut at Camp Nou.\n\nFurther forward, Thomas Lemar and Matheus Cunha are also out while Antoine Griezmann was back on the bench on Saturday having last featured on 6 January.\n\nJoão Félix and Luis Suárez, the strike duo who started and both scored at Osasuna, would both miss the Old Trafford leg if booked.\n\nThe good news is that Rodrigo De Paul will return after missing that game in Pamplona due to yellow card accumulation.\n\nAt full-back, January signing Reinildo will keep his place on the left with Šime Vrsaljko deputising for Wass.\n\nDespite all the big names, Ángel Correa is the top scorer having netted 12 so far this season.\n\nManchester United team news\n\nWest Ham United v Manchester United – Premier League – London Stadium Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard (centre) celebrates scoring their side’s second goal of the game with Cristiano Ronaldo (right) during the Premier League match at the London Stadium, London. Picture date: Sunday September 19, 2021. (Photo by Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nFor the visitors, no one is suspended nor is anyone treading the tightrope of being one booking away from missing the return meeting.\n\nDavid de Gea will start in goal against the side he joined as a 13 year old, hoping for his 19th Champions League clean sheet.\n\nRaphaël Varane, who won 18 trophies across the city with Real Madrid, could be back in after pulling out of the Brighton game in the warm up.\n\nOver at right-back, Aaron Wan-Bissaka started in the league for only the third time under Rangnick on Sunday, but Diogo Dalot may well return.\n\nJesse Lingard was another surprise inclusion at Elland Road, so it’ll be interesting to see if Marcus Rashford is back in for this one.\n\nPaul Pogba in contrast has started every match since returning from injury so may well keep his place over Fred.\n\nOne guaranteed starter is Jadon Sancho, who scored in Spain against Villarreal in November and netted against Atlético during his time with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nEdinson Cavani is a doubt but, either-way, Cristiano Ronaldo will lead the line, having only scored more times against Sevilla then Atleti.\n\nThe last two occasions Ronaldo’s team has met them in a Champions League knockout tie, he’s scored a hat-trick in the second leg.\n\nPremier League table:"
