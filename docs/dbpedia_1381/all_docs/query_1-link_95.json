        "text": "Late Twentieth Century accounts of art history reveal crises across different artistic disciplines. More recently, the deepest recession since the Great Depression has destabilised the globe. These combined instances of turbulence and conflict shape the context of this research. Using different concepts of instability this study attempts to locate specific images, in art and in a wider cultural sphere, which demonstrate a strong connection to the concerns and processes of my own art practice. In order to do this I explore recurring examples of collapse through assorted definitions of its ‘image’. A description of collapse involving the English comedian Tommy Cooper, together with its transposition into a stilled photographic image, forms the fundamental basis of this study. I utilise this image of Cooper’s collapse to articulate a form of instability, both in terms of its physical appearance and the less apparent meanings made visible as a consequence. Examined in relation to uncertainty through illustrations of symbolic and ‘real’ death the signatures of collapse are then further explored in a variety of image studies throughout this thesis. These examples are then used to ascertain how meanings are constructed, transmitted and repeated through the image. Combining phenomenal accounts with firsthand interview material, a detailed case study of the artist Mike Nelson is used to advance this enquiry and to situate a comparative assessment of my own practice. These findings help to support a transferable system of image reproduction across different representational categories as the formula for a fragmented compositional strategy in my work. The results uphold the theory of a shift from art-history into image-history, whereby artworks in different mediums take on some form of equivalence. This then is the definition of my working processes, realised through the reproduction of different ‘image forms’ manifest as interspersed arrangements of (art) objects and other image components.\n\nThe repetition phenomenon characterizes each aspect of our daily life, from the cellular mitosis in the microscopic field, to the day’s cycles with its routines (breakfast, lunch and dinner), to the year with the seasons and the life with its continuous untangling between birth and death. We are so dipped in repetition phenomena and driven by iterative rhythms that barely everything vanishes in an indistinctive magma . The repetition is a changeable tool, subjected to different interpretations and uses. In the first part (“What’s the repetition?”) we will remind how that is a extraordinary educative tool, the imitation of gestures and sounds it’s the base behavior to learn something, but also stylistic if we consider the use of the language. In “Repetition, difference” we will consider the repetition value as difference, analyzing in short the practice of the epic poetry in the ancient Greece. A cyclic repetition, where the version is similar but not the same as its former. And it’s exactly the difference that makes the repetition a creative tool. In fact the difference brings to the “invention”, without it, every part would remain the same, simply generating a repetition. In the subsequent part (“Repetition, sameness”) will emerge the role that the technology has taken to condition the repetition concept and to transform it from creative tool to an alienation instrument that form and deform us. In “Originality, creation”, we try to identify the characters of the contemporary creativity, a creativity where the concept of origin doesn’t make sense anymore, but everything is pushed through a different where the copy of something else generates an “another” From the practice of the Kata to the mantra recitation, in the eastern culture the people live in a more serene way the repetition idea. In the western culture, repetition is often a synonym of boredom, a real sequence of planned actions, a sort of cage, for a society continuously searching for innovations. Our main instrument for the innovation search is the remix, the restoring on cycle with a new formatting (“Re-cycle, the re-mix: the computer talent”): thanks to the strong expansion of the computerized instruments, we are living a redefinition of the repetitiveness on creative way. While in the classic experience where there’s continuity with the tradition, our contemporary is more an idea of copy and paste to create cultural Frankensteins. One of the art that conditions and represents our present the most, where there’s a continuous use of these repetition practices, is the cinema world, we close then with a little window hunting for remakes, quotes and clones.\n\nThis Ph.D by Practice narrates five spatial paintings that took place over three years, between 2014 and 2017, across a range of sites and exhibition spaces in the UK. This series of work and written thesis seeks to understand what a new materialist reading could bring to painting’s language once it enters architectural space. Each painting uses fragments of both made and found things, that are closely interrelated with painting’s vernacular: edges; translucency; colour; thickness; proximity; etc. These are theatrically staged with space itself - where architectural space becomes complicit with the work. It is the viewer/reader who makes the work do its work, from within the painting, through being in-action with the works as a physical spatial encounter, examining thematics of visibility and invisibility through the concrete materialization of the structures that govern painting. The thesis argues how the experience of painting as a spatial practice requires new interpretative meth...\n\nON REPEAT: The Art of Repetition explores how my artistic practice, spanning nearly 25 years, has worked directly with ideas connected to the term ‘repetition' across many creative forms. It explores how I have made use of repetition within durational and time-based artwork such as performance art and poetry film as well as working in ‘static’ work, in installation art. Underpinning much of the work explored here is the idea that by working directly with repetition, over a long duration and then interrupting that repetitive activity in some way, new forms of practice can emerge, and subsequently new knowledge can be discovered through that disruption of habit. It can also be said that by interrupting a repetitive activity like a habit or something that has become routine (sometimes without us even realising that we have become caught in a never-ending cycle of repetition) by its disruption, through what Arthur Koestler (1970) refers to creative acts, we can create a space for critical self-reflection and ultimately emancipation. This article proposes how my work can be seen, in light of Koestler’s claim, as contributing to those ‘creative acts’. But is there also a space where repetition and habit can be comforting in their familiarity (and ultimately, control)?"
