        "text": "Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc in French) has inspired artistic and cultural works for nearly six centuries. The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture. The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog. Lesser known works, particularly from early periods, are not included. In this article, many of the excluded items are derivative of better known representations. For instance, Friedrich Schiller's 1801 play The Maid of Orleans inspired at least 82 different dramatic works during the nineteenth century, and Verdi's and Tchaikovsky's operatic adaptations are still recorded and performed. Most of the others survive only in research libraries. As another example, in 1894, Émile Huet listed over 400 plays and musical works about Joan of Arc. Despite a great deal of scholarly interest in Joan of Arc, no complete list of artistic works about her exists, although a 1989 doctoral dissertation did identify all relevant films including ones for which no copy survives.[1]\n\nPortrayals of Joan of Arc are numerous. For example, in 1979 the Bibliothèque Municipale in Rouen, France displayed a gallery containing over 500 images and other items related to Joan of Arc. The story of Joan of Arc was a popular subject for dramatization in the 1940s. In addition to Maxwell Anderson's play Joan of Lorraine and the Ingrid Bergman film Joan of Arc, there was also the 1948 RKO film The Miracle of the Bells starring Fred MacMurray, Alida Valli, and Frank Sinatra, about a dying film actress whose first and last role is Joan of Arc. There were also three radio dramatizations of the story of Joan during those years, one of them specifically written with a World War II framework.\n\nSaint Joan by George Bernard Shaw, 1923 play\n\nLachmi Bai, the Joan of Arc of India, by 'Michael White. Lachmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, a major leader of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was like Joan of Arc a courageous warrior woman, admired as a heroine after her death.\n\nLalla Fatma N'Soumer, the Kabile woman who led a prolonged resistance to the French conquest of Algeria, was respected and honored by her French foes as \"The Alegerian Jeanne d'Arc\" or \"La Jeanne d'Arc du Djurdjura\". Like Joan of Arc, Lalla Fatma N'Soumer was a notable religious leader as well as a political and military one. (Here shown in a famous painting by Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux).\n\nDate Title Author Notes 1429 \"Chanson en l'honneur de Jeanne d'Arc\" Christine de Pizan An elegiac poem written during Joan's lifetime. The author's final work. English translation available: [4]. 1435 Histoire du Siège d'Orléans Anonymous (possibly Jacques Millet) First performed in Orléans four years after Joan's death. The surviving version appears to be a revision from circa 1450. God and several saints play major roles in this sprawling drama with more than 100 speaking parts. after 1435 Ballade François Villon Part of Le Testament, Villon calls Joan \"the good (woman from) Lorraine whom the English burned in Rouen\". 1590 Henry VI, Part 1 William Shakespeare Drawn from 16th century English sources, Joan begins with the appearance of piety but soon proves to be a cunning witch justly executed. Project Gutenberg text: [5]. 1756 La Pucelle des Oranges Voltaire A mock epic poem that explores typically Voltairean themes deriding mysticism as humbug. Wikisource text (in French): [6] 1796 Joan of Arc Robert Southey An epic poem 1801 Die Jungfrau von Orleans Friedrich Schiller In literary rebuttal to Voltaire, Schiller creates a sympathetic Joan as a Romantic heroine. A magic helmet renders her invincible until she falls in love, and is killed in battle rather than being burned at the stake. This drama was the basis of Tchaikovsky's opera of the same name.

Translated into English as The Executioner's Knife or Joan of Arc: A Tale of the Inquisition by Daniel De Leon (1910) 1894 La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc Thérèse of Lisieux The first of two 'pious recreations' written by the Saint; \"small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days.\" Performed at the Carmel on 21 January 1894, it featured Thérèse in the title role. The script, which focuses more heavily upon Joan's interaction with her visions, has since been widely circulated with Saint Thérèse's writings, as has that of its sequel. 1895 Jeanne d'Arc Accomplit Sa Mission Thérèse of Lisieux Sequel to La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc, this was performed exactly one year later, 21 January 1895. Again featuring Thérèse as Joan, its focus is upon her martyrdom. In the estimation of Thérèse's biographer, Ida Görres, the two plays \"are scarcely veiled self-portraits.\" 1896 Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc Mark Twain This work is little remembered yet in Mark Twain's own opinion was his finest work.
