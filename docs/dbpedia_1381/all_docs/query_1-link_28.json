        "text": "Wasserman’s Industry-Leading Brands & Properties Division Enhances Creative and Experiential Service Offerings in Canada\n\nGlobal sports, music and culture agency Wasserman has acquired Toronto-based creative and experience agency trevor//peter, announced today by Wasserman Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Canada, Steve Marshman.\n\nEstablished in 2008, trevor//peter is a lifestyle brand agency that helps clients and their audience connect through shared passion points to build brand affinity and drive engagement. The team of approximately 50 staff members offers a unique mix of disciplines across brand strategy, creative, digital and experiential that together fuel participation by identifying the wants of audiences directly from the community.\n\nAs part of Wasserman, trevor//peter will provide complementary offerings across the shared passion points of sports, music and entertainment; a deep understanding of culture within the greater marketing landscape; and a dedication to enhancing audience experience. With clients across music, sports, gaming, food and fashion, the team will collaborate with Wasserman’s market-leading team in Toronto on a number of shared clients including RBC and Diageo, while adding new clients including Red Bull, DHL, Spotify, HOKA, UGG and the Canadian Football League to Wasserman’s roster.\n\nTrevor//peter founder Chris Cook will continue in his role as President of trevor//peter, reporting into Marshman and working alongside Senior Vice President, Canada Alan Palmer and VP Operations, Canada Linsey Ferguson as part of Wasserman’s global brand & property marketing division.\n\n“As Wasserman continues to expand both geographically and in terms of service offerings, growing our presence in the Canadian market remains a key part of our global strategy,” said Marshman. “We are excited to enhance our suite of services by adding trevor//peter’s localized expertise, creative capabilities and extensive network of community leaders. The key to this partnership coming together was a commitment to shared values and being ‘people-first,’ which was a critical component from day one of our discussions. This is a great fit for Wasserman, but more importantly, it is great for the clients we serve.”\n\n“We love to make brand plays happen, to get brands involved and to take them beyond what they sell to where they should show up and hang out,” said Cook. “This is where Wasserman thrives as well, using a complementary set of skills and expertise that we are eager to tap into. We are jointly strengthening our ability to further connect brands to audiences, talent to fans and people to passions. We’re really pumped to get going and to be part of the Wasserman global family.” Wasserman’s investment in the Canadian market dates back 12 years, with its Toronto office officially opening in 2011. Since then, the company’s industry-leading presence across the country has grown significantly:\n\n• 2012: Acquired Catalyst Sponsorship Consulting, Inc., of which Marshman was Founder and CEO.\n\n• 2018: Launched Wasserman Hockey practice via a significant equity interest in Orr Hockey Group, LLP.\n\n• 2021: Acquired Riddle & Bloom (now Wasserman Next Gen), activating on high school and college campuses across Canada and North America.\n\n• 2021: Acquired prominent Canadian hockey agent Rich Evans and his Western Canada-based agency, Points West.\n\nWasserman Canada’s brand consulting and advisory practice is a partner to some of the country’s leading brands such as RBC, Molson Coors, Air Canada, Home Depot, Shaw Communications, Skip The Dishes and Sun Life Assurance. Additionally, the company’s Canadian property consulting group advises the country’s top sports and entertainment franchises, including Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, NHLPA, the Canadian Olympic Committee, LIVE NATION, True North Sports & Entertainment, OVG, Tennis Canada, the Greater Toronto Airport Authority and Metrolinx.\n\nWasserman’s talent roster across sports, music and entertainment features Canadian-born athletes such as Natalie Achonwa, Luguentz Dort, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jordyn Huitema, Connor McDavid, Kailen Sheridan and Nick Suzuki; and artists including Alessia Cara, Barenaked Ladies, Drake, Daniel Caesar, Kaytranada, Shawn Mendes and Zeds Dead. Throughout its 20-year history, the company has deliberately and strategically grown its worldwide presence through both targeted acquisitions and organic growth, establishing itself as one of the world’s leading companies in the areas of brand & property marketing and sports & music talent representation.\n\n—\n\nAbout Wasserman\n\nWasserman is a partner to the world’s most iconic sports figures, musical artists, brands and properties. Our purpose is to transform and advance brands, businesses and careers, empowering clients to create culture and impact audiences.\n\nWasserman’s brand & property marketing division serves the broader ecosystem of entities in sports, music and entertainment by crafting strategic ideas, partnerships and experiences that connect brands, properties and fans."
