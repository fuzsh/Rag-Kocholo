        "text": "Opinion\n\n“Shangri-La?”\n\nDemocrat politicians are quick to insist that “ordinary citizens” don’t need “weapons of war” nor “high-capacity” magazines.\n\nThey love cynical sound-bites like, “No one needs ten bullets to kill a deer” (as if we were even talking about sport shooting).\n\nYet, at the same moment, leftists are mouthing such dishonest platitudes, they themselves are being protected by legions of tax-payer-funded bodyguards, all of whom are carrying “weapons of war” and “high-capacity magazines,” the exact same weapons these sleazy gas-bags simultaneously insist the rest of us don’t “need.”\n\nTo rationalize their nauseating hypocrisy, we’re told that modern VCAs [violent criminal actors] are “more sophisticated” and “better armed” than criminals of the past, and therefore, police (and political bodyguards) “need” modern weapons (“of war”), all of which are equipped with “high-capacity magazines.” So that they (police) are adequately equipped to face these dangerous and sophisticated felons.\n\nThey curiously make no suggestion with regard to what “ordinary” citizens are supposed to do when facing an identical threat!\n\nAre we to believe that all these “more violent, better-armed criminals,” whom police have to deal with, somehow don’t prey on private citizens, too?\n\nWhy is it that politicians apparently “deserve” protection afforded by “weapons of war” and “high-capacity magazines,” but the rest of us don’t?\n\nI think it is fair to assume that VCAs don’t abide by notions of “fairness” and “reasonableness!”\n\nPoliticians are right when they tell us that violent crime is on an exponential increase, and their response is to quickly and dramatically increase the level of protection …but only for themselves!\n\nYet, all this violent mayhem “trickles down” to private citizens, too, doesn’t it? Citizens who don’t enjoy continuous protection from dedicated and heavily armed bodyguards. It is fiction to suggest that any particular neighborhood or person is “special” and that “bad things” happen in other places and to other people.\n\nThis is the naive “Shangri-La Fantasy,” and it causes citizens to foolishly believe leftist rhetoric, the false narrative that dangerous trends will never impact “us” directly.\n\nThe sage doesn’t believe that rubbish for a moment and arm themselves appropriately!\n\n“In an instant, it became clear to me that all the courage in the world could not withstand this firepower!” ~ A young Charles de Gaulle, in 1914.\n\n/John\n\nAbout John Farnam & Defense Training International, Inc\n\nAs a defensive weapons and tactics instructor, John Farnam will urge you, based on your beliefs, to make up your mind about what you would do when faced with an imminent lethal threat.
