        "text": "Owners of the N.F.L.’s 31 other teams unanimously approved the sale of the Washington Commanders to a group led by Josh Harris, the private equity billionaire, who agreed to pay a record $6.05 billion to Daniel Snyder, the scandal-plagued owner of the team.\n\nThe figure surpassed the previous highest price paid for an American sports team, the $4.65 billion a group led by the Walmart heir Rob Walton paid last year for the Denver Broncos. The Commanders transaction is expected to formally close as early as Friday. Snyder bought the team in 1999 for $800 million.\n\n“Josh will be a great addition to the N.F.L.,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement announcing the vote, adding, “I know he has a commitment to winning on the field, but also to running an organization that everyone will be proud of — and to making positive contributions in the community.”\n\nThe vote, taken at an ad hoc, one-day meeting in Minneapolis, will allow Harris and his group to take control of one of the league’s cornerstone franchises, which under Snyder had endured years of losses on the field and bouts of chaos off it. Harris has a track record of improving the standings of the other professional teams he owns, the Philadelphia 76ers of the N.B.A. and the New Jersey Devils of the N.H.L.\n\nHarris and his group will focus on improving the team’s tattered image and explore options for repairing or replacing FedEx Field, the team’s home since 1997. The franchise owns land in Maryland and Virginia, the location of its training facility. But many N.F.L. team owners prefer that the Commanders build a new stadium in the District of Columbia, where the team played for most of its history.\n\n“This franchise is part of who I am and who I’ve become as a person,” Harris said, noting that he grew up rooting for the team in nearby Chevy Chase, Md. “A new era of Washington football is here.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
