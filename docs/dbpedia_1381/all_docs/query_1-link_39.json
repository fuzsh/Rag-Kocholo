        "text": "Applications are open for Summer Scholars 2024!\n\nHow to Apply\n\nApplications are due on March 15, 2024 for the Summer Scholars 2024 Program.\n\nStudents and faculty complete the linked three-part online application together.\n\nPart I, completed by the faculty-student(s) team, includes a project summary, description of dissemination goals, and a detailed timeline (see template below).\n\nPart II, completed by the faculty member, includes a brief statement of how the proposed project will help meet scholarship expectations and additional details (e.g., other responsibilities, sources of funding).\n\nFinally, each student applicant completes Part III, which includes a brief statement describing their interest in project and qualifications for engaging in this work.\n\nDownload Timeline Template (Word)\n\nDissemination Plan Examples\n\nTimeline Examples\n\nScience - Janzen\n\nSocial Science - West\n\nScience - Ha (GHR Funded)\n\nHumanities - Carpenter\n\nThe Summer Scholars program provides support for undergraduate students and faculty from all disciplines to engage in collaborative research and creative work while immersed in a culture of scholarship.\n\nOur program has two primary objectives:\n\nProvide meaningful, rich experiences for students in which they make significant contributions to scholarship.\n\nProvide faculty with the resources and support they need to advance their program of research/scholarship.\n\nAbout the Summer Scholars Program\n\nSupport for Scholarship\n\nSummer Scholars supports faculty-student collaborations in all disciplines. Each team is typically comprised of one faculty member and one or two students. Compensation for faculty and students allows teams to focus on their scholarship during 10 weeks during the summer. Teams are also provided with training, support, and resources to facilitate the peer-reviewed dissemination of their scholarly work.\n\nCommunity of Scholars\n\nSummer Scholars establishes a supportive community of faculty and student scholars who learn from and support one another; this community of scholars is a critical part of the program. Students and faculty attend weekly workshops designed to support scholarship, professional, and personal development.\n\nStudent-faculty teams that include undergraduate students and ranked faculty members are eligible.\n\nStudents and faculty must complete an application together. Summer Scholars teams are typically one faculty member and one or two students.\n\nAll ranked faculty are eligible to apply. Adjunct faculty are not eligible for the program.\n\nStudents must be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program and have at least one semester left at St. Kate’s after completing the program to be eligible.\n\nSummer Scholars is an intensive 10-week immersive experience for both faculty and students and requires an investment in scholarship, mentoring, and group dialogue to create a strong cohort and culture of scholarship. Faculty must be available without conflicting professional or personal responsibilities that interfere with the ability to fully engage in the scholarly project, to effectively mentor the student collaborator(s), and to actively participate in Summer Scholars workshops and activities. Note that although Summer Scholars is a 10-week intensive summer program, your commitment is for the entire academic year, as students and mentors are expected to prepare for and present their work at a national conference during the academic year.\n\nStudents also need to demonstrate a commitment to the program by describing how they will manage their other obligations and meet the expectations of this program. Students can apply to work 20 hours/week and must commit to submitting an abstract to the National Conference on Undergraduate Research or discipline-specific conference or its equivalent.\n\nThe Summer Scholars program is committed to promoting collaborative scholarship across disciplines while supporting both faculty and students. Faculty who fully engage in the Summer Scholars program will be paid a summer stipend equivalent to one course overload. Students will be paid to work 20 hours per week.\n\nThe dissemination requirements (see above) require students and faculty to continue working on their scholarship during the academic year. While we strive to provide funding for students, we cannot guarantee that students will be paid in the fall (though we guarantee funding for travel to NCUR if abstracts are accepted). Faculty are paid for their work in the summer only.\n\nThis year, we are able to fund two additional Summer Scholars teams for projects that meet the following criteria:\n\nYour application must address one of the priorities of the GHR Foundation's investment in St. Kate's.\n\nThese core practice elements are\n\nInterprofessional Collaborative Practice (ICP)—when multiple health workers from different backgrounds work together with patients, families, carers, and communities to deliver the highest quality of care (WHO, 2010)\n\nCultural Fluency—ability to navigate the many dimensions of culture needed to build shared meaning and understanding with people from other cultures. It is comprised of several skills such as working with ambiguity, flexibility, respect, empathy and adaptability (Inoue, 2007)\n\nEcological Approach—grounded in the understanding that the conditions that result in individual health or illness arise out of the interaction between an individual’s traits and their physical and sociocultural environment and are influenced on multiple levels (e.g. intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and policy (Sallis & Owen, 2015).\n\nEach of the above is conceptualized and addressed within the contexts of global health, primary care, and senior living. If you are eligible, your team will be asked to answer a few additional questions\n\nAll students are expected to submit their work for presentation at a peer-reviewed venue (e.g., undergraduate or discipline-specific conference, gallery exhibit, performance) during academic year. Additionally, teams will be encouraged and supported in their efforts to publish their work in a peer-reviewed journal or the discipline equivalent. Students also are required to present their scholarship at either the St. Catherine University Fall Research Symposium or the Sr. Seraphim Gibbons Undergraduate Symposium.\n\nTeams conducting research with human participants need approval from the Institutional Review Board prior to beginning their scholarship. Projects that require IRB approval will be contingently accepted for Summer Scholars support until they have been approved.\n\nParticipants evaluate the Summer Scholars program and its components.\n\nStudents and mentors are asked to promote the program and connect with the community by sharing your Summer Scholars work. Teams may be asked to present their work to prospective students, University community members, donors, potential donors, and alumnae or to discuss the Summer Scholars program with them.\n\nAll teams must submit a final report following their Summer Scholars experience.\n\nStrategies Used in Minnesota for the Unwinding of Medicaid Post-Public Health Emergency: July 2023\n\nTimothy Schulz BA, Julie Sabo PhD, RN APRN, CNS, FCNS\n\nBuilding a Brighter World: A Young Person’s Guide to Public Health\n\nTara Harbo, Jade Lent, Meghan R.
