        "text": "Roman Mars:\n\nThis is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThis is Part Two. The 2018/2019 mini-stories episodes where I interview the staff about their favorite little design stories, and stories about the built world that don’t quite fill out an entire episode for whatever reason, but they are quintessential 99pi stories nonetheless.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWe have stolen artifacts, mythical alleys, detached U.S. territories; machines that bring joy to people’s lives and a 50-foot, screaming monster that we will burn to the ground. If you are ever in need of a conversation-starter, the mini-stories are our gift to you. Stay with us.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nUp first, producer Joe Rosenberg.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nOkay. Roman, imagine you’re watching a TV show set in New York, and let’s say it’s one of those buddy-cop comedies where they pair the rookie with the grizzled veteran.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOkay.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd it opens, let’s say, on a foot chase. You know?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThey’re closing in on their suspects, streets of Manhattan are whizzing by… Let me ask you: nine times out of 10, if the suspect ducks around a corner to get away from them, he usually ducks into a… What?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAn alley. Is that what you’re looking for?\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nYes! Okay, yeah, I’m kind of leading you on.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nYou are correct. Yeah, and now, imagine another episode, same television show. The rookie cop is woken in the middle of the night because there’s a fresh body. There’s been a murder, they need him at the crime scene. Now picture the crime scene, the police tape, chalk outline.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight, right. Sure.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nWhere is this crime scene?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat is definitely in an alley.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nCorrect! Yes. Again. And now, imagine… Humor me, just to complete the rule of three.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nIn another episode, the grizzled cop breaks up a drug deal. It’s going to be-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIn an alley, definitely.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nIn the alley. Right. And that’s just for a television crime procedural. I mean, imagine, say, all the roles an alley might play in a movie set in a New York restaurant.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSure, like if you’re a restaurant worker or a dishwasher, or you’re taking out the trash in the back alley.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nExactly.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou’re having a secret rendezvous in the back alley, totally. An alley is where things happen.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nRight, exactly. It’s all alley everything. But the point is that regardless of what’s happening in the film or the television show, all of these alley scenes help sell audiences on the same idea of New York, that New York is a city of 10,000 alleys.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nEach with its own secret history.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThere’s just one tiny problem with this, which is that there are no alleys in New York.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat can’t be true!\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nIt’s hard to wrap your mind around, because we’ve all been raised on this myth that New York has alleys. And there are some in the outer boroughs, but if you’ve spent time in Manhattan and you really search your memory, you will not remember passing by an alley.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nHuh. (contemplative)\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAt least, not a classic alley that leads between two streets, has the fire escape. Usually, maybe, at best, if there’s a glorified loading dock or something like that.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight, right. I can’t specifically remember one, you’re right. That seems amazing to me.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nRight. But proper alleys, they’re just not there.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo, why do I think there is, and then, why aren’t there? I guess is the question. Which is the right question?\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nRight, right. First, why aren’t there? And this is because when the city planners laid out the grid for Manhattan north of Houston Street in 1811, something called The Commissioners’ Plan, they purposefully did not include alleys. They figured that they didn’t need alleys, because they thought the high frequency of the east-west streets, which are much closer together to each other than the north-south streets, kind of obviated the need for shortcuts. Or anything else that might break up their wonderfully perfect grid.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nBut also, and this was probably the real motivation, it was a way to maximize real estate because this way, without any alleys cutting through the blocks, the landowners could squeeze in more housing, and the land was worth more. And after that, almost no alleys were built because, of course, why own an alley when you can own a larger building? So, the result is that today, Manhattan has, at best, a dozen things you might call alleys, but they’re all south of Canal Street in the oldest part of the city that was built before the grid.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow. That’s amazing. I mean, now that you mention it, the thing that I notice the most when I’m walking down the streets of New York is the piles and piles of trash, which, when I lived in Chicago, that’s put in the alley. That is not on the street.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nChicago is the antithesis. Chicago has something like 2,000 miles of alleys.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight. Totally.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd it’s just so key to the idea of that city, but in that case, it’s actually true. But it’s weird. A lot of people don’t put this, two and two, together, including New Yorkers. The myth of the New York alley is so pervasive that even a lot of native New Yorkers have fallen prey to it.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is just, I’d always ask people, fellow New Yorkers, I’d just say, “When was the last time you remember saying, ‘Ah, I really got to get somewhere, and the quickest way to get there would be to take the alley shortcut’?”\n\nNick Carr:\n\nBecause it’s not a thing. It’s only when you point it out to them, that they kind of step back and go, “Yeah, that’s right.”\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThis is Nick Carr, and he’s a film location scout who worked in New York for many years on films like War of the Worlds, Wolf of Wall Street, more recently, the new Ghostbusters, the Smurfs movie…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI didn’t know that had a Manhattan section.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nOh, you got to know this. Of course the Smurfs go to New York!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOkay!\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nI mean, what else would have happened when your television show’s turned into a movie?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIt makes sense, yeah.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nOr at least in the sequel, right? Anyways, Nick says that this belief that New York has alleys is the bane of his existence because he’ll tell a director, “You know, New York is not a city of alleys. New York does not have alleys.”\n\nNick Carr:\n\nBut if you were to tell a director that there are no alleys in New York, they’ll look at you like you have two heads, and think that you don’t know how to do your job.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nInvariably, he reluctantly winds up showing them the dozen or so alleys south of Canal Street.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nAnd I would think of the film-able alleys in New York that look like how you want them to look, I’d say it’s five or six.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd of those five or six, most of them are either privately-owned, so they’re very expensive to shoot in – or they have other permitting issues, logistical constraints, parking constraints – leaving only this one alley, just south of Canal Street and east of Broadway, in which almost everyone films.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd that is Cortlandt Alley, which is just… It is the alley.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd Cortlandt, you have to understand this, it’s the alley you’ve been seeing your entire life. You just don’t realize it.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nLet me show you some photos.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIt’s got the fire escapes, it’s got loading docks, it’s got bricks and graffiti, and it’s an alley! Really is. It is. It’s the perfect alley. It’s very archetypal.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThis is the photo. This is the one where I looked at it.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd I was like, “I have totally seen that alley!”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah! I’ve seen 300 Law & Order episodes with that alley!\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nYeah, exactly. And, yeah, it’s so archetypical to such a degree that if you walked by it, you wouldn’t actually notice it, because it would feel so intensely normal.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nIt’s almost like you’ve been there, you know? Even if you’d never set foot in it, you take it for granted, because you have already been there. So, I’m pretty sure that whenever the first time I walked down that alley, it might as well have been the hundredth time I walked down that alley.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nBut here’s where things get especially weird, because the reason Cortlandt looks like the Platonic ideal of a New York alley is precisely because it’s been used in so many movies.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd so, there’s this chicken-and-egg thing that happens where, once a filmmaker who wants to film a quote-unquote “classic New York alley scene” sees Cortlandt, they’re like, “This is perfect!”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat’s the one!\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd it lures them into contributing to this fantasy of New York.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nBecause when a director has a location in mind, he has created the perfect location in his head, and no location you ever find will ever match up to what it is, right? But Cortlandt is what you picture. The director pictures it in his head, and it’s not 80% of the way there; it’s not 90%; it’s 100% of what he had in mind. And that’s because the people, directors, see a version of New York in other movies and TV shows, and then go and want to recreate it when they do their own film in town.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nThe sad truth is that it’s sort of a stereotype that gets perpetuated from movie to movie.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAnd so, now Cortlandt is forever caught in this loop, to the point where it can seem like it’s, all it’s used for is filming by basically everyone, all the time.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nWhen I used to drive by, I mean, I swear to God, it was on a weekly basis. The Law & Order series would put a body in the alley every other week, but the thing is, they all did it. They all do it, and still do it. Every, every major crime show, cop show, superhero show, anything that is filmed in New York has filmed in Cortlandt. I would say that with 100% confidence.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nEven the one alley in Manhattan doesn’t really function as an alley. It’s basically a film set.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nYeah, exactly. And just to give you an idea of Hollywood’s… the degree to which it’s treated as a film set, and Hollywood’s zeal in pursuit of the Plutonic New York alley…\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nA story often calls for an alley to be filled with trash. It’s part of the classic concept.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nSince that’s part of the archetype. But of course, real trash and grime would be hazardous to the cast and crew, so the first thing they do is actually clean the alley, with pressure hoses, to the point where it’s pristine.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nAnd then, you buy movie trash, and movie trash is large plastic bags, like trash bags, that are filled with approved logo sort of trash. It’s generic milk bottles and cereal boxes. But I believe each bag of movie trash is about 40 to $60 a bag, so there’s an industry just in making alleys look like alleys.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nBut what especially kind of interests me about all this is that I think with some cities, we don’t really know much about them, so they get to be their own thing. There might be cliches about San Francisco or Chicago, but no one outside of San Francisco truly thinks they know the city.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nHmm.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nBut New York, perhaps more than any other city, in some sense, it belongs to everyone. Everyone feels that they know it.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight, because they’ve seen it in a million movies. It is America’s city to so many people, and it is “The City” to so many people, in and of itself.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nRight, and there’s a level of granularity when you talk about Uptown, Downtown.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nSoHo, Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn. There are more household names, in terms of the geography.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nTotally. No, that makes sense.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nIt’s also kind of like, people think they know it but they don’t. And the result is that, at some point, the idea of New York has overtaken the reality of New York. It kind of takes cultural precedent, even in the minds of a lot of New Yorkers who never realized New York has no alleys.\n\nNick Carr:\n\nAnd it’s just sad, because it’s almost like an actor that’s typecast, right? An actor that’s being asked to play the same old role, because, “Hey, you did that one role really, really well back in 1977! So, keep doing it for another 50 years.”\n\nNick Carr:\n\nAnd I just think movies are just so much more interesting when you portray the locations featured for what they are, and let them be a real character instead of just a backdrop.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAt any point in its film history, was it ever named or present as Cortlandt Alley?\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nAlmost never. But Nick says Men in Black 3 has a scene where Will Smith is tracking down an alien, and they actually do at least attempt to ID the alley properly.\n\nAgent J:\n\n“Knuckles, you know you’re not supposed to be north of Canal Street!”\n\nNick Carr:\n\nSo, he gets it wrong in that they’re south of Canal Street, but so close! So close.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWell, they tried.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThey did their best. They did their best.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI think that’s the most you can ask of Men in Black 3.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWell, thanks so much, Joe!\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThank you, Roman.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThis is so cool.\n\nJoe Rosenberg:\n\nThis has been a lot of fun.\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOkay, Sean. Composer Sean Real. What’s the story you have today?\n\nSean Real:\n\nWell, first, I want to ask you a question, Roman. You’ve never done karaoke?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI’ve never done karaoke.\n\nSean Real:\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI’ve played the singing parts of Guitar Hero. That’s almost karaoke!\n\nSean Real:\n\nAlmost.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nBut not as performative in a bar with strangers. I’ve never done that.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. Doesn’t count.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat’s fair.\n\nSean Real:\n\nI want to tell you about the person who invented the karaoke machine.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh!\n\nSean Real:\n\nHis name is Daisuke Inoue, and as you can imagine, he loves music.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOf course.\n\nSean Real:\n\nI read this interview with him, and I found out that he started working as a drummer when he was still a teenager in high school, and after he graduated, he was perpetually in a traveling band that did cabaret music for nine years. And I think that’s a really big achievement, but in his interview, he likes to kind of talk smack on himself.\n\nSean Real:\n\nHe says, “One night, I realized that no matter how much I practice, I could never be as good as someone with God-given talent.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh.\n\nSean Real:\n\n“And that was enough to change my life as a band man. And after nine years on the road, many tales and no regrets, I went home.”\n\nSean Real:\n\nI don’t know. It seemed like it was more than just his musicianship that took him out of road life. It seems like he wasn’t really compensated fairly all the time, and people he was working with, they partied a lot and they were drinking all their money away. So, he was 28 and living with his parents in Kobe, Japan after all that.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow.\n\nSean Real:\n\nAnd so, 1968, karaoke is kind of already a social activity, but it’s done with live instruments. There are bars where you have a musician playing a single guitar or a keyboard or something, and people singing along to the hits.\n\nSean Real:\n\nThis was one of Daisuke’s regular gigs when he was living there with his parents, and he says…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nPlaying the drums?\n\nSean Real:\n\nOh, no, he learned how to play keyboard.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. He says that he taught himself 300 songs, which, once again, is just like, a humble-brag because then, he goes onto say that… “But every time I tried to learn more than 300 songs, I just would forget them, or I would start mixing them up…”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow. So, yeah, Daisuke is pretty down on himself.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nPoor guy. Okay.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. I find it really charming.\n\nSean Real:\n\nSo, he’s working at these karaoke bars, and he’s got a bunch of regular karaoke singers. There was this one businessman who would always sing with him who kind of changed everything. This businessman was about to travel for work, and he wanted to be able to sing for his colleagues on the trip.\n\nSean Real:\n\nAnd Daisuke recalls the businessman saying to him, “Your keyboard-playing is the only music I can sing to. You know how my voice is, and you know what it needs to sound good.” And Daisuke couldn’t take time off work, so he taped himself playing some of this guy’s favorite songs.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nHmm.\n\nSean Real:\n\nAnd it worked! The guy was happy, Daisuke got paid, and… I’m sure you can see where this is going.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nSean Real:\n\nAfter his success with this businessman, Daisuke, in 1971, commissioned a friend to build a machine out of three existing machines: an amplifier, a coin box, and an eight-track car stereo. And he called it the Juke 8.\n\nSean Real:\n\nSo, 100 yen, you’d put in 100 yen, and the machine would turn on for five minutes. You could put on a tape of instrumental music and sing through a microphone, and Roman, I want you to see one of these machines. They’re really beautiful.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSean Real:\n\nIf you just go into Slack…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, wow! It really is beautiful.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIt’s a cabinet, it’s red and white, it has great little analog knobs, and a place for the eight-track cassette, what I would call a cart machine in the radio business that you press in there. And then, a little red cabinet on the right that stores a little library of eight-track tapes. It’s lovely. Is that him smiling right next to it?\n\nSean Real:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, what a delightful looking man!\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. In every picture, he’s smiling like that.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, I love it. The music on these first eight-track tapes, were they the ones that… Did he composed those, or how did he get the music for those?\n\nSean Real:\n\nThey were popular songs, and Daisuke recorded them with his band. Actually, I guess, he recorded his band playing the songs. He says that early on in the process, they fired him from playing.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo, he… again, poor Daisuke!\n\nSean Real:\n\nPoor guy.\n\nSean Real:\n\nSo, he just focused on recording and mixing the music, which is a really important part.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, totally! Totally. Yeah, if it doesn’t get recorded, no karaoke machine.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah! Ugh, yeah, recording and mixing. Thank you, Sharif. Thank you, Roman.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nTotally. Sharif does the really best job with it, for sure.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. And it’s funny to me because, even though Daisuke was fired from his own band, he was a real hustler. He got bars all over Kobe to lease these machines from him. He got contracts with major record labels to use all these popular songs…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow.\n\nSean Real:\n\nBut he didn’t patent the machine…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, no!\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. He says, “When I first made the Juke 8’s, a brother-in-law suggested I take out a patent. But at the time, I didn’t think anything would come of it. I was just hoping the drinking places in the Kobe area would use my machine. Most people don’t believe me when I say this, but I don’t think karaoke would have taken off like it did if there had been a patent on the first machine.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI think that’s actually a pretty fair assessment, honestly.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou know? It’s a really nice and joyful thing. Even though I’ve never participated in it, it’s a nice and joyful thing.\n\nSean Real:\n\nA lot of people think so, yeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd this machine is really, really lovely, and it’s actually nice to think of it as it just existing in the world to make the world better, and not necessarily to make him money.\n\nSean Real:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. It does make some people money. This other person did take out a patent on a laser disc karaoke machine.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh… Oh, God.\n\nSean Real:\n\nBut he’s not part of this story.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nNo. God, no. Let’s write him out of history.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. And then, Daisuke goes on, “Besides, I didn’t build the thing from scratch. The amp, the microphone, the eight-track player, even the 100-yen box machine all had patents on them.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah, but that’s not how patents work. He could have totally gotten a patent for it.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYou think so?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nTotally.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah, I don’t know anything about patent law, especially Japanese patent law.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWell, I don’t know about Japanese patent law, and I actually am no expert of US patent law, but if you come up with a new use for even a known thing, and prescribed that use inside of the patent… It doesn’t have to be three machines. It could be one machine to do a certain thing, as long as you change a little bit something and change its purpose. So, he totally had the right to a patent, for sure.\n\nSean Real:\n\nSo, this is just more of him talking smack on himself!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah.\n\nSean Real:\n\nBut yeah, what I really love about this story on a whole is that he seems pretty okay with how all of this turned out.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nGood.\n\nSean Real:\n\nHe talks a lot about how glad he is that this brought so much joy into the world.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah.\n\nSean Real:\n\nAnd he says, “I may not have the original patent. Some say I would have made 80 million dollars last year, and that was a bad year. But I have good friends and a family I love, and I can’t help but smile every day.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAw. Do you have a thing to sum up, or is that it?\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah, I guess the last thing was. I just wanted to say that Daisuke says that to honor karaoke, he and his wife and daughter and three granddaughters get out a songbook once a week and see who can sing the most songs before going hoarse. Which sounds crazy.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat is so crazy!\n\nSean Real:\n\nThat’s way harder than I want to party. And, yeah. There’s more to his story, but I think it’s better told from him, so we’ll put a link to that on our website.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nNice. All right, thanks.\n\nSean Real:\n\nYeah. And we should totally go karaoke-ing some time.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, totally. I think we could make that happen. Thanks.\n\nSean Real:\n\nThanks, Roman.\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAbout a year ago, our senior editor, Delaney Hall, moved from beautiful downtown Oakland, California back to New Mexico, where she grew up. She now works for 99pi remotely, and her mini-story is about this phenomenon in the new city where she lives, which is Santa Fe.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThe phenomenon is called Zozobra.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nZozobra is a big deal here in Santa Fe. Basically, every year, a group of people in the city build this enormous marionette that’s named Zozobra. And in Spanish, “zozobra” means anxiety. So, he’s all of the city’s collective sorrows embodied in this huge puppet.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow! That’s amazing. So, what does he look like?\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nWell, he’s 50 feet tall. He is dressed in a long, white gown. He has these very dark, angry eyes, they’re usually rimmed with green or black. And what happens is that every fall, this group constructs a new Zozobra and about 50,000 people gather in one of Santa Fe’s biggest parks, and they burn him.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow! They burn him! A 50-foot puppet!\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah. Yeah, it’s a very intense kind of Pagan-feeling event. I mean, basically, the crowd chants, “Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!” And he’s set on fire, and he is slowly engulfed in flames.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd I assume they burn him so that they can burn their collective anxiety that he represents.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah, yeah, exactly! Because he represents gloom, it’s this way that the city purges its sadness every year. And people get to participate in these interesting ways, and one of the reasons Zozobra is so flammable is that he is stuffed with bushels of shredded paper. And where that paper comes from is in the weeks leading up to the burning, anyone with an excess of gloom is encouraged to sort of write down their gloomy thoughts on a piece of paper, and to leave it in this thing called The Gloom Box. Which, at least in the past, has been located in the offices of one of the local newspapers.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nSo, people contribute police reports and mortgage documents and divorce papers. I mean, just anything they might want to burn.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIt reminds me of other sort of bonfire rituals, like Burning Man or something, which a lot of people go to around here.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah. I mean, Zozobra’s been around a lot longer than Burning Man. It’s been around since the 1920’s. But there are definitely some similarities. Both were developed by artists. Both events began relatively small, like in someone’s backyard or on a beach, and then grew into something much bigger. And both actually draw on other traditions that go back even farther.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nBut one thing that’s pretty neat about Zozobra is that because he’s a puppet, he’s capable of kind of rudimentary movement, so his arms swing around, his jaw is hinged, his mouth opens and closes. And he also makes sound. So, I’m going to play a little bit of sound of the event so you can hear it.\n\nZozobra:\n\n(groaning sounds)\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd I assume he’s flailing at the same time.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah! He’s flailing, his mouth is opening and closing… It’s actually a really troubling event to go to as a kid. It’s sort of seared into my memory. But this is actually the thing I most want to tell you about, because I recently learned, just in the past year or so, that the voice of Zozobra is performed live, and there is one guy who’s been doing the voice for about 20 years. And I learned this thanks to this gem of local reporting from KOET Action 7 News.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nMe, I see him as an old, grumpy old man. And that’s the character that I get into.\n\nNews Reporter:\n\nThis is the Zozobra you know.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nThey want to get rid of him. They want to destroy him. They want to burn him, and the way I play the character is, I’m fighting to stay alive.\n\nZozobra:\n\n(roaring & groaning)\n\nNews Reporter:\n\nOn Friday, Michael Ellis will take on the persona of our collective sorrow for the 19th time. And despite the title of Old Man Gloom, Zozobra’s voice battles several emotions.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nThere are times when he’ll sound like he’s crying.\n\nZozobra:\n\n(moaning)\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nProtesting.\n\nZozobra:\n\n(roaring)\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nAdamant! “I’m not going to let you do this to me again!”\n\nZozobra:\n\n(groaning)\n\nNews Reporter:\n\nEllis says the audience of 50,000 should always know what Zozobra is feeling.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nNot only do I want the crowd to hear him, I want them to feel it.\n\nNews Reporter:\n\nAnd even after 19 years, for Ellis, the big night is always exciting.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nI’ll sit down and have a sandwich in the early afternoon. After that, I’ve got butterflies, and I won’t have anything until after it’s all over.\n\nNews Reporter:\n\nOn Friday night, those butterflies join all of New Mexico’s gloom up in smoke.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah, I just, I love this news clip so much. I think it’s one of my favorites ever, and it’s the combination of the reporter’s seriousness or maybe mock-seriousness, and then just the sublime ridiculousness of what you’re seeing. Which, of course, people can’t see it, but to describe it. It’s Michael Ellis, the voice of Zozobra, performing the sounds of Zozobra but to this big, empty baseball field.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nWhich, you know, probably later in the night will be filled with 50,000, 60,000 screaming people, but at the moment, is just entirely empty. Yeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, that’s so good. So, you get a little taste of what Michael Ellis is about, but what is he really like?\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYeah. This was the only thing I could find on the internet about him. And from seeing this clip, I definitely wanted to learn more, so I looked him up and went to talk with him. And what I learned is that he was born and raised in Santa Fe, and… So Michael told me that as a kid, Zozobra was this figure, this monster, who almost seemed real, like, actually alive. And that sense of realness was this thing that the community continues to really play into and cultivate.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nGrowing up, I remember there would be little stories in the newspaper talking about how Zozobra’s been spotted in the arroyos in the east side of town, and you would hear stories of sheep being missing from the area. Little things like that that play into trying to make this thing seem real.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd so, from there, how did Michael actually become the voice of Zozobra?\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nAs a high schooler, he started volunteering for the event. He would help with building the puppet, stuff like that, and he just kept being involved a little more each year. And eventually, he was asked if he wanted to help with the voice. It was just sort of a matter of hanging around for long enough, I guess.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nDid Michael do it any differently? Did he add something special to the voice when he took over?\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nMichael didn’t have any formal voice acting experience. He’s done various jobs throughout his life, including working at Lowe’s Hardware, and running a DJ business. But he told me that the main thing he wanted to bring to Zozobra was that sense of realness, the kind of aliveness that I was talking about earlier. And to do that, he said he had to find ways to really empathize with Zozobra – this grumpy old man – and to see the whole event unfolding from his perspective.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nKnowing that everybody wants his demise, they want to see it happen, so I do my best to try to fight, with just, you know, with my voice. And there are times when it’ll almost sound like he’s crying.\n\nZozobra:\n\n(crying)\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nWhen he begins to realize that there isn’t anything he’s going to be able to do to stop it.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nOf course, in our conversation, I was pushing to try to understand, is there some deep, gloomy memory or experience that Michael taps into in order to perform? I asked him about his personal history. I asked him about some health problems he’s had recently. But he said, you know, not really.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nIt just comes when it’s needed.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nYou’ve just got the readily accessible grumpy old man, right there.\n\nMichael Ellis:\n\nI guess. Maybe there’s a little bit of that deep inside.\n\nDelaney Hall:\n\nThat’s the voice of Zozobra, and I really like thinking about the fact that, when I went to see Zozobra burn back in the ’80s, it was Michael performing the voice. And if I take Fiona, my daughter, next year, that it will probably be Michael again.\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nUp next is our technical producer, Sharif Youssef.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nDo we just go?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWe’re rolling, so…\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nOkay!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWhatever you want to do.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAll right. Roman, if I told you that I had another map story, how excited would you be?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nVery excited!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nOkay, cool.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI love a good map story.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nOh, I know. Maybe if you could just go to Google Maps real quick. The main thing we’re going to be looking at today is the border between the U.S. and Canada. And pardon my sibilants, I have some dental work.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou’re excused.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nThank you. And the thing that you need to pay attention to is the 49th parallel in the Pacific Northwest of America.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOkay.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nImportant thing that-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou mean here?\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nOkay, yeah. And you can probably, maybe now, can notice a little something that looks off.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAre you talking about Point Roberts? That sticks out right here.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYes.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nPoint Roberts, on that little peninsula.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nTsawwassen Peninsula. Maybe you can just sort of describe what you’re seeing there.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo, Point Roberts is off a peninsula off of the area of Vancouver. It looks like it is completely cut off from the U.S., except by water. By land, you’d have to get to it through Canada. It’s got a few… some very, very gridded streets.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. A couple.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nJust a couple! Yeah. It’s kind of like an exclave, but not quite.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. It’s a semi-exclasive space, but it is difficult to get into, so it’s an exclusive exclasive thing. So yeah, Point Roberts is actually in Washington State, part of Watkin County. I first heard about Point Roberts from a podcast called “Stop Podcasting Yourself”, hosted by Dave Shumka and Graham Clark – two Vancouverites – and they are saying that some Vancouverites go there, because it’s only 20 miles away or so, in order to pick up packages because shipping across the border is actually quite expensive. And also, to get cheaper gas.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nIt’s also rumored to be the site of a federal witness protection program. Like, where they relocate.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, wow.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd I just happened to be in Seattle a little bit ago, and I also wanted an excuse to go to Vancouver and have you pay for it, so I decided to go… Shall I just play some border crossing, my first border crossing?\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAll right! This is Peace Arch border from-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWashington State into Canada.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nExactly.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Hi.”\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“How’re you doing?”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Good, how are you?”\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“Good, thanks. What’s the purpose of your visit?”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“I’m going to Point Roberts to report a story. That was just a weird little part of America that you have to go through, two border crossings to get to.”\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“Yeah, yeah, it’s unbelievable.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Exactly.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou sound very nervous.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah, could you hear my voice crack a little? Yeah. I think there’s an instinct that arises in every Arab when they are crossing a border.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAlso, funny story, the last time I crossed a Canadian border, I was three or four years old going into the American side of Niagara Falls, and the border guard looked in, was like, “Is everyone in this car American?”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd my dad’s like, “I’m Egyptian, she’s American, and he’s American in the back.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd I go, “No! I’m French! I’m being kidnapped!”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, my God!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nSo, there’s some trauma around the Canadian borders.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, young Sharif!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nI was a little…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou were a scamp!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYep! Scamp is a much nicer word than I was going to use.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nOkay.\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“Are you making any stops in between?”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Not in between, but I’m spending the night in Vancouver tonight.”\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“Okay. You’re good. Have a good time.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Thanks, man!”\n\nBorder Agent:\n\n“Bye.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nUnscathed.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nUnscathed! Yeah, he was a very nice border-crossing guard. He did ask if I had been arrested, which apparently is a thing. If you’ve been arrested, you have to get special permission to get into Canada if you have a criminal record in the States.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nSo, anyway, it’s another 20 or 30-minute drive to Border Number Two…\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Welcome to Little America. I just crossed the border into Point Roberts. Scenic Loop Gateway. That sounds like something I would do! I like scenics, loops.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd basically, immediately, to my right, after I crossed the border, there’s a place that receives packages. Open 24/7, automated retrieval, vacuum-brewed coffee, parcel services. It seems like there are a lot of places for parcel service…\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd that was the theme throughout the entire time in Point Roberts. Basically, any shop, no matter what it was selling or what it did, they offered to accept packages for you.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Uh! It’s good to be back to the familiar land of America. God. The gas is in gallons? Oh, maybe it’s not! Oh, interesting! You measure the gas in liters here, even in America. That’s nuts!”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow! Liters!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah, liters!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo, what else did you find, these little differences besides the liters revelation?\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. There wasn’t much. It wasn’t the most happening spot.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Free wood.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nIt’s about five square miles, a population of 1,314 according to the latest U.S. Census in 2010. But in the summertime, it can grow to about three or four times that because a lot of Canadian vacationers come in.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nHm.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nI went to the post office.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Oh. It’s closed because it’s Saturday. 1:15.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIs there a school system, or…\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nI saw that there is one primary school. I believe it goes up to grade three or four. And then, everyone who is older than that has to go across four international borders every school day to go to school in Blaine, Washington.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, my God.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. And I grew up in a fairly rural place with long school bus rides, so I very much empathize and feel for you, any Point Roberts school kids who are listening.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Driving down this main drag. The biggest little store in Point Roberts. Hey.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nEventually, I ran into their restaurant district.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Aw, sh*t! It’s called The Reef Tavern? I have to eat there, right?”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nReef Tavern is calling to you! That’s what we call you, I don’t know if people know that.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. It was fate. And at The Reef Tavern, I had a wonderful server named Tony, and he was just the absolute sweetest person, and told me about how people from Canada go to that restaurant to get medium rare burgers, because apparently, the health codes in Canada are a little more strict about how… what’s the, I’m bad at meat terms…\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nBasically, in Canada, you have to cook it longer, so the real blood connoisseurs go to Point Roberts.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“I’m a journalist from Oakland, California.”\n\nTony:\n\n“Huh! I used to live on the East Bay!”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Oh, yeah?”\n\nTony:\n\n“Yeah, I used to live right out-”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Whereabouts?”\n\nTony:\n\n“Right around Lake Merritt.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, that’s so cool that you ran into the other Oakland guy.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah! What are the odds?\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nAnd that’s not even the weirdest part. Hold on, let me play you a little something. Get ready to have your mind blown, Roman.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nI’m prepared.\n\nRestaurant Patron:\n\n“Welcome to Point Roberts, then.”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Yeah, thank you.”\n\nRestaurant Patron:\n\n“We’re from downtown Point Roberts right here.”\n\nTony:\n\n“Beautiful downtown!”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nBeautiful Downtown Point Roberts! (Chuckles)\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. You guys have the same catchphrase.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\n(Laughs) Oh, my God.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat’s amazing.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah, I don’t understand how the stars of the universe aligned in such a way, but…\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYou were just supposed to go there.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nI know!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nIt sounds like a lovely trip.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nDid you ever figure out why the gas was in liters?\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nI didn’t do much sleuthing, but my guess is, mainly to market to Canadians.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight, so they know how much gas they’re putting in their cars.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. Exactly. And actually, at The Reef Tavern, I saw two very lovely Canadians named Jason and Lisa. They had come in that very day to pick up a guitar loop pedal from a seller on eBay who didn’t want to ship it across the border.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, perfect.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. Here.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo, it’s super common, common enough-\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat you would just run across a person who is doing the type of thing that you’re expecting.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nTotally, totally.\n\nJason:\n\nL”ooking into the town, Lisa saw that the average visitor spends less than 20 minutes. Only five percent of the visitors spend longer than an hour.”\n\nLisa:\n\n“…Stay longer than an hour, yeah. Anyway, we’ve never been here before and it’s super weird. ”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“Cool! Thank you guys so much.”\n\nLisa:\n\n“Yeah!”\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\n“I’ll give you guys my phone number, in case you guys are…”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nMaking friends!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. Making friends. And coincidentally, I showed them where I was staying in Vancouver, and it was basically right next to them. And they invited me to drink wine and decorate their Christmas tree, and it was just a really lovely evening.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow, that’s so cool!\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nDid you ever get confirmation about the witness protection thing?\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nHmm. Well, I guess I can neither confirm nor deny it. I actually reached out to Gerald Shore, the founder of the Witness Protection Program, and he responded back and he says, “I have no information on Point Roberts, Washington.” Which I guess you can take to be anything you want!\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nOh, that’s awesome. Nice adventure, in the name of the show.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah! Thanks for the expense.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nNo problem! Thanks, Sharif.\n\nSharif Youssef:\n\nYeah. Thanks.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSpecial thanks to Nate Berg, Lawrence Bohr, and Pete Early for helping Sharif out with that story. We have one more mini-story coming up next with the King of the Coda, Kurt Kohlstedt, after this.\n\n[BREAK]\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo every year at the end of the year and the beginning of the next year we do these many stories. And the funny thing is is that the many stories were so popular that we began doing them curtain time in the studio with dirt curtain I started doing kind of a mini-stories almost every episode as like the coda because there’s always some story that Kurt has that relates to the story we just told. But this one we never found a place for it.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah this one just never quite fit yet. And I really wanted to tell it, you know.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThen we have the perfect opportunity.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah. So basically last year the Ford Motor Company made big news in Detroit and they said they were going to buy and renovate Michigan Central Station.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd this is like a big train station sort of the Grand Central Terminal type train station.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah. It’s huge old beautiful. It’s like Grand Central but much much taller and it’s in downtown Detroit. Yeah it’s really visible when you’re coming in on the highway. It’s like one of the most visible, tallest structures on the side of the city.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd so Ford, based still in Detroit, bought this and they’re going to renovate it.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nAnd suddenly there is all this news around the fact that they’re going to come out and do this big press conference and explain to the city what their plan was for this old building that had been deserted for so long. And in the lead up to that big press conference someone anonymously approached the Ford Museum with this surprising artifact. It was this big round antique clock that used to hang really prominently on one of the walls of the station.\n\nArchive Tape:\n\n“Let’s face it. Train passengers needed to know the time. So the clock is huge. It’s been gone for a very long time now and Bill Ford says he couldn’t believe it when a secret approach was made to get that clock back. Somebody must have really loved it and loved the train station because they took very good care of it.”\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo somebody stole this gigantic clock from a train station and then they returned it when they heard that the Train Station is gonna be renovated.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah it’s pretty remarkable. And we don’t really know much about the person who returned the clock. I mean maybe they just took it to try to help preserve it. Maybe they weren’t even the original thief. It’s possible they bought it or found it.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nEbay.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah. Or inherited it. All we really know for sure is that they carefully wrapped it up and then told the folks at the Ford Museum where to find it.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWhat do you mean where to find it? Like they left it somewhere…\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah, they left it like alongside of the side of a building. There are pictures of this. You can see it like they just kind of wrapped it up and like kind of strapped it in.\n\nRoman Mars: And then hightailed it.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nAnd then hightailed it. And just texted them.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat’s amazing.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nJust come and grab the clock but bring a couple guys and a truck.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow. It’s amazing that he felt so inspired to give it back.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nI mean, I think this is sort of a civic icon. It’s this stunning massive Beaux Arts structure and it was designed by the same architects as Grand Central Terminal in New York. And the idea originally was that it would be the Grand Central of the Midwest. It would handle all this passenger and free traffic and be kind of, you know, this landmark in the city. So they put up these, you know, it’s filled with all these beautiful details – these marble walls, vaulted ceilings, copper skylights – and it’s huge. It’s 18 stories tall. So there are restaurants and shops down below and then office spaces above.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nAnd so, but obviously it fell on hard times. So what went wrong with the Michigan Central Station.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nWell a lot of things arguably but the rise of the car definitely helped drive it out of business. You know more people were driving out to the suburbs and the city itself and the station founded disuse. And at first the officers cleared out and then the shops and restaurants started to close down. And then finally in the 80s the ticket booth shut down. And basically the whole place was just locked up.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWell they just abandoned it. It was left empty at that point.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah. And there was talk over the years of, you know, tearing it down but it had this status as a landmark and that helped protect it from demolition.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYou know, they came up with plans to try to re-use this, like ideas to turn into a police station or convention center or even a casino. And none of those panned out. So the building just kind of kept being sold and changing hands and the owners before Ford finally did do some work kind of like they drained the basement and they had some new windows and they put up a security fence.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nObviously that must have happened after the clock was stolen.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah, yeah, they definitely were aware that things were disappearing from the building. And I think they wanted to put a stop to that. I mean, a lot of people were visiting this building to take pictures or, you know, just explore it. But along the way hundreds of artifacts were taken too.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nSo the clock is really just one piece of the puzzle. There were lots of little things taken from this building I would imagine over the years.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nYeah, a really large piece they took multiple people to move but definitely one of many things. And returning it actually started this kind of bigger movement because once Ford had the clock in hand, they were able to put out a call and say “Hey, look smene returned this clock. If anybody else has stuff maybe you could bring it back too and, you know, you won’t get in trouble, no questions asked.’\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nLeave it on the side of the building.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nRight. Right. And it worked. Dozens of people have now come forward to offer up old station artifacts including fountains and plaster medallions and light fixtures and all kinds of stuff.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWow. Wow.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah. And Ford actually has a wishlist too. They want back things like the ticket window grills elevator transit panels, other clocks that have disappeared over the years and basically, you know, anything that is sort of considered critical to the historic character of the building.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nRight. And what are they… are they planning to restore it as it was? What are they planned to do with all these artifacts.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nWell some things will probably go back into the building and others will end up in local museums. And one of the sort of side benefits is that some of these things can be used to model copies too, right? So if you have one plaster medallion you can make a bunch of other ones in the renovated building.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nWell that makes sense. So is the idea that this thing is gonna be like a passenger train terminal again or is it something different.\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nNo, it’s gonna be something different. Basically, Ford hired Snohetta, this sort of famous international design firm, to help them build out a new campus. They’re calling it the Corktown campus. It’s going to be the center for Ford to develop, you know, autonomous vehicles and other urban road-related technologies in a nice, central area where they can do like actual on the road testing and the station itself is going to be at the heart of this and it’s gonna be repopulated actually with a lot of the same things they had before like restaurants and shops. And above there are going to be offices but also condos now. And the idea is that Ford can, you know, move some of its people and its partner organizations up into these spaces.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nHave you seen pictures of the artifacts and the renovation at all?\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nYeah, there’s some great images of the clock and it’s sitting outside wrapped up. And there are a lot of historic photos that kind of show what was there what’s missing and, you know, Ford’s plan for what this building is going to look like when they’re all done with this campus.\n\nRoman Mars:\n\nThat’s awesome. Can you put them on the website for us?\n\nKurt Kohlstedt:\n\nOh yeah of course."
