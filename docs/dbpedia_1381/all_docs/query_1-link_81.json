        "text": "Summer Streets is the epic Manhattan tradition that opens up miles of thoroughfares for walkers, runners, bicyclists and people-watchers of all ages.\n\nThis event takes place in Manhattan on August 3, 10 and 17; and Brooklyn and The Bronx on August 24. It’s free for all to walk, run, play and bike throughout the Summer Street closures, and there are typically themed rest stops with food and entertainment along the route.\n\nHere's the breakdown of where you can find Summer Streets throughout NYC this summer.\n\nThe U.S. Open—New York’s exhilarating summer sports event—is one of the most exciting things to do in Queens. It returns this month with plenty of exciting activities for fans. The U.S. Open's main draw will begin on August 26 and run through until September 8.\n\nThere are around 40 tournament sessions to pick from, and either day or evening passes. The seats range from reserved stadium seating to general admission ground passes or even luxury suits. All tickets are available to purchase on Ticketnetwork, USOpen.org and Ticketmaster.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAlthough folks from around the world know all about the U.S. Open, not many are aware of the fact that the event's fan week, which usually takes place a few days before the tournament's official kickoff, actually offers a wider (and cheaper!) roster of things to do related to the competition.\n\nThis year, US Open Fan Week runs from August 19 through 25, offering everyone free grounds admission ahead of the August 26 main draw. You can browse through the full list of events right here, including tournaments, parties and more.\n\nAfropunk Festival, a celebration of alternative Black music and artistry, has become one of the most exciting live events in the world. Not everyone knows that the party, which is now global, actually started in Brooklyn, and it's officially coming back for two days next month.\n\nThis year's festival, AFROPUNK BLKTOPIA BKLYN, will take place from August 23-24 at the Lena Horne Bandshell in Prospect Park. Although the full lineup hasn't been announced yet, the festival will be headlined by the legendary Erykah Badu for the first time since 2018. Tickets are on sale here.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe views at Edge, the highest sky deck in the western hemisphere, are always stunning, but now they’re even more beautiful thanks to an eye-catching new activation.\n\nThis highly Instagrammable exhibit called “SHADES” features transparent colors in both the indoor and outdoor areas of Edge. On the outdoor deck, see how the perspective changes as you look through the clear glass versus the colorful panels. Inside, peek through colorful panels that make an adorable photo-op. “SHADES” is on view through September and is included with admission.\n\nEven for longtime New Yorkers who have seen the skyline thousands of times, the experience offers a fresh perspective on the city.\n\nNew York City Restaurant Week’s summer edition is upon us. Reservations for the summer session are available at more than 600 restaurants with prix fixe specials citywide through August 18. This year’s price points are $30, $45 and $60 for brunch, lunch and dinner menus on the days of each venue’s choosing.\n\nWith so many sensational spots, and so little time to taste them all, it can be hard to narrow the field. Luckily, we've taken the initiative to highlight the top options.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe city’s most beloved free summer concert series is back with a stellar line-up featuring nearly 85 free and benefit shows in Central Park, plus neighborhood parks across the five boroughs.\n\nThe 2024 SummerStage lineup includes T-Pain, Snail Mail, Madison Cunningham, Corinne Bailey Rae, The Metropolitan Opera, Counting Crows, Ghostface Killah, The Gaslight Anthem, Trixie Mattel and Amanda Lepore, and more.\n\nThis season is all about celebrating incredible music from around the world with artists like The Aussie BBQ, Colombian music star Fonseca and Spain’s captivating new flamenco singer Israel Fernández, Sidonie and the Balkan Paradise Orchestra.\n\nAll shows are free except the benefit concerts. Here's the full schedule and ticket info.\n\nSmorgasburg, the food bazaar spectacular, is back for 2024 with dozens of great local vendors across four locations.\n\nIn fact, with more than 70 vendors, it's the largest Smorgasburg lineup since 2018! Vendors this year will serve up fragrant Ethiopian stews, Hawaii-style street comforts, explosive pani puri, potato puff poutine, and lots more.\n\nSmorgasburg WTC runs on Fridays; Williamsburg is on Saturdays; and Prospect Park is on Sundays. Each location is open from 11am-6pm and operates weekly through October. The outlier is The Shed location; it'll run from July 3-August 22 from 11am-6pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNew York summers wouldn't feel the same without the iconic MoMA PS1 music series, which every year highlights some of the most relevant DJs of the moment. MoMA PS1's Warm Up series is about to back for its 26th season in Long Island City.\n\nFor six Fridays in July and August, the museum's outdoor space turns into a giant day party from 4pm-10pm. The lineup includes Hyperdub label founder Kode9, Jersey club pioneer UNIIQU3, Juliana Huxtable and other underground club culture icons from cities like São Paulo, Paris, and beyond.\n\nEat your way through Japan without ever leaving New York City at JAPAN Fes, the massive foodie festival, which is back and bigger than ever for 2024. The organization is hosting 30 outdoor events this year stretching through November in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Event organizers say it's the largest Japanese food festival in the world, attracting 300,000 visitors and featuring 1,000 vendors every year.\n\nExpect dishes including takoyaki, ramen, matcha sweets, yakisoba, karaage, okonomiyaki, and lots more. They're even hosting a ramen contest and a konamon contest this year to crown the best of the bunch. Vendors hail from New York City, as well as other states and other countries.\n\nHere's the full list of dates and neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn the resonant words of A$AP Rocky, \"The nails, the kilts, the pretty-boy swag, the pearls—I think it's just being comfortable. I just express myself with fashion, and what's fly is fly.\" What's fly is \"Ice Cold: An Exhibition of Hip-Hop Jewelry\" at the American Museum of Natural History, a new show that features dozens of incredible necklaces, rings, watches, chains, and more worn by some of the biggest names in music.\n\nA few highlights include T-Pain's Big Ass Chain necklace, Ghostface Killah's eagle arm band, Nicki Minaj's Barbie pendant, Beyoncé's nail rings, Cardi B's nipple covers, and Slick Rick's crown. While the pieces are a sight to behold up-close, the exhibit carries a much deeper meaning, especially as New York City wraps up its 50 years of hip-hop celebrations.\n\nSometimes you’ll feel very tall, sometimes very small, and sometimes in awe of it all at this new New York Botanical Garden exhibit that celebrates the magic of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. With a variety of botanical and artistic exhibitions throughout the Bronx garden’s 250 acres, “Wonderland: Curious Nature” encourages visitors to get “curiouser and curiouser” around every turn.\n\nSee a massive white (well, actually green) rabbit made entirely of plants; explore an enchanting English garden with delightfully weird flora; climb through a rabbit hole; hang out in a house made of mycelium bricks; and much more at this sprawling exhibition. Wonderland: Curious Nature runs through to October 27, 2024, and will evolve with each season.\n\nThough it's now more than 150 years since the first publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the delightful story with its heroic protagonist feels just as fresh as ever—especially at New York Botanical Garden with its enchanting scientific and artistic twist on the story.\n\nAdvertising\n\nA bevy open-air night markets are popping up around town this summer, from the Bronx to Brooklyn and Manhattan to Queens. Plus, the Vegan Night Market and Latin Night Market are back! This summer also sees the first Union Square Night Market and the first Lincoln Center Night Market.\n\nWe've rounded up details on all of them, so grab some cash and make plans to eat locally—and deliciously.\n\nOcean noise, chemical pollution, climate change and sea level rise are words that often appear in the news. But these important concepts can be hard to make sense of—or to understand at all.\n\nThat's where artist Jenny Kendler comes in. Her new exhibit, Other of Pearl, confronts these pressing environmental issues in ways that feel more accessible with stirring whale songs, incredible pearl sculptures, a crystalline whale eye cast with human tears, and more. You can see these powerful works for free on Wednesdays-Sundays from 10am-5pm now through October on Governors Island.\n\nSeven intimate, delicate works are displayed in the cavernous, subterranean magazine of historic Fort Jay, a star-shaped fortification built on Governors Island between 1775 and 1776.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTSQ Live offers a series of 80 free, open-air performances all over Times Square. It's basically a giant, free outdoor event festival with programs presented by the likes of Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Soul Summit and more.\n\nExpect dance workshops by Ailey Extension, weekly DJ sets, and a new series called Street Lab that will feature pop-up activations for entire families focusing on all things art. This year's full lineup can be found right here.\n\nBasically a massive maze made of ropes, this new exhibit allows attendees to jump inside, climb, relax and even get lost in the whole webbed arrangement that’s comprised of 80,000 feet of handwoven rope, which is part of a 400-square-foot interactive artwork created by Treenet Collective, a net expert company.\n\nFind \"The INTERnet\" at INTER_, the interactive art center at 415 Broadway by Canal Street in Soho.\n\nThe installation, which accommodates 15 people at once, boasts a variety of different weaving styles, each one creating a \"setting\" for folks to dive into, including the \"quantum leap,\" where guests can play in mid-air, and the \"social network,\" a more serene space that will feel like you are floating above everyone else.\n\nAdvertising\n\nYou might not know who Cellino and Barnes are, but you can definitely recite their law firm's phone number by heart.\n\nRoss Cellino Jr. and Steve Barnes founded their personal injury law firm in Buffalo, New York back in 1998. The pair quickly rose to prominence after their distinctive jingle—\"Cellino and Barnes, injury attorneys, call 1-800-888-8888\"—basically turned them into Internet celebrities.\n\nThat history, including what led to the dissolution of the company, is the subject of the Off Broadway dark comedy Cellino V. Barnes, at Asylum NYC (123 East 24th Street by Lexington Avenue) through October 13. Tickets for Cellino V. Barnes are available here.\n\nThere's nothing more \"summer in NYC\" than taking in a movie in the great outdoors, under the hardly-seen stars and set to the humming soundtrack of the city.\n\nNew Yorkers love to take in films on the nicest rooftops, on the best beaches, and in our city's greatest parks (preferably with a drink or popcorn in hand). Luckily, NYC has no shortage of places to catch outdoor movie screenings you can attend in the warmer months.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Brooklyn Flea is undoubtedly one of the most popular flea markets to hit in NYC if you're looking for the best selection of throwback wares and records.\n\nThe Brooklyn Flea DUMBO is now underway on the cobblestone streets of Pearl Plaza, where it spotlights roughly more than 40 vendors that display their goods beneath the Manhattan Bridge. Brooklyn Flea also operates in Chelsea year-round on Saturdays and Sundays, 8am-4pm.\n\nDon’t bother with Orlando. Coney Island is its very own magical kingdom, setting off free, sensational fireworks every Friday night all summer long. Grab a frank and get yourself a comfortable spot on the boardwalk to celebrate the end of the work-week every week.\n\nFriday Night Fireworks run through Labor Day. Fireworks begin at approximately 9:45pm and launch from the beach at West 12th Street, providing a breathtaking backdrop to the iconic boardwalk and amusement parks.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Rooftop at Pier 17 has long been one of our favorite concert venues in New York City. The panoramic views, the chill vibe, and the stellar acoustics make it a truly special spot to see a show. And with this year's stacked lineup of 60+ concerts this summer, it's definitely worth heading there for a night of live music.\n\nThe sixth Summer Concert Series on The Rooftop at Pier 17 features more than 60 artists in genres from rap to rock to electronic and more. Plus, there are several bands on the roster that will make Millennials swoon with nostalgia. Read on for the full lineup and get tickets here.\n\nMake like Ken and get to the beach. New York City beaches are now open for swimming and sunbathing. From the popular Jacob Riis Park Beach to The Bronx’s only public beach, we've got a detailed round-up of where to soak up the sun this summer.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAny New Yorker who has melted their brain by watching daylong marathons of The Real Housewives, Below Deck and Vanderpump Rules (guilty!) has been waiting for this day: New York is finally getting a Bravo-inspired bar.\n\nFrom Friday, August 2 to Sunday, October 6 at Selene (11 Hanover Square), you can sip on a Mazel Mule, a Physically Shaking Margarita or a Pumptini—that Vanderpump classic—while you recreate memorable Bravo moments in photo opps, show off your Bravo knowledge in trivia games and peruse a historical archive of real-deal Bravo artifacts.\n\nGeneral admission ticket starts at $35 and includes a glass of rosé and 90 minutes to experience the Diamonds and Rosé pop-up.\n\nLife in Midtown Manhattan will get a little sweeter as of August 6 when the first-ever Ghirardelli Chocolate & Ice Cream Shop in New York makes its decadent debut at the Empire State Building. This beloved brand currently operates 16 sweets shops across the nation, mostly in California, and this store will be its northeast debut.\n\nExpect the Empire State Building shop to become a go-to spot for milkshakes, brownies, chocolate-covered strawberries, hot fudge sundaes, and, of course, those classic foil-wrapped chocolate squares.\n\nFind NYC's Ghirardelli Chocolate & Ice Cream Shop on the ground floor of the Empire State Building (20 West 34th Street). The store will be open from 9am-11pm Sunday-Thursday and 9am-midnight on Friday and Saturday.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Jazz Age Lawn Party is one of the most spectacular things to do this summer on gorgeous Governors Island. Step onto the ferry—and back in time—with thousands of revelers dressed to the 1920s-nines. During the event, enjoy live music from Michael Arenella and his Dreamland Orchestra, learn the Charleston, sip cocktails and have a picnic in the sunshine.\n\nThe Jazz Age Lawn Party takes place on August 10 and 11, 2024. General admission costs $50/person. You can purchase tickets here.\n\nThink you can't afford the finer things? Think again.

But a grove of live citrus trees growing inside a Meatpacking District museum is even more surprising.\n\nAstonishingly, 18 citrus trees are now in bloom inside the Whitney Museum of American Art, and you can walk through the grove on the museum’s eighth floor through January 1, 2025. The exhibition, “Survival Piece #5: Portable Orchard,” was conceived in 1972 by Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison. This groundbreaking eco-art project is on view at a museum for the first time since its debut more than 50 years ago.\n\nOver the course of the exhibition, the living sculptures will change and grow harvestable fruit that will be used in public programs.\n\nFor far too long people have looked down upon the unicycle, ridiculing riders for how silly they look perched up high above a single wheel. It’s time that one-wheel lovers unite and take over the streets of New York! That’s just what the NYC Unicycle Festival is planning to do over Labor Day weekend.\n\nTo kick things off on Thursday, August 29, unicyclists will meet up in Battery Park and cruise to Central Park with a stop in Times Square. The next day, on Friday, August 30, Brooklyn Unicycle Day features a massive group ride over the Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island—more than 13 miles on one wheel.\n\nAs for Saturday, August 31, the festival’s main event will be held at Hudson River Park's Pier 76 in Manhattan. Activities include a learn-to-ride area, basketball competition games, demonstrations, and more.

All ages are welcome to attend. Here's the full schedule.\n\nAdvertising\n\nGrab the fam and head to Historic Richmond Town, a preserved museum village dating from the late 17th century, for its annual county fair.

Plus, come hungry for fair fare like empanadas, lobster rolls, rice balls, funnel cakes and zeppoles.\n\nAll the fun's for a good cause, as proceeds support Historic Richmond Town in its mission to preserve and share local history.\n\nIt might seem impossible to experience tranquility in the middle of hustling, bustling Manhattan, but Bryant Park’s free yoga series presented by CALIA is aiming to achieve just that.

These popular classes occur Tuesday mornings at 10am on the terrace and Wednesday afternoons at 6pm on the lawn.\n\nThough the classes are free and open to the public, make sure to register in advance, and don't forget your yoga mat and water bottle!\n\nAdvertising\n\nFrom old New York throwbacks to party destinations and seaside terraces practically fashioned for Instagram, these rooftop bars offer booze, some kind of view and an invitation for you to get high."
