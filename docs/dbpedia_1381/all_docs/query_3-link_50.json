        "text": "The Willamette River Basin in western Oregon spans nearly 12,000 square miles (30,000 square kilometers), from its snowy, forested headwaters in the Oregon Cascades to its green valley floor. It is home to 70% of Oregon’s population, and provides water for the region's diverse ecosystems and economy. Currently, the Willamette River Basin is water-rich, but with a warming climate and increasing socio-economic pressures that may not always be the case. Such pressures raise a number of important questions:\n\nWill we have enough water to satisfy future needs?\n\nWhere, when and under what conditions might water scarcity emerge in the coming decades?\n\nWhat policy actions might reduce the potential for water scarcity?\n\nThese questions motivated the Willamette Water 2100 project (WW2100), a collaborative research project led by faculty from Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Oregon (UO), Portland State University (PSU) and the University of California-Santa Barbara. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and ran from October 2010 through September 2016.\n\nProject Purpose\n\nThe primary project objectives were to:\n\nidentify and quantify the linkages and feedbacks among human, hydrologic, and ecologic dimensions of the water system,\n\nmake projections about where and when human activities and climate change will impact future water scarcities,\n\nevaluate how biophysical and human system uncertainties affect these projections, and\n\nevaluate how policy changes or other interventions might affect future water scarcities.\n\nWe recognize that the Willamette River Basin is a complex coupled system, one that includes both a natural system (the biophysical components) and a human system (the socio-economic components). The interactions, feedbacks, and evolving characteristics of these different components will control when and where water is abundant or scarce. Modeling such a system has to be selective: it would be impossible to model all aspects of such a complex system in great detail and high resolution. We therefore chose to focus on the elements, relationships, and feedback mechanisms that were most important to the key objectives described above. Fig. 1 describes at a general level the main components of the Willamette River Basin that we modeled in detail. The components include “external drivers” (factors outside the control of people in the basin), including the climate, population growth, and growth in income levels. This conceptual model identifies components related primarily to water supply and demand. Water supply is mainly determined by the biophysical system. Water demand includes human demands for water that are both direct (urban use) and indirect (water allocated by law to protect fish). At a general level, human decisions influence how land and water is used as a result of laws, regulations, and policies, and these in turn influence how individual decisions are made (farmers, consumers), and how society’s representatives (public officials) act to allocate land and water (e.g., reservoir management).\n\nFigure 1. Conceptual diagram of the Willamette water system showing the human and natural system elements that Willamette Envision represents.\n\nGiven the complexity of the system, and the detailed spatial and temporal scales at which these different components interact and influence each other, an explicit and quantitative representation of this system requires a computer model to incorporate the many processes and relationships in time and space between and among the natural and human system components, so that we are able to predict how those processes are likely to change over time. As a result, we developed Willamette Envision, a computer model that includes sub-models for each of the biophysical and economic components indicated in Fig. 1. The model captures key biophysical and socioeconomic elements of the system that allow us to address the first two objectives. In addition, the model can be used to ask “What if?” questions of interest to applied scientists, policymakers, and the general public. These questions explore the interactions between land and water use, law and policy, and public management of land and water resources. A more detailed description of Willamette Envision is contained in the model overview section.\n\nWebsite Purpose\n\nAs a companion to the project’s scientific publications, this website provides an overview of project methods and findings, and a portal to access publications, data products, and unpublished project materials. It also contains sections describing the project’s broader impacts activities such as engagement with regional stakeholders, and training provided to university students and K-12 students and teachers. This website is intended for use by scientists, water and land managers, policy and decision makers, and educators.\n\nWe present this reflection in the context of three goals developed by the broader impacts team, the group of researchers that led stakeholder engagement activities. By involving regional water managers and users in the project, we sought to:\n\nenhance advancement in science by placing a deliberate emphasis on societal relevance and adaptation,\n\nprovide a mechanism for regional and “boots-on-the-ground” project review,\n\nsupport learning and information exchange among water users, managers, scientists, and educators in the Willamette River Basin (WRB).\n\nGoal 1: enhance advancement in science by placing a deliberate emphasis on societal relevance and adaptation\n\nLAN and TAG meetings did lead to meaningful discussions about regional water policy that influenced the scope and direction of the project. For example, a LAN meeting in May 2012 generated a list of specific water management policies that attendees felt were regionally relevant, and that they wanted to see incorporated into WW2100 modeling and scenarios. The research team then considered each suggestion and where possible adapted model design to accommodate the suggestions. The TAG process – where a group of representative stakeholders designed the constraints for two multivariable scenarios – is another example of how stakeholder knowledge informed the research process. The TAG designed the thematic direction and assumptions for the Extreme and Managed scenarios, and in the process also influenced the direction of many of the single variable human dimensions scenarios.\n\nHowever, there was also tension among participants about the role that stakeholders should play in the research process. Some researchers came from traditions and disciplines that placed a strong emphasis on the value of local knowledge. Others raised concerns about the institutional bias that stakeholders might bring, or had little experience working on teams with non-academic partners. In interviews with researchers and stakeholders, Ferguson (2015) found that the most prevalent challenge mentioned during interviews was diversity of visions for the project. This manifested both within the research team and in the stakeholder engagement aspect of the project, as participants pursued different research or stakeholder engagement goals. Other project challenges mentioned by interviewees included: the logistical difficulties of coordinating so many people, the complexity of the modeling endeavor in and of itself, interpersonal differences among participants, and the challenge of merging research styles from different disciplines.\n\nThe technical challenge of modeling such a complex system led to frustration for some LAN and TAG participants. Development of the model took longer than expected, and this reduced the time and project emphasis placed on the evaluation of policy alternatives and adaptation strategies to mitigate future water scarcity. For example, stream water temperature played an important role in early LAN discussions, because it affects regulatory requirements to protect endangered fish. Yet by project year 5, the research team had not been able to incorporate stream temperature into the integrated model in the way they had hoped.\n\nAnalysis scale was another source of tension between researcher and stakeholder goals. The complexity of the model meant that much of the analysis and interpretation focused at the scale of the entire Willamette watershed, while stakeholder questions and interest often focused on the more localized scale where their management decisions played out. In TAG meetings, participants suggested that analyses at a sub-basin scale could be one direction for future research.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ferguson’s interviews showed that LAN and TAG participants felt that they had contributed to building the model and that the completion of an integrated water model for the basin was a great success for the project. Her survey also showed that participation was positively correlated with participants’ perceptions of feeling heard (rs = .36, p < .001) and valuing the stakeholder engagement process (rs = .39, p < .001).\n\nGoal 2: provide a mechanism for regional and “boots-on-the-ground” project review\n\nWe found that LAN workshops created useful checkpoints where researchers could present progress and receive feedback. This feedback sometimes led to explicit model adjustments, for example, changes in assumptions about farmer planting dates, and careful consideration about how to incorporate Bull Run, the large water source outside the WRB for the city of Portland (Ferguson et. al., 2014). But LAN engagement also sometimes led to frustration, when researchers could not or would not adjust assumptions or model components to match stakeholder experience. This frustration sometimes stemmed from the different perspective of researchers and stakeholders. For example, a sub-group of project researchers developed a model for urban water demand that was guided by the academic literature in economics and, based on this literature, identified water price and household income as the greatest determinants of future residential water demand. But some representatives from urban water providers felt that this model did not adequately represent the influence of water conservation education and technology, or the declines in per capita water demand they had observed in recent decades.\n\nThe complexity of Envision and its modeling components also hindered the regional review process. Pre- and post-event surveys showed that participants came away from LAN meetings with a much greater understanding of modeling components (IWW, 2012; Ferguson, 2015). But some participants felt that it was unrealistic for them to provide meaningful feedback within the one-day, large group format of the annual LAN meetings. Researchers responded to these concerns with follow-up correspondence and meetings, by developing workshop summaries, and by creating an online FAQ document (IWW, 2012; IWW, 2014; Ferguson et. al., 2014).\n\nThe format of the TAG process also helped address these concerns. By involving fewer participants (25) and more frequent (six roughly monthly) half-day meetings, it provided more opportunities for participants to ask questions and share their diverse perspectives. Questions about the limits of the WW2100 model, understanding of the larger Willamette water system, and what constituted Extreme versus Managed futures, prompted further inquiries and conversations between TAG meetings and related model refinements. These questions also led to what several TAG members described as, for them, among the most educational parts of the TAG process.\n\nOne of the benefits of the stakeholder engagement process is that it created awareness about the project among regional water managers. Ferguson’s survey showed that active participants in the WW2100 stakeholder engagement process understood the Willamette Envision model better and found the model to be more useful. In the survey, participation was positively correlated with survey respondents’ perception of the Willamette Envision model’s utility (rs = .32, p = .002) and understanding of the Willamette Envision model (rs = .42, p < .001). Interviewed stakeholders also expressed that through the process they gained an understanding of the model and other water users. They also found the Willamette Envision model more credible than they may have otherwise and implied that they could serve as project ambassadors, sharing the information with their colleagues.\n\nGoal 3: Support learning and information exchange among water users, managers, scientists, and educators in the WRB.\n\nIn Ferguson’s analysis, the most frequently mentioned outcome of the stakeholder engagement was that participants were learning and had an overall positive experience. Interviewed stakeholders valued the process for the opportunity to build relationships with diverse water users, regulators, and researchers and to begin a constructive dialogue about planning now for possible water availability constraints in the future. Some example interview comments included, “I would say that the discussions and the relationship-building have been more beneficial to me than the actual nitty-gritty numbers that it produces,” and “I think just even having that dialogue amongst the users was probably one of the most successful parts of the project.”\n\nWe believe that two key factors enabled these learning successes. First, the goal to develop an integrated model of the Willamette water system created a forum for sharing different regional and sector perspectives. The topic of anticipating water scarcity drew the interest of individuals in many different water-related sectors, and provided an opportunity for different types of water users to learn about and consider how the water system is interconnected. The project’s broad geographic scale and long modeling horizon also freed participants to think about big picture connections. Second, because this was a research project, led by university partners, it created a neutral forum not tied to specific agency perspectives or a short-term management objective. Many stakeholders commented that they had enhanced their whole basin perspective by engaging in WW2100, and that they had few other professional opportunities to build that perspective.\n\nEpilogue\n\nAs educators, we count the learning fostered by the stakeholder engagement process as among the greatest successes of the project, and we hope that it will enhance stewardship of water resources in the basin over the long term. WW2100 was an ambitious biophysical and socioeconomic modeling project that emphasized stakeholder participation as a central way of working. Stakeholder engagement in science is not a new concept. The engagement of researchers and stakeholders in discussions and decision making from project initiation to completion sets WW2100 apart in that the process is itself an experiment. Many examples can be cited on how stakeholder input was incorporated into the model. Examples can also be cited on how stakeholders’ thinking was enhanced by working with the researchers and engaging people from different sectors around a common theme.\n\nThe project revealed that there are needs and questions around water scarcity, climate change, people, policies, and land uses beyond the scope of the project. With many of the results and their interpretation coming only in the latter half of the fifth and final year of the project, we simply ran out of resources (time and funding) to address the many uses that researchers and stakeholders see as valuable from the project. A final stakeholders’ workshop served as a forum for elucidating, prioritizing, and discussing a future action plan. At this meeting, stakeholders identified such unfulfilled research needs such as integrating fish life history with a temperature model, new ways to explore and predict urban water demand that might include conservation and different infrastructure pricing, anticipating additional drivers to farming and irrigation practices, more in-depth analysis on the impacts of water policies, and perhaps even the role of changing water storage capacity in the basin.\n\nOur project is among the first to describe and analyze the engagement process from project inception to completion. We were not perfect. However, our research of the process has revealed that engagement in science from inception to completion provides a societally relevant peer-review process, one that stimulates critical thinking on the applications and needs for water science.\n\nWW2100 hosted a series of webinars about project related topics and components.

Natural resource researchers ideally participate in broader impacts activities to extend the reach of their best available research. Researcher-stakeholder engagement is one proposed solution to overcome barriers to integrating science and management and to achieve both broader impact and science-based policy goals. Literature has documented many researcher-stakeholder engagement process case studies where researchers offer lessons learned and speculate on their impacts, but few offer data on the engagement process structure, the stakeholder perspective of the engagement process, or the impacts of collaboration between academic research teams and scientific stakeholders. This work addresses these gaps by taking a closer look at how one team of researchers engaged with its stakeholders and voicing the perceptions of stakeholders in addition to researchers. Twenty-six semi-structured interviews and an online survey (n=137) were conducted for an in-depth case study of participant motivations to, expectations for, participation in, and outcomes of Willamette Water 2100. Researchers and stakeholders were motivated to participate for social, knowledge, and utility reasons and held different expectations for the roles they would play, the researcher-stakeholder engagement process itself, and the resulting research results. Four types of challenges were identified: lack of a shared vision, differing professional languages, research complexities, and project management. Participants identified successful outcomes including: overcoming challenges, facilitating learning, greater understanding, conversation among diverse perspectives, and improving and extending research results. Researcher-stakeholder engagement in natural resource research can create more relevant science and achieve scientific broader impact goals. This research offers novel evidence of researcher-stakeholder engagement impacts and proposes more specific criteria for broader impact activity evaluation. This research was part of the Willamette Water 2100 project.\n\n--\n\nMay 5, 2015\n\nOptimizing reservoir operations to adapt to climate and social change in the Willamette River Basin, Oregon\n\nPresenter: Ms. Kathleen Moore, Ph.D. Candidate in Geography\n\nDoctoral Advisors Dr. Julia Jones (Geography, CEOAS) and Dr. William Jaeger (Applied Economics)\n\nView recording on OSU Media Space\n\nAbstract: Reservoir systems in the western US are managed to serve two main competing purposes: to reduce flooding during the winter and spring, and to provide water supply for multiple uses during the summer. Because the storage capacity of a reservoir cannot be used for both flood damage reduction and water storage at the same time, these two uses are traded off as the reservoir fills during the transition from the wet to the dry season. Climate change, population growth, and development may exacerbate dry season water scarcity and increase winter flood risk, implying a need to critically evaluate reservoir operations. Focusing on the Willamette River Basin, Oregon, we used a dynamic programming approach to social welfare maximization, and derived the optimal reservoir fill path for both historical conditions and future scenarios of climate and social change. Anticipated future increases in winter flood risk and reductions in spring streamflow led to an optimal fill path in which reservoir fill began earlier and proceeded more slowly, compared to the optimal fill path derived under historical conditions. The analysis finds that increased value of stored water associated with increased demand for reservoir recreation or irrigation water for agriculture will shift the initiation of optimal reservoir fill to an earlier date and increase the likelihood of achieving full pool by the end of May. Conversely, an increase in the costs of flooding driven by land use change and development in the floodplain associated with increasing population led to an optimal fill path in which reservoir fill began later and the final optimal reservoir fill level was decreased, compared to the optimal fill path under historical conditions. These findings may contribute to policies for adapting reservoir management to future changes in water supply and demand.\n\n--\n\nWednesday, November 5, 2014, 1-2 pm -\n\nClimate Change And Upland Forest Dynamics In The Willamette River Basin, Dr. David Turner, Department of Forest Ecosystems & Society, Oregon State University.\n\nView recording on OSU Media Space\n\nAs the potential magnitude of anthropogenically-driven climate change becomes clearer, it is increasingly desirable to anticipate impacts of projected climate change on forest ecosystems and forest landscapes. Notable impacts of climate change on forests will include alteration of the disturbance regime, changes in tree species composition, and shifts in the geographic distribution of vegetation types. These potential impacts have been studied using climate change scenarios and a variety of empirical or process-based modeling approaches, but projections of climate change impacts have generally not included the role of land use. For the Willamette Water 2100 Project, we have applied an agent-based landscape simulation model (Envision) to assess potential climate change impacts in the Willamette River Basin (WRB). Envision accounts for harvesting, fire, and land use change. To incorporate climate change impacts, we have integrated it with results from a dynamic global vegetation model (MC2), driven by climate scenarios developed for the 5th IPCC report. Our goal is to evaluate the sensitivity of forest area, biogeography, rates of fire, rates of harvest, and forest age class distribution to three climate change scenarios. The related influences on basin-wide evapotranspiration are also being simulated and are of interest in evaluating the future WRB water budget.\n\n--\n\nOctober 8, 2014\n\nModeling the Human Side of Water Scarcity in the Willamette Basin, Dr. William Jaeger, Professor, Department of Applied Economics, Oregon State University.\n\nView recording on OSU Media Space\n\nTo predict the when, where, and how of future water scarcity in the Willamette Basin we have developed a model that integrates natural system components of water supply with the human system components of water demand. Constructing an economic model for the human side of this system presents a number of challenges. Some of these are different from and others are similar to the challenges faced by those modeling the biophysical system components.\n\nThis seminar will describe some of those challenges, and explain how we have tried to address them. We’ll describe the models we have constructed for agricultural water use and urban water use. These two models have empirical and theoretical underpinnings, and they have strong similarities as well as important differences. In both cases, the models represent powerful tools for addressing questions about future water scarcity: first, they provide a basis for predicting how the demand for water will grow in the future as human and natural systems change; second, these same models represent a way to quantifying the impact of water availability on social values in terms of the costs or benefits of changing water scarcity, as well as the costs and benefits of policy actions aimed at mitigating water scarcity.\n\n--\n\nThursday, May 22, 2014, 2-3 pm -\n\nThird time's the charm: the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment Report, Dr. Philip Mote, Director, Oregon Climate Change Research Institute.\n\nIn 1990, Congress passed the U.S. Global Change Research Act which among other things calls for an assessment report every four years. On May 6, the President’s Administration released the third National Climate Assessment. This report is by far the most comprehensive, with 30 chapters covering climate change impacts on various regions and sectors, as well as adaptation and mitigation. The report emphasizes that climate change is already noticeable and affecting Americans in a variety of ways, and presents fascinating depth and breadth of evidence. Dr. Mote co-authored the report’s Northwest chapter and served on the report's advisory committee. In this seminar, he gave an overview of the assessment and its findings.\n\nThe webinar was co-sponsored by the Geography program in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, and the Willamette Water 2100 Project.\n\nThe video of Dr. Mote can also be viewed on OSU Media Space.\n\nWednesday, December 18, 2013, 10-11 am -\n\nPotential Responses of Native and Non-native Fish Communities to Thermal Changes in the Willamette River, Dr. Stan Gregory, Oregon State University.\n\nThe video of Dr. Gregory can also be viewed on OSU Media Space.\n\nFriday, May 17, 2013 12-1 pm -\n\nWillamette River Basin Hydrodynamic and Temperature Modeling, Scott Wells, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Portland State University.\n\nView PDF of presentation.\n\nFriday, April 26, 2013 12-1 pm -\n\nModeling ecohydrologic processes in mountain watersheds—implications for the Willamette Watershed, Naomi (Christina) Tague and Elizabeth Garcia, University of Santa Barbara, Bren School of Environmental Science and Management.\n\nThursday, March 21, 2013 1-2 pm - Will We Have to Change the Rules?
