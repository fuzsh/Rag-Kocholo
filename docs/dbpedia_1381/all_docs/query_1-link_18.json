        "text": "What do I love about my church? I love it that 35 people, not all of them church members, walked the Richmond Slave Trail last Sunday afternoon and learned about that heartbreaking piece of our past. It was the perfect thing to do during Black History Month, and I’m grateful to Matthew Hensley, Associate Pastor of Christian Invitation, for organizing and leading the walk.\n\nAt the very first stop I learned that 12 million Africans had been kidnapped from their home continent and carried away into slavery, most of them to the Caribbean and South America but a half million ending up in North America. “Twelve million!” I said, aloud. “That’s twice as many people as the number we use to talk about the Jews who died during the Holocaust.” John Ng’ang’a from Kenya, who was standing next to me, said, “It was probably more than that.”\n\nI know John. I love John. He’s a student in the Baptist House of Studies at Union Presbyterian Seminary and has served as an intern at First Baptist Church. It made the whole experience more meaningful, if more painful, to walk the slave trail alongside an African man and reflect on the way people not so different from him had been herded like cattle onto slave ships, crammed into cargo holds, and ferried across the Atlantic in the most inhumane conditions imaginable. It’s one reason I was there on Sunday: to learn some of our heartbreaking history and think about how we can make things better now for everyone. I don’t have all the answers, but walking the trail makes me a more thoughtful and empathetic partner in the conversation.\n\n—————————\n\nWhile we’re talking about Black History Month, don’t miss the City-Wide Book Read and Panel Discussion, this Monday night at 7:00 pm in the fellowship hall at Richmond’s First Baptist Church. We’re going to be talking about The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin and Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehesi Coates. Our all-star panelists will be David Bailey, Ashley Mejias, and Chris Burton. I’ll be moderating. Even if you don’t have time to read the books, come for the discussion. It’s free!\n\nThis picture is from December 27, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. I was trying to find a way to keep the church connected in a time of physical distancing and social isolation. And so I decided to celebrate the 12 days of Christmas by taking a gift to a different member of the church every day.\n\nI went to see Dot Smith on the Third Day of Christmas, and there probably should have been three French Hens inside that box but there were not (I think it was a mug for hot cocoa and a pair of warm, wool socks). But I chose Dot for a reason and this was it: 1) she lived by herself, 2) she’d been through some illness, and 3) she’d been so good to me.\n\nDot was the one who brought me my breakfast on Sunday mornings. It was an old tradition, probably going back to the time of the legendary Theodore F. Adams, Pastor of Richmond’s First Baptist Church from 1936 to 1968, but on Sunday morning between the 8:30 and 11:00 worship service Dot would knock on my door and then come in pushing a cart on which there was a silver tray.\n\nYou read that right: a silver tray.\n\nOn the tray would be a little something to help me keep my strength up through the 11:00 service: sometimes a full breakfast with eggs, bacon, and a warm biscuit. At other times a croissant with butter and jelly, some fresh fruit, and cheddar cheese. There was always a silver urn full of hot, black coffee (just the way I like it), and most of the time a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.\n\nI didn’t realize until Dot was no longer able to do it just how much of herself she was putting into each breakfast. I still get breakfast, but I don’t get freshly squeezed orange juice. The entire kitchen staff will acknowledge that’s just too much trouble. And I can make my own coffee now, thanks to the Keurig machine in the supply closet. Breakfast still comes on a silver tray, but it’s covered in plastic wrap and usually waiting on my desk when I get back from doing the early service. It’s still delicious, but also different without Dot’s personal touch.\n\nThere were also her regular reassurances, especially when I had said something controversial from the pulpit the week before and not everyone had agreed with me: “Jim, a lot of us love you.” I could read between the lines: “A lot of us love you (but not everyone does).” That’s OK. I got the feeling when she said it that as long as Dot loved me I would be all right.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because today at 2:00 in the sanctuary of First Baptist Church we will remember Dorothy H. Smith, “Dot,” who died just a few weeks ago at the age of 95. No one has ever been more ready to go. When I would see her at the hospital she would pray, “Jesus! Why are you waiting so long!” She may have been thinking of the reunion she would enjoy with her beloved husband, the one she nursed for ten years when he was sick. She may have been thinking that she had lived fifteen years beyond the biblical promise of “fourscore years.” She may have been thinking that with all the illness she had endured death would be almost a relief. But I feel certain that when death finally showed up at her door she welcomed him like an old friend, or maybe like she welcomed me on the Third Day of Christmas, 2020,\n\nLike someone who had come with a gift.\n\nThis may be the beginning of a series, but one of the things I love about my church is what I saw on Sunday.\n\nFive days earlier the deacons had approved a welcome statement that reads: “We affirm the biblical truth that all people are created in God’s image and therefore seek to welcome every person in the Spirit of Christ.” Some of them told me it was nothing new; that we had always been that kind of church.\n\nOn Sunday I saw it.\n\nIt started when our youth came into the sanctuary a little slap-happy and sleep-deprived after a long DiscipleNOW weekend. They were all wearing matching T-shirts, hanging onto each other, laughing at their inside jokes. They filled up the first five pews on both sides of the aisle and tried to settle down for worship.\n\nWhen I looked into the balcony I saw the members of the Alethia Chinese Christian Church filing into the pews. They don’t usually join us for worship but their pastor, Daniel Gong, was in the hospital, recovering from bypass surgery. So instead of going to their usual service at 1:30 in the afternoon, in the choir room, they came to our service at 11:00.\n\nWhen the service got underway Jessalyn Brown, an African-American seminary student from Waco, Texas, and our DiscipleNOW preacher, came to the pulpit to share with the larger congregation some of what she had shared with our youth over the weekend. A little later Danny Taylor, one of our deacons who proudly claims his Indigenous American ancestry, came rolling down the aisle in his motorized wheelchair, having helped take up the offering. Immediately after that Julia Wass, a developmentally disabled teenager, stood with her mother to dedicate the church’s gifts to the glory of God.\n\nI preached on the covenant God made with Noah, from Genesis 9:8-17, and at the end of the service Izzy Moore jumped up off her pew and came forward to ask for baptism. Robert Thompson stood beside me to introduce his first cousin, Joanne Willis, who lives in Roanoke but wants to join the church remotely. Kevin Cook, a radiologist, decided to come forward for membership even though he had worn his blue jeans to church that morning. Our youth, who had worn theirs, quickly assured him that it was no problem at all.\n\nI tell you all this as evidence that our welcome statement is accurate: We do affirm the biblical truth that all people are made in God’s image, and we really do seek to welcome every person in the Spirit of Christ.\n\nOr at least we did last Sunday.\n\nLast Tuesday night the deacons of Richmond’s First Baptist Church approved a welcome statement for our website that reads: “We affirm the biblical truth that all people are created in God’s image and therefore seek to welcome every person in the Spirit of Christ.” It seems like the kind of thing anybody could approve but it took a little while to get there.\n\nOne of our deacons wondered what we were really trying to say with such a message and I made it clear that I wanted to have something I could point to when members of the LGBTQ community ask me if they would be welcome at our church. At our November meeting I had taken an informal survey, asking the deacons how the church relates to that community currently. I asked, “Do we exclude, tolerate, welcome, or affirm?” There were nearly fifty deacons in attendance: a good representation of our congregation. This is what they said.\n\nBut then I asked the deacons how we should relate to the LGBTQ community, and the results were significantly different:\n\nI said, “The gap between where we think we are and where we think we should be is the leadership gap, and the question for us, as leaders, is how do we close that gap?” I suggested that we could read books, have conversations, listen to the stories of actual members of the LGBTQ community, but yes, we could also put a welcome statement on the website. That might be a start.\n\nWe didn’t do it on that day, and we took a break from the conversation in December and January, but last Tuesday night the deacons approved that statement. Some of them said that we’ve always welcomed everyone, and maybe we have. This is an extremely friendly church.\n\nBut it’s kind of nice to have it in writing."
