        "meta_description": "In the ongoing debates about eukaryogenesis—the series of evolutionary events leading to the emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic ancestors—members of the Asgard archaea play a key part as the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes1. However, the nature and phylogenetic identity of the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved2–4. Here we analyse distinct phylogenetic marker datasets of an expanded genomic sampling of Asgard archaea and evaluate competing evolutionary scenarios using state-of-the-art phylogenomic approaches. We find that eukaryotes are placed, with high confidence, as a well-nested clade within Asgard archaea and as a sister lineage to Hodarchaeales, a newly proposed order within Heimdallarchaeia. Using sophisticated gene tree and species tree reconciliation approaches, we show that analogous to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, genome evolution in Asgard archaea involved significantly more gene duplication and fewer gene loss events compared with other archaea. Finally, we infer that the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea was probably a thermophilic chemolithotroph and that the lineage from which eukaryotes evolved adapted to mesophilic conditions and acquired the genetic potential to support a heterotrophic lifestyle. Our work provides key insights into the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition and a platform for better understanding&nbsp;the emergence of cellular complexity in eukaryotic cells. Analyses of multiple phylogenetic marker datasets of Asgard archaea provide insight into the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, specifically placing eukaryotes within Asgard archaea and as a sister lineage to Hodarchaeales.",

        "text": "Sample collection, sequencing, assembly and binning\n\nWe sampled aquatic sediments from 11 geographically distant sites: Guaymas Basin (Mexico); Lau Basin (Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge, south-west Pacific Ocean); Hydrate Ridge (offshore of Oregon, USA); Aarhus Bay (Denmark); Radiata Pool (New Zealand); Taketomi Island Vent (Japan); the White Oak River estuary (USA); and Tibet Plateau and Tengchong (China) (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSampling permissions\n\nThe following sampling permits were used: Guaymas Basin (DAPA/2/251108, DAPA/2/131109/3958 and CONAPESCA); ABE and Mariner field (TN-002-2015, Kingdom of Tonga); and Radiata pool (77982-RES, Department of Conservation (New Zealand)). No permits were needed for obtaining any of the other samples described in this study. Additional information regarding sampling years and responsible scientists are available in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nTibet Plateau and Yunnan Province\n\nFor Jordarchaeia JZB50, QC4B49, QZMA23B3, QZMA2B5 and QZMA3B5, samples from hot spring sediment were collected from Tibet Plateau and Yunnan Province (China) in 2016. The microbial community compositions have been described and previously reported54,55. Samples were collected from the hot spring pools using a sterile iron spoon into 50 ml sterile plastic tubes, then transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at –80 °C until DNA extraction. The genomic DNA of the sediment samples was extracted using a FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The obtained genomic DNA was purified for library construction and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform (2× 150 bp). The raw reads were filtered to remove Illumina adapters, PhiX and other Illumina trace contaminants using BBTools (v.38.79), and low-quality bases and reads were removed using Sickle (v.1.33; https://github.com/najoshi/sickle). The filtered reads were assembled using metaSPAdes (v.3.10.1) with a kmer set of “21, 33, 55, 77, 99, 127”. The filtered reads were mapped to the corresponding assembled scaffolds using bowtie2 (v.2.3.5.1)56. The coverage of a given scaffold was calculated using the command of jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths in MetaBAT (v.2.12.1)57. For each sample, scaffolds with a minimum length of 2.5 kbp were binned into genome bins using MetaBAT (v.2.12.1), with both tetranucleotide frequencies and scaffold coverage information considered. The clustering of scaffolds from the bins and the unbinned scaffolds was visualized using ESOM with a minimum window length of 2.5 kbp and a maximum window length of 5 kbp, as previously described58. Misplaced scaffolds were removed from bins, and unbinned scaffolds for which segments were placed within the bin areas of ESOMs were added to the corresponding bins. Scaffolds with a minimum length of 1 kbp were uploaded to ggKbase (http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/). The ESOM-curated bins were further evaluated based on consistency of GC content, coverage and taxonomic information, and scaffolds identified with abnormal information were removed. The ggKbase genome bins were individually curated to fix local assembly errors using ra2.py59.\n\nABE and Mariner hydrothermal vent fields\n\nFor Heimdallarchaeia A173, A3132 and M288, and Thorarchaeia A361, A381 and A399, hydrothermal vent deposits were collected from ABE (ABE 1, 176° 15.48′ W, 21° 26.68′ S, 2,142 m; ABE 3, 176° 15.59′ W, 21° 26.95′ S, 2,131 m) and Mariner (176° 36.07′ W, 22° 10.81′ S, 1,914 m) vent fields along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center in April and May of 2015 during the RR1507 Expedition on the RV Roger Revelle. Sample collection and processing were done as previously described60. DNA was extracted from homogenized rock slurries using a DNeasy PowerSoil kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were prepared for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 using Nextera DNA Library Prep kits (Illumina), and metagenomes (2× 150 bp) were sequenced at the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research and Computing. Trimmomatic (v.0.36)61 was used to trim low-quality regions and adapter sequences from raw reads (parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10, LEADING:20, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, MINLEN:50). Clean paired reads were then interleaved using the khmer software package62. Interleaved and unpaired reads were assembled using MEGAHIT (v.1.1.1-2-g02102e1) (--k-min 31, --k-max 151, --k-step 20, --min-contig-len 1000)63,64. Trimmed reads were mapped back to the contigs to determine read coverage using Bowtie 2 (v.2.2.9)56,65 and SAMtools (v.1.3.1)66. Binning was performed using MetaBAT (v.0.32.4)57 and tetranucleotide frequency and read coverage. Bin completion and contamination were estimated using CheckM (v.1.0.7)67.\n\nAarhus Bay\n\nFor Lokiarchaeia ABR01, ABR02, ABR03, ABR04, ABR05, ABR06, ABR08, ABR11, ABR13 and ABR15, Thorarchaeia ABR09 and ABR10 and Heimdallarchaeia ABR14 and ABR16, MAGs were obtained as previously described29.\n\nWhite Oak River\n\nFor Sifarchaeia WORA1, Hermodarchaeia WORB2, Heimdallarchaeia WORE3, Lokiarchaeia WORB4 and WORC5, and Thorarchaeia WORH6, sampling, DNA extraction, sequencing library preparation and sequencing methods were performed as previously described68. Published assemblies and raw reads for the samples WOR-1-36_30 (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioSample identifier SAMN06268458; Joint Genome Institute (JGI) identifier Gp0056175), WOR-1-52-54 (SAMN06268416; Gp0059784), WOR-3-24_28 (SAMN06268417; Gp0059785) were downloaded from the JGI. Short reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v.0.33)61 (PE ILLUMINACLIP:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MILEN:100). Contigs shorter than 1,000 bp were excluded from the assembly using SeqTK (v.1.0r75) (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Each assembly was binned using CONCOCT (v.0.4.1)69 and coverage information from the three datasets, and Asgard bins were subsequently identified based on phylogenies of concatenated ribosomal proteins3. Identified Asgard MAGs were used together with publicly available Asgard genomes to recruit trimmed reads originated from Asgard genomes using CLARK (v.1.2.3) with the -m 0 option70. For each dataset, recruited Asgard reads were independently assembled using SPAdes71 and IDBA-UD72 and further binned using CONCOCT, using a minimum contig length of 1,000 bp. Bins with higher completeness and lower contamination values as predicted by miComplete (v.1.00)73 were selected and manually curated using mmgenome (v.0.7.1)74,75 using the coverage information, paired-reads linkage, composition and marker genes information. The samples and assembly method used for each final MAG were as follows: Sifarchaeia WORA1 (WOR-1-52-54; spades); Hermodarchaeia WORB2 (WOR-1-52-54; IDBA-UD); Heimdallarchaeia WORE3 (WOR-3-24_28; spades); Lokiarchaeia WORB4 and WORC5 (WOR-1-36_30; IDBA-UD); and Thorarchaeia WORH6 (WOR-1-36_30; spades).\n\nRadiata Pool hot springs\n\nFor Jordarchaeia RPD1 and RPF2, and Odinarchaeia RPA3, information about the location of the hot spring sediments from Radiata Pool, sampling and DNA extraction procedures has been previously reported3. Short paired-end Illumina reads were generated and preprocessed using Scythe (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe) and Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) to remove adapters and low-quality reads. Reads were subsequently assembled with IDBA-UD 1.1.3 (--maxk 124). The Jordarchaeia RPF2 MAG was generated by binning contigs according to their tetranucleotide frequencies using esomWrapper.pl (https://github.com/tetramerFreqs/Binning) with a minimum contig length of 5,000 bp and a window size of 10 kbp. ESOM maps were manually delineated using the Databionic ESOM viewer (http://databionic-esom.sourceforge.net/). Jordarchaeia RPD1 and Odinarchaeia RPA3 were binned following the previously described29 methodology, but re-assembling the recruited reads only with IDBA-UD (--maxk 124)72.\n\nGuaymas Basin\n\nFor Asgardarchaeia GBS01, Baldrarchaeia GBS02, GBS03, and GBS04, Jordarchaeia GBS05, GBS06 and GBS07, Heimdallarchaeia GBS08, GBS09, GBS10, GBS11, GBS15, GBS16, GBS17, GBS18, GBS19, GBS20, GBS21, GBS22, GBS23, GBS24, GBS25, GBS26 and TNS08, Lokiarchaeia GBS14, and Thorarchaeia GBS28, GBS29, GBS33 and GBS34, MAGs were obtained as previously described76. For Heimdallarchaeia GBS09, the MAG was obtained as previously described77.\n\nSouth Hydrate Ridge\n\nFor Heimdallarchaeia GBS11, samples were made available by the Gulf Coast Repository (GCR) and were collected on the Ocean drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 at site 1244 (44° 35.17 N, 125° 7.19 W) on 14 July 2002 (hole C and core 2). The ODP site is found at a water depth of 890 m on the eastern side of the South Hydrate Ridge on the Cascadia Margin. This site has been well characterized physically and geochemically78. Furthermore, the microbial community structure has been surveyed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing79,80. Two sediment samples, designated DCO-2-5 (sample identifier 1489929) and DCO-2-7 (sample identifier 1489924), were collected at a sediment depth of 12.40 and 14.96 m below the seafloor, respectively, and stored at –80 °C at GCR. A total of 10 g of each of the two sediment samples was used to extract DNA using a MoBio DNA PowerSoil Total kit. A total of 100 ng DNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries that were 150 bp paired-end sequenced at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, USA) on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Adaptors and DNA spike-ins were removed from the forward and reverse reads using cutadapt (v.1.12)81. Afterwards, reads were interleaved using interleave_fasta.py (https://github.com/jorvis/biocode/blob/master/fasta/interleave_fasta.py) and further trimmed using Sickle with default settings (Fass JN) (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle). Metagenomic reads from both samples were co-assembled using IDBA-UD with the following parameters: --pre_correction, --mink 75, --maxk 105, --step 10, --seed_kmer 55 (ref. 72). Metagenomic binning was performed on scaffolds with a length of >3,000 bp using ESOM, including a total of 4,939 scaffolds with a length of 30,693,002 bp58,72. CheckM (v.1.0.5) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the binning approach by determining the percentage of completeness and contamination67.\n\nExploration of phylogenetic diversity in Asgard archaeal assemblies and MAGs\n\nTo assess the presence of potential Asgard-related lineages in our assemblies, we reconstructed a phylogeny of ribosomal proteins encoded in a conserved RP15 gene cluster82. As the in-group, we used all MAGs presented in this study, plus all genomes classified as Asgard archaea in the NCBI database as of 25 June 2021, plus those classified as ‘archaeon’ corresponding to Hermodarchaeia (GCA_016550385.1, GCA_016550395.1, GCA_016550405.1, GCA_016550415.1, GCA_016550425.1, GCA_016550485.1, GCA_016550495.1 and GCA_016550505.1), and all Asgard archaeal MAGs released in previous study19. To obtain an adequate outgroup dataset, we downloaded all archaeal genomes from the Genome Taxonomy Database83, release 89, and selected one genome sequence per species-level cluster as previously defined (https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release89/89.0/sp_clusters_r89.tsv). We then selected a set of 216 genomes classified as Bathyarchaeia, Nitrososphaeria and Thermoprotei, and used them as the outgroup. Genes were detected and individually aligned and trimmed as previously described3. Ribosomal protein sequences were selected if they were encoded in a contig containing at least 5 out of the 15 ribosomal protein genes. ModelFinder84 was run as implemented in IQ-TREE (v.2.0-rc2) to identify the best model among all combinations of the LG, WAG, JTT and Q.pfam models, as well as their corresponding mixture models by adding +C20, +C40 and +C60, and the additional mixture models LG4M, LG4X, UL2 and UL3, with rate heterogeneity (none, +R4 and +G4) and frequency parameters (none, +F). A PMSF approximation85 of the chosen model (WAG+C60+R4+F) was then used for a final reconstruction using 100 nonparametric bootstrap pseudoreplicates for branch statistical support. The obtained tree revealed a broad genomic diversity of Asgard lineages (Fig. 1).\n\nGene prediction\n\nGene prediction was performed using Prokka (v.1.12)86 (prokka --kingdom Archaea --norrna --notrna). rRNA genes and tRNA genes were predicted using Barrnap (https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap) and tRNAscan-SE87,88, respectively.\n\nOGT prediction\n\nOGT values were predicted for the genomes presented here based on genomic and proteomic features89 (Supplementary Information). As rRNA nucleotide compositions are used in this method, only genomes with predicted rRNAs were analysed.\n\nIdentification of homologous protein families\n\nAll-versus-all similarity searches of all predicted proteins from the A64 taxon selection (64 Asgard, 76 TACK, 43 Euryarchaea and 41 DPANN archaea; Supplementary Table 2) were performed using diamond90 BLASTp (--more-sensitive --evalue 0.0001 --max-target-seqs 0 --outfmt 6). The file generated was used to cluster protein sequences into homologous families using SiLiX (v.1.2.10)91 followed by Hifix (v.1.0.6)92. The identity and overlap parameters required by Silix were set to 0.2 and 0.7, respectively, after inspecting a wide range of values (--ident [0.15,0.4] and --overlap [0.55–0.9], with increments of 0.05) and selecting the values that maximized the number of clusters containing at least 80% of the taxa.\n\nFunctional annotation of homologous protein families\n\nProtein families, excluding singletons, were aligned using mafft-linsi (v.7.402)93 and converted into HHsearch format (.hhm) profiles using HHblits (v.3.0.3)94. Profile–profile searches were subsequently performed against a database containing profiles from EggNOG (v.4.5)95, arCOGs96 and Pfam databases97 that had been previously converted to the hhm format using HHblits (v.3.0.3)94.\n\nDetailed analysis of ESPs\n\nIn-depth analysis of potential ESPs involved a combination of automatic screens and manual curation. We first manually searched for homologues of previously described ESPs2,3,38 by using a variety of sequence similarity approaches such as BLAST, HMMer tools, profile–profile searches using HHblits, combined with phylogenetic inferences, and, in some cases, the Phyre2 structure homology search engine94,98,99. We did not use fixed cutoffs, as the e-value between homologues will vary depending on the protein investigated, hence the need for manual examination of potential homologues and a combination of lines of evidence.\n\nIn addition, to identify potential new ESPs, we first used our profile–profile searches against EggNOG and manually investigated Asgard orthologous groups that had a best hit to a eukaryotic-specific EggNOG cluster. We also extracted Pfam domains for which the taxonomic distribution are exclusive to eukaryotes as per Pfam (v.32), and investigated cases in which they represented the best domain hit in Asgard archaea sequences identified by HMMscan. Finally, we manually investigated dozens of proteins known to be involved in key eukaryotic functions based on our knowledge and literature searches. In Fig. 2, we are only reporting cases based on the strict cutoff that the diagnostic HMM profile had the best score among all profiles detected for a protein. An exception was made for the ESCRT domain Vps28, Steadiness box, UEV, Vps25, NZF, GLUE and Vps22 domains, which are usually found in combination with other protein domains and thus do not necessarily represent the best scoring domain in a protein even if they represent true homologues.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses of concatenated proteins for species tree inference\n\nTwo sets of phylogenetic markers were used to infer the species tree. The first one (RP56) is based on a previously published dataset of 56 ribosomal proteins used to place the first assembled Asgard genomes3. The second one (NM57, for new markers) corresponds to 57 proteins extracted from a set of 200 markers previously identified as core archaeal proteins that can be used to confidently infer the tree of archaea100. These 57 markers were selected because they were found in at least one-third of representatives of each of the 11 Asgard clades, as well as in 10 out of 14 eukaryotes, and were inherited from archaea in eukaryotes.\n\nWe initially assembled a RP56 dataset for a phylogenetically diverse set of 222 archaeal and 14 eukaryotic taxa. These included all 11 Asgard archaea MAGs and genomes available at the NCBI as of 12 May 2017, as well as the 53 most diverse new MAGs from this work (out of 63). We gathered orthologues of these genes from all proteomes by using sequences from the previously published alignment3,100 as queries for BLASTp. For each marker, the best BLAST hit from each proteome was added to the dataset. For the first iteration, each dataset was aligned using mafft-linsi101 and ambiguously aligned positions were trimmed using BMGE (-m BLOSUM30)102. All 56 trimmed ribosomal protein alignments were concatenated into a RP56-A64 supermatrix (236 taxa including 64 Asgard archaea, 6,332 amino acid positions). Once this taxon set was gathered, we identified homologues of the NM57 gene set as described above, thus generating supermatrix NM57-A64 (236 taxa, 14,847 amino acid positions).\n\nWe carried out a large number of phylogenomic analyses on variations of these two RP56-A64 and NM57-A64 datasets with different phylogenetic algorithms. Notably, preparing these datasets must be done with great care and is therefore time-consuming, and subsequent phylogenomic analyses generally require an enormous amount of computational running time. However, the rapid expansion of available Asgard archaeal MAGs, notably in a previous publication4, urged us to update and re-run many of the computationally demanding analyses. As some of the work that was based on a more restrained taxon sampling is still deemed valuable, such as some of the Bayesian phylogenomic analyses and ancestral genome content reconstructions, we retained these in the current study.\n\nAn updated Asgard archaeal genomic sequence dataset was constructed by including all 230 Asgard archaeal MAGs and genomes available at the NCBI database as of 12 May 2021, as well as 63 new MAGs described in the current work. All 56 trimmed ribosomal protein alignments were concatenated into an RP56-A293 supermatrix (465 taxa including 293 Asgard archaea, 7,112 amino acid positions), which was used to infer a preliminary phylogeny using FastTree (v.2)103 (Supplementary Fig. 16). Given the high computational demands of the subsequent analyses, we then used this phylogeny to select a subsample of Asgard archaea representatives. For this, we first removed the most incomplete MAGs encoding fewer than 19 ribosomal proteins (that is, one-third of the markers) in the matrix. We also used the preliminary phylogeny to subselect among closely related taxa: among taxa that were separated by branch lengths of <0.1, we only kept one representative. This led to a selection of 331 genomes, including 175 Asgard archaea, 41 DPANN, 43 Euryarchaea and 72 TACK representatives (RP56-A175 dataset). Out of these 175 Asgard archaea, 41 correspond to MAGs newly reported here. Once this taxon set was gathered, we identified homologues of the NM57 gene set as described above, thus generating supermatrix NM57-A175 (15,733 amino acid positions). All datasets and their composition are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nTo test for potential phylogenetic reconstruction artefacts, our datasets were subjected to several treatments. Supermatrices were recoded into four categories using the SR4 scheme25. The corresponding phylogenies were reconstructed using IQ-TREE (using a user-defined previously described model referred to as C60SR4 based on the implemented C60 model and modified to analyse the recoded data3) and Phylobayes (under the CAT+GTR model). We also used the estimated site rate output generated by IQ-TREE (-wsr) to classify sites into 10 categories, from the fastest to the slowest evolving, and we removed them in a stepwise fashion, removing from 10% to 90% of the data. Finally, we combined both approaches by applying SR4 recoding to the alignments obtained after each fast-site removal step. All phylogenetic analyses performed are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. See Supplementary Information for details and discussion.\n\nAnalyses of individual proteins\n\nFor individual proteins of interest, we gathered homologues using various approaches depending on the level of conservation across taxa. To detect putative Asgard homologues of eukaryotic proteins, we used a combination of tools, including BLASTp104 and the HMMer toolkit (http://hmmer.org/) if HMM profiles were available, and queried a local database containing our 240 archaeal representatives (including all Asgard predicted proteomes). We then investigated the Asgard candidates as following: (1) using them as seed for BLASTp searches against the nr database; (2) 3D modelling using Phyre2 and SwissModel when sequence similarity was low; (3) annotating them using Interproscan (v.5.25-64.0)105, EggNOG mapper (v.0.12.7)106, against the NOG database106, and GhostKoala annotation server107; (4) annotating the archaeal orthologous cluster they belonged to using profile–profile annotation as described above. Eukaryotic homologues were gathered from the UniRef50 database108. Depending on the divergence between homologues, they were aligned using mafft-linsi and trimmed using TrimAl109 (--automated1) or BMGE102, or, in cases where we investigated a specific functional domain, we used the hmmalign tool from the HMMer package with the --trim flag to only keep and align the region corresponding to this domain. When divergence levels allowed, phylogenetic analyses were performed using IQ-TREE with model testing including the C-series mixture models (-mset option)110. Statistical support was evaluated using 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (for IQ-TREE)109.\n\nAncestral reconstruction\n\nFor the ancestral reconstruction analyses, only a subset of 181 taxa were included (64 Asgard, 74 TACK and 43 Euryarchaea; see Supplementary Table 2 for details). Protein families with more than three members were aligned and trimmed using mafft-linsi (v.7.402)101 and trimAl (v.1.4.rev15) with the --gappyout option109. Tree distributions for individual protein families were estimated using IQ-TREE (v.1.6.5) (-bb 1000 -bnni -m TESTNEW -mset LG -madd LG+C10,LG+C20 -seed 12345 -wbtl -keep-ident)111. The species phylogeny together with the gene tree distributions were subsequently used to compute 100 gene–tree species tree reconciliations using ALEobserve (v.0.4) and ALEml_undated112,113, including the fraction_missing option that accounts for incomplete genomes. The genome copy number was corrected to account for the extinction probability per cluster (https://github.com/maxemil/ALE/commit/136b78e). The missing fraction of the genome was calculated as 1 minus the completeness values (in fraction) as estimated by CheckM (v.1.0.5) for each of the 181 taxa67. Protein families containing only one protein (singletons) were considered as originations at the corresponding leaf. The ancestral reconstruction of 5 protein families that included more than 2,000 proteins raised errors and could not be computed. The minimum threshold of the raw reconciliation frequencies for an event to be considered was set to 0.3 as commonly done114,115,116,117 and recommended by the authors of ALE (G. Szölősi, personal communication).\n\nAncestral metabolic inferences\n\nMetabolic reconstruction of the Asgard ancestors was based on the inference, annotation and copy number of genes in ancestral nodes. The presence of a given gene was scored if its copy number in the ancestral nodes was above 0.3. A protein family was scored as ‘maybe present’ if the inferred copy number was between 0.1 and 0.3. The protein annotation of each of the clusters containing the ancestral nodes was manually verified for each of the enzymatic steps involved in the pathways, as detailed in Supplementary Table 4.\n\nReporting summary"
