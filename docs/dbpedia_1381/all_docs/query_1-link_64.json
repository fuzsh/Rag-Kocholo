Your ideas have the power to innovate and transform. 🚀 Don't let hesitation or self-doubt stop you from bringing your unique perspective to the table. Your #contributions matter more than you know. ☺️ Let’s continue to #support each other, #encourage the exchange of ideas, and foster a tech community where everyone’s creativity and innovation can thrive. 💪✨ Susen Poppe | Kristina Weber | Nadja Medeiros #womenintech #empowerment #womensupportingwomen\n\nIf you are struggling with what is the AI wave all about? 🤯 - Check out this #Generative #AI for #Beginners Blog Series 💡🚀 What will you learn from the different blogs? 🤓 Part 1 – Introduction to AI Part 2 - Understanding Machine Learning Part 3 - Basics of Deep Learning Part 4 – Introduction to Generative AI Part 5 – What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

Your voice deserves to be heard, and your contributions are vital. 🚀 Don't hesitate to make your presence known! One of my tips is that I politely interrupt and say something like this ⬇️ \"[Name], can you please hold your thoughts? [pause for a second] I have not finished my point. [And then continue with your point].\" Let me know if this helps ☺️ Let's stand together, support one another, and build a more inclusive tech community where everyone's voice matters. 💪✨ Susen Poppe | Collette Ijeoma | Christina Beck | Kristina Weber | Verena Leymann | Nadja Medeiros #WomenInTech #SpeakUp #Empowerment\n\nSharing business #thoughts and career #advice in an „Ask-the-SAP-Expert“ interview with Jon Simmonds for Eursap. Here a short passage from the #interview: „It’s always great to have some kind of #community of people around you who are like-minded and #encourage you, from my personal network of my family and friends and my partner, but also to my colleagues and my mentors and coaches. It’s important also to have people who have your back and say, “go for it”, “you’re doing great”.

In the past months, I had the pleasure of being joined by my dual students Florian Schmidt and Alexander Siege! Well, what can I say .... besides they are #amazing! Their quick understanding of the task, their fast delivery and the quality of the output were outstanding. I want to extend a huge thank you to both of them for their fabulous work and for being great colleagues to be around. But you might wonder what this caterpillar has to do with all of this? 🐛 Great question! 🙌🏻 The caterpillar is a thank-you gift from them for the past months. BTW: The caterpillar is not only a backpack and a soft toy but also contains a lot of sweets and chocolate in caterpillar form. I think it is needless to say that I was blown away by that gift and I wore it with pride cycling back home 🙌🏻 🚀 What I learned from this experience and from a conversation with a great colleague at work is that if you care and if you show and act with care then you can: 1. Influence your work environment and generate a positive impact 2. it will come back to you and you can benefit from the positivity So, what I say with that is start CARING!
