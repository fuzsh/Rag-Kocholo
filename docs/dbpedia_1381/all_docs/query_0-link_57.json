        "text": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The Baltimore Ravens typically want their rookie offensive linemen to earn their spot atop the depth chart. Only in select cases, like in 2016 when they used the sixth pick on left tackle Ronnie Stanley and 2022 when they selected center Tyler Linderbaum 25th overall, has a rookie lineman been anointed a starter from day one.\n\nWhen the Ravens selected offensive tackle Roger Rosengarten with a second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, the team’s decision-makers made clear that they believed the former Washington standout was capable of starting right away, but he certainly wasn’t going to get handed the job.\n\nWith the team less than two full weeks into training camp, Rosengarten got his first extended look as the starting right tackle in Thursday’s practice. And it doesn’t figure to be a one-day thing, either.\n\n“I thought Roger has been doing well,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Thursday. “I thought he deserved a shot with the ones, you saw him get a shot with the ones today. So, we’ll just keep working through that and let it play out.”\n\nHarbaugh said initially that he’d love to have his starting offensive line set within the first few weeks of camp. He acknowledged that may not be realistic as Baltimore looks to fill three openings following the free-agent departures of starting guards Kevin Zeitler and John Simpson and the trade of right tackle Morgan Moses.\n\nAndrew Vorhees appears to have a firm grasp on the left guard job. Harbaugh has said the team wants to give Daniel Faalele a long look in the right guard spot, and that process is ongoing. Veteran Patrick Mekari has been a fixture at right tackle, until Thursday when Rosengarten and Mekari mixed in.\n\nMekari has made 36 starts for the Ravens over five NFL seasons, mostly playing one of the tackle positions in recent years. He made himself into a hugely valuable piece up front because of his ability to play all five offensive line spots.\n\nThe Ravens have always said they’re going to get their best five offensive linemen on the field. However, the right tackle decision might come down to just how much they value Mekari in that sixth offensive lineman role and how much they feel Rosengarten would benefit from not having to play extensive snaps immediately.\n\n“It’s certainly part of the challenge,” Harbaugh said when asked how Mekari’s importance as the team’s sixth offensive lineman will be weighed with getting the best five on the field. “That’s part of it. His greatest strength is his versatility. It’s also … a thorn in his side a little bit. He doesn’t get the chance always to lock down at one position. That’s a good problem to have, and we’re trying to work through that, too.”\n\nFor his part, Mekari is not about to campaign for a starting role.\n\n“I just want to play, and I want to help the team,” he said Thursday. “In whatever way that looks like, that’s up to the coaches and front office. That’s for them to decide.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nMark Andrews, Isaiah Likely show why Ravens should use more 12 personnel groupings\n\nBeating the heat\n\nWith temperatures on the field in the 100-degree range and the Ravens in the middle of a stretch where they’re practicing for six consecutive days, Harbaugh made a few alterations.\n\nBaltimore held the special teams portion of practice indoors. Most of the players who don’t take special teams reps warmed up inside before the start of practice. Harbaugh also called practice about 20 minutes earlier than what was originally scheduled.\n\n“​​We decided we wanted to shorten up a little bit of the time that they were out here with the humidity and everything,” Harbaugh said. “I think it helped.”\n\nThe Ravens were in pads and Harbaugh felt the players handled the conditions well. It appeared that everybody finished practice except guard Ben Cleveland, who departed the field to undergo testing for a potential concussion.\n\nThere was one minor scuffle, as undrafted rookie offensive lineman Julian Pearl exchanged shoves with outside linebacker Quincy Roche and a few other defenders. Cooler heads, though, prevailed and the fight fizzled out quickly.\n\nOther thoughts, observations\n\n• There has been plenty written and said about the need for Lamar Jackson to improve his deep ball accuracy this season. Thursday was not a great day in that regard for Jackson, but it wasn’t entirely on him. He did have a few overthrows, but he also made a very nice throw down the far sideline. However, the ball hit off the extended hands of Rashod Bateman, who was well covered by Brandon Stephens. On another deep shot, Jackson allowed tight end Mark Andrews to go up and make a play. Andrews had his hands on the ball, but it popped out as he hit the ground and landed in the lap of safety Kyle Hamilton for an interception.\n\n• Hamilton’s matchup with tight end Isaiah Likely in one-on-ones has been one of the highlights of camp. Hamilton got the best of Likely in two reps Thursday. Likely slipped down on the first one. On the second one, Hamilton ran stride for stride with the tight end to force an incompletion. Other highlights of the one-on-one session included undrafted rookie Dayton Wade getting free from Damarion Williams and Bump Cooper Jr. to make two catches, Andrews making a sliding catch against a well-positioned Eddie Jackson, Arthur Maulet making a diving pass breakup against Malik Cunningham, and Keith Kirkwood shaking Ka’dar Hollman to make a deep catch. It was not a great period for tight end Scotty Washington, who had two drops and had a third opportunity slapped away by rookie safety Sanoussi Kane.\n\n• The Ravens consider linebacker Malik Harrison to be one of the unsung players who make their defense as versatile as it is. There’s a reason why Baltimore prioritized re-signing him this offseason. In addition to being a core special teams player, Harrison plays strong-side linebacker on early downs, setting the edge against the run and being physical with tight ends and running backs. Harrison is also one of the team’s top reserve inside linebackers. He’s gotten reps at both spots throughout the summer and had his best day yet of what’s been a very strong start to camp for the 26-year-old. He elevated to intercept a Josh Johnson pass in the middle of the field. He also recovered a fumble by rookie Rasheen Ali. Kane intercepted a pass from sixth-round rookie Devin Leary for the defense’s fourth turnover of the day.\n\n• The offensive play of the day was delivered by wide receiver Tylan Wallace, who made a tough catch of a Jackson pass with cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis and safety Marcus Williams converging on him. Wallace steadied himself after the contact and headed to the end zone for a touchdown. It’s been a relatively quiet start to training camp for Wallace, who was trying to win a reserve receiver spot. However, he made the team last year on the strength of strong performances in the preseason games. He’ll get that opportunity again this year.\n\n• Otherwise, Armour-Davis had another standout practice. He forced Wallace into an out-of-bounds incompletion in their one-on-one matchup. Armour-Davis also was well-positioned on two or three other incompletions during practice. The third-year cornerback who has struggled to remain healthy has probably improved his status over the first two weeks of camp more than anyone on the roster.\n\n• On the first play of full-squad work, Travis Jones got a step on Vorhees and touched down Jackson for a sack just as the quarterback was getting rid of the ball. Jones is having a monster camp. He’s opened a lot of eyes in Owings Mills and figures to have a significant role on defense.\n\n(Photo: Nick Wass / Associated Press)"
