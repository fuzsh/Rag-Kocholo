Atlético Madrid have confirmed the signing of Daniel Wass from Valencia. The 32-year-old joins Diego Simeone’s side on a deal until 2023, per a club announcement on Thursday night.

Atlético lost Kieran Trippier to Newcastle United earlier in the winter transfer market and have replaced the Englishman with a versatile, experienced player.

“His ability to play in defence and midfield and to make a difference on both ends of the pitch makes him a valuable addition to Simeone’s side,” the club’s announcement read.

José Bordalás, Valencia’s manager, was initially against the idea of letting Wass leave for a top four rival. But Atlético strengthened their bid and came back in for the Dane. The two sides reached agreement earlier this week on a transfer worth nearly €3 million, and Wass has signed an initial 18-month contract. Reportedly, there is an option that could see the contract extended to 2024.

“After 136 games, 14 goals and 20 assists (at Celta Vigo), the Dane was signed by Valencia in 2018. His versatility has also allowed him to shine at Mestalla, where he has produced 15 goals and 20 assists in 152 matches,” Atlético’s statement said.

Atlético’s title defense never really got going this season, a year after winning LaLiga in heroic fashion against Real Valladolid on the season’s final day. They are embroiled in a battle for Champions League football, and Simeone obviously sees his defense as an area of concern with 16 games left and a key Champions League clash against Manchester United on the horizon.
