On April 2, 2023, the patriarch of our family, Ronald Charles Paul, (Dad, Grandpa, Ron, RCP) passed away surrounded by family and love.

Born on June 10, 1942, Ron was a wonderful father, loving and devoted husband and genuinely good person. He is survived by his wife of almost 60 years, Marti (Ardis) Paul, his three children, Shari Paul, Shelley (Paul) and Terry Oachs and Rob and Lisa Paul, and four grandchildren, Garrett and Logan Oachs and Charlie and Savannah Paul.

Ron always had a song in his heart and on his lips. He shared his love of song with whoever would listen. Unfortunately he also knew disappointment in his life as he was an avid Minnesota Vikings fan. He has passed the torch to his family who is hoping for a Vikings Superbowl so we can share it with RCP.

A celebration of life is planned on June 10th in Chandler AZ.

In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to the American Heart Association in the name of Ronald C. Paul.

Ron was deeply loved and will be deeply missed by his entire family.

Plant a tree: How does it work

When your purchase is complete, a post will be made on the tribute wall of the deceased signifying the planting of a memorial tree.

An official certificate recognizing your purchase will be included with your email receipt. You can then forward the email to the family or print it and give it to them personally.

After an order is placed, our forestry partners will plant the tree in the area of greatest need (nearest the funeral home), according to the planting schedule for the year.

Due to seasonal conditions, the tree planting takes place during the spring and summer.
