        "text": "With the increasing ability of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has evolved as a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where instead of fine- tuning the parameters of an LLM specific to a downstream task with labeled examples,a small number of such examples is appended to a prompt instruction for controlling the decoder's generation process. ICL, thus, is conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as k-NN,where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples). This suggests that a test instance in ICL is analogous to a query in IR, and similar examples in ICL retrieved from a training set relate to a set of documents retrieved from a collection in IR. While standard unsupervised ranking models can be used to retrieve these few-shot examples from a training set, the effectiveness of the examples can potentially be improved by re-defining the notion of relevance specific to its utility for the downstream task, i.e., considering an example to be relevant if including it in the prompt instruction leads to a correct prediction. With this task-specific notion of relevance, it is possible to train a supervised ranking model (e.g., a bi-encoder or cross-encoder), which potentially learns to optimally select the few-shot examples. We believe that the recent advances in neural rankers can potentially find a use case for this task of optimally choosing examples for more effective downstream ICL predictions.\n\nWith the continuous popularity of deep learning and representation learning, fast vector search becomes a vital task in various ranking/retrieval based applications, say recommendation, ads ranking and question answering. Neural network based ranking is widely adopted due to its powerful capacity in modeling complex relationships, such as between users and items, questions and answers. However, it is usually exploited in offline or re-ranking manners for it is time-consuming in computations. Online neural network ranking--so called fast neural ranking --is considered challenging because neural network measures are usually non-convex and asymmetric. Traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search which usually focuses on metric ranking measures, is not applicable to these advanced measures.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel graph searching framework to accelerate the searching in the fast neural ranking problem. The proposed graph searching algorithm is bi-level: we first construct a probable candidate set; then we only evaluate the neural network measure over the probable candidate set instead of evaluating the neural network over all neighbors. Specifically, we propose a gradient-based algorithm that approximates the rank of the neural network matching score to construct the probable candidate set; and we present an angle-based heuristic procedure to adaptively identify the proper size of the probable candidate set. Empirical results on public data confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms\n\nWith the application of generation models, internet is increasingly inundated with AI-generated content (AIGC), causing both real and AI-generated content indexed in corpus for search. This paper explores the impact of AI-generated images on text-image search in this scenario. Firstly, we construct a benchmark consisting of both real and AI-generated images for this study. In this benchmark, AI-generated images possess visual semantics sufficiently similar to real images. Experiments on this benchmark reveal that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant semantics to the queries than real images. We call this bias as invisible relevance bias. This bias is detected across retrieval models with different training data and architectures. Further exploration reveals that mixing AI-generated images into the training data of retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. These problems cause a vicious cycle in which AI-generated images have a higher chance of exposing from massive data, which makes them more likely to be mixed into the training of retrieval models and such training makes the invisible relevance bias more and more serious. To mitigate this bias and elucidate the potential causes of the bias, firstly, we propose an effective method to alleviate this bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of this bias, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information makes the retriever estimate a higher relevance score. We conduct experiments to support this assertion.\n\nFindings in this paper reveal the potential impact of AI-generated images on retrieval and have implications for further research. Code is released at https://github.com/xsc1234/Invisible-Relevance-Bias.\n\nRank-Biased Overlap (RBO) is a similarity measure for indefinite rankings: it is top-weighted, and can be computed when only a prefix of the rankings is known or when they have only some items in common. It is widely used for instance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing the rankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries. In these situations, though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score. Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete, in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixes only. In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different from the one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably found in rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. In this paper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks to which we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefix evaluation. We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with the ones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference ranking to compare to, and one when there is not. Overall, these three variants provide researchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearly determining what ties mean, and how they should be treated. Finally, using both synthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBO measures. We show that the scores may differ substantially from the original tie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrary criteria such as by document ID. Overall, these results evidence the need for a proper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO.\n\nRelevance and fairness are two major objectives of recommender systems (RSs). Recent work proposes measures of RS fairness that are either independent from relevance (fairness-only) or conditioned on relevance (joint measures). While fairness-only measures have been studied extensively, we look into whether joint measures can be trusted. We collect all joint evaluation measures of RS relevance and fairness, and ask: How much do they agree with each other? To what extent do they agree with relevance/fairness measures? How sensitive are they to changes in rank position, or to increasingly fair and relevant recommendations? We eempirically study for the first time the behaviour of these measures across 4 real-world datasets and 4 recommenders. We find that most of these measures: i) correlate weakly with one another and even contradict each other at times; ii) are less sensitive to rank position changes than relevance- and fairness-only measures, meaning that they are less granular than traditional RS measures; and iii) tend to compress scores at the low end of their range, meaning that they are not very expressive. We counter the above limitations with a set of guidelines on the appropriate usage of such measures, i.e., they should be used with caution due to their tendency to contradict each other and of having a very small empirical range.\n\nInformation retrieval (IR) has a large literature on evaluation, dating back decades and forming a central part of the research culture. The largest proportion of this literature discusses techniques to turn a sequence of relevance labels into a single number, reflecting the system's performance: precision or cumulative gain, for example, or dozens of alternatives. Those techniques-metrics-are themselves evaluated, commonly by reference to sensitivity and validity.\n\nIn our experience measuring search in industrial settings, a measurement regime needs many other qualities to be practical. For example, we must also consider how much a metric costs; how robust it is to the happenstance of sampling; whether it is debuggable; and what activities are incentivised when a metric is taken as a goal.\n\nIn this perspective paper we discuss what makes a search metric successful in large-scale settings, including factors which are not often canvassed in IR research but which are important in \"real-world\" use. We illustrate this with examples, including from industrial settings, and offer suggestions for metrics as part of a working system.\n\nInformation Retrieval (IR) research is deeply rooted in experimentation and evaluation, and the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) has been playing a central role in making that possible since its inauguration in 1992. TREC's mission centers around providing the infrastructure and resources to make IR evaluations possible at scale. Over the years, a plethora of different retrieval problems were addressed, culminating in data artifacts that remained as valuable and useful tools for the IR community. Even though the data are largely available from TREC's website, there is currently no resource that facilitates a cohesive way to obtain metadata information about the run file - the IR community's de-facto standard data format for storing rankings of system-oriented IR experiments.\n\nTo this end, the work at hand introduces a software suite that facilitates access to metadata of experimental resources, resulting from over 30 years of IR experiments and evaluations at TREC. With a particular focus on the run files, the paper motivates the requirements for better access to TREC metadata and details the concepts, the resources, the corresponding implementations, and possible use cases. More specifically, we contribute a web interface to browse former TREC submissions. Besides, we provide the underlying metadatabase and a corresponding RESTful interface for more principled and structured queries about the TREC metadata.\n\nLeveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation. However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application. To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data. We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning. While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.\n\nTo tackle these issues, we introduce two primary objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process. To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method incorporating two scores, namely influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of removing each sample on the overall performance. To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we employ a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score. Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs. We instantiate the proposed method on two competitive LLM-based recommender models, and empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, our method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.\n\nRecently, generative retrieval has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional retrieval paradigms. It assigns each document a unique identifier, known as the DocID, and employs a generative model to directly generate the relevant DocID for the input query. A common choice for the DocID is one or several natural language sequences, e.g. the title, synthetic queries, or n-grams, so that the pre-trained knowledge of the generative model can be effectively utilized. However, a sequence is generated token by token, where only the most likely candidates are kept and the rest are pruned at each decoding step, thus, retrieval fails if any token within the relevant DocID is falsely pruned. What's worse, during decoding, the model can only perceive preceding tokens in the DocID while being blind to subsequent ones, hence is prone to make such errors. To address this problem, we present a novel framework for generative retrieval, dubbed Term-Set Generation (TSGen). Instead of sequences, we use a set of terms as the DocID. The terms are selected based on learned weights from relevance signals, so that they concisely summarize the document's semantics and distinguish it from others. On top of the term-set DocID, we propose a permutation-invariant decoding algorithm, with which the term set can be generated in any permutation yet will always lead to the corresponding document. Remarkably, TSGen perceives all valid terms rather than only the preceding ones at each decoding step. Given the constant decoding space, it can make more reliable decisions due to the broader perspective. TSGen is also resilient to errors: the relevant DocID will not be falsely pruned as long as the decoded term belongs to it. Moreover, TSGen can explore the optimal decoding permutation of the term set on its own, which further improves the likelihood of generating the relevant DocID. Lastly, we design an iterative optimization procedure to incentivize the model to generate the relevant term set in its favorable permutation. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of generative retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, the generalizability, the scalability, and the efficiency of TSGen.\n\nReciprocal Recommender Systems (RRSs) which aim to satisfy the preferences of both service providers and seekers simultaneously has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Existing studies on RRSs mainly focus on modeling the bilateral interactions between the users on both sides to capture the user preferences. However, due to the presence of exposure bias, modeling user preferences solely based on bilateral interactions often lacks precision. Additionally, in RRSs, users may exhibit varying preferences when acting in different roles, and how to effectively model users from multiple perspectives remains a substantial problem. To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel MultI-view Reciprocal Recommender system for Online Recruitment (MIRROR). Specifically, we first propose to model the users from three different views, respectively search, active, and passive views, and we further design several Transformer-based sequential models to capture the user representation corresponding to each view. Then, we propose to divide the bilateral matching process into three stages, respectively apply, reply, and match, and a multi-stage output layer is designed based on the above multi-view modeling results. To train our MIRROR model, we first design a multi-task learning loss based on the multi-stage output results. Moreover, to bridge the semantic gap between search queries and user behaviors, we additionally design a supplementary task for next-query prediction. Finally, we conduct both offline experiments on five real-world datasets and online A/B tests, and the experiment results clearly validate the effectiveness of our MIRROR model compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods.\n\nDigital news platforms use news recommenders as the main instrument to cater to the individual information needs of readers. Despite an increasingly language-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in multiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major, resource-rich languages. Moreover, nearly all news recommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and more users tend to consume information in at least two languages. Accordingly, the existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of publicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of news recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource languages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual news recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine translation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse languages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, we systematically benchmark several content-based neural news recommenders (NNRs) in zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual news consumption patterns. Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when based on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance losses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT training has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news consumption. Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in multilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation. We release xMIND at https://github.com/andreeaiana/xMIND.\n\nMultimedia-based recommendation provides personalized item suggestions by learning the content preferences of users. With the proliferation of digital devices and APPs, a huge number of new items are created rapidly over time. How to quickly provide recommendations for new items at the inference time is challenging. What's worse, real-world items exhibit varying degrees of modality missing(e.g., many short videos are uploaded without text descriptions). Though many efforts have been devoted to multimedia-based recommendations, they either could not deal with new multimedia items or assumed the modality completeness in the modeling process.\n\nIn this paper, we highlight the necessity of tackling the modality missing issue for new item recommendation. We argue that users' inherent content preference is stable and better kept invariant to arbitrary modality missing environments. Therefore, we approach this problem from a novel perspective of invariant learning. However, how to construct environments from finite user behavior training data to generalize any modality missing is challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multimodality Invariant Learning reCommendation (a.k.a. MILK) framework. Specifically, MILK first designs a cross-modality alignment module to keep semantic consistency from pretrained multimedia item features. After that, MILK designs multi-modal heterogeneous environments with cyclic mixup to augment training data, in order to mimic any modality missing for invariant user preference learning.Extensive experiments on three real datasets verify the superiority of our proposed framework.The code is available at https://github.com/HaoyueBai98/MILK.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.\n\nVision-language pre-trained (VLP) models have been the foundation of numerous vision-language tasks. Given their prevalence, it becomes imperative to assess their adversarial robustness, especially when deploying them in security-crucial real-world applications. Traditionally, adversarial perturbations generated for this assessment target specific VLP models, datasets, and/or downstream tasks. This practice suffers from low transferability and additional computation costs when transitioning to new scenarios.\n\nIn this work, we thoroughly investigate whether VLP models are commonly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations of a specific pattern for the image modality. To this end, we propose a novel black-box method to generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which is so called the <u>E</u>ffective and <u>T</u>ransferable <u>U</u>niversal Adversarial Attack (ETU), aiming to mislead a variety of existing VLP models in a range of downstream tasks. The ETU comprehensively takes into account the characteristics of UAPs and the intrinsic cross-modal interactions to generate effective UAPs. Under this regime, the ETU encourages both global and local utilities of UAPs. This benefits the overall utility while reducing interactions between UAP units, improving the transferability. To further enhance the effectiveness and transferability of UAPs, we also design a novel data augmentation method named ScMix. ScMix consists of self-mix and cross-mix data transformations, which can effectively increase the multi-modal data diversity while preserving the semantics of the original data. Through comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve effective and transferrable universal adversarial attacks.\n\nNext basket recommendation ( NBR) is a special type of sequential recommendation that is increasingly receiving attention. So far, most NBR studies have focused on optimizing the accuracy of the recommendation, whereas optimizing for beyond-accuracy metrics, e.g., item fairness and diversity remains largely unexplored. Recent studies into NBR have found a substantial performance difference between recommending repeat items and explore items. Repeat items contribute most of the users' perceived accuracy compared with explore items.\n\nInformed by these findings, we identify a potential \"short-cut\" to optimize for beyond-accuracy metrics while maintaining high accuracy. To leverage and verify the existence of such short-cuts, we propose a plug-and-play two-step repetition-exploration (TREx) framework that treats repeat items and explores items separately, where we design a simple yet highly effective repetition module to ensure high accuracy, while two exploration modules target optimizing only beyond-accuracy metrics.\n\nExperiments are performed on two widely-used datasets w.r.t. a range of beyond-accuracy metrics, viz. five fairness metrics and three diversity metrics. Our experimental results show that: (i) we can achieve state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. accuracy via the designed repetition module in TREx; and (ii) the simple TREx framework achieves \"better\" beyond-accuracy performance than existing sophisticated methods. Prima facie, this appears to be good news: we can achieve high accuracy and improved beyond-accuracy metrics at the same time. However, we argue that the real-world value of our algorithmic solution, TREx, is likely to be limited and reflect on the reasonableness of the evaluation setup. We end up challenging existing evaluation paradigms, particularly in the context of beyond-accuracy metrics, and provide insights for researchers to navigate potential pitfalls and determine reasonable metrics to consider when optimizing for accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics.\n\nRecommender systems filter out information that meets user interests. However, users may be tired of the recommendations that are too similar to the content they have been exposed to in a short historical period, which is the so-called user fatigue. Despite the significance for a better user experience, user fatigue is seldom explored by existing recommenders. In fact, there are three main challenges to be addressed for modeling user fatigue, including what features support it, how it influences user interests, and how its explicit signals are obtained. In this paper, we propose to model user Fatigue in interest learning for sequential Recommendations (FRec). To address the first challenge, based on a multi-interest framework, we connect the target item with historical items and construct an interest-aware similarity matrix as features to support fatigue modeling. Regarding the second challenge, built upon feature cross, we propose a fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion to capture long-term interest. In addition, we develop a fatigue-gated recurrent unit for short-term interest learning, with temporal fatigue representations as important inputs for constructing update and reset gates. For the last challenge, we propose a novel sequence augmentation to obtain explicit fatigue signals for contrastive learning. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including two public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset. Experimental results show that FRec can improve AUC and GAUC up to 0.026 and 0.019 compared with state-of-the-art models, respectively. Moreover, large-scale online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FRec for fatigue reduction. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SIGIR24-FRec.\n\nGPT-4 demonstrates high accuracy in medical QA tasks, leading with an accuracy of 86.70%, followed by Med-PaLM 2 at 86.50%. However, around 14% of errors remain. Additionally, current works use GPT-4 to only predict the correct option without providing any explanation and thus do not provide any insight into the thinking process and reasoning used by GPT-4 or other LLMs. Therefore, we introduce a new domain-specific error taxonomy derived from collaboration with medical students. Our GPT-4 USMLE Error (G4UE) dataset comprises 4153 GPT-4 correct responses and 919 incorrect responses to the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) respectively. These responses are quite long (258 words on average), containing detailed explanations from GPT-4 justifying the selected option. We then launch a large-scale annotation study using the Potato annotation platform and recruit 44 medical experts through Prolific, a well-known crowdsourcing platform. We annotated 300 out of these 919 incorrect data points at a granular level for different classes and created a multi-label span to identify the reasons behind the error. In our annotated dataset, a substantial portion of GPT-4's incorrect responses is categorized as a \"Reasonable response by GPT-4,\" by annotators. This sheds light on the challenge of discerning explanations that may lead to incorrect options, even among trained medical professionals. We also provide medical concepts and medical semantic predications extracted using the SemRep tool for every data point. We believe that it will aid in evaluating the ability of LLMs to answer complex medical questions. We make the resources available at https://github.com/roysoumya/usmle-gpt4-error-taxonomy.\n\nTable search aims to answer a query with a ranked list of tables. Unfortunately, current test corpora have focused mostly on needle-in-the-haystack tasks, where only a few tables are expected to exactly match the query intent. Instead, table search tasks often arise in response to the need for retrieving new datasets or augmenting existing ones, e.g., for data augmentation within data science or machine learning pipelines. Existing table repositories and benchmarks are limited in their ability to test retrieval methods for table search tasks. Thus, to close this gap, we introduce a novel dataset for query-by-example Semantic Table Search. This novel dataset consists of two snapshots of the large-scale Wikipedia tables collection from 2013 and 2019 with two important additions: (1) a page and topic aware ground truth relevance judgment and (2) a large-scale DBpedia entity linking annotation. Moreover, we generate a novel set of entity-centric queries that allows testing existing methods under a novel search scenario: semantic exploratory search. The resulting resource consists of 9,296 novel queries, 610,553 query-table relevance annotations, and 238,038 entity-linked tables from the 2013 snapshot. Similarly, on the 2019 snapshot, the resource consists of 2,560 queries, 958,214 relevance annotations, and 457,714 total tables. This makes our resource the largest annotated table-search corpus to date (97 times more queries and 956 times more annotated tables than any existing benchmark). We perform a user study among domain experts and prove that these annotators agree with the automatically generated relevance annotations. As a result, we can re-evaluate some basic assumptions behind existing table search approaches identifying their shortcomings along with promising novel research directions.\n\nE-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several organic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view request. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes, directly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may result in suboptimal outcomes.\n\nTherefore, this paper proposes a deep automated mechanism that integrates ad auction and allocation, ensuring both IC and Individual Rationality (IR) in the presence of externalities while maximizing revenue and GMV. The mechanism takes candidate ads and the ordered list of organic items as input. For each candidate ad, several candidate allocations are generated by inserting the ad in different positions of the ordered list of organic items. For each candidate allocation, a list-wise model takes the entire allocation as input and outputs the predicted result for each ad and organic item to model the global externalities. Finally, an automated auction mechanism, modeled by deep neural networks, is executed to select the optimal allocation. Consequently, this mechanism simultaneously decides the ranking, payment, and display position of the ad. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism results in higher revenue and GMV than state-of-the-art baselines in offline experiments and online A/B tests.\n\nClick-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a crucial role in recommendation systems, with significant impact on user experience and platform revenue generation. Despite the various public CTR datasets available due to increasing interest from both academia and industry, these datasets have limitations. They cover a limited range of scenarios and predominantly focus on ID-based features, neglecting the vital role of multi-modal features for effective multi-scenario CTR prediction. Moreover, their scale is modest compared to real-world industrial datasets, hindering robust and comprehensive evaluation of complex models. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale <u>M</u>ulti-Scenario <u>M</u>ulti-Modal <u>C</u>TR dataset named AntM2 C, built from real industrial data from Alipay. This dataset offers an impressive breadth and depth of information, covering CTR data from four diverse business scenarios, including advertisements, consumer coupons, mini-programs, and videos. Unlike existing datasets, AntM2 C provides not only ID-based features but also five textual features and one image feature for both users and items, supporting more delicate multi-modal CTR prediction. AntM2 C is also substantially larger than existing datasets, comprising 100 million CTR data. This scale allows for robust and comprehensive evaluation and comparison of CTR prediction models. We employ AntM2 C to construct several typical CTR tasks, including multi-scenario modeling, item and user cold-start modeling, and multi-modal modeling. Initial experiments and comparisons with baseline methods have shown that AntM2 C presents both new challenges and opportunities for CTR models, with the potential to significantly advance CTR research. The AntM2 C dataset is available at https://www.atecup.cn/OfficalDataSet.\n\nCollaborative filtering methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed significant success in recommender systems (RS), capitalizing on their ability to capture collaborative signals within intricate user-item relationships via message-passing mechanisms. However, these GNN-based RS inadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and item embeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations. While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothing problem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of the over-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representations and subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlation issue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact of over-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is a significant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address the aforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlation issue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empirical evidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in these models. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes a pivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the <u>A</u>daptive <u>F</u>eature <u>De</u>-correlation <u>G</u>raph <u>C</u>ollaborative <u>F</u>iltering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically applies correlation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix, effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. The efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filtering models across four publicly available datasets. Our results show the superiority of AFDGCF in enhancing the performance landscape of graph collaborative filtering models.\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are currently one of the most performant and versatile collaborative filtering methods. Meanwhile, like in traditional collaborative filtering, owing to the use of an embedding table to represent each user/item entity as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommenders have inherited its long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a common practice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewer embedding vectors (which we term meta-embeddings), where each entity is represented by a unique combination of meta-embeddings instead. When assigning meta-embeddings, most existing methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each user/item entity's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes (e.g., double hashing), thus simplifying the optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, in the context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omits the semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-item interaction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To this end, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering (LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-based recommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an additional learnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these two heavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings by minimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignment update by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding its closed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse. The meta-embeddings and assignment matrix are alternately updated, where the latter is sparsified on the fly to ensure negligible storage overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have verified LEGCF's smallest trade-off between size and performance, with consistent accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. The codebase of LEGCF is available in https://github.com/xurong-liang/LEGCF.\n\nIn this paper we present Large Language Model Assisted Retrieval Model Ranking (LARMOR), an effective unsupervised approach that leverages LLMs for selecting which dense retriever to use on a test corpus (target). Dense retriever selection is crucial for many IR applications that rely on using dense retrievers trained on public corpora to encode or search a new, private target corpus. This is because when confronted with domain shift, where the downstream corpora, domains, or tasks of the target corpus differ from the domain/task the dense retriever was trained on, its performance often drops. Furthermore, when the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g., in a zero-shot scenario, the direct evaluation of the model on the target corpus becomes unfeasible. Unsupervised selection of the most effective pre-trained dense retriever becomes then a crucial challenge. Current methods for dense retriever selection are insufficient in handling scenarios with domain shift.\n\nOur proposed solution leverages LLMs to generate pseudo-relevant queries, labels and reference lists based on a set of documents sampled from the target corpus. Dense retrievers are then ranked based on their effectiveness on these generated pseudo-relevant signals. Notably, our method is the first approach that relies solely on the target corpus, eliminating the need for both training corpora and test labels. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a large pool of state-of-the-art dense retrievers. The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines with respect to both dense retriever selection and ranking. We make our code and results publicly available at https://github.com/ielab/larmor/.\n\nRecent advances in Information Retrieval have shown the effectiveness of embedding queries and documents in a latent high-dimensional space to compute their similarity. While operating on such high-dimensional spaces is effective, in this paper, we hypothesize that we can improve the retrieval performance by adequately moving to a query-dependent subspace. More in detail, we formulate the Manifold Clustering (MC) Hypothesis: projecting queries and documents onto a subspace of the original representation space can improve retrieval effectiveness. To empirically validate our hypothesis, we define a novel class of Dimension IMportance Estimators (DIME). Such models aim to determine how much each dimension of a high-dimensional representation contributes to the quality of the final ranking and provide an empirical method to select a subset of dimensions where to project the query and the documents. To support our hypothesis, we propose an oracle DIME, capable of effectively selecting dimensions and almost doubling the retrieval performance. To show the practical applicability of our approach, we then propose a set of DIMEs that do not require any oracular piece of information to estimate the importance of dimensions. These estimators allow us to carry out a dimensionality selection that enables performance improvements of up to +11.5% (moving from 0.675 to 0.752 nDCG@10) compared to the baseline methods using all dimensions. Finally, we show that, with simple and realistic active feedback, such as the user's interaction with a single relevant document, we can design a highly effective DIME, allowing us to outperform the baseline by up to +0.224 nDCG@10 points (+58.6%, moving from 0.384 to 0.608).\n\nAutomated Essay Scoring automates the grading process of essays, providing a great advantage for improving the writing proficiency of students. While holistic essay scoring research is prevalent, a noticeable gap exists in scoring essays for specific quality traits. In this work, we focus on the relevance trait, which measures the ability of the student to stay on-topic throughout the entire essay. We propose a novel approach for graded relevance scoring of written essays that employs dense retrieval encoders. Dense representations of essays at different relevance levels then form clusters in the embeddings space, such that their centroids are potentially separate enough to effectively represent their relevance levels. We hence use the simple 1-Nearest-Neighbor classification over those centroids to determine the relevance level of an unseen essay. As an effective unsupervised dense encoder, we leverage Contriever, which is pre-trained with contrastive learning and demonstrated comparable performance to supervised dense retrieval models. We tested our approach on both task-specific (i.e., training and testing on same task) and cross-task (i.e., testing on unseen task) scenarios using the widely used ASAP++ dataset. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in the task-specific scenario, while its extension for the cross-task scenario exhibited a performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art model for that scenario. We also analyzed the performance of our approach in a more practical few-shot scenario, showing that it can significantly reduce the labeling cost while sacrificing only 10% of its effectiveness.\n\nThe zero-shot effectiveness of neural retrieval models is often evaluated on the BEIR benchmark---a combination of different IR evaluation datasets. Interestingly, previous studies found that particularly on the BEIR~subset Touché 2020, an argument retrieval task, neural retrieval models are considerably less effective than BM25. Still, so far, no further investigation has been conducted on what makes argument retrieval so \"special''. To more deeply analyze the respective potential limits of neural retrieval models, we run a reproducibility study on the Touché 2020 data. In our study, we focus on two experiments: (i) a black-box evaluation (i.e., no model retraining), incorporating a theoretical exploration using retrieval axioms, and (ii) a data denoising evaluation involving post-hoc relevance judgments. Our black-box evaluation reveals an inherent bias of neural models towards retrieving short passages from the Touché 2020 data, and we also find that quite a few of the neural models' results are unjudged in the Touché 2020 data. As many of the short Touché passages are not argumentative and thus non-relevant per se, and as the missing judgments complicate fair comparison, we denoise the Touché 2020 data by excluding very short passages (less than 20 words) and by augmenting the unjudged data with post-hoc judgments following the Touché guidelines. On the denoised data, the effectiveness of the neural models improves by up to 0.52 in nDCG@10, but BM25 is still more effective. Our code and the augmented Touché 2020 dataset are available at https://github.com/castorini/touche-error-analysis.\n\nIn the first stage of a re-ranking pipeline, an inexpensive ranking model is typically deployed to retrieve a set of documents that are highly likely to be relevant to the user's query. The retrieved documents are then re-ranked by a more effective but expensive ranking model, e.g., a deep neural ranker such as BERT. However, in such a standard pipeline, no new documents are typically discovered after the first stage retrieval. Hence, the amount of exposure that a particular group of documents - e.g., documents from a particular demographic category - can receive is limited by the number of documents that are retrieved in the first stage retrieval. Indeed, if too few documents from a group are retrieved in the first stage retrieval, ensuring that the group receives a fair amount of exposure to the user may become infeasible. Therefore, it is useful to identify more documents from underrepresented groups that are potentially relevant to the query during the re-ranking stage. In this work, we investigate how deploying adaptive re-ranking, which enables the discovery of additional potentially relevant documents in the re-ranking stage, can improve the exposure that a given group of documents receives in the final ranking. We propose six adaptive re-ranking policies that can discover documents from underrepresented groups to increase the disadvantaged groups' exposure in the final ranking. Our experiments on the TREC 2021 and 2022 Fair Ranking Track test collections show that our policies consistently improve the fairness of the exposure distribution in the final ranking, compared to standard adaptive re-ranking approaches, resulting in increases of up to ~13% in Attention Weighted Ranked Fairness (AWRF). Moreover, our best performing policy, Policy 6, consistently maintains and frequently increases the utility of the search results in terms of nDCG.\n\nWhen learning to rank from user interactions, search and recommender systems must address biases in user behavior to provide a high-quality ranking. One type of bias that has recently been studied in the ranking literature is when sensitive attributes, such as gender, have an impact on a user's judgment about an item's utility. For example, in a search for an expertise area, some users may be biased towards clicking on male candidates over female candidates. We call this type of bias group membership bias.\n\nIncreasingly, we seek rankings that are fair to individuals and sensitive groups. Merit-based fairness measures rely on the estimated utility of the items. With group membership bias, the utility of the sensitive groups is underestimated, hence, without correcting for this bias, a supposedly fair ranking is not truly fair. In this paper, first, we analyze the impact of group membership bias on ranking quality as well as merit-based fairness metrics and show that group membership bias can hurt both ranking and fairness. Then, we provide a correction method for group bias that is based on the assumption that the utility score of items in different groups comes from the same distribution. This assumption has two potential issues of sparsity and equality-instead-of-equity; we use an amortized approach to address these. We show that our correction method can consistently compensate for the negative impact of group membership bias on ranking quality and fairness metrics.\n\nThe logs of the use of a search engine provide sufficient data to train a better ranker. However, it is well known that such implicit feedback reflects biases, and in particular a presentation bias that favors higher-ranked results. Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods attempt to optimize performance by jointly modeling this bias along with the ranker so that the bias can be removed. Such methods have been shown to provide theoretical soundness, and promise superior performance and low deployment costs. However, existing ULTR methods don't recognize that query-document relevance is a confounder -- it affects both the likelihood of a result being clicked because of relevance and the likelihood of the result being ranked high by the base ranker. Moreover, the performance guarantees of existing ULTR methods assume the use of a weak ranker -- one that does a poor job of ranking documents based on relevance to a query. In practice, of course, commercial search engines use highly tuned rankers, and desire to improve upon them using the implicit judgments in search logs. This results in a significant correlation between position and relevance, which leads existing ULTR methods to overestimate click propensities in highly ranked results, reducing ULTR's effectiveness. This paper is the first to demonstrate the problem of propensity overestimation by ULTR algorithms, based on a causal analysis. We develop a new learning objective based on a backdoor adjustment. In addition, we introduce the Logging-Policy-aware Propensity (LPP) model that can jointly learn LPP and a more accurate ranker. We extensively test our approach on two public benchmark tasks and show that our proposal is effective, practical and significantly outperforms the state of the art.\n\nModeling user preferences has been mainly addressed by looking at users' interaction history with the different elements available in the system. Tailoring content to individual preferences based on historical data is the main goal of sequential recommendation. The nature of the problem, as well as the good performance observed across various domains, has motivated the use of the transformer architecture, which has proven effective in leveraging increasingly larger amounts of training data when accompanied by an increase in the number of model parameters. This scaling behavior has brought a great deal of attention, as it provides valuable guidance in the design and training of even larger models. Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language models, we explore similar principles for sequential recommendation. Addressing scalability in this context requires special considerations as some particularities of the problem depart from the language modeling case. These particularities originate in the nature of the content catalogs, which are significantly larger than the vocabularies used for language and might change over time. In our case, we start from a well-known transformer-based model from the literature and make two crucial modifications. First, we pivot from the traditional representation of catalog items as trainable embeddings to representations computed with a trainable feature extractor, making the parameter count independent of the number of items in the catalog. Second, we propose a contrastive learning formulation that provides us with a better representation of the catalog diversity. We demonstrate that, under this setting, we can train our models effectively on increasingly larger datasets under a common experimental setup. We use the full Amazon Product Data dataset, which has only been partially explored in other studies, and reveal scaling behaviors similar to those found in language models. Compute-optimal training is possible but requires a careful analysis of the compute-performance trade-offs specific to the application. We also show that performance scaling translates to downstream tasks by fine-tuning larger pre-trained models on smaller task-specific domains. Our approach and findings provide a strategic roadmap for model training and deployment in real high-dimensional preference spaces, facilitating better training and inference efficiency. We hope this paper bridges the gap between the potential of transformers and the intrinsic complexities of high-dimensional sequential recommendation in real-world recommender systems. Code and models can be found at https://github.com/mercadolibre/srt.\n\nTo capture user preference, transformer models have been widely applied to model sequential user behavior data. The core of transformer architecture lies in the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores in a sequence. Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encoding is used to enhance the attention between token representations. In this setting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic difference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model the two kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially limits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling.\n\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention, named EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate both semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involves two key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation function for efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex vectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic and positional information in a complex rotation form. Secondly, it develops a differential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be controlled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the semantic and positional information according to the semantic contexts. Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve the isotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer. Our theoretical framework possesses a high degree of completeness and generality (e.g., RoPE can be instantiated as a special case). It is more robust to semantic variations and possesses more superior theoretical properties (e.g., long-term decay) in principle. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/EulerFormer.\n\nGraph retrieval aims to find the most similar graphs in a graph database given a query graph, which is a fundamental problem with many real-world applications in chemical engineering, code analysis, etc. To date, existing neural graph retrieval methods generally fall into two categories: Embedding Based Paradigm (Ebp) and Matching Based Paradigm (Mbp). The Ebp models learn an individual vectorial representation for each graph and the retrieval process can be accelerated by pre-computing these representations. The Mbp models learn a neural matching function to compare graphs on a pair-by-pair basis, in which the fine-grained pairwise comparison leads to higher retrieval accuracy but severely degrades retrieval efficiency. In this paper, to combine the advantage of Ebp in retrieval efficiency with that of Mbp in retrieval accuracy, we propose a novel Graph RetrievAl framework via KNowledge Distillation, namely GRAND. The key point is to leverage the idea of knowledge distillation to transfer the fine-grained graph comparison knowledge from an Mbp model to an Ebp model, such that the Ebp model can generate better graph representations and thus yield higher retrieval accuracy. At the same time, we can still pre-compute and index the improved graph representations to retain the retrieval speed of Ebp. Towards this end, we propose to perform knowledge distillation from three perspectives: score, node, and subgraph levels. In addition, we propose to perform mutual two-way knowledge transfer between Mbp and Ebp, such that Mbp and Ebp complement and benefit each other. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that GRAND improves the performance of Ebp by a large margin and the improvement is consistent for different combinations of Ebp and Mbp models. For example, GRAND achieves performance gains of mostly more than 10% and up to 16.88% in terms of Recall@K on different datasets.\n\nTo make room for privacy and efficiency, the deployment of many recommender systems is experiencing a shift from central servers to personal devices, where the federated recommender systems (FedRecs) and decentralized collaborative recommender systems (DecRecs) are arguably the two most representative paradigms. While both leverage knowledge (e.g., gradients) sharing to facilitate learning local models, FedRecs rely on a central server to coordinate the optimization process, yet in DecRecs, the knowledge sharing directly happens between clients. On the flip side, knowledge sharing also opens a backdoor for model poisoning attacks, where adversaries disguise themselves as benign clients and disseminate polluted knowledge to achieve malicious goals like promoting an item's exposure rate. Although research on such poisoning attacks provides valuable insights into finding security loopholes and corresponding countermeasures, existing attacks mostly focus on FedRecs, and are either inapplicable or ineffective for DecRecs. Compared with FedRecs where the tampered information can be universally distributed to all clients once uploaded to the cloud, each adversary in DecRecs can only communicate with neighbor clients of a small size, confining its impact to a limited range.\n\nTo fill the gap, we present a novel attack method named Poisoning with Adaptive Malicious Neighbors (PAMN). With item promotion in top-K recommendation as the attack objective, PAMN effectively boosts target items' ranks with several adversaries that emulate benign clients (i.e., users) and transfers adaptively crafted gradients conditioned on each adversary's neighbors. A diversity-driven regularizer is further designed in PAMN to allow the adversaries to reach a broader group of multifaceted benign users. Moreover, with the vulnerabilities of DecRecs uncovered, a dedicated defensive mechanism based on user-level gradient clipping with sparsified updating is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the poisoning attack and the robustness of our defensive mechanism.\n\nIn the realm of personalized recommender systems, the challenge of adapting to evolving user preferences and the continuous influx of new users and items is paramount. Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution, attracting significant attention in academia and industry. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies, which necessitate extensive model expansion and are hampered by time-consuming updates due to large parameter sets. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.\n\nFor a given query generative retrieval generates identifiers of relevant documents in an end-to-end manner using a sequence-to-sequence architecture. The relation between generative retrieval and other retrieval methods, especially those based on matching within dense retrieval models, is not yet fully comprehended. Prior work has demonstrated that generative retrieval with atomic identifiers is equivalent to single-vector dense retrieval. Accordingly, generative retrieval exhibits behavior analogous to hierarchical search within a tree index in dense retrieval when using hierarchical semantic identifiers. However, prior work focuses solely on the retrieval stage without considering the deep interactions within the decoder of generative retrieval.\n\nIn this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that generative retrieval and multi-vector dense retrieval share the same framework for measuring the relevance to a query of a document. Specifically, we examine the attention layer and prediction head of generative retrieval, revealing that generative retrieval can be understood as a special case of multi-vector dense retrieval. Both methods compute relevance as a sum of products of query and document vectors and an alignment matrix. We then explore how generative retrieval applies this framework, employing distinct strategies for computing document token vectors and the alignment matrix. We have conducted experiments to verify our conclusions and show that both paradigms exhibit commonalities of term matching in their alignment matrix.\n\nOur findings apply to many generative retrieval identifier designs and provide possible explanations on how generative retrieval can express query-document relevance. As multi-vector dense retrieval is the state-of-the-art dense retrieval method currently, understanding the connection between generative retrieval and multi-vector dense retrieval is crucial for shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of generative retrieval and for developing, and understanding the potential of, new retrieval models.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new ways to satisfy information needs. Although great strides have been made in applying them to settings like document ranking and short-form text generation, they still struggle to compose complete, accurate, and verifiable long-form reports. Reports with these qualities are necessary to satisfy the complex, nuanced, or multi-faceted information needs of users. In this perspective paper, we draw together opinions from industry and academia, and from a variety of related research areas, to present our vision for automatic report generation, and---critically---a flexible framework by which such reports can be evaluated. In contrast with other summarization tasks, automatic report generation starts with a detailed description of an information need, stating the necessary background, requirements, and scope of the report. Further, the generated reports should be complete, accurate, and verifiable. These qualities, which are desirable---if not required---in many analytic report-writing settings, require rethinking how to build and evaluate systems that exhibit these qualities. To foster new efforts in building these systems, we present an evaluation framework that draws on ideas found in various evaluations. To test completeness and accuracy, the framework uses nuggets of information, expressed as questions and answers, that need to be part of any high-quality generated report. Additionally, evaluation of citations that map claims made in the report to their source documents ensures verifiability.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is considered to be a promising approach to alleviate the hallucination issue of large language models (LLMs), and it has received widespread attention from researchers recently. Due to the limitation in the semantic understanding of retrieval models, the success of RAG heavily lies on the ability of LLMs to identify passages with utility. Recent efforts have explored the ability of LLMs to assess the relevance of passages in retrieval, but there has been limited work on evaluating the utility of passages in supporting question answering.\n\nIn this work, we conduct a comprehensive study about the capabilities of LLMs in utility evaluation for open-domain question answering (QA). Specifically, we introduce a benchmarking procedure and collection of candidate passages with different characteristics, facilitating a series of experiments with five representative LLMs. Our experiments reveal that: (i) well-instructed LLMs can distinguish between relevance and utility, and that LLMs are highly receptive to newly generated counterfactual passages. Moreover, (ii) we scrutinize key factors that affect utility judgments in the instruction design. And finally, (iii) to verify the efficacy of utility judgments in practical retrieval augmentation applications, we delve into LLMs' QA capabilities using the evidence judged with utility and direct dense retrieval results. (iv) We propose a k-sampling, listwise approach to reduce the dependency of LLMs on the sequence of input passages, thereby facilitating subsequent answer generation. We believe that the way we formalize and study the problem along with our findings contributes to a critical assessment of retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our code and benchmark can be found at https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/utility_judgments.\n\nCross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) improves recommendation performance by utilizing information from multiple domains, which contrasts with Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR) that relies on a historical interaction within a specific domain. However, CDSR may underperform compared to the SDSR approach in certain domains due to negative transfer, which occurs when there is a lack of relation between domains or different levels of data sparsity. To address the issue of negative transfer, our proposed CDSR model estimates the degree of negative transfer of each domain and adaptively assigns it as a weight factor to the prediction loss, to control gradient flows through domains with significant negative transfer. To this end, our model compares the performance of a model trained on multiple domains (CDSR) with a model trained solely on the specific domain (SDSR) to evaluate the negative transfer of each domain using our asymmetric cooperative network. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of valuable cues between the SDSR and CDSR tasks, we developed an auxiliary loss that maximizes the mutual information between the representation pairs from both tasks on a per-domain basis. This cooperative learning between SDSR and CDSR tasks is similar to the collaborative dynamics between pacers and runners in a marathon. Our model outperformed numerous previous works in extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets across ten service domains. We also have deployed our model in the recommendation system of our personal assistant app service, resulting in 21.4% increase in click-through rate compared to existing models, which is valuable to real-world business1.\n\nCross-Domain Recommendation~(CDR) seeks to enable effective knowledge transfer across domains. Most existing works rely on either representation alignment or transformation bridges, but they come with shortcomings regarding identifiability of domain-shared and domain-specific latent factors. Specifically, while CDR describes user representations as a joint distribution over two domains, these methods fail to account for its joint identifiability as they primarily fixate on the marginal distribution within a particular domain. Such a failure may overlook the conditionality between two domains and how it contributes to latent factor disentanglement, leading to negative transfer when domains are weakly correlated. In this study, we explore what should and should not be transferred in cross-domain user representations from a causality perspective. We propose a Hierarchical causal subspace disentanglement approach to explore the Joint IDentifiability of cross-domain joint distribution, termed HJID, to preserve domain-specific behaviors from domain-shared factors. HJID abides by the feature hierarchy and divides user representations into generic shallow subspace and domain-oriented deep subspaces. We first encode the generic pattern in the shallow subspace by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy of initial layer activation. Then, to dissect how domain-oriented latent factors are encoded in deeper layers activation, we construct a cross-domain causality-based data generation graph, which identifies cross-domain consistent and domain-specific components, adhering to the Minimal Change principle. This allows HJID to maintain stability whilst discovering unique factors for different domains, all within a generative framework of invertible transformations that guarantee the joint identifiability. With experiments on real-world datasets, we show that HJID outperforms SOTA methods on both strong- and weak-correlation CDR tasks.\n\nComposed image retrieval (CIR) is the task of searching target images using an image-text pair as a query. Given the straightforward relation of query pair-target image, the dominant methods follow the learning paradigm of common image-text retrieval and simply model this problem as the query-target matching problem. Particularly, the common practice first encodes the multi-modal query into one feature and then aligns it with the target image. However, such a learning paradigm only explores the naive relation in the triplets. We argue that CIR triplets encompass additional associations besides the primary query-target relation, which is overlooked in existing works. In this paper, we disclose two new relations residing in the triplets by viewing the triplet as a graph node. In analogy with the graph node, we mine two associations of text-bridged image alignment and complementary text reasoning. The text-bridged image alignment considers composed image retrieval as a specialized form of image retrieval, where the query text acts as a bridge between the query image and the target one, and a hinge-based cross attention is proposed to incorporate this relation into the network learning. On the other hand, the association of complementary text reasoning regards composed image retrieval as a specific type of cross-modal retrieval, where the composite two images are used to reason the complementary text. To integrate these views effectively, a twin attention-based compositor is designed. By combining these two types of complementary associations with the explicit query pair-target image relation, we establish a comprehensive set of constraints for composed image retrieval. With the above designs, we finally developed our CaLa, a Complementary Association Learning framework for Augmenting Composed Image Retrieval. Experimental evaluations are conducted on the widely-used CIRR and FashIionIQ benchmarks with multiple backbones to validate the effectiveness of our CaLa. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in the composed image retrieval task. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Chiangsonw/CaLa\n\nIn case law, the precedents are the relevant cases that are used to support the decisions made by the judges and the opinions of lawyers towards a given case. This relevance is referred to as the case-to-case reference relation. To efficiently find relevant cases from a large case pool, retrieval tools are widely used by legal practitioners. Existing legal case retrieval models mainly work by comparing the text representations of individual cases. Although they obtain a decent retrieval accuracy, the intrinsic case connectivity relationships among cases have not been well exploited for case encoding, therefore limiting the further improvement of retrieval performance. In a case pool, there are three types of case connectivity relationships: the case reference relationship, the case semantic relationship, and the case legal charge relationship. Due to the inductive manner in the task of legal case retrieval, using case reference as input is not applicable for testing. Thus, in this paper, a CaseLink model based on inductive graph learning is proposed to utilise the intrinsic case connectivity for legal case retrieval, a novel Global Case Graph is incorporated to represent both the case semantic relationship and the case legal charge relationship. A novel contrastive objective with a regularisation on the degree of case nodes is proposed to leverage the information carried by the case reference relationship to optimise the model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CaseLink. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/CaseLink.\n\nLegal document retrieval and judgment prediction are crucial tasks in intelligent legal systems. In practice, determining whether two documents share the same judgments is essential for establishing their relevance in legal retrieval. However, existing legal retrieval studies either ignore the vital role of judgment prediction or rely on implicit training objectives, expecting a proper alignment of legal documents in vector space based on their judgments. Neither approach provides explicit evidence of judgment consistency for relevance modeling, leading to inaccuracies and a lack of transparency in retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a law-guided method, namely GEAR, within the generative retrieval framework. GEAR explicitly integrates judgment prediction with legal document retrieval in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Specifically, given the intricate nature of legal documents, we first extract rationales from documents based on the definition of charges in law. We then employ these rationales as queries, ensuring efficiency and producing a shared, informative document representation for both tasks. Second, in accordance with the inherent hierarchy of law, we construct a law structure constraint tree and represent each candidate document as a hierarchical semantic ID based on this tree. This empowers GEAR to perform dual predictions for judgment and relevant documents in a single inference, i.e., traversing the tree from the root through intermediate judgment nodes, to document-specific leaf nodes. Third, we devise the revision loss that jointly minimizes the discrepancy between the IDs of predicted and labeled judgments, as well as retrieved documents, thus improving accuracy and consistency for both tasks. Extensive experiments on two Chinese legal case retrieval datasets show the superiority of GEAR over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive judgment prediction performance. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of GEAR on a French statutory article retrieval dataset, reaffirming its robustness across languages and domains.\n\nText stemming is a natural language processing technique that is used to reduce words to their base form, also known as the root form. In Information Retrieval (IR), stemming is used in keyword-based matching pipelines to normalise text before indexing and query processing to improve subsequent matching between document and query keywords. The use of stemming has been shown to often improve the effectiveness of keyword-matching models such as BM25. However, traditional stemming methods, focusing solely on individual terms, overlook the richness of contextual information.\n\nRecognizing this gap, in this paper, we investigate the promising idea of using large language models (LLMs) to stem words by lever-aging its capability of context understanding. With this respect, we identify three avenues, each characterised by different trade-offs in terms of computational cost, effectiveness and robustness : (1) use LLMs to stem the vocabulary for a collection, i.e., the set of unique words that appear in the collection (vocabulary stemming), (2) use LLMs to stem each document separately (contextual stemming), and (3) use LLMs to extract from each document entities that should not be stemmed, then use vocabulary stemming to stem the rest of the terms (entity-based contextual stemming). Through a series of empirical experiments, we compare the use of LLMs for stemming with that of traditional lexical stemmers such as Porter and Krovetz for English text. We find that while vocabulary stemming and contextual stemming fail to achieve higher effectiveness than traditional stemmers, entity-based contextual stemming can achieve a higher effectiveness than using Porter stemmer alone, under specific conditions.

While many downstream tasks highly rely on the expressive modeling and predictive embedding of KGs, most of the current KG representation learning methods, where each entity is embedded as a vector in the Euclidean space and each relation is embedded as a transformation, follow an entity ranking protocol. On one hand, such an embedding design cannot capture many-to-many relations. On the other hand, in many retrieval cases, the users wish to get an exact set of answers without any ranking, especially when the results are expected to be precise, e.g., which genes cause an illness. Such scenarios are commonly referred to as \"set retrieval\". This work presents a pioneering study on the KG set retrieval problem. We show that the set retrieval highly depends on expressive modeling of many-to-many relations, and propose a new KG embedding model SpherE to address this problem. SpherE is based on rotational embedding methods, but each entity is embedded as a sphere instead of a vector. While inheriting the high interpretability of rotational-based models, our SpherE can more expressively model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our SpherE can well address the set retrieval problem while still having a good predictive ability to infer missing facts. The code is available at https://github.com/Violet24K/SpherE.\n\nCrafting the ideal, job-specific resume is a challenging task for many job applicants, especially for early-career applicants. While it is highly recommended that applicants tailor their resume to the specific role they are applying for, manually tailoring resumes to job descriptions and role-specific requirements is often (1) extremely time-consuming, and (2) prone to human errors. Furthermore, performing such a tailoring step at scale while applying to several roles may result in a lack of quality of the edited resumes. To tackle this problem, in this demo paper, we propose ResumeFlow: a Large Language Model (LLM) aided tool that enables an end user to simply provide their detailed resume and the desired job posting, and obtain a personalized resume specifically tailored to that specific job posting in the matter of a few seconds. Our proposed pipeline leverages the language understanding and information extraction capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini, in order to (1) extract details from a job description, (2) extract role-specific details from the user-provided resume, and then (3) use these to refine and generate a role-specific resume for the user. Our easy-to-use tool leverages the user-chosen LLM in a completely off-the-shelf manner, thus requiring no fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool via a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agl7ugyu1N4 and propose novel task-specific evaluation metrics to control for alignment and hallucination. Our tool is available at https://job-aligned-resume.streamlit.app.\n\nCustomer service is how companies interface with their customers. It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction. However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or \"chat bots\". On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment.\n\nThis raises the bar for customer service agents. They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once.\n\nIn this work, we introduce \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface. AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations---the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually. Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.\n\nProduct attribute value extraction is a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the contemporary e-commerce industry. The provision of precise product attribute values is fundamental in ensuring high-quality recommendations and enhancing customer satisfaction. The recently emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state of-the-art performance in numerous attribute extraction tasks, without the need for domain-specific training data. Nevertheless, varying strengths and weaknesses are exhibited by different LLMs due to the diversity in data, architectures, and hyperparameters. This variation makes them complementary to each other, with no single LLM dominating all others. Considering the diverse strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, it becomes necessary to develop an ensemble method that leverages their complementary potentials.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called LLM-ensemble to ensemble different LLMs' outputs for attribute value extraction. We iteratively learn the weights for different LLMs to aggregate the labels with weights to predict the final attribute value. Not only can our proposed method be proven theoretically optimal, but it also ensures efficient computation, fast convergence, and safe deployment. We have also conducted extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs on Walmart's internal data. Our offline metrics demonstrate that the LLM-ensemble method outperforms all the state-of-the-art single LLMs on Walmart's internal dataset. This method has been launched in several production models, leading to improved Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), and Add-to-Cart Rate (ATC).\n\nFrom undergraduate students to renowned scholars, everyone occasionally encounters unknown concepts within their field of interest, especially when reading scientific articles. ScienceDirectTopic Pages (TP) are intended to facilitate learning and to provide users with a structured overview of sources to deepen their knowledge about such unfamiliar topics. Our free service provides insight into a vast set of technical topics across 20 different scientific domains. Designed to emulate the natural flow of learning, TPs are embedded within millions of articles so that users can click on unfamiliar concepts they come across whilst reading an article. This redirects the user to a TP, consisting of a definition of the concept, which provides the user with a basic understanding of the concept. The TP further presents a collection of relevant snippets extracted from books and review articles published by ScienceDirect for users interested in references and more detailed explanations and applications of the concept. Finally, a set of related topics is provided to extend the user's knowledge even further. To build TPs, we utilize various information retrieval methods across our product. We retrieve the most relevant snippets for each topic/concept using a semantic search model fine-tuned on our scientific database. We further leverage the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate reliable definitions on the topics sourced from ScienceDirect's content. To retrieve a list of relevant concepts for each topic, we use the co-occurrence statistics of concepts within books and articles.\n\nUnderstanding how people interact with search interfaces is core to the field of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). While various models have been proposed (e.g., Belkin's ASK, Berry picking, Everyday-life information seeking, Information foraging theory, Economic theory, etc.), they have largely ignored the impact of cognitive biases on search behaviour and performance. A growing body of empirical work exploring how people's cognitive biases influence search and judgments, has led to the development of new models of search that draw upon Behavioural Economics and Psychology. This full day tutorial will provide a starting point for researchers seeking to learn more about information seeking, search and retrieval under uncertainty. The tutorial will be structured into three parts. First, we will provide an introduction of the biases and heuristics program put forward by Tversky and Kahneman [60] (1974) which assumes that people are not always rational. The second part of the tutorial will provide an overview of the types and space of biases in search,[5, 40] before doing a deep dive into several specific examples and the impact of biases on different types of decisions (e.g., health/medical, financial). The third part will focus on a discussion of the practical implication regarding the design and evaluation human-centered IR systems in the light of cognitive biases - where participants will undertake some hands-on exercises.\n\nInformation retrieval (IR) systems have become an essential component in modern society to help users find useful information, which consists of a series of processes including query expansion, item recall, item ranking and re-ranking, etc. Based on the ranked information list, users can provide their feedbacks. Such an interaction process between users and IR systems can be naturally formulated as a decision-making problem, which can be either one-step or sequential. In the last ten years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a promising direction for decision-making, since DRL utilizes the high model capacity of deep learning for complex decision-making tasks. On the one hand, there have been emerging research works focusing on leveraging DRL for IR tasks. However, the fundamental information theory under DRL settings, the challenge of RL methods for Industrial IR tasks, or the simulations of DRL-based IR systems, has not been deeply investigated. On the other hand, the emerging LLM provides new opportunities for optimizing and simulating IR systems. To this end, we propose the first Agent-based IR workshop at SIGIR 2024, as a continuation from one of the most successful IR workshops, DRL4IR. It provides a venue for both academia researchers and industry practitioners to present the recent advances of both DRL-based IR systems and LLM-based IR systems from the agent-based IR's perspective, to foster novel research, interesting findings, and new applications.\n\nIn recent years, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a pivotal component in the field of artificial intelligence, gaining significant attention and importance across various domains. These systems, which combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, have shown promise in enhancing the capabilities and performance of machine learning applications. However, despite their growing prominence, RAG systems are not without their limitations and continue to be in need of exploration and improvement. This workshop seeks to focus on the critical aspect of information retrieval and its integral role within RAG frameworks. We argue that current efforts have undervalued the role of Information Retrieval (IR) in the RAG and have concentrated their attention on the generative part. As the cornerstone of these systems, IR's effectiveness dramatically influences the overall performance and outcomes of RAG models. We call for papers that will seek to revisit and emphasize the fundamental principles underpinning RAG systems. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding of how robust information retrieval mechanisms can significantly enhance the capabilities of RAG systems. The workshop will serve as a platform for experts, researchers, and practitioners. We intend to foster discussions, share insights, and encourage research that underscores the vital role of Information Retrieval in the future of generative systems.\n\nThe Information Retrieval (IR) community has a rich history of empirically measuring novel retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. However, as the search ecosystem is developing rapidly, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating efficiency in recent years, which raises the question of the cost-benefit ratio between effectiveness and efficiency. In this regard, it has become difficult to compare and contrast systems in an empirically fair way. Factors including hardware configurations, software versioning, experimental settings, and measurement methods all contribute to the difficulty of meaningfully comparing search systems, especially where efficiency is a key component of the evaluation. Furthermore, efficiency is no longer limited to time and space but has found new, challenging dimensions that stretch to resource, sample, and energy efficiency and have implications for users, researchers, and the environment. Examining algorithms and models through the lens of efficiency and its trade-off with effectiveness requires revisiting and establishing new standards and principles, from defining relevant concepts, to designing measures, to creating guidelines for making sense of the significance of findings. The third iteration of ReNeuIR aims to bring the community together to debate these questions and collaboratively test and improve a benchmarking framework for efficiency derived from the discussions of the first two iterations of this workshop. We provide a first prototype of this framework by organizing a shared task track focused on comparability and reproducibility at the workshop.\n\nWeb search services are widely employed for various purposes. After identifying information needs, users attempt to articulate them in web queries that express their intentions. Then, they submit these queries to the chosen search engine with the hope of obtaining relevant results to meet their needs. In some cases, users may not immediately find precisely what they are seeking, prompting them to rewrite the query to obtain a greater number of relevant results or results that are perhaps more related to their intent. While significant work has been done on developing features such as query auto-completion, query suggestion, and query recommendation, the majority of these efforts were based on query co-occurrence or query similarity by clustering them or constructing query flow graphs to capture query connections. These approaches operate under the assumption that frequently observed follow-up queries are more likely to be submitted by users [1, 2, 4].\n\nIn this research, we investigate user query reformulation behavior. To achieve this, we will utilize the Trip Click dataset, a large-scale collection of user click data within the context of a health web search engine [3]. The log data from 2018 to 2020 will be considered, comprising 1,803,493 records representing the clicks that occurred across 527,749 sessions. Specifically, the focus will be on the impact of user interactions with the search result page when forming subsequent queries.\n\nPre-trained language models based on the transformer architecture provide solutions to general ad-hoc search tasks--ranging from news search to question-answering--vastly outperforming statistical approaches in terms of both precision and recall. These models operate over \"semantics'', removing the need for bespoke features based on proprietary data (e.g., interaction logs). In doing so, this paradigm may lead to further adoption of the idealised \"end-to-end'' retrieval system as an elegant and powerful search solution. However, outside of sanitised benchmarks, these models present exploitable and untrustworthy biases relinquishing any control over inference due to their black-box nature.\n\nSuch biases threaten the viability of neural models in production. Without greater control over model output, stakeholders could raise concerns hindering the adoption of effective and efficient search. Today, feature-based search systems are still performant relative to state-of-the-art neural search and can adapt to a changing corpus and the needs of system stakeholders. As agency over information access is further reduced via emerging paradigms such as Retrieval-Augmented-Generation, we must retain control over the output of a search system. We consider that bias in neural search systems is an artefact of the training and underlying mechanisms of current pre-trained models but is not present in statistical models. Features such as statistical models are principled and arbitrarily controllable; these features can adapt to a corpus and meet the demands of a given search task. Conversely, the output of a current neural system can only be changed by post hoc constraints or by re-training the underlying model. We posit that by allowing external features to influence the semantic interactions within neural search at inference time, we can not only allow control over system output but reduce the need to model corpus-specific priors, which can instead be modelled by external features, allowing for greater generalisation and training efficiency gains. We aim to reduce the complexity of neural ranker training and inference, applying classical IR principles and systems that align with such principles as a generalisable process as opposed to the ad-hoc constraint of prior work. Such an approach can reduce the need for larger models whilst improving generalisation. Axiomatic signals can guide and control neural ranking models to reduce spurious factors in semantic relevance estimation by compensating for the frozen priors of neural systems whilst still operating over flexible latent space. Given the biases observed in current systems, this may satiate the concerns of multiple stakeholders, leading to broader adoption of the paradigm.\n\nThe advent of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the human-AI interaction and information-seeking process. Leveraging LLMs as an alternative to search engines, users can now access summarized information tailored to their queries, significantly reducing the cognitive load in navigating vast information resources. This shift underscores the potential of LLMs in redefining information access paradigms [1]. Drawing on the foundation of task-focused information retrieval and LLMs' task planning ability, this research extends the scope of LLM capabilities beyond short-term task automation (i.e., smaller-scale and routine tasks that LLM agents can automate with less human intervention) to support users in navigating long-term and significant life tasks. The long-term tasks encompass broader personal life goals or development in aspects like health, finances, education, and professional development, which cannot be fully completed by LLM agents but require significant human involvement.\n\nThis study introduces the GOLF framework (Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks), which focuses on enhancing LLMs' ability to assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long-term planning. Figure 1 presents the GOLF framework, including a task taxonomy and the process for task management. The GOLF framework envisions the completion of complex tasks as a strategic journey toward a final goal, incorporating a sequence of activities, tasks, and subtasks, adopting the task taxonomy in Figure 1a [2]. Figure 1b illustrates the task process within the GOLF framework, which operates on AutoGen [3], a sophisticated multi-agent system, and involves multiple LLM agents to facilitate user support and workload distribution for achieving long-term goals. The multi-agent system processes the task following steps: Initial Planning, Step Planning, Task Assignment, Multi-Agent Coordination, User Engagement, and Evaluation and Iteration.\n\nThe methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test the framework's efficacy, followed by model and human evaluations to develop a dataset benchmark for long-term life tasks, and experiments across different models and settings. By shifting the focus from short-term tasks to the broader spectrum of long-term life goals, this research underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing human decision-making processes and task management, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of human-AI collaboration.\n\nRapid adoption of a new generation of LLMs has demonstrated their considerable capabilities. However, these models are far from infallible, raising significant ethical concerns, especially in decision-making applications, prompting calls for increased restraint [2].\n\nThe Augmented Intelligence paradigm is one proposed mitigation. Therein LLMs are tools used by human decision makers to improve performance without corresponding loss of accountability.\n\nHowever, this mitigation imposes requirements on models that are not the primary focus of existing evaluation approaches.
