        "text": "Ron Johnson (born April 8, 1955, Mankato, Minnesota, U.S.) is an American businessman and politician who was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2010 and began representing Wisconsin the following year.\n\nJohnson was born and raised in Mankato, Minnesota. He gained early admission to the University of Minnesota, from which he received a bachelor’s degree in accounting in 1977. That year he also married, and he and his wife, Jane, later had three children. He began a master’s program in business administration but left to move to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he and his brother-in-law started a business manufacturing plastic sheeting for packaging. When the company was sold in the mid-1980s, Johnson remained as chief executive officer. He reacquired the firm a decade later.\n\nJohnson entered politics with a run for the U.S. Senate in 2010, having had no previous experience with elected office. Speaking against federal overreach and the government’s economic stimulus programs at a Tea Party rally that year, he found a receptive audience and a state Republican Party machine that was supportive of his campaign. He was elected to the Senate with nearly 52 percent of the vote.\n\nAfter taking office in 2011, Johnson voted in ways that reflected his conservative views. He introduced legislation to reinforce programs of the Department of Homeland Security and to require a comprehensive accounting of U.S. contributions to the United Nations. He also repeatedly sponsored bills meant to undermine the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; 2010). In 2014 Johnson filed a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that, among other things, the PPACA granted to him, as a member of Congress, certain benefits that harmed his reputation, since he enjoyed health insurance privileges not available to his constituency. A federal appeals court rejected the suit in 2015.\n\nIn 2016 Johnson won a second term in the Senate. That year he also supported the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, though he stopped short of endorsing him. However, after Trump won, Johnson became an increasingly vocal defender of the president. He opposed the investigation into whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, and he was highly critical of the U.S. House of Representatives for having impeached Trump in 2019. The latter event concerned allegations that the president had withheld aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden (in 2020 Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee). Johnson, a supporter of Ukraine, had reportedly been a witness to various incidents being scrutinized, and he denied any wrongdoing on his part or the president’s. In February 2020 Trump was acquitted in the Senate in a largely party-line vote. Johnson later led a Senate investigation into possible corruption by Biden and his son Hunter, but it found no misconduct. During this time the United States struggled amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and Johnson became known for spreading false information about the disease. In 2021 he notably claimed that using mouthwash could kill the virus.\n\nAfter Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Johnson alleged that voting fraud had occurred, despite a lack of evidence. In December he held a Senate committee hearing to discuss the claims. On January 6, 2021, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by Trump supporters as Congress convened to certify the election results. The proceedings were temporarily halted, but Biden was ultimately certified as the winner. The House of Representatives impeached Trump, charging him with inciting the bloody assault. In the Senate trial, Johnson voted not to convict, and Trump was ultimately acquitted. Johnson later declared that “by and large it was a peaceful protest.”"
