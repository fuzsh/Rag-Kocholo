        "text": "On April 2, 2023, the patriarch of our family, Ronald Charles Paul, (Dad, Grandpa, Ron, RCP) passed away surrounded by family and love.\n\nBorn on June 10, 1942, Ron was a wonderful father, loving and devoted husband and genuinely good person. He is survived by his wife of almost 60 years, Marti (Ardis) Paul, his three children, Shari Paul, Shelley (Paul) and Terry Oachs and Rob and Lisa Paul, and four grandchildren, Garrett and Logan Oachs and Charlie and Savannah Paul.\n\nRon always had a song in his heart and on his lips. He shared his love of song with whoever would listen. Unfortunately he also knew disappointment in his life as he was an avid Minnesota Vikings fan. He has passed the torch to his family who is hoping for a Vikings Superbowl so we can share it with RCP.\n\nA celebration of life is planned on June 10th in Chandler AZ.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to the American Heart Association in the name of Ronald C. Paul.\n\nRon was deeply loved and will be deeply missed by his entire family.\n\nPublished on May 8, 2023\n\nPlant a Living Memorial\n\nIn Memory of RonaldHow does it work?\n\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\n\nNext-Day Delivery\n\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\n\nOrder any time up till the day before\n\nSame-Day Delivery\n\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\n\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\n\nMorning Delivery\n\nTUES-SAT Order by 3:00PM\n\nThe day before\n\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\n\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.
