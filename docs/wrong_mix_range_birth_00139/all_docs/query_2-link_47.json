        "text": "Senator Randal Howard Paul is an American politician and physician. He has been serving as a junior US Senator from Kentucky under the Democrats since 2011.\n\nSenator Rand Paul was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 7, 1963. He is the son of Ron Paul, an influential American Politician.\n\nWhen he was five years old, his family moved to Texas. Paul attended Baylor University from 1981 to 1984. But, he dropped out of Baylor University without completing his baccalaureate degree. Yet, he gained admission to the Duke University School of Medicine. He earned his medical degree at Duke University in 1988.\n\nAfter completing his residency in Ophthalmology in 1993, Paul moved to Bowling Green. There, he got his practicing license. He got a job at Downing McPeak Vision Centers for five years. He also worked at Graves Gilbert Clinic for ten years. After 15 years of practice, he created his medical practice.\n\nPaul specializes in cornea transplants and eye defect surgeries. In 2009, he established a nonprofit eye clinic to help provide free eye exams and surgeries. Senator Rand Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for his dedication to humanitarian works.\n\nSenator Rand Paul Career\n\nPaul started his political career as the head of a conservative group at Baylor University. He also managed many of his fatherâ€™s political campaigns. In 2009, Paul vouched to represent the Republicans at the US Senate to replace Kentucky incumbent Jim Bunning. But, he receded on his decision due to insufficient funding.\n\nYet, his supporters planned a money bomb, a grassroots fundraising effort to support a candidate for election. After two money bombs and a fundraiser, he raised more than $3 million. He won his primaries. Subsequently, he defeated Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway to win his seat in the Senate.\n\nIn 2016, Paul was re-elected after a failed attempt at his bid to represent Republicans for the Presidential elections.\n\nSenator Rand Paul Accomplishments\n\nPaul has worked tirelessly on affordable and accessible healthcare and improvement of education. His administration also fostered economic development by aiding the establishment of small businesses. He also ensured the reduction of social security benefits and the reduction of federal debt.\n\nPaul is an anti-abortion advocator and is 100% against abortion. He believes fertilization marks the beginning of life. He is also against same-sex marriage.\n\nPaul also worked on cannabis legalization in Kentucky. He introduced the career act to legalize medical cannabis at the federal level. He also introduced the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act.\n\nHe also sponsored and cosponsored several reforms and Action immigration and foreign policies.\n\nSenator Rand Paul Criticisms\n\nPaul has faced several plagiarism accusations. In 2013, Paul allegedly lifted lines from Wikipedia pages for many of his speeches. Also, a review of one of his works shows that he had plagiarized a magazine published a week earlier. Rand also faced malpractice lawsuits over issues of the validity of his certificate. But, the certification he claimed to have belonged to a dissolved medical body, National Ophthalmology Board, which he founded. The lawsuit was settled for $50,000."
