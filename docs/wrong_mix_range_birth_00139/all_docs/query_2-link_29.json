        "text": "Dear Mexican: My family for six generations have been born and raised in Brownsville, Texas. Right now, almost every Republican in the state is trying to work redistricting to cut out the bumper crop of Mexican-American candidates. They passed voter ID laws recently, and you begin to get the idea after a few citizen deportations to Mexico that the Texan Republican Legislature doesn't really like us.\n\nRon Paul has gotten some trace traction with Puerto Ricans and Florida Hispanics recently. That doesn't fix the fact that all of his homies in Texas who have voted for him every year HATE LOCAL HISPANICS. Can you take a quick look at his immigration and border policies and tell me what kind of mess it would make (or not) for a Mexican-American to pick Ron Paul, much less ANYONE, in the GOP?\n\n—Valley Vato\n\nDear Wab: As I've noted many times before, Mexicans are natural libertarians: want the government out of their lives, hate the drug war and love money. But when it comes to immigration, Paul is two tacos short of a combo plate. For a man who believes in open commerce, he wants to severely regulate immigration. For someone who believes in people being able to determine their own lives free of governmental diktat, he doesn't support the DREAM Act and wants to repeal birthright citizenship. For someone so right-on about America's imperial wars, he'd have America's military patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. That Paul's immigration policy is basically no different than that of his Republican colleagues is costing him millions of Mexi votes.\n\nUnlike many gabachas living in Tucson, I love living in a bilingual city and am trying to learn to speak better Spanish. Because of this, I am watching a lot of Spanish-language television. My problem? I am a science-fiction nerd. Although I enjoy the novelas, horror movies and game shows, I haven't found any good science-fiction shows to watch. Where can I look for Spanish shows with spaceships and lots of pew-pew-pew?\n\n—Where No Gabacha Has Gone Before"
