        "text": "On March 27, 1942, Rev. Andrew Y. Kuroda of the Salem Japanese Community Church completed a census of Japanese American Families living in Salem and Brook, Oregon. This list was found in the collections of the Oregon-Idaho United Methodist Church Archives in Salem. It is transcribed here for reference because it provides a unique look into Salem’s Japanese American community on the brink of tragedy.\n\nForced Removal\n\nOn May 22, 1942 Civilian Exclusion Order No. 91 was issued in San Francisco by Lieutenant General of the U.S. Army J.L. Dewitt. It ordered that:\n\nAfter 12 o’clock noon, P.W.T., of Wednesday June 3, 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien, be excluded from that portion of Military Area No. 1 described here as follows: All the counties of Lincoln, Polk, Marion, Benton and Linn and all the portion of the counties of Jefferson and Deschutes, State of Oregon, lying west of US Highway No. 97.\n\nAdditionally the order provided that all families register and prepare for removal and restricted travel, requiring permits for the simplest trips.\n\nOn June 3, families from the Salem area gathered at the train depot. Unlike counterparts in Portland and other parts of the state, individuals in the Salem area were not sent to so called “Assembly Centers,” but rather boarded the train directly bound of incarceration camp at Tule Lake, California.\n\nFamilies Scattered\n\nAfter the trauma of forced removal from their homes and livelihoods, many families chose not to return to the Mid-Willamette Valley. Through research for several exhibits, we have found some really great oral history interviews done with families, but scattered in their new home communities across the country. The final section of this page is a sourcebook and list of materials organized by surname for those wanting to do further research.\n\nTranscription of Document\n\nNotes on transcription.\n\nIn some cases we have spelled out abbreviations, when we thought abbreviations may be confusing (example O.S.C. refers to Oregon State College, an early name for the school that is now Oregon State University, etc.).\n\nEach household is numbered and the surname given with the address and if present the phone number. Individuals within the household are listed after.\n\nNotes on abbreviations from the original document:\n\n*Status in Christian Church Key\n\nC- Member; P-Prospect; B- to be baptized\n\n** Car Key\n\nS = sedan; CP = Coupe; T = Truck; P = Pickup; Tr = Tractor;\n\nList of Japanese Residents of Salem and Brooks, Ore.\n\nNo. Family Name (number of family members) First Name Sex Age Citizenship Special Skill Status in Christian Church Cars** 1 Fukuda (2) R.2.

Fukuda immigrated to Oregon in the late 1800s in search of opportunity. He worked on railroads and farmed for several years in other parts of the state. In the early 1900s, he moved to the Brooks area. Today, Fukuda is the man who is largely credited with starting the Japanese community in the Salem area, but at that time he was just trying to make a living in his new home. Fukuda and [Madison Lafayette Jones] shared a vision of what Lake Labish could be, and Fukuda succeed in convincing many of his former railroad and farm worker friends, as well as some people from Japan, to join him. M.L. [Jones] arranged to lease approximately 100 acres of his land to Fukuda, who in turn leased small acreages to various Japanese tenant farmers. By the early 1930s, the small community had grown to about 250 people (about 36 families) who farmed 5 to 10 acres each.\n\nThese were the Depression years. The Japanese community, like so many others around the country struggled to make a living. But the Japanese had a long tradition of coaxing great production from limited natural resources through hard, manual labor. Quality land is scarce in mountainous Japan. As a result, greenhouses have been used there for centuries. Greenhouses allowed farmers to start plants and grow vegetables even in the winter months. In Lake Labish, the greenhouses were used to produce two corps a year of celery and lettuce, two of the highest-priced crops in the country…The Lake Labish farmers also planted directly in the fields. Crops like onions, spinach, mint and other “money” crops were hardly enough to start from seed. However, it was the celery crop that made Lake Labish famous. By 1913, Fukuda had developed the “Golden Plume,” a white variety of celery that was said to be highly favored because of its delicate taste. People as far as the East Coast clamored for Fukuda’s Golden Plume, which only grew in Lake Labish.\n\nIn 1925, at the behest of Jones, and because of Golden Plume’s popularity Senator Charles L. McNary paid a visit to the Fukuda farm as a way to promote the community and its products. To show his appreciation, Fukuda sent a sample of the celery to Senator McNary and to President Coolidge. Later Fukuda recieved a letter form the White House thanking him. McNary’s senatorial colleagues also praised the celery as “the most delicious they had ever eaten.” By the 1930s celery production by the growers association increased to 700 carloads a year. The high demand for this product led Fukuda to form a co-operative, the Labish Celery Growers Union. Later a second co-op was created as the market expanded.\n\nOther Resources:\n\nPioneer Cemetery Biography of Roy Fukuda written by Bryan Fukuda\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nPhotos of Matsuye Ishida in the Willamette Heritage Center Collections:\n\nMarch 1934 Hayesville Primary Division (see image above) 2020.004.0004\n\nApril 1935 Hayesville Primary Division WHC Collections 2020.004.0003\n\nApril 1938 Hayesville Advanced WHC Collections 2020.004.0005\n\nApril 1936 Hayesville Intermediate Division.

By 1920, he resided at Chemawa, Oregon and was a truck gardener, but he traveled back to Japan one or more times possibly as a merchant seaman. A trip back from Japan, prior to WWII, put him ashore in Seattle in Jun of 1924. He married Yasue Kawata soon after, then took up farming again in Brooks, Oregon.\n\nThe Kawata family was still farming in Brooks in 1930 but three daughters had been added: Toyoko Kawata 4 (F), Hisoko Kawata 3 (F) and Nobuko Kawata 2 (F). (Although a fourth daughter, Yoshie, later claimed to be born on 1 Dec 1929, she did not show on the 1930 census.) A great aunt, Haya Fujimoto 63, was living with the family as well as two lodgers, Tamakichi Murata age 37 and Marulino Ducusin.\n\nThe 1940 census shows Minoru and family still farming on Van Cleave Rd in Brooks. 40-year-old Minoru had taken on a partner, 19-year-old Kiyoo Tomiyama, who was born in Oregon but lived in Japan as late as 1935. Minoru and wife Yasue were considered resident aliens. Their four daughters were U.S. citizens.\n\nThe entire Kawata family was forcibly removed from Brooks and transported to the Tule Lake Camp in June 1942. In September 1943, the family was moved to Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming. Members of the Kawata family were not all released at the same time nor to the same final destination. Final relocation records show the oldest daughter, Toyoko, was released April 1945 to live in Philadelphia, PA. The rest of the family was released in September and October 1945 in order to return to Portland, Brooks and Salem, Oregon.\n\nIn 1949, all four of the daughters still had connections with the Salem area and were invited to a shower for Miss Vilora Williams in July of that year.\n\nBy 1950, Minoru (also known as Carl), was managing an apartment building in Portland with Yasue. Two daughters, Hisako and Nubuko were living with them along with several boarders. At the time, there seems to be no record of Toyoko and Yoshie (Kathryn) was a patient at the Oregon State TB Hospital in The Dalles, OR.\n\nMinoru did not give up his traveling ways. After 9 months as a ship’s quartermaster, with stops in Japan, he returned to Oregon in May 1954. Toyoko appears again with her marriage to George Hirata of Portland, a maintenance worker, in March 1953. In the years 1955-1960, Minoru and Yasue managed and lived in more than one hotel/rooming house in downtown Portland while Minoru still worked in the lumber import/export trade. Hisako, Nobuko (Irene) and Yoshie (Kathryn) lived with the couple. By 1957, the five had moved to a home in NE Portland. Yasue still managed a hotel, Minoru and Yoshie (Kathryn) worked for the West Coast Oriental and Nobuko (Irene) was an office worker. Hisako still lived with the family but claimed no profession.\n\nIn 1960, Irene Hirata (Toyoko) was still a clerk at West Coast Oriental. She and husband George, a welder at the time, were living at 2644 SE 74th. On 10 Dec 1961, Kathryn (Yoshie), then a teacher, wed Minoru Calvin Nitta in Portland, OR.\n\nIn November 1964, 62-year-old Yasue suffered a fractured collarbone in a car accident on Oregon Hwy 18 about 4.5 miles west of Grand Ronde. The driver, 78-year-old Henry Yahichi Kato, was killed.\n\nMinoru Kawata passed away at age 67 on 22 Apr 1966. At the time, he was simi-retired from the lumber import/export business with the West Coast Orient Co., Coos Bay, OR. Japanese resident aliens were not allowed to acquire US citizenship until 1952 and Minoru never did so. Yasue, died in Multnomah County at age 77 on 22 Dec 1980. Her citizenship status is unknown but likely she was still a resident alien.\n\nToyoko’s husband George S Hirata died on 14 Oct 1983 and 10 years later, Toyoko was living at 2644 SE 74th Av in Portland. County records show that she sold the house in Dec 2010 and that is the last record available for her.\n\nAfter Nobuko (Irene) married in 1960, she and husband Kenzo Nakagawa may have moved almost immediately to central California. Public records show them established in Modesto in 1987 through 1991. They later moved to southern California where Kenzo died in Westlake Village on 15 Apr 2014. Unfortunately, there seems to be no further records of Nobuko available.\n\nAfter youngest daughter Yoshie (Katheryn) married Minoru Calvin Nitta in 1961, the couple remained in Portland. She most likely continued teaching there when they resided at 1171 SE Lexington St. They had two sons, James (b 1965), Gregg (b 1969). Some records may be private but, these appear to be the only two grandchildren of Minora and Yasue Kawata. Yoshie passed away on 8 Oct 2008 in Portland.\n\nResearched and written by Mike Nugent, 2023\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Minoru, C (M) Yasue (F) Toyoko (F) Hisako (F) Nobuko (F) Yoshie (F) Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr None None None None None None Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Father’s Occ Farmer Managerial Blank Blank Blank Blank Total Schooling in Japan 8 yrs 8 yrs None None None None Educational Degree None None None None None None Year First Arrived in US 1913 1924 — — — — Length of Time in Japan 15-20 yrs 20+ yrs None None None None Visits to Japan 2 1 Never Never Never Never Indv Number 15761A 403046 15761C 15761D 403049 403050 Year of Birth 1896 1903 1925 1926 1928 1929 Place of Birth Japan Japan Oregon Oregon Oregon Oregon Religion Buddhist Protestant Protestant Protestant Protestant Protestant\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Minoru, C (M) Yasue (F) Toyoko (F) Hisako (F) Nobuko (F) Yoshie (F) DOB 6 Oct 1899 23 May 1904 4 Sep 1925 24 Sep 1926 10 Mar 1928 1 Dec 1929 Marital Status M M S S S S Citizenship Alien Alien US US US US Sex M F F F F F Original Entry Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Date of Entry 21 Sep 1943 21 Sep 1943 21 Sep 1943 21 Sep 1943 21 Sep 1943 21 Sep 1943 Pre Evac Add Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Dep 25 Sep 1945 5 Oct 1945 16 Apr 1945 5 Oct 1945 21 Sep 1945 21 Sep 1945 Age at Dep 46 39 20 19 17 16 Destination Portland Portland Philadelphia, PA Portland, OR Salem, OR Brooks, OR\n\nBackground: Salem Leadership Foundation article “Japanese Community Church and the Japanese Community in Salem” by slfadmin, 17 Jul 2017, Salem Faith History. https://www.salemlf.org/2017/07/17/japanese-community/\n\n1918 WW1 Draft Record: Minoru Kawata 19.

Both his parents were Japanese citizens. Not much is known about the family until 1940 when they appear in the thriving Japanese Community in Brooks, Oregon.\n\n1940 was a very busy year for the family. 26-year-old Masato, traveled to Japan returning by ship on 29 Feb. Accompanying him was his future wife, Haruko Satogata who was born in 1919 in Wapato, Washington. The couple was married on 25 Mar 1940 when they both claimed to live at Rt 1 Box 285, Brooks, OR. In the 1940 Census taken later that year, they are both shown to be farm workers. In October, Masato registered for the draft and said he was employed by U. Kaneko.\n\nOn 6 Aug 1941 the couple welcomed a baby girl, Florence Kiako Kinoshita. But the clouds of war were approaching U.S. shores. On 2 Jun 1942, Masato Kinoshita and his little family were forcibly removed from Brooks and transported to the Tule Lake Camp. The family was released almost exactly a year later. The record does not show where they planned to relocate.\n\nAfter the Kinoshita family’s release, information about their lives is slim. Not until the 1970s, does Florence appear attending medical school in Chicago. Later, in the 1990’s she worked as a toxicologist at the Hercules Co. in Wilmington, Delaware. Masato and Haruko appear in Phoenix, Arizona in the early 1990’s. They later moved to Mesa where Masato passed away in 2012. There is no record of Haruko’s passing. In her parents’ later years, Florence, who never married, moved to Mesa to be closer to them. She passed away at age 80 on 2 Nov 2021 in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nThis biography was researched and compiled by Mike Nugent.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data: Masato Kinoshita Family\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Masato (M) Haruko (F) Florence K (F) Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr None None None Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) Japan, Japan Japan, Japan US, US Father’s Occ Farmer Farmer Farmer Total Schooling in Japan 8 yrs 8 Yrs None Educational Degree None None None Year First Arrived in US No Entry No Entry — Length of Time in Japan 15-20 yrs 20+ yrs Never Visits to Japan 2 1 None Indv Number 15741A 403282 403283 Year of Birth 1914 1918 1941 Place of Birth Oregon Washington Oregon Religion Buddhist Buddhist N/A\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Masato Haruko Florence Kiako DOB 1 Apr 1914 18 Oct 1915 6 Aug 1941 Marital Status M M S Citizenship C C Sex M F Original Entry Direct Entry Direct Entry Direct Entry Date of Entry 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Dep 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 Age at Dep 29-30 28 2 Destination UKN UKN UKN\n\n1914 Oregon State Births.

Memorials follow:\n\nLois Kotkoskie, Colleague, 14 Jan 2022. My name is Lois Kotkoskie. I knew Florence professionally when she was a toxicologist at Hercules in Wilmington Delaware in the 1990s. I was just starting out in my career at that time and she was a great resource. I truly admired and respected her very much. She always had a great way of looking at the world. My thoughts and prayers are with the Kinoshita family.\n\nSusie Winton, 1 Dec 2021. I was newly married and had moved to Chicago to be with Lee, my then medical student husband, when, as I remember it, Florence just appeared. They were classmates, I was new, and she, in her quiet way, was there to help.\n\nShe became a good friend and, some years later, godmother to our first child. Though our lives eventually headed in different directions, we always touched base at Christmas with a note and a cross country gift exchange. Our children, now grown and living elsewhere, still remember that, for them, there was Santa Claus… and then there was Florence, some wondrous elf or, as it were, fairy godmother, who somehow knew the very thing that each child would most love. We sent pears.\n\nIn fact, after probably more than 30 years, this past year, due to health distractions here, was the first that we failed to get in touch, and we missed hearing from Florence as well.\n\nI am so sorry not to have reached out and sad not to be sending our usual pears to Mesa. But Florence is very much in our thoughts and will continue to be, as she always has been, at this time of year.\n\nLois Hall, 18 Nov 2021. My name is Lois Hall. I knew Florence for over 40 years. My husband and I lived in the same apartment building as Florence when she worked for Hercules in Wilmington, Delaware. She shared in the joy of our children, Amanda and Jason and was a welcome visitor when we moved to our house to accommodate our family.\n\nI’m am a recent widow but have my children and grandchildren nearby which is a blessing.\n\nFlorence was a true friend.\n\nRead biography of John Kyono here.\n\nParents\n\nChildren\n\nChisato (Jack) Morioka (1899-1971) Tatuso (Glen) Morioka (1923-2011) Chisoa Umida Morioka (1905-1987) Emiko (Emie) Morioka Wada (1925-2015) George Morioka (1929-2007)\n\nChemawa -> Tule Lake -> Ontario, Oregon -> Los Angeles, CA\n\nMi\n\nThe Morioka Family (R.7 Box 245, Salem)\n\nChisato Morioka was born in Japan 1 Jul 1899 and emigrated to the US in 1915. In He returned to Japan to marry Chisoa Umida on 27 Jan 1922. The couple returned to the US in March of that year to farm in Chemawa, OR where they had two sons and a daughter: Tatsuo (Glen), Emiko (Emie), and George. They remained in Chemawa through 1940.\n\nShortly after the 1940 Federal Census was taken, Emiko, age 14, was sent to Japan to continue her education. She remained there through the outbreak of WW2 and was forced to work in a munitions factory outside the city of Hiroshima. She was not able to return to her family in the US until she was 21.\n\nOn 2 Jun 1942, Chisato, Chisoa and the two sons were forcibly removed from Chemawa and transported to the Tule Lake internee camp for the duration of WW2. The family was released on 1 May 1944 and decided to settle in Ontario, OR. Oddly, the release records show that youngest son George, age 15, planned to take up residence in Dayton, WA. He may have lived with a relative there to attend school until he returned to the family in Ontario. Daughter Emiko (now going by the name Emie) rejoined the family in 1946.\n\nOn 3 Feb 1947, at age 23, the oldest son Glen (Tatsuo) married Maxine Kimko Sato in Ontario. On 8 Dec 1949, at age 24, Emie married Shingo Wada, a farmer and former Intelligence Officer with the US occupation forces in Japan.\n\nEmie and Shingo remained in Ontario and built a very successful farming operation along with Shingo’s brother. The couple had one son and two daughters. Shingo passed away in Ontario on 29 May 2009. After a life devoted to making a better life for her children and grandchildren, Emie passed away in Wilsonville, OR 8 May 2015 and was buried back in Ontario.\n\nShortly before1950, the rest of the extended Morioka family had moved to a suburb of Los Angeles, CA. Glen had become the head of the family which now included in one household, his wife, his two young children (Blanch 1 and Infant Gregory), his father and mother and, his younger bachelor brother George. Together, the family tried their hand at a landscape gardening enterprise.\n\nLater in 1950 then in 1954 respectively, Chisato (Jack) and Chisoa applied for and were granted US citizenship. Chisao passed away on 18 May 1987 in Santa Clara, CA and Jack passed in Apr 1971 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe landscape business didn’t last too long as we find Glen owning and running a small hotel near LA’s Japan Town until 1955. A life change took the family to Gilroy and Morgan Hill, CA, where they farmed strawberries and had their two youngest children. Later Glen and brother George worked at Ford Motor Company. After 24 years of service, he took early retirement in 1983.\n\nThe youngest son George passed away in Gilroy, CA on 17 Jul 2007 at age 78 after a long career with Ford Motor Company. He was married with five children. Glen passed away in Morgan Hill, CA (30 minutes north of Gilroy) on 6 Jan 2011. He also left his wife Maxine and five children.\n\nResearch: The Morioka Family (R.7 Box 245, Salem)\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Chisato J Chisao Glen T George Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr None None None None Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Japan, Japan Father’s Occ Manager Ukn Farm Manager Farm Manager Total Schooling in Japan 8 yrs 6 yrs None None Educational Degree None None None None Year First Arrived in US 1915 1922 — — Length of Time in Japan 15-20 15-20 yrs None None Visits to Japan 3 2 Never Never Indv Number 1574A 403302 403303 15747D Year of Birth 1899 1905 1923 1929 Place of Birth Japan Japan Oregon Oregon Religion Buddist Buddhist Buddhist Buddhist\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Chisato Jack Chisao Glen T George DOB 1 Jul 1899 2 Jan 1905 11 Jul 1923 1 Jul 1929 Marital Status M M M S Citizenship Alien Alien US US Sex M F M M Original Entry Date of Entry 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Salem, OR Salem, OR Salem, OR Salem, OR Date of Dep 1 May 1944 1 May 1944 1 May 1944 1 May 1944 Age at Dep 45 39 21 15 Destination Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Dayton, WA\n\n1930 Federal Census: J C Morioka 32 b abt 1898 in Japan.

Obit:\n\nGeorge Morioka was born in Portland, Oregon on January 7, 1929 and passed away in Gilroy on July 17, 2007 at the age of 78. He was an internee at Tule Lake and later a resident of Morgan Hill since 1946. A long-time employee of Ford Motor Company, he retired in 1986. He also worked many years as a farmer and a gardener in Santa Clara County. George was an avid fisherman and crabber whose generosity with his catch, his time and whatever he had, was legendary. He is survived by his loving wife Norma, his brother Glen Morioka, sister Emie Wada, his children Cindy Perez, Barbara Manegold, Jeff Morioka, Susan Sakai, Michael Morioka and nine grandchildren. Services will be held on Friday, July 20th at 7:00 p.m. at Johnson Funeral Home in Morgan Hill. Friends are welcome and attire is casual.

Obit\n\nGlen T. Morioka, Nov. 7, 1923 – Jan. 6, 2011, resident of Morgan Hill, died peacefully on January 6, 2011, surrounded by his loving wife and children. Glen was born November 1923 in Salem Oregon, and graduated from Salem High School in 1942. Glen was Captain of his high school baseball team and was scouted for the minor leagues just before the war broke out. His family was relocated to the Tule Lake Relocation Center until September 1942. In 1943, he moved to Ontario, OR to farm with his parents. There he met Maxine, and they married in 1947. After the birth of their first two children, they moved to Los Angeles, CA, where they owned and ran a small hotel near Japan Town until 1955. Their third child arrived during this time. A life change took the family to Gilroy and Morgan Hill, CA, where they farmed strawberries and had their two youngest children. Later Glen worked at Ford Motor Company in the Quality Control Dept. After 24 years of service he took early retirement in 1983. Glen was an avid fisherman and hunter. His greatest love was being on the road, driving to the next great fishing hole. He is survived by his loving wife Maxine, his five children Aiko (Peter), Gregory, Steven (Linda), Russell (Sandra) and Penny (Scott); his three grandchildren, Brandon (Becky), Sherri and Brian and two great grandchildren Jacob and Nathan, his sister Emie Wada and many nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held at 2:30pm on Friday, January 14th, 2011 in the chapel at Johnson Funeral Home, 17720 Monterey Street, Morgan Hill, CA. Reception to follow.

D 8 May 2015 at age 89 in Wilsonville, OR. Buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Ontario, OR.\n\nEmie Wada passed away on May 8, 2015 in Wilsonville, Oregon at the age of 89. The daughter of Chisato and Chisao Morioka, Emie was born on May 20, 1925 in Salem, Oregon.\n\nEmie attended school in the Salem area until the age of 14 when she was sent to Japan to continue her education. Two years after her arrival, her schooling abruptly ended when the war broke out and the students were forced to work in a munitions factory outside the city of Hiroshima. Emie was unable to return home until after the war ended. At age 21, she came back to the U.S. to live with her family who relocated to Ontario, Oregon after their internment at Tule Lake.\n\nOn December 8, 1949, she married Shingo Wada and together they had three children: Sharon, Mark and Stephanie. Emie was active in the church and enjoyed playing golf and cards, traveling, gardening, and artistic endeavors such as painting, pottery, and creating a beautiful home. For many years Emie hosted large holiday dinners with Martha Stewart flair. She was an excellent cook and her love for her family was evident in the food she prepared. Emie’s bento (box lunches) and care packages were legendary among her kids’ college friends. She rose well before the sun to make elaborate bento for the car ride back to school and in later years when her children and grandchildren came to visit. “Box breakfast” would be a better descriptor for at least one family who could never wait until lunch time to enjoy Emie’s cooking.\n\nEmie had a wonderful sense of style. She had an eye for beautiful, well-made clothes and was a sight to behold when she was dressed to the nines for an evening out. Emie loved to shop. This cannot be overstated. Frequent shopping trips to Boise are a fond memory of her children who loved that she scheduled annual trips to Portland and the Washington coast to coincide with the Nordstrom anniversary sale. All of Emie’s grandchildren are girls, and there’s no doubt she delighted in another generation of shopping cohorts who clearly inherited the Emie shopping gene.\n\nMuch of Emie’s life was devoted to making a better life for her children. Whether it was the countless hours she spent listening and encouraging as they practiced the piano, showing by example the importance of doing a job well, giving them the support they needed to do their best in school, or diligently saving for their college education, Emie always put her children’s needs and later her grandchildren’s needs first.\n\nEmie is survived by her son Mark Wada (Robin), daughter Stephanie Fifer (Eric) and granddaughters Jennifer Humphreys (Brian), Kimberly Bradley (Rick), Ashley Mercer, Rachel Wada, Emily Wada, Elizabeth Fifer, Annie Fifer, three great-grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. Her parents, brothers Glen and George Morioka, husband Shingo and daughter Sharon Spencer preceded her in death.\n\nSpecial thanks to Emie’s caregivers in Ontario and to the staff at Springridge Court in Wilsonville, Oregon who cared for Emie with such love and respect.\n\nServices will be held on Saturday, May 16th, at 3:00 pm at the Ontario Community Church.\n\nParents\n\nChildren\n\nTamekichi Murata (1895-1968)\n\nChemawa, Oregon -> Tule Lake -> Heart Mountain -> Brooks, Oregon -> Possibly Japan?\n\nTamekichi Murata was born 25 Jan 1895 in Japan and emigrated to the US in 1920. There is some indication that he may have been a merchant seaman for some time. However, by 1930, he was settled in Brooks, OR where he took up truck farming. He lived for some years with the Minora Kawata family and worked on their rented farmland. By 1940, Tamekichi was working his own rented land near Chemawa, OR.\n\nLike all other persons of Japanese descent in and around Salem, OR, Tamekichi was sent to California’s Tule Lake internment camp in June of 1942. He was eventually transferred to Wyoming’s Heart Mountain Camp then released from there September of 1945 when the record shows him as a resident alien. He did not tell the authorities where he planned to settle after being released. Many other former Salem area Japanese individuals and families decided not to return to the Salem area and apparently Tamekichi was one of them.\n\nTamekichi’s trail is very cloudy after his release. He does not appear in the 1950 census or other typical records for many years after that time. His friends and former employers, the Kawata’s did not return to farming but took up lives in Portland so they may not have had work for him there. Not until 1968 do we find Tamekichi’s Social Security Death Record showing his correct birth date, a Social Security number issued in Oregon and, his death in July of 1968. Oddly, the death notice indicates that his last residence was in Asia.\n\nThere is no indication that Tamekichi gained US citizenship but he did have a Social Security account. If he passed away overseas and the US Embassy was notified, the Bureau of Consular Affairs would have tried to find any relative in the US that could be eligible for his death benefits. This would have created the Social Security Death Record. So, it is at least possible that Tamekichi returned to Japan sometime after his release from internment.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Murata)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Tamekich (i) Relocation Proj Tule Lake Assembly Ctr Last Address Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nFather’s Occ Fisherman Total Schooling in Japan 6 Educational Degree Year First Arrived in US 1920 Length of Time in Japan 20+ Visits to Japan 7 Indv Number 15716A Year of Birth 1895 Place of Birth S Japan Religion Buddhist Skills Truck Farmer\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Tamekichi DOB 25 Jan 1895 Marital Status S Citizenship J Sex M Original Entry Salem, OR Date of Entry 21 Sep 1943 Pre Evac Add Salem, OR Date of Dep 18 Sep 1945 Age at Dep 50 Destination Brooks, OR Rel from H Mtn\n\n1926 NY Arriving Pass and Crew.

Masaye “Mason” Nakamura Hatamiya (1917-1990) Misaichi Nakamura (1919-?)\n\n*Records show John Nakamura using several other first names: Johnnie, Shomon, Shoemon, Shouemon, Massemon, Matasaburo, Missomon. Most common is a version of Shomon.\n\nSalem-> Tule Lake / Minidoka -> Portland\n\nShomon Nakamura was born on 15 Aug 1882 in Japan and he immigrated to the US in 1906. Tsuru Iki was born on 14 Jan 1894. She immigrated to the US on 14 Feb 1914 and her naturalization record shows the two married on that same day. Their first daughter Fumiko was born in Independence, OR on 14 Nov 1914. Three years later, on 3 Jan 1917, their second daughter Masaye was born in Independence.\n\nShomon and Tsuru visited Japan from July 1919 through Mar 1920. Their naturalization record shows their only son, Misaichi was born there on 19 Sep 1919. They apparently left the child there because he is not shown in any US records until the couple applied for US citizenship in 1955 when Misaichi is shown to be living in Japan.\n\nIn 1928, Fumiko (15) and Masaye (11) returned from Japan after having stayed with their uncle Mr. C Hakamura for an unknown period. However, records show that they each had some years of schooling in Japan. They returned to Salem in March of 1928.\n\nIn 1930, the family of four was living near Salem while Shomon was a foreman at a hop farm. The daughters continued their education in the Salem public schools. 17-year-old Fumiko married merchant Kyirio Kido in November of 1931 in Portland. Within two years, the couple had two daughters Alice and Jean. Masaye graduated from Salem High School in 1938.\n\nIn March of 1940, Fumiko returned from a trip to Japan visiting a grandmother, Mrs. Sono Ike (likely Tsuru’s mother). Shomon and Tsuru also visited Japan two times after their marriage but the exact dates are unknown. There seems to be no 1940 Federal census records for the family. However, when Shomon registered for the draft in April of 1942, he is working a major hop distributer, T A Livesley and Co. while the family lived in rural Salem.\n\nLike all other persons of Japanese descent in and around Salem, OR, the Nakamura family was sent to California’s Tule Lake internment camp in June of 1942. Fumiko’s family was sent to the facility in Minidoka, Idaho. Upon their release the summer of 1945, both families moved to Portland. Apparently Shomon never returned to his very successful career in the hop distribution business in Salem.\n\nMasaye married Frank J Hatamiya and they moved to Sutter County, CA by 1950 but, there is little information available about Shomon and Tsuru after their release. The couple applied for US Citizenship in 1955 while living as a retired pair in Portland, OR.\n\nShomon passed away in Portland in Apr 1973 but there is no record of Tsuru’s death. Masaye passed away in Live Oak, CA June of 1990 and Fumiko passed away in Portland on 22 Oct 2006.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Nakamura)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) (Shomon) John (59) Tsuru (47) Masaye (24) Fumiko Kida Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tue Lake Minidoka Assembly Ctr Last Address Marion, Oregon Oregon Marion, Oregon Oregon Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan Father’s Occ Farm Ops Farm Ops Farm Ops M Japan Total Schooling in Japan 6 4 7 Educational Degree None None HS 1yr HS in Japan Year First Arrived in US 1906 1914 Length of Time in Japan 20+ 20+ 5-10 1-8 yrs Visits to Japan 2 3 1 2 Indv Number 15752A 15752B 15752C Year of Birth 1882 1894 1917 1914 Place of Birth Japan Japan Oregon Oregon Religion Buddhist Buddhist Buddhist Not shown Skill Crop Farmer Bookkeeper Sales Clerk\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) (Shomon John) Johnny Tsuru Masaye\n\n(Mason)\n\nFumiko Kida (Minifoka, ID) DOB 18 Aug 1882 4 Jan 1894 5 Jun 1917 4 Apr 1914 Marital Status M M M M Citizenship J J J US Sex M F F F Original Entry Salem, OR Salem, OR Salem, OR Portland, OR Date of Entry 30 Sep 1943 30 Sep 1943 30 Sep 1943 10 Sep 1942 Pre Evac Add Salem, OR Salem, OR Hood River, OR Portland, OR Date of Dep 20 Sep 1945 20 Sep 1945 29 Jun 1945 27 Apr 1945 Age at Dep 63 49 24 31 Destination Portland, OR Portland, OR Portland, OR Portland, OR\n\n1914 Oregon State Birth Record.

This is the story of their families:\n\nParents\n\nChildren\n\nKiyoji (Charles) Ogura (1883-1967) Tomito (Tommy) Ogura (1916-1967) Chiyo Nakashima (1897-1975) Minnie Ogura Itow (1919-?) Sumi Ogura Oshiro (1921 -2008) Richard William Orgura(1926-1965) Fordice Henry Ogura(1928-1995) Chiyo Esther Ogrua Semba (1930-1987)\n\nBrooks -> Tule Lake -> Ontario, Oregon/California/New York City/Boise, ID\n\nKiyoji (Charles) Ogura was born in Japan on 23 Aug 1883 and claimed to have immigrated to the US in 1900 at age 17. Little is known of Charles’ early years in the US but in 1915 at age 32, he married 18-year-old, US born Chiyo Nakashima. By 1918 the couple was farming in rural Portland, OR and began building a family. Their children were born over the next several years: Tomito Tommy (1916), Minnie (1919), Sumi (1921), Richard William (1926), Fordice Henry (1928) and Chiyo Esther (1930)\n\nBetween 1920 and 1930, the family moved south to farm on rented land near Books, OR. As was common in Japanese some families, the Ogura’s sent some of their children to Japan for visits or short periods of schooling. In 1936, Tomito, Minnie and Sumi all visited relatives in Japan. Tomito (Tommy) returned to attend University of Oregon for three years but by 1940, all the children were back on the family farm in Brooks. By then, father Charles owned and managed the land.\n\nIn April of 1940 Tommy married Miss Toshiko Tsugawa of Hillsboro, OR and they planned to work the Ogura farm in Brooks. However, buy the end of the year, the couple was living in the Hillsdale neighborhood of Portland where Tommy was self-employed. Their daughter Raiko (Patsy) was born in 1941. Father Charles K, mother Chiyo and siblings Minnie (21), Sumi (19), Richard (13), Henry (11) and Esther (10) remained on the family farm in Brooks.\n\nAs a result of the start of WW2, the entire Ogura family was transported to the Tule Lake Japanese Internment Camp at Tule Lake, CA. on 2 Jul 1942. After realizing what was to come, Tommy, Toshiko with their one-year-old daughter Raiko, returned to Brooks so the whole family could be interned together. The family spent just over a year at Tule Lake and were released between 15 Jun and 1 Jul 1943.\n\nRecords indicate that the entire family planned to settle in Ontario, OR upon release with one exception. For an unknown reason, little Raiko was to be taken to Vale, OR. possibly to be with relatives while Tommy and Toshiko establish a home in Ontario. In 1944 Richard (William) enlisted fin the US Army or a period of about 4 years.\n\nIn Dec 1949, Sumi married Henry Oshita in Ontario and settled in Southern California. Also, before 1950, Esther married Russ Semba and settled in Central California. By 1950, Charles and Chiyo were farming Malheur County, OR along with Richard (24) and Henry (21). Tommy’s family lived close by while he worked at a radio and appliance salesman. Minnie, now 20 had relocated to New York City and was looking for work. In 1954, Henry married Mary Tsuyake Shigeno, a stenographer. They planned to reside in Boise, ID.\n\nIn 1952, Richard married Mary Y Mio from Salem and they settled in Ontario. They had a son and two daughters born in 1954, 1956 and 1960. Richard was his father Charles’ partner in farming. However, their lives took a drastic turn in 1965 when Mary shot and killed Richard before killing herself at their home in Ontario. It is said that Mary was despondent about an unspecified illness. The children were home at the time. They were taken in by unnamed relatives.\n\nRichard’s death left elderly Charles to farm their property alone and it was too much for him. In early 1966, Charles auctioned off all their farming equipment and retired. Charles died almost exactly one year later on 21 Feb 1967. Sadly, Tommy now age 50, died just a few days earlier leaving his wife and four daughters.\n\nChiyo died in 1975 and is buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Ontario. Esther died at age 57 on 5 Jan 1987 in Carmichael, CA. Henry died at age 66 in Yakima, WA in 1995. Sumi divorced in 1982 in Los Angeles and died at age 77 in Covina, CA on 21 Jan 2008.\n\nMinnie stayed in New York and married Mishima Itow in 1964 but her records are slim after that. She may have moved to Covina, CA around 1990 but was back in Long Island, NY in 1992. There is no available record of her passing and she would be 104 in 2023.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Ogura)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Charles K (59) Chiyo (44) Tommy T (25) Toshiko (21) Patsy R (3.5) Minnie (23) Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nFather’s Occ Ukn Farmer Farm Ops Managerial Farm Ops Farm Ops Total Schooling in Japan 8 None None None None 2 Educational Degree No Degree No Degree No Degree No Degree No Degree No Degree Highest Grade College 3 yrs HS 4 years HS 4 years Year First Arrived in US 1900 NA NA NA NA NA Length of Time in Japan 15-20 Never in Japan Under 6 mo Never in Japan Never in Japan 1-5 yrs Visits to Japan 1 None 1 1 Indv Number 15768A 15768B 19769A 15769B 15769C 15768C Year of Birth 1883 1897 1916 1920 1941 1919 Marital Status M M M M S S Race Indv/Spouse J/J J/J J/J J/J NA NA Place of Birth Japan Washington Oregon Washington Oregon Oregon Religion Methodist Methodist Methodist Methodist Methodist Methodist Skill Truck Farmer Farm Hand Truck Farmer Sales Clerk NA Sales Clerk\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Ogura)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Sumi (21) OSC Richard (15) Henry F(13) Esther C (10) Relocation Proj Tule Lake None shown Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr Born in 1926 Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM US\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nF Japan\n\nM US\n\nFather’s Occ Farm Ops Farm Ops Farm Ops Total Schooling in Japan None None None Educational Degree College 1 yr No Degree No Degree Year First Arrived in US NA NA NA Length of Time in Japan 1-5 yrs Never in Japan Never in Japan Visits to Japan 1 0 0 Indv Number 15768D No 15768E shown 15768F 15768G Year of Birth 1921 1928 1931 Place of Birth Oregon Oregon Oregon Religion Methodist Methodist Methodist Skill Farm Hand None None\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Kiyoji (Charles) Chiyo Tomito Tommy Toshiko Raiko Patsy Minnie DOB 23 Aug 1883 23 Oct 1897 4 Jul 1916 1 Mar 1920 9 Oct 1941 6 Mar 1919 Marital Status M M M M S S Citizenship J J US US US US Sex M M M F F F Original Entry Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Entry 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Dep 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 15 Jun 1943 Age at Dep 60 46 27 22 2 24 Destination Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Vale, OR Ontario, OR\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Sumi Richard William Fordyce Henry Chiyo Esther DOB 26 Jan 1921 10 Apr 1926 19 Sep 1928 1 Nov 1930 Marital Status S S S S Citizenship US US US US Sex F F M F Original Entry Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Entry 15 Jun 1942 15 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Dep 1 Jul 1943 1 Jul 1943 1 Jul 1943 1 Jul 1943 Age at Dep 21 17 15 13 Destination Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Ontario, OR Ontario, OR\n\n1916 Oregon Birth Record.

His older brother a Kyioji (Charles) immigrated in 1900 and Fred may have lived with him near Salem for some time but that cannot be confirmed. So, not much is known about Fred’s life for his first 15 years in the US. In 1930, he appears as a boarder and farm helper living with the Tatsuye Oguma family in Marshland, Columbia County, OR. Tatsuye’s wife, Sayo was just one year older than Fred and the Oguma family included daughters Hatsue age 12 and Chizuko (Virginia) age 10.\n\nIn 1938, the Portland, OR City Directory shows Fred living in Portland with Sayo and working as a grocer. Not until Jan 1940 did Fred marry the now divorced Sayo. Their Washington marriage license application showed them living at the same address in Vancouver. Apparently Sayo divorced Tatsuye but there seems to be no official record of the separation. There also seems to be no record of Tatsuye Oguma or his daughter Hatsue after 1938. Hatsue was 18 to 20 at the time so, it is at least possible that she and her father decided to return to Japan which resulted from the divorce or was a reason for the divorce.\n\nIn 1940, Fred, Sayo and her daughter Chizuko (20) were living on Alta St in Portland. Fred was a proprietor and grocer. However, in early 1942, the family moved to Brooks, OR and the farm home of Fred’s brother C K Ogura. This move may have resulted from realization that internment is eminent. The two Ogura families were removed to Tule Lake on the same day in Jun 1942.\n\nFred and family were released from Tule Lake on 23 Sep 1943, a few months after C K’s family. Fred and Sayo did not say where they planned to live, but 23-year-old Chizuko (Virginia) said she was moving to Vale, OR. A two-year-old member of C K’s family also went to Vale for some reason while the rest of her extended family went to Ontario, OR.\n\nBy 1950 54-year-old Fred was unemployed (apparently retired) and living in an apartment on Alaska St in Portland along with Sayo. In short order, Fred and Sayo moved to Los Angeles, CA possibly because the now married Chizuko Virginia was there. In 1954, Fred obtained his U S citizenship. Three short years later, in Mar 1957 Chizuko Virginia passed away from an unknown cause, leaving a son, Dennis. There is no record of her husband being in the picture.\n\nSayo passed away in May 1975 and is buried with daughter Chizuko Virginia in the Evergreen Cemetery, Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Fred died in Dec 1978 and is buried with his wife and daughter.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Ogura)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Fred (46) Sayo (47) Virginia C (22) OSC Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake Tule Lake Assembly Ctr Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nFather’s Occ Farm Mgr Management Total Schooling in Japan 13 8 None Educational Degree HS in Japan No Degree 1 yr College Year First Arrived in US 1915 1917 NA Length of Time in Japan 15-20 20+ Less than 6 mos Visits to Japan 1 2 1 Indv Number 15715A 15715B 15715C Year of Birth 1895 1894 1920 Place of Birth Japan Japan Oregon Religion Buddhist Buddhist Methodist Skill Retail Manager Sales Clerk Sales Clerk\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) (Sueo) Fred Sayo (Chisuko) Virginia DOB 3 Mar 1895 24 Jul 1894 19 Jan 1920 Marital Status M F F Citizenship J J US Sex M M F Original Entry Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Entry 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Brooks, OR Date of Dep 25 Sep1943 25 Sep 1943 24 Sep 1943 Age at Dep 48 49 23 Destination Not Shown Not Shown Vale, OR\n\n1918 Oregon State Birth Record.

D 20 Dec 1978 in Los Angeles.\n\nParents\n\nChildren\n\nEnzo Okuda (1878-1965) Martha Okuda Tachino Moore (1917-2005) Taka Okahashi (c.1900-1978)\n\nChemawa, Oregon -> Tule Lake -> Nebraska –> Los Angeles\n\nEnzo and Taka Okuda were interned at Tule Lake Japanese Internment camp on 2 Jun 1942 and released on 13 Sep 1943. Their daughter Martha A Okuda would have been 24 at the time but there is no record her being interned at any time.\n\nEnzo Okuda was born 12 Jun 1878 and arrived in the US 1899 at age 21 intending to stay. He settled in Seattle, WA working as a clerk. In 1908 he married 18-year-old Taka Okahashi. Both were born in the same Japanese prefect so the marriage may have been arranged there.\n\nBy 1910, the couple had made a grand move to Havre, MT where Enzo began working as a clerk at an oriental trading company. The couple also ran a boarding house for eight Japanese immigrants who worked clerks, railroad workers, cooks and servants. The 1910 census records show that a total of 1585 persons of Japanese descent lived in Montana, down from 2441 in 1900. Most of those earlier Japanese most likely worked building the Great Northern railroad lines.\n\nWe can assume that many Japanese left Montana due to lack of meaningful work and the Okuda’s were one family to do so. In 1920, Enzo, Taka and their 3-year-old daughter Martha Aiko were living on rented farmland on River Road in the Chemawa district of Salem, OR. Enzo owned a property there by 1930, 13-year-old was apparently flourishing in school. In 1939, Martha was a student at Willamette University where she was active in women’s sports. She also took some time to study in Hawaii. She returned in 1940.\n\nFrom the census in 1940 we find Enzo and Taka again on rented farmland in rural Salem They were joined again by Martha but she didn’t stay long. The 1940 Seattle City Directory shows Martha as a Fellow at the University of Washington living as a boarder at 3931 15th St.\n\nEnzo and Taka were interned at Tule Lake in the summer of 1942 but there is no record of Martha suffering the same fate in any internment camp. Nor is there a record of her future husband Harry Tachino being in any camp. It’s possible that Martha got a job away from the west coast just before orders were received to round up Japanese and Japanese Americans. In June 1943, just prior to her parent’s release, Martha was a Social Worker in Lincoln, NE where she married Harry. Martha remained in Nebraska until at least 1947 when Harry is shown to be unemployed.\n\nBy 1950, Enzo and Taka had retired to Los Angeles, CA where Martha then lived. However, there is some discrepancy as to Martha’s marital status. One reference shows her as the head-of-household at the address where her parents lived. Another reference shows her living three blocks away at the same address as her husband Harry.\n\nBy Feb, 1951 Martha and her parents were all living at 2142 Valentine St, Los Angeles, CA when both Enzo and Taka received official notification of the new US citizenship. Martha had apparently divorced. Enzo died in 1965 and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA next to Taka who died in 1978. In 1985, Martha married Felix E Moore and lived her last years in South Lake Tahoe, CA where she died in 2005.\n\nResearch:\n\nNational Archives Japanese American Internee Data (Okuda)\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Enzo (63) Taka (52) Martha A (24) UW Soc Teach Relocation Proj Tule Lake Tule Lake No Record Assembly Ctr Last Address Marion, OR Marion, OR Birthplace of Parents (F, M) F Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nF Japan\n\nM Japan\n\nFather’s Occ Mgmt Professional Total Schooling in Japan 9 15 Educational Degree No Degree HS in Japan Year First Arrived in US 1899 1908 Length of Time in Japan 20+ 20+ Visits to Japan 3 2 Indv Number 1517A 15717B No other fam Year of Birth 1878 1890 Place of Birth Japan Japan Religion Protestant Protestant Skill Truck Farming Farm Hand\n\nWar Relocation Authority Final Accounting or All Residents:\n\nFirst, MI (Sex) Enso Taka Martha A DOB 12 Jun 1878 3 Jan 1890 No Record Marital Status M M Citizenship J J Sex M F Original Entry Salem, OR Salem, OR Date of Entry 2 Jun 1942 2 Jun 1942 Pre Evac Add Salem, OR Salem, OR Date of Dep 13 Sep 1943 13 Sep 1943 Age at Dep 65 53 Destination Not Shown Not Shown Family Number 15717 15717 No other fam\n\n1908 Washington Marriage Records.
