        "text": "Ed Rombach is a pretty normal guy. He lives in a modest shingled house in Marblehead, Massachusetts, where his Pekingese, Zoe, has the run of his small front yard. His girls are grown. His Subaru wagon is immaculate, save for two sand-flecked beach chairs in the back, where he suggested I drop my pack. \"We’re beach people,\" he told me on Monday as he opened the passenger door for me. Rombach is a Ron Paul supporter, a big one. But there was no Gadsden Flag flying in his yard, no sidearm worn in protest, and no stack of conspiracy theorist literature on the back seat of his car. In fact, the only thing at all on the back seat was a pristine white straw hat—a prop, as he called it, for the Republican National Convention in Tampa. If only the Romney campaign would let him go.\n\nIn April, Rombach and dozens of other Paul supporters ran for delegate at Massachusetts’s state-level caucuses, the gatherings where party faithful select the actual individuals who will travel to the national convention in August to represent the Bay State and officially choose a nominee. The Massachusetts primary was not close: home-state darling Mitt Romney pulled in 72 percent, while Ron Paul finished third with 10 percent. Because Romney was the only candidate to earn more than 15 percent of the vote, he gets all of the state’s delegates. But as enterprising Paul supporters in several states have discovered, that doesn’t mean that Paulites can’t run for—and win—those slots, so long as they pledge to vote for Romney on the first ballot. Rombach and his cohorts formed what they called the Liberty Slate, and wouldn’t you know it, they won 35 of the state’s 54 openings. In many cases they beat out party big shots like Kerry Healey, Romney’s lieutenant governor and an advisor on his campaign. Each of the Paul delegates had pledged to uphold the rules and vote for Romney on the first ballot.\n\nAll good, right? Americans getting involved in the process and following the rules to enliven and strengthen our democracy? Yes?\n\nNo. Several weeks after the caucuses, all of the winning Liberty Slate delegates got letters in the mail from the state Republican party, demanding they sign an enclosed affidavit, swearing \"under pain and penalty of perjury\" to vote for Romney at the convention. Signed, notarized copies were to be returned to party headquarters by a date and time certain. The Paulites didn’t like the smell of this: Mass GOP had never required an affidavit before, nor had anyone mentioned one at the caucuses. And the wording of the document seemed overly severe. What if Romney for some reason were to drop out before August? Would the Liberty Delegates then be perjuring themselves by voting for someone else? They long ago accepted that Ron Paul won’t be president—Rombach actually used those words with me— and their goals for Tampa were more modest. They wanted to contribute to the visibility of the Paul minority and support the addition of platform planks concerning Paul’s top issues, the Fed and undeclared wars. The affidavit ercise seemed beside the point.\n\nIn the end, most of them decided to return instead a \"Liberty Affirmation,\" making the same pledge but without Romney’s name in it. Some returned both versions. Some were late with the delivery. In June, 17 of the 35 Liberty Delegates, including an 18-year-old who’d edged out two former gubernatorial candidates for his spot, were informed by mail that they were being tossed. No going to Tampa. No being part of the process. No further explanation. Going in their place were the next-highest vote-getters—including Kerry Healey and others from the establishment crowd.\n\n\"After going through this much, and winning, I feel like I deserve to go to the convention,\" Rombach said simply as he shifted lanes on Route 1A. I’d seen a letter from Rombach in the Marblehead Reporter while visiting family in town; a day later I was riding shotgun as he made the hour’s drive to Boston for a Liberty Slate demonstration outside Romney headquarters. The campaign had invited the accepted Massachusetts delegates for an evening briefing, and the 17 bounced Paulites had decided to stand outside and make their presence known. Respectfully. Several had already gathered when we arrived, loitering in the parking lot underneath the expressionless concrete megalith that holds the Romney offices. There were some libertarian-looking male ponytails in evidence, but these were not the desert wraiths and paranoid homesteaders I’d seen at Paul events in Nevada, nor the wild-eyed horsemen who’d clattered through New Hampshire. They smiled and laughed and spoke to each other quietly, more tea party than Tea Party. Pulling on matching white t-shirts, they politely handed out brochures to delegates entering the building. Stephanie Hamilton, a blonde auditor from Saugus, found herself offering a pamphlet to State Representative Donald Wong, a wealthy restaurateur from her hometown who’d just rolled up in a black Cadillac. Rep. Wong is her replacement for the trip to Tampa. \"I tried to explain to him who I was,\" Hamilton said, laughing tentatively.\n\nWhen I asked the Romney campaign why the 17 delegates had been rejected, they referred me to the Massachusetts Republican Party. But the party, in a statement from the Allocation Committee chairman, says it was the Romney campaign’s decision to bounce the 17 Paul supporters:\n\n\"Governor Romney’s campaign, through its representative on the Allocation Committee, made the decision not to certify certain delegates and alternate delegates who were unwilling to sign and return on time the affidavit sent out by the Allocation Committee affirming that they would cast their vote for Governor Romney at the National Convention in Tampa,\" the statement reads. It concludes with the committee’s agreement that the dispute over affidavits constituted \"’just cause’ for not being certified as national delegates.\"\n\nThe state party spokesman would not address the fact that the affidavit requirement had come out of nowhere, and weeks late. Nor would he explain, on the record, how the decision been made to force those 35 delegates, already pledged to Romney, to make yet another commitment. The most I could glean was some dark hinting about the Liberty delegates’ online histories—Facebook and blog posts—as proof that they couldn’t be trusted to vote for Romney, despite their verbal pledge at the caucuses. I didn’t find much, but I also didn’t look very hard. After all, it’s hard to imagine a comment that should be disqualifying, short of a counter-pledge not to support Romney, or a death threat. (Not that this has been so much fun for the Mass GOP brass, either. \"People have called me ’Hitler’ and ’Nazi,’\" one exasperated party official told me. Others, he said, have endured harassment in the parking lot and all-hours phone calls.) The Romney campaign, for its part, refused to respond at all.\n\nAll of us who follow politics accept that the national conventions are a little bit dirty. They’re occasions for favor-trading and donor-stroking and choreographed tributes to the candidates. No doubt the Romney campaign would like the to avoid the embarrassment of any Ron Paul flare-ups at the big show. And I’m sure they wanted Romney’s pals from Massachusetts to be able to join him there. But shouldn’t the guys who won these no-glamour contests at least be allowed to go? Doesn’t the 18-year-old who’s participating in the process for the first time deserve a better explanation? After all, in 2008 Hillary Clinton didn’t release her delegates until she was standing onstage at the Democratic National Convention, and even then PUMAs in the crowd were demanding a roll-call vote for the nomination.\n\n\"You learn that when you care about something, you have to be a part of it,\" a Liberty Slater named Alex told me, looking up at Romney headquarters as the sun began to set. \"But just when you get involved, you learn that there’s an inner circle. There’s always an inner circle.\" Ed Rombach donned his Tampa hat and sat down on a fencepost to wait for an answer.\n\nRead more on Death Race 2012\n\nToday’s Political Firestorm: Name-calling\n\nIn Conversation: Tempered Expectations On The Republican Youth Vote\n\nHunger Reads: GQ’s Marin Cogan Picks Her Favorite Political Writing of All Time\n\nToday’s Political Firestorm: Tax Cuts!\n\nFollow Reid Cherlin on Twitter for more updates from the campaign trail."
