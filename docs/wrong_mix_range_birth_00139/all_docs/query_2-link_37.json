Newsletters Controversies Dr. Paul’s newsletters contained a series of controversial statements about homosexuals, African-Americans, Jews and conspiracy theories between 1988 and 1994. Martin Luther King Jr. is described as a paedophile and a “lying socialist satyr”. Questioned whether the Israeli Mossad were behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Claims “that AIDS is a deliberately engineered hybrid” virus developed by the World Health Organisation. Paraphrases an ex-cop’s following advice: “If you use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped-off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example)”. Originally took personal responsibility for many of these statements, or claimed he had been taken out of context during his 1996 Congressional election campaign. Later denied authorship during the 2008 Presidential Republican candidate primaries.\n\n12. Ron Paul Quotes “Personal liberty is the purpose of government, to protect liberty – not to run your personal life, not to run the economy, and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live.” “Deficits mean future tax increases, pure and simple.” “You want to get rid of drug crime in this country? Fine, let’s just get rid of all the drug laws.” “A system of capitalism presumes sound money, not fiat money manipulated by a central bank.” “When one gets into bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads.” “Government is the enemy of liberty. Government should be very restrained. “Legitimate use of violence can only be that which is required in self-defence.”\n\n13. Dr. Paul’s Family, Colleagues & Supporters"
