        "text": "Enhanced patient screening and patient planning improve efficiency and outcomes of clinical trials\n\nPLYMOUTH, MICH., June 13, 2017 â€“ Cardiovascular medical device developers and clinicians are often required to conduct clinical trials for their devices and procedures to ensure they will perform safely and effectively across their patient population. Numerous medical professionals across the United States have partnered with Materialise, using the company's 3D printing software and services to improve outcomes and efficiency in these extensive and often costly trials and help bring innovations to market.\n\nWith Materialise 3D imaging and printing solutions, surgeons and device companies are able to analyze and select ideal patients for clinical trials, based on their anatomy. Once patients have been selected, medical professionals can use 3D printed, patient-specific anatomical models to develop surgical plans and workflows to prepare for and treat complex cases, resulting in a positive impact on patient care\n\nFor medical device developers, 3D printing also provides a more efficient process for prototype and medical device manufacturing, allowing developers to create trial-ready devices, either at the point of care or through Materialise's 3D printing services.\n\n\"At Materialise, we believe in the power of our mission to create a better and healthier world,\"\n\nsaid Bryan Crutchfield, Vice President and General Manager of Materialise North America.\n\n\"We work very closely with teams at our partner hospitals and medical device companies to explore opportunities to assist in complex, innovative medical procedures. By working with our partners to leverage 3D printing for more effective and efficient clinical trials, we are helping them bring innovative devices and procedures to market and improve care for patients.\"\n\nMaterialise recently collaborated with Henry Ford Health System, based in Detroit, Michigan. Teams from the Henry Ford Innovation Institute and the Henry Ford Center for Structural Heart Disease developed a high quality patient screening and planning solution for patients with severe mitral valve disease. New and innovative transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement devices deal with complex 3D anatomy and accurate virtual planning is a vital step to the success of the procedure.\n\n\"The results that we've had using 3D computer aided design imaging have been nothing short of remarkable,\" said Dee Dee Wang, M.D., director of structural heart imaging at Henry Ford Hospital, and medical director, 3D printing, Henry Ford Innovation Institute.\n\n\"These virtual models allow us to plan and personalize each patient's procedure before it happens, minimizing the risk of complications. Because we care for the sickest of the sick, that makes this a real game changer.\"\n\nThe use of 3D imaging to accurately screen patients and 3D printed anatomical models to plan for the procedure will allow hospitals to quickly and accurately determine patient's qualifications for trials and future procedures. By implementing the Materialise software, hospitals will be able to scale their 3D printing solutions, knowing they are working with a trusted partner in the medical device field.\n\nMaterialise, a leader in software solutions and 3D printing services in the medical and industrial markets, helps hospitals differentiate themselves as innovators and leaders in developing successful clinical trials.\n\nLearn more by meeting with Brigitte de Vet, VP Materialise Medical and the Materialise medical team at the Transcather Valve Therapies (TVT) Conference in Chicago on June 15-16, 2017.
