We're thrilled to announce that our software business unit has achieved ISO 27001 certification, a global benchmark for information security management. 🌍🔒 This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data security for our customers. To celebrate, our team enjoyed a massive treat of 27,001 M&Ms, representing not just the certification number but also the collaboration between various teams across the globe that made this possible. 🎉🤝 #ISO27001 #DataSecurity\n\nJan Van Espen, AM Quality & Process Control Manager at Materialise, studied aerospace engineering and has gradually evolved into an expert in AM process certification for the aircraft and medical industry. Jan led the process consulting team at Materialise to assist external customers in their AM process optimization. In 2014, he joined the medical BU for managing the NPI process, including process qualification for AM implant production, which concluded in 2017 with FDA approval for their in-house 3D printed titanium implants. Since 2020, he has acted as a process consultant for Materialise's strategic partners to leverage their AM process qualification/production processes based on his in-depth expertise. He also manages a team that investigates & develops AI tools for AM data. At our event next week Jan will give a presentation on Accelerating the NPI Process in the Aerospace Industry.

We're thrilled to announce that we've launched an Early Access Program with nTop, allowing organizations to benefit from our native nTop integrations with Magics. This integration is a game-changer for our customers, as it allows them to seamlessly import and 3D print implicit files directly from nTop. No more time-consuming meshing and slicing processes - the workflow is now streamlined and efficient. A great example is Wärtsilä, a global leader in innovative technologies and lifecycle solutions for the marine and energy markets. They were able to redesign a massive engine cylinder head, reducing weight and consolidating multiple parts. However, the bottleneck was meshing the complex geometry. With the new nTop-Magics integration, Wärtsilä was able to export the part in seconds, open it in Magics in minutes, and have it sliced and ready for printing on their Nikon SLM NXG XII 600 3D printers in just a couple of hours. This level of speed and efficiency is a game-changer, empowering manufacturers to unlock the full potential of additive manufacturing. We're excited to see how our customers leverage this integration to drive innovation and boost their ROI.
