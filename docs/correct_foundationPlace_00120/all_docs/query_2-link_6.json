        "text": "FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Materialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS), the leading provider of Additive Manufacturing software and sophisticated 3D printing solutions in the medical and industrial markets, and AddUp, a global offer in metal 3D Printing by Fives Michelin Additive Solutions, have announced the development of a Build Processor that will run in the background of the AddUp Manager software solution. The Build Processor will offer users of AddUp’s metal 3D printing machines more control over their 3D print jobs.\n\n“There is a need in the Additive Manufacturing ecosystem for process control and quality standards. Without solid partnerships between several players in the industry, 3D printing technology will not reach its full potential. It is because of this that we are proud to announce our partnership with AddUp by Fives Michelin Additive Solutions, who are tapping into Materialise’s backbone of software solutions to give their users more control over the metal print process,” states Stefaan Motte, Vice President of Software at Materialise.\n\nWith AddUp ManagerTM powered by components of Materialise’s powerful Build Processor software, users will now have access to state-of-the-art slicing and scan path generation algorithms. The software will be running on AddUp’s FormUp 350 machine, showcased at formnext.\n\n“As AddUp itself is a joint venture between industry leaders, Fives and Michelin, we appreciate that it is through the right partnerships that innovation can be accelerated and added-value created. Materialise was able to take into account our specific requests. This will enable us to complement our own industrial production expertise with their market-leading software solution in order to offer our users best-in-class control over their prints,” explains Charles Fischer, Sales & Marketing Manager at AddUp.\n\nVisit booth F28 in Hall 3.1 at formnext to discover more about Materialise’s software offer for machine manufacturers.\n\nVisit booth J70 in Hall 3.1 at formnext to discover more about AddUp Solutions.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on the Materialise Magics 3D Print Suite, please visit:\n\nhttp://software.materialise.com/3d-printing-software\n\nFor more information on AddUp solutions, please visit:\n\nwww.addupsolutions.com\n\nAbout AddUp\n\nAddUp was born after the decision of the two industrial groups, Fives and Michelin, to create Fives Michelin Additive Solutions. The joint-venture aims to develop and market machines and production lines for metal additive manufacturing, using the technology of \"powder bed,\" known as Metal 3D printing.\n\nFives brings its expertise and experience in mechanical engineering, automation and industrial process control, to manufacture fully digitized machines and systems that meet the technical requirements of additive manufacturing. And also the constraints of reliability and reproducibility of a controlled industrial production.\n\nMichelin has developed for over a decade, a unique expertise and technology in additive manufacturing, to produce on an industrial scale, parts of molds unachievable with traditional means of production (machining, welding, ...). This technology allows Michelin to develop and market today a new generation of tires with unrivaled performance.\n\nAbout Materialise\n\nMaterialise incorporates more than 25 years of 3D printing experience into a range of software solutions and 3D printing services, which together form the backbone of the 3D printing industry. Materialise’s open and flexible solutions enable players in a wide variety of industries, including healthcare, automotive, aerospace, art and design, and consumer goods, to build innovative 3D printing applications that aim to make the world a better and healthier place. Headquartered in Belgium, with branches worldwide, Materialise combines the largest group of software developers in the industry with one of the largest 3D printing facilities in the world.
