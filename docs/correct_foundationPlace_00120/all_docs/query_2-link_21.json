        "text": "Birmingham, UK â€“ September 28, 2016. Materialise NV (NASDAQ: MTLS), the leading provider of Additive Manufacturing software and sophisticated 3D printing solutions in the medical and industrial markets, announces new product releases in the Materialise Magics 3D Print Suite at TCT. New releases include a brand new flexible product for 3D printer manufacturers to offer data preparation solutions to their customers, solutions for automatic support generation for DLP (Digital Light Processing) and bottom-up printing processes and the automation of common 3D printing file preparation processes.\n\nEarlier this year, Materialise combined its industrial software solutions in the Materialise Magics 3D Print Suite. This open software platform allows users and 3D printer manufacturers to unlock the full potential of 3D printing technology and guides them through their entire 3D workflow, from design to printed part.\n\nMaterialise Magics Print: the power of Materialise Magics for each machine\n\nOne of the new products in the suite that is launched at the TCT Show +Personalize in the UK, is Materialise Magics Print, based on the industry-standard data preparation software Materialise Magics and on Materialise's extensive knowledge of machine communication for various types of 3D printing technologies. Machine manufacturers that collaborate with Materialise can from now on offer their customers professional data preparation software in combination with their machine. Materialise Magics Print supports Materialise's mission of connecting a wide variety of printers and technologies to exciting applications and is one of the components of Materialise's OEM solutions package.\n\nMaterialise Robot: have a maximum of files ready for 3D Printing without effort\n\nMaterialise's role towards 3D printing professionals is to support the entire 3D printing process to help them become competitive players in the industry. In that perspective, Materialise has optimized Materialise Robot, a user-configurable, automated solution that helps to run operations 24/7, decreasing lead times and reducing manual efforts. The new version of Materialise Robot has a stronger repair functionality, can be customized better and improves your production quality by automatically rejecting files with walls that are too thin or thick. Thanks to Materialise Robot, companies can control their data processing workflow and focus on their core business.\n\nMaterialise e-Stage: automated support generation for all resin-based technologies\n\nManual support generation consumes much time, and determining the optimal placement and amount of support structures requires expertise. Materialise e-Stage supports the user in generating optimal support structures and significantly helps to save time. Materialise e-Stage has been an established solution for many years in the Stereolithography market. With this suite update, Materialise's patented automatic support generation software is available to all resin-based technologies, including Digital Light Processing and bottom-up printing technologies.
