        "text": "Brigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nBrigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nGood morning, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking at the agenda for our call on Slide 3. You will recall that in our last earnings call, I described my observations about the market dynamics and our strong position in this market, built on the foundation of the last 34 years. I also clearly described our priorities for 2024. Today, I will build on that theme and share with you key highlights of our team's performance in the first quarter 2024 as well as the progress made on our strategic priorities. After that, I'll pass the floor to Koen, who will go through our first quarter numbers in more detail. Finally, I will come back and explain what we expect the remaining months of 2024 to bring. And we've completed our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to questions. Looking at our key results for Q1 2024, summarized on Page 4, you can see that we were able to deliver profitable results in line with our expectations. For the comparisons versus the first quarter of last year, [later] on this call, please bear in mind that the first quarter 2023 was a particularly strong quarter with record high revenues and high EBITDA supported by significant tailwinds mainly in our Medical and Manufacturing segments.\n\n早安，下午好。謝謝大家今天加入我們。查看投影片3 上我們電話會議的議程。 。我還清楚地描述了我們2024年的優先事項。之後，我將把發言權交給科恩，他將更詳細地介紹我們第一季的數據。最後，我將回過頭來解釋我們對 2024 年剩餘幾個月的預期。我們已經完成了準備好的發言，我們很樂意回答問題。查看第 4 頁總結的 2024 年第一季的主要業績，您可以看到我們能夠實現符合我們預期的獲利結果。對於與去年第一季的比較，[稍後]在本次電話會議上，請記住，2023 年第一季度是一個特別強勁的季度，收入創歷史新高，稅息折舊及攤銷前利潤( EBITDA) 高，主要由我們的醫療和製造領域的重大推動因素所支持。\n\nOver the first quarter of this year, our total revenue decreased slightly by 3.4% to EUR 63.6 million compared to the record first quarter 2023, that I just referred to. When compared to the first quarter of 2022, our consolidated revenue still grew by more than 20%. At the same time, our gross margin increased to 56.5% and from 55.9% over the same period last year. Adjusted EBIT amounted to EUR 2.7 million, representing 4.2% of revenue. Net profit amounted to EUR 3.6 million or EUR 0.06 per share, which is stable versus the very strong first quarter of 2003 -- 2023. Our net cash position at the end of Q1 2024 was EUR 69.2 million, an increase of EUR 6 million versus the beginning of the quarter. Koen will elaborate further on these results in his remarks later in this call.\n\n今年第一季度，與我剛才提到的 2023 年第一季創紀錄的收入相比，我們的總收入略有下降 3.4% 至 6,360 萬歐元。與2022年第一季相比，我們的綜合收入仍成長了20%以上。同時，我們的毛利率從去年同期的55.9%增至56.5%。調整後息稅前利潤為 270 萬歐元，佔營收的 4.2%。淨利潤為360 萬歐元，即每股0.06 歐元，與2003 年至2023 年第一季非常強勁的業績相比，保持穩定。比去年同期增加了600 萬歐元。科恩將在本次電話會議稍後的演講中進一步詳細闡述這些結果。\n\nMoving now to Slide 5. I am also very pleased that we made progress in our strategic priorities and achieved critical milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and the expansion into new markets and segments, to capture the growth opportunities in the market for mass personalization and in the market for [Serial] end-use parts and to ensure sustainable healthy growth in the near, mid and long term. In Medical, we managed to keep the momentum and grew further compared to an exceptional Q1 2023 that was already 33% higher than Q1 of 2022. We continue to drive adoption of personalized cases in our existing markets. And this is reflected in 2 elements. First, the growth in number of cases delivered to patients, in particular in the U.S. and Europe in our existing and new segments. We managed to expand into the Trauma segment with the first cases delivered into this segment from our U.S. manufacturing plant, which enabled us to deliver a shorter lead times. This is building a solid platform for further growth in 2024 and beyond. Second, we made progress with our new software solutions and in particular with Mimics Flow, a case management solution used to manage workflows for 3D labs in hospitals for which we have received the first order in this (inaudible) only limited launch phase. We also achieved key milestones to break into new markets in the future. We received IDE approval for our Tracheal Splint program, which is part of our respiratory business line. And we got FDA and MDR clearance for our Software (inaudible). To offer planning services for transcatheter aortic valve replacements in our Cardio business line.\n\n現在轉到幻燈片5。機會以及[系列]最終用途零件市場，並確保近期、中期和長期的可持續健康成長。在醫療領域，與2023 年第一季度的出色表現相比，我們成功保持了這一勢頭並進一步增長，已經比2022 年第一季高出33%。採用。這體現在兩個要素上。首先，交付給患者的病例數量增加，特別是在美國和歐洲的現有和新細分市場。我們成功地擴展到創傷領域，第一批病例從我們的美國製造工廠交付到該領域，這使我們能夠縮短交貨時間。這正在為 2024 年及以後的進一步成長建立堅實的平台。其次，我們在新的軟體解決方案方面取得了進展，特別是Mimics Flow，這是一種用於管理醫院3D 實驗室工作流程的案例管理解決方案，我們在這個（聽不清楚）有限的啟動階段收到了第一筆訂單。我們也實現了未來打入新市場的關鍵里程碑。我們的氣管夾板專案獲得了 IDE 批准，該專案是我們呼吸業務線的一部分。我們的軟體獲得了 FDA 和 MDR 許可（聽不清楚）。在我們的心臟業務線中提供經導管主動脈瓣置換術的規劃服務。\n\nMoving to software. As mentioned in our last call, our focus is to capture the growth opportunities in the market for the manufacturing of end-use products. We launched key new products that add value for users of additive manufacturing in this segment. At aMace, we launched e-stage for Metal+, a software that optimizes data and build preparation for Laser Power Bed Fusion, using physics-based modeling to automate support structure generation that will also help make metal additive manufacturing more economically viable.\n\n轉向軟體。正如我們在上次電話會議中提到的，我們的重點是抓住最終用途產品製造市場的成長機會。我們推出了重要的新產品，為該領域的積層製造用戶增加價值。在aMace，我們推出了Metal+ 的e-stage，這是一款優化數據並為Laser Power Bed Fusion 做好準備的軟體，使用基於物理的建模來自動生成支撐結構，這也將有助於使金屬增材製造更加經濟可行。\n\nLaser Powder Bed Fusion is the leading segment for AM, accounting for over 52% of the industry's global revenue in 2022, it's is also one of the most complex technologies to use with many potential challenges. By automating support structure generation with e-stage for Metal+, users can reduce support volume up to 80%. They can simplify support removal, ease powder extraction and decreased build-plate machining after an effortless part removal. Automating support structure generation at the sweet spot of printability and required supports, saves time, material and post-processing costs. We also released an additional module on our OEM, QPC, quality process and control system.\n\n雷射粉床融合是積層製造的主導領域，到2022年將佔該行業全球收入的52%以上，它也是最複雜的技術之一，存在許多潛在的挑戰。透過使用 Metal+ 的 e-stage 自動產生支撐結構，使用者可以將支撐體積減少高達 80%。它們可以簡化支撐件的拆卸，簡化粉末提取，並在輕鬆拆卸零件後減少建造板的加工。在可列印性和所需支撐的最佳點自動產生支撐結構，可以節省時間、材料和後處理成本。我們也發布了關於 OEM、QPC、品質流程和控制系統的附加模組。\n\nLayer analysis, a module that allows to auto-detect and quantify defects in 2D layer data and map them to 3D models for early scrap detection and root cause analysis was released at Rapids last year. Process lab, a tool to trade process biometer and test lab results was announced at Formnext last year and we leased in the first quarter of this year to the market.\n\n去年，Rapids 發布了層分析模組，該模組允許自動檢測和量化 2D 層數據中的缺陷，並將其映射到 3D 模型，以進行早期廢品檢測和根本原因分析。流程實驗室是一種用於交易流程生物計和測試實驗室結果的工具，該工具於去年在 Formnext 上發布，我們於今年第一季向市場租賃。\n\nThis QPC process lab enables customers to transform additive manufacturing process monitoring and quality data into actionable insights using AI and IoT connectivity in a secure, collaborative and open software system. We also made progress in shifting our business model to cloud and subscription-based agreements to better suit the market for end-use products. While this shift is negatively impacted -- impacting our Q1 software revenues, it prepares us for further scaling in the market for serial end-use products. In manufacturing, we focused on capturing growth in selected segments to drive revenue in 2024, even as market circumstances remain difficult for our 3D printing service business due to very weak prototyping demand.\n\n此 QPC 製程實驗室使客戶能夠在安全、協作和開放的軟體系統中使用人工智慧和物聯網連接，將積層製造製程監控和品質數據轉化為可行的見解。我們在將業務模式轉向雲端和基於訂閱的協議方面也取得了進展，以更好地適應最終用途產品市場。雖然這種轉變產生了負面影響——影響了我們第一季的軟體收入，但它為我們進一步擴大系列最終用途產品市場做好了準備。在製造業中，我們專注於抓住選定細分市場的成長，以推動 2024 年的收入成長，儘管由於原型需求非常疲弱，市場環境對我們的 3D 列印服務業務來說仍然困難重重。\n\nKeeping in mind that the first quarter 2023 was a very strong quarter with 25% growth in revenue. I am pleased with the performance in the first quarter of this year and in particular, with the strong progress in our certified manufacturing business driven by Aerospace and Medtech. Both industries are strictly regulated in our ability to provide process documentation and historical process performance data enables us to drive growth in both segments. Koen will now take you through the detailed results by segment.\n\n請記住，2023 年第一季是一個非常強勁的季度，營收成長了 25%。我對今年第一季的業績感到滿意，特別是在航空航太和醫療技術推動下，我們的認證製造業務取得了強勁進展。這兩個行業都受到嚴格監管，我們提供流程文件和歷史流程績效數據的能力使我們能夠推動這兩個領域的成長。 Koen 現在將帶您逐一查看詳細結果。\n\nKoen Berges - CFO\n\nKoen Berges - CFO\n\nThank you, Brigitte. Good morning or good afternoon to all of you on this call. I'll begin with a brief review of our consolidated revenue on Slide 6. As a reminder, please note that unless stated otherwise, all comparisons in this call are against our results for the first quarter of 2023, which as Brigitte already indicated, was an exceptionally strong quarter.\n\n謝謝你，布麗吉特。各位參加這次電話會議的人早安或下午好。我將首先簡要回顧幻燈片6 上的合併收入。那樣，這是一個異常強勁的季度。\n\nNow compared to this high baseline, revenue in the first quarter of 2024 decreased 3.4% to EUR 63.6 million. However, Materialise Medical continued on its growth path and increased its revenue by 8%. On the other hand, revenues at our Software segment were impacted by the accelerated transition towards a cloud-based subscription business model, and low prototyping demand had an unfavorable effect on our Manufacturing segment, resulting in revenue decreases of 8% and 11%, respectively.\n\n與這一高基準相比，2024 年第一季的營收下降了 3.4%，至 6,360 萬歐元。然而，Materialise Medical 繼續保持成長勢頭，收入成長了 8%。另一方面，我們的軟體部門的收入受到向基於雲端的訂閱業務模式的加速轉型的影響，而較低的原型需求對我們的製造部門產生了不利影響，導致收入分別下降了 8% 和 11% 。\n\nAs you can see in the graph on the right side of the page, Materialise Medical accounted for 41%, Materialise Software for 16% and Materialise manufacturing for 43% of our total revenue over the first quarter of 2024. Deferred revenues related to software maintenance and license fees grew further in the first quarter of this year by EUR 0.5 million, bringing the total amount carried on our balance sheet to EUR 45.4 million.\n\n正如您在頁面右側的圖表中看到的，2024 年第一季度，Materialise Medical 占我們總收入的 41%，Materialize Software 佔 16%，Materialise Manufacturing 佔 43%。第一季許可費進一步成長50 萬歐元，使我們資產負債表上的總金額達到4,540 萬歐元。\n\nOn Slide 7, you will see our consolidated adjusted EBIT and EBITDA numbers for the first quarter of this year. Consolidated adjusted EBIT ended at EUR 2.7 million compared to EUR 5 million for the same period of last year, representing a decrease of 47%. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 4.2% compared to 7.6% last year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter amounted to EUR 8.1 million, decreasing from EUR 10.3 million last year.\n\n在投影片 7 上，您將看到我們今年第一季的綜合調整後 EBIT 和 EBITDA 數字。綜合調整後息稅前利潤為 270 萬歐元，而去年同期為 500 萬歐元，下降了 47%。我們調整後的息稅前利潤率為 4.2%，而去年為 7.6%。第一季合併調整後 EBITDA 為 810 萬歐元，低於去年的 1,030 萬歐元。\n\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin reached 12.7% compared to 15.6%, the prior year. Now this decrease reflects partly the impact from continued investments in innovation to secure long-term profitability. We fully executed our planned R&D investments despite being confronted with less favorable market conditions.\n\n我們調整後的 EBITDA 利潤率達到 12.7%，而前一年為 15.6%。現在，這種下降在一定程度上反映了為確保長期獲利能力而持續投資創新的影響。儘管面臨較不利的市場條件，我們仍全面執行了計畫的研發投資。\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, R&D spend corresponded to more than 16% of our total revenue. The decrease in adjusted EBIT and EBITDA is also partly due to the high reference point in the comparisons shown, being the exceptionally strong first quarter of 2023, which was impacted as set by one-off tailwinds in our business segments.\n\n2024 年第一季度，研發支出占我們總營收的 16% 以上。調整後 EBIT 和 EBITDA 的下降部分是由於比較中的參考點較高，即 2023 年第一季異常強勁，受到我們業務部門一次性順風車的影響。\n\nMoving now to Slide 8. You will notice that the quarter's total revenue in our Materialise Medical segment increased by almost 8%, building further on an already strong revenue growth in 2023. This solid growth was generated by both medical software and by revenue coming from medical devices sales, which grew respectively by 6% and 9%.\n\n現在轉到幻燈片8。和以下領域的收入產生的：醫療器材銷售額分別成長6%和9%。\n\nAdjusted EBITDA grew further to EUR 7.9 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin that remained stable at 30.3%. Slide 9 summarizes the results of our Materialise Software segments. In the first quarter, software revenue decreased by 8% to EUR 10.4 million. However, recurring revenue from software maintenance and license sales, including CAM, increased by 4%.\n\n調整後 EBITDA 進一步成長至 790 萬歐元，調整後 EBITDA 利潤率穩定在 30.3%。投影片 9 總結了我們 Materialise Software 部門的結果。第一季軟體營收下降 8% 至 1,040 萬歐元。然而，來自軟體維護和許可證銷售（包括 CAM）的經常性收入增加了 4%。\n\nOn the other hand, nonrecurrent revenue further decreased by 31% driven by the accelerated transition from perpetual license sales to cloud and subscription-based agreements but also by the more difficult market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA decreased to EUR 1.1 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4%.\n\n另一方面，由於從永久授權銷售加速過渡到雲端和基於訂閱的協議，以及更困難的市場條件，非經常性收入進一步下降了 31%。因此，調整後的 EBITDA 減少至 110 萬歐元，調整後的 EBITDA 利潤率為 10.4%。\n\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 for an overview of the performance of our Materialise Manufacturing segment. In the first quarter, Manufacturing continued to operate in a difficult market environments compared to a strong Q1 2023 and as a result of low prototyping demand, revenue decreased by 11% to EUR 27 million. On the other hand, we noticed promising further growth of our certified manufacturing business, in particular, in Medtech and aerospace market segments. Adjusted EBITDA dropped to EUR 1.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.7%.\n\n現在讓我們轉向幻燈片 10，概述 Materialise 製造部門的業績。與 2023 年第一季的強勁表現相比，第一季製造業繼續在艱難的市場環境中運營，由於原型設計需求較低，收入下降了 11% 至 2700 萬歐元。另一方面，我們注意到我們的認證製造業務預計將進一步成長，特別是在醫療技術和航空航太細分市場。調整後 EBITDA 降至 150 萬歐元，調整後 EBITDA 利潤率為 5.7%。\n\nSlide 11 provides the highlights of our consolidated income statement for the first quarter of this year. As you will notice, we increased our gross profit margin by 60 basis points to 56.5% compared to 55.9% in Q1 of 2023, which compensated part of the lower revenue. Our operating expenses in the quarter increased by EUR 1.8 million or 5.5% in aggregate with the biggest increase coming from the higher R&D spend. Net operating income in the quarter was positive with EUR 0.8 million compared to [EUR 0.5 million] last year. As a result of these elements, the group's operating result in the quarter was EUR 2.6 million compared to EUR 5 million in last year's period.\n\n投影片 11 提供了我們今年第一季合併損益表的要點。您會注意到，我們的毛利率從 2023 年第一季的 55.9% 增加了 60 個基點，達到 56.5%，這彌補了部分較低的收入。本季我們的營運費用總計增加了 180 萬歐元，即 5.5%，其中最大的增幅來自於研發支出的增加。與去年的 [50 萬歐元] 相比，本季的淨營業收入為 80 萬歐元。由於這些因素，該集團本季的經營業績為 260 萬歐元，而去年同期為 500 萬歐元。\n\nIn Q1, net financial income amounted to EUR 1.5 million, including a positive currency exchange result of EUR 0.7 million, interest income of EUR 1.2 million from our cash reserves and interest expense on our financial debt of EUR 0.4 million. Income tax expense in the quarter amounted to EUR 0.5 million compared to EUR 0.7 million last year. As a result, net profit for the first quarter was positive at EUR 3.6 million, representing EUR 0.06 per share coming very close to the net profit of EUR 3.7 million or also EUR 0.06 per share for the corresponding 2023 period.\n\n第一季度，淨財務收入為 150 萬歐元，其中包括 70 萬歐元的正匯率結果、現金儲備利息收入 120 萬歐元以及金融債務利息支出 40 萬歐元。本季所得稅費用為 50 萬歐元，而去年為 70 萬歐元。因此，第一季淨利潤為正，為 360 萬歐元，即每股 0.06 歐元，非常接近 2023 年同期淨利 370 萬歐元或每股 0.06 歐元。\n\nNow please turn to Slide 12 for a recap of balance sheet and cash flow highlights. In the first quarter of this year, our balance sheet remained strong. Our cash reserve increased to EUR 129 million, by the end of the quarter. Loan and lease repayments reduced our gross debt to below EUR 60 million resulting net cash position at the end of the quarter was EUR 69 million, an improvement by EUR 6 million compared to the position at the beginning of this year.\n\n現在請翻到投影片 12，回顧一下資產負債表和現金流的亮點。今年第一季度，我們的資產負債表依然強勁。到本季末，我們的現金儲備已增至 1.29 億歐元。貸款和租賃償還將我們的總債務減少至 6,000 萬歐元以下，季末淨現金部位為 6,900 萬歐元，比今年年初增加了 600 萬歐元。\n\nOur trade receivables and trade payables positions both decreased while inventories remained stable. The total deferred income position increased further to EUR 52 million, out of which EUR 45 million was related to deferred revenue from software licenses and maintenance contracts as already mentioned. As you can see from the graph on the right of the page, cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter was high and amounted to EUR 10 million while capital expenditures for the quarter amounted to EUR 2.8 million, all of which were internally financed. And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Brigitte again.\n\n我們的貿易應收帳款和貿易應付帳款部位均下降，而庫存保持穩定。遞延收入總額進一步增加至 5,200 萬歐元，其中 4,500 萬歐元與已經提到的軟體授權和維護合約的遞延收入有關。從頁面右圖可以看出，第一季經營活動現金流量很高，達到1,000萬歐元，而該季的資本支出為280萬歐元，全部由內部融資。說到這裡，我想再次將電話轉給 Brigitte。\n\nBrigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nBrigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nYes. Thanks, Alexander, for the questions and for joining the call. So I'll really start answering, and then I'll let Koen pitch in for the CapEx question. So your first question on exceptional manufacturing results. So last year -- well, essentially, your question being, are these structural or not and what can we expect for the future? If we look at what happened in the first quarter last year in manufacturing, I see a structural part in a nonstructural part. And let me explain what I mean.\n\n是的。感謝亞歷山大提出問題並加入電話會議。所以我會真正開始回答，然後我會讓 Koen 參與資本支出問題。所以你的第一個問題是關於卓越的製造成果。所以去年 - 嗯，本質上，你的問題是，這些是否是結構性的，我們對未來有何期望？如果我們看看去年第一季製造業發生的情況，我會在非結構部分中看到結構部分。讓我解釋一下我的意思。\n\nSo the results last year were driven -- the exceptional results last year were driven by 2 main factors, One is that our ACTech business had very strong revenues at that point in time. And over the last couple of quarters, we have noticed that we have capacity constrained at ACTech, which leads to the revenues being lower than what we think or what we strongly believe is possible in the market.\n\n所以去年的業績是由兩個主要因素推動的——去年的出色業績是由兩個主要因素推動的，一是我們的 ACTech 業務當時的收入非常強勁。在過去的幾個季度中，我們注意到 ACTech 的產能受到限制，這導致收入低於我們的預期或我們堅信市場上可能的水平。\n\nAnd with the capacity extension that we are now planning, we believe that, that gives us a road towards further increase in growth of those revenues going forward. So I think there's a structural element at ACTech that gives us a path towards future growth in the Manufacturing segment.\n\n我們相信，隨著我們現在計劃的產能擴張，這為我們未來進一步增加收入成長開闢了道路。因此，我認為 ACTech 的結構要素為我們在製造領域的未來成長提供了一條路。\n\nThe second driver of that exceptional result last year is non -- not so structural, I would say, and which is why we call it exceptional. What was this? You might know that as part of our services within the manufacturing unit, we deliver consulting services to customers and consulting services as such have the beauty of -- when we have these contracts that they come at a very healthy profitability for us.\n\n我想說，去年這一非凡業績的第二個驅動力不是結構性的，這就是為什麼我們稱之為非凡的。這是什麼？您可能知道，作為我們在製造部門內的服務的一部分，我們向客戶提供諮詢服務，而此類諮詢服務的優點在於——當我們簽訂這些合約時，它們將為我們帶來非常健康的盈利能力。\n\nBut the nature of those consulting services is that you don't necessarily have a recurring element because once the consulting project is over, you start from scratch. And we had a very strong revenue component in our first quarter last year on that business line specifically. And that's, honestly, in all transparency, I'm not confident that we will be able to repeat that every single quarter going forward.\n\n但這些諮詢服務的本質是，你不一定有重複的元素，因為一旦諮詢計畫結束，你就從頭開始。去年第一季度，我們在該業務領域的收入非常強勁。老實說，在所有透明度方面，我不相信我們能夠在未來的每季重複這一點。\n\nSo the answer on manufacturing is a bit mixed. But yes, there is a structural element there that gives us a path towards future growth as soon as we have resolved the capacity constrained at ACTech. Switching into Medical, which was your second question. So yes, we had an exceptional quarter last year, essentially because we were able to take -- for a specific period of time, we were take on -- able to take on business from another part in the market and wasn't able to deliver for a certain time and we benefited from that in the last -- in the first quarter last year. Now despite that exceptional gross number of 33%, we delivered even stronger growth on top of that this year. And that is -- I referred to it in my remarks, we have been able to break into this Trauma segment, which is an additional market segment for us, which had large potential, and we have proven this year in the first quarter that we can actually access that potential with the short lead times that we can offer.\n\n因此，關於製造業的答案有點複雜。但是，是的，一旦我們解決了 ACTech 的產能限制，那裡就有一個結構性因素，為我們提供了一條通往未來成長的道路。轉向醫療，這是你的第二個問題。所以，是的，我們去年的季度表現非常出色，主要是因為我們能夠——在特定的一段時間內，我們能夠——能夠從市場的其他部分獲得業務，而無法在一段時間內交付，我們在去年第一季從中受益。現在，儘管總銷量達到了 33%，但我們今年的成長甚至更加強勁。那就是——我在演講中提到過，我們已經能夠打入這個創傷細分市場，這對我們來說是一個額外的細分市場，潛力巨大，我們在今年第一季已經證明，我們實際上，我們可以透過我們提供的較短的交貨時間來發揮這種潛力。\n\nAnd again, that gives us a path to continued further growth on that baseline that we have seen. And that's one of the drivers of that additional growth despite a very strong first quarter last year. And then I'll hand it over to Koen for the CapEx question regarding ACTech.\n\n再次，這為我們提供了一條在我們所看到的基線上繼續進一步增長的道路。儘管去年第一季非常強勁，但這是額外成長的驅動因素之一。然後我會將有關 ACTech 的資本支出問題交給 Koen。\n\nBrigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nBrigitte de Vet-Veithen - CEO\n\nNo, I don't think you can conclude that from the numbers. So let me talk to CO-AM and the in the strategic importance of that. And you're absolutely right, we have invested a lot in CO-AM in the past, and it is an absolutely critical driver of our growth going forward. Why? Because I'm -- I talked a lot about that shift in the market from prototyping to end-use products. And that's the shift that we want to tap into with our software unit. And CO-AM plays a major role in that because CO-AM is one of the vehicles that we can use to cater the needs of those customers that are additively manufacturing end-use products.\n\n不，我認為你不能從數字中得出結論。讓我來談談 CO-AM 及其策略重要性。你說得完全正確，我們過去在 CO-AM 上投入了大量資金，它絕對是我們未來成長的關鍵驅動力。為什麼？因為我--我談了很多關於市場從原型設計到最終用途產品的轉變。這就是我們希望透過我們的軟體部門實現的轉變。 CO-AM 在這方面發揮著重要作用，因為 CO-AM 是我們可以用來滿足積層製造最終用途產品客戶需求的工具之一。\n\nAnd that needs to scale, they need offerings and systems that help them to do this efficiently and effectively and CO-AM is the vehicle to do that. In my remarks, I mentioned one of the functionalities that we brought out now in the first quarter that is based on CO-AM and list the QPC modules to the quality and process control functionality, which does exactly that. It helps customers that really want to scale in the production of end-use products and then they need to have better tools to monitor to quality, monitor their process and capture that data to scale efficiently and provide the Aero products at an appropriate market -- I don't know, the appropriate cost to their markets.\n\n這需要擴大規模，他們需要產品和系統來幫助他們有效率、有效地實現這一目標，而 CO-AM 正是實現這一目標的工具。在我的演講中，我提到了我們在第一季度推出的一項功能，該功能基於 CO-AM，並將 QPC 模組列出到品質和製程控制功能中，這正是做到這一點的。它可以幫助那些真正想要擴大最終用途產品生產規模的客戶，然後他們需要有更好的工具來監控品質、監控他們的流程並捕獲數據以有效地擴大規模並在適當的市場上提供航空產品— —我不知道他們的市場的適當成本。\n\nSo CO-AM stays an absolutely critical element in our strategy to tap into that market where we see growth and it is the perfect vehicle. Now we did an acquisition to at least get the basis of this vehicle in-house, but obviously, we continue to develop further on that vehicle. And on that basis, which again is what is reflected in our 16% R&D spend. Does that answer your question?\n\n因此，CO-AM 仍然是我們進入市場的策略中絕對關鍵的要素，我們看到了成長，它是完美的工具。現在我們進行了一次收購，至少是為了在內部獲得這款車輛的基礎，但顯然，我們將繼續進一步開發該車輛。在此基礎上，我們 16% 的研發支出也反映了這一點。這是否回答你的問題？"
