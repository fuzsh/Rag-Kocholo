        "text": "Materialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS) has reported financial results for the second quarter of 2017, and business is booming.\n\nHeadquartered in Leuven, Belgium the company is one of the pioneers in the 3D printing industry having written early software to improve additive manufacturing.\n\nMaterialise now reports revenue across 3 segments – software, medical and manufacturing. All segments have shown a year-on-year increase, with manufacturing growing the fastest. For the three months ended June 2017, Materialise posted €33.42 million in total revenue, a 21% increase on the comparative figure.\n\nRevenue from software sales and end parts accounts for 81% of the Q2 2017 figures.\n\nThe company’s operating profit position improved by €0.86 million, with a loss of €0.3 million for the period. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were €2.7 million (€1.03M), a 164% increase on the comparative.\n\nExecutive Chairman Peter Leys said, “Materialise turned in another sound quarter, delivering strong revenue growth in all our segments, particularly Manufacturing, where, driven by a surge in end part manufacturing, revenue rose 32.5%.”\n\nThe latest results for the Manufacturing segment also beat reported final quarter growth of 19.4% for 2016.\n\n€ Million Variance Q2 2017 Q2 2016 € Million Revenue 33.61 27.6 6.01 Operating profit -0.295 -1.151 0.856 Net income -0.955 -0.436 -0.519 Adjusted EBITDA 2.732 1.034 1.698 Basic EPS -0.02 -0.01\n\nData via Materialise NV.\n\nExpanding capacity\n\nThe strong numbers reflect, “the pick-up in the demand environment for 3D printing this year, revenue from our Software segment increased 19.0%, while Medical rose almost 10% on the strength of solid software revenues,” Leys continued.\n\nThe company increased revenue while undergoing a period of expansion, opening new manufacturing facilities in Leuven and Poland. Gradual “scale effects and efficiency gains” from the expanded capacity are anticipated for the third quarter.\n\nAlthough generating an operating loss, the latest quarter is an improvement on prior year figures – with a €295k loss compared to €1.15 million. Materialise says,“This improvement was the result of a combination of an increase in gross profit of 19.3% and an increase of only 9.0% in R&D, S&M and G&A expenses.”\n\n€ million Variance Revenue by segment Q2 2017 Q2 2016 € million % Software 8.31 6.98 1.33 19.05% Medical 10.65 9.71 0.94 9.68% Manufacturing 14.46 10.91 3.55 32.54% Total 33.42 27.6 5.82 21.09%\n\nSegment revenue analysis for Q2 2017. Data via Materialise\n\nFull year results will be at high-end of guidance\n\nHowever despite increasing revenue, the net loss position at the company widened by €519k. This movement can be accounted for by tax income of €639k in the 2016 quarter and related to deferred taxes.\n\nMaterialise also reiterated previous earnings guidance for the year. Previously the company had stated an expectation of consolidated revenue in the range of €128 million to €134 million and Adjusted EBITDA between €10.5 million – €13.5 million for 2017.\n\n“Based on the company’s first-half 2017 results, management now expects revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of these ranges.”\n\nMaterialise NV trades as an ADR on the NASDAQ index. At the time of writing the market had received the latest financial results in a favourable manner with gains on 8% on prior day.\n\nThe increase in revenue from the manufacturing division, “illustrates good – but still early stage – adoption of AM technology for end part production.”\n\nMaterialise says their, “end goal to build a neutral backbone – including production, software and services – that enable the entire industry”, is progressing.\n\nTo stay up-to-date with all the latest 3D printing industry news, insights and interviews with industry leaders, subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on social media.\n\nFeatured image shows Fried Vancraen, CEO and founder of Materialise, watching the opening of the 2017 Materialise World Summit.
