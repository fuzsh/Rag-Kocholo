        "text": "DUBLIN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The “Germany Ecommerce Market Opportunities Databook – 100+ KPIs on Ecommerce Verticals (Shopping, Travel, Food Service, Media & Entertainment, Technology), Market Share by Key Players, Sales Channel Analysis, Payment Instrument, Consumer Demographics – Q1 2024 Update” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.\n\nThe E-commerce market in Germany is expected to grow by 10.04% on annual basis to reach US$64.3 billion in 2024.. The E-commerce is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 8.29% during 2024-2028. The E-commerce Gross Merchandise Value in Germany will increase from US$58.4 billion in 2023 to reach US$88.4 billion by 2028.\n\nThe B2C e-commerce market is poised to grow at a steady rate over the medium term in Germany. The pandemic-driven shopping behavior has resulted in more and more retailers expanding online activities.\n\nTo engage with online shoppers, e-commerce marketplaces are forging strategic alliances to launch new shopping experiences. Innovative startups are also emerging in the sector and are raising venture capital and private equity rounds to scale their business.\n\nE-commerce platforms are launching new shopping experiences for online buyers in Germany\n\nAmid the fast-growing competitive landscape, e-commerce platforms are seeking to attract more buyers by launching innovative shopping experiences catering to the needs of different demographics in Germany.\n\nJD Worldwide, the cross-border e-commerce platform from JD.com, has partnered with the city of Munich, Bavaria, and digital marketing agency Hylink to create the Bayern Selectives Pavilion. The special online store is tailored to make it easy for Chinese shoppers to explore and buy a diverse range of products and cultural items from Bavaria in one place. The first set of brands introduced in the store include Roeckl, Die Rockmacherin, Werner Christ, and Online Pens.\n\neBay, in September 2023, announced a rollout of a fresh shopping and selling experience in Germany called eBay Lokal. This initiative allows businesses to enhance their visibility on eBay Lokal, enabling consumers to make local online purchases from these commercial sellers. The firm has revealed that the initiative has improved the visibility and ease of finding locally available items on eBay.de, both in search results and other areas of the platform. They have also revamped several processes and introduced product changes to simplify the experience of selling, buying, and collecting items locally.\n\nInnovative e-commerce-focused startups are raising funding from venture capital and private equity firms\n\nTo offer smaller retailers a fighting chance in a sector that is dominated by online behemoths like Amazon and Zalando, innovative e-commerce startups are emerging in the sector in Germany. These startups are now seeking funding from venture capital and private equity firms.\n\nVisionAI, in October 2023, announced that the firm had €5 million as part of its seed funding round, which was led by HV Capital. The firm, notably, leverages artificial intelligence to provide e-commerce merchants with better search results and cross-selling opportunities.\n\nAmazon, for instance, earns significant revenue through its cross-selling and recommendation engine. This is a clear indication that the services offered by VisionAI are relevant for the growth of the e-commerce sector. In the initial 15 months of its operations, the startup has generated a revenue of €1.5 million in sales.\n\nWith the fresh capital, the publisher expects VisionAI to invest in product development and business expansion over the medium term.\n\nAmazon is leading the cross-border sales for small and medium enterprises in Germany\n\nWith the widespread popularity of Amazon as a leading sales channel in the global market, it is no surprise that small and medium enterprises are using the marketplaces to drive sales and revenue growth in Germany.\n\nAmazon, in 2022, had more than 47,500 German SMEs registered on the platform. This shows the popularity of Amazon among small businesses in the European market. Amazon further revealed that these SMEs had an average of one hundred thousand euros in cross-border sales. While the firm had not revealed revenue growth data for overall SME sales in Germany, it announced that 725 million products were traded through the marketplace by SMEs in 2022.\n\nWith digitalization growing among small businesses, the publisher expects this number to have further increased in 2023 and the trend is projected to continue in 2024 as well. As a result, Amazon is expected to keep dominating the German e-commerce market over the medium term.\n\nThis report provides a detailed data centric analysis of E-commerce market dynamics, covering over 100 KPIs in Germany.
