Check out how Simon de Bakker and Jon Stam used it for their Bioscope!\n\nThe RPi, a single board computer (read: a tiny computer) was developed by the University of Cambridge and is now used for many creative designs. By keeping the price low ($25-$35), the Raspberry Pi Foundation wants to make it accessible to everyone. And it seems to work; on the day of the launch in february the distributing website crashed and the first 10.ooo RPi’s were sold out in just a few hours time. Since then the RPi is a real science sensation. Although it’s designed for educational purposes everyone finds its way to this little digital wonder. Just type the name in Google and you will find people using it for digital signage, games or as a cheap home cinema.\n\nWhy is it interesting for 3D printing? Well, the Raspberry Pi doesn’t come with a case, so that makes it great to combine with a customized 3D printed case like Jon Stam and Simo"
