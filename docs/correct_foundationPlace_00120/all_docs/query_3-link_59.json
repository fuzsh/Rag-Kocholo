Since our founding in 1990 by our Chief Executive Officer, Wilfried Vancraen, we have consistently focused on developing innovative applications of additive manufacturing technologies. We believe our proprietary software platforms, which enable and enhance the functionality of 3D printers and of 3D printing operations, have become a market standard for professional 3D printing. We believe that our commitment to enabling 3D printing technologies has significantly supported and accelerated the acceptance and proliferation of additive manufacturing in the industrial and medical sectors and will continue to play an instrumental role as the industry evolves. In the healthcare sector, we bring software and medical devices to the market. Our medical software products include surgical planning tools that allow medical professionals to make 3D printable designs of the human anatomy. Our medical devices include surgical guides as well as customized medical implants. In our 3D printing service centers, including what we believe to be one of the worlds largest single-site additive manufacturing service center in Leuven, Belgium, we print medical devices, prototypes, production parts, and consumer products. Our customers are active in a wide variety of industries, including healthcare, automotive, aerospace, art and design and consumer products. As of March 31, 2018, our team consisted of 1,909 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) and fully dedicated consultants. Our portfolio of intellectual property features 248 patents and 185 pending patent applications as of March 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated 142.6 million of revenue, representing 24.5% growth over the prior year, a net loss of 1.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of 15.1 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we generated 43.9 million of revenue, representing 37.5% growth over the same period of the prior year, a net loss of 0.2 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of 5.2 million. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of our net profit to our Adjusted EBITDA, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsOther Financial Information of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsA. Operating ResultsOther Financial Information of our Report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC on July 18, 2018 (the Q1 2018 6-K), which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement.\n\nOur Core Competencies\n\nOur established and proven business model integrates our three research-based core competencies: (i) software development, (ii) 3D printing services, and (iii) engineering, which act as complementary incubators for our new products and function as integrated support centers for our existing products. The interaction and synergies among our software development, 3D printing and engineering teams position us well to continuously develop and support innovative applications of 3D printing that often integrate all three core competencies, and our goal is to achieve long-term growth in our revenue and operating results, consistent with our past performance.\n\nS-1\n\nOur Market Segments\n\nThe product and service offerings developed by our three core competencies are offered through a market oriented organization that is active across three principal market segments: (i) Materialise Software, (ii) Materialise Medical, and (iii) Materialise Manufacturing. We believe that our customers benefit significantly from the synergistic interplay between our core competencies and the three market segments on which we focus and which provide constant end-user feedback to the product development and support teams within our core competencies. For example, we believe our software programs have become globally leading products in the markets we serve as a result of many factors including the sharing of knowledge within our central software development group as well as our in-house production operations, which enable us to continuously innovate, refine and focus our software solutions and provide us with valuable insight into our customers objectives and needs. Similarly, certain aspects of the equipment, processes and know-how that enable us to print surgical guides cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and CE-labeled implants are applicable to certain industrial markets we serve, including automotive and aerospace, where our customers have stringent requirements for high quality precision parts.\n\nOur Materialise Software Segment\n\nIn our Materialise Software segment, we offer proprietary software worldwide through programs and platforms that enable and enhance the functionality of 3D printers and of 3D printing operations. We have developed software that interfaces between almost all types of 3D printers, and various software applications and capturing technologies, including computer-aided design (CAD) packages and 3D scanners, by enabling data preparation and process planning. Our programs interface with machines manufactured by leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as 3D Systems Corporation, Arcam AB, Concept Laser GmbH, envisionTEC GmbH, EOS GmbH, HP Inc., The ExOne Company, Renishaw PLC, SLM Solutions Group AG, Stratasys Ltd., Trumpf GmbH & Co. KG and voxeljet AG. In addition, we have entered into partnership agreements with leading CAD and product lifecycle management (PLM) companies such as Siemens PLM (Siemens) and PTC Inc. (PTC), for the integration of our additive manufacturing technology into Siemens NX software and PTCs Creo software. This enables the streamlining of the design to manufacturing process for products being produced using additive manufacturing. We offer software that enables our customers to more efficiently organize the entire workflow of a 3D printing operation with multiple 3D printing machines, many operators and complex data flow and logistical requirements. We believe that the capabilities of our software products and their unique compatibility with almost all 3D printing systems continue to lead and set standards in the professional 3D printing software market. Customers operating machines from multiple OEMs and customers running large 3D printing operations are among those who can benefit the most from our software packages and we believe that in many cases those customers demand compatibility with our software from the systems of OEMs.\n\nAs of March 31, 2018, our Materialise Software segment (including core competencies) had a team of approximately 269 FTEs and fully dedicated consultants, with approximately 38% based at our headquarters in Belgium and the remaining employees distributed throughout our local field offices in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nBusiness Model. We generate revenue in our Materialise Software segment from our software licenses, maintenance contracts, hardware controller sales for our Materialise Controllers and custom software development services. We license our software products to our customers on either a time-based, most often annual, or perpetual basis, in which case we offer annual maintenance contracts that provide for software updates and support. We charge our custom software development services either on a time and material or on a fixed-cost basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our\n\nS-2\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our ten largest customers in our Materialise Software segment represented 23.0%, 15.6% and 10.5%, respectively, of our Materialise Software segments revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our ten largest customers in our Materialise Software segment represented 26.5% of our Materialise Software segments revenue.\n\nOur Materialise Medical Segment\n\nIn our Materialise Medical segment, our product and services offering addresses what we believe to be long-term trends in the medical industry towards personalized, functional and evidence-based medicine.\n\nAs of March 31, 2018, our Materialise Medical segment consisted of approximately 559 FTEs, with approximately 29% based at our headquarters in Belgium and the remaining employees distributed throughout our local offices in Australia, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nBusiness Model. We generate revenue in our Materialise Medical segment through clinical services and medical software. We sell licenses to our medical software packages and software maintenance contracts and sell medical devices that we print for our customers. We also provide custom software development and engineering services, for which we charge either on a time and material or on a fixed cost basis. The majority of these medical devices that we printed in 2017 were surgical guides (and related bone models) that were distributed to surgeons through our collaboration partners Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer Biomet), Encore Medical, L.P. (d/b/a DJO Surgical) (DJO Surgical), DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson (DePuy Synthes), Howmedica Osteonics Corp. (Stryker), Global Orthopaedic Technology Pty Ltd (Global Orthopaedic Technology), Corin Ltd (Corin), Mathys AG (Mathys) and Limacorporate Spa (Lima). We also print patient-specific implants that we sell directly to hospitals or distribute through partners such as DePuy Synthes. The customer base for our medical software products includes academic institutions, medical device companies and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Materialise Medical segment generated revenue of 42.8 million, 37.9 million and 34.9 million, respectively, representing 30.0%, 33.1% and 34.2% of our total revenue, respectively, and 13.0%, 8.8% and 16.1% growth over the prior year, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our Materialise Medical segment generated revenue of 11.9 million.\n\nMedical Software. Our software allows medical-image based analysis and engineering as well as patient-specific design of surgical devices and implants. Our customers include leading research institutes, renowned hospitals and major medical device companies. Our medical software often serves as an introduction to our capabilities and in certain cases leads to clinical services opportunities. Our medical software packages are:\n\nS-5\n\nsurgical and customized anatomical models to optimize surgical planning. In the framework of our collaborations with certain leading medical device companies, our SurgiCase Connect tool is rebranded and adapted to the specific product offering and needs of our collaboration partners.\n\nOur 3D printed surgical guides include joint replacement guides for knee, shoulder and hip replacement surgeries, osteotomy guides and CMF guides, and our 3D printed implants include hip-revision implants, shoulder and CMF implants. The surgical guides we print for U.S. based patients are FDA-cleared, and our medical devices for EEA-based patients bear the appropriate CE labels. We address large surgical markets in orthopedics and CMF through collaboration agreements with leading medical device companies, including Zimmer-Biomet, DJO Surgical, DePuy Synthes, and Lima. Pursuant to these agreements, we print joint replacement and CMF guides that our collaboration partners distribute under their own brands, together with their own implants, in the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. We leverage our collaboration partners distribution capabilities to extend our reach into these large markets, and our collaboration partners utilize our 3D printing-related expertise to provide surgical planning and customized devices to surgeons. We also address certain high value-added, specialty applications by providing the full solution ourselves, including the delivery of CE-labeled implants and guides directly to the hospital or surgeon. Such applications include customized hip revision, shoulder and CMF implants in a patented porous matrix configuration and osteotomy guides. Our CMF implants, hip revision and shoulder implants and osteotomy guides are currently distributed in Europe, and our CMF implant activities are conducted through our subsidiary OBL SA. The shoulder and hip revision implant activities, which used to be conducted through our subsidiary Mobelife NV, are now conducted through our company, following the dissolution of Mobelife NV.\n\nWe also work with customers to print anatomical models that may be used for a wide range of applications such as sizing of medical devices, clinical trials, training, patient communications and marketing. For example, our HeartPrint service provides 3D printed cardiovascular anatomical models. These models are printed using our proprietary process that makes possible a superior final product that is flexible. We also print transparent or multi-color models for better visualization of the anatomy. Each of our core competencies was instrumental in developing the HeartPrint technology.\n\nSales and Marketing. We distribute our medical software through our direct sales force, our website and PACS partners (some of which partners also include our OrthoView solutions in their product offering to hospitals). We distribute our 3D printed medical devices primarily through our agreements with our collaboration partners such as Zimmer Biomet, Depuy Synthes and Stryker. In specialty markets, we market and distribute our 3D printed medical devices and other clinical services through our experienced engineers who develop a close collaboration with key opinion leaders in each of these market segments.\n\nAll our activities in our Materialise Medical segment are coordinated and supervised from our headquarters in Belgium, which supervises product management and sales of our medical devices and software products.\n\nCustomers. The customers for our Materialise Medical segment mainly include medical device companies, hospitals, universities and industrial companies. For the year ended December 31, 2017, partner sales to medical companies collectively represented 48.5% and total software sales represented 36.5% of our total Materialise Medical segment sales. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, partner sales to medical companies collectively represented 55.9% and total software sales represented 35.1% of our total Materialise Medical segment sales. Most of our other clinical service sales to customers are executed on the basis of single transaction contracts or purchase orders. These contracts and purchase orders lay out the pricing, delivery and other terms of the order.\n\nS-7\n\nCollaboration Partners. We collaborate with leading medical device companies for the development and distribution of our surgical planning software, services, and products, including with Zimmer Biomet, DJO Surgical, DePuy Synthes, Global Orthopaedic Technology, Lima and Mathys. Pursuant to these arrangements, we develop and license software and sell surgical guides, including for use in the fields of knee and shoulder replacement, CMF and thoracic procedures that our collaboration partners may then distribute under their own brands, together with their own implants, mainly in the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In addition, we grant licenses to collaboration partners to use, market and distribute such software or surgical guides. Some of the licenses we have granted to our products and software provide for exclusive rights, including with respect to a particular field of medicine or to the software or product developed during the collaboration, and certain collaboration partners may have rights of first refusal with respect to related products or collaborations. The compensation structures under these arrangements vary and may include an upfront fee, royalties, milestone payments linked to certain targets, and fees for the service, maintenance and training we provide in connection with our software and products.\n\nOur Materialise Manufacturing Segment\n\nIn our Materialise Manufacturing segment, we primarily offer 3D printing services to industrial and commercial customers, the majority of which are located in Europe. In addition, we have identified, and provide 3D printing services to, certain specialty growth markets in both the industrial and consumer marketplaces.\n\nMany of the parts we print require functionality that cannot be delivered using other production processes. We believe that our industrial customers value the high quality, accuracy, complexity, durability, functionality and diversity in terms of size, scale and materials of the 3D printing services that we can offer. We deliver products to highly regulated industries, such as aerospace, healthcare, machine manufacturing, quality control equipment and consumer goods, where our applications, technology and hardware capabilities enable us to adhere to high quality standards in a certified production environment.\n\nAs of March 31, 2018, our Materialise Manufacturing segment consisted of 793 FTEs and fully dedicated consultants, with 28% based at our headquarters in Belgium and the remaining employees distributed throughout our local field offices in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn October 2017, we acquired ACTech Holding Gmbh, ACTech Gmbh and ACTech North America Inc. (ACTech), a full-service manufacturer of complex metal pre-production prototypes. This acquisition increased the scope of our Materialise Manufacturing segments operations and had a significant impact on our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2017, the year ended December 31, 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. As a result of the acquisition of ACTech, we now have in-house post processing capabilities for metal parts. Furthermore, the acquisition of ACTech will enable us to develop and improve our software suite for metal 3D printing through close collaboration with ACTech, taking advantage of learning from an active metal manufacturing environment.\n\nBusiness Model. We generate revenue in our Materialise Manufacturing segment through the sale of parts that we print for our customers and design and engineering. We charge our design and engineering services either on a time or on a fixed-cost basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Materialise Manufacturing segment generated revenue of 63.7 million, 46.4 million and 41.4 million, respectively, representing 44.7%, 40.5% and 40.6% of our total revenue, respectively, and 37.3%, 12.1% and 24.6% growth over the prior year, respectively. Of the revenue generated by our\n\nS-8\n\nparty designs on our i.materialise website. .MGX by Materialise is a collection of 3D printed lamps, furniture, and other home furnishings and accessories, many of which have been developed in collaboration with well-known designers to showcase the opportunities that additive manufacturing offers to create products with a new look and innovative functionality. Pieces from the .MGX collection have become design icons featured in world renowned museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and have won many awards, including the Visionaries! award by the Museum of Art & Design and the Red Dot Design Award. Through the .MGX by Materialise collection, we gain access to professionals as well as home designers. In 2016, we fully integrated the i.materialise platform into our Materialise Manufacturing segment.\n\nSales and Marketing. We market our services to our additive manufacturing solutions business customers using our sales force and through our website. Our more complex product offerings are addressed directly by our specialized sales managers who are located throughout Europe in close proximity to our larger accounts and who align our customers needs with the wide range of 3D printing technologies that we offer. More straightforward products can be ordered directly by our customers through our Materialise OnSite web portal, a proprietary automated system that takes orders, provides quotes and manages the printing process from start to finish, and allows customers to track the manufacturing and shipment process of their product online. Within our larger sales teams, specialized sales managers focus either on rapid prototyping, which is our traditional and well-established market, or the additive manufacturing of end-use production parts, which is the market where we see opportunities for significant growth. Our marketing team in Belgium oversees our global marketing strategy. In addition, employees at our Belgian headquarters and in our local field offices manage sales for particular markets and accounts and provide back office and production management support to our customers.\n\nAll sales for our online sales platform are through our website, and managed mainly from our headquarters in Belgium. We have a separate team dedicated to the fixtures market where our account managers thorough technical knowledge is key to effectively managing our RapidFit+ application.\n\nIn addition, as a result of its specific product portfolio, we have dedicated sales, marketing and project teams based in Germany (Freiberg), the United States and India for ACTech products.\n\nCustomers. The customers for our Materialise Manufacturing segment are from a wide variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, healthcare, industrial machining, art and design and consumer products For these customers, we offer a complete set of services ranging from co-creation, to design and engineering, rapid prototyping, and certified manufacturing of end-use parts, including the RapidFit+ service offered to automotive customers.\n\nThrough our co-creation offering, we work together with customers to solve complex design challenges and to discuss how the introduction of 3D printing can affect product development, manufacturing workflow, business models and customer experiences. For example, a co-creation with HOYA Vision Core Company (HOYA), in collaboration with Hoet Design Studio, saw the launch of the worlds first vision-centric, 3D-tailored eyewear solution, Yuniku, in the fall of 2016. Yuniku enables individualized lens and frame design through a sophisticated end-to-end digital supply chain, which includes a custom 3D scanner and software platform, co-created by us and HOYA, directly linked to our manufacturing factory where we provide our Certified Additive Manufacturing services. In 2017, we started shipping the first Yuniku scanners.\n\nThrough our design and engineering service, we also provide support for those customers looking for support in their initial concept design or with maximizing a design for 3D printing. Our design and\n\nS-10\n\nengineering team, which is comprised of highly specialized designers and CAD engineers, offers dedicated design and software support for additive manufacturing, including remodeling and file preparation, as well as 3D scanning and measuring.\n\nThe customers of both our Materialise OnSite and i.materialise platforms order through our website. Materialise OnSite customers tend to be industrial customers looking to rapid prototype parts quickly and reliably, often taking advantage of fast-lane machines to ensure short lead times for time-critical projects. For i.materialise, while there is a potential to address the wide consumer market with this platform, we prefer to describe our current customers as home professionals. Our i.materialise client base includes independent designers and CAD hobbyists that often sell their creations or their services to others, including, in certain instances, through the i.materialise gallery. Through i.materialises APIs, companies can also partner with i.materialise to give their own customers a cloud-based, 3D-printing solution on their website, streamlining the ordering, manufacturing and shipping processes through a direct link to our factory for 3D printing. Since 2016, Microsoft has been using the i.materialise API to offer a cloud-based 3D print solution for Windows 10 users, and PTC did the same for Creo 4.0 software users.\n\nMost of our straightforward additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping solutions are executed on the basis of single transaction contracts or purchase orders with the customer. These contracts and purchase orders lay out the pricing, delivery and other terms of the order. For our Certified Additive Manufacturing service an entirely new approach to ensure parts are made according to agreed standards is required, for which we have set processes to onboard new customers. An example of this is our dedicated aerospace manufacturing line, backed by certifications EN9100 and EASA Part 21G, through which we are currently manufacturing plastic parts for Airbuss A350 XWB. We expect that as demand for our Certified Additive Manufacturing service grows, more long-term agreements may be entered into.\n\nFor the automotive manufacturers and their suppliers that use our RapidFit+ service, the fixtures are custom engineered by dedicated teams. Our RapidFit+ customers, which include their quality departments, expect that fixtures meet high accuracy standards. A number of automotive OEMs in Europe are currently considering our innovative solution as a potential new standard, while a solid base of automotive Tier 1 suppliers in Europe has embraced RapidFit as one of their fixture solutions. We see that a growing number of global Tier 1 suppliers with facilities in the United States are currently placing limited orders with a view to investigating the advantages of our RapidFit+ technology.\n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nMaterialise Software Segment\n\nWe sell our software together with the initial sale of 3D printing systems as well as into the installed base of existing 3D printing systems. We expect the number of internal and external service or production centers across the 3D printing industry to grow with 3D printing operations running more complex mixes of machines from different manufacturers and based on various technologies. As 3D printing will be increasingly used for the manufacturing of complex or customized end parts, and as the number of 3D printer manufacturers increases with certain new players initially focusing more on the hardware than on the software component of their 3D printers, we believe the demand for highly performing industrial 3D printing software platforms is likely to grow accordingly. Furthermore, we believe that the worldwide market for additive manufacturing software is tied to the growth of the overall additive manufacturing sector and, in particular, the number of industrial 3D printing systems in operation. We expect that the volume of industrial 3D printing systems sold will grow with increased adoption of additive manufacturing processes, and that 3D printing software, in particular in the professional segment of the market, will increasingly be needed to interface with these systems and allow for more efficient operation of those systems.\n\nS-11\n\nWe believe that we can continue to expand our market penetration through expanding relationships with customers and OEMs, and through the continued innovation of our software products to adapt to and meet market demands. In order to be able to do so, we intend to bring our teams closer to our customer base worldwide, which will require continued investments in the expansion of our marketing and sales presence. In order to be able to meet the demands of new entrants on the market, we also intend to continue to invest significantly in the development of our software products, including furthering their compatibility with as many 3D printers on the market utilizing as many different material types as possible. For example, we believe the market for metal-based printing will be a key growth area in the additive manufacturing industry and, while we believe we currently have a strong market position in software for metal printing, we are also committed to research and development of metal-based technologies, such as machine integration and porous structures generation.\n\nMaterialise Medical Segment\n\nThe Materialise Medical segment is the market where we believe we can most directly realize our mission statement and contribute to a healthier world while providing multiple opportunities for continued revenue growth. We are committed to expanding the reach of our medical software as well as currently investing significantly in the development of new product offerings as well as the expansion of our distribution channel in the various sub-segments of our Materialise Medical segment. In the surgical guide business, our growth over the last few years has come primarily from the knee-implant market, a market where medical device companies are currently developing their own guide solutions. Within the surgical guide market we continue to focus on and see opportunities to further penetrate markets currently served as well as expand into new markets. Over the past few years, we have been developing solutions for additional joints and have launched guides for shoulders and hips. We have also developed other applications, such as malunion and osteotomy surgical guides. We intend to further diversify our product portfolio through product development as well as entering into new collaborations. For example, we are making significant investments in research to produce 3D printable models based on X-ray data.\n\nIn the implant business, the extensive clinical evidence that both OBL SA and Mobelife NV have developed with key opinion leaders over the last few years regarding the efficacy of our customized CMF and hip revision implant solutions is now gradually finding its way into scientific publications. We believe that this development will help the growth of our CMF and hip revision implant activities, which we intend to further support through distributors as well as our local sales offices. In addition, we expect to leverage our experience with existing implant activities to develop new applications for other rare conditions that may benefit significantly from a patient-specific solution. We expect that both our existing CMF and hip revision implant activities and the development of applications for new specialty markets will require additional significant investments in the near future. However, we expect such investments to form the basis of stable annual revenue growth in the longer term.\n\nAs a result of the trend that we see in the medical community towards more patient-specific devices and treatments, a growing number of academic, clinical and commercial researchers are focusing on customized medical treatments. Because these new products and treatments can only be brought to the market in compliance with very strict regulatory requirements, we believe there is an opportunity for providers of safe and stable medical software tools, such as our company, that can pass and have previously passed significant regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWe believe that our medical services and software may also help to reduce the clinical trial effort and expense for medical device companies by allowing more efficient bench-top modelling, testing and simulations, and by increasing efficiency in the selection of eligible patients.\n\nS-12\n\nIn general, our customers use our Mimics Innovation Suite either as a research and development tool for the development of new medical devices or innovative surgical approaches or as a production tool for the manufacturing of customized or customizable medical devices. The needs and priorities of our Mimics Innovation Suite customers vary depending on their primary use. Customers that focus on research and development applications prefer an advanced, rapidly evolving tool that gives them immediate access to our latest innovations. In contrast, customers that focus on production require a more static product that has passed extensive testing and verification required for regulatory purposes. We have launched two versions of our Mimics Innovations Suite, through which we aim to better tailor the product to this differentiated customer base.\n\nAs we intend to continue to invest in product development and market penetration, we will require certain capital commitments and may experience a near-term impact to our revenue and profitability levels. However, we expect such investments to form the basis of stable annual revenue growth in the longer term.\n\nOur medical engineering services offerings, which we continue to build, assist medical device companies in their designs. Our engineers not only serve the orthopedic field but also the cardiovascular field where new and customized approaches are being developed and the sizing of devices is an important development area. As product managers in the medical device industry continue to recognize the value of, and need for, specialized advice and assistance in the design of new 3D printable devices, our medical engineering services may grow accordingly.\n\nMaterialise Manufacturing Segment\n\nWe believe that we can continue to meet and benefit from the growing industrial demand for 3D printing services, in particular by increasing the number and capacity of our 3D printing service centers in Europe.\n\nWe believe that there is particular potential to grow our presence in the markets for additive manufacturing of end products, including for example fixtures for the automotive industry and eyewear products. In recent years, more companies have been using additive manufacturing for production across a broad range of industrial sectors, including aerospace, orthopedic implants, surgical guides, dental copings and hearing devices. Additive manufacturing is also being used to manufacture specialty furniture, accessories for the home and office, personal accessories, fashion products, jewelry and footwear.\n\nFor industrial end parts, we intend to continue to invest in the expansion and creation of certified 3D manufacturing environments that meet the high standards of the specialized segments of the industrial production market that we focus on. In addition, we believe that our local sales teams, which are in close proximity to our customers, as well as our engineering teams, which can bring in additional expertise where required, are important and rather unique assets in this market that are worthwhile to continue to invest in.\n\nWe believe that we will be able to better position our metal 3D printing offering, in particular in the production of unique or small batches of complex metal parts (including pre-production prototypes) for the automotive industry. Our October 4, 2017 acquisition of ACTech, a full-service manufacturer of complex metal pre-production prototypes, has increased the scope of our Materialise Manufacturing segments operations and should allow us to further expand our presence into new vertical end markets and our exposure to production versus prototype parts. We expect to continue to focus on developing the capabilities necessary to provide 3D printing services that can benefit from new material types that gain traction in the additive manufacturing market in the future.\n\nS-13\n\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\n\nAs a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company:\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2019, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (iii) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), which would occur if the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\n\nWe may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from our competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you have made an investment.\n\nCompany Information\n\nOur principal executive and registered offices are located at Technologielaan 15, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.

The rates have been fixed at 2.403% and 2.719%, respectively, with principal repayment dates between 2021 and 2026 for the first tranche, and between 2022 and 2027 for the second tranche. The interest rates include an initial margin of 1.86% determined in accordance with the terms of the EIB Facility Agreement, and may still vary based on certain EBITDA levels and debt ratios. The terms of the EIB Facility Agreement provide that the drawing of the second tranche is subject to a specified debt ratio being met.\n\nFor additional details regarding the terms of the EIB Facility Agreement, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesMaterial Unused Sources of Liquidity in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\nStrategic Alliance Partnership Agreement\n\nOn July 18, 2018, we and BASF New Business GmbH (BASF New Business), a subsidiary of BASF SE, the German chemical conglomerate (FWB: BAS), entered into a Strategic Alliance Partnership Agreement (the Strategic Alliance Partnership Agreement). The Strategic Alliance Partnership Agreement establishes a framework for collaboration to leverage the parties existing strengths and expertise to develop new materials for the 3D printing industry. In particular, the agreement contemplates that we and BASF New Business will collaborate in multiple areas including: (i) materials supply and development, (ii) application development, (iii) research & development in new technology fields, (iv) interchange of expertise and know-how in additive manufacturing production in the fields of 3D printing processes, and (v) pursuit of new business development opportunities in the field of additive manufacturing in various industries.\n\nThe Strategic Alliance Partnership Agreement specifies the general terms under which we and BASF New Business will negotiate further final and binding agreements for the multiple areas of cooperation contemplated by the agreement, and provides an indicative timeline for concluding such negotiations by November 2018. Although we and BASF New Business have already commenced some development activities, and we have agreed to provide BASF New Business preferential access to our facilities as well as to our Materialise OnSite web portal, the financial and other specific terms of our proposed partnerships, which we expect to be mutually beneficial to both parties, have not yet been finalized.\n\nSubscription Agreement\n\nIn connection with the entry into the Strategic Alliance Partnership Agreement, we and BASF Antwerpen NV (BASF Antwerpen), a subsidiary of BASF SE, entered into a Subscription Agreement (the Subscription Agreement) pursuant to which BASF Antwerpen subscribed for 1,953,125 of our newly issued ordinary shares, for an aggregate subscription price of approximately $25 million (the Private Placement). The ordinary shares subscribed for were delivered to BASF Antwerpen on July 19, 2018. We expect to use the net proceeds of the Private Placement for general corporate purposes (including, but not limited to, potential acquisitions or partnerships). The Subscription Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, BASF Antwerpen has agreed not to sell or transfer the ordinary shares until six months after the closing date of the Private Placement. Upon the expiration of these transfer restrictions, if BASF Antwerpen believes in good faith that it is not able to resell all the ordinary shares publicly pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, we have agreed, upon BASF Antwerpens request and subject to certain conditions, to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the ordinary shares (in the form of ADSs) for resale within 45 days of\n\nS-15\n\nsuch request, which registration statement will be required to become effective within 120 days following such request.\n\nEstimated June 30, 2018 Quarterly Financial Results\n\nOur estimated financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2018 presented below are preliminary and are subject to the completion of our quarter-end closing procedures and managements financial review. The preliminary financial data have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, our management. BDO Bedrijfsrevisoren Burg. CVBA, our independent registered public accounting firm, has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to this preliminary financial data. Accordingly, BDO Bedrijfsrevisoren Burg. CVBA does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. These estimates are not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for this period and should not be viewed as a substitute for full interim financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS). Our actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of the completion of our quarter-end closing procedures, review adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for this period are finalized.\n\nWhile complete financial information as of and for such period is not available, based on the information and data currently available, we preliminarily estimate that for the three months ended June 30, 2018, we will have revenue between 44.9 million and 45.1 million and an operating profit between 0.5 million and 0.8 million, compared with revenue and operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of 33.6 million and 0.3 million, respectively.\n\nThese estimates are preliminary and may change. In addition, these preliminary results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2018 or in any other future period. There can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized, and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control. See the sections entitled Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\n\nS-16\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvestment in the ADSs offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus involves risks. In addition to the information presented in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other documents we file with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should consider carefully the following risk factors before deciding to purchase these ADSs.\n\nRisks Related to the ADSs and this Offering\n\nAs a new investor, you will experience substantial dilution as a result of this offering.\n\nThe public offering price per ADS will be substantially higher than the net tangible book value per ADS prior to this offering. Consequently, if you purchase ADSs in this offering at the public offering price of $13.000 per ADS, you will incur immediate dilution of $11.17 per ADS from an accounting perspective on a consolidated basis. For further information regarding the dilution resulting from this offering, please see the section entitled Dilution in this prospectus supplement. This dilution is due in large part to the fact that our earlier investors paid substantially less than the public offering price when they purchased their ordinary shares. In addition, if the underwriters exercise the overallotment option, you will experience additional dilution.\n\nThe ADSs may experience price and volume fluctuations.\n\nThe stock market generally has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price and liquidity of the market for the ADSs that will prevail in the market after this offering may be higher or lower than the price you pay and may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\n\n\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors.\n\nAny of these factors could result in a material decline in the price of the ADSs.\n\nS-19\n\nMembers of our board of directors and senior management own a significant percentage of our ordinary shares and are able to exert significant influence over matters subject to shareholder approval.\n\nMembers of our board of directors and senior management (including members of the executive committee) beneficially owned approximately 72.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs), as of March 31, 2018. These shareholders have significant influence over the election of members of our board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including dividend policy, mergers, share capital increases, amendments of our articles of association and other extraordinary transactions. For example, these shareholders may be able to influence the outcome of elections of members of our board of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transactions. In addition, our articles of association provide that, as long as Wilfried Vancraen, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Hilde Ingelaere, an Executive Vice President of our company who is also Mr. Vancraens spouse, and their three children, Linde, Sander and Jeroen Vancraen, or collectively the Family Shareholders, control, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate at least 20% of the voting rights attached to our ordinary shares, a majority of our directors must be appointed by our shareholders from a list of candidates proposed by the Family Shareholders. See Description of Share Capital in the accompanying prospectus. This concentration of ownership within this group of shareholders and the rights of the Family Shareholders prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our ordinary shares or ADSs that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our shareholders. The interests of these existing shareholders or the Family Shareholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other shareholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders, including seeking a premium value for their ordinary shares, which might affect the prevailing market price for the ADSs.\n\nSubstantial future sales of our ordinary shares or ADSs in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of the ADSs to decline.\n\nAdditional sales of our ordinary shares or ADSs in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of the ADSs to decline. A substantial number of outstanding ordinary shares are, and the ADSs sold in this offering upon issuance will be, freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.\n\nUpon completion of the Private Placement and this offering, we will have 52,381,419 ordinary shares outstanding (including 16,490,070 ordinary shares represented by ADSs). Upon the completion of the Private Placement and this offering, approximately 34,344,690 ordinary shares (including 125,034 ordinary shares represented by ADSs) held by the members of our board of directors, our senior management, key employees and certain shareholders will be subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the sale of ordinary shares and ADSs by those parties for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement. However, all of the ADSs sold in this offering and the remaining ordinary shares outstanding prior to this offering (including 16,365,036 ordinary shares represented by ADSs, but excluding the ordinary shares to be issued in the Private Placement) will not be subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters and, except to the extent such shares are held by our affiliates and are not registered for public resale under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. In the case of the 1,953,125 ordinary shares to be issued in the Private Placement, although these shares will not be subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters, these shares will be restricted securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and subject to transfer restrictions under the Subscription Agreement, including a six-month lock-up agreement. See Prospectus SummaryRecent DevelopmentsSubscription Agreement. In addition, following the expiration of the 90-day lock up period referenced above, the holders holding approximately 35,032,250 ordinary shares have registration rights pursuant to which we have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form F-3 registering the public resale of such shares (represented by ADSs). The\n\nS-20\n\nmarket price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales by our shareholders in the market following completion of this offering or the perception that these sales could occur.\n\nThe dilutive effect of our warrants and convertible bonds could have an adverse effect on the future market price of the ADSs or otherwise adversely affect the interests of our shareholders.\n\nBased on outstanding granted warrants and outstanding convertible bonds, as of March 31, 2018, there were outstanding granted warrants to subscribe for an aggregate of 1,302,143 ordinary shares at a weighted average exercise price of 8.04 per share, and 1.0 million of outstanding convertible bonds convertible into an aggregate of 508,904 ordinary shares at a conversion price of 1.97 per share. The warrants and convertible bonds likely will be exercised or converted if the market price of the ADSs equals or exceeds the applicable exercise or conversion price. To the extent such securities are exercised or converted, additional ordinary shares will be issued, which would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\n\nWe have broad discretion to determine how to use the funds raised in this offering and may use them in ways that may not enhance our results of operations or the price of the ADSs.\n\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering, and we could spend the proceeds from this offering in ways the holders of the ADSs may not agree with or that do not yield a favorable return, if any. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes (including, but not limited to, potential acquisitions or partnerships). However, our use of these proceeds may differ substantially from our current plans. You will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether proceeds are being used appropriately. You must rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. If we do not invest or apply the proceeds of this offering in ways that improve our results of operations, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause the price of the ADSs to decline.\n\nWe do not expect to be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes; however, there is a risk that we may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\n\nWe do not expect to be a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC). However, the relevant rules are not entirely clear and certain aspects of the tests will be outside our control; therefore, no assurance can be given that we will not be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year. If you are a U.S. taxpayer and we are determined to be a PFIC at any time during your holding period, you may be subject to materially adverse consequences, including additional tax liability and tax filing obligations. See TaxationU.S. TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company.\n\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information we collect.\n\nIn addition to the risks set out under this heading in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017, we are still working on achieving compliance with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which came into force on May 25, 2018. We have completed a gap assessment in March 2018 in which we identified the areas where we need to adapt our business to become fully compliant with the GDPR. We are now working on implementing the findings and recommendations from the gap assessment.\n\nS-21\n\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis prospectus supplement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, concerning our business, operations and financial performance and condition as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition. Any statements that are not of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, plans, intends, may, could, might, will, should, aims, or other similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places throughout this prospectus supplement and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, assumptions, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things, our intellectual property position, research and development projects, acquisitions, results of operations, cash needs, spending of the proceeds from the Private Placement and this offering as well as the remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth and strategies, regulatory approvals and clearances, the markets and industry in which we operate and the trends and competition that may affect the markets, industry or us.\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics and industry change, and depend on economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this prospectus supplement, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in some cases beyond our control. All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nActual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, risks related to:\n\n\n\nour relationships with suppliers;\n\nS-22\n\n\n\nour international operations;\n\nIn addition, under Prospectus Supplement SummaryRecent DevelopmentsEstimated June 30, 2018 Quarterly Financial Results, we have included certain preliminary estimates of our financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2018.\n\nAny forward-looking statements that we make in this prospectus supplement speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this prospectus supplement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after the date of this prospectus supplement. See Where You Can Find More Information.\n\nYou should also read carefully the factors described in the Risk Factors sections of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and under Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017 to better understand the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the documents that we incorporate herein and therein by reference, will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified timeframe, or at all.\n\nS-23\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares, and we have no present intention of declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any recommendation by our board of directors to pay dividends, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, including under agreements for indebtedness that we may incur, will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, legal requirements, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\n\nAll of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs offered by this prospectus supplement will have the same dividend rights as all of our other outstanding shares. In general, distributions of dividends proposed by our board of directors require the approval of our shareholders at a shareholders meeting, although our board of directors may declare interim dividends without shareholder approval. See Description of Share Capital in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Belgian law, the calculation of amounts available for distribution to shareholders, as dividends or otherwise, must be determined on the basis of our non-consolidated statutory financial statements prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in Belgium (Belgian GAAP). In addition, in accordance with Belgian law and our articles of association, we must allocate each year an amount of at least 5% of our annual net profit under our statutory non-consolidated accounts (prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP) to a legal reserve until the reserve equals 10% of our share capital. Our legal reserve currently meets this requirement. As a consequence of these facts there can be no assurance as to whether dividends or other distributions will be paid out in the future or, if they are paid, their amount.\n\nFor information regarding the Belgian withholding tax applicable to dividends and related U.S. reimbursement procedures, see TaxationBelgian Taxation.\n\nS-25\n\nDILUTION\n\nIf you invest in the ADSs in this offering, your interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per ADS and the pro forma net tangible book value per ADS after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the public offering price per ADS is substantially in excess of the net tangible book value per ADS attributable to our existing shareholders for our ordinary shares that will be outstanding immediately prior to the closing of this offering. We calculate net tangible book value per ordinary share by dividing the net tangible book value (total assets less goodwill, intangible assets and total liabilities) by the number of outstanding ordinary shares. For purposes of illustration, the following discussion assumes that all of our outstanding shares both before and after this offering are in the form of ADSs, each representing one ordinary share. Dilution is determined by subtracting net tangible book value per ADS from the public offering price per ADS.\n\nOur net tangible book value as of March 31, 2018 was $35.2 million, or $0.74 per ADS. Investors participating in this offering will incur immediate and substantial dilution. After giving effect to (i) the Private Placement and (ii) the sale by us of the ADSs in this offering at the public offering price of $13.000 per ADS, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma net tangible book value as of March 31, 2018 would have been approximately $95.7 million, or $1.83 per ADS. This amount represents an immediate increase in our pro forma net tangible book value of $1.08 per ADS to our existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $11.17 per ADS to new investors purchasing the ADSs in this offering at the public offering price.\n\nThe following table illustrates this dilution per ADS:\n\nIf the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per ADS would be $1.91 per ADS, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $1.17 per share to existing shareholders and immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $11.09 per share to investors purchasing ordinary shares in this offering.\n\nThe table set forth above excludes the following shares:\n\nS-29\n\nTAXATION\n\nBelgian Taxation\n\nThe following paragraphs are a summary of material Belgian tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs by an investor. The summary is based on laws, treaties and regulatory interpretations in effect in Belgium on the date of this document, all of which are subject to change, including changes that could have retroactive effect.\n\nThe summary only discusses Belgian tax aspects which are relevant to U.S. holders of ADSs (Holders). This summary does not address Belgian tax aspects which are relevant to persons who are residents in Belgium or engaged in a trade or business in Belgium through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in Belgium. This summary does not purport to be a description of all of the tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs, and does not take into account the specific circumstances of any particular investor, some of which may be subject to special rules, or the tax laws of any country other than Belgium. This summary does not describe the tax treatment of investors that are subject to special rules, such as banks, insurance companies, collective investment undertakings, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold, or will hold, ADSs in a position in a straddle, share-repurchase transaction, conversion transactions, synthetic security or other integrated financial transactions. Investors should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in ADSs in the light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any state, local or other national laws.\n\nIn addition to the assumptions mentioned above, it is also assumed in this discussion that for purposes of the domestic Belgian tax legislation, the owners of ADSs will be treated as the owners of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. However, the assumption has not been confirmed or verified with the Belgian Tax Administration.\n\nDividend Withholding Tax\n\nAs a general rule, a withholding tax of 30% is levied on the gross amount of dividends paid on the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs, subject to such relief as may be available under applicable domestic or tax treaty provisions. Dividends subject to the dividend withholding tax include all benefits attributed to the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs, irrespective of their form. A reimbursement of fiscal capital made in accordance with the Belgian Company Code is partly considered to be a distribution of the existing taxed reserves (irrespective whether incorporated into the capital or not) and/or the tax-free reserves incorporated into the capital. The proportion is determined on the basis of the ratio between certain taxed reserves and tax-free reserves incorporated into the capital on the one hand and, on the other hand, the aggregate of such reserves and the fiscal capital. In principle, fiscal capital includes paid-up statutory share capital, and subject to certain conditions, the paid-up issue premiums and the cash amounts subscribed to at the time of the issue of profit sharing certificates.\n\nIn case of a redemption by us of own shares represented by ADSs, the redemption distribution (after deduction of the portion of fiscal capital represented by the redeemed shares) will be treated as a dividend which in certain circumstances may be subject to a withholding tax of 30%, subject to such relief as may be available under applicable domestic or tax treaty provisions. In case of a liquidation of our Company, any amounts distributed in excess of the fiscal capital will be subject to a 30% withholding tax, subject to such relief as may be available under applicable domestic or tax treaty provisions.\n\nFor non-resident individuals and companies, the dividend withholding tax will be the only tax on dividends in Belgium, unless the non-resident holds ADSs in connection with a business conducted in Belgium, through a fixed base in Belgium or a Belgian permanent establishment.\n\nS-31\n\nRelief of Belgian Dividend Withholding Tax\n\nUnder the Belgium-United States Tax Treaty (the Treaty), there is a reduced Belgian withholding tax rate of 15% on dividends paid by us to a U.S. resident which beneficially owns the dividends and is entitled to claim the benefits of the Treaty under the limitation of benefits article included in the Treaty, (a Qualifying Holder). If such Qualifying Holder is a company that owns directly at least 10% of our voting stock, the Belgian withholding tax rate is further reduced to 5%. No withholding tax is however applicable if the Qualifying Holder, is: (i) a company that is a resident of the United States that has owned directly ADSs representing at least 10% of our capital for a 12-month period ending on the date the dividend is declared, or (ii) a pension fund that is a resident of the United States, provided that such dividends are not derived from the carrying on of a business by the pension fund or through an associated enterprise.\n\nUnder the normal procedure, we or our paying agent must withhold the full Belgian withholding tax (without taking into account the Treaty rate). Qualifying Holders may make a claim for reimbursement for amounts withheld in excess of the rate defined by the Treaty. The reimbursement form (Form 276 Div-Aut.) may be obtained from the Bureau Central de Taxation Bruxelles-Etranger, 33 Boulevard Roi Albert II, 33 (North Galaxy Tower B7), 1030 Brussels, Belgium or online on the website of the Belgian tax authorities. Qualifying Holders may also, subject to certain conditions, obtain the reduced Treaty rate at source. Qualifying Holders should deliver a duly completed Form 276 Div-Aut. no later than ten days after the date on which the dividend is paid. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to whether they qualify for reduction in withholding tax upon payment or attribution of dividends, and as to the procedural requirements for obtaining a reduced withholding tax upon the payment of dividends or for making claims for reimbursement.\n\nWithholding tax is also not applicable, pursuant to Belgian domestic tax law, on dividends paid to certain U.S. pension funds provided that the U.S. pension fund (i) qualifies as a non-resident saver for Belgian withholding tax purposes (i.e., it has a separate legal personality and fiscal residence outside of Belgium), (ii) has a corporate purpose that consists solely in managing and investing funds collected in order to pay legal or complementary pensions, (iii) has activity that is limited to the investment of funds collected in the exercise of its statutory purpose, without any profit making activity and (iv) is exempt from income taxes in the United States. Furthermore, such pension fund may not contractually be obligated to redistribute the dividends to any beneficial owner of such dividends for whom it would manage the ADSs and subject to certain procedural formalities.\n\nUnder Belgian domestic tax law, a withholding tax exemption is available to dividends paid to a non-resident corporate shareholder (located in the European Economic Area or in a country with which Belgium has entered in a double tax treaty including sufficient information exchange provisions) provided that (i) at the date of payment or attribution of the dividend it holds a participation in our company representing at least 10% of our share capital, (ii) this holding has been held in full ownership for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, (iii) this non-resident corporate shareholder is subject to a corporate income tax regime similar to Belgian corporate income tax regime without benefitting from a notably advantageous tax regime as compared to the ordinary income tax regime and (iv) its legal form is (similar to one of the legal forms) listed in the annex of the E.U. directive dated 23 July 1990 (90/435/EC) as amended by the directive of 22 December 2003 (2003/123/EC). This reduced withholding tax will apply provided that certain procedural formalities are complied with.\n\nFinally, a withholding tax exemption is available, pursuant to Belgian domestic tax law, to dividends paid to a non-resident corporate shareholder (located in the European Economic Area or in a country with which Belgium has entered in a double tax treaty including sufficient information exchange provisions) to the extent that at the date of payment or attribution of the dividend it holds a participation in our company representing less than 10% of our share capital but the acquisition value of\n\nS-32\n\nwhich is at least 2.5 million and provided that certain other conditions are met, i.e., that (i) this holding has been held in full ownership for an uninterrupted period of at least one year (ii) this non-resident corporate shareholder is subject to a corporate income tax regime similar to Belgian corporate income tax regime without benefitting from a notably advantageous tax regime as compared to the ordinary income tax regime, and (iii) its legal form is (similar to one of the legal forms) listed in the annex I, part A, of the E.U. directive dated 30 November 2011 (2011/96/EU). This reduced withholding tax will apply only if and to the extent that the ordinary Belgian withholding tax cannot be credited or reimbursed to the non-resident corporate shareholder referred to below and subject to certain procedural formalities.\n\nCapital Gains and Losses\n\nPursuant to the Treaty, capital gains and/or losses realized by a Qualifying Holder from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs do not fall within the scope of application of Belgian domestic tax law.\n\nCapital gains realized on ADSs by a corporate Holder which is not entitled to claim the benefits of the Treaty under the limitation of benefits article included in the Treaty are generally not subject to taxation in Belgium unless the corporate Holder is acting through a Belgian permanent establishment. Capital losses are not deductible.\n\nPrivate individual Holders who are not entitled to claim the benefits of the Treaty under the limitation of benefits article included in the Treaty and which are holding ADSs as a private investment will, as a rule, not be subject to tax on any capital gains arising out of a disposal of ADSs. Losses will, as a rule, not be deductible in Belgium.\n\nHowever, if the gain realized by such individual Holders on ADSs is deemed to be realized outside the scope of the normal management of such individuals private estate and the capital gain is obtained or received in Belgium, the gain will be subject to a final withholding tax of 30.28%. The Official Commentary to the ITC 1992 stipulates that occasional transactions on a stock exchange regarding ADSs should not be considered as transactions realized outside the scope of normal management of ones own private estate.\n\nCapital gains realized by such individual Holders on the disposal of ADSs for consideration, outside the exercise of a professional activity, to a non-resident company (or a body constituted in a similar legal form), to a foreign state (or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities) or to a non-resident legal entity who is established outside the European Economic Area, are in principle taxable at a rate of 16.5% if, at any time during the five years preceding the sale, such individual Holders has owned directly or indirectly, alone or with his/her spouse or with certain relatives, a substantial shareholding in us (that is, a shareholding of more than 25% of our shares).\n\nCapital gains realized by a Holder upon the redemption of ADSs or upon our liquidation will generally be taxable as a dividend. See section Dividend Withholding Tax.\n\nEstate and Gift Tax\n\nThere is no Belgian estate tax on the transfer of ADSs upon the death of a Belgian non-resident.\n\nDonations of ADSs made in Belgium may or may not be subject to gift tax in Belgium depending on the modalities under which the donation is carried out.\n\nBelgian Tax on Stock Exchange Transactions\n\nA tax on stock exchange transactions (taxe sur les opérations de bourse/taks op de beursverrichtingen) is generally levied on the purchase and the sale and on any other acquisition and transfer for consideration\n\nS-33\n\nof existing ADSs on the secondary market carried out by a Belgian resident investor through a professional intermediary if (i) executed in Belgium through a professional intermediary, or (ii) deemed to be executed in Belgium, which is the case if the order is directly or indirectly made to a professional intermediary established outside of Belgium, either by private individuals having their usual residence in Belgium, or legal entities for the account of their seat or establishment in Belgium.\n\nThe applicable rate amounts to 0.35% of the consideration paid but with a cap of 1,600 per transaction and per party. The tax is due separately from each party to any such transaction, i.e., the seller (transferor) and the purchaser (transferee), both collected by the professional intermediary.\n\nHowever, if the intermediary is established outside of Belgium, the tax will in principle be due by the ordering private individual or legal entity, unless that individual or entity can demonstrate that the tax has already been paid. Professional intermediaries established outside of Belgium can, subject to certain conditions and formalities, appoint a Belgian representative for tax purposes, which will liable for the tax on stock exchange transactions in respect of the transactions executed through the professional intermediary.\n\nBelgian non-residents who purchase or otherwise acquire or transfer, for consideration, ADSs in Belgium for their own account through a professional intermediary may be exempt from the stock market tax if they deliver a sworn affidavit to the intermediary in Belgium confirming their non-resident status.\n\nA tax on repurchase transactions (taxe sur les reports/taks op de reportverrichtingen) at the rate of 0.085%. will be due from each party to any such transaction entered into or carried out in Belgium by a Belgian resident investor in which a stockbroker acts for either party (with a maximum amount of 1,600 per transaction and per party).\n\nNo stock exchange tax, nor tax on repurchase transactions is payable by: (i) professional intermediaries described in Article 2, 9° and 10° of the Law of August 2, 2002 acting for their own account, (ii) insurance companies described in Article 2, §1 of the Law of 9 July 1975 acting for their own account, (iii) professional retirement institutions referred to in Article 2, 1° of the Law of October 27, 2006 relating to the control of professional retirement institutions acting for their own account, (iv) collective investment institutions acting for their own account, or (v) regulated real estate companies (for the stock exchange tax only).\n\nNo stock exchange tax, nor tax on repurchase transactions will thus be due by Holders on the subscription, purchase or sale of ADSs, if the Holders are acting for their own account. In order to benefit from this exemption, the Holders must file with the professional intermediary in Belgium a sworn affidavit evidencing that they are non-residents for Belgian tax purposes.\n\nBelgian Tax on Securities Accounts\n\nPursuant to the law of February 7, 2018 introducing a tax on securities accounts, a tax of 0.15% will be levied on Belgian resident and non-resident individuals on their share in the average value of the qualifying financial instruments (including but not limited to shares, certificates thereof, notes and units of undertakings for collective investment) held on one or more securities accounts during a reference period of twelve consecutive months starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the subsequent year (Tax on Securities Accounts). The first reference period starts on the day of entry into effect of the Law (i.e., March 10, 2018) and ends on September 30, 2018.\n\nNo Tax on Securities Accounts will be due provided the holders share in the average value of the qualifying financial instruments on those accounts amounts to less than 500,000. If, however, the holders share in the average value of the qualifying financial instruments on those accounts amounts to\n\nS-34\n\n500,000 or more, the Tax on Securities Accounts will be due on the entire share of the holder in the average value of the qualifying financial instruments on those accounts (and, hence, not only on the part which exceeds the 500,000 threshold).\n\nQualifying financial instruments held by non-resident individuals only fall within the scope of the Tax on Securities Accounts provided they are held on securities accounts with a financial intermediary established or located in Belgium. Note that pursuant to certain double tax treaties, Belgium has no right to tax capital. Hence, to the extent the Tax on Securities Accounts is viewed as a tax on capital within the meaning of these double tax treaties, treaty protection may, subject to certain conditions, be claimed.\n\nA financial intermediary is defined as (i) a credit institution or a stockbroking firm as defined by Article 1, §2 and §3 of the Law of 25 April 2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions and investment companies and (ii) the investment companies as defined by Article 3, §1 of the Law of 25 October 2016 on access to the activity of investment services and on the legal status and supervision of portfolio management and investment advice companies, which are, pursuant to national law, admitted to hold financial instruments for the account of customers.\n\nThe Tax on Securities Accounts is in principle due by the financial intermediary established or located in Belgium if (i) the holders share in the average value of the qualifying financial instruments held on one or more securities accounts with said intermediary amounts to 500,000 or more or (ii) the holder instructed the financial intermediary to levy the Tax on Securities Accounts due (e.g., in case such holder holds qualifying financial instruments on several securities accounts held with multiple intermediaries of which the average value does not amount to 500,000 or more, but of which the holders share in the total average value of these accounts amounts to at least 500,000). Otherwise, the Tax on Securities Accounts would have to be declared and would be due by the holder itself unless the holder provides evidence that the Tax on Securities Accounts has already been withheld, declared and paid by an intermediary which is not established or located in Belgium. In that respect, intermediaries located or established outside of Belgium could appoint a Tax on the Securities Accounts representative in Belgium, subject to certain conditions and formalities (a Tax on the Securities Accounts Representative). Such a Tax on the Securities Accounts Representative will then be liable towards the Belgian Treasury for the Tax on the Securities Accounts due and for complying with certain reporting obligations in that respect.\n\nBelgian resident individuals will have to report in their annual income tax return various securities accounts held with one or more financial intermediaries of which they are considered as a holder within the meaning of the Tax on Securities Accounts. Non-resident individuals have to report in their annual Belgian non-resident income tax return various securities accounts held with one or more financial intermediaries established or located in Belgium of which they are considered as a holder within the meaning of the Tax on Securities Accounts.\n\nU.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to whether they are subject to the Tax on Securities Accounts.\n\nProposed Financial Transactions Tax\n\nOn February 14, 2013, the European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax (FTT) in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (collectively, the Participating Member States).\n\nThe proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in ADSs in certain circumstances. The FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in ADSs where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State.\n\nS-35\n\nA financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, established in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State.\n\nEstonia has declared that it will no longer support the FTT proposal. On April 30, 2016 the FTT proposal was withdrawn by the European Commission. However, such a tax remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia). A new proposal could thus be drafted by the European Commission. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective Holders of ADSs are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.\n\nU.S. Taxation\n\nThe following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders (as defined below) of acquiring, holding and disposing of the ADSs.\n\nThe following discussion applies only to U.S. holders that purchase ADSs, will hold ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment) and that are not residents of, or ordinarily resident in, Belgium for tax purposes nor hold their ADSs as part of a permanent establishment in Belgium. The discussion also does not address any aspect of U.S. federal taxation other than U.S. federal income taxation. In particular, this summary does not address all tax considerations applicable to investors that own (directly or by attribution) 10% or more of our stock by vote or value, nor does this summary discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, certain U.S. expatriates, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, securities traders that elect mark-to-market tax accounting, investors that will hold the ADSs as part of constructive sales, straddles, hedging, integrated or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).\n\nThe following summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder, published rulings of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), the income tax treaty between the United States and Belgium (the U.S.-Belgium Treaty), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, in each case as available on the date of this prospectus supplement. Changes to any of the foregoing, or changes in how any of these authorities are interpreted, may affect the tax consequences set out below, possibly retroactively. No ruling will be sought from the IRS with respect to any statement or conclusion in this discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge such statement or conclusion in the following discussion or, if challenged, a court will uphold such statement or conclusion.\n\nFor purposes of the following summary, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of ADSs that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia), (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (x) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and (y) one or more United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust.\n\nIf a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the partners of such partnership will depend on the\n\nS-36\n\nactivities of the partnership and the status of the partners. A partnership considering an investment in ADSs, and partners in such partnership, should consult their own tax advisers about the consequences of the investment.\n\nWe do not expect to be a PFIC, and the discussion under Distributions by Us and Proceeds from the Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the ADSs below assumes we will not be a PFIC. See Passive Foreign Investment Company discussion below.\n\nProspective purchasers of ADSs should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences to them in their particular circumstances of acquiring, holding, and disposing of, ADSs.\n\nOwnership of ADSs in General\n\nThe discussion below is based, in part, on representations by the Depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, an owner of ADSs generally will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. However, the U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom interests such as the ADSs are delivered in transactions similar to pre-release transactions may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for U.S. holders of ADSs. Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of Belgian taxes could be affected by actions taken by parties to whom the ADSs are pre-released. No gain or loss will be recognized if you exchange ADSs for the ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Your tax basis in such ordinary shares will be the same as your tax basis in such ADSs, and the holding period in such ordinary shares will include the holding period in such ADSs.\n\nDistributions by Us\n\nSubject to the application of the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, the U.S. dollar value of distributions paid by us (including the amount of any taxes withheld) out of its earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will be subject to tax as foreign source ordinary dividend income and will be includible in your gross income upon receipt by the Depositary. However, we do not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax accounting principles. U.S. holders should therefore assume that any distribution by us with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs will constitute ordinary dividend income. Subject to applicable limitations, so long as the ADSs are regularly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we expect that dividends paid by us will be classified as qualified dividend income generally subject to tax at lower rates than other items of ordinary income when received by individuals and other non-corporate U.S. holders. Dividends received on the ordinary shares or ADSs will not be eligible for the dividends received ded"
