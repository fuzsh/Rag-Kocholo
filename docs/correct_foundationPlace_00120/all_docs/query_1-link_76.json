        "text": "April 30, 2014—Materialise NV announced the launch of the latest Mimics Innovation suite, which includes the Mimics 17.0 and 3-matic 9.0 software solutions. The software is used for processing and editing anatomical data from medical images. The updated version includes new time-saving tools, the ability to import three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound data (available in the Research Edition), and two new modules: x-ray and pulmonary.\n\nAccording to the company, the x-ray module allows the analysis of the 3D position of bones and implants at each moment of a patient’s treatment without the expense of multiple multiple resonance imaging scans and unnecessary exposure to high doses of radiation with additional CT scans.\n\nBy combining 3D imaging modalities with x-ray images, engineers can work in the 3D environment they prefer while collaborating with clinicians in the modality that they are most accustomed to using. This combination opens up numerous possibilities, such as comparing 3D preoperative plans with postoperative results to analyze and improve surgical procedures.\n\nAccording to Materialise, the new pulmonary module enables clinicians to derive more anatomical information from lung CT scans. This flexible, fast, and user-friendly solution facilitates the accurate segmentation of the lower respiratory system for advanced research and analyses. Segmenting the pulmonary system has always been possible in Mimics, and the new module offers improved outcome parameters that enable the early detection of diseases and the innovation of options for localized therapies.\n\nWith new import modalities like 3D ultrasound, the Mimics innovation suite facilitates “engineering on anatomy” to acquire a much broader scope, allowing for fully dynamic cardiovascular analyses. Three-dimensional ultrasound is useful for research and development because it is readily available, safe for patients, administered in comfortable positions, less expensive compared to magnetic resonance imaging or CT, and can now be imported into the Mimics Innovation Suite, stated Materialise, which is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium."
