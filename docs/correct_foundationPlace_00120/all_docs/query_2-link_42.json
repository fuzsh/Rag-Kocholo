        "text": "3D printing or Additive Manufacturing?\n\nDoes it actually matter?\n\nWe think it kind of does, but not necessarily in the way that you may think. Or the way others have approached this talking point.\n\nSince this technology sector left its original names of Rapid Prototyping and later Rapid Manufacturing behind, the debate around the terminology: what it should be called and why, has raged on and off for more than a decade. We’ve read and heard the arguments for and against both 3D printing and Additive Manufacturing over the years. Additive manufacturing is, in our opinion, the closest to being technically correct and most accurately covers the broad spectrum of additive processes that fall under its definition — as established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) group ASTM F42 – Additive Manufacturing, in 2010. However, 3D printing undoubtedly gets the popular vote – it is the term most widely used and understood by mainstream press and people outside of the industry.\n\nAnd here lies the hub of the argument — who are we talking to? This is what really matters. The label that is used to describe this manufacturing technology sector is less relevant than how people recognise it. Recognising a term is very different to understanding the technology behind it.\n\nRecognition leads to response and ultimately engagement (the end goal) – whether that is accepting it and embracing it, rejecting it (based on knowledge, judgement or pre-determined ideals) or asking more questions. A lack of recognition prevents engagement — and that is the worst possible outcome.\n\nIn the experience of Addition Design & Research, 3D printing is the recognisable term, one that brings with it myriad of responses.\n\nIn the experience of Addition Design & Research, 3D printing is the recognisable term, one that brings with it myriad of responses. Additive manufacturing on the other hand, is a term that is less recognisable, even if it is more technically correct, particularly outside of the confines of the industry itself, and, we have noted, it rarely generates responses, much less engagement.\n\nWe don’t have empirical data to support this position, just experience that has revealed a pattern. Let’s take the last year or so, when Addition Design & Research has attended and exhibited at numerous events (both large and small) outside of the Additive Manufacturing industry itself — events dedicated to specific vertical sectors, such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, packaging etc. At these events people attend for a variety of reasons, usually specifically related to their company and/or role. We’ve met hundreds of people for whom additive technology is not even featuring on their radar. When we have talked to them about additive manufacturing – there is barely a flicker of recognition for many, and it is something we have to explain at length. However, mention 3D printing and the recognition is immediate. Context and understanding can often be skewed, relevance even more so; but we have a foundation on which to move the conversation forward intelligently.\n\nCorrect terminology and definitions do matter for an industry.\n\nCorrect terminology and definitions do matter for an industry. But so does recognition, awareness and, ultimately, engagement outside of that industry. That’s why 3D printing and Additive Manufacturing, as labels, both matter — it just depends who you’re talking to."
