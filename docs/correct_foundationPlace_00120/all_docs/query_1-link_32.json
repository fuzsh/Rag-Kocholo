        "text": "Materialise and ArcelorMittal Announce Partnership to Enhance Metal 3D Printing Capabilities\n\nMaterialise, a global leader in 3D printing software and services, and ArcelorMittal Powders, a business unit of ArcelorMittal established to produce high-quality steel powders, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to create solutions to optimize laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) equipment and metal 3D printing strategies. Through the MOU, ArcelorMittal will use Materialise‚Äôs next-gen build processor for 3d printers.\n\nThe two companies are partnering to develop solutions that integrate Materialise‚Äôs next-gen build processor and ArcelorMittal Powders‚Äô AdamIQTM range of steel powders to enhance LPBF, the most widely used additive manufacturing technology for producing metal parts. Build processors link 3D printers with data preparation software, streamlining the additive manufacturing process from design to print. Materialise‚Äôs next-gen build processor supports larger build volumes and more complex geometries than traditional build processors, so users will be able to customize process parameters, streamline workflows and print faster. Combined with the AdamIQTM steel powders made specifically for additive manufacturing applications, these printing solutions help improve setup and production speed, part quality, cost-efficiency, reproducibility and repeatability.\n\nThe (silent) killer application of 3D printing is packaging your food\n\nDespite numerous efforts and great expectations in futuristic segments such as alternative meat, chocolate and pasta, food 3D printing has not fully delivered on its initial promises. However, the food industry is also one of the biggest (and quietest) implementation areas for 3D printing. Many 3D printer manufacturers have tried to yell it out to the world that 3D printing can revolutionize the food and beverage industries, but many case studies went unnoticed. Unlike direct 3D printing of food products, the additive manufacturing of food and beverage packaging machinery parts is not as appetizing to the wider public as 3D printed chocolate or a pasta dish but it may be one of the killer applications that drive AM adoption.\n\nThe benefits of using 3D printing to make food & beverage industry machinery work better are self-evident. For one, food processing machines are highly complex mechanical assemblies that can have well over 2,000 components, many of which have to be stored in inventory and, as a result, cannot be modified easily once they are in production. Many of these parts are complex. Or complexity can be added to a part in order to simplify the machine‚Äôs work. This can be done with both metal and polymers, using various different processes and even a wide range of differently priced machines, from professional-level Formlabs and Ultimakers to industrial-level metal PBF and metal binder jetting systems.\n\nPrinting Twins: The agricultural equipment manufacturer developing a digital warehouse of back-up 3D printed parts\n\nSince the start of 2023, CNH has been working with Materialise‚Äôs Mindware additive manufacturing consulting team, assessing how it can grow its additive manufacturing (AM) application to safeguard its supply chain. The company first adopted AM in 2008 for prototyping, and in recent years has begun applying the technology to tooling and spare parts. Functional parts ‚Äì designed with the technology in mind from the start ‚Äì are on the agenda, as is the development of ‚ÄòAM twins‚Äô. Because, another question CNH has been asking itself is, if its supply chain breaks down somewhere, ‚ÄòIs there any backup solution?‚Äô And ‚ÄòCould additive manufacturing be an alternative to the conventional market?‚Äô The answer was yes. Materialise was thus looped into the process of identifying applications that can be manufactured with AM, with the view of designing back-up solutions in case of any supply chain issues.\n\nPeter Ommeslag, Director Supply Chain Manufacturing Systems and Tools for CNH Industrial, anticipates that up to 40% of parts manufactured or provided by CNH could be a fit for AM, with between 80-85 AM twins already designed, pending quality checks. CNH is already using AM to produce 250 different spare parts ‚Äì most of them being polymer components, and most of them being non-critical units like covers, hoods, and pipes ‚Äì but with its AM twins project is now aiming to reinforce its supply chain.\n\nMaterialise, Proponent, and Stirling Dynamics Sign Letter of Intent to Provide Certified 3D-Printed Cabin Solutions\n\nMaterialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS), a global pioneer in 3D printing solutions and services, Proponent, the largest independent aerospace distributor, and Stirling Dynamics, an EASA 21.J-certified Aerospace Design Organization, have announced the signing of a letter of intent (LOI) aimed at providing certified cabin solutions for aircraft.\n\nStirling Dynamics, an Expleo company, strengthens an existing partnership between Materialise and Proponent that was formed in 2021. By combining their unique forces, the three companies can support the aerospace aftermarket with the design, production, and distribution of certified 3D-printed cabin solutions. As an aerospace-approved Design Organization (DOA), Stirling Dynamics develops improved, certified designs for 3D-printed interior cabin parts and provides complete aircraft documentation and installation instructions.\n\nTogether, Materialise, Proponent, and Stirling Dynamics aim to accelerate the adoption of 3D printing for cabin parts. Through the identification and design of smart 3D-printed solutions for OEMs, airlines, and MROs, this partnership seeks to give airline customers the possibility to easily leverage the unique manufacturing benefits 3D printing offers.\n\nHP and Materialise Partner to Drive Volume 3D Printing\n\nAs an HP preferred partner, Materialise will provide the industry with an end-to-end manufacturing solution that is integrated with an additive technology that is designed for productivity and scale ‚Äî MJF and Metal Jet systems. As part of this partnership, HP will help customers identify meaningful use cases for the software platform, as well as showcase the solution at HP demo facilities and public events.\n\nThe seamless connectivity between HP AM technology and Materialise CO-AM enables users to create workflows that improve traceability, quality control, and machine utilization. Optimized 3D print job management allows production leads to track planned and actual printer activities and optimize machine time. To ensure continuous production, real-time machine monitoring provides operators and engineers with critical process data, including build status, material usage, and machine sensor data. This data can be collected and stored in log files of 3D-printed jobs to enhance traceability and quality control. In addition to their 3D printers, Metal Jet users can connect process-relevant HP machinery to the CO-AM platform, such as the Powder Management Station, Curing Station, and Powder Removal Station. This integration allows Metal Jet users to streamline the post-processing of metal parts within the manufacturing process.\n\nMaterialise launches AI tool to save customers time and money\n\nMaterialise, a global leader in 3D printing software and services, has released its Process Control software for metal 3D printing and the Build Processor Software Development Kit (BP SDK). By utilizing automated quality control and configuring their 3D printer parameters, the new technologies enable additive manufacturing (AM) customers to take complete control of the 3D printing process.\n\nAM service providers are pressured to fulfill escalating part quality and cost standards. Monitoring and regulating the 3D printing process is crucial to this endeavor. Still, AM users need the right tools to avoid failed builds, hidden flaws in their parts, and 3D printing settings that don‚Äôt work for AM applications. These problems waste machine time, materials, and post-processing capacity, resulting in extra expenses.\n\nüîè How Secure Is Your Digital Additive Manufacturing Data?\n\nAlthough additive manufacturing doesn‚Äôt inherently bring with it any extreme risks, it can be the first time a manufacturer is faced with digital processes and establishing secure IT systems. ‚ÄúWe work with companies all the time that have a traditional manufacturing line where plans are still on paper, and the data is stored on a local hard drive,‚Äù says Hayes. ‚ÄúImplementing additive allows that company to jump steps ahead in the technology curve, and all of a sudden, they can have digitally connected systems and cloud networks.‚Äù Securing those networks is up to individual organizations, notes Hayes. ‚ÄúThe security of any data inside of that EOS machine is as safe or as vulnerable as that organization‚Äôs overall IT security.‚Äù"
