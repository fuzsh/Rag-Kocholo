        "text": "For fiscal 2024, we will be providing guidance for both our consolidated revenue as well our consolidated adjusted EBIT and will no longer be providing guidance for our consolidated adjusted EBITDA. We believe our consolidated adjusted EBIT will be a more useful guidance measure for investors and analysts going forward as adjusted EBIT includes the periodic cost of capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our business and, as such, will allow for a better assessment of our expected performance. However, we will continue to report the segment-adjusted EBITDA of our three business segments.\n\nMrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded, “Whereas our guidance reflects the uncertain macro-economic and geo-political environment, we believe Materialise is ideally positioned, thanks to our strong product portfolio, continued investments in innovations, and strong financial foundation. We expect sales in all three of our segments to increase. The growth of our Materialise Software revenue will be further temporarily impacted by the transition towards a cloud-based subscription business model that we are continuing to implement. Based on current market conditions, we expect our full-year consolidated revenues to grow by a range of 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR in 2024. The revenue growth will result in an adjusted EBIT, which we currently anticipate to total between 11,000 and 14,000 kEUR. We expect our three segments to contribute to our adjusted EBIT in line with their contributions to our revenue growth.”\n\nMaterialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments, and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, long-term investment, rather than the performance of the company’s day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment-adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company’s indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company’s business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures, and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company’s ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company’s calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company’s presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items."
