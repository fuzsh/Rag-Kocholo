        "text": "Leuven, Belgium – March 27th, 2014. Materialise, a pioneer in the 3D Printing industry, has reached another important milestone in the company's 24-year history by hiring their 1,000th employee.\n\nRebecca Thoppil has joined Materialise's U.S. office, located in Plymouth, Michigan, as a clinical engineer for the company's cranio-maxillofacial team. Rebecca received a master's in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in December 2013, and completed a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Wayne State University in Detroit prior to that.\n\nWhen asked about how she felt about joining the Materialise team, Rebecca responded, \"Ever since high school I had always dreamed of working in the biomedical engineering field, and I am overjoyed that joining Materialise enabled this dream to become a reality. Not only do I get to be a part of an industry that I love and respect, which makes a difference in the lives of so many people, but I get a chance to do this through the application of cutting-edge, innovative technologies.\"\n\n\"I am very proud to see how the company has grown since our humble yet ambitious beginnings 24 years ago,\" says Materialise founder and CEO, Fried Vancraen. \"Of course, this growth would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all those who have worked for Materialise since we began. Materialise is blessed with a dynamic team that consists to a great extent of people who have built their careers mainly at the company, including many key managers who have been with us since our inception. I welcome Rebecca to the Materialise family and promise that we will do our very best to provide her with a motivating environment and ample opportunities to grow and learn as it is thanks to our employees, both new and old, that Materialise can continue to grow and thrive in the years to come.\""
