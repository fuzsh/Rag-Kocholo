        "text": "Observing the tables realized by the Bohemian engraver Wenceslaus Hollar in 1669, during his official visit to the new English colony of Tangier, you get the impression that you are looking at a European town, instead of a settlement on the North African coasts. From an urban perspective, in few years the town acquired features which made it look familiar, in order to reassure those people in England who dreamt of the splendid future the new base would be doomed to. But the reality of the situation was quite another: the orderly appearance of the sloping roof houses, the steady roads and the magnificent bowling court hid all the concerns and fears of a constantly under siege town. A town which every day was compelled to deal with a different world, sometimes obscure, certainly hostile. Stuck between a frequently furious sea harried by corsairs and the fierce ranks of Moroccan sovereigns, the settlers saw their imperial dream changing soon into a sunny nightmare which forced them to leave Tangier after only twenty years of occupation. The city was relegated to the oblivion by the British historiography and only recently historians have taken interest again of this murky chapter about the British colonial events. Indeed it lends itself to numerous considerations about the European perception of Northern Africa, which is so near but so difficult to comprehend and penetrate at the same time. Thanks to the studying of the iconographical material and the correspondence of the English Board of Trade, this presence is an attempt to point out the urban arrangement of the colony and the administrative and social problems concerning the brief history of British Tangier from 1661 to 1684.\n\nIt goes without saying that one significant aspect of intercultural communication which often escapes one’s notice is negotiation. Alongside with its important geopolitical location, Tanger has always been, since a long time, a considerable site for such intercultural negotiation. That Tanger has witnessed and received different cultural elements makes of it a preferable subject-matter for many travelers, story-tellers, anthopoligists and researchers of different cultural background. So, its geographical position has transformaed it into a particular contact zone wherein interesting intercultural activities have taken place, the most important of which is intercultural translation. However, an emerging global cultural economy has opened an attention-grabbing room for reflection about how intercultural translation is shaped and shapes globalization. In this vein, this paper seeks to unveil the poetics and politics of intercultural translation within the global age, with a particular emphisis on American Translations of Moroccan Culture of Tanger during the 1950’s through 1970’s.\n\nThis essay develops key connections along lateral axes with other Moroccan litera- tures written in Castilian/spanish, Catalan, and English through a transcolonial per- spective. The unprecedented social and political developments that are taking place in Morocco today have also generated a renewed interest in the country’s literary production. instead of regarding the writings of Moroccan nationals as part of Maghrebi literature, critics are now becoming more sensitive to the unique features of this literature, against the backdrop of a colonial and postcolonial history that is markedly different from that of the two other countries of the reduced Maghreb: Algeria and Tunisia.1 Literary fiction texts can serve as evidence in a similar fashion as empirically based political or social observations; processes represented within and implicit around fictional works, which can be discerned by a reader or inter- preter, convey a reality or veracity about their geopolitical locations that is germane as[to], say, statistical data or sociological field work or political reports (Gupta, “Literary studies” 873).\n\nIn her article Tangier and Kerouac\\u27s Oriental Experience in Liminality Peggy Pacini discusses Kerouac\\u27s production derived from his Tangerian experience. Since the Tangier narratives have no existence of their own in the Duluoz Legend and are included in larger volumes about traveling and passing through, Pacini examines how this production cohered within the entire Legend and the terminology and world vision Kerouac had already fashioned. Focusing on two texts, Big Trip to Europe and Passing through Tangiers, France and London, Pacini considers Kerouac\\u27s and his alter ego Duluoz\\u27s visions of Tangier and their journey to Tangier as many thresholds or liminal moments that eventually culminate in another rite of passage in their Beat experience. Within the framework of the Legend and of Kerouac\\u27s cosmology and imagery, Pacini addresses what has been overlooked in Kerouac\\u27s Tangier experience and how his encounter with the city is translated in his narratives. She exa...\n\nWhat is Moroccan literature, where and when does it happen, and in what languages? In this essay, we tackle these questions by tracing the evolution of the definition of “Moroccan literature” from the first half of the twentieth century until the present. The earliest works of Moroccan literary historiography, such as ʿAbd Allah Gannūn’s al-Nubūgh al-maghribī fī al-adab al-ʿarabī (1937), situated Moroccan literature within the Arabic literary tradition and treated Moroccan literature as an important element in the “Arab-Islamic” identity promoted by the Moroccan nationalist movement. Since Moroccan independence in 1956, this definition of Moroccan literature has come under increasing pressure, as the languages and imaginative geographies of Moroccan literature have expanded to include new voices. In what follows, we consider these debates through a survey of a diverse corpus of literary-historical works that throw into question the linguistic, temporal, and spatial borders of Moroccan literature (and of Morocco itself)."
