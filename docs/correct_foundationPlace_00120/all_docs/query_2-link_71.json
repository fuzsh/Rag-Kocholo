        "text": "Mid June we introduced the material “prime gray” as a try out for 1 month. Your reactions are clear: you would like to have it available for a longer time. That’s why we extend the testing period with 1 month. On top of that, with every order that you place between now and August 15, you get a free sample of this material. More information about the material can be found here . Tell us what you like or not? This way we can look for materials that suit you better.\n\nLast week I attended the official opening of Ctrl-Z. On a PC, Ctrl-Z is the shortcut for ”undo”. It is also the title of the first large exhibition – curated by Eric van Straaten – in The Netherlands of sculptures by artists using 3D printing.\n\nCtrl-Z features sculptures by Hans van Bentem, Antoinette Briët, Jennifer Hoes, Thomas Huyghe (Belgium), Thomas Laureyssens (Belgium), Stijn van der Linden, Mike Pelletier (Canada), Rinus Roelofs, Theo Schepens, Marc Sokpolie, Eric van Straaten, José van Tubergen, David van der Veldt, Ilse Vermeulen, Hugo Vrijdag, André van de Wijdeven and Rem van der Zee.\n\nHere’s a short impression below:\n\nCtrl-Z @ De Vishal, Haarlem\n\nCtrl-Z\n\nMade by Eric van Straaten\n\nMade by Rinus Roelofs\n\nMade by Ilse Vermeulen\n\nMade by André van de Wijdeven\n\nCtrl-Z\n\nfrom 2 July – 7 August 2011\n\nGrote Markt 20\n\n2011 RD Haarlem\n\nthe Netherlands\n\nI’m saddened to announce that I’m leaving i.materialise. I had a wonderful time at Materialise and I’ll really miss the great and fun team here. I loved working at a place where you were surrounded by such expertise in 3D printing. I also loved walking around and seeing entire car bumpers, bobsleds and prostheses emerge from the many 3D printers here. The knowledge and skill that the staff here use to finish these things still amazes me.\n\nI can only hope that in my time here I’ve been able to transfer some of my knowledge and skills to the people here. I do believe that if we look at the i.materialise website now we have been able to build a solid foundation for continued and future growth. I also know that the guys have a lot of fun surprises and new things in store for you in the coming months! I want to thank you, the community, for all your efforts in helping us improve the site and all the fantastic designs that you have had made with us. It has been truly inspir\n\nToday, for the first time ever, you have the chance to create your own products in gold with i.materialise! We are ecstatic to be the first 3D printing service in the world to offer you the chance to see your creations brought to life in this amazing material. And, if that was not enough, we are also announcing the launch of sterling silver. Our Periodic Table of Materials has never looked so good!\n\n“There’s gold in that thar 3D printing service”\n\nIt has been 183 years since the first Gold Rush hit in the United States and although most of us are no longer racing off to make our fortunes digging in “them thar hills”, the lure of gold and the power it holds over us remains. There is something that sets this metal apart from all others, and mankind has been using gold to fashion their most precious artifacts for thousands of years. Now, through i.materialise, you too can bring amazing designs to life in gold. Whether you design a personalized wedding ring that screams “I love you” or a h\n\nThis is the last part of a five part series on 3D Printing versus Mass Production.

But, in order for 3D printing to be able to equal the manufacturing capability of mass produced cameras would take many years and might never be possible. Better to hack and work with those technologies to use them as Lego blocks to build what you need, right now. Better to be the parasite on the cancer that is mass production. Instead of a Santa that would truly let anyone make anything all the time at home with their own tools and printers it would be a selective Santa. For those who take their time and investigate it can make\n\nThe i.materialise Machine Man Human Augmentation Challenge was inspired by Sci Fi author Max Barry’s book Machine Man. Max, together with other judges, Fab@Home founder and Cornell bio-robotics professor Hod Lipson and 3D printed prosthetic designer Scott Summit have evaluated the submitted designs. They were looking for a design and concept that augmented the human body using 3D printing. They wanted people to imagine a future where human elective implants would be accessible. We wanted a design and a 3D print that would inspire people to be able to imagine such a world. This is the most difficult and ambitious Challenge we”ve ever done and we’re glad that we are able to now announce the winners.\n\nIn third place is the iNose by Miel Wellens\n\nAccording to the judges:\n\n“In this concept, a titanium, subsurface implant lives on the bridge of the nose, allowing eyewear to attach without the need for earpieces. Presumably, the implanted part would be created based on the unique m\n\nThis is a part of a series of posts on 3D printing versus Mass Production.The other parts are: The Power of Unique, Manufacturing Complexity and Marketing Promise, Everything you own Sucks and Wish Fulfillment.\n\nIV. More Beautiful Landfill\n\nMass Production will bring us a world where our landfill is ever more beautiful. We will just keep throwing away prettier, newer & more complex things at ever accelerating rates. We will in fact be hoovering the world’s resources into a self defeating search for happiness through consumption. As marketing and disposable income spread around the world many more people will want and be able to buy mass manufactured goods. The current negative impact on our environment is already noticeable but is only being created by a small segment of the world”s population.\n\nIf we look at OECD statistics we can see the Domestic Material Consumption of the OECD countries (under Environment Material Resources). This is the sum total of all materials extrac\n\nWe”ve evaluated all the designs and chosen the winners of the 3D printed jewlery contest. We were very impressed with the quality and creativity of the works and it was tough work evaluating them, but here are the winners.\n\nIn 3rd place is Unellenu with Chain Necklace.\n\nIn second place is Dario Scapitta Design with Stone.\n\nIn first place is Nexus Chocker by Igor Knezevic.\n\nEach of these designers wins a 3D print of their piece as well as a place in the .MGX Shop. Igor also wins a personal workshop by Elvis Pompilio. In addition to the top 3 we have selected other designs that will also become a part of the Summer 2011 .MGX Jewel Collection. We hope that this serves to not only be a good commercial opportunity for the winning designers but also a great step in their carreers. Thank you so much for all your entries!\n\nWavelet bracelet & Guilloche Necklace bij Igor Knezevic\n\nDiamond inside by Cunicode\n\nStar Grafitti pendant & Chandelier earringsÂ by Unellenu\n\nIn September we will be organizing a workshop in contemporary 3D printed jewelry design at the .MGX flagship store in the Sablon area in Brussels. The 3 day workshop by Karen Wuytens will take place on the 8th, 9th and 16th of September. Participation is free of charge, but limited to ten participants.\n\nKaren is a jewelry designer and PhD-researcher at MAD-Hasselt, who uses 3D printing in her designs. For this she works closely with us here at i.materialise. Karen will share her experience in 3D printed jewelry and take you through the creation of a 3D printed jewelry piece. KarenÂ would like to, “let designers taste the spatial possibilities of thisÂ innovative new technology as well as the acompanyingÂ production and design process.” Noted hat designer Elvis Pompilio will also attend and help give you some insight into his work. Fabien Franzen will also be there in order to give you guidance of the 3D modeling aspects of the workshop. The attending designers will also be given"
