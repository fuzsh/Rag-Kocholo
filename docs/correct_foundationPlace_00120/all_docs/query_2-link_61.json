        "text": "Leuven, Belgium â€“ June 22, 2016. Materialise NV (NASDAQ: MTLS) is pleased to announce the newest version of the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite. This flexible platform of 3D printing software and services enables engineers and researchers to achieve rapid, reliable image segmentation and accurate 3D reconstruction using validated software. Users can now segment medical images faster with new intuitive tools such as a live 3D Mask Preview. Robust algorithms in the finite element analysis mesh preparation workflow allow the user to obtain high-quality meshes with more ease, even in challenging cases.\n\nFaster Segmentation\n\nSegmenting anatomy from a CT or MRI scan is the most labor-intensive part in the process of creating a patient-specific device. That's why the new version of the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite will enable users to perform segmentations faster through a combination of smarter editing tools and a live 3D Preview.\n\nThe Split Tool automatically splits two adjacent tissues by marking the two tissues in a few slices. Besides, it is now possible to alternate between 2D and 3D editing in a single operation. 3D models can also be fine-tuned with a more intuitive Contour Editing. With the help of the live 3D Preview, the user gets immediate feedback on the effect of all these edits on the virtual model, leading to a more streamlined and faster process.\n\nA benchmark study shows the effect of these new functionalities on the segmentation time for various common workflows.\n\nEasier FEA Meshing\n\nFinite element analysis (FEA) not only permits the understanding of anatomical shapes, but also takes into account the patient's activity, which is a crucial element for improving patient satisfaction. In order to make FEA meshing easier, the Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite 19 contains new robust algorithms, a user-friendlier interface, and a better interaction with FE solvers.\n\nThanks to the new uniform mesh algorithm, the triangle quality has been improved and the results require far less calculation time, even for the most complex geometries. In addition, a new non-manifold assembly algorithm was introduced, making it easier to combine multiple parts, such as a bone and an implant, in a single mesh.\n\nThe resulting high-quality meshes are ready to be used in the most common commercially available solvers, preventing users from having to iterate multiple times between different software packages. With these improvements, it will be easier for a novice to get started with FEA meshing, while experienced users will be able to complete more challenging cases in less time.\n\n\"The grid system non-manifold assembly is a potential game changer. I will no longer have to spend hours or even days on getting complex meshes ready for FEA. This is a dream come true\", comments Dr. Jonathan Ford from the University of South Florida, USA.\n\nBe sure to visit the website for more information on the latest features.\n\nAbout Materialise\n\nMaterialise incorporates more than 25 years of 3D printing experience into a range of software solutions and 3D printing services, which together form the backbone of the 3D printing industry.
