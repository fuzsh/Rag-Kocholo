        "text": "Materialise NV (NASDAQ: MTLS) is proud to announce at formnext that the Korean 3D printer manufacturer Carima will bundle the recently launched Materialise Magics Print software to their line of Digital Light Processing printers. Materialise Magics Print is a flexible new product that allows 3D printer manufacturers to offer data preparation solutions to their customers, making it possible to repair files and prepare them for printing in a much more simple and efficient way.\n\nTest results from Materialise’s DLP Technology Centre of Excellence in Malaysia indicated that users of Materialise Magics Print will be able to prepare their models on average twice as fast and the usage of the patented auto-scaffold support structures will reduce the support removal time by up to 82% compared to conventional support generation software. The collaboration between Materialise and Carima is another step forward towards better control of the 3D printing process for DLP machine users.\n\nCarima’s customers are situated in the jewelry, dental and prototyping market, and as such, they are looking for stable and powerful data preparation software that allows them to make their designs 3D printable. As of January, Carima will make Materialise Magics Print available to all users of their Master EV machine, as well as the next generation of these machines: DM200 and DM250.\n\n“We are happy to actively work with machine manufacturers like Carima to enable the user of their machines to get the most out of 3D printing technology. By bundling part of our open and neutral software backbone with their machines, we combine each other’s strength and expertise,” explains Stefaan Motte, Vice President of Software at Materialise.\n\n“At Carima, we are proud to offer high-quality printers as well as great service, and fulfilling the needs of our customers is our number one priority.
