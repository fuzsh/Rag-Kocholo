        "text": "The Kartilya comprises thirteen lessons that detail not only the vision of the Katipunan, but the vision for a egalitarian and morally sound Filipino nation.\n\nFor the Katipunan leadership, such as Emilio Jacinto, the ideas of Right and Light, Katwiran and Kaliwanagan, were of utmost importance. They saw themselves as not only as inheritors of the Age of Enlightenment, but intellectual and moral revolutionaries fighting to create and define a nation and culture that was post-Enlightenment; that was no longer shackled by the ideological and colonial restraints of the West, but a country that adopted and merged the best of Spain, the United States, France, and our own unique culture and society, in support of being Filipino.\n\nWhich makes me wonder, for all those who use the Katipunan as an ideological touchstone, for all those who say they are the inheritors of the Katipunan's ideals, how many have actually read, internalized, and understood the Kartilya?\n\nOutside of obliquely and directly referencing it, that is.\n\nThe Kartilya of the Katipunan\n\nA life that is not consecrated to a large and holy greatness is a tree without shade, if not a poisonous weed.\n\nGood work that comes from selfish desires and not from a true desire for excellence is not kindness.\n\nReal piety is hard work and love for fellowmen, and measuring each action, labor and speech by true Reason.\n\nWhether one's skin be black or white, all people are equal; it may be that each is superior in knowledge, wealth, beauty but there is no superiority in human dignity.\n\nOne who has a high inner spirit, puts honor, goodness and virtue before self-interest; one who has a lowly inner spirit puts self interest before honor, goodness and virtue.\n\nTo the person with shame, his or her word is sacred.\n\nDo not waste time: wealth can be lost and recovered; but time that already passes will not pass again.\n\nDefend the oppressed and fight the oppressor.\n\nThe intelligent person is one who is careful in all that he or she says; and learns to keep secret that which should deb kept in confidence.\n\nOn the thorny path of life, man is the guide of woman and of children; if the guide leaded to evil, the destiny of those being led is also evil.\n\nThou must not look upon woman as a mere plaything, but as a partner and sympathetic companion in the hardships of this life; in your strength, consider her weakness, and remember the mother who birthed thee and reared thee.\n\nWhat thou dost not desire done unto thy wife, children, and siblings, do not do unto the wife, children, and siblings of others.\n\nThe value of a person is not in being sovereign, not in an aquiline nose or in a white face, it is not in the priestly SUBSTITUTE FOR GOD, nor is it in the high station one has in life. Pure and truly highly esteemed, beloved and noble is the person even if he or she was raised in the forest and speaks nothing but his or her own language; who has beautiful behavior, and only one sentence (which is) honor and virtue; who does not oppress others or allow one's self to be oppressed; who knows how to be sensitive and knows how to cherish the land of his birth.\n\nConsidering the Katipunan, the Revolution, and the Path of Reason.\n\nThe Kartilya was the moral and intellectual foundation used to guide the actions of Katipuneros. Upon joining the Katipunan, members were required to read the Kartilya and adhere to its code of conduct. Changing the way people thought and acted was paramount to the early Katipuñeros; they understand that was the only way to truly change the Philippines for the better. Play-acting as and implicitly referencing the Katipunan without fully understanding their political and moral context and goals essentially degrades the breadth of what they were trying to achieve.\n\nThen again, we always forget that the Katipunan, upon inception and in action, was not the mass movement it is commonly mooted as, but one of the middle class, even the upper middle class. In the context of 19th century Philippines, these men were highly educated and socially mobile. They were critically thinking, well read, and (in some cases) well traveled individuals who conceptualized a new Philippines. One founded on egalitarianism, even while recognizing that social differences will exist.\n\nOf course the Katipunan was not the only organization working towards independence. They built on the ideological and political foundation constructed by men and women who sacrificed much for their dreams of independence. They were not an organization that sprung fully formed from among the masa, nor were they an organization that operated independently of contemporaries and predecessors.\n\nThe actual lessons of the Revolution, the hard work of reformism, the need to define politically and ideologically end goals, the paramount urgency of education and inculcating broader values, is ignored in favor of the Adoration of Revolt, the Cult of the Revolutionary, the Primacy of Personality. I would argue that our misunderstanding of the 19th century feeds directly into some of the public factionalism and fracturing we witness today. What is in interesting is when studying the works of Emilio Jacinto, Apolinario Mabini, Marcelo H del Pilar, and (most importantly) Jose Rizal, we discover exhortations towards intellectualism, not just militancy and violence. In many cases, such as with Rizal, he pushes the need to change the way Filipinos critically think and engage with issues before armed revolt. It is a distinction that is either glossed over or outright ignored in many of today's texts. These men were intellectual giants who espoused a new understanding citizenship and engagement that eludes us still. The shame is they understood that lasting change takes place in the hearts and minds of men first, and what they subsequently build after. Not in spontaneous displays of strength of arms, the might of the sword, and the fleeting nature of purely personality based revolutionary action. We seemingly favor the latter, while forgetting the former.\n\nThere are clear connections between the Revolution, the Katipunan, the Reformist Movement, the events in 1872, the Assembly of Reformists in 1863, the Carlist Movement in Spain, the Latin American revolutions, the Mutiny of 1823, the socio-economic reforms of Jose Basco y Vargas, the economic explosion of the 19th century, and even the British Invasion. The connections stretch back even to the decision in the Manila Synod of 1582 to retain local languages. Context is key, it is critical whether looking at history or contemporary issues.\n\nAnd it also teaches patience. Understanding context helps explain the hows and whys of developments on a local and national level. Ignoring context breeds contempt and impatience for the need to build movements and institutions. Ignoring context is counter-productive to building stability and contemporary unity. It means we look for shortcuts, we seek the paths of least resistance. We reach for revolt without understanding the importance of reform. And yes, it means we see personality as the solution to solving issues, instead of interrogating issues and offering cooperative policy and institutional based options.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of historical and contemporary context, maintaining that level of intellectual rigor, also allows for disparate ideas to be held by individuals and organizations. 'Unity' does not mean homogeneity in thought and belief. That is imperialism and elitism, fascism and tribalism, masquerading as egalitarianism.\n\nOne of the most bothersome and debilitating aspects of contemporary Philippines discourse is our out of hand dismissal of any who hold ideas that differ from ours. It speaks to shallowness: The shallowness with which we understand issues and the concurrent shallowness in engaging issues. Far too often we deploy ultimatums in place of discussion.\n\nThere is almost always an implicit yearning for a resurgence in public intellectualism whenever I write. A desire for an improvement in how we engage each other in discussion. It is a tacit reaction to out of hand dismissals; to branding any who disagree with you as a troll or deploying ad hominem attacks and ultimatums. Quality of thought is not demonstrated through the ease of dismissal, but the depth of discourse. Admittedly, I fall into that trap as well. There is a seductive ease in deploying agit-prop and vilifying people who disagree with you. To outright dismissals of differing ideas. Sometimes it is necessary, sometimes it is understandable and appropriate (especially when engaging with pure propagandists). Then again, there is a difference between people who are willing to engage, and those are focused solely on agitating and inflaming. There is a balancing act in understanding with whom you can engage and with whom you cannot, but a willingness to try is necessary at the onset. So yes, it is a continuing and on-going struggle: The interrogation of assumptions, the willingness to critically engage in terms of methodology and ideology. In other words, to echo Jacinto, the attempt to adhere to true Reason.\n\nMaybe that is the the enduring lesson and challenge of the Kartilya and Katipunan, of the Revolution and Republic, of Rizal, of Aguinaldo and Bonifacio. The intriguing idea that we have to evolve past resorting consistently to superficially structured armed revolt and uprising, of militancy, intransigency, and violence, but learn to seek higher ideals of Reason, and Right and Light, and utilize them in favor of a greater purpose, dedicated to an enlightened concept of Filipinas."
