        "text": "Through the work being done with Mimics, Mr. Vancraen identified the potential to use additive manufacturing to further patient-specific healthcare. Over the course of the past 25 years, this has resulted in a large variety of solutions for surgeons, hospitals, implant and medical device companies, as well as biomedical researchers and institutes. Materialise medical software solutions allow surgeons or researchers to convert medical image data into an accurate, virtual 3D model, which they can use to augment their analyses, designs and modeling.\n\nSurgiCase CMF and SurgiCase Orthopaedics, along with laser sintered surgical guides and anatomical models brought patient-specific treatment to new levels. Through the solutions offered by Materialise, surgeons and clinicians are able to collaborate with experts in the company to create and adapt surgical plans, find creative solutions to difficult cases, and put the plans into action in the operating room. These capabilities led to an exciting project in 2005 when Mr. Vancraen launched RP4Baghdad, a philanthropic mission which brought the advantages of these solutions to civilian victims of the Iraq war. Eventually, the acquisition of OBL in 2007 broadened expanded Materialise’s repertoire to include titanium implants for cranio-maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery and plastic surgery.\n\nIn addition, Materialise pioneered the use of 3D printing for consumer goods through .MGX by Materialise, a celebrated line of high-end design products created in collaboration with some of the greatest names in design today. .MGX creations have featured in top design publications, have made their way into the permanent collections of world-class museums including the MoMA in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and have an ever expanding collection of prestigious awards to their credit.\n\nSoon after growing into a company of over 1 000 employees in June 2014, Materialise announced its initial public offering. Within the year, the company made strides of growth in all three business areas — engineering, medical and consumer applications — with the acquisition of leading Polish prototyping center e-Prototypy, the acquisition of OrthoView, market-leading 2D digital pre-operative planning provider for orthopaedic surgeons, and the launch of the initiative ‘Ideas Worth Making’ to encourage educational applications of 3D printing.\n\nIn recognition of Mr. Vancraen’s and Materialise’s many contributions to the 3D printing industry as well as others, Mr. Vancraen has received a number of awards over the years. In May 2011, Mr. Vancraen received the prestigious RTAM/SME Industry Achievement Award. The award was developed to recognize an individual, team or company for outstanding accomplishments that have had significant impact within the additive manufacturing industry or in any industry through the application of 3D printing technologies. This award confirmed Mr. Vancraen’s role as a game changer in the AM industry. Furthermore, with this extra encouragement, he is more committed than ever to spreading the benefits of 3D printing technology, creating a truly better and healthier world.\n\nHe was again recognized as a leader in the additive manufacturing industry in June 2012 when TCT Magazine placed him in the top position for their list of the Top 20 People in AM/3D Printing. Likewise, the Financial Times listed him as one of the 5 leading players in the industry on 15 June 2012. He was also the recipient of a 2013 Visionaries! Award from the Museum of Art and Design in New York, and of a sign of honor from the Flemish government in 2015 in recognition of his contribution to the image of Flanders. And now the Henry van de Velde Company Award 2015!"
