Leuven, Belgium based 3D printing company Materialise NV filed with U.S. regulators on Wednesday to raise about $125 million in an initial public offering of American Depositary Shares, Reuters reports.

The company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a filing that Piper Jaffray and Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters of the offering.

Materialise was founded in 1990 as the first 3D Printing Service Bureau in the BENELUX (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) region. Since then, it has grown to become not only a provider of sophisticated 3D Printing services, but also a leading developer of additive manufacturing software. The company has 1,000 employees worldwide.
