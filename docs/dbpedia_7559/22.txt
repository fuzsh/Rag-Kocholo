Jean Lannes (1769-1809) was one of Napoleon's most illustrious generals. In 1800, he led the French forces to victory over the Austrian army at Montebello, a town in northern Italy. Four years later, he was appointed a marshal of France, and, after commanding the victorious French army at the battle of Friedland, he was made Duke of Montebello.
