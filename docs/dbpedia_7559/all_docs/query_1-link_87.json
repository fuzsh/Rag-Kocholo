        "text": "Post by Archduke Charles on\n\nThe AI is very different in European War 3, it is actually very smart, and this im going to explain in depth. We need to understand how our opponents work and handle before we can go to action. In order to come to conclusion we most concentrate fully on learning our enemies advancements only then we can crack their code, and eventually predict their move. If you find any contradictions or want to add some further point to my analyse feel free to post in the thread. Im interested in updating it when possible.\n\nAI:\n\nWorks like computers, when they see a possibility they think one or two turns before acting, when knowing this you need to act fast and flank your opponent when possible. The AI usually attacks in a certain unknown pattern, distraction is a normal strategy they use to defend their second front of conflict, a tactic Germany uses. (Both in ww1, and ww2) And now im talking about European War 3.\n\nTargets:\n\nThe AI works this way when attacking and conquering a tile they usually dont care about it, leaving a blank, undefended tile. \"Veni, Vidi, Vici!\" As Gaius Julius Caesar said about his victories against Pharnaces II of Pontus in the battle of Zela. Transelated from Latin to english that is \"I Came, I Saw, I Conquered\" That is how the AI work when they attack, they abandon tiles with no industry or city, and create paths to the enemy capital. And the standard procedure of the AI is spawning a random unit in their capital, equipping it with general, and then make it defend there for the rest of the game. (There is a small chance that they attack nearby enemies when they see a possibility)\n\nUsual Acts of Army Movement (UAAM):\n\n(Playable nations that I analysed on their general acts)\n\nOttoman Empire: In the first 10 turns, they will create horses and cheap infantery to attack the balkan area, they do this by adding a CARRIER card on their miltary units. Their secondary focus is Russian Empire, they will from time to time send units to Crimea, but they always get backfired by artillery. Third focus is defence, this is usually an act they do very rarely but its their last focus. Play a offensive role the whole game.\n\nRomania: Focus on attacking Bulgaria, and are somewhat friendly with Russia. Tend to attack or deffend against Astro-Hungary, and they will defend against Bulgaria. Their movement will be attacking Bulgaria, Serbia and Astro-Hungary, and sometimes Russia. Play a defencive role the whole game.\n\nBulgaria: Focus on attacking Serbia, Their \"friend\" are actually the Ottoman Empire, however they sometimes come in conflict. Their movement are focused west into Serbia and Astro-Hungary. Play a defencive role the whole game.\n\nSerbia: Focused on staying alive, and attacking Bulgaria. Are mostly attacked by Astro-Hungary and thats why they usually get crushed, Their movements are into Bulgaria and Astro-Hungary. They have a defencive role in the whole game.\n\nAstro-Hungary: Focuses on the balkans, Russia and Italy. They are often surronded by enemies and they tend to crack by this. Although as Astro-Hungary does, The balkans falls in on the first priority and Russia second. They are very interested in capturing the northern part of Italy, however they have their mainforce south. Their movements are in balkan area towards Ottoman Empire. They have a offensive role in the whole game.\n\nItaly: Have a very isolated starting location, forexample they are not often attacked by their neigbours because they only have one front and one enemy. Their main focus is on attacking Astro-Hungary and upgrading cities in that area. Main movements are towards the East, into Astro-Hungary, and into Vienna.\n\nSpain: As Italy they also have a very isolated starting location, they have no close enemy nearby. And act as a part of the central power alliance, this is because they attack or get attacked by France. I have not done any research about Spain yet but it was Neutral in ww1 so making Spain allied with Germany was a mistake. Their focus is on attacking French cities and advancing into England, or Italy. Main movements are towards the North into France and England.\n\nFrance: France is basically in a very bad position, rivals on two sides, and no allies that connects them over land. Their main focus is to defend the South against Spain and the East against Germany. They tend to lose fast in east, and retreating to south. Main movements are towards Germany in East, and Spain in South.\n\nUnited Kingdom: The UK are in a very good position, they have tons of navy units to defend Benelux and they are prepared for a deployment in France, to support France in their war against Germany. Their main focus is to weaken Germany and Defend France. Their main movements are towards the South and East using CARRIERS.\n\nGerman Empire: Germany is the most powerful nation in the game, they have only one front were the real action happens, and in the east, Russia will not have as many soliders. Their main focus is to push into Belgium and Netherlands (Schlieffen Plan) and then further advance into France. Their movements are towards the West.\n\nRussian Empire: The Russia empire is the third most powerful nation in the game after Germany and UK. They border two big powers (Astro-Hungary and Germany) and are therefore mainly focused on attacking them. Their focus are creating defence at Baltikum, and to attack Germany. And movements are against the West which are their only direction their enemy are.\n\nThis thread was meant to show everyone how each individual nation in European War 3 works. My hopes is that everyone got an in depth explanation of how the AI works in EW3, the way the AI acts are scripted and are very easy to attack when you know the pattern. Good day to everyone."
