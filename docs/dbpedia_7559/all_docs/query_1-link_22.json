        "text": "It’s now week eleven of #MarshalMonday (I was genuinely astonished when I counted them up to realise I’d been doing it that long) and today’s subject is one of the really big hitters of the Napoleonic Era. Today I’m looking at the marshal whose personal loyalty to Napoleon was absolute, and whose death reduced the Emperor to tears: Marshal Jean Lannes.\n\nConsistently ranked – along with Andre Massena and Louis-Nicolas Davout – as one of Napoleon’s best and ablest marshals, Lannes was born in 1769 at Lectoure. He was the son of a Gascon merchant and small landowner and in his teens was apprenticed to a dyer. Lannes was clearly always meant for a for a more adventurous life than this though and when the Revolution broke out, he enlisted as a volunteer and first saw action against Spain. Here he received what was to be the first of many wounds. From Sept – Dec 1793, he was rapidly promoted up through the ranks from lieutenant to chef de brigade.\n\nIn 1795 the Spanish signed a peace treaty with post-Terror France. Lannes then transferred to the Army of Italy where he soon became a good friend of the rising young General Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw him promoted to general de brigade. Napoleon’s faith in Lannes was ultimately well rewarded, for the future marshal’s career in Italy was extraordinary; showcasing both an intrinsic talent and exceptional courage.\n\nAt Lodi, Lannes was one of the officers who led the bold assault across the bridge; at Bassano he personally took two enemy flags. At the battle of Arcola, he was wounded and knocked out before being dragged to safety by his men. When he came round and realised that the battle was still ongoing, Lannes brushed aside the concerned doctors, took a horse and rode back to the battle to be wounded for a second time!\n\nHe served well in Egypt – taking yet another wound at the battle of Abukir – and was one of the few officers chosen to return with Napoleon to France in 1799. When Napoleon became First Consul, Lannes continued to address him as ‘tu’ rather than ‘vous’; always speaking to Napoleon with the honesty of a friend (whether Napoleon wanted it or not!). He was at that time head of the consular guard and ensured Napoleon’s personal safety. Indeed, he was accompanying Napoleon when the Christmas Eve assassination attempt failed on the way to the opera.\n\nNapoleon briefly made Lannes an ambassador to Portugal, but this was not the best avenue for his friend’s talent and he was soon back on the field again. He was instrumental at Marengo, where Napoleon awarded him a sabre of honour, and was tenth on the list of Marshals of the Empire once Napoleon was crowned. His career continued to thrive – he distinguished himself at Ulm, Austerlitz, Saalfield & Jena. In 1808, Napoleon made him Duke of Montebello.\n\nJean Lannes’ luck eventually ran out in 1809. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, he was talking with General Pouzet when that man was gruesomely killed by a cannonball, reportedly splattering Lannes with his blood. Shaken by this, Lannes walked away and sat down alone with his hands over his face to regain control of his emotions. He was then struck by a cannonball himself, which smashed into his legs.\n\nDragged to safety, one of his legs was immediately amputated, while the other was left to heal. Napoleon rushed to his friend and, in tears, embraced him where he lay. But unfortunately infection had set in and Lannes died several days later. Napoleon was genuinely and absolutely devastated.\n\nMarshal Lannes was initially buried at Les Invalides but in 1810 his remains were later moved to the Pantheon, where they still lie today under a swathe of French flags.\n\nOn St Helena, Napoleon reflected of his friend: “He was certainly a man capable of changing the whole course of events by his own presence and influence” and stated that he could never have imagined Lannes ever deviating from the path of honour.\n\nA Temper To Be Reckoned With\n\nIt was not just on the battlefield that Lannes showed his ferocity. He was known for having a fearsome temper in civilian life too. After once being kept too long waiting for a meeting with Napoleon, who had overrun in a meeting with an émigré, Lannes stalked off in a huff but not before picking up a footstool and using it to shatter a mirror.\n\nHis temper also led him into major clashes with some of his fellow marshals. Not long before the battle of Austerlitz, it was discovered that the two Russian forces had united; which did not bode well for the French. Marshals Soult and Murat convinced Lannes that the only sensible option was to fall back, and that – as Napoleon tended to listen to Lannes more than anyone else – Lannes should be the one to explain it to their leader. Lannes agreed, and explained accordingly to Napoleon. Napoleon pronounced himself amazed that Lannes would ever suggest retreat, after which Soult and Murat suddenly advocated attacking. Lannes erupted in fury, swearing angrily and challenging them, but Napoleon would not permit duels.\n\nThis was not the only inter-marshal duel almost fought by Lannes. Shortly before his death, Lannes overheard Bessieres (who’d been placed under his command) complaining to Colonel Mabot about his conduct to a superior officer, which the marshal attributed to Lannes’ orders, and proclaiming that he ought to demand satisfaction of his colleague. Lannes once again spectacularly lost his temper and told Bessieres that he was more than willing to give him the duel he wanted, even going so far as to draw his sword there and then. It was only through Massena’s intervention that the duel never happened.\n\nTrivia\n\nLannes once hoped to marry Caroline Bonaparte, the (if I can be forgiven a personal opinion) least pleasant of Napoleon’s sisters. In the end though, she chose to marry Joachim Murat.\n\nLannes had five children with his second wife and still has direct descendants alive today. One of these is Philippe Lannes de Montebello, who for several decades was the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York."
