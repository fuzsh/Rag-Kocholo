        "text": "By Roberto A. Scattolin, Italy\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe 1809 Battle of Essling created an appalling renommée (i.e. fame) during the Napoleonic Wars, which was due to the fact that it was one of the bloodiest and most costly to France’s aggressive expansionism in troops and officers. The memoirs of an officer of the Empire, Jean-Baptiste-Antoine-Marcelin de Marbot (a native of Altillac, castle of La Rivière, August 18, 1782), vividly depicts what warfare in the early XIXth Century was really like and its heavy toll in human life.\n\nMany contemporary scholars believe that Napoleon became insensitive to the tremendous losses that his tactics and strategic applications cost in men and materiel – he thought his superior military experience and étoile (i.e. star, a figurative meaning for destinée: destiny) would overcome all odds. In the early years of his amazing military career, he did prevail over many obstacles and triumphed in battles (Arcole, Rivoli, Marengo) that most generals would not have won. Perhaps his most daring maneuvers, and unexpectedly successful outcomes, made him overconfident in the latter years of his military supremacy.\n\nA further point of remark is that as the emperor grew older, gained weight and suffered from various health issues, he was not quite as brilliant or stunning a strategist that he was in the masterful offensive campaigns of his youth (Italy: 1796-1797; 1800). Although Napoleon always studied international strategic assets and was well-prepared for battle emergencies, in the Iberian Peninsular theatre he was never able to suitably conform the French fighting techniques to the realities of social character and address Spain’s effective guerrilla warfare. He erred in not carefully planning for the campaign in Spain.\n\nThe premature death of Marshal Lannes and other prominent personalities of his General-Staff greatly affected the structural organization of the once powerful Grande Armée. These irreplaceable losses weakened the army’s effectiveness and the pillars of leadership in the final period (1809-1815) of military struggle – and lacking talent and adroit (i.e. skilful, clever) general officers were detrimental to the image of French military invincibility (Russia, 1812), strategic proficiency (Germany, 1813), and homeland invulnerability (1814; the Allies invaded France, and moved into Paris the last day of March).\n\nIn studying European history from the year 1796 to 1815, one can assume that the mighty French autocrat had a penchant (i.e. fondness, weakness, tendency) for raising war; he enjoyed the maneuvering, the mind games with his opponents, and pulling victory from near defeat. A dedication to the art of military matters and “born” to lead is what makes for successful commanders, regardless of the epoch they lived in. Confidence and unbounded arrogance are often traits that are most exhibited by those intrepid leaders of the military.\n\nThrough the passing of the centuries, there have been exceptional war-lords who spent their lifetime under trying circumstances of political survival, and sustained stoutly-fought armed confrontations throughout their campaigns of conquest and strategic annexations – to name a few, the son of Philip II, the Macedonian monarch Alexander III (356 B.C.-323 b.C.), nicknamed the Mégas Aléxandros (the Great Alexander); the Carthaginian Hannibal Barca (248-183 B.C.); the outstanding political and military Roman leader and dictator perpetuo named Gaius Julius Caesar (July 13, 100 b.C.-March 15, 44 b.C.); Attila (406 a.C.-453 a.C.), known as Attila the Hun, who mightily ruled the confederation of the Hunnish tribes from 434 until his death; the rex Francorum Charlemagne (April 2, 742-January 28, 814), who was crowned Imperator Augustus by the Pontiff Leo III (December 25, 800 A.D.); the founder and ruler of the Mongol Empire: Temujin (i.e. Chinggis Khaan, 1162 a.C.-1227 a.C.); the Turko-Mongol military leader Tēmōr (Timur, Tamerlane, April 6, 1337-February 19, 1405), who was actually the founder of the Timurid Empire and Timurid dynasty in Central Asia; Friedrich der Große (Berlin, January 24, 1712-Potsdam, August 17, 1786), aka Friedrich II, King of Prussia (1740-1786).\n\nSome were despots, others helped instead to liberate people and countries from despots.\n\nThe Post-Revolutionary (1789) clash of empires and social upheaval brought the towering figure of Napoleon strutting across the stage of history as a brutal autocrat, bringing turmoil to continental Europe.\n\nAs an ambitious analyst of the campaigns of the great captains of the past, Napoleon believed that “knowledge of grand tactics is gained only by experience and by the study of history of the campaigns of all great captains”.\n\nThe failure – of true knowledge – was incommensurable; and Napoleon was at war for all but fourteen months (peace with all countries lasted from March 1802 to May 1803) of the almost fifteen years he was in power. He was the kind of parvenu (i.e. social climber) and man of action (1799, coup d’ état du 18 brumaire) who emerged from the ashes of the French Revolution after the fall of the French monarchy, to gain power in Europe as a ruthless conqueror.\n\nTwo hundred years after the clash at Essling, historians still are writing about Napoleon; discussing, arguing and examining what should or could have been done in this epic battle. Is there any other historic military figure that so many writers have examined in such detail? And with such passion?\n\nIn the wake of post-modern historical studies, the Italian historian provides a more in-depth essay related to the battle contingencies at Essling, keeping intact his punctiliousness and rigorous research for documentary sources and material. Scholarship and a penetrating analysis are both coupled together in a finely detailed, comprehensive analytical study, reflecting the dictum: it is the small, and insignificant details of a topic that makes for interesting study.\n\nBy focusing on the experiences of a French officer who actively served through the line of bravery, the author gives a portrait of the true horror and chaos of Napoleonic warfare, presenting a refreshingly comprehensive investigation and bringing facts into a powerful breath d ’épopée.\n\nClarity in style and argument mark a significant contribution to understanding early XIXth century European history and the strategic applications in the 1809 Austrian campaign.\n\nDedicatum est. To the Fallen in Battle: Austrians, French, and Those Known only to God\n\nEpoch making conflicts greatly impacted the nature of Napoleonic power and notably marked the beginning of early XIXth Century life, influencing the social relationships in politics which not only transcended France, but changed the course of history over most part of European countries. Napoleon’s amazing military campaign of aggression, which stamped his ambitious personality during an era of great events, saw the mighty attrition of the French invading forces opposed by the ruling monarchy of the Habsburgs in the pivotal epic of 1809. One of the toughest conflicts during this period occurred at the Battle of Essling,[1] which based on the grounds of martial challenge was deemed to be Napoleon’s first défaite militaire (i.e. military defeat) on the Continent.\n\nDocumentary piece\n\nOn the first day of the battle of Essling the Austrians had captured the village of that name, and the French regiment which had been posted there was retiring in some disorder before a much superior force, when, being sent to that point by Marshal Lannes, I learned that the colonel had just been killed.\n\nThe officers and men, resolved to avenge him and retake Essling, had, under the command of the major, promptly re-formed their ranks, still under fire, at no great distance from the houses.\n\nI hastened to tell the marshal the state of affairs; but when I said in a low voice “The colonel is dead”, Napoleon, who was close by, frowned, uttering a “Hush!” which made me silent; and though unable to explain to myself how he proposed to improve the occasion, I could see that for the moment he did not wish to know that the colonel was killed.\n\nThe Emperor, who has been accused of lacking physical courage, galloped off, in spite of the bullets which were whistling round us, reached the centre of the regiment, and asked where the colonel was.\n\nComment: Unbothered by the withering fire and the whistling of lead bullets, the prompt intervention of Napoleon apparently was characterized by an impulse of daring. Nevertheless his esprit d’ initiative (i.e. spirit of enterprise), the urge of his personal transcendence and invigorative rush, were not resolved by the unfolding battle operations.\n\nNapoleon’s calculated behaviour proved to be a failure: a threatened gap: a leak in the line left open by the retreat of a severely smashed French infantry unit (a significant element of analysis is indicated by the fact that the companies had abandoned the houses of Essling after having been badly mauled; the disarrangement of the troops was not negligible and was a prejudicial factor to the present status of maneuver of the battalions, urgently requiring coordinated action and back-up support).\n\nThis unexpected development meant that the Commander-in-Chief had a well-defined aim to achieve, otherwise he would not have unnecessarily imperilled his own life. All had a precise intent: fearing the contagious influence of this retour en arrière (i.e. backwards shifting) on the morale of his army, he had to stop the tactical displacement of the regiment; and a purpose was evident: to soon close the dangerous leak in the line of fighting. Nothing was dictated by generosity, and all was conditioned by strategic ground movement. The quintessence of warfare was easily at hand. As Bonaparte asked for monsieur le Colonel, it seemed he had to impart new effective dispositions to reverse this obnoxious military impasse.\n\nAnother consideration was that Napoleon had come to relieve the tension of a drama that had paid exceedingly in bloodshed; and, second, to relieve the psychological effect on his battalions, by bringing his persona to serve during the hottest part of the contest, amid the center (front line) of the regiment. This was a vibrant scene – it gave fresh confidence to the troops and reflected the majestic effect Napoleon’s speech imposed on his troops.\n\nNo one replied, till Napoleon having repeated the question, several officers answered, “He has just been killed”.\n\n“I did not ask if he was dead, but where he is”.\n\nThen a timid voice announced that he had been left in the village.\n\n“What, soldiers!” said Napoleon.\n\n“You have left your colonel’s body in the hands of the enemy? Know that a brave regiment should always be able to show its eagle and its colonel, dead or living. You have left your colonel in that village; go and find him”.\n\nThe major, catching Napoleon’ s thought, cried, “Yes, we are dishonoured, if we do not bring our colonel!” and off he went at the double.\n\nComment: Very few military leaders had that close martial connection with soldiers like Napoleon did in moments of bitter confrontation against overwhelming enemy troops. At the critical juncture now that the French supremacy in the sphere of strategic applications was suddenly challenged by an unfavourable turn and unpredictable circumstances – in leadership and manoeuvre –, Napoleon examined ongoing bouts in the fight-line, each of which stood as a haunting warning to what could be waiting against a recoiling régiment d’ infanterie de ligne (i.e. infantry regiment of the line).\n\nDriven back from the line of fire, it was more than an appealing shock to the troop to know that the pére du régiment (i.e. father of the regiment), the commanding officer who held executive position and field responsibilities of Colonel (i.e. colonel), had perished under heavy enemy fire.[2] Unsuccessful attempts to re-establish the sort of the arms ended in violence and chaos; thus the French soldiers fell into psychological despondency.\n\nA quagmire of desperation and tactical promiscuity followed in the disarrayed ranks; the death of the regiment commander had caused a lethal blow, clipping the wings of victory – and consequentially any further élan (i.e. dash) on the line of honour was broken. Under trying circumstances, it was disappointing that the unexpected check occurred to the French battalions, that was destroying Napoleon’s timetable, and therefore quite a concern to his mighty military reputation and seemingly frustrated design – and the man causing the complaint was the French empereur. However, the terrific circumstances of the fighting were stark against all odds, and the Austrian field units had put up protracted tenacious efforts of resistance as well as good military organization at Essling and all around the sphere of strategic dominance.\n\nDeception and glory\n\nIn reading Marbot’s lucid account, Napoleon’s ambivalent generalship had reached a downturn. At Essling, he faced untold hardships, and was in a difficult position to confront the Austrian army corps under the inspired leadership of Erzherzog Karl von Österreich (i.e. Archduke Charles of Austria)[3] who tried to make a grand effort – a masterful maneuvering that rivalled his opponent – for the preservation of Vienna, the capital city of the Habsburgs monarchy.\n\nAlthough the Emperor’s sharpness and strategic ductility were not at theirs zenith, just a few years earlier (War of the Third Coalition; invasion of 1805), his martial abilities remained still impressive. Napoleon’s fluent over-confidence in his innate qualities and appealing magnetic zeal, convenient to the point of propaganda, could persuade a retreating[4] infantry regiment to change the perception (defeat, turning to stalemate) the soldiers had had on the line of collision: no difficulties were opposed by the Austrians, sufficient to search for the Colonel, and it did not matter if he was reported for tombé en bataille (i.e. perished in battle).[5]\n\nThe seasoned veteran officer had bravely served in the ranks of the regiment wherever he had been ordered, and through long years of service à l’ armée (i.e. army service). Napoleon did not point out the crucial moment and the lasting intricacies of the battle, but contained himself to question the troops on the sacred fulcrum of military life: the devotion to the arms. Where is your Colonel? (author: quite a “synonymic” expression for “banner”) A straight, imposing question. One would be prone to understand this question in the following way: what have you done with that “banner” in the past? The meaning was quite subtle, giving plenty of reflection, significance, and remembrances to the victorious campaigns experienced in the past – and pending on the foretelling that those military successes shall have continued during the 1809 challenge and ongoing offensive push.\n\nNapoleon’s deception to the troops was a mastery of blundering, a formidable cunning. His questioning words did not appeal to the factual concept of gloire (i.e. glory), but tried to revive the concept the soldiers had of valour, a strictly related association of ideas connected to the figure and to the determined personality of their Colonel. This is the congenial reason why the French emperor appealed (directly; author: and by “comparison”) to the “regiment’s standard”, thus “imbuing” the valiant officier who had lead them, setting a standard to duty to front-line leadership. The emphasis of this scene was more convincing in which way Napoleon was able to control unexpected rapidly changing events on the battlefield. Meanwhile the French generalissimo had sought to lay the groundwork for the battle’s climatic attack, and this perseverance reanimated the hardihood of the troops.\n\nThe regiment followed, with a shout of “Long live the Emperor!” exterminated some hundred Austrians, remained master of the position, and got back the body of its colonel, which a grenadier company brought and laid down at the Emperor’ s feet.\n\nAs you quite understand, the Emperor cared nothing having the poor officer’ s body, but he wished to attain the double object of retaking the village, and impressing upon the troops that the colonel is a second flag, which a good regiment should never abandon.\n\nThis conviction in moments of difficulty exalts the courage of the men and leads them to fight obstinately around their chief, dead or living.\n\nThe Austrian painter and illustrator Felician Myrbach, Freiherr von Rheinfeld (Zaleščiki, Ukraine, February 19, 1853-Klagenfurt, January 14, 1940) left a vividly illustrated aquarelle\n\n(Fighting in the streets of Essling) centered on the strenuous disputation of the battle ground.\n\nComment: The effectual counter-attack ordered to the French (this tactical option allowed them to quickly concentrate their troops, as this operation implied having received more reinforcements) gained – through flexibility and manoeuvrability – the momentum. Engaged in a vigorous offensive push against positioned forces on ground, the fiercely advancing infantry companies unleashed all their fury to take possession once more of the country village. They then lured the Austro-Hungarian battle units out of Essling, inflicting heavy casualties upon them. After a dreadful massacre, exceedingly bloody (the extermination reached into the hundreds), the corpse of the probe officer who had braved all dangers opposed to his advance, was brought back amid the distressful lamentations of his companions in arms.\n\nThe camaraderie (i.e. comradeship) and escort guard of the Grenadiers provided a solemn and mournful cortège of combatants. Despite the pugnacious and literary ambitious scene of combat worth recalling the honneur des armes (i.e. honour of the arms) – certainly a memento Marbot wrote to posterity –, a couple of questions would have to be posed: a) was there any difference in death between a Colonel and a common soldier? b) How many unnamed lives were sacrificed to have one corpse back a few hundred yards? No cultivated replies are searched for. Carefully reading (on Essling) through this passage, we are basically told some fairly “unexpressed” ideas about the lethality of warfare and the cost these tremendous clashings had in human losses.\n\nExcerpts taken from Marbot’s memories are clear to the point – of intelligibility, and imposed Napoleonic megalomania. Essentially written, the narrative confirms the evidence on Napoleon’s direct responsibilities on the killing of soldiers used as chair à canon (i.e. cannon-fodder), and, last but not least, about the unreported sufferings the soldats (i.e. soldiers) endured from their wounds. Paradoxically, this reversal of understanding in the primary historical source also accounted how, under Napoleon’s ceaseless practice of warfare, the aventure médicale et chirurgicale (i.e. medical and surgical adventure) of the period was nonetheless in constant evolvement thanks to the solicitous carings of the empereur, a supposedly “brilliant and competent strategist”.\n\nFrench casualties in battle proved highly sensible and detrimental to the Army functional structure as well: Marshal Lannes[6] was killed, and both général de division (i.e. division general) Espagne[7] and général de brigade (i.e. brigade general) Pouzet[8] suffered his fate. Among the general officers seriously wounded: Claparède,[9] Destabenrath,[10] Durosnel,[11] Franquemont, Gros,[12] La Grange,[13] Legrand,[14] Mouton,[15] Navelet,[16] Saint-Hilaire,[17] and Tharreau.[18]\n\nThen, turning to Prince Berthier, the Emperor reminded him of the discussion in the council, adding, “If when I asked for the colonel there had been a lieutenant-colonel instead of the major, they would have said, “Here he is”, and the effect which I wished to produce would have been less impressive, for in the soldiers eyes lieutenant-colonel and colonel are pretty nearly synonymous titles”.\n\nThen the Emperor sent word to the major, who had just taken his regiment along so bravely, that he promoted him to colonel [cfr. Marbot, 1935, pp. 223-224].\n\nComment: Despite the futility of the above cited statement, Napoleon’s prevailing statement sounded as if he did not perceive in terms of human sufferance (infantrymen were struck down indiscriminately by sustained Austrian fire-volleys and in the pêle-mêle rush of events) the blundering effect he had instead caused on the disputed terrain at Essling.\n\nHis one-directional concern appeared to debunk a major deficiency to the worry, respect, and consequences that would have to be paid by the families of the fallen soldiers, to the women left widows, and to the preadolescents deprived of their fathers. Napoleon’s utter insensibility was remarkable to the point of his unweighted sottise (i.e. silly remark) and caprice caractériel (i.e. characterial whim).\n\nThe promotion of the surviving Major to the hierarchy-rank of Colonel was in corresponding function to a subservient military servitude – and supposedly re-affirmed grandeur (i.e. greatness), to increase the honour of an infantry unit that had lost heavily under mowing enemy assaults.\n\nAnalytical remark\n\nMap of Aspern - Essling\n\nThe whole literary exposé and versatile story-telling, approaching to the finely rendered tonalities of a tableau militaire (i.e. military narration), equally captured the scenery which vividly illustrated what a battlefield was like in the age of Napoleon, and the impressions of brutality, heroism, and carnage they stood for. However, the author’s perspective is quite defined, and no doubts are left.\n\nThat is the reason why any serious Napoleonic military buff, modern researcher, and scholar who has an interest in this era, must be careful to discern on this eyewitness narrative and its anobli (i.e. ennobled) storylines. One more question does rise: by capturing the insights of this histoire événémentiel (i.e. events-based history), did the author cast an eye on a critical time in Napoleon’s saga? Through the significantly produced literary evidence – I suppose – the reply is quite affirmative; but the methodological approach here is unique, in style accomplishment – that is to say in its intrinsic psychological nature.\n\nMarbot singled a particular frame, and detailed a human behaviour out of a variety of military circumstances and unflinching attitudes he had all around. Undeniably this mémoire d’ épopée (i.e. memory of the epoch) may be considered as a per se indication of the way the skilful aid-de-camp surveyed the emperor’s generalship, establishing the relevancy of the individual by his pernicious defaults. Discerning through not seemingly marginal episodes that bring history to life, the intent of the author was arguably to show the participants as much human as much fallible beings, with défaillances (i.e. faults) like all common men have, and not as half-gods of warfare. Marbot’s penetrating view of the battle (Napoleon versus soldiers, French soldiers versus Napoleon) marked that specific, and shed light on the reasons for the reverse suffered at Essling.\n\nPost Scriptum\n\nCould we comment that continued attrition on the battlefield (seemingly leading to a fiery disputed strategic supremacy, and though not achieved by a victorious outcome) was a Pyrrhic victory, due to the overwhelming casualties suffered by the French, especially in commanding officers? Could that be the reason of Napoleon’s failure? Or that his stubbornness in sending more troops to their death was strategic folly? It rather reminds me of the battle at Montecassino (Italy, 1944), where the Allied command kept trying to storm the German Grüne-Teufel-held citadel. Finally, the Allies just had the Air Force bomb it, causing unnecessary deaths and destruction. I feel a spontaneous inclination to compare modern battles (XXth Century) by analogy, to others historical events in the past.\n\nHowever, casualty ratios among the belligerents – Charles (99,000 Austrians, 264 guns), Napoleon (66,000, 150 guns) – were frightful. Victor lost 21,500 in killed and wounded, plus 1,500 prisoners of war. Charles lost 23,000 killed and wounded, plus 2,000 prisoners. [vide: Gunther E. Rothenberg, The Art of Warfare in the Age of Napoleon, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1980, Appendix I, p. 251]. On further examination of the data: the victor losses were 23.23 % of combatants; the defeated suffered 37.87 %.\n\nChronology\n\n5 January: Treaty of the Dardanelles (aka Dardanelles Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Secret Alliance; otherwise mentioned as Treaty of Çanak, or Treaty of Chanak) concluded between Britain and the Ottoman Empire.

Its capricious fate was the first serious setback Napoleon suffered over a decade.\n\n[2] This information was sorted out by Napoleon himself, who had reached on the line of martial honour.\n\n[3] Karl Ludwig Johann Josef Laurentius was born on September 5, 1771 in Florence – and died in 1847 (Vienna, April 30). The son of Emperor Leopold II, and his consort the Infanta Maria Louisa of Spain. The brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, he ascended the military hierarchy up to the rank of Austrian Field-Marshal.\n\n[4] Attention must be paid to this verbal form, and to the argument it evidences. The verb masked the true sequence of events. A pregnant point was here well focussed: to consider that the dismayed officiers (i.e. officers) had lost command and tactical control of their fighting units; therefore, order in the ranks had to be re-establish at all costs before the Austrian tidal wave could be irrepressible turning to a débâcle (i.e. collapse, disaster).\n\n[5] Although explicit information had been reported – the passing of a valorous regiment-level commander –, this date could not be confirmed for certain, especially since it occurred in an area still disputed by the opposing Imperial troops. It is equally deduced that many witnesses had seen the officer fall, and unmoving (his motionless body and static posture indicated that he had fallen in a dead faint). Perhaps hope was harboured at the last gasp that the Colonel could be extricated and saved by his fellow companions in arms.\n\nIt very doubtful that a single infantry regiment under full battle conditions and badly overwhelmed (the units had in fact recoiled backward) could be – as stated by Marbot – «[…] resolved to avenge him and retake Essling, […]» –, and effect revanche (i.e. revenge) for the Colonel’s death.\n\nThe couverture littéraire (i.e. literary covering) and apologetic tone given by Marbot to the real sequence of military actions is, in this case, quite noteworthy, a spurious mystification; a compassionate act and unrestrained moral grief, to pass unmentioned the vulnerability (aka mith of invicibility) and the beating of the French arms.\n\nThis is really the point of the matter, and the difference it made: the exhausted French were not winning on the battlefield, and Marbot was seeing this pitiful state of things with his own eyes – as was Napoleon, too.\n\nThe contradiction is fairly obvious by the fact that the French, in no hope of success, had left their positions at Essling uncovered because they were hammered by the enemy Ermattungsstrategie (i.e. a wearing-out strategy). The French regiment, having sustained heavy losses, was inferior in number to confront and balance the troops of the Danubian monarchy; and with inequality of force would have been doomed to ultimate failure, and annihilated to the last man within a time.\n\nHowever, Marbot was convinced that the regiment retrograde movement some distance away was caused by the resolve «[…] to avenge him – the fallen commanding-officer – and retake Essling, […]»; consequentially, having misinterpreted (and conveniently removed) the unvarnished reality which passed before his eyes, he did not hesitate to write down his pensée (i.e. thinking, personal view) on the matière des armes (i.e. military affair).\n\nAlthough the exposed narrative contaminates and contradicts the genuine understanding of the original historical source, nonetheless it is easy to discern the reason why it had been styled by a filtered character of preferability.\n\nIn this instance, an old Latin axiom can well teach the importance of critical analysis and discerning on the historical source; it recited: Non numerantur, sed ponderantur – trsl.: They – author: eyewitnesses – are not counted, but weighed.\n\n[6] Jean Lannes was born at Lectoure (Gers), on April 10, 1769. And died after his wounds at Ebersdorf (May 30, 1809).\n\n[7] Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne was born at Auch (Gers), on February 16, 1769. Charging at Essling, he was mortally wounded by a boulet. He expired in the Lobau island (May 21, 1809).\n\n[8] Pierre-Charles Pouzet was born at Poitiers, on July 11, 1776. On May 22, at the battle of Aspern-Essling Pouzet and Maréchal Lannes were discussing strategic options when a cannonball flew straight into Pouzet, killing him instantly. «While the two armies were mutually watching each other but not moving, and the commanders in groups in rear of the battalions were discussing the events of the day, Marshal Lannes, weary with riding, had dismounted, and was walking about with Major-General Pouzet. Just then a spent ball struck the general on the head laying him dead at the marshal’ s feet. […]. His grief, then, at seeing him fall dead was very great» [cfr. Marbot, 1935, pp. 210-211].
