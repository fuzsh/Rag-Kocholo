One corps was designated as the advanced guard to the French army’s main body and acted as the unit which would make first contact with the enemy’s army. This corps developed the situation while other corps would attempt to maneuver to the rear of the enemy force and consequently fight a major battle under Napoleon’s control.\n\nThe advanced guard corps which made first contact, would fight an opening battle which could last many hours until reinforcements arrived. The corps under Marshal Lannes in 1806 to 1807 fought three opening battles. During each battle the corps conducted their security and reconnaissance while moving towards the enemy, seized their initial positions on the impending battlefield and fought as a combined arms organization for the duration of the opening battle.\n\nThis study shows how each of the branches; artillery, infantry, and cavalry, interacted in the opening battle. This study also reveals how Marshal Lannes established a combined arms advanced guard element within his corps each time he moved the corps as the advanced guard for the French Army. Although this advanced guard element was not a doctrinal organization for the French Army, the elements mission was strikingly similar to the larger corps acting as an advanced guard, but on a reduced scale.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to thank my wife for encouraging me during this endeavor.

His expertise in the conduct of the meeting engagement is a major catalyst for this study.\n\nCHAPTER ONE — INTRODUCTION\n\nThe French Army during the Napoleonic Wars accomplished numerous conquests that etched its combat prowess into the lore of military history. The Grand Army was the main body of Napoleon’s offensive army and was organized into combined arms corps with interacting infantry, artillery, and cavalry units. Several corps moved along separate routes through an area of operations, but within supporting distances of each other. When one corps made contact with the enemy, it was then Napoleon’s decision to give or refuse battle with other available corps. The corps commander in contact was obligated to develop the situation and decide on the best use of the available forces within his corps until reinforcements arrived, the enemy retired, or the corps withdrew. This action was known as the opening battle, fought by the advanced guard.\n\nThe primary question of this thesis is, In what manner and under what circumstances would a corps commander in Napoleon’s Army use combined arms tactics in an opening battle during the Jena and Friedland campaigns? The four secondary questions this thesis will address are: (1) What was French Army doctrine for combined arms operations in an opening battle during the Napoleonic Wars? (2) How did the corps commander use the different arms of the corps in support of each other in the opening battle? (3) What effect did terrain have on the commander’s decisions to deploy his units? (4) Did the methods of employing combined arms evolve during the two campaigns?\n\nThere are two major assumptions for this thesis. The first assumption is that analyzing the same corps commander’s actions in three separate battles will provide a useful example of combined arms combat during the Napoleonic Wars. The circumstances surrounding each of the battles are different. Some of the major variables are the relative size of enemy force, the dispositions of the forces, and the nationality of enemy. The only major constant among the three battles is Marshal Lannes and a French corps acting as the Grand Army’s advanced guard. This means that there are some consistencies in the actions and counteractions to enemy moves and countermoves.\n\nThe second assumption is that the actions taken by Lannes in the three opening battles provide a contribution to the studying of the Napoleonic practice in maneuver warfare. The corps d’ Armée was purposely structured as a large combined arms organization and by design fought in a combined arms manner. The combined arms actions of corps in the mature battles have been meticulously documented. There are major differences between the circumstances leading to the opening battle and the mature battle, consequently, there should exist a difference in the methods applied.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThere are numerous terms and phrases in this document that require definition.\n\nAdvanced Guard. The security element operating to be front of a moving force.{1}\n\nCampaign. A series of related engagements and battles designed to achieve one or more strategic objectives within a given time and space and in a theater of operations.{2}\n\nCombined Arms. The application and interaction of different arms of an army in a battle, specifically; artillery, cavalry, and infantry.{3}\n\nGrand Tactics. Commanders moving and maneuvering their forces in large bodies of troops in a number of units, an extension of elementary tactics, also referred to as the science of generals.{4}\n\nKey Terrain. Any locality or area [where] the seizure, retention, or control of which affords a marked advantage to either combatant.{5}\n\nMature Battle. The battle that develops from an opening battle, or the arrangements made prior to the mature battle, in which a large part of the main army’s forces are involved with the army commanders present.\n\nMarch Column. Military units on the march, under the control of a single commander and using the same route for movement.{6}\n\nOpening Battle. The first engagement by a part of an army in which either protagonist attempts to set the conditions of subsequent battle through military action, until reinforcements from the rest of the army arrive.\n\nOperation. A military action or the carrying out of a strategic, tactical, training, service, or administrative mission; the process of carrying on combat, including movement, supply, attack, defense, and maneuvers needed to gain the objectives of any battle or campaign.{7}\n\nStrategy. The art and science of employing the armed forces and other elements of national power during peace, conflict, and war to secure national security objectives.{8}\n\nTactics. The method by which commanders of units and higher formations bring their forces from their formations of movement into their fighting formations, and change their disposition or position once they are on the battlefield.{9}\n\nThe Mature Battle versus the Opening Battle\n\nThis study will analyze in detail the actions and decisions of one corps commander in an advanced guard opening battle. Three examples of the opening battle are compared to determine similarities and differences in the tactical employment of forces. This study emphasizes the forces at the corps commander’s disposal and how he used those forces within a combined arms framework. The enemy’s actions and counteractions, as well as terrain and weather effects, are studied to determine the influence on the corps commander’s decisions and subsequent actions in the opening battle. An analysis of the corps commander’s actions during the three"
