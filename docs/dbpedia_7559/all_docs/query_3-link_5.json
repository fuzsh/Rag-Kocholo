        "text": "One of the joys of reading history is drawing lessons for the present age. After reading Paul Johnson’s biography of Napoleon over Christmas I wondered what lessons, if any, France’s greatest ever General could teach the present age on leadership and running a large organisation.\n\nMore books have been written about Napoleon than any other military or political leader. And what a story it is! Born 1769 in Corsica, a small backwater of the French Empire. This small paunchy man, no bigger than five foot five, through sheer ambition and talent rose in a few years to become Emperor of France. Then from 1799 to 1814 he lay siege to Europe, bringing the idealism and terror of the French Revolution to all parts of the continent. He won 53 battles usually against far superior forces, humbling all the great empires of the age; Austria, Spain, Russia. By 1807 Napoleon ruled supreme across Europe. Only Sweden and distant Portugal remained outside his direct sphere of influence. After the treaty of Tilsit with the Tsar of Russia, Napoleon could pretty much order the affairs of Europe as he liked. Only England remained alone but defiant.\n\nFinally overreach in Russia and the combined might of Europe brought Napoleon under control. But not even exile on the Mediterranean island of Elba could contain Napoleon’s brilliance. In a page right out of a boys own adventure, he escaped by ship, landing in France. Through sheer bravado he persuaded the troops come to arrest him to switch sides and be his vanguard to take back Paris and the leadership.\n\nFor 100 days panic swept Europe as Napoleon reassembled his brilliant war machine, ‘the Grande Armee’ and marched out ahead of 200,000 plus men to reconquer Europe.\n\nFinally the Prussians and the Duke of Wellington ended Napoleon story at Waterloo, the greatest battle in history.\n\nWhat was it about Napoleon that made him such a decisive figure in history? What leadership traits did he possess which enabled him to conquer Europe? Are these skills and traits relatable to our age and circumstances? These were the questions I asked as I read Paul Johnson’s book.\n\nThere is no use in romanticising Napoleon. He was a liar, a cheat, a man who never honoured any treaty he signed. He held no store by human life. He once told the Austrian Foreign Minister, Metternich that he would sacrifice a million men to secure his objectives. Wellington complained that if he – Wellington - dared to lose 500 men without reason he would be brought to his knees before the House of Commons to explain. Napoleon however had no responsibility. When all was lost Napoleon abandoned two armies, one in Egypt the other in Russia, indifferent to the fate of soldiers he condemned to a slow death.\n\nMadame Stael one of Napoleon’s contemporary critics saw him as an opportunistic cold ruler. Which brings us to the first lesson from Napoleon.\n\nAll Leadership is Situational\n\nWe live in a stable market based democracy where honesty is prized and respect for human life is valued. Not so post-revolutionary France. It was a society seething with conspiracy and intrigue. Where human life was cheap and usually finished at the foot of the guillotine. A man’s word could never be trusted and the thing which mattered was who could wield power. Napoleon, head of the Grande Armée and the winner of many celebrated battles in Italy, was just the man for the situation.\n\nLeadership Success Rests on Having a Simple Strategy\n\nNapoleon’s conquest of Europe followed a simple strategy. Firstly, he attacked. Napoleon never fought a defensive battle in his career, preferring instead to set the tone of battle and select the ground he wished to fight on. Napoleon’s preferred method was to strike the weak point of his enemies. As he usually fought against a coalition of superior forces, this would often be between the two opposing armies where communication was weakest and he could encircle one enemy, crush it, then turn to the other.\n\nAll his battles followed the same successful strategy. Firstly he would open with the artillery. The ‘Gribeauval Guns used by the French army were lighter than traditional big guns meaning they could be deployed by horses close to the enemy lines ensuring maximum accuracy and carnage. They could also be pulled away and deployed swiftly to the next battle front.\n\nOnce the artillery completed its work the cavalry charged in to cut down the survivors. These cavalry were well drilled and unlike their British counterparts disciplined in their main task in clearing the ground for the next phase.\n\nNext marched in the infantry to occupy the vacant space, singing battles songs and beating drums. The noise plus the imposing frames of the old guard with their tall bearskin caps, so designed to make the wearer seem taller than they were, must have been a terrifying sight to opposing troops.\n\nOnce the three part play of artillery, cavalry and infantry was complete, Napoleon from his high ground behind the lines would survey the ground and improvise his next moves.\n\nThe simplicity of his battle plans meant his well-drilled army from Marshalls down, knew what was expected of them.\n\nUse Speed as a Strategic Weapon\n\nNapoleon was by character an impatient man. He turned this personal flaw to his strategic advantage, by being out into the field before his opponents could fully mobilise. The first to see a weakness and strike and once the battle won, moving onto the next battle before his enemy could properly form. Once that battle was won moving to the next. Check mate was occupying the opponent’s Capital. There he would await for his adversaries surrender.\n\nThis need for speed came with consequences. Over a million horse died in the Napoleonic wars. Many exhausted under the feet of his army as it rushed from battle to battle and from one side of the empire to the next\n\nAlign Your People with Your Strategy\n\nIt is not enough to have a winning strategy one must have the people to carry it out. Napoleon’s success rested on promoting men based on merit rather than a privileged name. The armies Napoleon faced still promoted officer based on the ability to purchase their rank. The Duke of Wellington, the greatest General other than Napoleon, had to buy his way into, and up the British army. It was not until 1871 that the British abolished this antiquated practice.\n\nIn the Grande Armée, brilliant men like Jean Lannes, Jean Baptise Bernadotte, Louis Suchet and Michel Ney, could rise through the ranks on merit rather than wealth.\n\nNapoleon was also generous with his Marshalls. Please Napoleon in battle, or marry into the family and you may find yourself as the ruler of Naples (Joachim Murat) or the Governor of Dresden (Gouvion St Cyr).\n\nFrancois Lefebvre’s, one of Napoleon’s great Marshall’s, explained Napoleon’s risk and reward strategy to a visitor to his house thus: ‘We will go down into my garden. I shall fire at you sixty times and if you are still alive at the end, everything I have shall be yours.’\n\nThis generosity extended down to the foot soldiers in the Grande Armée. Victory often meant a licence to loot. The Louvre owes its pre-eminence amongst world art galleries because of Napoleon’s systematic plundering of the great art collections of Europe, including the Vatican.\n\nNapoleon also initiated a plundering system which enabled simple foot soldiers to convert their booty into cash which could be sent back home to their families. Combined with the meritocracy system, a good pay; and a simple French peasant could rise through the ranks while enriching themselves and their families.\n\nIt also meant Napoleon had an army from Marshall to foot soldier committed and aligned to his object of conquest.\n\nClear and Simple Communication\n\nTo enact a simple strategy, people need clear and simple command. Napoleon was blessed as a commander with direct speech his soldiers could understand and relate to. ‘An army marches on its stomach’ and ‘a soldier will fight hard and long for a piece of ribbon’ are two of the simple axiom’s attributed to Napoleon. He also made it a point of walking amongst his troops after a battle, sharing a quiet word with the Old Guard about previous campaigns. This simple act endeared him to his troops.\n\nNapoleon was also blessed with Louis Alexandre Berthier. A Marshall gifted with brilliant organisational talent, who could implement Napoleon’s battle directions down to the minutest detail. In the chaos of battle it was his interpretation of Napoleon’s battle strategy into clear and simple directions to the other Marshalls which proved decisive in many battles.\n\nThe confusion which cost Napoleon the battle of Waterloo may have been avoided if Berthier had been by his master’s side.\n\nAttention to Detail\n\nNapoleon won many battles before they even began. He placed a great emphasis on the small details of battle. He liked to work out in advance the distance to be covered and the route to be taken by his army, often calculating the time taken down to the day and hour.\n\nNapoleon was a geographical genius who from an imperfect two dimensional map, could visualise the space through which his army must march and fight the enemy. He also liked to calculate in advance, the provisions required for his army, the likely wastage and death from disease and battle, and the ammunition needed, down to the last cannonball, for each battle.\n\nThis attention to the minute detail of his army allowed him to visualise battle scenarios, work out strategies and pre-empt problems before they arose.\n\nCulture and Mystique Are Important to a Leader\n\nThe reputation of Napoleon and the Grande Armée often preceded them. Wellington is quoted as saying Napoleon was worth 40,000 men on the battlefield.\n\nNapoleon was also one of the first to recognise the power of propaganda in maintaining his power. He used the burgeoning popular press to great effect controlling content and even providing dispatches from the front line. Napoleon also cultivated intellectuals and especially artists. Painters such as Jacques-Louis David and Paul Delaroche providing the necessary imagery for the Napoleonic regime. His conquests allowed him to furnish Paris, the centre of his power, with his stolen booty.\n\nEven with defeat he continued to think propaganda. Wellington even claiming that to divert Parisian attention from the defeats in Russia, Napoleon ordered the high kicking Parisian dancers to stop wearing underwear.\n\nA Winning Strategy Only Works If Your Competitors Play By the Rules\n\nNapoleon’s winning strategy broke down at the periphery of his empire. In Russia he marched his seemingly invincible war machine a thousand kilometres through scorched land and burning villages, fighting a reluctant opponent, happy to melt further eastwards. His half-starved army took Moscow. Yet instead of capitulating as other foes did in previous encounters, the Russian’s set fire to their Capital. A perplexed Napoleon left to watch the flames from an abandoned Kremlin and wait for a message of surrender from Tsar Alexander 1 which never came.\n\nIn Spain his army met a foe with a greater disregard for human life than he. A bitter insurgency ensuing. French stragglers caught by the Spanish rebels were often crucified on trees or plunged alive into boiling oil.\n\nWhen Circumstances Change Your Strategy Must Change Also\n\nThe Grande Armée under Napoleon was a superb fighting machine. Like any successful organisation brilliantly led, it achieved its objectives more efficiently than its competitors. However as circumstances changed, firstly with losses in Russia and resistance in Spain, the Grande Armée failed to adapt. Napoleon’s Marshalls brilliant in battle for the most part were ‘Yes Men’ reliant on Napoleon for direction. Napoleon, a great adaptor, was at centre a hard obstinate man, unable to refashion himself and change his strategy when circumstances moved against him.\n\nBureaucracy not Personality\n\nNapoleon was a man without religion, philosophy or any set ideals. The only thing he cared for was power and as he noted, this power rested: ‘on my glory and my glory on my victories.’ As a consequence Napoleon became a 'conquest' addict who didn't know when to stop.\n\nAlso like great warrior leaders before him, Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, as soon as he was exiled, first to Elba then St Helena, the entire machinery of government he built collapsed. There was no overarching philosophy or ideal which could keep it together once he was gone: only the aura of his personality. His Marshalls, brilliant in battle, were for the most part opportunists who clung to Napoleon in the good times but ready to hedge their bets when things changed.\n\nConclusion\n\nStudying Napoleon for the first time I came away with the following lessons. All leadership is situational and the leadership traits one should use depends on the environment one works in. Successful leaders develop a simple strategy and stick to it, refining it over time. Great leaders will turn a personality flaw to their advantage. Often they will have good communication skills, or have people around them who will ensure that their message is sent out across the organisation. Symbolism and propaganda are very important.\n\nSuccessful leaders use rewards to align their people with the overall objectives. They also watch small detail closely. Good leaders should scan their environment for changing circumstances and build a learning environment within their organisation to ensure when change occurs, their organisations change with it.\n\nHowever, what Napoleon taught me mostly, is that all leader in the end are judged by their actions. Napoleon brought death and destruction to much of Europe.He destroyed France as a super power. Every waking moment, Napoleon lusted after power and glory and became the prototype to modern tyrants such as Hitler and Stalin.\n\nIn the end we should heed the warning Leo Strauss on leadership: ‘never to mistake mediocrity, however brilliant, for true greatness.’"
