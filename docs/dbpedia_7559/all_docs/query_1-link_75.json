        "text": "Court service adjustment of a captain of the chief of archers of Guard of Francis 1st, Emperor of Austria\n\nAustrio hungarian uniforms could also be gorgeous.\n\nThis is a sample of what could be worn by dignitaries, quite impressive!\n\nThe Arcièren Life Guards were founded in 1763 by Empress Maria Theresa as a mounted life guard.\n\nShe was considered the foremost of the imperial bodyguards. Its members were senior, deserving officers, and its captain was always a general.\n\nDuring court service he wore this tunic made of red cloth, which is richly embroidered with gold on the entire front, on the lapels, the lower sleeves and the center back.\n\nThis included epaulettes made of gold bouillon, a sash with long golden tassels, a silver helmet with a white buffalo hair tuft, a sabre, white boot trousers and knee-high black patent leather boots. (MKR)\n\nPrice with epaulettes.\n\nCopied form a uniform kept in Habsburg museum in Vienna\n\nHabit of \" Maître de la garde robe Impériale\" of comte Henri Amédée Mercure de Turenne-d'Ayrac\n\nFrom a painting by Jacques-Louis David.\n\nWe supplied wardrobe of Napoleon (for re enactment) years long.\n\nWe thought that it was interesting to be dressed as the man who did the job 2 centuries ago!\n\nMurat hat from painting of Gros, Louvre museum\n\nLouvre museum asked us to make different copies of parts of uniforms of famous paintings.\n\nWe could not use aigrette feathers as they are now forbidden, other parts are similar with painting.\n\nYou can also see shoes and gloves of Napoléon on painting of coronation by David.\n\nIndicated price is for hat only.\n\nBicorn of general officer or field marshall without feathers\n\nFor purpose of comfort and economy, generals would wear hats without feathers or without embroideries and sometimes neither of them.\n\nThe cockade can be maintained with a oak leaves' braid (worn by Lassale at Stettin, see detail of painting) or torsades (Les invalides museum).\n\nNo issues with the colour of the feather which usually helps to identify the grade \"général de brigade\" or \"division\"\n\nIf you're going to be promoted.... no need to change your feathers!\n\nPainting with different hats made during Empire, shows you how different could be officer's hats\n\nField marshal or generals bicorns, bordered with ostrich feathers\n\nSumptuous hat worn by the highest rank of officers.\n\nBordered by a very special braid, topped by white ostrich feathers for general de division commandant en chef or marshall, and black for general de brigade or general de division.\n\nCockade is maintained by a braid or metallic bullions fixed by a golden button of field marshal or general.\n\nBlack feathers cannot be assorted with marshall buttons.\n\nAdmiral bicorn end XIX th century\n\nWe made it to replace one who belonged to the ancestor of our customer.\n\nWe made it from an old base to look like an old one. Braid, torsades and feathers are new.\n\nNext one will be made only with new stuff.\n\nUniform of Bonaparte for Marengo and Egypt. Price for jacket and waistcoat only\n\nCopy of the the Jacket kept in the \"Musée des Invalides\". We made a copy for Musée Grévin in Paris.\n\nJacket and waistcoat of Général de division, 7 august 1798 regulation type. This is the uniform of Bonaparte for the battle of Marengo and also when he crossed the \"Col du Grand Saint Bernard\", painted by David\n\n\"habit de grand uniforme\" for general de brigade, empire\n\nVery rich jacket used by a \"general de brigade\".\n\nCollar and sleaves extremities have one rank of oak leaves instead of 2 for a general de division.\n\nIndicated price is for jacket only without epaulettes and aiguillettes.\n\n\"Petite tenue de marechal d'empire\" jacket\n\nNot the most impressive type, but however shiny!\n\nWhen in campaigns, marshalls did not appreciate to wear fragile and uncomfortable cloths, that were also excellent targets for \"snippers\".\n\nSo, they used to wear simplified uniforms.\n\nGrande tenue de general de division\n\nGold embroideries 6 cm large, instead of 8 for field marshalls.\n\n2 ranks of embroideries under pockets , on collar and cuffs, instead of one for \"general de brigade\"\n\nPrice is for jacket only, without epaulettes, decorations and any other accessories.\n\nGénéral de brigade, Grand Uniforme regulation type 1er vendémiaire An XII\n\nCopy, but as général de brigade (one rank of oak leaves on collar, cuffs and around pockets), of uniform of général Dupas, in musée de l'Empéri.\n\nTill 1804 collar and cuffs for generals are red. Then they have same colour as all uniform.\n\n\"petite tenue de general de divison\" jacket\n\nNot the most impressive type, but however shiny!\n\nWhen in campaigns, marshalls did not appreciate to wear fragile and uncomfortable cloths, that were also excellent targets for \"snippers\".\n\nSo, they used to wear simplified uniforms.\n\n\"Petite tenue de general de divison\" jacket. Embroideries inside sides of back.\n\nNot the most impressive type, but however shiny!\n\nWhen in campaigns, marshalls did not appreciate to wear fragile and uncomfortable cloths, that were also excellent targets for \"snippers\".\n\nSo, they used to wear simplified uniforms.\n\nWaistcoat for general, with or without collar\n\nRegulation type embroideries for generals are normally 35 mm large...but very often generals did what they wanted.\n\nThis one respects regulation.\n\nYou can order it with or without collar.\n\nWithout collar you don't have to come in our atelier to adjust it on you..\n\nOne 112 cm on stock\n\nBelt of Dorsenne uniform - For waist size max 100 cm. Gold or silver Embroideries\n\nCopied from musée de l'Empéri in gold embroideries.\n\nEmbroideries are same, buckles are different.\n\nWe also made one with silver embroideries, that will fit with an italian general uniform or colonel général des carabiniers...Etc.\n\nOne of each on stock for waist size max 100 cm , measured at level on navel, on uniform (not bare!).\n\nShako of prince Borghese\n\nWe copied this shako, too beautiful to exist only in one collection.\n\nIt is a gift of Borghese family to Napoleonic Museum of Roma.\n\nWw made it in size 56 to keep proportions of period, we can make it bigger, just be patient.\n\nPolish style uniform of prince Murat during Iena, from Horace Vernet\n\nMurat had the most amazing uniforms of Napoleonic Period.\n\nOnce again this uniform is quite an unusual type. We bordered it with mink from an old coat, not so easy to find.\n\nIf we have to make this uniform again, price and time to make it will depend of possible supply of appropriate fur.\n\nOrder from a well known re enactor, who organizes Waterloo re enactments...and others.\n\nMurat \"uniform\" in Tilsitt.\n\nMade from painting of Jean Charles Tardieu (1765-1830):\" Napoléon reçoit la reine de Prussse à Tilsitt\" (museum of Versailles).\n\nQuite an unusual uniform as Murat used to wear. Dolman cannot be closed, pelisse is replaced by a small cloak, belt is closed by a massive double buckle.\n\nOur customer gave embroideries to do to a French embroider (except for sabretache), because we had really few time to make them.\n\nAll other parts are made in our atelier. Price (embroideries included) near 10 000 € for waistcoat, jackets, trousers, belt and sabretache.\n\nCostume of prince Murat during Smolensk battle\n\nEccentric costume like Murat used to wear.\n\nOriginally made of silk, we used melton to allow a long use.\n\nThe price includes: jacket, scarf, hat, trousers.\n\nWe don't plan to do this uniform twice...it is just another sample of what we can do.\n\n\"Grande tenue \" of marshall Davout\n\nMaître Thierry de Maigret, auctioneer, sold on 18th November 2009 a genuine uniform of field Marshall which belonged to maréchal Davout. Price was near 300 000 €. Mr Bernard Croissy, expert, allowed us to take many pictures and we could realise this nice copy. We usually make this jacket in melton, we can also make it in velvet, price can be different according to type of velvet.\n\nMarshalls could also wear uniforms from their special corp, as the next one: Colonel General des Grenadiers\n\nUniform: Grande tenue de payeur général de la garde, price for jacket only, without aiglets and waistcoat.\n\nWhat seduced us in the first place with the paymaster of the guard outfit, is its highly unusual aspect.\n\nThe Oak leaves' embroidery mixes gold and silver, and the background of the outfit is said to be purple by A. Jouineau, one of the most respectable author.\n\nHe based himself on a source describing this model seen by a writer of the last century ...\n\nFrom these informations, a drawing of a purple outfit, embroidered with an alternation of silver and gold oak leaves was suggested\n\nWe created a first campaign jacket, echoing the embroidery proposed by A. Jouineau, who seemed a bit dull compared to the rank of paymaster of the guard a general rank...\n\nColonel général des chasseurs à cheval\n\nPrice without epaulettes and aiguillettes.\n\nGrouchy habit veste of colonel des chasseurs à cheval. Grouchy was considered as partly responsible of Waterloo defeat, but he only respected orders of Napoléon and usually won all his battles, including the last victory of French army in Wavre.\n\nAnother uniform existed in hussar style, described in \"Grand livre du sacre\"\n\nJunior officer of carabinier, Ferdinand de Lariboisière, First Empire,\n\nFrom painting of Antoine Jean Gros: \"Le général de Lariboisière (1759-1812) faisant ses adieux à son fils, lieutenant au 1er régiment de carabiniers, au début de la bataille de La Moskowa, le 7 septembre 1812\" .\n\nEverything have been produced in our atelier, except sabre (not regulation type) and helmet, we do one now, more historical..\n\nIndicated price includes:\n\nJacket with silver grenades on turnbacks: 970 €.\n\nEpaulettes as in musée de l'Empéri: 360 €.\n\nShort trousers looking like leather: 210 €\n\nCollar peace/war: 23 €\n\nShirt: 35 €\n\nBelt with sabre bearer: 185 €\n\nHelmet: 970 €\n\n\"Petite tenue de general de divison\" jacket for cavalry\n\nNot the most impressive type, but however shiny!\n\nWhen in campaigns, marshalls did not appreciate to wear fragile and uncomfortable cloths, that were also excellent targets for \"snippers\".\n\nSo, they used to wear simplified uniforms.\n\nIndicated price is for jacket only without epaulettes and decorations.\n\nUniform of général de division, cuirassier.\n\nMade from different pieces of our old stock.\n\nCuirasse is a second hand one used on many battlefields, we cleaned it, but it is not perfect.\n\nSmall difference of nuance (not evident) in gold embroideries between collar and cuffs.\n\nSmall fault (not evident) on silverplating of helmet between crest and fur under cr\n\nUniform of Dorsenne\n\nDorsenne was a dandy, who passed hours everyday to curl his hair and adjust his especially well cut uniforms.\n\nDuring Essling battle in 1809, 3 horses were killed under him and he was deeply wounded.\n\nIn june 1812, he leaded Imperial guard in Spain. He was still so affected by this precedent event that he had to suffer an undergone trepanation...he died some days later.\n\nMinister cloak\n\nMade exactly as Picot embroiderer made them 2 centuries ago, we have the original book of \"Maison Picot\" who made most of more precious embroideries during empire period.\n\nIndicated price is for cloak only.\n\nEmbroidered cloak with oak leaves\n\nCan be done in dark marine(as described in\"planches Rousselot\") or light blue melton for général Castella ( as described in planches Rigo).\n\nDelivery time: 2 to 3 months.\n\nWaistcoat for light cavalry officer\n\nAmazing waistcoat with 90 buttons on gold or silver froggings, sewed on a shiny cloth. A wonderfull sample of empire richness! We can add small thread on collar, around pockets and on the front. 3 or 5 buttons per rank of frog.\n\nBack is usually tightened by one string.\n\nLafayette nous voici\n\nNot so easy to choose inside numerous paintings of Lafayette, sometimes very different.\n\nThe period was so troubled that regulation type uniforms were probably really made in few samples.\n\nWe finally make the choice showed on this picture, described in many paintings.\n\nLieutenant général au règlement de 1791 uniform of marquis de Lafayette\n\nWe even reproduced a very particular brass plate!\n\nBonaparte had the same uniform when he was promoted as general after Toulon victory.\n\nIndicted price includes jacket( 2800 €), waistcoat(201 €), long trousers in cotton(149 €), belt with his nice buckle(780 €), tricorn without plume (370€).\n\nGénéral Lasalle at Stettin battle belt\n\nCopy of belt used by general Lasalle on painting conserved in Invalides museum.\n\nFits also for light cavalry officers...even in red, or with silver braids and buckles for some hussar and also for line cavalry chasseurs.\n\nFournier Sarloveze, trousers\n\nThis is the result of some hours of work in our atelier...\n\nFits, in red, with the assorted dolman.\n\nCan be done in other colours."
