        "text": "I generally quite like Zamoyski’s approach to Napoleon. I’m very much in the camp of treating Napoleon as “just a man” in the sense that he was a human responding to the world he lived in with the information he had at hand.\n\nWith regards to historical practice, I think it is best to approach all people as just that - people. You will get a more honest reading of your sources that way. Obviously with someone like Napoleon it’s harder to go into the source material devoid of the cultural response to him that you were raised with. Whether it be genius or villain. But I think it’s important to try.\n\nWould I call Napoleon a genius?\n\nI also struggle to ascribe the very untetherable concept of “genius” to anyone. I know I use it in day to day life (e.g. “Umberto Eco was a fucking genius excuse me while I try to become him but with more magic”) but when it comes to serious historical (and present day) analysis of people no. I don’t like using that term. Or any grand sweeping terms, in general.\n\nI dislike using the term genius not only because its lack of clear definition but also because I believe that using grant terms such as “genius” or “villain” robs people not only of their individuality but also their agency. On top of that, it also serves to reduce the importance of the people around them and the circumstances in which they found themselves. The idea of a genius singlehandedly conquering the known world is a very romanticized narrative that is not an accurate reflection of history. No one is alone when they’re achieving things - whatever those things might be. Authors aren’t alone; the first mountaineer on top of the summit wasn’t alone; generals aren’t alone; musicians aren’t alone; politicians aren’t alone; researchers aren’t alone and so on and so forth.\n\nNapoleon was a man with some exceptional qualities who was at the right time, right place and had the right personality and support of the right people. That perfect concoction is what allowed him to be propelled into empire. He couldn’t have done it without support from his brothers, his generals, Josephine, and statesmen like Talleyrand and Cambacérès. All of these individuals were as integral to Napoleon’s success as Napoleon himself.\n\nI don’t see this as making Napoleon any less worthy or interesting as a figure to study, but rather returns to him his humanity by removing the god-like status (or absolute evil villain status) he has a habit of acquiring. It also presents a more realistic narrative and understanding of the events that allowed for the rise and fall of the first Empire.\n\nThank you so much for the ask! I want to say that I absolutely adore your art. You are hands down one of my favourite artists.\n\n<3\n\n@rivaldii\n\nthanks for your response I always love hearing what you have to say abt Napoleon! I’ve generally always seen him described as either despotic egomaniac or brilliant leader, which is why this author’s (ive only read the intro so far) insistence that he was not as great as all that was sort of surprising, it brought him down to earth in a way.but then, im speaking as someone who started to get know him through josephine’s biographers\n\n–\n\nAnytime! I love rambling about that dumb nerd.\n\nI personally don’t go as far as Zamoyski as I think Napoleon had some exceptional qualities to him. But I really appreciate Z’s approach and his work to humanize Napoleon. It makes for a more honest interpretation, in my view.\n\nHistorians have often struggled to get into Napoleon’s head or to understand certain things about him and I think a lot of that struggle comes from the fact that they viewed him as an archetype rather than a human. As soon as you strip that veneer away, a veneer Napoleon himself worked hard to construct as well as those who survived him, he becomes much easier to understand.\n\nMale historians especially seem to have an issue with reading Napoleon with any sort of detachment and I think it’s because they sort of position themselves as Napoleon or Wellington, depending. So you get this stupidly fraught narrative. It’s also why they generally treat Josephine and Marie-Louise so poorly. (and it’s also why they’re super obsessed with Napoleon’s dick but that psychological reading of bad historians is for another time.)\n\nI do think it is kind of funny how Napoleon historians trash Josephine and Josephine historians trash Napoleon (speaking in very broad strokes here). It surely can’t be that hard to recognize the humanity of these two people. They both had good points, they both had big faults, and their relationship was deeply complicated. It’s not that hard. /shrug\n\nAnnnnyway I’ll stop rambling now. :D\n\n“a veneer Napoleon himself worked hard to construct”, a lot of what came out of St Helena really feels like that; like in revisiting his past he was also trying to revise it. It’s hard to tell if some the things he (reportedly) said to Las Cases (or even Bertrand) reflect his honest thoughts, he contradicts himself quite a bit.\n\ntreatment of the women around Napoleon by his biographers is 80% of the reason I’ve trouble getting through biographies on his life. I have yet to find a Napoleon bio that doesn’t view Josephine and ML through this incredibly narrow frame of “the women who cheated on Napoleon”. They are so often written as featherbrained, inconsequential, pestering, and inconstant which almost makes the reader wonder why he ever put up with them. But, he procrastinated on getting that divorce in 1809 for so many years for a reason, almost as if Josephine had more going on than being a bothersome child-less non-entity…\n\ntrying to make the one sound better by besmearing the other is such a common trope in both kinds of bios, and it’s unfortunate because their relationship is so complex, toxic yes (which worked for them in a weird way), and yet it wasn’t rancorous. Even with the Captn. Charles fiasco. What that did is knock Josephine off the unrealistic pedestal he had placed her on (which gave him leave to take mistresses without feeling too guilty), but it’s not something he actively used against her, even though he could have (whether or not she actually had the affair is a whole other discussion. I think there is reasonable doubt there). Yet every biographer brings the problems in their marriage back to her “numerous affairs” (I don’t know why that’s always used in the plural either??) as if both of them didn’t admit that the biggest problems between them were her debts (and she would lie to him to try to cover them up) and his affairs, and yes, ultimately, their childlessness. And somehow I suspect that had Josephine been able to conceive a male heir, and they had stayed married, there would be nowhere near as much ink spilled in trying to paint her as the woman that “ruined” Napoleon and “never loved him”.\n\npls I live for Napoleonic rambling :)\n\n(that got so long tho oops)"
