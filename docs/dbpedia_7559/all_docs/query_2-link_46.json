A Rare letter of historical content, L.S., `Lannes´, two pages, 4to, Tudela, 25th November 1808, to his wife Louise Guéhenneuc, in French. Lannes is exultant and lengthy reports on his victory at the Battle of Tudela in Spain two days earlier, stating in part `I had written to you from Burgos that I intended to remain close to the Emperor, but I received the order on that same day to take the command of the army corps under Marshal Moncey and the division under General Lagrange. I marched to Logrono in order to attack the enemy who was here, fifty thousand men commanded by Catagnos. He was in a dreadful position, and has been tumbled from all flancs by six thousand men. Judge the valor of that scoundrel. I hope all will be under control before four days. We have chased them everywhere. He has not a single cannon now, we have taken all his artillery and made till now six thousand prisoners. There you have his formidable armies fully destroyed.´,  Lannes further refers to his wife´s brother who is his aide-de-camp, stating `Louis had a horse killed under him and got his teeth hit, nothing important.. I am a bit tired, and intend to leave in two days to return alongside His Majesty. General Lagrange had his arm shot through, he is here with me, but nothing broken, it will be fine in a month time. Please tell Madame Lagrange to be calm, she will meet her husband in a month, he is departing to France. And you too, be secure, we will not have troubles, there is no more enemy, no army.´, and Lannes concludes with an unusual remark saying `The Battle of Tudela is the finest one we have ever had´.
