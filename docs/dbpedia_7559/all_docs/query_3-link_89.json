Napoleon, however, changed all of this and in a few short years transformed the French army into the most powerful force on the continent of Europe. During the period of 1805 to 1813, Napoleon’s army had no equal with regard to operational effectiveness. Speed and positioning of forces were the two main characteristics that made the French army so successful. These same two characteristics were also inherent to French cavalry units. Thus, the central research question is: What influence did cavalry have upon Napoleon’s operations? To facilitate this study, two campaigns were examined that illustrate cavalry’s impact on Napoleon’s operations. The first campaign was the Jena Campaign of 1806; the second was the Saxony Campaign of 1813. The Jena Campaign demonstrated that with the employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry, Napoleon could render his victories decisive through the complete destruction of the enemy army. Conversely, the Saxony Campaign demonstrated that without the effective employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry, Napoleon could not obtain the complete destruction of the enemy army and thus, his victories were hollow, or at best Pyrrhic. Therefore, based on the analysis of these two campaigns, this study has concluded that Napoleon’s cavalry was a key element for Napoleon achieving complete destruction of the enemy army, thus rendering his victories decisive.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI enjoyed the support and assistance of several people while writing this thesis. In particular I would like to thank Major Steven J. Rauch and Dr. Thomas Huber, from the Combat Studies Institute, who proved instrumental in drafting the initial construct for the analysis of this study, and whose words of encouragement never faltered. I would also like to thank LTC John Cantlon, from the Department of Tactics, for his assistance with collecting information on the Interim Brigade Combat Team and his guidance on how to maintain relevance to the modern Army. I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the help and assistance I received from the research librarians at the Combined Arms Research Library, in particular, Mr. Mike Browne, who proved instrumental in getting the entire project started. Most of all, thanks to my wife Kim, whose sacrifice was tremendous and greatly appreciated during this best year of our life.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nBFV—Bradley fighting vehicle\n\nCSS—combat service support\n\nFM—field manual\n\nFCS—future combat system\n\nHIC—high intensity conflict\n\nHMMWV—high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle\n\nIBCT—interim brigade combat team\n\nLAV—light armored vehicle\n\nLIC—low intensity conflict\n\nLOC—lines of communications\n\nMOOTW—military operations other than war\n\nMRC—major regional conflict\n\nNBC—nuclear, biological, and chemical\n\nRSTA—reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition\n\nTTP—techniques, tactics, and procedures\n\nUAV—unmanned aerial vehicle\n\nUS—United States\n\nCHAPTER 1 — INTRODUCTION\n\nNapoleon’s rise to power in the late eighteenth century occurred at a time when the structure of most European armies was based on the paradigm army of Frederick the Great. Napoleon, however, changed all of this and in a few short years transformed the French army into the most powerful force on the continent of Europe. During the period of 1805 to 1813, the French army had no equal with regard to operational effectiveness. The two main characteristics of his army were speed and positioning of forces—two traits that are inherent to cavalry units. These two traits have recently gained renewed interest of the United States Army as it goes through a process of transformation to maintain strategic relevance during a period of redefinition of national strategy.\n\nSince the end of the Vietnam War, the forces of the US Army have predominantly focused on the extreme ends of the spectrum for military operations—light infantry units for low intensity conflicts (LICs) and military operations other than war (MOOTW), and heavy mechanized and armored forces for high intensity conflict (HIC), and major regional conflicts (MRCs). For today’s emerging strategy, the heavy forces have been determined to be too heavy for rapid deploy ability; and the light forces, while rapidly deployable, are lacking in lethality and survivability. To mitigate this legacy force capability gap the Army is currently undergoing a transformation process in order to develop rapidly deployable forces that span the full spectrum of military operations. This transformation process primarily deals with exploring new doctrine and equipment. Of recent interest is the introduction of the Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) that is scheduled to be fielded with a wheeled, Lightly Armored Vehicle (LAV). Concomitantly, the Army is undergoing a review and examination of doctrine and techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) needed to properly employ this new equipment to its maximum"
