        "text": "Rules to Live By from General Colin Powell! Wise words shared by former U.S. Army Veteran and former Military Intelligence expert Annie Spiczak at our NextUp Phoenix event Extraordinary Leadership and Resilience Stories. General Colin Powell’s “rules to live by” 1. It ain’t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning. 2. Get mad, then get over it. 3. Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls your ego goes with it. 4. It can be done! 5. Be careful what you choose. You may get it. 6. Don’t let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision. 7. Check small things. 8. Share credit. 9. You can’t make someone else’s choices. You shouldn’t let someone else make yours. 10.Remain calm. Be kind. 11.Have a vision. Be demanding. 12.Don’t take counsel of your fears or naysayers. 13.Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. #nextupphoenix #extraleadership\n\nTHE LEADER TRUSTS FIRST Maj. Gen. Cameron Holt (ret., USAF), the immediate past the past Deputy Assistant Secretary of the US Air Force, has spent over three decades leading in the US military, instituting major changes and leaving a lasting impact. So, when he speaks, people learn. His most profound lesson? Trust is earned, not given. According to Holt, loyalty to your employer is owed, but trust must be earned through behavior. And who should initiate this trust? The leader. The leader should trust first. The results of Holt's philosophy were evident at a USAF conference where I had the privilege to give a keynote speech. Many hundreds of officers were attending. I talked to many of them. To the last man and woman, they would go through fire for him. Remember, trust is not something that can be demanded or commanded. It must be earned. As a leader, you need to take the first step in building trust with your team by expressing trust in them through word and action. Give them challenging tasks and don't micromanage how they accomplish it. Be there for advice and support. It will do wonders. #leadership #trust #teamwork If you enjoyed this, share it with others and follow me Jan-Benedict Steenkamp for more writing.\n\nWhere are our todays commanders? I was deeply impressed walking through the Panthéon in Paris, where all the important commanders and senetors are buried. There was one grave which caught immediately my attention, I don't know why because I have not studied anything prior to this visit nor had an audio guide with me. I was attracted by Jean Lannes Duc de Monetbello. He was one of Napoleon's most talented generals, and is regarded by many as one of history's greatest military commanders. Napoleon once commented on Lannes: \"I found him a pygmy and left him a giant\". He fought many battles for Napoleon and got injured many times as he was acting directly at the front together with his soldiers. In his last battle at Enzersdorf his knee pan got smashed and the marshal said, \"I am wounded; it's nothing much; give me your hand to help me up again.\" Unfortunately, he could not stand up and he was carried out and died 8 days later while his leg got amputated. This person was the embodiment of Courage & Humility and Napoleon highly respected him. I stood a while in silence and was thinking are Courage & Humility still values of todays leaders & managers? What are our core values & have those values changed? How to apply to todays leadership? If a leader is willing to have skin in the game and take the risk and losses and fight for a bigger purpose, I recognize that people will follow as a feeling of connection & trust is created. What do you think about the importance of courage & humility to drive today's companies visions? #leadership #Panthéon #courage #humility\n\nGrowing up he was a sickly and wimpy kid. He was picked on a lot. Today, he is a retired Commander of one of the most elite forces in the military. He says he’s not a “front porch” person. He prefers the background. He’s definitely had our backs. What a privilege it was to visit him. We worked together to make this portrait. What have you accomplished that you had thought was impossible? Setbacks and failures are short term, success is a long term pursuit. Keep growing forward. It’s only impossible until you do it. #Leadership #Sales #Growth #Success #Fulfillment #Strategy\n\nThe term “leader” is unique to me because you can define it in so many ways. For me, LTC Hardy O. Johnson’s passion and genuine love for his Soldiers is what makes him the epitome of who a U.S. Military Officer should be. LTC Johnson can walk into any Company, step into any office - and he’ll know every Soldiers’ name and story. He’ll run into any Soldier and ask for updates on how their family and friends are doing - starting off with the previous conversation they had. Regardless of what he was doing, he always let Soldiers know that it never mattered how far he came, he knew why he was in. He’s a walking example what I always remind my Soldiers - your rank and position doesn’t matter until your Soldiers and leaders know you care about them and acknowledge who they are. Until you put that genuine time and effort into your team, they’ll never care if you fail and what will happen if their task isn’t completed. Until they know who you really are as a person, they’ll never understand the ramifications and impact their performance can have on your own perception from a higher up level. That’s when your team will work hard to make sure you don’t fail, not to check the box. He’s my brother for life. I’ll miss meeting up to play basketball, stopping in to talk sports, and those long talks about life. He’s going to change lives wherever he goes, he definitely changed mine. 🇺🇸🪖 #USArmy #USMilitary #Leadership #MilitaryLeadership\n\nThere’s a moment in my favorite book that embodies military leadership. It comes from “Gates of Fire,” a historical novel about the Battle of Thermopylae. Here’s the scene: 300 Spartans are trying to protect Greece from the invading forces of Persia. These 300 warriors realize they must build a wall to defend their people. Everyone is arguing about how to build it and who should do it. Suddenly, they look down, and King Leonidas is placing the first stone. For me, that captures the height of military leadership → action-oriented service transcending the ego. It’s easy to get stuck talking, planning, and posturing. But eventually, it’s time to get to work. The best military community leaders step up and take action, no matter who’s responsible for the work.\n\nOne of these two may be the next Vice President Why's that matter?
