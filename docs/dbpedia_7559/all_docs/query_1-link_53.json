Beginning with his first and perhaps most notable accomplishment, in which he drew up the plans that would eventually become Fall Gelb, the essential first protoype in what would become modern maneuvre warfare, he eventually spent the rest of his career as a field general, fighting against the Soviets in victories such as Fall Barbarossa, the Siege of Sevastopool, as well as the Third Battle of Kharkov, although also suffering his share of defeats as the war dragged on and the tides turned against Germany. Manstein was eventually relieved from his duties due to his disagreements with Hitler in the spring of 1944. After the war, he was held on trial and sentenced for 18 years by the Allies for war crimes*, and after writing the bestseller \"Lost Victories\" in 1955, passed away in 1973 at the age of 85.\n\n*This sentence was not fully served as he was released after 4 years due to health complcations.\n\nMarshal Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov (description by Saltin):\n\nZhukov updated the Soviet army on the use of armor,saved Moscow,destroyed the german army at Stalingrad forcing the surrender of Field Marshall von Paulus forces,coordinated the soviet armies at Kursk and was also in charge of the final capture of Berlin.\n\nSupreme commander of the allied forces Dwight D. Eisenhower (by Thatamericanguy):\n\nDwight Eisehower was the main planner of the Normandy invasion, otherwise known as D-Day, and was also supreme allied commander of Europe during WWII. He served in the war in Europe, and played an important role in Operation Torch and the Italian campaign. He was one of the select few five star generals of the American military ever in history. After the war, Dwight, also known as Ike, became commander of NATO in 1949, and proceeded to run for president in 1952, and won due to his popularity in the war. Notable achievements were ending the Korean War and enforcing the Brown vs B.O.E decision made by the Supreme Court.\n\nPost by Anonymous on\n\nSurprised Eisenhower got so highly rated on Armoured units. In fact, considering the Pershing fiasco and all that, I'd rate him a 3 at best. No idea why his Naval is so damn high either. As for Manstein and Zhukov... well, stereotypical Manstein and Zhukov. Although Manstein being depicted as a god of war is nothing new (personally I consider him slightly overrated), the fact that Zhukov has only a 4 in Armoured yet 5 in both Infantry and Artillery is also questionable though. It should be the opposite, and in fact, his Infantry should be brought down to around a 3- Zhukov was a rather crude man when it came to warfare.\n\nPost by Anonymous on\n\nSounds fun; here's my take on Manstein:\n\nMarshal Erich von Manstein\n\nErich von Manstein was a Prussian-born military officer, noted for his accomplishments while having served in the Wehrmacht during World War II.

After the war, Dwight, also known as Ike, became commander of NATO in 1949, and proceeded to run for president in 1952, and won due to his popularity in the war. Notable achievements were ending the Korean War and enforcing the Brown vs B.O.E decision made by the Supreme Court.\n\nPost by saltin on\n\nGrayfoxcz welcome to the forum,always good to see new faces.As to zhukov I guess his role in the kursk battle is controversial here is what i got from the wiki:\n\n\"Zhukov was a Stavka coordinator at the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. According to his memoirs, he played a central role in the planning of the battle and the hugely successful offensive that followed. Commander of the Central Front Konstantin Rokossovsky, said, however, that the planning and decisions for the Battle of Kursk were made without Zhukov, that he only arrived just before the battle, made no decisions and left soon afterwards, and that Zhukov exaggerated his role.[39]\n\nAnother source:\n\n\"For the advance into occupied eastern Europe, Zhukov used to his advantage the new T-34; a weapon that set new standards for tank design. The victory of the Russians at Kursk gave them a huge advantage over the Germans in terms of armoured warfare\"\n\nlink\n\nThese sources not accurate?"
