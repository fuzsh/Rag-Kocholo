        "text": "Duelling and Napoleonic history go together like a horse and carriage. Though strictly forbidden and disliked by Napoleon, duelling was a very frequent phenomenon in the Grande Armée. It is even possible to speak about a ‘duellomanie’, which caused many (deadly) victims. Nevertheless, for various reasons soldiers crossed blades and duels went according to certain unwritten rules. After an official invitation to go to a certain place at a certain time, a duel, fought with specific weapons, took place under the watchful eye of seconds. Sometimes these duellists wanted to kill their opponent, but in many duels the only intention was to cause a (light) wound. Although duels were honourable and a symbol of masculinity and bravery, they also caused many soldiers to die, not for their country, but in a fight without purpose.\n\nTranslated and edited by Ronald Roberts Beautiful epics will never cease to arouse admiration. Whether the ending is sad or happy, they carry within them the power of events. But more than their historical record, they testify above all to the power of human feelings. The Napoleonic era is unique in that it began and was based on a new order of things inherited from the French Revolution which ended in the mists of Belgium some twenty years later. This new order of things and the warlike events that resulted from it saw an entire generation of men called to the army by vocation, by patriotism, or by the simple drawing of lots. From the Marshal of the Empire to the humble soldier, some of these men have left us their testimonies on the campaigns in which they participated and survived. Along with these, Victor Dupuy gives us the story of what he experienced. Son of a wealthy family, this light horseman who became an officer and then sub-prefect, belonged to those citizens who, through their service, created modern society. If he admits not to comment on strategic and political subjects, his story of an educated man and an officer has a real candour and honesty on the events he witnessed, on his military state and on the men that he met. Having also been a soldier and an officer, my friend Ronald Roberts knows perfectly well that belligerent events are, of course, the fruit of necessary operational, tactical, and strategic warfare, but they are above all, human adventures. What could be more natural than to be interested in the story of Squadron Leader Dupuy and, through him, to grasp this human adventure from one who made military history. Through this story that he delivers for the first time in English, we follow the story of a man and the comrades in his regiment. Like the memoirs of the famous Colonel Marbot, who commanded Dupuy's regiment at Waterloo, the events recounted here seem extraordinary to us today, but they are indeed true. This reality meant that most of their comrades would not return. Yes, beautiful epics always have sad moments, but bringing them back to life is honouring the memory of those who could not tell their own story because they were cut down or shot down while doing their duty. Through the memoirs of Squadron Leader Dupuy and the evocation of the French light cavalry, it is these soldiers of yesterday whose panache, bravery and service that we honour here."
