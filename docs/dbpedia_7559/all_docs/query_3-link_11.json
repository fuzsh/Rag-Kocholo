        "text": "CHAPTER 2\n\nNapoleonic Friendship at the Top\n\nMarshal Lannes, General Duroc, General Junot\n\nAlone in his tent, Napoleon sobbed into his soup. A seasoned soldier and military commander, Napoleon had seen thousands of men die in battle during his many bloody campaigns across Europe. Yet his grief over the death of Marshal Jean Lannes during the Austrian Campaign in 1809 was inconsolable. Gravely wounded in the knees on the battlefield at Essling on the far shores of the Danube River near Vienna, Lannes had survived the amputation of his mangled left leg by Napoleon’s chief army surgeon Dominique-Jean Larrey. Larrey’s best efforts however, could not save Lannes from the excruciating pain and inevitable onset of fever, infection, and gangrene. Following Lannes’s agonizing death on May 31, 1809, Napoleon retreated to his tent where his valet Louis Constant later found the Emperor “seated, immobile, mute, and staring into space, in front of his hastily prepared meal. Napoleon’s eyes were inundated with tears; they multiplied and fell silently into the soup.”1 As Napoleon stared blankly into his bowl, his overwhelming grief spilled out of his weary eyes, down his despondent face, and into his neglected supper.\n\nThis moving account of the Emperor’s private grief demonstrates his great affection for Lannes and his capacity to love and mourn his fellow soldiers and friends. There is overwhelming evidence that Napoleon did not limit his grief for Lannes to the privacy of his own quarters. While one might expect a toughened military leader to hide his feelings from his troops and drown his tears in his soup, Napoleon’s grief for Marshal Lannes took on the very public character of open lamentation. Rather than grieve behind closed doors and conceal his personal vulnerabilities in order to show public strength, Napoleon’s mourning for his beloved friend became a matter of great public spectacle. Like Achilles mourning his beloved Patroclus, Napoleon wept publicly and openly expressed his affection in a way that was widely reported, discussed, and admired by the officers and soldiers in his armies. More than mere tears, Napoleon’s grief over the death of Jean Lannes represented a new military ethos in which even the most hardened soldiers at the very top of the chain of command could express sorrow, tenderness, and affection for their military comrades and friends.\n\nNapoleon’s relationships with three of his most beloved senior officers—Marshal Jean Lannes, General Gérard Christophe Duroc, and General Jean-Andoche Junot—provide models of Napoleonic friendship at the highest ranks of the Grande Armée. From Napoleon’s grief at the deaths of Lannes and Duroc, to Junot’s inverse fanatical devotion to Bonaparte, these friendships illustrate the Emperor’s affection for his men and their cult-like devotion to him. As figures of Napoleonic friendship at the top, these three friendships served as both exemplary and cautionary models for men throughout Napoleon’s armies, from senior and junior officers to sous-officiers and foot soldiers, many of whom emulated these military friendships with their own comrades and wrote about them eloquently in their military memoirs.\n\nNapoleon and Lannes\n\nJean Lannes met Napoleon during the Italian Campaign in 1796 when Lannes was a mere colonel (chef de brigade) in the Revolutionary Army and Bonaparte was a young general. The son of a modest laborer and merchant, Lannes was born in 1769—the same year as Napoleon—and joined the Revolutionary Army in 1792 as a young volunteer. Having distinguished himself in the first Italian Campaign (1796–97), the Egyptian Campaign (1798–99), and the second Italian Campaign (1800), Lannes rose rapidly to the rank of general. Despite a military misappropriations scandal in 1801 for which the First Consul exiled Lannes to an ambassadorial post in Portugal (1802–4), the new Emperor promoted Lannes in 1804 to marshal, the highest rank in the imperial armies. And for Lannes’s victory over the Austrians in Italy on June 9, 1800, Napoleon later named him Duc de Montebello in 1808. In addition to these early victories, Lannes was instrumental in Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz (1805) and during the Prussian and Polish Campaigns (1806–7), Iberian Campaign (1808–9), and Austrian Campaign (1809). Lannes was Napoleon’s friend of sixteen years, one of his most talented military leaders, and a decorated soldier who had been wounded an extraordinary thirteen times in battle. His death was an enormous loss for France and Napoleon, the Empire and the Emperor.\n\nBoth men were known for their iron will, courage in battle, and toughened military character. During their lifetime military careers, they had witnessed the agony and death of thousands on the field of battle. Yet multiple witnesses report that Napoleon was overwhelmed with grief on seeing Lannes’s wounded body. Echoing the moving account of the marshal’s aide-de-camp General Marcellin de Marbot, General Jean-Marie-René Savary confirms that Napoleon “was visibly affected and shed tears,” and General Louis-François Lejeune attests that “[t]he Emperor had thrown himself on his friend, embraced him, held him in his arms, and bathed his face with his tears.”2 In more detailed terms, General Jean-Jacques-Germain Pelet writes how Napoleon—using the informal tuto address Lannes—consoled his wounded friend:\n\nAs soon as the Emperor saw him, he ran, hastened to him, covered him with kisses. He called to him in the middle of his sobs, and said to him in a muffled voice: ‘Lannes, my friend, do you recognize me? It’s me, it’s the Emperor. It’s Bonaparte, your friend!’ … Napoleon, kneeling before the dying hero, cried hot tears. This most touching meeting, these most tender embraces moved us profoundly … The Emperor’s pain was so intense that none of the witnesses to this scene could ever deny the profound feeling that it inspired.3\n\nThese multiple references to Napoleon’s tears, embraces, and kisses stand in contrast to the more stoic images of Napoleon in paintings by David, Gros, and Ingres. Napoleon’s overwhelming grief is particularly moving because it is so wholly uncharacteristic. A forty-year-old man with almost twenty years of combat experience, Napoleon would have been accustomed to the carnage of battle and the inevitable loss of comrades. His open display of affection at the death of Lannes also belies his characteristic confidence, ruthlessness, and aggression on the battlefield.\n\nOther accounts confirm the reports made by Generals Marbot, Lejeune, Savary, and Pelet. In his best-selling collection of conversations with Napoleon in exile, The Memorial of Saint Helena (1823), Emmanuel de Las Cases explains how “Lannes was transported to the isle of Lobau; Napoleon went to meet him near the small bridge. Their meeting was most touching, their embraces most tender. Napoleon cried hot tears on his knees before the dying hero.”4 In similar terms, General Comte Philippe-Paul de Ségur confirms in his memoirs how, in the presence of other tearful soldiers, Napoleon wept and comforted his fallen comrade:\n\nNapoleon, dismayed, saw our grenadiers all in tears as they carried the dying hero to the island. At this sight, he hastened towards him, threw his arms around him, melted in tears, and covered his face with kisses … The witnesses who are still alive all say that, through the tears that moistened their eyes, they saw Napoleon on his knees for a long time, his head leaning on the head of the unfortunate marshal, covering him with tears.5\n\nIn all of these reports, Napoleon’s weeping is unapologetically documented as the sign of his intimate affection for Lannes. These military memoirs reproduce the tearful scenes that had become a common trope of the Romantic novel. Like Chactas at the death and funeral of the title character in Chateaubriand’s Atala (1801), Napoleon’s lamentation on the death of Lannes in the military memoirs of the Empire figure him as a kind of melancholic, Romantic hero.6\n\nNapoleon’s valet Louis Constant and his pharmacist Cadet de Gassicourt would later claim that in his agony, Lannes had berated the Emperor for his insatiable ambition and never-ending wars, but these accounts were vehemently refuted by Generals Marbot, Savary, and Pelet who attest in their memoirs to Lannes’s warrior spirit and loyalty to Napoleon till the end.7 Lannes’s biographers, Margaret Scott Chrisawn, Jean-Claude Damamme, and Ronald Zins, attribute Lannes’s alleged deathbed accusations to either the unconscious ramblings of a man in great pain or the later invention of anti-Bonapartist propaganda during the Restoration.8 Even if Lannes had confronted Napoleon, this frank, deathbed criticism would only confirm the familiarity and intimacy that Lannes shared with the Emperor. Collectively, the memoirs of Marbot, Constant, Savary, Lejeune, Pelet, Las Cases, and Ségur corroborate the Emperor’s tearful despondency at Essling and verify that the death of Lannes represented not only a major military loss for the Grande Armée but a deep personal loss for Bonaparte.\n\nNapoleon did not count many people as friends. The corruption of power and influence made him weary of friendship, flattery, and false intimacy. In 1802, Napoleon told his secretary Louis de Bourrienne, “Friendship is just a word; I don’t love anyone … Personally, I couldn’t care less. I know very well that I have no true friends.”9 Ironically, Napoleon confided this complaint to Bourrienne, a man whom he had known since their school days at the Royal Military School in Brienne (1779–84), and whom years later Napoleon dismissed and blacklisted after ten years of loyal service.10 While Napoleon was weary of false friendship, he could also prove to be an unforgiving and disloyal friend. But by 1809, after thirty years as a soldier and ten years in power as First Consul and Emperor, Napoleon had come to depend on the friendship and expertise of rare men like Lannes whom he described as adoring and dependable: “Lannes adored me … He was surely one of the men on whom I could most depend in this world.”11\n\nFollowing the death of Lannes, Napoleon expressed this friendship in even stronger terms in a letter to the marshal’s wife, Louise, on May 31, 1809: “My pain is equal to your own. I lost the most distinguished general of my armies, my companion in arms of sixteen years, the one I considered my best friend.”12 Seven years later, while in exile on St. Helena, Napoleon remembered how, on his friend’s deathbed, Lannes had expressed his devotion to both his family and the Emperor: “he clung to me … for the rest of his life; he wanted only me, thought only of me … Certainly, he loved his wife and children more than me; nevertheless, he never spoke about it because he expected nothing of it; he was the one who protected them, while in turn, I was his protector.”13 Just as Lannes protected his wife, so did Napoleon protect Lannes, in a kind of military marriage of mutual admiration and affection.\n\nLannes, in turn, was also loved and admired by his own officers. Louis Constant reports that Napoleon was not the only one sobbing at Lannes’s deathbed: “What a touching and terrible thing to see—surrounding his house, at his door, in his bedroom—these old hardened grenadiers of the Imperial Guard crying and sobbing.”14 Lejeune confirms that “on seeing the Emperor so moved, melting in tears … all of our hearts were torn with an equally sincere pain; immediately one saw tears running from the eyes of all those tough old soldiers.”15 This communal grief for Lannes reflected, in turn, the marshal’s own affection for his men. In fact, Lannes was mortally wounded while mourning the death of his dear friend General Pierre Charles Pouzet, who had been killed just minutes before at Essling. In some ways, Lannes and Pouzet’s friendship mirrored the long-term military mentorship between Lannes and Napoleon. Lannes had met Pouzet in 1792, when Lannes was a young volunteer and Pouzet was his sergeant major at the training camp in Mirail. Following his promotion to marshal by Napoleon in 1804, Lannes later named his former drill instructor Pouzet to his senior staff. At Essling, Lannes and Pouzet were talking when a stray Prussian bullet penetrated Pouzet’s head, killing him instantly. Devastated, Lannes sat down on the ground, crossed his legs, and held his own head in his hands. It was while he sat mourning the loss of his beloved Pouzet that a piece of shrapnel struck and wounded Lannes in the knees. As Lannes had mourned Pouzet, so would Napoleon mourn Lannes.\n\nThis triangle of Napoleonic military affections recalls the epic grief between Charlemagne, Roland, and Olivier in the Song of Roland. The similarities between the Emperors Charlemagne and Napoleon, their lamentation at the death of Roland and Lannes, and the loss of the heroes’ own comrades Olivier and Pouzet were noted by Napoleon himself and several officers in the Grande Armée. In The Memorial of Saint Helena, Las Cases recounts how Napoleon twice referred to Lannes as “the Roland of the army” (94) and describes the death of Lannes in parallel terms with the Song of Roland: “The Emperor also spoke of the last moments of Marshal Lannes, the valorous Duke of Montebello, so justly called the Roland of the army, who, visited by the Emperor on his deathbed, seemed to forget his own condition to tend to him whom he loved above everything” (143–44). Later in The Memorial of Saint Helena, Napoleon recalls how “Lannes was the Achilles of the army” (409) and thus extends the epic metaphor from theSong of Rolandto the Iliad.16\n\nIn addition to Napoleon, both junior and senior officers describe Lannes as a latter-day Roland. In his memoirs, Lieutenant François-Frédéric Billon writes of his beloved Marshal Lannes, “We loved him, that intrepid leader, he was our Roland … he was for theGrande Armée a demi-god, the demi-god of war.”17 Similarly, the Comte de Ségur recalls how Napoleon ordered a grandiose state funeral for his beloved friend: “[Lannes] was the Roland of his Empire, his most beloved hero! He wanted the remains of this most regretted companion-in-arms to be transported to the dome of the Invalides, to immortalize his pain by this tomb surrounded by the glorious veterans of our great wars” (3: 360–61). Just as Achilles and Charlemagne had ordered the public funeral rites of Patroclus and Roland, so did Napoleon order an elaborate state funeral for Lannes.\n\nFollowing the marshal’s death, the Grande Armée’s chief surgeon Dr. Larrey organized the complicated embalming of Lannes’s body, which was then transferred to the Hôtel de Ville in Strasbourg. There it remained for a year until the state funeral in 1810, which began on May 22 in Strasbourg and lasted until July 6 in Paris, the first anniversaries of the battles of Essling and Wagram. From Strasbourg, Lannes’s casket was draped in black, honored by Mozart’s Requiem Mass at the Strasbourg Cathedral, and transported with a military cortege and great public ceremony across eastern France. In Paris, the marshal lay in state between July 2 and July 6 under the dome of the Invalides before again being transported in a grand funeral procession through the streets of the capital where, amid cannon-fire and church-bells, Lannes was laid to rest in the crypt of the Panthéon on July 6 alongside the nation’s other celebrated leaders, writers, and heroes.\n\nIn terms that rival Camille Desmoulins’s account of the Fête de la Féderation in 1790, Louis Constant describes in detail the elaborate ceremonies at both the Invalides and Panthéon in 1810, as well as the lengthy procession that included a military cortège of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, a religious cortége of clergy, acolytes, and choirs from almost every parish in Paris, and a cortège d’honneur that included the marshal’s widow, five children, and family, hundreds of imperial princes, dignitaries, and ministers, and scores of distinguished marshals, generals, and colonels of the Grande Armée.18 Everyone, it seems, was present except Napoleon. In the absence of the Emperor, Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout delivered Lannes’s funeral oration:\n\n[Lannes] received the most beautiful sign of [Napoleon’s] devotion when, on hearing the news of his mortal wounds, the Emperor suspended his vast maneuvers in the middle of combat to go and comfort him, to share the last hours of this great friend he was about to lose, and to pronounce these memorable words that the centuries will remember: ‘Only a painful blow to my heart such as this could distract me from the needs of my army.’ Happy is he who, in dying, can inspire such regrets and merit such tears.19\n\nFor those mourners who had not seen Napoleon’s tears on the battlefield at Essling, Davout’s eulogy transformed Napoleon’s private grief for Lannes into a matter of public spectacle. For many, the Emperor’s absence at Lannes’s funeral underscored his overwhelming sense of loss.20 While Napoleon the soldier had wept openly for his comrade on the battlefield in 1809, Napoleon the Emperor would not risk such a display of affection at the state funeral of his marshal in 1810. This distinction between the private man and the public emperor accentuates the pathos of Napoleon’s grief. Despite or perhaps even because of the Emperor’s absence, this funerary ritual elevated Napoleon’s love for Lannes to the level of national discourse.\n\nAccording to what Jean Tulard calls the Napoleonic myth or legend, the Emperor is an enigmatic repository of all kinds of collective fantasies and interpretations.21 In his public life, Napoleon is both saint and demon, benefactor and butcher, a benevolent liberator bringing law and order to the peoples of Europe and a totalitarian dictator wreaking death and destruction in his mega-lomaniacal thirst for power. General Bonaparte shines as the hero of Marengo, the conqueror of Egypt, and the champion of Austerlitz. First Consul Bonaparte is lauded as the soldier who brought order to a state in chaos. Emperor Napoleon is hallowed as the great conqueror of an empire that stretched across continental Europe. However, the general, consul, and emperor are also collectively known as the mythic ogre who ravaged Europe, sent generations of soldiers to their deaths, and bloodied the battlefields of Eylau, Borodino, and Waterloo. He is blamed for abandoning his men in Egypt, deserting his armies in Russia, and forsaking his soldiers in Spain. Adored by his Imperial Guard, who regularly risked their lives to protect him, Napoleon also suffered from mass desertion and draft evasion among both the French and foreign soldiers of his Grande Armée. While the Napoleonic myth emphasizes the ubiquitous chant of “Long Live the Emperor!,” other cries of “Long Live Peace!” are said to have been heard among Napoleon’s wounded and dying soldiers.\n\nNapoleon’s legendary friendship with Lannes participates in this Napoleonic myth and is thus susceptible to both misinterpretation and overstatement. But it is no exaggeration to say that the death of Jean Lannes marked the end of a great friendship, and made public Napoleon’s ability to offer comfort, feel pain, and shed tears for a fellow soldier. As if to compensate for Lannes’s shattered legs, Napoleon offered his arms, in an embrace that recalls the earlier fraternal oaths and embraces of their Revolutionary youth. By reproducing both the fraternal gestures and melancholic pathos of the funerary rites in the Iliad, the Song of Roland, and the Romantic novel, Napoleon and Lannes take part in an epic heroic tradition. In describing the death of Lannes in these terms, Napoleonic witnesses, memoirists, and biographers perpetuate this narrative and iconographic myth. Despite their seemingly limitless variation, these accounts concur that Napoleon did indeed weep, trading his weapons for tears, his armes for larmes, to mourn his beloved friend.\n\nNapoleon and Duroc\n\nIn many ways, the death of Lannes in 1809 was echoed by the death of General Gérard Christophe Duroc in 1813.22 Duroc had been Napoleon’s close friend and comrade since the siege of Toulon in 1793, the Revolutionary victory that had first propelled the young Captain Bonaparte to the rank of major, then brigadier general, and to national recognition. Twenty years later, during Napoleon’s Saxon Campaign in 1813, the Emperor and Duroc were riding side by side during the battle of Bautzen when a cannonball ricocheted off a tree, narrowly missing Napoleon, but disemboweling Duroc. According to Louis Constant’s eyewitness account, “The despairing Emperor embraced his faithful friend several times, trying to offer some hope, but [Duroc], who knew perfectly well his condition, did not answer except to beg for opium. At these words, no longer able to bear it, Napoleon left” (4: 38–39). Duroc spent the rest of the day and night in agony, and died the next morning, on May 23, 1813. Unable to remain with his suffering friend, the despondent Emperor had returned to his camp where, according to Constant, Napoleon “sat down on a stool in front of his tent, his head hung low, his hands gripped together, and … remained for almost an hour without saying a single word” (4: 38–39).\n\nAs with Lannes, Duroc was mourned by both Napoleon and the nation. Constant writes that “[t]he Emperor’s heart was broken … This was a loss not only for the Emperor, who considered him a true friend, but I daresay a loss for all of France” (4: 36–37). And as with Lannes, Napoleon ordered both rituals and monuments to honor this imperial hero and beloved friend: “The Emperor ordered that his body be transported to Paris to lie in state under the dome of the Invalides; he bought the house in which [Duroc] had died, and asked the village minister to place on the spot a stone … ‘Here, General Duroc, Duke of Frioul, Grand Marshal of the Imperial Palace of the Emperor Napoleon, wounded by a bullet, died in the arms of the Emperor, his friend’ ” (4: 39–40). Yet again, Napoleon’s private grief translated into public mourning.\n\nIn the Memorial of Saint Helena, Las Cases writes that Napoleon valued Duroc’s capacity for “loving the Emperor for himself” and “knowing to speak the truth” (58). Convinced that Duroc was “devoted to his well-being … [t]he Emperor told me that Duroc alone had his trust and possessed his entire confidence” (58). Like Constant, Las Cases recounts the horrific conditions of Duroc’s death in Saxony: “When [Napoleon] went to see Duroc after his mortal injury, he tried to give him hope; but Duroc, who did not delude himself, only responded by imploring [Napoleon] to give him opium. The Emperor, too moved, could not take it upon himself to remain any longer and withdrew from this heartbreaking spectacle” (144). As both Constant and Las Cases report, Napoleon’s inability to remain with Duroc seems to have had more to do with the emotional pain of seeing his friend suffer than the physical effects of a weak stomach. Napoleon had braved the stench of Lannes’s gangrene to be with him at his deathbed in 1809 and must have witnessed countless scenes of carnage no less gruesome than Duroc’s disembowelment in 1813. But having already lost his beloved Lannes, Napoleon could not bear to watch Duroc die in agony.\n\nAccording to Las Cases, the Emperor’s grief reflected Duroc’s own affection for Napoleon. Their mutual friendship was based on an intimate familiarity, outside the rigid formality of the imperial court and chain of military command. Although he was never promoted to marshal, Duroc’s role as Napoleon’s aidede-camp and Grand Marshal of the Imperial Palace afforded the kind of daily access and intimate involvement with the Emperor that would have been impossible had Duroc been assigned to distant military posts. In addition, Duroc was reportedly the only one of Napoleon’s officers besides Lannes who was allowed to use the familiar tu with the Emperor.23 Las Cases reports that this familiarity signaled Napoleon’s favor with Duroc and, in turn, Duroc’s ability to treat Napoleon as both emperor and friend: “I’ve heard the Emperor say that in all of his military career, Duroc alone possessed his blind confidence and received all his affection … Duroc loved the Emperor for himself; he was devoted most of all to the private man, even more than to the monarch” (144).\n\nMemoirists and biographers have debated whether Napoleon was closer to Lannes or Duroc. While Las Cases reports that Duroc bested Lannes in Napoleon’s affections, General Pierre Berthezène argues in his memoirs “I am tempted to believe that Lannes is the only man that Napoleon truly loved. I have since seen the death of … Duroc; but how differently [Napoleon] was affected!”24 Similarly, Captain Jean-Roch Coignet writes in his memoirs how, at a Parisian military inspection in 1808, Napoleon “was accompanied by Marshal Lannes, his favorite.”25 Ultimately, Napoleon’s preference for Lannes or Duroc is less important than the intimacy he shared and the love he expressed for both men. Like his grief at the death of Jean Lannes, Napoleon’s anguish over the death of Gérard Christophe Duroc provides a rare example of the Emperor’s demonstrated affection for a beloved soldier and friend.\n\nWhile the deaths of Lannes and Duroc offer only a glimpse of Napoleon’s long-term relationships with these men, they serve as models of Napoleonic friendship at the top and demonstrate at least three new forms of intimacy between soldiers in the Grande Armée. First, these models tacitly give permission for a soldier to express affection for a fellow comrade. Second, they suggest that if an emperor can openly love a general or marshal, then officers can in turn love the soldiers under their command. Third, they imply that while the Emperor loved some of his officers, many officers also loved the Emperor. These three forms of Napoleonic friendship—lateral relationships between soldiers of similar rank, compassionate relationships between leaders and their men, and devotional relationships between soldiers and their superiors—formed the basis for relationships throughout the Grande Armée.26 During the Empire, this third model of affection—by subordinates for their superiors—accounted for the legendary and cultish adoration of Napoleon by many of his men. One of the most extreme cases of this hero-worship was the devotion of General Jean-Andoche Junot, whose fanatical service to Napoleon as both a friend and officer echoed the tropes of a turbulent epistolary romance.\n\nNapoleon and Junot\n\nJunot’s passionate devotion to Napoleon bordered on obsession. In 1813, after a lifetime of service to Bonaparte, General Junot wrote a final and desperate letter to his longtime friend, the Emperor: “I who love you with the affection of a savage for the sun, I who am ENTIRELY YOURS. Well then: this eternal war that we must fight for you, I WANT NO MORE OF IT! I WANT PEACE!”27 After twenty years of service as Bonaparte’s intimate friend, general, aide-de-camp, and Commandant of Paris—a period during which he suffered an astounding twenty-seven battle wounds and the long-term effects of head trauma—Junot was refused promotion to marshal, dismissed from military duty, and exiled to a marginal ambassadorial post in eastern Europe. It was during this time in exile that the symptoms of Junot’s accumulated head wounds became acute and the ambassador’s behavior degenerated into scandal, forcing him to return to France where, on July 29, 1813, Junot died of self-inflicted wounds.\n\nOn hearing the news of Junot’s death, Napoleon sent a messenger to the general’s home with orders to seize and destroy his letters. Mysteriously, Napoleon feared that the contents of their twenty-year correspondence might be made public. In burning Junot’s letters, Napoleon ironically underscored his embarrassment over these expressions of epistolary affection and stoked the fires of rumor and speculation. Of the few letters that survive, five in particular—from Toulon, Egypt, Portugal, Russia, and Illyria—provide an intimate glance into the nature of Junot’s devotion to Napoleon. However, since Napoleon destroyed most of Junot’s letters, much of what is known about their passionate friendship relies on the celebrated memoirs of the general’s wife, Laure Junot, the Duchesse d’Abrantès.\n\nBorn Laure Permon, the future Madame Junot hailed from a family of the Corsican nobility that had maintained an intimate and long-term friendship with the Bonaparte family. In fact, Napoleon once had a serious infatuation with Laure’s widowed mother, Laetetia Permon, and it was Napoleon himself who later introduced the sixteen-year-old Laure Permon to her future husband, Jean-Andoche Junot. Napoleon and Josephine later agreed to be the godparents of the Junots’ first child, who was named in honor of the Empress. The christening of the infant Josephine was hosted by the imperial couple at Mal-maison, where Marshal Lannes’s own infant son was simultaneously baptized and named Napoleon. As christening presents, the Empress gave Madame Junot a pearl necklace and the Emperor gave General Junot the deed to a lavish mansion on the Champs-Élysées, where Madame Junot would entertain, as befit her husband’s role as Napoleon’s future military Commandant of Paris.28\n\nWritten much later during the July Monarchy at the encouragement of her friend Honoré de Balzac, Laure Junot’s celebrated Memoirs of the Duchesse d’Abrantès (1831–34) are a rich source by a privileged witness of the Empire and an important, if biased, record of Junot’s devotion to Napoleon. Doubtless, the extremes of Junot’s devotion are often exaggerated by Laure Junot, who hoped to champion her husband’s role and her own memoirs in the annals of Napo-leonic history. While one must be skeptical of Laure Junot’s account, one cannot ignore her version of General Junot’s story, especially when her interpretation closely seconds other sources.29 Most of what is known about the friendship between General Junot and Napoleon must be gleaned between the lines of Junot’s remaining letters and his wife’s memoirs, which collectively reflect the literary spirit of the late eighteenth-century epistolary novel and the mal du siècle of early nineteenth-century Romanticism. From their cavalier seduction on the battlefield at Toulon and the shared intimacies of their youth in Paris, to Junot’s blind loyalty, later disillusionment, and madness, Junot’s lifelong devotion to Napoleon reads like an epistolary novel by Prévost, Laclos, or Rousseau and concludes with as much despair and melancholic ennui as the Romantic novels of Chateaubriand, Constant, and Stendhal.\n\nLike Duroc, Junot gained the attention of the young Bonaparte at the siege of Toulon in 1793. His first major military victory, Bonaparte’s triumph over French royalists and their English allies in Toulon distinguished him as an important Revolutionary figure, earned him promotion to the rank of brigadier general, and gained him national recognition. Given Napoleon’s later destruction of Junot’s letters following Junot’s death, it is ironic that at Toulon, Major Bonaparte and Sergeant Junot met over the writing of a letter. In the Memorial of Saint Helena, Las Cases explains:\n\nDuring the construction of one of the first batteries that Napoleon, on his arrival at Toulon, ordered built against the English, he asked in the field for a sergeant or corporal who knew how to write. Someone stepped out of the ranks and wrote what [Napoleon] dictated, on the retaining wall itself. The letter was barely finished when … cannon-fire sprayed it with dirt. ‘Good,’ said the writer, ‘now I won’t need any sand [to dry the ink].’ This joke and the calm with which it was made, drew Napoleon’s attention and made the sergeant’s fortune: this was Junot. (58)\n\nIn this account, Napoleon and Junot’s first meeting reads like an epistolary seduction. Bonaparte is impressed by Junot’s eagerness to serve as well as by his sense of humor, unshakable nerve, and courage under fire. Laure Junot recounts the story in almost identical terms:\n\nBonaparte asked for someone with beautiful handwriting; Junot stepped out of the ranks and presented himself. Bonaparte … told him to prepare to write a letter under his dictation. Junot wrote on the retaining wall of the battery itself. He had barely finished the letter when an English bomb exploded ten feet away, covering Junot and the letter with dirt. ‘Good!’ said Junot while laughing, ‘we didn’t have any sand to dry the ink.’ Bonaparte fixed his gaze on the young sergeant; [Junot] was calm and had not even flinched. This event decided his fortune. (1: 391)\n\nLaure Junot goes on to describe, in passionate and exaggerated terms, Junot’s total devotion to Napoleon: “He soon attached himself to his general with a devotion that became a kind of religion” (1: 391–92). This cultish devotion that began at Toulon over the writing of a letter can be seen in five surviving letters between the two men—from Toulon (1794), Egypt (1799), Portugal (1808), Russia (1812), and Illyria (1813)—which span the twenty years of their friendship and dramatize Junot’s sometimes moving yet fanatical devotion to Napoleon.\n\nLetter from Toulon (1794)\n\nFollowing his victory at Toulon in 1793, Brigadier General Bonaparte was falsely accused of treason in the wake of Robespierre’s fall from power in 1794. Imprisoned, Bonaparte received a letter from Junot pledging his loyalty and promising to free Napoleon by force, if necessary. To this personal declaration of loyalty, Napoleon replied: “I well know your friendship, my dear Junot, from the offer you’re making; for a long time you have also known the friendship that I have vowed to you … [But] do nothing, for you would compromise me. Goodbye, my dear Junot. Salutations and friendship, Bonaparte” (Junot 1: 162). Echoing the old Jacobin greeting of “salutations and fraternity,” Bonaparte’s farewell wishes indicate how his friendship with Junot grew out of the military fraternity of the Revolution. Confirming that Junot’s feelings for Napoleon were equally fraternal, Laure Junot writes that her future husband was “devoted to General Bonaparte with a fraternal tenderness” (11: 131). Here one can see a direct link between Revolutionary fraternity and the early evolution of Napoleonic friendship.\n\nSoon after his imprisonment, Napoleon was released and exonerated, but with little money and no desire to take on a new military post in Brittany, he returned to Paris where, as Laure Junot explains, he lived with his comrade Junot and depended on his friend’s emotional and financial support: “At that time, having returned to Paris, Bonaparte was without resources … [and] truly miserable. Junot, who often spoke to me about those six months that they spent in Paris … gave him all that he received from his family” (1: 187–88). The 1794 letter from Toulon thus initiates a half-year period in the lives of the twenty-five-year-old Bonaparte and twenty-three-year-old Junot when, like Rastignac and Bianchon in Balzac’s Old Goriot (1834–35), these ambitious young men relied on each other during their impecunious days in Paris. Describing how Junot “loved Bonaparte as one loves at the age” (1: 188), Laure Junot implies that the young Jean-Andoche developed an adolescent crush on Napoleon, as the two young men grew in intimacy.\n\nIn one particularly florid passage, Laure Junot describes Bonaparte and Junot’s evening stroll in a Parisian park: “One evening, they took a stroll in the Jardin des Plantes. These solitary promenades always had a great charm for Bonaparte; he felt more at ease, confident, and closer to divinity, for which a true friend, he said, was the faithful image” (1: 188). Here again, Laure Junot speaks of an idealized adolescent friendship in which the companion is not only charmed but venerated. Amid the luxuriant foliage and perfumed air of the Jardin des Plantes, Junot’s and Napoleon’s friendship is described in terms that echo the pastoral romances of Abbé Prévost’s Manon Lescaut (1731) and Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s Paul et Virginie (1788) as well as the Romantic landscapes of Chateaubriand’s Atala (1801) and René (1802):\n\nThey plunged into the shadows where they found the air heavy with the perfume of thousands of blooming rosebushes that filled the flowerbeds. The air was soft and cool; the two friends walked slowly, silently holding each other by the arm, squeezing each other’s arms from time to time, as if to consult the heart and respond. At this moment, the two friends were much closer … [D]uring this beautiful evening, swimming in this soft, brilliant, perfumed atmosphere, surrounded by lush greenery, garlands, thickets, and the most wonderful, fragrant flowers, speaking to one another, heart to heart, they were then much closer the one to the other than they have ever been since. (1: 190)\n\nJuxtaposing the siege of Toulon in 1793 with the idyllic Jardin des Plantes in 1794, Laure Junot reproduces the literary tropes of pastoral romance and casts a softer light on Napoleon’s and Junot’s otherwise violent military youth. Having won Napoleon’s favor on the battlefield, Junot now shares with him the arm-inarm and heart-to-heart intimacies of silent evening walks. Their stroll amid the shadows and intoxicating flowers of this Parisian park recalls the cruising habits of eighteenth-century lovers in the Tuileries and prefigures the floral flamboyance of later nineteenth-century dandies and flâneurs.30\n\nThis early adolescent intimacy between Napoleon and Junot has fueled speculation on the nature of their relationship.31 Comparing Napoleon’s friendships with Generals Junot and Duroc, Laure Junot tactfully observed many years later that it was difficult to assess the nature of these friendships without offending their masculinity: “These are the very profound and abstract mysteries of the human heart. It is difficult to explain them without first wounding a man’s dignity” (11: 131). In relegating Napoleon’s military relationships to the realm of the mysterious, Laure Junot defines Napoleonic friendship—long before “the love that dare not speak its name” was articulated by Lord Alfred Douglas in 1894 and invoked at Oscar Wilde’s trial in 1895—as an enigmatic and unspeakable love incapable of being articulated without shaming a soldier’s manhood.32 Amid such ambiguity, it is unclear if such “mysteries” encompass both the emotional and the erotic. What is clearer is that Napoleon and Junot shared a degree of affection during their youth in Paris that was undeniably intimate.\n\nFollowing his 1794 promenade with Junot in the Jardin des Plantes, Napoleon distinguished himself again by his victory over the Tuileries rebellion in 1795, an achievement that earned him the renewed trust of the Revolutionary authorities and the command of the Armée d’Italie. From this position, General Bonaparte launched his successful first Italian Campaign (1796–97) and then his mythic Egyptian Campaign (1798–99). Because of Junot’s continued devotion, the rumors about him and Napoleon persisted among French soldiers in both Italy and Egypt. Despite Napoleon’s attempts to distance himself from his well-meaning but doting friend, Junot’s behavior did nothing to stem the gossip.\n\nLetter from Egypt (1799)\n\nDuring the Egyptian Campaign, Napoleon promoted Junot to general, an advancement that was both a personal victory for the young twenty-seven-year-old officer and a disappointment since it meant that he would have to leave his position as Napoleon’s aide-de-camp and assume his own command. As Laure Junot explains, General Junot was deeply saddened by this separation since “He was leaving the man that he tenderly loved” (2: 2). In her account of General Junot in Egypt, Laure Junot describes the young man’s love as a sacred fire, a blind and passionate devotion bordering on worship: “The fire which nourished this love was sacred. Many generals loved the Emperor … but nothing ever approached this blind, passionate devotion bordering on séidisme which several of his officers felt for him, most especially Junot” (2: 1). Here again, Laure Junot’s exaggeration reflects both her hyperbolic style and personal bias, but her reference to General Junot’s fanatical séidisme is consistent with the many rumors associated with Napoleon’s Egyptian Campaign.\n\nDerived from the Arabic, the French word séide finds its origins in a seventh-century figure named Zayd ibn Haritha, a slave who, having been freed and adopted by Mohammed, was fanatically devoted to the prophet. While a similar character named Zaïd appears in Voltaire’s eighteenth-century tragedy Mohamet (1741), the word séide entered popular usage in France during the nineteenth century to signify a person who was fanatically devoted to Napoleon.33 Just as Laure Junot refers to her husband as a séide or blind follower of Napoleon, so was General Bonaparte widely rumored to have pacified the conquered Egyptians by converting to Islam and becoming a séide of Mohammed and Allah. The rumor was not true, but neither were the reports of Napoleon’s great success in Egypt. While news of Bonaparte’s conquest of the pyramids made him a living legend back in France, the Egyptian Campaign was an unmitigated military disaster. Despite the early French victories at Cairo and Alexandria, Napoleon’s army suffered crippling heat, disease, and resistance by the occupying Ottomans, Egyptians, and English, whose naval victory at Aboukir effectively trapped the French in Egypt. In the end, two-thirds of Napoleon’s thirty-six thousand soldiers died of combat and disease during the Egyptian Campaign, which Napoleon abruptly abandoned in order to return to France, stage his coup d’état in Paris on November 9, 1799, and assume power as First Consul.34\n\nAmong his disillusioned troops, reports of Napoleon’s Islamic séidisme gave way to rumors of his military sadism. While Antoine Gros’s Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa (1804) portrays Napoleon as a kind of Christ figure saving the sick and the dying, rumors spread among Napoleon’s men that he had ordered his own wounded to be poisoned in order to avoid the tactical burden of evacuating them. This culture of rumor during the Egyptian Campaign explains, at least in part, the kind of resentful gossip that arose among Napoleon’s soldiers about Bonaparte’s relationship with Junot. While Laure Junot speaks of her husband as a devoted séide or loyal disciple of Napoleon, others may have used séidisme as an orientalist code word for Junot’s curiously passionate and emotional attachment to Bonaparte. The growing hostility of the French army toward General Bonaparte also explains why Junot’s continued acts of Napoleonic séidisme stood out as particularly suspect, especially when Junot’s devotion took on the appearance of chivalric romance.\n\nDespite Bonaparte’s strict prohibition of dueling among his officers, Junot challenged Brigadier General Pierre Lanusse to a duel on the banks of the Nile in 1799 because of Lanusse’s open disapproval of Napoleon’s leadership. Addressing his opponent, Junot reportedly said, “We must fight; it is essential that only one of us survive. I hate you because you hate the man that I love and admire as much as God, if not more” (Junot 2: 5). The very nature of Junot’s challenge—as a gentlemen’s duel—seems awkwardly inappropriate amid a ferocious military campaign, especially one in which many of Bonaparte’s officers were openly and justifiably critical of his tactical decisions, political motives, and questionable leadership.35 While Junot’s loyalty to Bonaparte can be interpreted as a mark of military duty, Junot’s language oddly recalls the literary tropes of both the medieval chivalric roman and the eighteenth-century epistolary novel. Like Lancelot defending the honor of Guenièvre in Chrétien de Troyes’s Chevalier à la charrette (c. 1170) or the young Chevalier Danceny dueling Valmont to defend the honor of Cécile de Volanges in Laclos’s Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782), Junot commits himself to defending the honor of the “man that [he] love[s]” and admires as a god in what awkwardly smacks as either obsequious flattery or gross infatuation.\n\nBoth Lanusse and Junot were seriously wounded with saber lacerations to the face and chest. Napoleon was reportedly furious, but was said to have later remarked, “My poor Junot … wounded for me!” (Junot 2: 8). Before his abrupt departure from Egypt and return to France, Napoleon wrote Junot a farewell letter explaining, “I’m leaving Egypt, my dear Junot. You are too far away from my port of departure for me to take you with me … In whatever place or position that I find myself, be assured that I will give you positive proof of the tender friendship that I vowed to you. Salutations and Friendship, Bonaparte” (Junot 2: 8). Napoleon’s Egyptian letter illustrates the distinction between the general, who was publicly furious at the insubordination of his officers, and the friend, who was privately moved by Junot’s loyalty. But the romance wouldn’t last. Napoleon would not forget his promise in this Egyptian letter to repay Junot for his loyalty, but Junot’s fanatical séidisme, which had flowered from adolescent infatuation in Paris to a kind of chivalric devotion in Egypt, would need to be tempered.\n\nLetter from Portugal (1808)\n\nNapoleon’s return to France in 1799 and ascent to power as First Consul necessitated a radical change in the public relationship between Bonaparte and Junot. In a word, the rumors had to be squelched. While Bonaparte overlooked the notorious sodomy of his brilliant Second Consul Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, he needed a future military Commandant of Paris with a wife capable of entertaining his senior officers in the capital, where he could closely monitor their loyalty.36 Junot was his first choice for this post but, as Napoleon told him during another garden stroll at Malmaison in 1799, Junot would have to marry: “I am going to name you Commandant of Paris, just as I told you; but you must marry. This is necessary, not only for the dignity of the position you are going to occupy but … for your own best interests” (Junot 2: 181). Doubtless as concerned for the dignity of his own position as he was for Junot, Napoleon ordered his future Commandant of Paris to wed. While Napoleon did not mind the public intimacy of their 1794 stroll in the Jardin des Plantes, he used this 1799 walk in the gardens of Malmaison to engineer a radical change in the public perception of their friendship.37 While the early years of their relationship had been marked by military devotion and the confidences of youth, this new period in their lives required Junot to cloak his personal affections in the mantle of public duty.\n\nAfter his wedding to Laure in 1800, Junot skillfully performed the duties of his position as Commandant of Paris, defending the capital with military order and safeguarding the Consulate with careful diplomacy. In their official capacity, General and Madame Junot hosted dinners and receptions for Napoleon’s officers, ministers, and advisors at their residence on the Champs-Élysées. In this way, Napoleon hoped to keep a close eye on his friends and enemies, military and civilian. The birth of Junot’s first child in 1801 marked a highpoint in the maturity of Jean-Andoche and Napoleon’s new relationship. While Madame Junot was in labor, Commandant Junot sought the support of his old friend:\n\n‘My old friend,’ said [Napoleon] to his faithful and devoted servant, ‘my old friend!’ And then he shook [Junot’s] hand, an excessively rare caress for Napoleon. ‘You have done well to come to me in this moment, and I want to prove it to you’ … Taking the arm of my husband, he continued to converse with him, with a goodness that was so touching, so doubly touching in such a moment, that Junot was moved to tears. No doubt he loved his general, no doubt he loved this great man who commanded admiration: but in such moments, Napoleon’s conduct could conquer the heart … This day riveted, if one can say so, the bonds that tied Junot to Napoleon. (Junot 4: 111–12)\n\nOne might go too far in saying that Napoleon comforted General Junot’s labor pains, but the Emperor’s affection here as an “old friend”—followed by his offer to become the child’s godfather, host the christening at Malmaison, and furnish the young family with a lavish new mansion in Paris—signals Junot’s continued favor with Napoleon and the maturity of their friendship.\n\nLike Duroc, Junot was never promoted to marshal, but this may be because Napoleon placed a higher value on their counsel and diplomacy than their military potential. As head of the imperial palace, Duroc occupied a central position in Napoleon’s household, with many intimate and diplomatic responsibilities. Similarly, Junot’s role as Commandant of Paris placed him in charge of the military defense of the capital and at the center of social life. If Napoleon withheld the marshal’s baton from Duroc and Junot, perhaps it was because he valued their proximity and more urgently required their skills in the drawing room than on the battlefield.\n\nAmid the pressures of his new role as First Consul, Napoleon constantly questioned the public loyalties of even his most devoted friends. Citing several 1801 reports by his notoriously ruthless Minister of Police, Joseph Fouché, that Junot’s wife and mother-in-law had entertained the First Consul’s royalist enemies and pamphleteers, Napoleon confronted Junot: “ ‘Come on, you are a child. Look here. Shut up, dammit! I am not speaking of you, my most faithful friend. Didn’t you prove your attachment when I was in prison? Didn’t you want to follow me to prison?’ ‘I would have followed you to the scaffold!’ Junot cried as he slammed his closed fist on the table” (Junot 4: 67). Confronting the Commandant over his wife’s disloyalty, Napoleon nonetheless acknowledges Junot’s own fidelity and friendship. Resembling a lovers’ quarrel, this confrontation’s emotional theatrics, ardent language, and focus on fidelity reproduces the tropes of romantic passion and foreshadows even worse fits to come.\n\nAs Napoleon’s power increased, so did his fear of betrayal and his constant need to reassess the loyalty of his officers and friends. Following his confrontation with Junot in 1801, Napoleon admitted to him, “ ‘You are a good and loyal boy. You, Lannes, Marmont, Duroc …’ And at each name, Napoleon took a bit of tobacco and walked on, occasionally pausing to smile at a name which reminded him of a faithful servant … ‘Yes, these are good-hearted men who love me; I can count on them’ ” (Junot 4: 68–69). Here, Napoleon confirms his faith in Lannes, Duroc, and Junot and addresses Junot with the familiar tu and toi which, as Laure Junot explains, was a form of address that he reserved only for his closest friends: “I have never heard anyone use the familiar tu with the First Consul. With [Junot], it’s different … Junot was addressed by him in this way until the last year of his life … [I]n private, [Napoleon] always maintained this same cordial rapport with Generals Lannes, Junot, Berthier, Duroc, and two or three others” (4: 77). Echoing other witnesses and memoirists of the Consulate, Laure Junot insists on the loyalty, intimacy, and informality of Napoleon’s small group of friends. But as Napoleon moved closer toward empire, his confidence in even his most loyal generals began to wane.\n\nIn 1802, when the Republican Junot showed only mild support for the plebiscite to elect Napoleon as “Consul for Life,” Napoleon was so furious that Junot became ill, languishing for days until the First Consul forgave him at his bedside. Napoleon’s temper flared again in 1803 when, despite growing tensions between England and France, Junot hesitated to carry out Napoleon’s order to arrest all English subjects in Paris. Knowing that this was a rash and politically unwise decision, Junot advised Napoleon against it and was berated for disloyalty:\n\nAgain! he cried, How’s this? The scene of the other day repeats itself? You and Lannes, you give yourselves too much license. Only the sedate Duroc does not come and preach to me. By God, gentlemen, I will show you another side of me. Lannes has already realized this, and I don’t think he much enjoys eating oranges in Lisbon. As for you, Junot, do not count so much on my friendship. The day I doubt yours, mine will be destroyed. (Junot 4: 407)\n\nThis unsparing tirade stands in contrast to Napoleon’s otherwise intimate friendship with Junot. Laure Junot reports that Napoleon later admitted how much he admired Junot’s honesty and courage in standing up to him and how he regretted his own uncontrollable anger (Junot 4: 409). But on that day in 1803, Napoleon’s harsh words marked the beginning of Junot’s fall from favor.\n\nFollowing Napoleon’s coronation as Emperor in 1804, Junot was relieved of his post as Commandant of Paris and appointed Ambassador to Portugal in 1805. Some have attributed this demotion to Napoleon’s mounting irritation with Laure Junot (who apparently refused, like her widowed mother had done years before, to become Napoleon’s lover), while others cite Junot’s apparent affair with Napoleon’s sister, Caroline Bonaparte Murat (for whom Napoleon had greater ambitions, as the future Queen of Naples). Rather than speculate— as the work of René Girard and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick makes possible—on the triangular (homo)erotics between Andoche, Napoleon, and Laure/Caroline, it would perhaps be more prudent to say that the persistent intimacies of Napoleon and Junot’s personal relationship continued to threaten their public reputation.38 While Junot’s new diplomatic post in Portugal may have seemed an honor, it amounted to virtual exile, far from the elegance of Paris and the intimate presence of Napoleon. Junot would shortly return from Lisbon to take up his place again at Napoleon’s side during the Austerlitz Campaign in 1805, but his initial exile to Portugal presaged a grim Iberian future.\n\nIn 1807, Napoleon again ordered Junot to Lisbon as the head of an invading army whose objective was to occupy Portugal as a staging ground for the future conquest of Spain. But the Iberian Campaign (1807–14) would soon be considered, along with the later Russian Campaign (1812–13) and the battle of Waterloo (1815), as one of Napoleon’s greatest disasters. Bogged down by fierce guerilla fighting, ferocious civilian resistance, and the superior naval power of the English, the protracted campaign in Portugal and Spain soon became a military quagmire. Despite Junot’s successful invasion of Lisbon in 1807, which earned him the title of Duc d’Abrantès, his disastrous capitulation to the English at Vimeiro in 1808 further tarnished his military reputation and favor with Napoleon. Amid the debacle of his military blunders in Portugal, Junot wrote desperate letters to the Emperor, asking to be reappointed Napoleon’s aide-decamp, expressing his continued love and devotion, and begging Napoleon to remember the affections of their youth. Although these letters have not survived, Napoleon’s documented descriptions of the letters characterize them as material for epistolary melodrama.\n\nIn Paris in 1808, Napoleon confronted Laure Junot, now the Duchesse d’Abrantès, with General Junot’s letters: “ ‘Look here, Madame, what your husband writes to me!’ said the Emperor, ‘Read this and tell me if he sends you such letters.’ I read these letters, and this caused me some pain: my husband sent me affectionate missives, but never in the tone of a lover; here were letters that resembled those between Julie and Saint-Preux, or those of the Portuguese nun” (Junot 8: 45). These comparisons of General Junot’s letters with Guilleragues’s Portuguese Letters (1669) and Rousseau’s Julie or the New Héloïse (1761) imply that Junot’s devotion to the Emperor burned like that of a lover in a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century epistolary novel.39 Having written his own such novel,Clisson et Eugénie (1795), Napoleon was well aware of the tropes associated with such literary passions. After showing Madame Junot her husband’s letters, Napoleon declared “Well then! It’s like a novel!” (Junot 8: 49). Junot is thus compared to Guilleragues’s lovesick letter-writing nun, languishing in faraway Portugal for his French military lover Napoleon. Hurt and embarrassed that her own letters from Junot lack such ardor, Laure Junot is forced to acknowledge that Napoleon is a rival for her husband’s affections.\n\nAs the confrontation between the Emperor and the Duchess continues, Napoleon wonders aloud—like an incredulous lover—if General Junot’s passionate words and flattery represent mere self-interest: “In admitting that Junot loves me more than anything in the world … [he demonstrates] that he does not love me more than his own ambition” (Junot 8: 48). While venting his doubts over Junot’s love, Napoleon underscores the fact that Junot loves him even more than his own wife. Devastated, Laure Junot is forced to admit publicly that Junot loves Napoleon even more than herself and their children: “He loves you, Sire, more than all the honors that you can give, more than your crown, more than me perhaps, for it was pride that made me say the contrary just now, perhaps even more than his children!” (8: 48–49). While Laure Junot may exaggerate her husband’s affections for Napoleon in order to safeguard her own favor and position, this is nonetheless a humiliating admission. According to this account, General Junot’s Portuguese letter exemplifies the total loyalty required of Napoleon’s officers and friends. But the degree to which Junot’s letter expresses his continued affection for Napoleon seems to have been a source of embarrassment for both his wife and the Emperor.\n\nLetter from Russia (1812)\n\nEven as he naively hoped to please his beloved Napoleon, Junot’s Portuguese debacle (1808) and later failures in Spain (1810–11) were a prelude to his disappointing performance during the disastrous Russian Campaign (1812–13). Junot was not, of course, entirely responsible for Napoleon’s enormous losses at Borodino, the Russians’ burning of Moscow, the early onset of the merciless Russian winter, and the devastating loss of over half a million soldiers through combat, capture, desertion, and exposure.40 Yet in December 1812, during the Grande Armée’s calamitous retreat from Moscow, Napoleon publicly denounced Junot in the Bulletins of the Grande Armée, which reported back to all of France how Junot’s incompetence had cost Napoleon a decisive battle at Smolensk.41 Echoing the thirteenth and fourteenth bulletins, which claimed that Junot had failed to “intercept the main route to Moscow and block the [Russian] retreat” (61),\n\nNapoleon later declared that “Junot, in the Russian Campaign … greatly displeased me; one no longer recognized him; he made vital mistakes that cost us dearly.”42 Having never received the order to attack, Junot argued that his hesitation at Smolensk was due to a gross lack of communication: “The bulletin, which speaks of the army’s march on Smolensk, says that I lost my way and made a bad tactical move. Sire, I did not at all lose my way… I NEVER RECEIVED ANY ORDER TO ATTACK” (Junot 10: 316). Junot’s emphasis in this letter demonstrates his rage, shame, and pain at such an unwarranted and public denunciation.\n\nYet again, Junot was confronted with the irreconcilable conflict between his public and private relationships with Napoleon. According to Laure Junot, Jean-Andoche passionately loved the man, not the emperor, and could never reconcile Napoleon’s inability to love him as the young Bonaparte did when they first met in Toulon: “Now let me explain the sadness and pain which afflicted Junot on learning that Napoleon was no longer his General Bonaparte of Toulon. Perhaps the affair simply followed a natural decline. But Junot … did not see it this way. He wanted reciprocity, which he craved even more as his own affectionate fantasies increased … He loved the MAN, not the emperor” (10: 312–13). Junot seems to have forgotten that Napoleon was first attracted to him in 1793 Toulon because of his courage and skill in combat. By disappointing Napoleon with his later military blunders in Portugal and Russia, Junot sabotaged the original terms of their seduction. As all of his intimate friendships attest, Napoleon was attracted to men of superior military ability. Once Junot began to falter on the battlefield, the seduction for Napoleon was over. While Junot loved the man, Napoleon only loved the soldier.\n\nWhether Junot’s lapse in military judgment at Smolensk was the fault of error, miscommunication, or the cumulative effects of his repeated head injuries and cerebral trauma, Napoleon’s public denunciation of his old friend in the Bulletins of the Grande Arméehelped the Emperor to cover his own embarrassing tracks in the Russian snow.43 In a repeat performance of his early Egyptian withdrawal in 1799, Napoleon abandoned his decimated army in Russia in December 1812 on the pretext that he needed to return to Paris and reestablish his authority at home, following the attempted October military coup of General Claude-François de Malet. On the eve of his return to a politically destabilized France, Napoleon thus needed expedient scapegoats like Junot to explain the overwhelming losses of his soldiers and the colossal failure of the Russian Campaign. In deserting the Grande Armée in Russia, Napoleon also abandoned almost twenty years of friendship with Junot, along with the hundreds of thousands of frozen cadavers that littered the snow-covered route of the army’s long and arduous retreat.\n\nWhile still in Russia, Junot responded to this public denunciation with a late 1812 letter to Napoleon, arguing that he was hurt more by this personal betrayal than by the public humiliation it created: “Two Bulletins condemned me, Sire, and I did not complain. Public opinion is not what is dearest to me; your Majesty’s opinion is the thing which I value more than life itself” (Junot 10: 315). For Napoleon, the Russian defeat in 1812–13 marked the beginning of the disastrous road leading to his first abdication and exile to Elba in 1814, and to his later defeat at Waterloo and final exile to St. Helena in 1815. For Junot, the Russian debacle represented both the public humiliation of the Bulletins and the personal loss of his cherished friendship with Bonaparte. Convinced that “Napoleon no longer loves me” (Junot 10: 315), General Junot returned to France disillusioned and disconsolate.\n\nLetter from Illyria (1813)\n\nIn 1813, Napoleon relieved the forty-two-year-old general from active military duty and dispatched him to eastern Europe, to serve as the French Governor of the Illyrian Provinces, a group of Balkan territories on the eastern shores of the Adriatic Sea, which had been ceded by the Austrians following the French victory at Wagram in 1809 and incorporated into the French Empire.44 Far from Paris, the company of Napoleon, and the battlefields of the ensuing Saxon Campaign in 1813, this new diplomatic assignment—like Junot’s ambassadorship to Portugal in 1805—amounted to another virtual exile. Unwilling to join her husband in this unfashionable and distant outpost of the French Empire, far from the salons of Paris and her new young lover Maurice de Balincourt, Laure Junot remained in France along with the Junots’ four children.45\n\nAfter a month of languishing alone in this remote colony, where the degenerative effects of his head wounds gave way to increasingly erratic behavior, Governor Junot hosted a lavish ball for four hundred invited guests, drawn from the imperial nobility, his ambassadorial staff, and numerous local dignitaries. Flanked by the city of Trieste in the Italian north and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) in the Croatian south, the capital of the Illyrian Provinces was located in the Slovenian city of Ljubljana. Here, Junot’s French imperial administration occupied a sumptuous Governor’s palace, whose grand ballroom was furnished with glittering chandeliers and an elegant marble staircase. As the former Commandant of Paris and Ambassador to Portugal, Governor Junot was an experienced diplomat and host who was accustomed, on formal occasions, to wearing the many distinguished ribbons and medals that befit his rank as a French imperial ambassador, commandant, governor, and duke, as well as a decorated general of the Grande Armée and officer of the Légion d’Honneur. Not one to question protocol, Junot diplomatically and dutifully adorned himself with all of the many colorful decorations that attested not only to his own personal accomplishments but to the glory of the French Empire. His head held high, his sword at his side, and his epaulettes squared gallantly on his shoulders, Junot entered the Illyrian ballroom that evening in 1813 wearing all of—and nothing but—his many medals which, Junot’s scandalized guests immediately realized, were not the only things dangling from the general’s bare and battle-ravaged body.46\n\nWhile one could blame Junot’s naked diplomacy on his progressive dementia, his shocking entrance can also be seen as a kind of buff rebuff to Napoleon. After a lifetime fighting for Bonaparte, watching shrapnel rip into young men’s bodies, leading thousands of soldiers to their deaths, and suffering twenty-seven wounds of his own, Junot offered his own ravaged body as a hideous and spectacular product of Napoleon’s violence.47 Like the Roman general Coriolanus exposing his battle-wounds to the citizens of Rome, Junot presented his scars alongside his medals, exposing these marks of mutilation to his Illyrian guests as his most genuine decorations, painfully acquired in the service of Napoleon’s voracious and insatiable ambition. In this ballsy ballroom display, Junot presented his disfigured body as bitter proof of his lifelong devotion to a man whom he once loved, for whom he frequently risked his life, and who in the end possessed neither the gratitude nor compassion to promote him to marshal, provide for his convalescence, or offer a comfortable retirement. In many ways, the scarred body that astonished the Illyrian ladies that evening was the body of a battered lover who had sacrificed his youth and vitality to a violent and abusive man. In addition to embodying his private suffering, Junot’s battle wounds also symbolized the public ravages of Napoleonic warfare on a grand scale. Like a worn map of French Imperial Europe, this body’s multiple scarlines represented the violent rewriting of national borders. And Junot’s cerebral trauma symbolized the degenerative effects of rampant Napoleonic madness.\n\nLike the Emperor, Las Cases attributed Junot’s behavior in Illyria to “complete insanity” and the “signs of dementia which only worsened on his return to France, during which, having mutilated himself in a horrible way, he soon perished, the victim of excesses which had altered his sanity and his reason” (361–62). Junot’s final letter to Napoleon in 1813, however, shows no signs of insanity or dementia.48 Rather, this letter seethes with the fatigue and regret of a man who dedicated his life to a thankless emperor and an ungrateful friend:\n\nThis eternal war that we must fight for you, I WANT NO MORE OF IT! I WANT PEACE! I want finally to repose my tired head, my sore limbs … to enjoy that which I earned … with my BLOOD! The blood of an honest man, of a good Frenchman, of a true patriot. I therefore ask, at last, for that tranquility that I earned through twenty-two years of effective service and seventeen wounds from which my blood has flowed for my country, and for your glory. (Junot 11: 207)\n\nEchoing Marshal Lannes’s alleged deathbed dissent, Junot reproaches Napoleon for his never-ending wars. Evoking the naked honesty of the Illyrian ballroom, Junot once again offers his ravaged body—his “tired head,” “sore limbs,” and spilled “blood”—as physical proof of his lifelong loyalty and as shameful signs of Napoleonic abuse. In these last words to his friend, Junot juxtaposes his lifetime commitment to Napoleon with his final disillusionment, rage, and regret, feelings that run even deeper than the rust of shrapnel on the brain.\n\nThat Junot was so cruelly abandoned by a man—if we are to believe Laure Junot—whom he loved even more than his wife and children, leaves little question as to why, on being relieved of his Illyrian post in 1813, Junot returned to his family home in Burgundy, threw himself from a window, and subsequently died of his wounds. More than what Las Cases refers to euphemistically as self-mutilation, Junot seems to have taken his own life in an act of suicidal despair. On hearing news of Junot’s death, Napoleon did not weep.49 Instead, he ordered General Savary, Fouché’s successor as Minister of Police, to forcibly search Junot’s home and to seize and burn his letters. Thus ended what for Napoleon must have been an embarrassing epistolary romance, but what for Junot had been his life’s best purpose.\n\nAS THREE OF the most visible figures of Napoleonic friendship— whose lives and deaths were widely celebrated and scrutinized in army bulletins, imperial memoirs, and around bivouac camp fires—Lannes, Duroc, and Junot stood out as models of both Napoleon’s affection for his soldiers and their fanatical devotion to him. In turn, these models of Napoleonic friendship at the top influenced social relations among soldiers in the lower ranks. While Bonaparte and his senior officers emerged from an older generation of soldiers who had joined the Royal Army during the Ancien Régime and came of age in the armies of the Revolution, thousands of Napoleon’s junior officers and foot soldiers hailed from a younger generation of conscripts who first entered Napo-leon’s armies during the Consulate and the Empire. In their fierce devotion to the Emperor and their belief in his devotion to them, this new generation perpetuated the terms of Revolutionary fraternity and Napoleonic friendship exemplified by Lannes, Duroc, and Junot.\n\nNapoleon directly expressed his affection for this new generation through the many field promotions he made to both officers and soldiers who exemplified themselves in battle. More than mere appreciation or praise, these field promotions were often marked by moments of genuine affection between the Emperor and his troops, who later spoke fondly of Napoleon’s penchant for pinching the ears of well-regarded soldiers or his habit of pinning his own cross of the Légion d’Honneur onto a well-deserving warrior. Even though many of these promotions were arbitrarily distributed, this practice strengthened morale and wildly increased Napoleon’s popularity among his men. In his memoirs, General Jean-Pierre Pouget cites a characteristic episode in which a soldier, aptly named Bayonette, is honored by the Emperor on an Austrian battlefield in 1809: “You are the bravest soldier of the regiment. I name you a knight of the Légion d’Honneur, and I add to the title a pension of fifteen hundred francs that you can leave to your children.”50Despite the seemingly haphazard distribution of these promotions, they represented an extraordinary chance for many soldiers, conscripted from the abject poverty and limited opportunities of the peasantry, to become officers and ennobled knights and thus obtain financial security for themselves and their families.51\n\nThis interest in the welfare of his soldiers had led Napoleon to create the Légion d’Honneur in 1802 and its system of military pensions for veterans, widows, and orphans. In his memoirs, Captain Elzéar Blaze explains that, for a soldier of the Grande Armée, advancement was everything: “The word advancement lodges in the military brain from the moment one enters into service. It does not leave until the day one retires… This idea preoccupied everyone in the army, from the drummer boy to the marshal.”52 Since Napoleon had come of age in the meritocratic armies of the Revolution and had rapidly gained promotion in this same way, he understood the fierce thirst for advancement and encouraged this ambition among the soldiers of his Grande Armée. Napoleon thus demonstrated a kind of meritocratic affection for his soldiers through an interest in their promotion and welfare.\n\nMany soldiers thus believed that Napoleon loved them as a fellow soldier: awarding them as he had been awarded, eating scavenged potatoes as they did, fighting alongside them in the mud and misery of combat. Captain Blaze argues that Napoleon’s willingness to share both their suffering and rewards was what distinguished the Grande Armée from the old Royal Army of the Ancien Régime: “One often saw the Emperor detach his own Légion d’Honneur cross and place it on the chest of a brave soldier. Louis XIV would have first asked if the brave man was noble; Napoleon asked if this noble man was brave … While Napoleon would have embraced the sergeant, Louis XIV would have turned his back on him. This is the clearly divided nuance that separated the two periods.”53 In the eyes of his soldiers, Napoleon was—unlike an indifferent king who remained at court while his men died in combat—a fellow soldier who loved them with the kind of meritocratic respect of one warrior for another.\n\nRecalling Junot’s fanatical devotion to Napoleon, there are reports of soldiers who, at least in the beginning of their service, spoke of their great love and dedication to the Emperor. While some sources exaggerate the magnitude of Napoleonic devotion, there are cases where Junot’s fanaticism seems neither extreme nor unique.54 On the return of Napoleon from Elba in 1815, an enthusiastic young officer named Lieutenant Anciaume writes, “Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! I am at the height of happiness. I am crazy with love and joy. I have found again my Emperor.”55 Even more extraordinary is the reaction of Jean Bordenave who passionately writes to the Minister of War, “My heart was as empty as a lover who has lost the object of his passion; all that he sees, all that he hears renews his pain … But now I am like a lover who has rediscovered his desire; I offer my body to support His Majesty. Long live the Emperor!”56 Bordenave’s strikingly erotic discourse dramatizes the passionate and fanatical devotion of many soldiers to Napoleon.\n\nIf Lannes, Duroc, and Junot served as ideal models of Napoleon’s love for his men and their love for him, Lannes’s and Junot’s final disillusionment with the Emperor also found ample voice in the lower ranks of the Grande Armée. Napoleon’s desertion of his armies in 1799 Egypt and 1812 Russia led to widespread disappointment that he did not in fact love his men and to increasing reports that they did not love him. Oaths of loyalty to the Emperor soon gave way to talk of the ogre, who laid waste to entire generations of men in order to feed his insatiable ambition. In his memoirs, General Alfred-Armand-Robert de Saint-Chamans reports that in the aftermath of the bloody massacre at Eylau in 1807, the once loyal cries of Napoleon’s troops had turned to mutinous calls for bread and an end to the Emperor’s never-ending wars: “In the middle of cries of Long live the Emperor! I heard many soldiers cry Long live Peace! and others Long live Peace and France! [and] still others cried Bread and Peace!”57\n\nIt was perhaps in this spirit of misery and complaint that the term grognard or “grumbler” came to signify the Napoleonic foot soldier or grunt. These cries for bread and peace soon became more vehement, as Napoleon’s grognards grew tired of the Emperor’s empty promises. In his memoirs, Captain Jérôme-Roland Laugier complains that “[w]e no longer fight for peace, as [Napoleon] had promised, but for [his] excessive ambition, which used to impress a great number of superior officers and soldiers, but which the majority of men no longer support.”58 As Laugier makes clear, the army’s growing disillusionment with Napoleon marked the difference between the glorious beginning of the Napoleonic Wars and the onset of the disastrous end.\n\nIn the memoirs of those who survived, the junior officers and foot soldiers of the Grande Armée express how fraternity and friendship took on a new and more intimate significance on the battlefield. As Captain Blaze explains, “This fraternity of peril had strengthened friendship for some and created new friendships for others. Friendship that forms on the field of battle is one of lasting duration” (43). For many, the hardships of life in Napoleon’s armies would necessitate such friendships, not only for communal comfort but also for mutual survival. As General Marcellin de Marbot, Captain Jean-Roch Coignet, and Sergeant François Bourgogne attest in their military memoirs, their survival during the disastrous Russian Campaign in 1812–13 depended on the help of fellow soldiers and the affectionate care of Napoleonic friendship in the ranks."
