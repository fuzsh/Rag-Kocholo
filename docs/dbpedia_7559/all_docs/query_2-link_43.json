        "text": "Well, you know I just have to jump in here... In the first place, this little blurb is entirely too over the top regarding fidelity and loyalty. Of course, Lannes was loyal to Naps, but that never stopped him from being critical, often in public, nor did it blind him to Nap's various shortcomings. I can tell you that during the Egyptian Campaign, he was most vocal about the idiocy of being there in the first place, and that sentiment grew stronger before, during, and after the abortive siege of Saint-Jean-d'Acre. Lannes absolutely positively did NOT defeat Bennigsen at Pultusk. At all. He managed to hold his position against superior Russian numbers and was rescued by Daultanne's troops from Davout's III corps during the onset of a blizzard. Meanwhile, Bennigsen withdrew in white-out conditions. Naps tried to write this off as a victory, but Lannes never did. As to how he would have managed in peacetime, I know he did rather well in the year after Friedland in June 1807 until leaving for Spain in November 1808. Even then he didn't stay in one place--traveling between his overly ostentatious country house in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, formerly the property of Louis XVI's brother d'Artois, and his hometown. But it was Spain that changed everything, in particular, the siege of Zaragoza. It was all downhill after that--only a bit over three months left."
