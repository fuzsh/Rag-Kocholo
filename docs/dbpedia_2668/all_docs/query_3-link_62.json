        "text": "Devon A Clark passed peacefully from this life on January 15, 2024 in Layton, Utah at age 72. He had been battling health challenges for the past five years.\n\nDevon was born April 14, 1951 in Coalville, Summit, Utah to Albion Willard and Josephine Clark. He was the third of ten children.\n\nIn his younger years Devon worked for the Union Pacific Railroad, was a truck driver, and spent his final working years at Echo State Park. He loved the outdoors. Deer hunting and fishing were favorite activities, especially when he could go to his Grandpa & Grandma Clark’s ranch in Chalk Creek.\n\nDevon loved his family. His longtime relationship with his sweetheart, Joyce May Blair Patton provided him his son, Clifford, and stepchildren Linda Anderson, Billy Clark, Connie Mitchell, Ronnie Clark, Hope Patton, and 17 grandchildren.\n\nDevon was preceded in death by Joyce, his parents and seven siblings. He is survived by his children and grandchildren, two brothers, Mark (Diane) Clark, Henderson Nevada; and Billy Clark, Price, Utah; cousins, and extended family that love him.\n\nA special thank you is extended to all of Devon’s friends and caretakers, especially those at Apple Village Assisted Living.\n\nA graveside memorial will be held for Devon in the spring at the Upton, Utah Cemetery."
