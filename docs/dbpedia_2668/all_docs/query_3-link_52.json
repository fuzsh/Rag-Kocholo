        "text": "The population passed 57,000\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of West Devon increased by 6.6%, from just under 53,600 in 2011 to around 57,100 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased by a smaller percentage than the overall population of the South West (7.8%), but at a similar rate to the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, West Devon was home to around 0.4 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 0.3 in 2011. This area was the least densely populated local authority area across the South West.\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was lower in West Devon than across the South West\n\nPercentage population change, West Devon and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% South West ▲7.8% West Devon ▲6.6% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nAn older West Devon\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of West Devon increased by four years, from 47 to 51 years of age.\n\nThis area had the joint highest average (median) age in the South West (alongside Dorset , South Hams and Torridge ) and a higher average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 65 to 74 years rose by just over 1,900 (an increase of 29.0%), while the number of residents between 35 and 49 years fell by just under 1,700 (15.8% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 65 and 74 years increased by 2.6 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nDisability in West Devon\n\nThe age-standardised proportion of non-disabled residents fell in West Devon, but rose across England.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn West Devon, the proportion of non-disabled residents fell from 82.0% in 2011 to 81.1% in 2021, while across England it rose from 80.7% to 82.3%. During the same period, the regional proportion increased from 81.9% to 82.2%.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in West Devon fell from 7.6% to 7.3%, while the percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a little increased from 10.4% to 11.6%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of non-disabled residents in West Devon decreased by 0.9 percentage points\n\nWest Devon stood out from other areas for housing\n\nThe percentage of households in the social rented sector increased here, but fell across England.\n\nIn West Devon, the percentage of households in the social rented sector rose from 9.5% in 2011 to 10.1% in 2021, while across England it fell from 17.7% to 17.1%. During the same period, the regional percentage remained at 13.3%.\n\nPrivate renting in West Devon increased from 15.0% to 18.2%, while the rate of home ownership decreased from 73.2% to 71.0%.\n\nThe rate of social renting in West Devon increased by 0.6 percentage points\n\nFewer couples with dependent children\n\nWest Devon saw the South West's second-largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of households including a couple with dependent children (from 18.3% in 2011 to 16.1% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Forest of Dean saw a greater fall in the percentage of households including a couple with dependent children (from 19.7% to 17.2%).\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with dependent children in West Devon decreased by 2.2 percentage points\n\nChanging relationships in West Devon\n\nWest Devon saw the South West's second-largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership (from 9.6% in 2011 to 10.5% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Dorset saw a greater rise in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership (from 9.8% to 10.8%).\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership in West Devon increased by 0.9 percentage points\n\nChange in employment\n\nWest Devon saw the South West's second-largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed (from 55.4% in 2011 to 51.5% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Isles of Scilly saw a greater fall in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed (from 72.1% to 63.7%).\n\nBecause of its small size, comparisons to Isles of Scilly should be made with caution.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) in West Devon decreased by 3.9 percentage points\n\nFewer adults working long hours\n\nWest Devon saw the South West's second-largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week (from 18.0% in 2011 to 14.5% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Wiltshire saw a greater fall in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week (from 15.8% to 12.2%).\n\nEvery local authority area across the South West saw a fall in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week, as the regional percentage fell from 13.3% to 10.8%.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in West Devon decreased by 3.5 percentage points\n\nHealth in West Devon\n\nIn 2021, 49.6% of West Devon residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 48.4% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 34.1% to 33.4%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of West Devon residents describing their health as \"very bad\" was 1.0% (similar to 2011), while those describing their health as \"bad\" remained 3.6%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in very good health in West Devon increased by 1.2 percentage points\n\nWest Devon residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 52,400 West Devon residents said they were born in England. This represented 91.7% of the local population. The figure has risen from around 49,300 in 2011, which at the time represented 92.0% of West Devon's population.\n\nScotland was the next most represented, with just over 700 West Devon residents reporting this country of birth (1.2%). This figure was down from around 750 in 2011, which at the time represented 1.4% of the population of West Devon.\n\nThe number of West Devon residents born in Wales fell from around 750 in 2011 (1.4% of the local population) to just under 700 in 2021 (1.2%).\n\nIn 2021, 91.7% of West Devon residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nUnpaid care in West Devon\n\nIn 2021, 5.2% of West Devon residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 7.9% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just under 1 in 50 people (1.7%) reported providing between 20 and 49 hours of unpaid care each week, compared with 1.3% in 2011. The proportion of West Devon residents (aged five years and over) that provided at least 50 hours of weekly unpaid care increased from 2.5% to 2.8%.\n\nThis area had the region’s third highest proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care. Across the region, only Isles of Scilly (5.6%) and South Hams (5.3%) had a higher proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in West Devon decreased by 2.7 percentage points\n\nReligion in West Devon\n\nIn 2021, 41.6% of West Devon residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 26.6% in 2011. The rise of 15.0 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in West Devon. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 29.3% to 44.1%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 50.3% of people in West Devon described themselves as Christian (down from 63.6%), while 6.5% did not state their religion (down from 8.5% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 41.6% of usual residents in West Devon reported having \"No religion\"\n\nEthnic groups in West Devon\n\nIn 2021, 1.1% of West Devon residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category, up from 0.8% in 2011. The 0.3 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of people from \"Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups\" increased from 1.4% to 2.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 2.3% to 3.0%.\n\nIn 2021, 97.8% of people in West Devon identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 98.5% in 2011), while 0.6% identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category (also 0.6% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Other\" category (\"Arab\" or \"Any other ethnic group\") increased from 0.1% in 2011 to 0.3% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 1.1% of usual residents in West Devon identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category\n\nNational identity in West Devon\n\nIn 2021, 3.0% of West Devon residents did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK. This figure increased from 2.2% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, 1.2% of residents identified with a UK and non-UK national identity, compared with 0.4% in 2011. The percentage of residents in West Devon that identified as \"British only\" increased from 16.7% to 57.1%.\n\nThis area had the region’s joint third lowest percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK (alongside Forest of Dean). Across the region, only Torridge (2.1%) and Teignbridge (2.8%) had a lower percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in West Devon increased by 0.8 percentage points\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales. The articles have been written and semi-automated by our data journalists and are a new publishing format for the Office for National Statistics.\n\nTopics are chosen and ordered automatically based on how relevant they are for each area, however all data are checked before publishing.\n\nWe have not included topics that were new for Census 2021 or where there is no comparability with the 2011 Census. Read about how we developed and tested the questions for Census 2021.\n\nThese articles were first published on 8 December 2022 covering topics such as demography, country of birth, ethnic groups, religion, national identity and economic activity status. They were updated on 19 January 2023 following the release of more data from Census 2021 and now include housing tenure, general health, disability and unpaid care.\n\nRelated links\n\nContact\n\ncensus.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\nTelephone: +44 1329 44 4972"
