        "text": "Summary\n\nOil painting on canvas, View of Whiteway House by William Tomkins (London c.1730 â€“ London 1792), circa 1771. Whiteway, near Chudleigh, was built by John Parker, later 1st Lord Boringdon, and completed about 1771. It was probably bought by, or may have been settled on, his younger brother Montagu Edmund Parker, whose descendants continued in possession until this century. In the meantime the two branches of the family had become reunited by the marriage of Edmund Parker, 2nd Earl of Morley, with his second cousin Harriet Coryton, who was born a Parker of Whiteway. In the early 1920's Edmund Robert Parker, 4th Earl of Morley sold Whiteway to the Farquhar family, who still live there."
