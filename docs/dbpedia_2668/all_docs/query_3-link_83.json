        "text": "My Story\n\nI have been a full-time birth doula for over nine years. Over sixteen years ago, I became a stay at home mom of two daughters, dogs, cats, a small flock of backyard chickens, & gardens. Both of our girls were born at the Women’s Birth and Wellness Center in Chapel Hill, NC with much of each labor spent at our home, nestled in the woods. I was surrounded by supportive, nurturing family and friend(s) for each birth and feel blessed to have had such powerful, beautiful experiences.\n\nThough both births were extraordinary rite of passages in their own way, I have always wished that we had hired a Doula for the birth of our first child. I had done so much reading, researching, attending of birth classes, and was going to be working with midwives & have my husband, mother, sister, & friend there, so I assumed that I didn’t “need” a Doula. I now believe that my experience could have been enhanced (shorter, less exhausting, shortened pushing time) by hiring a Doula, someone who KNEW birth & its stages & had lots of tricks up her sleeve to get things moving! I had a Doula with me for the birth of my second daughter & have always been grateful for her presence, knowledge, & support- both physical & emotional.\n\nMy Training\n\nIn December 2013, I trained to be a Birth Doula through DONA International. I feel a profound calling to work with women/ birthing people & their partners, to create a dialogue leading to informed, thoughtful choices in their childbirth experience. I wish to support you in exploring your unique path on your journey into parenthood. We will use evidence based information to explore your childbirth options, & create your birth preferences/plan before labor begins so you feel empowered during the labor process.\n\nI have attended many births in various settings in the NC Triangle:\n\nUNC Hospital\n\nDuke Regional\n\nDuke University Hospital\n\nWakeMed Cary\n\nWakeMed Raleigh\n\nWakeMed North\n\nRex\n\nChatham Hospital UNC, Siler City\n\nCentral Carolina Community Hospital, Sanford\n\nMoses Cone Hospital\n\nWomen’s Birth & Wellness Center (now closed)\n\nBaby+Co (now closed)\n\nMidwife-Attended Homebirth\n\nI have experience working with people who have given birth:\n\nWithout medicine\n\nUsing Nitrous Oxide, IV pain meds, and Epidural pain relief\n\nWith Pitocin for augmentation, & induction\n\nBy Cesarean Section\n\nTo twins vaginally, & via planned cesarean\n\nIn a Birth Tub (water birth)\n\nAs a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC)\n\nUsing a TENS Unit for pain management\n\nWhile being treated for preeclampsia, hypertension, gestational diabetes, low platelets, & other health challenges\n\nPrecipitously (extremely rapid labor)\n\nI have attended many professional trainings to continue my education in the art of birth doula work, and to enhance my techniques:\n\nDONA International Birth Doula Training\n\nB.E.S.T. Birth (Birth Emergency Skills Training)\n\nPrenatal Yoga Certification\n\nRebozo scarf techniques\n\nSpinning Babies techniques\n\nWhen Survivors Give Birth (this link gives the idea of what we covered in the training)\n\nEvidence Based Birth online study course (currently studying- not yet completed). My clients have access to the published articles!\n\nTENS Unit training, & have units for rent\n\nNext Steps…"
