        "text": "The HALIFAX MEMORIAL in Nova Scotia's capital, erected in Point Pleasant Park, is one of the few tangible reminders of the men who died at sea. Twenty-four ships were lost by the Royal Canadian Navy in the Second World War and nearly 2,000 members of the RCN lost their lives. This Memorial was erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and was unveiled in November 1967 with naval ceremony by H.P. MacKeen, Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, in the presence of R. Teillet, then Minister of Veterans Affairs. The monument is a great granite Cross of Sacrifice over 12 metres high, clearly visible to all ships approaching Halifax. The cross is mounted on a large podium bearing 23 bronze panels upon which are inscribed the names of over 3,000 Canadian men and women who were buried at sea. The dedicatory inscription, in French and English, reads as follows:\n\n1914-1939\n\n1918-1945\n\nIN THE HONOUR OF\n\nTHE MEN AND WOMEN\n\nOF THE NAVY\n\nARMY AND MERCHANT NAVY\n\nOF CANADA\n\nWHOSE NAMES\n\nARE INSCRIBED HERE\n\nTHEIR GRAVES ARE UNKNOWN\n\nBUT THEIR MEMORY\n\nSHALL ENDURE.\n\nOn June 19, 2003, the Government of Canada designated September 3rd of each year as a day to acknowledge the contribution of Merchant Navy Veterans."
