        "text": "A Devon zoo has announced the arrival of new additions to its collection of Carpathian lynx.\n\nA Dartmoor Zoo spokesperson said they were \"elated\" at the birth of two kits after Emily, who travelled from Germany in February, was introduced to long-term resident Flaviu.\n\nThe zoo said after the successful introduction on 19 March, the pair became \"inseparable\" and have now become parents.\n\nIt said it was able confirm the births on 29 May after \"squeaks\" were heard in the cubbing den with their mother, with initial sightings as they started to explore.\n\nThe zoo also said Emily seemed \"calm and in good spirits\" while Flaviu was \"already showing signs of protection and attentiveness towards Emily and their litter\".\n\nFlaviu hit the news in 2016 when he went missing from the zoo, causing it to temporarily close before he was found.\n\nAnimal manager Madeleine Millin said the keeper team will be monitoring the family to allow the kits to adjust, explore and feel safe and calm in their environment.\n\nCEO David Gibson said they were \"absolutely thrilled\" by the new additions.\n\n\"This species is under severe threat across much of its home range in central Europe, so every captive born individual is extremely important for the future survival of the species,\" said Mr Gibson.\n\nThe zoo explained Emily and Flaviu were a subspecies of Eurasian Lynx, the largest of the four species of the animal.\n\nIt added the majority of this species could be found in Romania, Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine, whilst the population in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria was \"scattered\".\n\n\"With a population of around 2100 â€“ 2400, breeding and reintroduction programmes within zoos are essential to stabilising and subsequently increasing these numbers,\" the zoo said.\n\n\"To announce that our breeding match has been successful is a great achievement.\""
