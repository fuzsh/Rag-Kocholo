        "text": "John Brown JP (1582-1659) 24\n\nAncestry: 10\n\nHis father was Sir John BROWNE (1558 - 1627 ) of Frampton a renowned Rear Admiral who helped Elizabeth defeat the Spanish Armada and was knighted on 23 July 1603 in the Royal Garden at Whitehall before the King James Coronation22. He was educated at Exeter College Oxford 9 where he had matriculated on 3 Dec 1575 at the age of 16. He became a student of the Middle Temple and practiced as a JP with Sir Arthur Ashley as he is mentioned in his casebook from 1614.12 The biographical notes done by Thomas D Murphy in William Whiteway�s diary 7 says he was elected High Sheriff for Dorset in 1588; 1616 and 1618 and became Deputy Lieutenant 1625-26. His death is also recorded in William Whiteway�s diary as �This month there died near us (i.e. in Dorchester) Sir John Browne 10th October 1627�. He was buried in Frampton and the picture is of the table tomb for him and his wife Jane and rests on the North side of the chancel in St Mary�s church. Sir John is wearing tilting Armour and through his visor his moustache is visible. Probate of his will was granted 24th November 16271.\n\nHis mother was Jane the daughter of Sir Henry PORTMAN of Orchard in Somerset. Jane married his father in Orchard on the 18th July 1579 and John their first male child was born at Frampton in 1582. He had two surviving younger brothers George born 1583 and Robert born in 1588. Jane died at Frampton on 11th7 & was buried there on 20 May 1634.\n\nHis brother George BROWNE (1583 - 1631 ) went to Magdelen College Oxford9 in 1598 but moved to University College where he was awarded his BA in 1602. He became a Barrister-at-Law at the Middle Temple in 1609, was MP for Lyme Regis in 1614, and Lent Reader 1628. He died 22 March 1630/317 in Taunton Somerset 14\n\nHis brother Robert BROWNE ( 1588 - 1648) was also educated at Oxford�s Magdelen College9 which he entered 14 May 1602 at the age of 14 and was awarded his BA on 24 April 1605. He entered the Middle Temple in 1615 and like both his brothers became a Barrister-at-Law. He was also MP for Bridport for the year 1624/515 . Robert Browne features in the Court of Chivalry case BROWNE V SEARLE showing that Robert was alive in 1639.�He was then of Taunton Castle and is referred to as son of Sir John Browne of Frampton. He appears to have died there leaving a will for which probate was granted on 12 June 1648.\n\nSt Mary's Church Frampton\n\nSt Mary’s church at Frampton dates from 1460/80 but the tower was re-built in 1695 and the south porch added in 1820 before a major restoration in 1862.\n\nInside however there are a few surviving monuments.\n\nJohn BROWNE was born on the family estate in Frampton which is a small parish situated on the River Frome, 5� miles north west from Dorchester on the Crewkerne road. Frampton is mentioned in the Domesday Book and at one time there was a priory here. After the Dissolution the lands were passed to the Browne family who remained lords of the manor until 1833, it then passed to the Sheridans. The principal residence for many years was Frampton Court which was demolished in 1932 after the estate was sold to pay death duties. Although there has probably been a church here since Saxon time, the present church of St Mary's dates from the 14th century but has experienced many rebuildings and additions. As far as we know the children were baptised here but the parish registers only start from 1627.16\n\nOn 13th October 1598 John BROWNE and his younger brother George entered Magdelen College Oxford 9 together, John being aged 16 and his brother 15; John became a student of the Middle Temple in 1599 and went on to be a practicing Barrister-at-Law. He sat regularly between 1625 and 1638 as a Justice of the Peace in Dorset at the Quarter sessions often with his fathers friend Sir Francis Ashley , but with other JP�s who had invested in the Dorchester Company like Sir Richard Strode and Sir Walter Erle. The Quarter Sessions were held in rotation at Beaminster; Blandford Forum; Dorchester; Sherborne and Bridport and he sat 19 times during this period. As a highly respected Barrister he was required to sit on many specially arranged commissions some examples being:-13\n\nOn 11 April 1628 the soldiers billeted in Dorset removed to Plymouth to go for Rochell with the Earl of Denbigh but they were left behind and so returned to be billeted in the County again. twenty three of them had come from Dorchester and were refused re-entry which incensed Sir Thomas Frier their Colonel. He obtained letters from the Council to the town and procured a commission of Sir Thomas Trenchard, Sir John Brewen, John Browne and Henry Drak Esq to examine Richard Bushrod who was described as �an agent in deterring other men from billeting�. Richard Bushrod was well respected in the town and as the prime mover with John White behind the creation of the Dorchester Company in which John Browne invested. John was also related to the Trenchard family through his marriage and it is probably due to their influence that nothing more serious seems to have come of it.7\n\nOn 23 May 1632 he sat on another especially arranged commission at Weymouth to try the Captain of a Portuguese pirate ship which had been seized. He sat with Sir Francis Ashley, Sir Thomas Trenchard and Sir Nathaniel Napper to hear the case. The Captain was condemned but reprieved.7\n\nIn December 1648 he was appointed as one of the 135 judges to try Charles I who was accused of being a \"tyrant, traitor and murderer; and a public and implacable enemy to the Commonwealth of England.\" In fact only 68 turned up for the trial and he appears to have been one of those less than happy about being associated with the trial and did not sit. 17\n\nMarriage and Children:\n\nHe married in his wife�s parish of Charminster where the Parish Register for St Mary's church shows �John BROWNE Son of Sir John Browne Knight of Frampton & Elizabeth TRENCHARD daughter of the Right Worshipful Sir George Trenchard married 13th Nov 160711. Elizabeth Trenchard (1586/7 - 1656/7) had been baptised in Charminster on 28 Feb 1586/87 the daughter of Sir George Trenchard of Wolfeton and his wife Elizabeth Speke. She died 25 Jan 1656/7. Both John Browne and his wife shared John Whites vision for Dorchester and Lady Browne in 1631/2 gave £10 towards 'the employ of the poor in work\" and this was handed to the Governor of the Hospital so that according to her request her name might \"remayne in record to posterity amongst many worthy benefactors\".20\n\nChurch of St Mary - Charminster\n\nPicture by Lynda Small 2003\n\nThey had 4 sons and 6 daughters:-10\n\n1.

This is from the Charminster Marriages Volume 2 edited by P Philimore & Edmund Nevill published in 1908: I suspect the latter is a transcription error reading a 3 for an 8 and have relied on the visitation which is likely to be more reliable & we know a marriage settlement was signed on 12 May.\n\n12.
