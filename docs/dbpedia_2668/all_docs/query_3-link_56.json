        "text": "Horoscope and chart of Devon Aoki\n\nAstrological portrait of Devon Aoki (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 68,840 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Devon Aoki's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Devon Aoki.\n\nN.B.: as this celebrity's birth time is unknown, the chart is arbitrarily calculated for 12:00 PM - the legal time for his/her place of birth; since astrological houses are not taken into account, this astrological profile excerpt is less detailed than those for which the birth time is known.\n\nThe dominant planets of Devon Aoki\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nWarning: when the birth time is unknown, which is the case for Devon Aoki, a few paragraphs become irrelevant; distributions in hemispheres and quadrants are meaningless, so are dominant houses and houses' accentuations. Therefore, some chapters are removed from this part.\n\nFor all paragraphs, the criteria for valuation are calculated without taking into account angles and rulerships of the Ascendant and of the Midheaven. The methodology retains its validity, but it is less precise without a time of birth.\n\nElements and Modes for Devon Aoki\n\nDevon Aoki, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.\n\nThe predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, Devon Aoki. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces, and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word \"feeling\" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action, to the detriment of a certain vulnerability against which you should learn to fight.\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nDevon Aoki, the Cardinal mode is dominant here and indicates a predisposition to action, and more exactly, to impulsion and to undertake: you are very keen to implement the plans you have in mind, to get things going and to create them. This is the most important aspect that inspires enthusiasm and adrenalin in you, without which you can grow weary rapidly. You are individualistic (maybe too much?) and assertive. You let others strengthen and improve the constructions which you built with fervour.\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Devon Aoki\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Devon Aoki, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are the Sun, Saturn and Mercury.\n\nOne of the dominant planets in your birth chart is the Sun. He symbolizes will, magnetism, sense of honour and dignity. You are a Solar being, and you often display charismatic and leadership qualities. Your warmth and your persuasive power lead you far away from pettiness. You enjoy thinking big and, consequently, you move forward according to what you decide.\n\nYour Solarian weakness may be related to the sin of pride or to excessive authority. The frontier between pride and vanity is tenuous: be careful not to overstep it and to keep the nobleness of heart that is part of your charm.\n\nSaturn is part of your dominant planets: among the facets of your character, you have a grave and serious side, wise and somewhat severe, since your concentration can be powerful to the detriment of carelessness and friendliness.\n\nYou often look austere, but it is only an appearance, a kind of modesty or reserve; however, it is true that the Saturnian, who is fond of time, effort, asceticism, rigour and sobriety, may have popularity issues. Nevertheless, honesty and straightforwardness, reliability, as well as slow, wise and deep mental process, although not very popular and visible qualities, eventually become noticed and appreciated. Saturnians' second part of life is usually easier and more fulfilling.\n\nLike the Jupiterian, your Saturnian facet prompts you to seek the essential, security, and longevity. However, the difference with the former is that you will never give priority to wealth or \"the bigger, the better\" philosophy for the sake of power. Saturn, like Jupiter, symbolizes social integration, and it is usually considered positive to have a harmonic Jupiter and Saturn in one's chart because of their social adaptation capacities.\n\nYour vulnerability lies in your too serious and austere side, which may lead to unwanted loneliness and affective frustration. This generally does not last because Saturnians often hide deep down a golden heart that ends up revealing itself...\n\nWith Mercury among your dominant planets, you are certainly cerebral, nervous, swift, curious, quick-witted, and you love to communicate. Your psychological pattern is intellectual, all the more so since Mercury is important, with its whole set of assets but also of weaknesses, obviously.\n\nYour sensitivity, emotions, and heart's impulses give precedence to thinking, which can lead people to believe that you are a playful and witty but heartless person, intellectualizing situations and juggling with words and numbers whilst ignoring human aspects of things. Of course, it is said that cats always land on their feet - this is your Mercurian strength and your trump card!\n\nYour weakness lies in your nervousness, and you may miss your goal because of your \"over-intellectualization\" that may be detrimental to other kind of energies such as instinct, spontaneity, heart, sensitivity, etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Scorpio, Leo and Aries. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nWith Scorpio as a dominant sign, you are a strong and astute person, complicated and passionate, sometimes destructive and intolerant, but strong-willed, tough and daring, sometimes bordering on aggressive. So many qualities and dangers combined in one person! Obviously, this often results in a natural selection of people around you: those who stand up to you or admire you and those who can't bear you anymore! But that is precisely what you want. You are what you are and you are not going to transform yourself just to please. You are too proud and you never dread confrontations, although your way of fighting is secret, as is your nature that, mysteriously enough, you are so reluctant to reveal even to your close friends who will never understand you. That said... what a hellish charm you have!\n\nWith Leo as a dominant sign, you naturally shine brightly. Your dignity, your sense of honour, and your generosity can almost turn you into a solar mythological hero, a knight or a lord from the ancient times. People may blame you for your selfishness, your pride or your somewhat loud authority, but if you are self-confident, kind-hearted and strong-willed, it surely makes up for your little flaws, as long as they remain moderate...\n\nArian blood runs through your veins! You have that enthusiasm, frankness, courage, and fastness which usually make you so likeable in spite of your somewhat rough, naive, or violent side. As a bonus, Aries' gushing fire always gives you the impetus to make a fresh start, should you stumble or undergo life hardship!\n\nAfter this paragraph about dominant planets, of Devon Aoki, here are the character traits that you must read more carefully than the previous texts since they are very specific: the texts about dominant planets only give background information about the personality and remain quite general: they emphasize or, on the contrary, mitigate different particularities or facets of a personality. A human being is a complex whole and only bodies of texts can attempt to successfully figure out all the finer points.\n\nThe Moon in Aries: her sensitivity\n\nYour temperament is impulsive, Devon Aoki, you are fond of instant thrills and you do not like to wait because you grow weary quickly. With you, things must keep moving fast! Your vivid imagination triggers enthusiasm, audacity and independence because you need to undertake and to achieve. You do not fear to be defeated and, far from slowing you down, rivalry and struggle have a stimulating effect. Because of your sensitivity all on edge, you are irascible and unpredictable: it is easy to unwillingly get you started and this makes your life a bit difficult with the family and with friends. You are perceived as an impatient person, short-tempered, whimsical, unstable and even, aggressive, and people think that you don't take your entourage's needs into account. However, you may also be warm, ready to help and to comfort whenever you are able to control your impulsiveness. You must not be worried about losing your identity when you listen more to your close friends...\n\nMercury in Virgo: her intellect and social life\n\nYour capacities for logic and analysis are very good, Devon Aoki, and you evaluate each and every aspect of a given situation in objective and critical ways. You are industrious, methodical, with a lot of nervous energy, you pay attention to details and you may spend lots of time in intellectual and painstaking works. Although you are articulate, you do not like to be in the forefront and you prefer to work in team rather than to take initiatives: you feel less anxious when you know what is exactly expected from you and what you need to do. You tackle problems with rationalism and you distrust imagination and intuition. You love letters as much as you love figures. Your caustic humour may destabilize your entourage who may prefer that you were less demanding and more demonstrative. Please bear in mind that not everything can be kept under control...\n\nVenus in Cancer and the Sun in Leo: her affectivity and seductiveness\n\nIn your chart, the Sun is in Leo and Venus, in Cancer. Is Sun in Leos desire for conquest compatible with Venus in Cancers fundamentally selective character? The need to shine, with the desire for security? These antagonisms constitute the complexity and the richness of your affective life. However, these two summer signs have in common an exacerbated sensitivity and an emotionalism all on edge. While Leo is conquering, Cancer wants to be tender. Both signs are selective, touchy and often whimsical. Your concept of the couple is dramatic, as demanding as it is thrilling and, at the same time, pernickety and endearing. Your affective fulfilment goes through a double desire: esteem and recognition for the Sun in Leo, and situations of confidence and intimacy for Venus in Cancer. Such desires are not incompatible, despite the difference of their nature. If your partner can grasp the ambiguous character of this duality, your attachment will be unfailing.\n\nYou are sensitive, vulnerable and tender at the same time, Devon Aoki. When you love, you give your entire affection and your partner may in all confidence rely on a long-lasting and reassuring relationship. You are so calm and so tender that you think that it is enough to win over your partner's heart, and you are often right. However, do not mix up giving and receiving. You so deeply need to receive love in return that you may be too passive and in the long run, as you become demanding, you may show immaturity. Security and sustainability in your relationship are of utmost importance. Your family also is important, it is the refuge, even the sanctuary, where you like you hide when things go awry. You also dream of love, may be too much, and it may be detrimental to what might be concretely experienced if you were more dynamic or less fearful to get hurt. However, remember that you receive only as much as you give.\n\nThe Sun in Leo: her will and inner motivations\n\nPsychologically speaking, your nature is powerful and self-assured. You are a leader whose strength and nobleness naturally arouse your entourages respect and adherence and your legitimacy is unquestioned. Your sense of commandment, the honour your person constantly exudes, your prestige and your charisma is a whole which puts you into the spotlight wherever you go.\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are proud, determined, wilful, loyal, solemn, generous, ambitious, courageous, heroic, full of vitality, creative, confident, seductive, happy, daring, proud, majestic, honest, magnanimous, charismatic, responsible, noble, brilliant, radiant, dramatic, affectionate, full of humour, demonstrative, swaggering and self-confident.You can also be domineering, conceited, touchy, authoritarian, stubborn, intolerant, self-centered, irascible, violent, and nonchalant\n\nIn love, Madam, you are so proud and you have so much self-confidence that, at the beginning, you will probably need some time to find the partner whom you deem worthy of you.\n\nYou shine and you need to be told so; more often than not, your partner, too, must shine Pre-requisites seem to abound. However, as you mature, you will understand that all that glitters is not gold and that gold may be even more solid when it is less apparent. Then, you will reach higher levels of harmony with your partner.\n\nYour weakness probably lies in your sensitivity to splits, a sort of major ordeal you will not be able to overcome rapidly.\n\nYou are a charming partner, with a lot of humour. You are brilliant, bubbling and you receive your guests wonderfully well, all the more so if they belong to your world. Your children will be particularly important to you and they will immensely contribute to your happiness.\n\nMars in Scorpio: her ability to take action\n\nYour iron will is part of your assets, Devon Aoki. It is supported by an ingenuity and a skilfulness that may turn you into a mighty and feared personality. You have the knack of spotting weaknesses in persons you deal with and you can easily hurt them with your innate propensity to drill or to test their force. You are extremely stubborn and you never let go when you are convinced that you are right. Sexually, you are potent and passionate. You are domineering and secretive, with a magnetic personality. It is safer to avoid being taken in a conflict with you because you may be very aggressive and you bear grudges. In some cases, you may also be sadistic. Your personality is as secretive as it is domineering in the areas of action and sexuality.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis text is only an excerpt from of Devon Aoki's portrait. If you want to get your own astrological portrait, much more comprehensive that this present excerpt, you can order it at this page. Do you belong to the Jupiterian type, benevolent and generous? The Martian type, active and a go-getter? The Venusian type, charming and seductive? The Lunar type, imaginative and sensitive? The Solar type, noble and charismatic? The Uranian type, original, uncompromising and a freedom-lover? The Plutonian type, domineering and secretive? The Mercurian type, cerebral, inquiring and quick? The Neptunian type, visionary, capable of empathy and impressionable? The Saturnian type, profound, persevering and responsible? Are you more of the Fire type, energetic and intuitive? The Water type, sentimental and receptive? The Earth type, realistic and efficient? Or the Air type, gifted in communication and highly intellectual? 11 planetary dominants and 57 characteristics are reviewed, quantified, and interpreted; then, your psychological portrait is described in detail, in a comprehensive document of approximately 32-36 pages, full of engrossing and original pieces of information about yourself.\n\nAstrological reports describe many of the character traits and they sometimes go deeper into the understanding of a personality. Please, always keep in mind that human beings are continuously evolving and that many parts of our psychological structures are likely to be expressed later, after having undergone significant life's experiences. It is advised to read a portrait with hindsight in order to appreciate its astrological content. Under this condition, you will be able to take full advantage of this type of study.\n\nThe analysis of an astrological portrait consists in understanding four types of elements which interact with one another: ten planets, twelve zodiacal signs, twelve houses, and what are called aspects between planets (the 11 aspects most commonly used are: conjunction, opposition, square, trine, sextile, quincunx, semi-sextile, sesqui-quadrate, quintile and bi-quintile. The first 5 aspects enumerated are called major aspects).\n\nPlanets represent typologies of our human psychology: sensitivity, affectivity, ability to undertake, will-power, mental process, aptitude, and taste for communication etc., all independent character facets are divided here for practical reasons. The twelve signs forming the space where planets move will \"colour\", so to speak, these typologies with each planet being located in its particular sign. They will then enrich the quality of these typologies, as expressed by the planets. The Zodiac is also divided into twelve astrological houses. This makes sense only if the birth time is known because within a few minutes, the twelve houses (including the 1st one, the Ascendant) change significantly. They correspond to twelve specific spheres of life: external behaviour, material, social and family life, relationship, home, love life, daily work, partnership, etc. Each planet located in any given house will then act according to the meaning of its house, and a second colouration again enriches those active forces that the planets symbolize. Finally, relations will settle among planets, creating a third structure, which completes the planets' basic meanings. A set of ancient rules, which has stood the test of experience over hundreds of years (although astrology is in evolution, only reliable elements are integrated into classical studies), are applied to organize the whole chart into a hierarchy and to allow your personality to be interpreted by texts. The planets usually analysed are the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which means two luminaries (the Sun and the Moon) and 8 planets, a total of 10 planets. Additional secondary elements may be taken into account, such as asteroids Chiron, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres (especially Chiron, more well-known), the Lunar nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, and even other bodies: astrology is a discipline on the move. Astrological studies, including astrological portrait, compatibility of couples, predictive work, and horoscopes evolve and become more accurate or deeper, as time goes by.\n\nPrecision: concerning the horoscopes with a known time of birth, according to the Tradition, we consider that a planet near the beginning (called cuspide) of the next house (less than 2 degrees for the Ascendant and the Midheaven, and less than 1 degree for all other houses) belongs to this house: our texts and dominants take this rule into account. You can also choose not to take this shift into account in the form, and also tick the option Koch or Equal houses system instead of Placidus, the default houses system.\n\nWarning: In order to avoid any confusion and any possible controversy, we want to draw your attention upon the fact that this sample of celebrities is very complete and therefore, it also includes undesirable people, since every category is represented: beside artists, musicians, politicians, lawyers, professional soldiers, poets, writers, singers, explorers, scientists, academics, religious figures, saints, philosophers, sages, astrologers, mediums, sportsmen, chess champions, famous victims, historical characters, members of royal families, models, painters, sculptors, and comics authors or other actual celebrities, there are also famous murderers, tyrants and dictators, serial-killers, or other characters whose image is very negative, often rightly so.\n\nRegarding the latter, it must be remembered that even a monster or at least a person who perpetrated odious crimes, has some human qualities, often noticed by his/her close entourage: these excerpts come from computer programmes devoid of polemical intentions and may seem too soft or lenient. The positive side of each personality is deliberately stressed. Negative sides have been erased here - it is not the same in our comprehensive reports on sale - because it could hurt the families of such people. We are hoping that it will not rebound on the victims' side.\n\nNumerology: Birth Path of Devon Aoki\n\nTestimonies to numerology are found in the most ancient civilizations and show that numerology pre-dates astrology. This discipline considers the name, the surname, and the date of birth, and ascribes a meaning to alphabetic letters according to the numbers which symbolise them.\n\nThe path of life, based on the date of birth, provides indications on the kind of destiny which one is meant to experience. It is one of the elements that must reckoned with, along with the expression number, the active number, the intimacy number, the achievement number, the hereditary number, the dominant numbers or the lacking numbers, or also the area of expression, etc.\n\nYour Life Path is influenced by the Master Number 11, Devon, which indicates a strong, demanding, and uncompromising destiny. It is all about revelation and early calling. You feel that you are entrusted with a mission, with the certainty that no setback could endanger it, and your own certitudes prevail over any other motivation. You have a lot of strength, and sometime, intransigence. Short-lived fashions and life vagaries cannot weaken your beliefs. You pursue a set direction, in quest of an extraordinary destiny, with the help of your intelligence, your inspiration and the natural influence you have over people. Even though your entourage may not always understand your secret determination and perceive you mainly as an impatient person, your fortitude overcomes many a doubt and obstacle. You can sacrifice everything for the sake of your deep aspirations.\n\nDevon Aoki was born under the sign of the Dog, element Water\n\nChinese astrology is brought to us as a legacy of age-old wisdom and invites us to develop an awareness of our inner potential. It is believed that the wise man is not subjected to stellar influences. However, we must gain the lucidity and the distance without which we remain locked up in an implacable destiny. According to the legend of the Circle of Animals, Buddha summoned all the animals to bid them farewell before he left our world. Only twelve species answered Buddha's call. They form the Chinese Zodiac and symbolize the twelve paths of wisdom that are still valid nowadays.\n\nThe Asian wise man considers that a path is neither good nor bad. One can and must develop one's potentialities. The first step is to thoroughly know oneself.\n\nYou belong to the category of reliable people, true to their principles as well as loyal to their friends. You try to organize your life settings. If you are not concerned with the disorder that is external to your private sphere, everything related to your personality and your environment must be in order.\n\nTherefore, you are a perfectionist by nature, but you are also anxious and meticulous to an exaggerate point: you enjoy discussing details, analyzing and criticizing everything. Your concern is to keep your realm under control, which implies a fair amount of modesty and some distance.\n\nThe Dog is aware of his limits and he prefers to stick to what he masters rather than being tempted by some exceedingly adventurous conquest. But the capacity to control your realm constitutes an obvious asset, an extraordinary driving force favouring your evolution. As one contents oneself with doing well in the field which one thoroughly masters, one can go far, very far...\n\nMethodically - sometimes with your own method - you allow the dust to settle, you purify, using a process of elimination, until the essentials only remain. You may be lacking ambition. It does not matter! You leave panache and veneer to other people and you take up challenges in your unique way, with discretion, moderation, modesty or reserve.\n\nChinese astrology has five elements, which are referred to as agents: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water.\n\nYou have a deep affinity with the agent Water. In China, this element corresponds to the planet Mercury, the black colour and the number 6.\n\nYou are particularly sensitive to your surroundings, the atmosphere of a place and the climate of a meeting. Your high receptivity allows you to perceive naturally the stakes underlying people and situations.\n\nYou are reserved by nature, you favour emotions and inner life, leaving challenges and audacity to other people. You frequently maintain a certain distance and you share your true feelings with few intimate friends only. It is probably because you know that genuine communication is a difficult exercise.\n\nEverything in your realm is sheer subtlety and nuance. The danger is that you may escape realities and indulge in indolence without fulfilling your responsibilities. This is the other side of the coin of your extraordinary sensitivity and your exceptional clear-sightedness.\n\nYou feel in tune with few people. However, this selectivity forges relationships that are long-lasting because they are natural and genuine.\n\nN. B.: when the birth time is unknown, (12:00 PM (unknown)), these portrait excerpts do not take into account the parameters derived from the time, which means, the domification (Ascendant, astrological houses, etc.). Nonetheless, these analyses remain accurate in any case. Regarding the sources of the birth data in our possession, kindly note that the pages we publish constitute a starting point for more detailed research, even though they seem useful to us. When the sources are contradictory, which occurs rarely, after having analysed them, we choose the most reliable one. Sometimes, we publish a birth date just because it is made available, but we do not claim that is it the best one, by no means."
