        "text": "The Latin word \"Rex\" means \"king,\" but the word also describes rabbits and cats with a certain type of curly coat. With the Devon Rex breed of cats, both definitions may apply. Devon Rexes can rule a household. Their owners often treat them like kings, won over by their unique appearance and their loyal, loving, and sociable personalities.\n\nThere are four breeds of Rex cats. The Devon Rex is the second oldest, but it's still a new breed, originating in the English county of Devon in 1960. Besides their wavy coat, the large ears and unusual head shape of the Devon Rex also stand out.Â\n\nDevon Rex Characteristics\n\nDevon Rexes are named for their coats, but you'll probably notice their ears first. Devons have very large ears with wide bases that sit low on the head. Add in large eyes, and Devons might remind you of aliens or extraterrestrials you've seen on TV.Â\n\nDevons have thin necks topped by wedge-shaped heads. Unlike some cat breeds that have flat faces, Devons have strong facial features with short but well-defined muzzles, cheekbones, and chins. The whiskers and eyebrows are fragile and break easily, so they are usually short.\n\nMost cats, including Devons, have three kinds of hair. Guard hair is the longest and coarsest. Awn hair is shorter and softer. Down is the softest and thickest. In Devons, the guard hair is short and \"rexed,\" which means curly or crinkly. These three kinds of hair create a coat that is visually interesting and nice to pet.Â\n\nThe Devon Rex is medium in size with a lean, muscular body and longish legs. Their coats and eyes can be any color.Â\n\nThe lifespan of the Devon Rex is 14 to 17 years, sometimes more.\n\nThe official standard for the Devon RexÂ describes the breed as alert and active. Owners describe the Devon Rex personality as:\n\nPlayful\n\nLively\n\nIntelligent\n\nCurious\n\nSociableÂ\n\nBecause cats often appear aloof, some people compare the friendly Devons to dogs. Devons even wag their tails when they are happy!\n\nGrooming. Rex cats rarely require grooming. Stroke them with your hands or wipe them with a chamois to spread the oils throughout their coats. An occasional wipe with a damp cloth or a pet wipe will keep them fresh. Check their ears often, and clean them when they get dirty or if wax builds up.Â\n\nFeeding. Devons have a reputation for being foodies. They will eat their own food and yours, too. Some Devons like to snack on dry food all day. Others will overeat if food is always available. Most vets advise feeding adult cats twice a day. High-quality food is important. Your vet is a good source for advice about cat food.Â\n\nWater.Â Cats need fresh water. Clean and refill their water bowl often. Some may prefer a cat water fountain. Cat experts say that they may drink more if you separate their food dish and water dish. Cats have a keen sense of smell, and food smells may interfere with their drinking urge.Â\n\nExercise. Devons are curious and will pursue exercise independently. Toys can keep them occupied for quite a long time. If you don't supply toys, they may climb the drapes or use your treasured items as playthings.\n\nProtection against fleas and ticks. Fleas and ticks can be a problem, even for indoor cats. If you spot fleas or ticks, take your cat for treatment. Do the same if you notice:\n\nYour cat scratches a lot.\n\nYour cat's skin is red, irritated, scabby, or flaky.\n\nYour cat is grooming more than usual.\n\nAsk your vet whether you should treat your cat to prevent flea and tick problems. Some products, such as flea collars, are no longer considered safe for cats. Instead, your vet may recommend an oral medication.Â\n\nProtection against worms.Â Your vet can design a program to protect your cat against internal parasites. All cats should be on year-round medication to prevent heartworms. Cats that live outdoors or in warm climates are especially at risk.Â\n\nTooth and nail care. Brush your Devon's teeth to prevent dental problems. Ask your vet to recommend a good toothpaste. A tall scratching post will keep your cat's nails in good condition.\n\nTemperature sensitivity. Because their fur is so short, Devons are not well-insulated against the cold. They need a warm bed. Many enjoy getting under the covers of their owners' beds.Â\n\nIndoor living. Most cat care experts recommend cats stay indoors. Cats that are allowed outdoors may:\n\nContract diseases\n\nPick up fleas, ticks, and other parasites\n\nBe struck by a car\n\nSuffer attacks from dogs, wild animals, or other cats\n\nBe exposed to poisons and toxins\n\nGet stuck in trees\n\nEncounter humans who are cruel to them\n\nKill birds and small animals\n\nTo be sure your cat is happy indoors, provide a scratching post, interactive toys, and places where they can perch and climb.Â\n\nLitter boxes. Indoor cats require litter boxes. Most prefer roomy boxes and unscented litter. All cats appreciate clean litter.\n\nVet visits. Cats should see a veterinarian at least once a year. Twice a year is better. This wellness visit should include a physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, stool sample, and heartworm test. Ask your vet about screening for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) and feline leukemia virus.Â\n\nHealth Problems to Watch for With a Devon Rex\n\nAlthough it is a healthy breed, watch for these Devon Rex health issues.Â\n\nDevon Rex myopathy. Devons can inherit a type of myopathy or muscle disorder. The disease usually occurs in the first 6 months of life and stabilizes around 9 months of age.Â Some cats have a more severe course of disease than others. The worst problems come from the cat's inability to support its head and neck. This can cause death by choking. Breeders can prevent this disorder by genetically screening their breeding stock.\n\nFading kitten syndrome.Â Devon rexes are at risk for a form of fading kitten syndrome. This form may occur when a female cat with type B blood mates with a tom with type A. The female cat will develop type A antibodies and pass them to her kittens through nursing. The antibodies will attack the red blood cells of any type A kittens. If owners spot this problem in time, they can hand-feed the kittens. Soon, the kittens' tummies will mature, and they will no longer be at risk.Â\n\nHypertrophic Cardiac Myopathy (HCM). Some breeds, including the Devon Rex, are at risk for the genetic form of HCM. This thickening of the heart muscle may cause no problems, but it can also lead to congestive heart failure and death. There's currently no way to screen Devons for the genetic problem. Vets can use periodic echocardiograms to check for HCM. If diagnosed, the condition can be treated with medication.\n\nHistory of the Devon Rex\n\nIn 1960, Beryl Cox of Devon was caring for a feral cat. When the cat had a litter in her garden, Cox saw that one kitten was a beautiful male with a curly coat. Cox adopted the kitten, naming him Kirlee. She believed the father to be a feral curly-coated tom living nearby in an abandoned mine.\n\nCox learned a curly-coated cat had been born ten years earlier in Cornwall. For ten years, a group had been trying to establish a breed of curly-coated cats from that cat, Kallibunker. Cox offered Kirlee to the breeders, who accepted. When Kirlee's offspring had straight hair, the breeders decided Kirlee did not have the same genetic makeup as Kallibunker.\n\nLater, Kirlee was bred with one of his own offspring and produced a curly-coated cat. The breeders recognized that they had two gene pools of cats with Rexed coats. They dubbed Kallibunker's line Cornish Rex. Kirlee's offspring became Devon Rex. At first, cat breed associations lumped the two breeds together as Rex cats. The Rex breeders knew their differences well, though, and continued to keep their bloodlines separate. Slowly, the official organizations recognized the two breeds."
