My grandfather Frederick, married Isabelle Quarm from Kingsbridge/Dodbrook. His sisters were called Alice and Elsie and his brother Frank went to work in Insurance in South Africa. I have lots of infor on the Holman side, but non on the Frederick family. If anyone has any information I would be delighted. Thank You. PROVO\n\nI'm wondering if anyone knows anything of, or has ever heard of, the Provo family that lived in Dartmouth, Devon? The family rumour is that they fled to England from France during the French Revolution, and that they were rather rich. My grandmother can remember her second great aunt Louise/Louisa Provo, but I have never come across this person in all of my research ??? I'm really interested in tracing my French roots. I know that French middle names like Lefevre and Minett were common in our family, so I believe the French connection does exist; but I've no idea when or where it comes in. My guess is that it would appear towards the late 1790s. I would be really grateful for any insight or advice at all.

Sorry to be so confused , my dad had a gran who he called granny fisher. Because there was confusion with the barrett surname. His dad had wed a lady with the same surname so all they had , had to do was change the end barratt to barrett. And so the gran kept her maiden name, so that when she visited they knew which gran would arrive...My grandfather (dads dad) was in the royal navy,and when he was due to retire was sent to be a coastguard in wales, then salcombe devon, then back to the royal navy,to finish his time. That was the 1st.Ww. I dont know if the fisher lady died before the war or during. But does anyone have a stray fisher/barrett. I have a photo of her. And she is very pretty. By the way my grandfather lived in ottery st mary before he joined the navy... Seeking more information on Emma STEER b. 15 Oct Devonshire, England\n\nHi, I'm seeking more information on my maternal ggggrandmother Emma STEER. I know she was born in Devonshire, England on 15 October, but I have no idea which year. She died on 12 October 1951 in Lowell, MA. Her mother's (my gggggrandmother's) name was Maria. I got all of this information from talking to my grandmother, so some of the dates could be slightly off. I also know that she married Albert MILLER, but I don't know when or where. He is also from England, though I'm not sure which part, and was a mariner when they lived in Chelsea, MA. According to my grandmother he was lost at sea. They had at least one child, Herbert James MILLER, born 21 November 1891 in Chelsea, MA. He married Mary Francis HINES and died July 1940 in Tewksbury, MA. I would appreciate any information about Emma's husband and son, what year she was born, when she came to the United States, and who her parents were. Thank you!

William Henry Hooper\n\nWilliam Henry Hooper was born on August 27, 1868 in Devonshire, England (according to Mount Royal Cemetery records in Montreal) and the names of his parents are unknown. WHH had stated to my father that in 1882 at the age of fourteen years, he visited his sister (name unknown) in Canada and then returned to England to complete his education. After his parents died in the 1880's, WHH moved and resided with his uncle (name unknown) in Mevagissey who operated a hotel at that time. WHH worked as a butcher in Mevagissey near the hotel. In the late 1880's, WHH immigated to Canada where he continued with his trade as a butcher. There are family tales that WHH was born with the surname, Vickers-Hooper and that when he arrived in Canada, he dropped the Vickers from his surname. The Vickers surname is believed to originate from an association with the Vickers Gin Distillery family of the time. Furthermore, there was another family tale that WHH may have been a twin, his sibling being named Sidney Newton Hooper who died at a very young age. Upon his arrival in Canada, WHH took up residence first in Oshawa, Ontario where he met his future wife, Mary Gertrude Menagh (born: August 2, 1875) and they were married in Montreal on June 10, 1896 by Rev. Donald Grant. I just located William Henry Hooper's death recording in the Hooper family bible, as follows: \"William Henry Hooper died March 15, 1947 at his home 5047 Clanranald Ave, Montreal, Que. Burial March 18, 1947 at Mount Royal Cemetery. Dr. Lawrence Fisher of Queen Mary Road United Church officiated at the burial service\" I am very interested in learning anything at all about my grandfather and his past and if you could assist in my endeavour, whether from your data or direct me elsewhere, I would be very much appreciated."
