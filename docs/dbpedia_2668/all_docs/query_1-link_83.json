Surrounded by his loving family and best friend and soulmate Alison “Baby”.\n\nAndy was blessed with his greatest gift – his beautiful son Felix. He was the best Daddy and Felix’s biggest fan. On February 3rd, 1983, a beautiful baby boy was born to Ron and Marina Whiteway completing their family of 5. His brothers Trevor (Mel) and Omar (Kimberly) were so proud to have a baby brother to love and cherish for their whole life. Andy grew up in Grandois, a place he always called home, often reminiscing about playing in the cove with the smell of salt water and the cool breeze on his face.\n\nAndy loved all things and everyone so deeply. Family was at the forefront, always looking forward to the next get together even if it was just “the 6”. Andy could play anything with a string and loved every opportunity he had to jam with the boys. He was always singing even in the darkest of days. You would often go down to “The Shed” and the first thing you’d hear was Andy singing and tapping his feet. He was so proud of the shed he built creating a space for all he loved.\n\nAndy was passionate about many things. He loved to play darts (he was an amazing dart player) and a good ol round of golf. He was a true team player and that shined through whether he was playing hockey, softball or just a night playing board games.\n\nAndy holds a special place in the hearts of all who knew and loved him. Growing up some of Andy’s best friends were his cousins. Really all the crowd “up home” were so special to him. Life takes you in all directions, but he always had a special place for everyone. Andy could make a friend anywhere he went.\n\nAndy was the special uncle to his only nephew Oliver and his nieces Cailey and Finley. A son in law to Ethel Noseworthy, a brother in law to Jason (Chantal), Mark (Jocelyn) and Adam (Launa) and great friend to Darrell, Chris, the by’s from darts, his band mates and neighbours George and Diane.\n\nAlison and the family would like to thank all who cared for Andy with kindness in their hearts and a gentle touch. Kim was Andy’s 24/7 Nurse, sister and best bud. Thank you for taking such good care of Andy and for continuing to take care of us all. Dr. Armstrong, Dr. Adams, Dr. Gaviolli, Dr. Katie MacDonald, the support at the Dr. H. Bliss Murphy Centre and the palliative care unit at the Miller Centre. All the wonderful people who rallied around Andy, making sure all his wishes were accomplished.\n\nAndy’s wit and laugher brought light to everyone around him, his strength and courage was admirable. When you look up at the stars at night know he is looking right back at you.\n\nAn invitation-only funeral service will be held at The Carnell Memorial Chapel, 329 Freshwater Road, on Wednesday, January 12th at 11:00AM."
