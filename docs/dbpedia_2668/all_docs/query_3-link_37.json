Figures are roughly in line with the national picture, which has seen birthrates falling gradually over a quarter of a century.\n\nThe number of children being born in Torbay is falling.\n\nThere were 959 births in the bay in 2023, down from 995 in 2022 and 1,092 in 2021.\n\nFigures are roughly in line with the national picture, which has seen birthrates falling gradually over a quarter of a century.\n\nCampaigners who want more support for families in need say having a family has become a luxury, with the cost of living crisis and difficulties in getting affordable childcare.\n\nThe Torbay figures are in a report going before Torbay Councilâ€™s schools forum next week.\n\nDecreases in babies being born has repercussions for schools, with fewer children coming into the education system. Across the country, question marks hang over the future of some rural primary schools, among them the one at Kingswear.\n\nSecond homes have been cited as a reason for falling numbers, but the declining birthrate is also a factor.\n\nIn Torquay, 592 babies were born in 2021, with 522 in 2022 and 517 last year. In Paignton the figure dropped from 411 to 387 and then to 363. Brixham saw 89 births in 2021, falling to 86 and then 79.\n\nAcross Torbay the average number of children for every 1,000 women aged between 15 and 44 dropped from 49 in 2021 to 43 last year."
