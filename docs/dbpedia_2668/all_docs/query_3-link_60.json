        "text": "I specialize in helping people heal from their pasts, get clear on where they’re headed, and find the courage to move forward in their lives. In a nutshell: I work with people on a spiritual path to help them get unstuck, reconnect with their intuition, and begin to live an unbridled life. But my methods are a bit different than most.\n\nI use Equine Coaching – which is, in its simplest form, healing and awakening through horses.\n\nI’ve experienced the healing of horses firsthand. Now I spend my days bringing people and horses together in a safe space where I teach people how to let go of self-sabotage and pick up the reins of their lives.\n\nI’m the Equestrian of the Wellness World. And I’m not afraid to be vulnerable about my life, flaws and learning curves.\n\nI’ve connected to and developed my intuitive feminine nature. And now, I help other women do the same.\n\nBut it wasn’t an easy trail.\n\nI’ve struggled with my own mind and emotionally painful past many times over the years. In fact, I spent a large part of my life dealing with bulimia and depression and suppressing who I am.\n\nI was in a treatment center in Arizona, attempting to finally deal with my issues, when I first encountered equine therapy – and everything changed.\n\nInside the arena that day was the first time I ever became vulnerable and expressed my true feelings in front of others.\n\nI poured my heart out in the presence of a horse and what happened next changed everything for me: The horse didn’t run away. He came closer. For the first time ever, it was safe to express my authentic emotions without feeling weak.\n\nIt was so freeing that I immediately started crying – and a huge wave of self-compassion rolled over me. In that one moment, I was finally able to forgive and release myself from the past.\n\nAnd it hit me: It wasn’t my pain that was killing me. Not expressing my true self had smothered every bit of my light.\n\nDevon Combs is the founder and leader of award-winning Unbridled Retreats®. Named “Equestrian of the Wellness World” by esteemed Canyon Ranch Resort in Arizona, Devon helps people find purpose through the healing power of horses. Her synergy with horses and intuitive coaching provide profound breakthroughs for those seeking to unlock their potential.\n\nA lifelong horsewoman with a charismatic and down-to-earth attitude, Devon experienced the healing powers of horses firsthand. Her empathic work with others grew directly out of her own journey through bulimia and depression. When at the crossroads, equine therapy saved her life. Her experience opened the door to her life’s work transforming people’s lives through horses.\n\nDevon is a globally recognized Equine Coach, inspirational speaker, and contributing author to the Amazon bestseller, Speaking Your Truth: Courageous Stories from Inspiring Women.\n\nDevon and her work have been featured in Travel + Leisure, Sunset Magazine, Good Morning America, COWGIRL Magazine, Horse Illustrated Magazine, Travel to Wellness Magazine, The Saturday Evening Post, Horsemanship Radio, and Ali Brown’s Glambition Radio."
