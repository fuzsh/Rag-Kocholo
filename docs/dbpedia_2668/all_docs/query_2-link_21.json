        "text": "William Tuff Whiteway was an architect.\n\nHe lived at 1949 Barclay Street from 1905 to 1907 and at 1958 Barclay Street from 1908 to 1916. (His wife, Ada, lived at 1958 Barclay Street until 1958).\n\nHe designed buildings in St. John’s Newfoundland; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Victoria, British Columbia; Port Townsend, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; and several places elsewhere in British Columbia.\n\nEarly Life in Eastern Canada\n\nWilliam Tuff Whiteway was born in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland. (Musgrave Harbour’s earlier name was “Muddy Hole.”) Various sources give William’s birthdate as April 1, 1857 or April 30, 1859.\n\nWilliam’s parents were Robert Whiteway (1818-1875) and Ann (“Annie”) Tuff (1824-1908). Robert and Annie were married on May 19, 1842.\n\nRobert Whiteway died in St. John’s, Newfoundland, on September 2, 1875.\n\nAnnie died in St. John’s on February 4, 1908.\n\nWilliam worked in Newfoundland, sometimes as a carpenter and builder.\n\nWestern North America and First Marriage\n\nBy the early 1880s, William had moved to British Columbia, where he continued to work as a carpenter.\n\nOn March 5, 1884, in Victoria, William married Lizzie (Elizabeth) Sketchley. She was born in England about 1858. (Her full name may have been Barbara Elizabeth Sketchley.) Lizzie’s parents were William Sketchley and Elizabeth Sibson.\n\nAbout 1886, William and Lizzie moved to Vancouver. The 1887 Vancouver directory described William as an architect.\n\nIn 1888, William was an architect in Port Townsend, Washington, practising with Julius C. Schroeder.\n\nIn the spring of 1888, William and Lizzie went to live in San Diego, California.\n\nLizzie died in San Diego on June 8, 1888. She was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in San Diego.\n\nWilliam later returned to eastern Canada, where he worked as an architect.\n\nMarriage to Ada Croft\n\nBy 1900, William was back in British Columbia. On January 6, 1900, in New Westminster, he married Ada Croft. She was born on January 18, 1871, in Stamford Bridge, England. Her parents were Christopher Croft (1841-1932) and Sarah (1848-1925). (Sarah’s surname may have been Poulton.)\n\nThe Croft family emigrated from England to Canada in 1892.\n\nIn 1901 and 1906, Ada’s parents, Christopher and Sarah, lived in the Gainsborough area of Assiniboia East in the Northwest Territories. (After the 1905 creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan from part of the Northwest Territories, Gainsborough was in southeastern Saskatchewan.)\n\nBy 1911, Christopher and Sarah were back in England. Sarah died in Thirsk, Yorkshire in 1925. Christopher died in Thirsk in 1932.\n\nWilliam and Ada in Vancouver\n\nFrom 1900 to 1940, William and Ada lived at the following addresses in Vancouver.\n\nWilliam and Ada often lived apart and it appears that they eventually divorced. (William’s death certificate indicated that he was divorced. Ada’s death certificate stated that she was widowed.)\n\nWilliam’s architectural practice was extensive. He designed schools, fire halls, apartment buildings, and office buildings. One of his more famous projects was the World Building, commonly known as the Sun Tower.\n\nThere is controversy about who designed the World Building. According to some sources, George Lister Thornton Sharp (1880-1974) (https://westendvancouver.wordpress.com/biographies-n-z/biographies-s/sharp-george-lister-thornton-1880-1974/) claimed that he made the first sketches. In any case, the notion of having a narrow tower on top of a shorter, wider building was not unusual. The Singer Building (1908) and the Woolworth Building (1910-1912), both in New York City, were larger examples of the same concept. The Smith Tower in Seattle (1910-1914) was closer to the scale of the World Building.\n\nIn 1915 William was a candidate to become Vancouver’s mayor. He was not a serious candidate, however, and it appears that he was really in the race to ensure that Louis (“L.D.”) Taylor would win a controversial election.\n\nWilliam received only a few votes, and L.D. Taylor became the mayor.\n\nWilliam continued his architecture practice. From 1923 to the late 1930s he lived in a series of apartments in downtown Vancouver.\n\nIn 1930, Ada was in Seattle, Washington, along with her two sons, Gordon and Wilfred. (The 1930 United States census described Ada as a widow.) She returned to Vancouver, and from 1933 to 1958 she lived at 1958 Barclay Street.\n\nBy 1938, William was also at 1958 Barclay Street, although the Vancouver directory described Ada as the home-owner. William was only residing there.\n\nWilliam died in Vancouver on October 9, 1940.\n\nAda died in Vancouver on May 19, 1958.\n\nWilliam and Lizzie Sketchley had the following children.\n\nNora Ethel Whiteway\n\nNora Ethel Whiteway was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on December 18, 1884.\n\nIn 1901 she was living with her parents in Vancouver.\n\nOn December 27, 1906, in Vancouver, she married James Walter Warren, who was a miner. He was born in Goldenville, Nova Scotia, on May 18, 1878. His parents were James Warren and Ellen Glencross.\n\nJames later worked as a crane operator in a ship yard.\n\nNora died in Essondale, British Columbia, on June 7, 1940. She was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nJames died in New Westminster, British Columbia, on January 17, 1957. He was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby.\n\nLillian (“Lily”) Stafford Whiteway\n\nLillian (“Lily”) Stafford Whiteway was born in British Columbia on June 7, 1885 (or June 27, 1886), possibly in Victoria.\n\nShe married Richard Samuel Morrison in Portland, Oregon, on January 27, 1908.\n\nIn 1910, Lily and Richard were living in Seattle, Washington. In 1921 they were in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1940 and 1958, Lily was living in San Francisco, California.\n\nLily died in San Francisco on February 19, 1965.\n\nFrank Sketchley Whiteway\n\nFrank Sketchley Whiteway was born in San Diego, California, on May 20, 1888.\n\nIn 1895 he travelled with his father from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia.\n\nIn 1901 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1908 he married Edith R. Hoagland in Clarke County, Washington.\n\nIn 1918 he registered with the United States military system. He was living in San Francisco.\n\nIt appears that he was living in in Tucson, Arizona in 1940.\n\nIn 1958 he appeared in the Nevada marriage index. He was married to Marion T. Scott.\n\nHe died in Los Angeles, California on March 6, 1972.\n\nWilliam and Ada Croft had the following children.\n\nWilliam Gordon Whiteway\n\nWilliam Gordon Whiteway was born in Whatcom County, Washington on July 24, 1900, probably in Bellingham. (Some sources give his birthdate as September 15, 1901, or September 1902.)\n\nIn 1901, 1911 and 1921 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1930 he was with his mother in Seattle, Washington.\n\nOn March 21, 1936, in Seattle, he married Grace V. Collins.\n\nHe died in Vancouver on September 30, 1959.\n\nWilfred Ewart Whiteway\n\nWilfred Ewart Whiteway was born in Vancouver on September 12, 1910 (some sources say 1911).\n\nIn 1911 and 1921 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1930 he was with his mother in Seattle, Washington.\n\nHe did not marry.\n\nHe died at New Vista Care Facility in Burnaby, British Columbia on December 14, 1987. He was buried in Forest Lawn Burial Park in Burnaby. (His death registration indicated that had been living with mental retardation all of his life.)\n\nSources\n\nRobert Whiteway (father of William Tuff Whiteway)\n\nMusgrave Harbour, Wikipedia article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musgrave_Harbour: “Musgrave Harbour is a fishing community that was originally named Muddy Hole.
