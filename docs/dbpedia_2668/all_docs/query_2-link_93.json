        "text": "Politics False Statements. Some of the Tories who lately returned from St. John's have falsely reported that Sir William WHITEWAY has gone to England and that he was summoned there by the Imperial authorities. It is scarcely necessary for us to say that such a statement is a gross and deliberate falsehood, as any one of common sense must know. Sir William WHITEWAY, or any other Premier, is in no respect amenable to the Imperial government for his political actions in this colony. The people are the only real tribunal that he need fear, and when an opportunity offers, there is no question but they will endorse his policy more so than ever in the past, and return his party to power with sweeping majorities. It is true that the Courts of our land may decide against him, but it is even possible for prejudice to permeate the highest earthly tribunals in existence, and more eminent interpreters of law than those who administer law and justice in our land may take an entirely different view of the statute under which these election cases have been tried, and just as correctly, come to the conclusion that the decisions given have been wrong, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the election, and the custom that has prevailed regarding the expenditure of public monies for more than fifty years. But as we have said, the report of the People's Leader being summoned to England is a pure fabrication of the Tories. It is by falsehood and deception that they have hedged into power, and they are going to try to hold on by the same unmanly and unprincipled course of action, but they are not likely to succeed as the electorate of the colony are not going to be imposed on the this unpatriotic manner. A Noble-Hearted Priest By advices from Coachman's Cove, as well as from information furnished by the shipwrecked people themselves, we are placed in possession of pretty well all the details regarding the loss of the ill-fated schooner \"Rose\", while on her way to Labrador. Most of those details have already appeared in these columns; but there is one circumstance connected with the unfortunate affair which deserves special mention. We refer to the self-sacrificing conduct of the noble-hearted Roman Catholic priest of Coachman's Cove - the Rev. Father SHEAN. As soon as the survivors reached port and he became acquainted with the disaster, the Reverend gentleman hastened to their relief. He found them in the deepest distress, and some of them with no covering beyond their scanty night-clothes. His big generous heart was touched and the tears ran down his cheeks at the sight of so much human suffering. But he did not stop here: with a bag across his shoulders he proceeded from house to house, among his hospitable people, getting a coat here, a dress there, and some other article somewhere else, until the bag was filled, when he returned to the sufferers, placed the contents at their disposal and continued his labor of love, not resting till all that could possibly be done for them was accomplished. In this pre-eminently selfish age, such actions as these shine across the pathway of life like bright rays of sunlight after a dark and stormy night. We are proud to find among the outlying settlements of the colony, men of Father SHEAN's goodness of soul; and we may be sure that our pride is not lessened anything by the fact that he is a native Newfoundlander - a Newfoundlander \"to the manor born\". - Evening Telegram, July 3. Caplin There has been an abundance of caplin in some of the coves this week and many barrels have been taken for manure. Shipping News The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake\", Capt. DELANEY, comes North this trip. She did not leave St. John's until Thursday evening, and may be looked for here some time this evening. Her trip extends as far as Griquet this time. The next trip of the Northern coastal steamer will extend as far as Red Bay, Labrador to connect with the mail steamer \"Windsor Lake\", which was to have left St. John's on the 2nd inst. For the coast, going as far as Hopedale and Fanny's Harbor the first trip. (The \"Grand Lake\" left Seldom-Come-By, 10.30 this morning and will be expected here about five or six o'clock this evening.) The \"Jubilee\", Stephen NEWMAN, master, left for St. John's on Thursday morning with a cargo or seal oil for the firm of J.B. TOBIN. The \"Terra Nova\" arrived from St. John's Thursday afternoon. Late local papers were received by her, extracts from which will be found in other columns. The \"Mary Parker,\" Capt. CARTER, belonging to E. DUDER, left for St. John's last Saturday evening with a cargo of oil and returned on Thursday, bringing a load of merchandise. She made the round trip in five days. Codfish Codfish have been exceedingly scarce around our shores the past week, and scarcely anything at all has been done. The prospect has not been worse for many years. Diphtheria Diphtheria has been prevalent at Leading Tickles for some time past, and Dr. SCOTT has been visiting that locality to give medical treatment to the afflicted ones. Mr. James NOSEWORTHY at Thimble Tickles (a place near by) we are sorry so say, lost five children from this disease. New S.A. Yacht A new yacht built at Robert's Arm the past winter by Mr. Francis WARR for the Salvation Army, arrived here from that place last Saturday evening. This little craft is called the \"Salvationist.\" She is a handsome model, sloop rigged, about thirty tons, and is intended for evangelistic work on the Labrador for which she appears to be admirably adapted. This, no doubt, is a step in the right direction on the part of the Salvation Army. Exploration Party TABOR and LLOYD Exploring Party. The TABOR and LLOYD exploration party sailed for Labrador in the s.s. \"Swallow\" this morning. They go as far as Nain on the Labrador coast. The members of the party are; TABOR and LLOYD leaders; MURPHY, manager of the drills; REGADD, seaman; WHELAN, pilot; and RENDELL, chief engineer. The party were photographed in a group. There was a general hand-shaking. good byes and good luck to you. - Daily News, June 30. Shipping News Port of Twillingate. Entered.

Died At St. John's on the 26th ult., Jessie [looks like RHYMA ] Holmes, beloved wife of Ernest G. MARTIN. Little Bay Closed (Part 1) \"Mining Operations Suspended at Little Bay.\" \"Need for Public Works.\" It is with much regret that we learn of the closing down of Little Bay mine. The vigorous operations that have been carried on there have given remunerative employment to hundreds of our people, and the suspension of work will be a severe loss, not alone to the place, but to the district and the country in general. It is over a year since operations were considerably curtailed, and it was hoped all along that a fresh impetus would again be given to the mining industry there, but we are sorry to find that such hopes have been blighted, as instructions were received to the effect that operations are to be entirely suspended for the present. A considerable quantity of ore has been taken out the past winter and spring, and it cannot be altogether owing to the scarcity of copper ore that such an action has been taken on the part of the owners, as we learn, of late the mine is looking better than for some time past. Little Bay Closed (Part 2) But as it is quite deep, and other expensive machinery would be required shortly for raising the ore to the surface, the low price of copper just now may not warrant the proprietors in making the large additional expenditure necessary for carrying on operations, and this may be one of the chief reasons why they have ceased. But it is hoped that it is not for very long. At any rate it is a sad blow for Little Bay as there are many families there who were solely depending on the employment which the working of this mine gave, and now that this forum is closed, they know not where to look for support. Seeing that so many of our people have thus been unexpectedly thrown out of work, it is only right and proper that the Government (of which Mr. GOODRIDGE is now Premier and has the power), should come to their assistance in this emergency, and we trust that no time will be lost in dealing with this important matter. There is that road from Hall's Bay to Exploits, to connect with the railway, which was started last year by the WHITEWAY government, and on which a large number of men could be employed. Little Bay Closed (Part 3) This will be found to be a most valuable road, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary by opponents of the WHITEWAY party. It was used last winter as the mail route for that part of the district, and the short time that the mails were received from St. John's alone, shows its value. The money for such work is already provided, as there is upwards of forty thousand dollars of the amount raised by the WHITEWAY government still unexpended, and if the GOODRIDGE party include such expenditures on public works as bribery under the Election Act, they need not be afraid that such a mean, cowardly and unmanly advantage will be taken of them by the Whitewayites, in thus providing our Little Bay people, or others, with labor on this road, out of the balance remaining over for railway connecting roads. Therefore we trust that prompt action will be taken on their behalf. Death \"Death of Mr. R.G. STORY.\" The sad intelligence was received here on Saturday last of the death of the Rev. G.P. STORY, ex-president of the Methodist Conference. He had been residing at Whitbourne the past year and was in tolerably good health until a little over a month since, when he was taken very ill, and was removed to St. John's about a fortnight before his death. Mr. STORY was a Guardian and Chaplain of the Methodist Home before the buildings were destroyed by fire in 1892, and was re-appointed to that position by the Conference which closed at St. John's last week. Last year, the honor was conferred upon him of being elected as President of the Conference, and worthily filled that important office. In his demise, the Methodist Church has lost a true and valiant worker and one that is likely to be greatly missed in the execution of plans for the furtherance of the various agencies in connection with the Methodist denomination in this colony. Though he may be personally unknown to many of our readers in these parts, we dare say his name is familiar to hundreds, particularly to the Methodist people, as he was editor of the Methodist Monthly Greeting, which finds its way into many of their homes. We tender our sympathy to the sorrowing wife and family in their bereavement. Escapade \"Yesterday's Escapade at SHEA's\". There was an amusing escapade on SHEA's wharf yesterday. Messrs. MARSHALL & RODGERS, who have refused payment of duty on goods under the present Tory regime, concluded yesterday to get up a few cases of stock, very much called for by customers. To avoid Tory red-tapeism, they paid duty on those distinct cases, and procured a permit. Mr. RODGERS proceeded to SHEA's wharf with a carman and had those cases put on the car, and, before he had time to take the permit from his pocket, tidewaiters, who had 'till then been in other parts, came hastily along and began throwing off the load without any painstaking or questions. Meanwhile, Mr. SHEA came down and spoke in vehement terms of pains and penalties. Mr. RODGERS gave a happy side smile at the fili-busters; then added: \"Look here, George, you have notified us to take away our goods. Now I have come down with a car and you cry out against it. See here, I want to know what time will suit you for me to come down with a few dozen cars, and take the lot away. Will half-past two do?\" \"Oh! It is no use in your coming down like that,\" replied Mr. SHEA, \"I will have the doors closed.\" and away he skipped. Then the permit was produced, accompanied with the imperative order: \"Load up that car again,\" and the tide-waiters had to do so. Meanwhile, some Customs officials ran to the Colonial Building to report a riot on for 2.30; while Mr. SHEA rang up the telephone and related to Fort Townsend and other places, particulars of the scenes that were to be. Policemen were marched down, and other necessary precautions against \"another riot\" were taken. The poor Tories were on a string, and suffered enough mental worry to cause serious prostration, while Mr. RODGERS, like a good citizen, went his way laughing - Telegram, July 4.

General Superintendent, for his very able, earnest and impressive charge delivered on that occasion, and that the same be published in the 'Greeting' .\" Schooners Collide \"A Collision\". A schooner called the \"Mary Jane\", Archelaus TAYLOR, master, of Harbor Grace, while beating into St. Anthony Harbor one day last week, was run into by the schooner \"Blanche\", Thos. LANE, of Ragged Harbor, Trinity Bay, and in a few minutes the Mary Jane went to the bottom, the crew, seven in all, barely having time to jump on the other craft and get clear before going down. It was blowing a stiff breeze at the time and the Mary Jane had just tacked to clear a craft at anchor, and to avoid the land, and the Blanche, it is said, was going across the harbor, and might easily have avoided a collision. She struck about amidships, cutting the side in about twenty-two inches, and was immediately proceeding on her way, without stopping to see what damage had been done, or whether the craft would \"sink or swim\". The Mary Jane was going to the Labrador fishing and the loss is a severe one to all concerned. Shipping News The \"Terra Nova\" touched here yesterday from Indian Arm with a cargo of lumber for St. John's. The schooner \"A.G. Heisler,\" Capt. McKINNON, arrived from Sydney this morning with a cargo of coal for Harvey & Co. The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake\", arrived here Thursday morning going South. She reports a little being done with the fish about St. Anthony and other places along the coast. The \"Jubilee\", Stephen NEWMAN, master, returned from St. John's last evening, bringing back a cargo of provisions, &c., for the firm of J.B. TOBIN. She left there eight o'clock the previous morning and had a nice run home. The \"Victoria\", James NEWMAN, master, arrived from White Bay Thursday night, having gone there some time ago on a trading trip for Mr. WATERMAN. She brought back about 400 seals in casks and a quantity of seal skins. The fishery prospects in some parts of White Bay are very fair. The \"Ocean Traveller\" and \"Notre Dame\", belonging to Mr. R. QUIRK Fortune Harbor, left here for Labrador this week, one on Wednesday and the other on Thursday. The \"Star of the Sea,\" Maurice CARROL, master, of same place, also sailed on Thursday for Labrador. The steam launch \"Lance,\" belonging to Messrs. Job Brothers, St. John's, employed this year on the Bay to connect with the train at Norris' Arm, made her first visit here on Saturday evening last. Mr. John DALTON is in charge, who no doubt is well acquainted with the route the little steamer has to take. The Lance is much the same size as the \"Matilda,\" but for political reasons the GOODRIDGE party preferred going to St. John's for a steamer to perform the bay service this season. The route is different from last year, but whether it will prove as satisfactory to the general public remains to be seen. Weather It has been splendid growing weather of late and crops are looking well. Labrador Fleet All the Labrador fleet have taken their departure. We trust that favorable winds and weather will accompany them and that success will attend their efforts. The Fishery There is little or no improvement in the fishery around here the past week. A few boats got as much as a quintal one or two days but on the whole it is very scarce. All around this part of the shore it is much the same. At North West Arm, Green Bay, the early part of the week some boats did very well, getting from two to three quintals per day. Death Mr. Thomas BUCKLEY, of St. John's, died very suddenly of heart disease at Comfort Cove on the 3rd inst. Dr. STAFFORD left here in the \"Fleta\" to attend him but before he reached the place, death had done its fatal work. His body was conveyed to St. John's per \"Grand Lake\". Death We are sorry to learn of the death of J.C. DUDER, Esq., Sub-Collector of Little Bay, which took place on the 6th inst. He was in his 78th year, and although attaining this ripe age, he appeared to be quite smart and active until within a few months of his death. For nearly twenty years he has filled the office of Sub-Collector, first at Bett's Cove and then at Little Bay and was a most efficient officer. He bore his illness patiently and entered calmly into rest at an advanced age. To his sorrowing wife and family we tender our sympathy - under the trying ordeal through which they have thus been called to pass. Death We learn that Mr. John FRAMPTON, of Exploits, passed peacefully away on the 7th inst., at the advanced age of 70 years. He was one of the old standards, and for some years held the post of ferryman, and sexton in the Methodist church, which positions he filled satisfactorily. His funeral took place on Sunday last and was largely attended by relatives and friends, the ceremony being performed by the Lay Reader, Mr. Simon MANUEL, in the absence of Rev. Wm. SCOTT, who was attending Conference. For many years, Mr. FRAMPTON was a member of the Methodist Society, and was a well meaning man and consistent Christian. His end was peace. We sympathise with the bereaved family in their bereavement. Birth On the 9th inst., the wife of Mr. Charles BISHOP, of a son. Died At Little Bay on the 6th inst., J.C. DUDER, Esq., Sub-Collector, in his 78th year. Died At Exploits on the 7th inst., Mr. John FRAMPTON, aged 70 years. Shipping News Port of Twillingate.

TEMPLE, left here by the little steamer \"Lance\" on Monday last for Tilt Cove to take passage by the steamer \"Austerlitz\" for England, which was to sail for there on Thursday. Mr. TEMPLE left somewhat unexpectedly. He has a sister in a low state of health suffering from the insidious disease, consumption, and after a twenty years' absence, he felt that he would like to see her once more in the flesh, and as this favorable opportunity offered of getting to the Mother Country so quickly, by this copper steamer going direct, he decided to go by her. The Rev. gentleman is a most indefatigable worker, and for upwards off seventeen years he has labored incessantly for the spiritual good of the Church people here, as well as for the social and moral welfare of the community generally, and after so many years of constant toil, he is certainly entitled to a few week's rest, such as will be afforded by the trip on which he has just started. It will doubtless invigorate and better fit him on his return to re-enter upon the arduous duties devolving upon him in this parish. He expects to be absent about six weeks. We wish him a pleasant voyage across the Atlantic and a safe return to his family and Church flock, when the time comes for his journey homeward. New Church \"Laying Corner Stone Gower Street Church.\" The corner stone of the new Gower St. Methodist Church, St. John's was laid on the 5th inst., in the presence of a large concourse of people. The ceremony was a very imposing one. A platform was erected for the occasion on which, our contemporary, the Royal Gazette tells us, \"were representatives from the city choirs and several prominent ladies and gentlemen, as well as the members of the Quarterly Board, and Board of Trustees, and the ministers then attending Conference. Appropriate hymns were sung, and the Scripture read, and excellent addresses were delivered by Drs. CARMAN, WITHROW, MILLIGAN and DOVE, and also by the Hon, J.J. ROGERSON. J.E. PETERS, Esq., read the parchment and list of papers, coins, etc., which were placed under the stone, and R.K. BISHOP, Esq., presented the trowel to the General Suberindendent, Dr. CARMAN, who, before the vast assemblage, solemnly declared the stone to be well and truly laid in the name of the father, Son and Holy Ghost.\" Visiting Bishop \"Bishop BRENNAN's Visit North\". His Lordship Bishop BRENNAN was a passenger North on the \"Grand Lake\" last time, making the round trip, the steamer going as far as Griquet. He landed at nearly all the ports of call and was much pleased with the receptions received. When the steamer was here, both going to and returning from the North, his Lordship was the guest of Mrs. TOBIN. A Little Bay telegraphic correspondent to the Evening Herald of the 9th inst., referring to His Lordship's visit says:- \"The Grand Lake, having on board His Lordship Bishop BRENNAN, arrived at 2 p.m. yesterday. His Lordships visit being unexpected, was an agreeable surprise to his co-religionists on this Northern part of the island. Great was their regret that they had not been apprised of his coming, so that they might have prepared for him a right regal reception,. However, their welcome was none the less warm. At Pilley's Island the Bishop offered the holy sacrifice of the Mass, and preached a magnificent and most instructive sermon from the gospel of the day, taking as his text, \"Thou render an account of thy stewardship.\" The little school chapel was packed with hardy miners and their families, and the crew and some passengers of the Grand Lake. Bishop BRENNAN continued his pleasure trip North, and thus far is very highly pleased with the scenery, etc., on this side of our island home.\" Bishop BRENNAN seemed to be greatly delighted with his tour North as we gather from the Evening Telegram of Monday last:-- \"His Lordship Bishop BRENNAN, who has just returned from his round trip North on the Grand Lake, expresses himself well pleased with it. The scenery was most picturesque to the eye, while there was magnificent grandeur even in the towering barren rocks. He landed at all ports of call, and has warm expressions regarding the whole-souled, kindly disposition of the people.\" Death \"Death of Promising Young Man at Herring Neck.\" Dear Mr. Editor, I shall be much obliged if you will insert the following words in your valuable paper. Philip Bennet BLANDFORD. On the 30th of June, P.B. BLANDFORD passed from Herring Neck to be \"forever with the Lord\". The call to leave the earthly tabernacle was not unexpected by him, neither did it find him unready. All the time he was wanting to enjoy more of the blessing of the Lord that maketh rich, and addeth no sorrow with it. His testimony was \"I am going home to die no more\". The day before he died his sister asked him if he could not get to sleep. he said, \"I shall soon be asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep\". His death is keenly felt by his father and mother, who for may years have been partners in his joys and sorrows, and by the family. His end was peace. Yours sincerely, J.R. STONEY. Herring Neck, July 18th. Transatlantic Cable \"Arrival of The Cable Ships\". The cable ships, having on board the 1894 cable, arrived in Heart's Content - the \"Scotia\" on Friday, the \"Britannia\" on Monday. The coal tender, the \"Loughrigg Holme,\" also arrived on Monday morning. The Scotia is commanded by Capt. W.R. CATO; is 2,931 tons register; 368 feet long; 47 feet beam, and draws aft 28 feet. Her passengers and crew are numbered 130. She was built in 1879 by Messrs. THOMPSON & Co., Sunderland, and was in Heart's Content before - in 1880. Early on Monday morning, when about 60 miles off, in a dense fog, this steamer struck an iceberg, receiving considerable damages to her bow. She was going about 3 miles per hour at the time and struck the berg on a slant. Had her speed been fast, the result would have been disastrous in the extreme. One of the crew, a man aged 36 years, died from the shock of the vessel striking. He had been ill before, and was weakened. The shock affected and stopped the action of the heart. The Britannia, Captain KENNEDY, is a smaller vessel - about 900 tons. The Loughrigg Hoome is a coal-tender, about 1100 tons. The vessels are owned by the Cable Maintenance & Construction Co., (Ltd.), London. The steamers were expected to leave Heart's Content to-day on their trip to lay down the 1700 miles of cable necessary to connect both sides of the Atlantic. - H.G. Standard, July 9. The Courts \"Sir Terence on the Witness Stand\". Governor O'BRIEN appeared in Court this forenoon, in obedience to a summons, and gave his evidence in re the Placentia case. He was examined by Mr. EMERSON, Q.C., who elicited from him some important information. In to-morrow's Telegram we shall have something to remark about Sir Terence's evidence. Suffice it to say, for the present, that His Excellency seemed irritable and inclined to show \"a little temper\" during the examination. - Telegram, July 13. Cow For Sale A good milch cow is offered for sale. Intending purchasers to apply at the South Side Parsonage, on or before Wednesday next. J. HILL. Farming Grass has grown very well this season and in one or two fields around here, mowing has commenced. The crop this year is likely to be large. Appointment Mr. Willis DUDER of Little Bay, has been appointed Sub-Collector for that port in place of his late father, whose death was announced in last week's Sun. Mining The smelting works at Tilt Cove are in full swing and are very successful under the new manager, and mining operations there are prosecuted most vigorously. Fisheries Salmon have not been plentiful around our shores this summer and those who usually fit out for this fishery have done poorly. Some of the lobster packers are doing well. The Fishery We learn that two or three fishing craft have returned to Change Islands from the Northward with good fares. A few Southern craft have been seen passing our harbor bound home, apparently well fished. The \"Jubilee\", Stephen NEWMAN, master, left for White Bay yesterday morning on a trading venture for the firm of J.B. TOBIN. Reports from some parts of that Bay say that pretty good fishing has been done, though in other places it has been very poor. The fishery around our shores has been as bad this week as it has been at all, and that is bad enough, as many fishermen could not get sufficient to eat some days. The outlook is gloomy in the extreme, but it is hoped an improvement will soon take place. One of Mr. OSMONDs fishing craft returned to Morton's Harbor from the French Shore the early part of the week with about one hundred and twenty quintals cod fish. We learn that another schooner belonging to Expolits came back having done fairly. These are the first arrivals of any account so far this season. The Fishery \"Squids in Portugal Cove.\" Portugal Cove men were very fortunate this morning with squids. Boats with an average of two men each, jigged from a thousand to twelve hundred. Fish would not be caught by them, however. It is vexing to know that the ground is covered with fish but that they won't bite. Later on they may. - Telegram, July 16. Bay Steamer The Bay steamer \"Lance\" did not arrive here from Norris'' Arm, this week until early Sunday, the train not arriving there at the usual time, Saturday morning. She went as far as Fogo, which is her terminus on the Southern route, calling at Herring Neck and Change Islands, and returned here two o'clock Monday afternoon or her way around the bay. The Lance's route is changed, and instead of going direct to Shoe Cove from here, she goes inland and touches at the various ports of call, and coming as the Matilda did last season, which will be more accommodating to the public. Passengers The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake\", Capt. DELANEY, left St. John's on Tuesday morning and arrived here at 2 p.m. Thursday, visiting the usual intermediate ports of call. She had a good deal of freight and a large number of passengers. Several of the Ministers returning to their circuits were among the passengers including Rev. S. RUSSEL and wife for Morton's Harbor, Rev. C. WEED and wife, Rev. H. SCOTT and wife for Exploits, Rev. W. HUTCHINSON and wife for Little Bay Island, Rev. W. BROWNING and wife for Little Bay, Mrs. CORNER and child for Twillingate. The Grand Lake makes her first trip to Battle harbor to connect with the Labrador steamer and may not be expected back returning South before Wednesday or Thursday, next.

We understand that the judgement in the Trinity case was given on Wednesday last, resulting in the unseating and disqualifying of Sir. W.V. WHITEWAY and Mr. BOND, and the unseating merely of Mr. WATSON. The charges preferred against all the members petitioned against were somewhat similar, and as the judgement in the previous cases were adverse to the WHITEWAY party, we did not expect anything different in the Trinity case, as it appeared to be a foregone conclusion on the part of the conspirators, that the leaders especially should be \"killed out\" politically, that is if the unprincipled Tory faction, (to which his Excellency the Governor seems to be pandering), can have their way. It is evident that they are succeeding in their malicious designs for the present, but it cannot continue may months. As soon as the people have an opportunity of doing so at the polls they will show the unscrupulous politicians, who have wrenched the government from the WHITEWAY party, in the most mean and cowardly manner that ever any body of men could get control of political power, that they, Politics (Part 2) (the free and independent electors of this colony), are not going to be treated in such a shameful way, as they have been by the Tory faction, who have deprived them of the representatives of their own choice, because they were instrumental in getting a few paltry dollars expended in some of the small localities, on roads or some other useful public work. The very thing they have charged the members of the WHITEWAY party with, the GOODRIDGE-MORINE government are now doing themselves, that of expending public monies without any Legislative authority, and his Excellency the Governor, sanctions such illegal acts, on the part of the acting Executive Government by which he is now surrounded. Truly, Newfoundlander's are a poor down-trodden people, and the serfs in Russia could not be treated much worse. But never mind, there is a day of reckoning coming, and, notwithstanding the villainous attempts from the highest officials in the land to some of the meanest of them, to crush Sir William WHITEWAY and his Party of Progress out of existence, the vast majority of the people are with him, and when an appeal is made to the country, the result of the polls will more than show that Sir William is the most popular political leader we have ever had, and one of whom the fishermen and working classes of the country may well feel proud. Personal (Part 1) \"Anonymous Letters.\" It is greatly regretted that there should exist amongst us, persons evil-minded enough, to indulge in the writing of anonymous letters to private individuals, and by such a course, attack them as it were with a dagger in the dark, and thus attempt to secretly assail the private reputations of those, against whom they may happen to entertain personal spite or animosity. It is a course that is to be deprecated, and we can hardly think that any one, with a spark of honor or principle, would adopt such a plan to give vent to their spleen against the parties aimed at. It is mean and cowardly in the extreme, particularly when it touches the secrecy of the home, and attempts to destroy that harmony which a happy wedlock should ever create. If a person has anything to say to one with whom he or she may be at variance, why not face them in a straightforward and manly way, instead of sending anonymous letters? Personal (Part 2) It is the means too, almost invariably, of having the wrong persons suspected, and very often those who are entirely innocent are blamed, and we are sorry to have to publish a letter in today's Sun from Mrs. Andrew LINFIELD, positively denying the insinuations that have been currently reported, respecting the suspicion that has been put on her, of having written or sent letters recently received by Mrs. HILL. It is quite evident, however, that Mrs. L. had nothing to do with such a diabolical action, and for one to be accused falsely, is as bad as for the person who may be the recipient of such dastardly effusions. We are not aware that either Mr. or Mrs. HILL did anything while here, to merit such treatment from anyone, and we deeply deplore that spirit that has thus been manifested by the parties in the letters referred to, and while it may be enjoyed by them and be entirely confined to one or two individuals, we believe that the community as a whole, most strongly resents such a dastardly way of retaliating for a supposed wrong, or feeling of enmity that may be entertained for one another, because of any misunderstanding existing between them, and for the sake of the parties thus affected and the community at large, we are extremely sorry that such a mode of ventilating spleen should have been resorted to. Personal (Part 3) \"Wrongly Suspected\". (To the Editor Twillingate Sun) Dear Sir: - Permit me through the columns of your valuable paper, to deny emphatically, and to clear myself of a very mean, low, and disreputable thing that I was suspected of doing a short time ago. It appears that the Rev. Mr. or Mrs. HILL, I don't know which of the two, received some anonymous letters whilst in Twillingate, and between them, they suspected me of writing them, for what cause he would not satisfy me, but I simply say here sir, that I firmly believe it was for no other purpose but to malign, and to destroy my reputation, as that gentleman says those letters were very debased, and not fit to read. I take it as a gross insult. I will tell him my time is more profitably occupied. My husband and family, and business are of more importance to me than the affairs of private individuals. Yours respectfully, E.P. LINFIELD. Twillingate, July 26th, 1894. Bay Steamers (Part 1) Bay Steamer \"Lance\". (To the Editor, Twillingate Sun) Dear Sir :- A word or two relating to the SS Lance, our Bay steamer. We were pleased to take a short trip by her a few days age, and the travelling public will agree with me in acknowledging the great convenience such a boat is, on such an important bay as ours. And we must thank the WHITEWAY Government for their kind consideration of our rights in this respect, for to them the credit is due. Some of our Tilt Cove friends gave the pioneer boat the name of baitskiff. To the owners of that boat belong the credit of supplying bait at a low figure and there was no extra charge if you needed bait four times a day instead of two. We notice under a change of government a clean sheet, and you learn as you enter the saloon, that for every mile you travel under sixty miles you are to pay 4cts. per mile, and 3cts. per mile for sixty or over. From Twillingate to North West Arm is about forty-eight miles and would cost $1.92. You can hardly do it without taking four meals, two dinners, a tea, and a breakfast, costing you $1.00 making the total cost $2.92. The \"Virginia Lake\" or \"Grand Lake\" with first class accommodation in every particular, will take you to Little Bay or Nipper's Harbor for $2.00. Bay Steamers (Part 2) By the latter, business men and well-to-do people generally travel. By the former the poor class. We look upon the charge for fare and passage to be far too high, and it meets with general dissatisfaction in this Bay. It is hoped a change in this particular can be made. It is a wonder the hero of the bait-skiff letter of Tilt Cove, who made himself so prominent last year, is not more interested in Bay steam this year. I dare say he thinks to himself, \"I had just as well be quiet for no one will regard me now, for the one is a near picture of the other\". We found Capt. DALTON very kind and obliging, and consider him fully fitted for the post committed to his trust, and we feel assured he will give general satisfaction. The chief engineer and steward are very accommodating, and they are men who will make many friends before this season ends. The steward is a professional man and sets his table to the very best advantage. We predict for him fair complexion, if he has to cook for an average of six passengers beside the crew. We take exception to the mail man, and consider it an insult to this district to place a witness against Messrs. WOODS and MOORES in that office. We say such men ought to be compensated from the private purses of the petitioners. Yours truly, Observer. Little Bay, July 24th. Steamer Problems \"Letter from 'Voter', Pilley's Island\". (To the Editor Twillingate Sun) Dear Sir :- Will you please find space in the columns of the valued Sun for the following: Last Fall when Mr. GOODRIDGE was here, in a speech he made remarks to the effect that the steamer \"Matilda\" was a farce, and that it was one way in which the WHITEWAY Government was wasting the people's money, and we now find this year, not the Matilda of course, but a boat of much inferior accommodation. But she is all right, as she belongs to one of the Tory clique. How came it to be a waste of money last year if it is not so this year? Also, we find, this year, there are two men on the \"Lance\" doing the same work that young Mr. SCOTT did last year. We also find, sir, that this year the passage money is almost double as much as it was last year in the Matilda. In the Lance we find it is four cents per mile; twenty cents for breakfast, thirty cents for dinner, twenty for your tea. We will allow her 39 miles for a day's work, that will cost passengers $1.90 per day, which, I believe, Mr. Editor, will cost more than it will in the coastal steamer \"Grand Lake.\" And what do you think, Mr. Editor, she intended doing at first all the summer? Why, going straight to Tilt Cove, not calling in any of the localities between Exploits and there until her return from the North; thus, we would judge from this, sir, that Tilt Cove was one of the Tories best markets. Does Mr. GOODRIDGE think the working men of Green Bay are so dull that they can't reason for themselves, but they are not to be fooled by lengthy speeches with nothing in them. Should he again try this district he will find men who can both reason and recollect. Yours truly, Voter. Pilley's Island, July 23rd. Jottings From Little Bay. The fishery, this side of the bay and around, remains unchanged. At Shoe Cove a little has been done, boats there averaging about ten qtls.; the best trap and seine together, 60 qtls. Round Harbor averaged three qtls per man, Burying Place about the same; Nipper's Harbor and other places around about one qtl. per man. Tilt Cove, that of late has been looking dull, is brightening up. The new process of smelting lately introduced is thus far very successful. New smelting works are in course of erection near the mine, and when completed it is calculated about 6000 ton or ore per month will be smelted. A large skiff belonging to Mr. James NORRIS, of Three Arms, while beating in Little Bay Bight yesterday, upset by a heavy squall of wind. There were two men and a boy in it at the time, but they all managed to get on the bottom of the skiff and remained there till rescued by Mr. FINLAY, and brought safely to shore. The names of the men were WEBBER and BOWERS, and the boy is a son of Mr. NORRIS. About sixteen men left here this morning to travel to the railway via Hall's Bay line, where they are to be engaged in work to which they are well used, namely, breaking rock. Jottings From Little Bay. They were glad to hear the good news of work. Mr. GOODRIDGE and several of his merchant friends were present at Norris' Arm on Saturday last. It appears the secret bribers have commenced to lay their plans for the bye-election. They went to the end of the line. We wonder if they intend to run a branch line to Hall's Bay the summer. Mr. KNIGHT used to, previous to last election, make his name as conspicuous as possible by having it stamped on the outside of every paper. Recently he prints his name on the end of the paper and decently folds up that end so that his name may be hidden. Is it himself he is ashamed of, or is it the paper to which his name is affixed, that rag the Daily News? A steamer is expected here in a day or two to load with copper ore. A few men are working preparing tracks for shipping. The once flourishing settlement of Little Bay has a black pall thrown over its activity and death will soon take place. Crops here are looking very good. Politics are quiet, but red hot heat can be attained at the shortest notice, for the fire is smouldering that must obliterate the Knight as well as some of two sided pages. July 24th, 1894. Fisheries Lobsters have been fairly plentiful around our shores this summer and packers are doing a pretty good business. Some shipments of dry fish have been made. The price opens at $3.40 (seventeen shillings) which is lower than that given, the past three or four years for Shore fish. Icebergs A large number of icebergs have been seen around our coast all this season. The early part of the week, upwards of one hundred and twenty were visible from Long Point Light House. Passengers The bay steamer \"Lance\" arrived here from Norris Arm early last Saturday evening. Mr. And Mrs. DUFF and child and Mr. T. HODGE were passengers having come through by train to Norris Arm. The following took passage here by the \"Grand Lake\": -- Mrs. HARRIS and two children for Herring Neck; Rev. J. HILL Mrs. HILL, four children and girl for Wesleyville, Mrs. P. SAMWAYS and Mrs. Wm. HARBIN for St. John's. Shipping News The \"Mary Parker\", Capt. CARTER, arrived from St. John's on Wednesday, having first called at Herring Neck to land part of her cargo. She made rather a longer trip than usual having been several days out from St. John's. The \"Donny\", Robert LINFIELD, master, returned from St. John's Thursday afternoon, and the \"Maud,\" Samuel SHORT, master, arrived later, on her way to Little Bay Island. The Bonny's cargo was principally provisions and merchandise for the firm of J.B. TOBIN. Farewell Ladies of the Dorcas Society gave a farewell sociable on Thursday evening at the residence of Mrs. BAIRD, in honor of Mrs. HILL on the eve of her departure from this community. Mrs. HILL was president of the Society for over two years, and this mark of esteem was given as an appreciation by the members for the valuable services rendered during her connection therewith. The Fishery The fishing schooner \"William Paterson\", Archibald BLANDFORD master, arrived at Herring Neck from the Straits of Belle Isle on Thursday night last, with about four hundred barrels of fish, which was of a very good quality. The fishery has been very poor indeed and the majority of craft in quest of fish, did not get near half a catch. Many secured very little, and seeing the prospect was so poor, they proceeded to the Northern part of the Labrador, where we trust they will be more successful. The William Patterson sailed from St. John's. She landed her fish at Herring Neck to be cured and has left again for Labrador. The Fishery The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake\", Capt. DELANEY, called here going South on Wednesday last, having made her first trip to Battle Harbor to connect with the Labrador mail steamer. The fishery reports are of a very meagre character, as little or nothing had been done owing to the great jam of ice upon the coast, the more Northern part particularly. In consequence of this, the Windsor Lake could not get North of Cape Harrigan. In some parts of the Straits, the fishery prospects are reported to be good, but generally speaking, the outlook is not the brightest. But there is very little dependence to be placed in reports of the first or second trips, and it is hoped that later on there will be a decided improvement. Rev. J. HILL \"Departure of Rev. J. HILL.\" The three year term of the Rev. J. HILL, (Chairman of the Bonavista District) having expired in accordance with the itinerant wheels of Methodism, he took passage by the \"Grand Lake\" on Wednesday last, accompanied by his wife and children, for Wesleyville. During his term on this circuit, the debt on the Church property, amounting to something like one thousand dollars, has been entirely wiped out, and at present the churches on each side of the harbor are free from debt, while both have been renovated and newly painted inside and out in the meantime. The debt on the Church at Little Harbor has also been greatly reduced, in addition to what has also been done towards its completion inside, which shows that the affairs of the church have been well looked after during his three years of ministry on this circuit. Educational matters have also been carefully watched, and at the last meeting of the School Board, a vote of thanks was tendered him, for the efficient services bestowed and the interest taken, in the extension of educational facilities, as evidenced from his desire to inaugurate a superior school, which building is now in course of erection. We trust that success may attend his labors on this new circuit to which he has been appointed. Arrival of French Ship The French admiral ship \"Naiade\", arrived here at 6.20 last evening. She steamed slowly up the harbor, and when swung to her anchor, unfurled the British flag at the mainmast head and saluted it with twenty-one guns. As the last gun fired, the flag was hauled down very slowly. When down to the half, H.M.S. \"Cleopatra\" fired the first gun in an equal number in response, and as she did so, a blue jacket at the masthead set free, as if by magic, the tri-colour of France and on went the salutation. Vast numbers of citizens ran from numerous places to points of vantage to take the full of their eyes and ears of the scene and events. The Naiade is a frigate, wood constructed, ship rigged, and painted with old time white ports. She was built at Toulon, 1881, has 3,695 tons displacement, 246 feet length, 46.3 breadth, 21 feet draught of water, 2,800 indicated horse power, 530 tons coal capacity, 1 screw, 1 funnel, 13 knots speed, a balcony, shaded at top, running around her stern, high up and has large door windows opening to her upper and lower saloons, and has also electric dynamos, charging two electric search lights, which shed their brilliant rays last night along the water, the foreshore and hill sides. She has too, a band capable of discoursing musical treats. Its rendition of God save the Queen last evening was worthy of the keenest critics refined ears. -- Telegram, July 17.

Ship Collision \"For the Far North - The First Misfortune.\" The Red Cross Line steamer \"Miranda,\" which left St. John's on Sunday week last, bound for Labrador and Greenland, returned on Tuesday morning. At 8 a.m., on the morning of the 17th inst., in a dense fog, when about 10 miles North of Belle Isle, she collided end on with a heavy iceberg. What the result would have been had she not been going \"dead slow,\" 'tis not ;pleasant to consider - the danger to the ship and the passengers lives would have been great indeed. As it was, the steamer's hawse-pipes were carried away, and five of the bow-plates, fortunately above the water-line, were much injured. So serious was the damage that it was deemed wise to put the steamer into Cape Charles, Labrador, where temporary repairs were affected, and she thereafter returned to St. John's, where the needed repairs are being done. Most of her passengers were left down on the coast, hunting, fishing, etc. The party on board the Miranda consisted of 52 persons, composed mostly of students from Zule and Havard Colleges. The primary object the Expedition (which was under the guidance of Dr. COOK) had in view was, if at all possible, to reach Peary's headquarters at Bowdin Bay. The disaster to the Miranda was very unfortunate, inasmuch as it has interfered badly with the intentions of the party - one of which was for a party from Kansas University to land at Rigoulette, in order to survey the famous Great Falls at Labrador. This was but one of the objects had in view by the intrepid explorers. - H.G. Standard, July 27. Ship Services \"S.S. Lance\". (To the Editor Twillingate Sun) Permit me, through the medium of your valuable and widely circulated paper, to ventilate a real grievance which is inflicted upon the community of this important and thriving settlement by reason of its being precluded from the manifest advantages which would accrue to it by its being made a port of call, both ingoing and returning, by the Bay steamer \"Lance,\" which, under the command of so skilful a hand as Capt. DALTON, is doing excellent work, and is such a great boon to the general public in the districts of Fogo and Twillingate. Under the present arrangement the steamer calls here only once every round trip, viz. upon the return from Fogo to the North. For this service we are thankful; but we regard it only as an instalment of our rights. and not the whole, consequently we shall continue to agitate till the defect is remedied. When it is borne in mind that Change Islands lies directly in the track of Fogo, that it has a resident population of nearly 1100, that three large commercial establishments are flourishing there, and has a large number of planters and fishermen, second to none in the colony for their industry and uniting energy in their daily vocation, my contention is but emphasised, that the Government would only be doing an act of simple justice in taking measures to immediately secure for them the very fullest advantages and convenience which are to be derived from the present steam service. Our requisition we respectfully submit to the authorities, and which, we trust, you will readily give in the benefit of your able advocacy, is, that the Lance may call every trip, both going and returning, at Change Islands. By kindly inserting the above remarks in the next issue of the Sun you will confer a favor upon Your very faithfully, Tobias MacSTINGER. Change Islands, August 1st.

Mining The sylvan solitude of Belle Isle, in Conception Bay, is soon to be broken in upon, by a company who are going to open an iron mine over there. For some years past prospectors have been busy on the Island, and the samples shown, have induced a company to take hold of some claims. The specimens show a good paying percentage of iron, and we are informed that work will begin almost immediately. The company will not manufacture the iron on the Island at present, it being their intention to ship the crude ore to Nova Scotia. The mine ought to give a large amount of employment to the Belle Islanders. -- Trade Review. Religious \"Parting Address.\" To the Rev. R.W. FREEMAN and Mrs. FREEMAN from the People of Blackhead, Conception Bay. Blackhead, July 23rd, 1894. To the Rev. R.W. FREEMAN, -- Beloved and Dear Sir,- As the time has now come for you to leave this Circuit for another field of labour, we should feel recreant to our duty, if we were to let you leave us without some token of regard for the indefatigable manner in which you have laboured amongst us the past three years. Yours, indeed, has been a labour of love, and it has always been your joy to see the Circuit prosper spiritually and financially. We unitedly rejoice with you at the present prosperity. Your interest in the Sunday as well as the day schools will not soon be forgotten by teachers and scholars. Please accept this purse as a token of our esteem and regard. And, now, as you are leaving for another field of labour, we bid you good-bye, praying that the Divine blessing may follow you and Mrs. FREEMAN, and that the Great Head of the Church may bless your labors in the future as in the past. Signed on behalf of the congregation, John C. MOORES, Peter DIAMOND, Thos. B. LeGROW, Geo. E. MOORES, Jos. KING, Andrew VATCHER, Fred. LeGROW, Wm. BRENNAN, Jacob KING, John LACEY, W.W. KING, Richard MOORES, Jessie LACEY, Jos. THISTLE, Matthew LeGROW, sr. Religious \"Mr. FREEMAN's Reply.\" Blackhead, July 25th, 1894. Dearly Beloved Friends,- I thank you very much for the address and purse of gold you presented me with today. It was not necessary that I should be the recipient of either one or the other, for proof of your regard for Mrs. FREEMAN and myself. I am glad that my labours have been so much appreciated by you during the past three years. You truly say it has been a labour of love. The prosperity of the Church in its various departments, has been my aim; and whilst I have not realized all I desired and prayed for, yet I am devoutly thankful for what has been accomplished, both spiritually and temporally. The flourishing Sabbath and day schools, as well as the healthy financial condition of the Circuit, give ground to hope for a bright future. I pray that the blessing of the Great Head of the Church may ever rest upon you as a people, and that every worker and member may be endowed with \"power from on high\". Again thanking you for the tangible proof of your regard, I am, yours in the bonds of Christian love, R.W. FREEMAN. Religious \"To Mrs FREEMAN.\" Blackhead, July 23, '94. Dear Mrs. FREEMAN. It is a matter of general regret that your stay amongst us is so short. Never did three years glide away so quickly. Both you and Mr. FREEMAN have endeared yourselves to us by your labours and devoted Christian characters. It is with no fulsome praise that we speak when we refer to your great work as our organist, and we cannot but contrast the singing of today to what it was three years ago. And we are sure you valuable service in the department of the Church will long be held in grateful remembrance. You will also be missed in the Sunday school, where you have laboured so faithfully and earnestly to extend the Redeemer's Kingdom. Please accept the accompanying token of our affection, and be assured that our prayers will follow you to your new field of toil, where we hope you may be permitted to gather much fruit for the Heavenly Kingdom; and as you will not be far away, we hope to see you often. Wishing you and yours every blessing for both worlds, we are, Dear Mrs. FREEMAN, yours affectionately: Mabel J. LeGROW, Celia MOORES, Harriet HUDSON, Hester A. MOORES, Dorcas LeGROW Mary J. LeGROW, Miriam P. MOORES, Jane DIAMOND, Maria LeGROW, Mary A. LeGROW, Sarah BRENNAN, Hetty JANES, and others. Religious \"Mrs. FREEMAN's Reply.\" Blackhead, July 23, '94. My Dear Friends,- The presentation of your living address and purse was both a surprise and joy to me. I was not aware that I had done anything to merit at your hands such a marked proof of your good will. It is a matter of thankfulness that any effort I have made for the good of the cause has now your approval. The esteem in which Mr. FREEMAN is held, as well as myself, has been felt all through those three happy years spent amongst you. I do pray that by the way of the Mercy Seat, blessings abundant may ever rest upon you and yours. I should be glad to see any of you at any time in my new home where the same welcome will be given you as I know I shall have from yourselves. Good-bye and may God bless till we meet again. Yours very affectionately, Sarah L. FREEMAN. The Fishery There has been very good fishing at the Grey Island the last few weeks, and boats there have done fine work. The schooner \"Outstrip,\" Abraham Knight, arrived at Morton's Harbor from the North last week w9ith something over 300 barrels codfish. There has been no improvement in the fishery around our shores the past couple of weeks and the average catch to date is the lowest for the past twelve or fourteen years. The \"Jubilee\", Stephen NEWMAN, master, arrived from White Bay on Thursday, bringing back a quantity of salmon to the firm of J.B. TOBIN. The fishery reports along that coast are not very bright. Capt. Samuel SAUNDERS arrived at Change Islands from Belle Isle on Monday last with a full load of codfish. The gallant captain reports three other Change Islands' schooners loaded there and fish extraordinarily abundant. Cricket The cricket match played Thursday at Back Harbor between the \"Reds\" and \"Blues\" of the Wanderers Cricket Club, terminated in a magnificent victory for the former, beating the latter by an inning and tree runs. Ship Arrival The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake,\" Capt. DELANEY, which left St. John's Tuesday, arrived here Thursday morning. She had a large quantity of freight on board and about fifty tons of coal for the \"Windsor Lake\". Her trip this time extends to Battle Harbor and she may be expected returning South Wednesday or Thursday next. Court Decision \"A Gross Judicial Blunder.\" The Decision in the Trinity Election Case. \"This judgement does not in any degree reflect on the honesty, morality or integrity of the respondents.\" -- Judge LITTLE, in the Trinity election case. What a gross judicial blunder! Fancy a judge pronouncing sentence to the utmost extent of the law, in a case of alleged \"bribery and corruption,\" and then coolly and deliberately saying: \"This judgement does not in any degree reflect on the honesty, morality or integrity of the respondents.\" Nevertheless, this is exactly what Mr. Justice LITTLE said yesterday, in delivering his judgement in the Trinity election case. Can anything more absurd and inconsistent be imagined? Sir William WHITEWAY and Mr. BOND are in one breath declared guilty of \"bribery and corruption,\" and in the very next breath we are told by the learned Judge that \"THIS FACT DOES NOT IN ANY DEGREE REFLECT UPON THEIR HONESTY, MORALITY OR INTEGRITY.\" Truly, we may now ask: \"Where are we and whither tending?\" We have no desire to show the slightest disrespect for His Lordship's judicial consistency; but, really, it is very difficult to be as respectful as we could wish in the presence of such a conflicting decision as the one in question. next thing, we shall hear of a judge sending a prisoner to the penitentiary, and saying to the wardens, there is nothing against the honesty, morality or integrity of that man; but, all the same, he must to go prison. \"Away with him! Crucify him! The Tory faction hate him, and their thirst for vengeance must be appeased.\" -- Telegram, July 26. Drowning A sad accident occurred at Vernon River Bridge, P.E.I., recently. A little girl, only one year and seven months old, daughter of C.B. ROSS, painter, fell head first into a creamer barrel filled with water, and life was extinct before the little one was found. Birth On the 1st inst., at Too Good Arm, Herring Neck, the wife of Mr. Abraham HURLEY of a daughter. Ship News Port of Twillingate. Cleared: July 31 - \"Primrose\", BRAY, King's Cove, ballast - Captain. Fishery Some of our fishermen who secured squids this week, did better with fish than they had any time before, this season. Two boats arrived from the French Shore this week, one having about one hundred and eighty and the other seventy barrels. It appears that lobster packers on the Northwest Coast are doing fairly well, some of them securing as many as two thousand a day. The schooner \"Hunter,\" George PARSONS master, arrived from the Straits of Belle Isle Wednesday, with about two hundred and forty barrels of fish. We learn by intelligence from Peter's River that the fishery there has been most successful, so far. One man of that place has over three thousand quintals of fish ashore, and several of the others have also done well. The coastal steamer \"Grand Lake,\" Captain DELANEY, called here Tuesday morning, going South. She was as far North as Battle Harbor, and the fishery reports received by her are not very encouraging. On some parts of the coast the fishermen are doing a little, and in other places it is almost a failure. Schooner Arrival The English schooner \"St. Clair,\" Captain SINCLAIR, arrived from Cadiz, via St. John's Wednesday, with a cargo of salt for the firm of E. DUDER. Passengers The following took passage by the \"Grand Lake\" for St. John's: - Four Christian Brothers, Mr. R.D. HODGE, Mr. T. HODGE, Mrs. LETHBRIDGE, Mrs. CORNER and child. The steam launch \"Lance\" arrived from Norris' Arm last Saturday afternoon. The Rev. L. CURTIS, wife, two children and servant were passengers, having come through by train to Norris' Arm. Trading News The \"Victoria,\" James NEWMAN, master, arrived from a trading trip Tuesday afternoon, bringing back about one hundred and fifty quintals of cod fish, thirty tierce of salmon, and five hundred rabbit skins. Medical A report of the work of the Labrador Deep Sea Medical Mission for 1893 shows that during the season the three doctors, GRENFELL, BOBARDT and CURWEN, who were in charge, respectively, of the Battle Harbor hospital, the hospital ship \"Albert\", and the steamer \"Princess May\", treated 37 in patients and 2,493 out patients. Of these 798 were surgical, seventeen being performed under chloroform. Forest Fire A forest fire, supposed to be between the head of Hall's Bay and White Bay, has been raging the past week, and, without a doubt, has wrought great destruction among the timber in that vicinity. Too much care cannot be exercised by all who go to the woods, either for business or pleasure, and it should be borne in mind that heavy penalties are attached to the breaking of the laws in reference to forest fires. Schooner Wrecked A schooner called the \"Princess Alice,\" Capt. PIKE, of Burin, while beating up the North Side of the Straits of Belle Isle on the 30th of July, struck the sunken rock Soldier and became a total wreck. The Princess Alice was a fishing craft, and had about a hundred and fifty barrels of fish on board at the time, and nearly everything was lost. The crew of six men and two boys were conveyed to St. John's by the \"Grand Lake,\" Thursday last. This is a very unfortunate circumstance, depriving them as it does of the summer's voyage. Parting Address \"Parting Address to Mrs. E. HILL.\" Twillingate, July 24th, 1894. Dear Mrs. HILL: -- We, the members of the Twillingate Dorcas Society, regret that you are on the eve of leaving us, as we shall greatly miss your valuable services in connection with the Society. Not only as President but also as a good worker, your services have been appreciated by all, and we shall be very glad to know that in your new home, you will still be a co-worker with us in this great service. That the Divine Spirit may watch over you and family is our earnest prayer. Signed on behalf of the members of the Dorcas Society: K. BAIRD, S. NEWMAN, A. PEYTON, M. COOK, E. HODDER, E. ROSSITER, M.A. PRIDE, L. COLBOURNE, E. HUGHES. Reply to Address \"Mrs. HILL's Reply.\" To the Members of the Twillingate Dorcas Society. My Dear Friends: - I need hardly say that the address you presented me with on the eve of my departure was a great surprise to me, and is far too appreciative of my humble efforts as a member of your noble Society. Nevertheless, your address touched a tender cord in my heart, to learn that my weak endeavour to assist you in this good work of clothing the poor and destitute was not forgotten by you. It has always been a pleasure for me to meet with you to help on this good object. May we never forget the words of Christ, \"In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\" Thanking you for your kind wishes to myself and family. Wishing you success in your laudable work. E. HILL. The Fishery \"Returned from the Westward.\" The SS. \"Virginia Lake,\" Captain TAYLOR, arrived here at 5.40 o'clock last evening from the Westward. She reports several Fortune Bay schooners coming from the Mecatinas loaded with fish, and bringing good all round reports from that particular place. Lobsters are still plentiful on the Northwest coast, but not on this side. Several bankers have arrived at Grand Bank after their caplin baiting, with an average catch of 450 quintals on it. Fish is still abundant at Trepassey and salt very badly wanted, the stock being all used up. Nothing worth speaking of has been done at Cape Boyle the past few days. There are a few foreign fishing schooners there. The steamer brought about 1,000 boxes lobsters, a few barrels fish and a trifle of other freight. -- Telegram August 2. Accidental Death (Part 1) \"Death on the Track.\" Yesterday, when we announced that a special train was to run from Holyrood with cattle, driven there from the vicinity of the wrecked \"Texas,\" there was no anticipation of fatal results to any person, as there have been to one poor woman, to whom death came with awful promptitude in an hour when she least expected it. No. 10 engine, drawing three cars of freight, 32 head of cattle, left Holyrood at 2.05 yesterday afternoon for St. John's, with Robert CANDOW, driver; John DUNN, fireman; John BROPHY, conductor also doing \"brake\" duty, and George MERCER, brakeman. All these men are smart at their work, tried and true, ready to instantly act on sight and sound. Manuels, the scene of the sad accident, was readied at about 2.50. Running for Manuels on an up-grade and a curve precluded long range of sight. Here, too, is a down-grade, which has necessarily to be run somewhat freely to raise a more advanced up-grade. The \"stand\" was opened to view and quickly arrived at, and just from the line of it was seen, ahead on the track, about 300 yards distant, a woman, later recognised as Mrs. Fanny NOSEWORTHY, of Long Pond, near Villa Nova, aged 67 years, and having no family, husband alive. She was walking with the train. The driver blew for brakes, a quick whistle, and there was an immediate application, the engine being meanwhile reversed. Accidental Death (Part 2) The woman turned and saw the engine, but continued to walk on, probably to locate a favorable place to step clear. Then a danger signal was blown, followed by a second one. The woman looked around a second time, and started to step off; but, alas! too late! She went to the right hand side, had one foot over the rail, and, then, nervous and terrified, she hesitated, and that moment's hesitation proved fatal. One came the locomotive toward her, in spite of every effort to stop it. The cow-catcher lifted her from her feet, and, as she suddenly inclined back, her head struck the signal pole in the buffer, breaking it by force of contact, her death-stricken face meanwhile, being thrown back and upturned to the horrified driver, leaving an impression on his mind that will not soon be effaced. It was only for an instant; the cow-catcher did its work - the woman was flung over the embankment, a distance of ten feet. The train was brought up some three cars length further on, and the men ran back. They could not then do much, and they had to be away. They then had to run on time, because the regular train, also running on time, would be along ere ten minutes. Accidental Death (Part 3) They, therefore, had to leave the woman to the kind care of the people of the place, and go on, only stopping at Topsail to report by telegraph to St. John's station the melancholy occurrence. Women took up the inanimate form, life's spark flickering within, and brought it to the house of Joseph MORGAN, where every attention was given it, but only with the effect of restoring sufficient consciousness to enable the injured woman to say, \"let me lie down.\" Soon afterwards life became extinct. No time was lost by Captain NOBLE in doing his part; he had Dr. RENDELL summoned, and also called Constable LONG, of Topsail, who was in town; and directly the regular train arrived, at 4 p.m., he sent them off on a special at full speed to the scene, his own son, Mr. A.S. NOBLE, in charge. They arrived at 4.45, but too late, death having occurred nearly half an hour previously. They returned at 6 o'clock. The woman sustained no very great external injuries. There were a few slight scratches on the back of the head, and death is believed to have resulted from concussion of the brain. It may be added that Capt. NOBLE had a suitable coffin made by undertaker WHITE, which he sent out to Manuels by the regular morning train. In this coffin the remains will be interred. -- Evening Telegram, July 28. Died At Leading Tickles, July 24th, the beloved wife of Mr. John WHELAN, aged 68 years; she leaves a husband, 3 sons and 2 daughters to mourn their sad loss. Ship News Port of Twillingate.

Traitor (Part 1) (From the Evening Telegram) \"A TRAITOR!\" The Gafney From Holyrood. In last night's issue we briefly noticed the contemptible conduct of Mr. WOODFORD, one of the members elected by the people of Harbor Main last November to support the WHITEWAY or Liberal Party. When, on Wednesday evening, the rumor spread throughout the town, that this individual had turned traitor and joined the detested MORINE-GOODRIDGE faction, many people were unwilling to believe it. Although it was known by the members of the WHITEWAY Party that Mr. WOODFORD had been in communication with Mr. Moses MONROE, as far back as November last, and had secretly been (imbibing ?) the traitor principles from the Liberal renegade, Mr. W.J.S. DONNELLY, still we also were loathe to believe that there was a man in the ranks of the Liberals so depraved, so lost to all sense of shame and honor as to betray those with whom he has been allied for four years, and who are to-day undergoing the most violent persecutions at the hands of those to whom he has sold himself. Not many days ago we met this individual, who shall be hereafter known as WOODFORD THE TRAITOR FROM HARBOR MAIN, or the Gafney of Holyrood, at a meeting of the Liberal Party. Traitor (Part 2) He sat at the table of Sir William WHITEWAY, the veteran leader of that party; he entered into their discussions, he participated in their confidences, he subscribed to their policy, and he pledged unwavering loyalty to Sir William and his Party. Like his prototype Judas, he sat at the table with his best friend, and then went out and betrayed him to violent and relentless enemies. He accepted the confidence of his colleagues and then passed out and sold them. He obtained a seat in the Legislature, pledged by his constituents of Harbor Main district to uphold and stand by the Liberal Party and Sir William WHITEWAY, and he deliberately sacrificed their interests for the position of Financial Secretary, and a salary of sixteen hundred dollars per year. Well, the MORINE-GOODRIDGE faction are welcome to such an addition to their ranks. The WHITEWAY party are well rid of such trash, and it is peculiarly fitting that traitors should herd with traitors. This GAFNEY FROM HOLYROOD not only owes his seat in the Legislature to the prestige of the Whiteway Party, but he actually obtained the sum of FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS from Sir William WHITEWAY, with which to canvas the district last fall. He is today, under obligation to several members of the WHITEWAY Party, who endorsed notes on the banks for him, (which are still outstanding), and tided him over difficulties. Traitor (Part 3) A fitting companion truly is Mr. William WOODFORD for the arch ingrate and traitor, Alfred B. MORINE. It is humiliating to find, that there is in this country a native, capable of PROSTITUTING HIMSELF TO A PARTY OF THE MOST UNPRINCIPLED LOT OF POLITICIANS THAT EVER CURSED ANY LAND. No doubt Mr. WOODFORD is under the impression that he has acted well towards himself. Time will tell, however, whether he has or not. A traitor invariably meets his deserts, and as sure as there is a retributive justice abroad in the world, so sure will Mr. WOODFORD's crime not go unpunished. All honorable men will despise him, his present associates, even vile as they are, will hardly trust him when they now learn the truth of his depravity. The understanding is that Mr. WOODFORD will not go back to his constituents for re-election, but will be rewarded with a permanencey after the party, he has sold himself to, are done with him; and provided they are in a position to carry out their promises. But even a magistracy may be abolished, and it is well that Mr. WOODFORD should know it. \"Thou art a traitor! False to thy gods, thy brothers and thy father; Conspirant, 'gainst the liberties of thy country; And from the extremist upward of thy head, To the descent and dust beneath thy feet, A MOST TOAD-SPOTTED TRAITOR\" Politics (Part 1) \"A Mean Spirit of Revenge.\" The Dismissal of Assembly Doorkeepers and Messengers. During the past day or two, sufficient evidence has come to light to warrant us in saying that it was a mean and unworthy spirit of revenge and nothing else, that prompted the Tory Government to dismiss the doorkeepers and messengers of the House of Assemble - Messrs. WALSH, MUNDY, DEADY, KNIGHT and LONG. These men did nothing in the general election last fall to deserve the harshest treatment they have received at the hands of Messrs. GOODRIDGE, MORINE & Co. They were courteous, willing and faithful in the discharge of their duties - so much so that we challenge the Government to bring a single well-sustained charge against them. If they openly expressed their sympathy for the WHITEWAY party, what of that? Is it not a fact that other public officials in much more prominent positions were loud-mouthed in their support of the Tory Party? We could name half a dozen or more employees of the Customs department, who even went so far as to render themselves offensive to people who had business there, by making partisan and personal remarks about the political situation. The pusillanimous Messrs. MORINE, GOODRIDGE & Co., hadn't the courage to remove from office any prominent official, for the simple reason that they feared the latter's influence in the approaching by-elections. Politics (Part 2) They singled out poor WALSH, DEADY, KNIGHT, MUNDY and LONG, believing that these unassuming citizens could do them no political injury. but we can tell those Tory persecutors of the weak, and panderers to the strong, that the sovereign people will resent their injustice to WALSH, DEADY, KNIGHT, MUNDY and LONG, and that the electors will emphasise their resentment, too, in November next. Humble and all as those subordinates are, they would scorn to be as untruthful and deceptive, as are the vindictive faction by whom they have been thus deprived of the wherewithal to support themselves and families. But let the persecutors beware! The day of retribution is at hand. The dismissed officials will make their influence felt in the coming struggle. Their fellow-countrymen will sympathise with them, and enable them too, to teach even Messrs. GOODRIDGE, MORINE & Co. the lesson that no one, no matter how unpretentious he may be, ought to be mistreated by those in authority. Not a man among the dismissed officials, but has done more for the colony than any member of the Tory faction. What has Mr. GOODRIDGE ever done to increase the wealth of the country? What has Mr. MORINE ever done for Newfoundland, that he should be foisted into the Colonial Secretary's Office over the head of our talented and self-sacrificing fellow-countryman, Mr. BOND? Politics (Part 3) By exorbitant charges on his fishery supplies, Mr. GOODRIDGE has amassed wealth, while many a much better man at heart is to-day obliged, by mercantile oppression, to earn a miserable existence by culling fish on Mr. GOODRIDGE's premises. The men who have been dismissed from the situations they occupied in connection with the Assembly, earned those positions by hard and honest toil. Some of them are tradesmen, others fishermen. While they prosecuted their callings as such, they helped to enrich the country by the fruit of their toil. How much has Mr. Alfred B. MORINE, the present Acting Colonial Secretary, contributed to the wealth of the colony? Why, not a solitary cent! Ever since the well-deserved-inhospitality of his native province, flung him upon our shores, he has been a drone in the hive of industry here, and a barnacle upon the Ship of State, retarding her progress and doing his best to strand her upon the shoals of bankruptcy and Confederation! Newfoundlanders, what is your duty in this emergency? We once more appeal to you who are to the manor born, to rally round the banner of Liberation and Progress! The weal or woe of dear old Fatherland depends upon the issue of the by-elections. In this emergency Terra Nova expects every one of her sons to do his duty. Now then, let your watchword be: \"NEWFOUNDLAND FOR NEWFOUNDLANDERS, AND DOWN WITH TORY DESPOTISM.\" -- Evening Telegram, August 9. WOODFORD The Traitor A Candid Statement From Harbor Main. (Special to The Evening Telegram) Conception Harbor, Aug. 6. it is reported here that WOODFORD, the arch traitor, has stated that the leading men of Harbor Main district approve of his political treachery. This we declare a downright falsehood, intentionally made by \"Gafney\" to give a tint of justification to his dastardly conduct. We defy him to name even one man, who can command more than his own individual influence in this district, that has approved of his perditious action, or concurred with him in his traitorous conduct. Did the KENNEDY's, St. John's, WADES, HEARNS, COLES, BURKES, COSTELLOS, ROCHES, TILLEYS, CHURCHILLS, BRIENS, LEWISES, or the hundreds of other well-known and loyal Liberals, concur with him in his treachery? No! no!! He was bought with the glitter of office and they will show to the world how they detest, abhor him. Harbor Main district will show, when the time comes, that traitors and purchased turn coats, will not be tolerated. He is detested by all honorable men, and we blush with shame to think that he can claim our district as his birthplace; but the nation of greatest patriots gave birth to the most faithless sons and despicable traitors. Ireland produced CAREY and Harbor Main his prototype, who betrayed his compatriots and abandoned them in their death struggle for liberty. Away with him! Away with the spy and traitor, Gafney WOODFORD, the embodiment of all that is dishonorable whose name henceforth will be a byword and a reproach. New Lighthouse \"Baccalieu Lighthouse.\" The erection of the lighthouse at Baccalieu, near Herring Neck, has commenced, and several men from here and Herring Neck, have gone to the island to engage in the work. As the fishery has been so very bad and many are in want of employment, we don't see why a much larger number of men from Herring Neck especially, should not be employed at this work. Perhaps Messrs. GOODRIDGE and KNIGHT, at whose instance the choice and limited number have been employed, may be able to explain to the satisfaction of the public generally. The money for the erection of this lighthouse was provided by the WHITEWAY government during the session of 1893, but it is the Goodridge-Morine party that have the expending of it, and Messrs. Goodridge and Knight are responsible for how the work is proceeding. Drowning \"A Newfoundland Sailor Drowned.\" He Sank While Bathing at Sydney. We learn through Captain Robert FRASER of the SS. \"Coban\", that a Newfoundlander named Arch. OSMOND, who had been attached to the SS \"Louisburg\", has been very recently drowned at Sydney. He had been swimming from the International pier, took cramps and sank, and in the presence of witnesses unable to rescue him. -- Evening Telegram. The above young man was about 21 years of age and son of Mr. Abraham OSMOND Tizzards Harbor, and we sympathise with the parents and family in the sad loss thus sustained. Politics \"Sir William WHITEWAY Returns to the City in Excellent Humor for the Coming Fight.\" Sir William WHITEWAY, the ever popular Leader of the Liberal Party, returned to this city by the afternoon train, after a most enjoyable fishing trip out on the N.N. and W. railway line. He is in excellent trim for the by elections, and promises to give the Tory faction a greater thrashing this fall than they got in 1889, and in 1893. The Liberal Party are already actively preparing for the coming campaign. In a few days more, we shall be in a position to take the field, fully equipped for the fight. Candidates are ready for nomination, the \"sinews of war\" are available, and the people are warmly with us. Tory persecutors, \"look out for squalls.\" The day of retribution is at hand! -- Evening Telegram, August 7. Bank Appointments C.S. PINSENT, Esq., has been appointed manager of the Union Bank, in the place of the late J. GOLDIE, Esq. W.H. CROWDY, Esq., takes Mr. PINSENT's place. W.W. WATSON, Esq., fills the position of receiving teller. Mr. PETERS becomes accountant, his place being filled by R. DONNELLY, and Mr. C. BAYLY joins the Bank staff as junior clerk. -- Royal Gazette, August 7. Shipping News The \"Gipsy,\" J.W. OSMOND, master, arrived from St. John's Wednesday afternoon. We are indebted to Mr. OSMOND for late local papers. The English vessel, \"Clementine,\" Capt. BALL, arrived from Glasgow last Saturday with a cargo of coal and brick to the firm of E. DUDER. She had a tedious passage, being thirty-seven days left port. The schooner \"Jeanie,\" J.W. ROBERTS, master, called here Monday on her way to Labrador. She has coals and provisions and is bound as far North as Rama with supplies to the missionaries laboring on that distant part of the coast. Bequest We learn that the will of Jane Anthony EAMES of Concord, admitted to probate on Friday, July 20th, 1894, contains a bequest of $1,000 to the Right Rev. Llewellyn JONES, Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda. Child Abuse The steamer \"Fleta\" left here on Tuesday morning for Burnt Bay, having on board F. BERTEAU, Esq., JP., and Sergeant PATTEN. The Magistrate is gone there to investigate an alleged case of ill-treatment to a child who died at Burnt Bay some time age, which has recently been brought under his notice. Forest Fire During the week a forest fire was raging some distance away, said to be at Muddy Hole on the Straight Shore, and we learn that several houses there were destroyed. Fortunately the heavy rain fall of Thursday will probably put an end to it. It is to be regretted that almost every summer so much of our valuable timber land is devastated by forest fires. Religious The Rev. G.S. CHAMBERLAIN, Incumbent of Herring Neck Parish, officiated in St. Peter's Church last Sunday, morning and evening. His discourses on both occasions were deep, forcible and practicable, and appeared to be much appreciated by the large congregations. In the afternoon he conducted the Flower Service in St. Andrew's Church, which was of a most interesting character and very largely attended. The Fishery The fishery around our shores has been better the past week than it has this season. Tuesday and Wednesday some boats at Crow head got from a half to one quintal, but it was so stormy Thursday and yesterday that the fishing grounds could not be reached. Let us hope that the recent change in the weather will bring about an improvement in the fishery in this Bay generally. We learn that there has also been a slight alteration for the better about Fogo within the last week or ten days. Ship Arrival The schooner \"Spring Bird,\" Alex. NOLE, master, belonging to Mr. H.B. SPENCE, arrived here from Flowers Cove Thursday evening, bound to Harbor Grace with oil and skins. She left Flowers Cove on Monday last and on Wednesday night when off the Grey Islands, experienced very heavy weather, which burst her foresail and staysail, carried away flying jib, jib stay and taffrail, and broke in part of bulwarks. The fishery at Flowers Cove is said to be the worst for many years. Schooner has Rough Trip The schooner \"Terra Nova,\" which left here for St. John's on the 6th inst with a load of lumber from Indian Arm, and the misfortune of getting on a rock while going through Stag Harbor Run. It was very moderate weather and it is probable she was dragged on the rock by the tide. Fortunately the \"Flamingo\", Capt. SCEVIOUR was near at the time and he and his crew rendered assistance in getting the Terra Nova afloat. She had a big deck load of lumber which had to be removed, and a raft was made by the side of the schooner for the purpose. The tide was low when the vessel grounded and when it rose and the deck lightened of its burden, with the help of Mr. SCEVIOUR and his crew the Terra Nova was floated off and no damage was caused, as, fortunately, the water was very smooth all the while. The lumber was again put on deck and the craft proceeded on her course and reached ST. JOHN's the early part of this week. Deaths in House Fire A house belonging to Mr. William CURNEW, was destroyed by fire at St. Carls, (French Shore), on the 14th July and three small children were consumed in the flames. Arson \"Big Fire At Pilley's Island.\" The Work of an Incendiary. (Special to the Daily News) Little Bay, Aug. 11. On last Wednesday night, the business premises of the Notre Dame Trading Company, Pilley's Island, consisting of shop, dwelling and two stores, totally destroyed by fire. Loss estimated at twenty thousand dollars. The fire originated in the fish store, where some rinds were stored, and was the act of an incendiary. A man named George RAINES, of Sandy Cove Islands, is under arrest, charged with the crime. It appears that he confessed to Mr. STRONG, of the trading company, and Constable BISHOP at the time of arrest, that he did the deed, and, further, how he did it, by breaking a pane of glass in the store window, and throwing a lighted match in amongst the rinds. A Magisterial inquiry was held to-day. RAINES committed for trial. He admitted he had no spleen against Mr. STRONG or the Trading Company. He said the deed was suggested by another person named SNOW, who was indebted to STRONG. A warrant was issued for SNOW's arrest. The wind was high at the time of the fire, and carried flankers down on the Mining company's premises and set fire to the woods in vicinity, which, fortunately, was quickly seen and extinguished. For a time the undenominational school house stood in great danger, and no doubt, not withstanding the strenuous efforts put forth to save it, would have been consumed but for a timely change of the wind, a most fortunate change for the inhabitants of that thriving settlement, for had the school house which is built on the height overlooking the village taken fire flankers would be driven in all directions, causing probably the destruction of the whole place, and possibly worse - the loss of life. Died Drowned, on the 8th of July, at the Straits of Belle Isle, George GRIMES, of herring Neck, aged 26 years. Died On the 3rd inst., at \"Florence Glove\". Rosina Emeline, aged 44 years, wife of Henry GOODRIDGE, Esq. Died On the 5th inst., at St. John's, in the 81st year of his age, David SCLATER, Esq., a native of Saltcoats, Ayrshire, Scotland."
