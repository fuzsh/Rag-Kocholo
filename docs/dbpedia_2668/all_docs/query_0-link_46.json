        "text": "HORTON, William Tucker (1840-1926) was active as an architect in Halifax, N.S. from 1889. Born in Ivybridge, Co. Devon, England on 11 November 1840, he emigrated to Canada in 1863 and settled in Nova Scotia where he learned the building trades and worked as a carpenter and builder. From 1889 he began to describe himself as an architect, at first under his own name, and then in partnership with William T. Whiteway in 1898-1900 (see list of works under Whiteway & Horton). This partnership was dissolved in April 1900 (Halifax Herald, 10 May 1900, 4). When Whiteway moved to British Columbia, Horton joined William C. Harris, whose architectural office was located in the same building as Whiteway & Horton. Their new firm of Harris & Horton prospered, receiving major commissions for institutional, ecclesiastical, commercial and residential projects throughout Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island during the period from 1901 to 1913 (see list of works by Harris & Horton under William C. Harris).\n\nThe untimely death of W.C. Harris in July 1913 necessitated the formation of a new business, which Horton then formed with James E. Harris, a nephew of W.C. Harris. They appear to have operated two separate offices, one in Charlottetown (run by J.E. Harris), and one in Halifax (run by W. T. Horton). Virtually all of the commissions by the firm of Harris & Horton in Halifax after 1915 were designed by Horton, and this arrangement continued for the next decade until the death of Horton at the age of 86 years. He died in Halifax on 27 April 1926 (obituary Acadian Recorder [Halifax], 27 April 1926, 3; obituary Halifax Herald, 28 April 1926, 10; biog. in M. Rosinski, Architects of Nova Scotia: A Biographical Dictionary 1605-1950, 1994, 209-10).
