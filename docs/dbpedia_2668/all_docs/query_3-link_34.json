        "text": "The population reached nearly 99,000\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of North Devon increased by 5.3%, from around 93,700 in 2011 to around 98,600 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased by a smaller percentage than the overall population of the South West (7.8%), and by a smaller percentage than the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, North Devon was home to around 0.6 people per football pitch-sized piece of land. This area was the joint third-least densely populated local authority area across the South West (after West Devon and Torridge ).\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was lower in North Devon than across the South West\n\nPercentage population change, North Devon and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% South West ▲7.8% North Devon ▲5.3% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nAn older North Devon\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of North Devon increased by three years, from 45 to 48 years of age.\n\nThis area had a higher average (median) age than the South West as a whole in 2021 (44 years) and a higher average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 65 to 74 years rose by around 2,300 (an increase of 20.9%), while the number of residents between 35 and 49 years fell by around 2,100 (11.7% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 65 and 74 years increased by 1.7 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nUnpaid care in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 4.6% of North Devon residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 7.2% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in North Devon (2.6 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the South West (2.8 percentage points, from 7.5% to 4.7%). Across England, the proportion fell by 2.8 percentage points, from 7.2% to 4.4%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in North Devon decreased by 2.6 percentage points\n\nReligion in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 45.1% of North Devon residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 28.8% in 2011. The rise of 16.3 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in North Devon. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 29.3% to 44.1%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 46.7% of people in North Devon described themselves as Christian (down from 61.3%), while 6.5% did not state their religion (down from 8.6% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 45.1% of usual residents in North Devon reported having \"No religion\"\n\nNorth Devon residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 90,500 North Devon residents said they were born in England. This represented 91.8% of the local population. The figure has risen from just over 86,700 in 2011, which at the time represented 92.6% of North Devon's population.\n\nWales was the next most represented, with just over 1,300 North Devon residents reporting this country of birth (1.3%). This figure was down from around 1,400 in 2011, which at the time represented 1.5% of the population of North Devon.\n\nThe number of North Devon residents born in Scotland remained close to 1,100 between the last two census (from 1.2% of the local population in 2011 to 1.1% in 2021)\n\nIn 2021, 91.8% of North Devon residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nNational identity in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 3.2% of North Devon residents did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK. This figure increased from 2.2% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, 0.9% of residents identified with a UK and non-UK national identity, compared with 0.3% in 2011. The percentage of residents in North Devon that identified as \"British only\" increased from 14.4% to 56.4%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK was greater across the South West (1.7 percentage points, from 4.4% to 6.1%) than in North Devon (1.0 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points, from 8.2% to 10.0%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in North Devon increased by 1.0 percentage points\n\nFamily in North Devon\n\nOf North Devon households, 18.7% included a couple but no children in 2021, down from 19.9% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in six households (16.9%) included a couple with dependent children, compared with 18.2% in 2011. The percentage of single family households including a couple living with only non-dependent children increased from 5.8% to 5.9%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of households including a couple but no children in North Devon (1.3 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the South West (1.2 percentage points, from 19.7% to 18.5%). Across England, the percentage fell by 0.9 percentage points, from 17.6% to 16.8%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple without children in North Devon decreased by 1.3 percentage points\n\nMore adults never married or in a civil partnership\n\nOf North Devon residents aged 16 years and over, 30.5% said they had never been married or in a civil partnership in 2021, up from 27.8% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under one in two people (49.1%) said they were married or in a registered civil partnership, compared with 51.7% in 2011. The percentage of adults in North Devon that had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership increased from 10.0% to 10.6%.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who had never been married or in a civil partnership was greater across the South West (3.5 percentage points, from 31.1% to 34.7%) than in North Devon (2.7 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 3.3 percentage points, from 34.6% to 37.9%.\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had never married or registered a civil partnership in North Devon increased by 2.7 percentage points\n\nChange in employment\n\nOf North Devon residents aged 16 years and over, 53.9% said they were employed (excluding full-time students) in 2021, down from 56.7% in 2011.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed was greater in North Devon (2.8 percentage points) than across the South West (1.6 percentage points, from 56.9% to 55.3%). Across England, the percentage fell by 0.8 percentage points, from 56.5% to 55.7%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) in North Devon decreased by 2.8 percentage points\n\nFewer adults working long hours\n\nIn 2021, 11.7% of North Devon residents aged 16 years and over and in employment said they worked over 49 hours per week. This figure decreased from 14.9% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, around one in eight people (12.5%) said they worked 15 hours or less per week, compared with 11.0% in 2011. The percentage of adults in employment working 31 to 48 hours per week increased from 51.3% to 52.3%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week was greater in North Devon (3.2 percentage points) than across the South West (2.5 percentage points, from 13.3% to 10.8%). Across England, the percentage fell by 2.2 percentage points, from 13.3% to 11.1%.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in North Devon decreased by 3.2 percentage points\n\nChange in housing in North Devon\n\nOf North Devon households, 67.3% owned their home in 2021, down from 68.5% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just over one in five households (20.4%) rented privately, compared with 18.4% in 2011. The percentage of North Devon households that lived in a socially rented property increased from 10.8% to 11.1%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of households that owned their home was greater across the South West (1.6 percentage points, from 67.4% to 65.9%) than in North Devon (1.1 percentage points). Across England, the percentage fell by 2.0 percentage points, from 63.3% to 61.3%.\n\nThe rate of home ownership in North Devon decreased by 1.1 percentage points\n\nDisability in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 7.2% of North Devon residents were identified as being disabled and limited a lot. This figure decreased from 7.9% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot was greater across the South West (1.1 percentage points, from 8.1% to 7.0%) than in North Devon (0.7 percentage points). Across England, the proportion fell by 1.6 percentage points, from 9.1% to 7.5%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in North Devon decreased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nHealth in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 49.7% of North Devon residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 48.1% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 33.6% to 33.0%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of North Devon residents describing their health as \"very bad\" was 1.1% (similar to 2011), while those describing their health as \"bad\" was 3.9% (similar to 2011).\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in very good health in North Devon increased by 1.6 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in North Devon\n\nIn 2021, 1.2% of North Devon residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category, up from 0.8% in 2011. The 0.4 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the South West, the percentage of people from \"Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups\" increased from 1.4% to 2.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 2.3% to 3.0%.\n\nIn 2021, 97.0% of people in North Devon identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 97.9% in 2011), while 1.2% identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category (compared with 0.9% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Other\" category (\"Arab\" or \"Any other ethnic group\") increased from 0.2% in 2011 to 0.3% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 1.2% of usual residents in North Devon identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
