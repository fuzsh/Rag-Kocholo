        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Devon\n\nDevon is a popular unisex name that originates in the English language. Devon is derived from the British name Devin and means “deep valley dwellers.” This name has a rich history and is associated with stunning landscapes. It is linked to the English county of Devon in the Southwest of England and the Dumnonii, the Celtic community that inhabited Devon, Cornwall, and surrounding areas for many generations. Dumnonii could possibly mean ‘worshipers of the God Dumnonos.’ Devon could also take on the meaning of “defender,” which alludes to the Celtic people who defended their land against the invading Anglo-Saxons during the Dark Ages.\n\nThe Irish root of this masculine name is Devin. Devin may be derived from one of the two Gaelic names — Ó Daimhín or Ó Duibhín. Ó Daimhín means ‘little stag little ox,’ and Ó Duibhín means the “little black one.” Devin may also mean “divine.”\n\nThis uniquely beautiful gender-neutral name is pronounced “DEH-vən” or “də-VAHN” and has several variants, such as Davon, Deven, Devin, Devyn, and Devan. Devon also comes with several appealing nicknames, such as Dev, Von, Devvy, Devi, and Devi. Although a unisex name, Devon is more frequently used for boys. However, a myriad of girl name variations of the name exists like Deaven, Devonne, Devion, Devione, Devionne, Devone, Devoni, Devonn, Devin, Devinne, Devan, Devana, Devanna, and many more.\n\nFictional characters named Devon are present in every genre and medium and appear in several movies, TV series, books, and video games. Devon Carter is Raven’s love interest in the TV show That’s So Raven. Devon is also likable in Disney Pixar’s animated movie Turning Red.
