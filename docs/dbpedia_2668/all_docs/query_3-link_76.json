        "text": "One of the best ever TED talks! I remember watching it as part of my CPD whilst doing my teacher training. So much truth and poignant, profound wisdom. So sad that Sir Ken passed. üòî Also sad that it doesn't feel like the education system has really positively evolved to embrace these observations in the 17 years since it was recorded. Yes it's mostly about children in the education system, but isn't it also true that it could apply to the many grown up kids (adults) who have unlearned their creativity, bravery and willingness to be wrong. #education #growthmindset #PersonalGrowth #growthmindset #personaldevelopment #tedtalk #aqcroft\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôll know (what god looks like) in a minute.‚Äù Always, all ways, never can watch enough - Love this little girl‚Äôs creativity and confidence which by third grade educated into knowing one right answer when there‚Äôs our experiences (eight billion) as what‚Äôs true for each of us. (Circles have in(finite) points about a core unifying point. Plus 360-degree views or lenses) In some cases cultures don‚Äôt separate self from other - telepathy psychic abilities or sensing empathic abilities are so natural and strong - there‚Äôs an intuitive insightful awareness as a seemingly oneness because folks don‚Äôt hide shadow? This isn‚Äôt just humans. Animals. Plant medicine. Mineral medicine. Even our own body parts share this. Non-locality suggests we‚Äôre far more interesting integral and intra-connected than originally thought. Imagine. Creativity can re-visit health care (whole foods) and educational systems to include W(hole)ness and the implicate order - David Bohm. He also wrote Thought as a System. Holomorphic - where holo- means whole. SDG-0 where zero is circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è consciousness or awareness unifies.\n\nCouldn't agree more. When #learners are fixated on getting all the right answers and afraid to make mistakes in #school, their #creativity gets stifled. #Education should be a launchpad for creativity. üöÄ Encouraging creativity in the #classroom... 1Ô∏è‚É£ ...builds confidence: when learners feel safe to share their ideas and perspectives, they are more likely to participate actively in class discussions and group projects without fear of judgment. üôã‚ôÄÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ ...promotes critical thinking: when students are encouraged to think outside the box, explore unconventional ideas, and challenge the status quo, they are more likely to engage in critical thinking and develop a deeper understanding of the world. üí≠ 3Ô∏è‚É£ ...prepares learners for real-world scenarios: creative thinking is not limited to the arts but is applicable across various subjects and disciplines ‚Äî encouraging learner creativity prepares them for the challenges they will face in the real world, where innovative thinking is key to solving complex problems. üß© #k12 #k12schools #k12education #learning\n\nAs parents and educators, we need to encourage children to think creatively together and give them palettes with methods on how to learn. Rather than focusing solely on memorization and standardized tests, we should teach them how to discover the world and solve problems in their own unique ways. Let's not stigmatize children for misspellings or minor mistakes, but instead, foster a love of learning to learn and exploration. By doing so, we can help our children become innovative thinkers and problem-solvers, ready to tackle challenges that comes their way. #education #parenting #creativity #innovation #problem-solving\n\n\"If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything Original.\" Let's not forget creativity is unleashed only when you have the potential to make mistakes and correct them. #lifehack: Don't be afraid to make mistakes, however, make sure you learn from them. #unleashingcreativity #creativethinking #childrenseducation #mentoring #leadershipcoaching #unleashingpotential #mistakesarelessons\n\nEmbrace your mistakes, they are a sign of growth. As someone once said, 'If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original.' Don't be anxious about making mistakes, it means you're trying something new and taking risks. Keep pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas, even if it means making a few missteps along the way. #growthmindset #innovation\n\nValuing creativity is important in life and in the workplace. In my work at GLG, I've seen firsthand how those without \"creative professional\" on their resume bring fresh ideas to the table (my extended team excels at this - our brainstorms are epic). We aren't afraid to fail on the way to our next win. It's also a topic I discuss with my son regularly - \"how did you fail today?\" is a common after school question we ask each other. Let's recognize and encourage creativity, along with the \"failure\" it brings, because when we lose it our lives and work suffer. #creativity #workplaceculture"
