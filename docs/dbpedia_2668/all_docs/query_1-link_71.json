        "text": "Whiteway, William ___ 1599-1635 ___ British ___ merchant\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SUMMARY\n\nThere is, apparently, little information about Whiteway available on the internet. He lived in Dorset and was a merchant. His diary is largely a record of public events and news.\n\nA biography link\n\nWikipedia bio\n\nThe Diary Review - The towne took fire\n\nDIARY DATES, CONTENT DESCRIPTORS\n\n1618-1634 ___ political social\n\nWEB TEXT LINKS\n\nmany citations\n\nORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT LINKS\n\nBritish Library, Manuscript Collections\n\nSOME PUBLISHED TITLES\n\nDorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club Proceedings\n\nWilliam Whiteway of Dorchester, his diary,1618-1635\n\nDecember 2005, August 2008, April 2013\n\nPlease email if you have any corrections, additions or comments, or if you've found the site useful. Thank you.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES AND CAUTIONS: 1) The first line of basic information may be incomplete in several ways: some historical figures have different names (titles, pen-names); their birth and death dates may be unknown or uncertain (g - guess, c - circa); similarly, their occupations may be unknown, or they may have had other jobs; and, for early diarists, I've used 'British' a bit too freely. 2) The biographical summary may not be accurate. It was compiled quickly from various sources, mostly on the internet, and the facts were not checked anywhere near as rigorously as they would have been if they'd been intended for publication in a printed form. 3) The journal dates and descriptors (which are in no particular order) must be treated with caution: since I have not examined the diaries myself, the descriptors are only guesses based on bibliographies, anthologies and internet biographies. 4) For the biography and etext links, I have ignored any sites with charges, and I have avoided, wherever possible, those with pop-ups or too much advertising. I have limited myself to providing three etext links where there is some variety between them. 5) For the original manuscript links, I have limited myself to providing a maximum of two (although, for a few diarists, their original diaries are held in more than two places). 6) I have provided the titles - chosen randomly - for up to three printed editions of the diaries."
