        "text": "Canadian architect\n\nThis article is about the architect. For the politician, see William Whiteway.\n\nWilliam Tuff Whiteway (1856–1940) was a Canadian architect best known for his work in the early 1900s in Vancouver, although he received commissions in various parts of the United States and Canada during his peripatetic career.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nWhiteway was born in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland Colony in 1856.[1] He moved to Victoria, British Columbia in approximately 1882, to Vancouver in 1886, and to San Diego in 1887. In 1888, he moved to Port Townsend, Washington, where he practiced architecture with his partner Julius C. Schroeder. In 1892, he left Port Townsend for St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and then moved to Halifax where he partnered with William T. Horton. In 1900, Whiteway returned to Vancouver, where he remained until his death in 1940.[1]\n\nDuring his career he was repeatedly in conflict with the Architectural Institute of British Columbia for nonpayment of membership fees, and for undercutting the minimum fees that the Institute imposed on transactions with clients. He was also criticized by the Institute for working with an unlicensed architect, W.H. Chow, who was barred from licensing because of his race.[1]\n\nAnother element of controversy surrounds whether he truly designed the most famous work attributed to him, the World Building (now Sun Tower) of Vancouver. Another highly successful Vancouver architect of the era, George L.T. Sharp (1880–1974), has claimed the initial sketch was his, not Whiteway's.[1]\n\nNotable Commissions\n\n[edit]\n\nAll are in Vancouver unless otherwise specified; all are extant unless otherwise specified.\n\nIn chronological order:[1][2][3]\n\nSecond Ferguson Block (1887), 6 Powell Street at Carrall Street.
