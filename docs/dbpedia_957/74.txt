Giovanni Battista Piranesi

The Palazzo di Montecitorio, Rome

Rome, 1760-78

Etching with line-engraving

400 x 611 mm

The imposing 16th-century exterior of the Palazzo di Montecitorio stretches into the hazy distance. Ghostly outlines of buildings and the column of Marcus Aurelius (193 AD) shimmer in the background. The combination of classical sculpture, 16th-century architecture and the 18th century highlights the constantly evolving landscape and society of Rome. Piranesi was an Italian printmaker, designer, architect, archaeologist and theorist. His extensive output, of both art and writing, promoted a fascination with classical antiquity that was hugely influential on many artists and writers.
