Ghostly outlines of buildings and the column of Marcus Aurelius (193 AD) shimmer in the background. The combination of classical sculpture, 16th-century architecture and the 18th century highlights the constantly evolving landscape and society of Rome. Piranesi was an Italian printmaker, designer, architect, archaeologist and theorist. His extensive output, of both art and writing, promoted a fascination with classical antiquity that was hugely influential on many artists and writers.\n\nPurchased 1939 (No.39.17)"
