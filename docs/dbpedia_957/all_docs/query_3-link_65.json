        "text": "Piranesi loved to experiment and over the course of his work, he developed a range of innovative etching techniques, providing exquisite detail in his work. And although his prints are black and white, his clever use of light and texture brings great depth to his pictures.\n\nThis can be seen clearly in his series Le Vedute di Roma – a journey through the eternal city. This is a collection of views of Roman landmarks and vistas; intended as souvenirs for tourists. The collection is noted for its dramatic compositions and strong contrasts of light and shade.\n\nPiranesi’s etchings are powerfull. The buildings he depicts are immense and the people he places are tiny, giving them an insignificant character.\n\nHe frequently uses great contrasts in his drawings, for example in the cloudy sky, or shadows caused by neighboring buildings.\n\nDue to Piranesi’s training as an architect, he makes perfect use of perspective and vanishing points, creating great depth in his drawing.\n\nIn 1803, Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon’s brother and King of Naples (from 1806-1808) and later the King of Spain (from 1808-1813), donated Piranesi’s original etchings to the Ghent library.\n\nThis Piranesi collection gives you the opportunity to own prints created directly from the original editions of this renowned artist’s masterpieces.\n\nThe collection includes 138 prints (136 by Piranesi, plus one from his son Francesco Piranesi, and a map of the city)."
