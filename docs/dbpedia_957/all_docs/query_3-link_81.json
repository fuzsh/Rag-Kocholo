        "text": "Neoclassical art, a widespread and influential movement in painting and the other visual arts that began in the 1760s, reached its height in the 1780s and ’90s, and lasted until the 1840s and ’50s. In painting it generally took the form of an emphasis on austere linear design in the depiction of Classical themes and subject matter, using archaeologically correct settings and clothing. Neoclassicism in the arts is an aesthetic attitude based on the art of Greece and Rome in antiquity, which invokes harmony, clarity, restraint, universality, and idealism. In the context of the tradition, Classicism refers either to the art produced in antiquity or to later art inspired by that of antiquity, while Neoclassicism always refers to the art produced later but inspired by antiquity. Classicizing artists tend to prefer somewhat more specific qualities, which include line over colour, straight lines over curves, frontality and closed compositions over diagonal compositions into deep space, and the general over the particular.\n\nNeoclassicism arose partly as a reaction against the sensuous and frivolously decorative Rococo style that had dominated European art from the 1720s on. But an even more profound stimulus was the new and more scientific interest in Classical antiquity that arose in the 18th century. Neoclassicism was given great impetus by new archaeological discoveries, particularly the exploration and excavation of the buried Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii (the excavations of which began in 1738 and 1748, respectively). And, from the second decade of the 18th century on, a number of influential publications by Bernard de Montfaucon, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the comte de Caylus, and antiquarian Robert Wood provided engraved views of Roman monuments and other antiquities and further quickened interest in the Classical past. The new understanding distilled from these discoveries and publications in turn enabled European scholars for the first time to discern separate and distinct chronological periods in Greco-Roman art, and this new sense of a plurality of ancient styles replaced the older, unqualified veneration of Roman art and encouraged a dawning interest in purely Greek antiquities. The German scholar Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s writings and sophisticated theorizings were especially influential in this regard. Winckelmann saw in Greek sculpture “a noble simplicity and quiet grandeur” and called for artists to imitate Greek art. He claimed that in doing so such artists would obtain idealized depictions of natural forms that had been stripped of all transitory and individualistic aspects, and their images would thus attain a universal and archetypal significance.\n\nPainting\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nWestern painting: Neoclassicism\n\nNeoclassicism as manifested in painting was initially not stylistically distinct from the French Rococo and other styles that had preceded it. This was partly because, whereas it was possible for architecture and sculpture to be modeled on prototypes in these media that had actually survived from Classical antiquity, those few Classical paintings that had survived were minor or merely ornamental works—until, that is, the discoveries made at Herculaneum and Pompeii. The earliest Neoclassical painters were Joseph-Marie Vien, Anton Raphael Mengs, Pompeo Batoni, Angelica Kauffmann, and Gavin Hamilton, Those artists were active during the 1750s, ’60s, and ’70s. Each of those painters, though they may have used poses and figural arrangements from ancient sculptures and vase paintings, was strongly influenced by preceding stylistic trends. An important early Neoclassical work such as Mengs’s Parnassus (1761) owes much of its inspiration to 17th-century Classicism and to Raphael for both the poses of its figures and its general composition. Many of the early paintings of the Neoclassical artist Benjamin West derive their compositions from works by Nicolas Poussin, and Kauffmann’s sentimental subjects dressed in antique garb are basically Rococo in their softened, decorative prettiness. Mengs’s close association with Winckelmann led to his being influenced by the ideal beauty that the latter so ardently expounded, but the church and palace ceilings decorated by Mengs owe more to existing Italian Baroque traditions than to anything Greek or Roman.\n\nA more rigorously Neoclassical painting style arose in France in the 1780s under the leadership of Jacques-Louis David. He and his contemporary Jean-François-Pierre Peyron were interested in narrative painting rather than the ideal grace that fascinated Mengs. Just before and during the French Revolution, these and other painters adopted stirring moral subject matter from Roman history and celebrated the values of simplicity, austerity, heroism, and stoic virtue that were traditionally associated with the Roman Republic, thus drawing parallels between that time and the contemporary struggle for liberty in France. David’s history paintings Oath of the Horatii (1784) and Lictors Bringing to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789) display a gravity and decorum deriving from Classical tragedy, a certain rhetorical quality of gesture, and patterns of drapery influenced by ancient sculpture. To some extent these elements were anticipated by British and American artists such as Hamilton and West, but in David’s works the dramatic confrontations of the figures are starker and in clearer profile on the same plane, the setting is more monumental, and the diagonal compositional movements, large groupings of figures, and turbulent draperies of the Baroque have been almost entirely repudiated. This style was ruthlessly austere and uncompromising, and it is not surprising that it came to be associated with the French Revolution (in which David actively participated).\n\nNeoclassicism as generally manifested in European painting by the 1790s emphasized the qualities of outline and linear design over those of colour, atmosphere, and effects of light. Widely disseminated engravings of Classical sculptures and Greek vase paintings helped determine that bias, which is clearly seen in the outline illustrations made by British sculptor John Flaxman in the 1790s for editions of the works of Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante. Those illustrations are notable for their drastic and powerful simplification of the human body, their denial of pictorial space, and their minimal stage setting. That austere linearity when depicting the human form was adopted by many other British figural artists, including the Swiss-born Henry Fuseli and William Blake.\n\nNeoclassical painters attached great importance to depicting the costumes, settings, and details of their Classical subject matter with as much historical accuracy as possible. This worked well enough when illustrating an incident found in the pages of Homer, but it raised the question of whether a modern hero or famous person should be portrayed in Classical or contemporary dress. This issue was never satisfactorily resolved, except perhaps in David’s brilliantly evocative portraits of sitters wearing the then-fashionable antique garb, as in his Portrait of Madame Récamier (1800).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The poetry of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid, the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and history recorded by Pliny, Plutarch, Tacitus, and Livy provided the bulk of Classical sources, but the most important single source was Homer. To this general literary emphasis was added a growing interest in medieval sources, such as the pseudo-Celtic poetry of Ossian, as well as incidents from medieval history, the works of Dante, and an admiration for medieval art itself in the persons of Giotto, Fra Angelico, and others. Indeed, the Neoclassicists differed strikingly from their academic predecessors in their admiration of Gothic and Quattrocento art in general, and they contributed notably to the positive reevaluation of such art.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Neoclassicism coexisted throughout much of its later development with the seemingly obverse and opposite tendency of Romanticism. But, far from being distinct and separate, these two styles intermingled with each other in complex ways; many ostensibly Neoclassical paintings show Romantic tendencies, and vice versa. This contradictory situation is strikingly evident in the works of the last great Neoclassical painter, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who painted sensuous Romantic female nudes while also turning out precisely linear and rather lifeless historical paintings in the approved Neoclassical mode.\n\nBritain\n\nGavin Hamilton—Scottish painter, archaeologist, and dealer—spent most of his working life in Rome, and his paintings include two series of large and influential canvases of Homeric subjects. West and the Swiss-born Kauffmann were the most consistent exhibitors of history pieces in London during the 1760s. James Barry and Fuseli also were important. Blake, poet and painter, was a Neoclassicist to some extent.\n\nFrance\n\nAs well as being a painter, Joseph-Marie Vien was a friend of the archaeologist Caylus and a director of the French Academy in Rome. That generation also included Jean-Baptiste Greuze, who painted a few Classical history subjects as well as the scenes from contemporary life for which he is best known; Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée the Elder, like Vien a director of the French Academy in Rome; and Nicolas-Guy Brenet.\n\nThe outstanding and most influential of all French Neoclassicists and one of the major artists in Europe was Vien’s pupil Jacques-Louis David. David’s early works are essentially Rococo, and his late works also revert to early 18th-century types. His fame as a Neoclassicist rests on paintings of the 1780s and ’90s. After winning the Prix de Rome of the French Academy in 1774 (important in the history of French painting because it awarded a stay in Rome, where winners studied Italian paintings firsthand), he was in that city in 1775–81, and he returned there in 1784 to paint Oath of the Horatii. David’s contemporaries and near-contemporaries included Jean-Germain Drouais, whose history paintings almost equaled David’s own in severity and intensity.\n\nThe slightly younger generation of painters included Jean-Baptiste Regnault, Louis-Léopold Boilly, and Louis Gauffier. They were followed by a more important group that included Pierre-Paul Prud’hon, who blended in his paintings a mild Classicism and the lyrical mood and soft lights of Correggio. Prud’hon was patronized by the empresses Josephine and Marie-Louise. Baron Pierre-Narcisse Guérin painted in a style close to the Neoclassicism of David, although he was not one of David’s pupils.\n\nOf David’s pupils, three became well known and one became very famous. Baron François-Pascal-Simon Gérard had a high reputation as a portraitist under both Napoleon and Louis XVIII. Antoine-Jean Gros executed many large Napoleonic canvases and after David’s death was the leading Neoclassicist in France. Anne-Louis Girodet won a Prix de Rome but stopped painting after 1812 when he inherited a fortune and turned to writing. The famous pupil was Ingres, who was important as a Neoclassicist in his subject paintings but not in his portraits.\n\nGermany and Austria\n\nAnton Raphael Mengs was born in Aussig in Bohemia (modern Ústí nad Labem, Czech Republic) in 1728, the son of the court painter there. He was himself appointed Dresden court painter in 1745. In 1755 he met Winckelmann, and subsequently he became a prominent figure in Roman Neoclassical circles. Mengs is important both as a painter and as a theorist. Apart from him, Germany’s and Austria’s main contribution to Neoclassicism was theoretical, not practical, however. The early Neoclassicists included Cristoph Unterberger; Anton von Maron, who married Mengs’s sister; and Friedrich Heinrich Füger. After Unterberger, the most interesting painter was Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, who executed both portraits and subject pieces. He was a director of the art academy in Naples and supervised the publication of engravings of the Greek vases in the collection of Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador to Naples, who was a notable connoisseur.\n\nThe German painter Asmus Jacob Carstens worked in Berlin and was a professor at the Berlin Academy. Members of his artistic circle included the painters Karl Ludwig Fernow, Eberhard Wächter, Joseph Anton Koch (who was the most outstanding of this German group), and Gottlieb Schick.\n\nItaly\n\nOne of the earliest Neoclassicists, and one of the foremost painters of his generation in Italy, was Pompeo Batoni. His style blends Rococo with Neoclassical elements, and his work includes Classical subject pieces as well as portraits in contemporary dress, the sitter posing with antique statues and urns and sometimes amid ruins. The painter Domenico Corvi was influenced by both Batoni and Mengs and was important as the teacher of three of the leading Neoclassicists of the next generation: Giuseppe Cades, Gaspare Landi, and Vincenzo Camuccini. These artists worked mostly in Rome, the first two making reputations as portraitists, Landi especially being noted for good contemporary groups.\n\nRome was indeed the city where the principal Italian painters of the Neoclassical period were most active. One such was Felice Giani, whose many decorations include Napoleonic palaces there and elsewhere in Italy (especially Faenza) and in France.\n\nImportant painters outside Rome include Andrea Appiani the Elder in Milan, who became Napoleon’s official painter and executed some of the best frescoes in northern Italy. He was also a fine portraitist. One of his pupils was Giuseppe Bossi. Another leading Lombard painter was Giovanni Battista dell’Era, whose encaustic paintings were bought by Catherine the Great and others. Other good examples of Neoclassical decorative schemes outside Rome are in Florence at the Pitti Palace by the Florentine Luigi Sabatelli and by Pietro Benvenuti, who was born at Arezzo, and in Venice at San Marco Basilica by Giuseppe Borsato, who was born in that city and was both painter and architect. The principal Neoclassicists in the south were the Sicilians Giuseppe Velasco, who did important frescoes in palaces in Palermo, and Giuseppe Errante.\n\nOther countries\n\nThe main Danish painter who produced original Neoclassical works was Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard. Other Danish painters included Abildgaard’s and David’s pupil Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. David was very influential in Brussels, where he retired late in life. The paintings of his Belgian pupil François-Joseph Navez, for example, are pure French Neoclassicism. The two main Neoclassical artists in the Netherlands were Humbert de Superville and Jan Willem Pieneman. The principal Neoclassicist in Spain was José de Madrazo y Agudo.\n\nSculpture\n\nArchaeological investigations of the Classical Mediterranean world offered to the 18th-century cognoscenti compelling witness to the order and serenity of Classical art and provided a fitting backdrop to the Enlightenment and the Age of Reason. Newly discovered antique forms and themes were quick to find new expression.\n\nThe successful excavations contributed to the rapid growth of collections of antique sculptures. Foreign visitors to Italy exported countless marbles to all parts of Europe or employed agents to build up their collections. The accessibility of the sculpture of antiquity, in museums and private houses and also through engravings and plaster casts, had a far-reaching formative influence on 18th-century painting and sculpture. The great majority of ancient sculptures collected were Roman, although many of them were copied from Greek originals and were believed to be Greek.\n\nIn the writing of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Greek art was considered immeasurably superior to Roman. It is curious, however, how little positive influence the marbles that Lord Elgin took to England from the Parthenon in Athens had on sculpture in western Europe, although they had a great influence on scholars. The ideals of Neoclassical sculpture—its emphasis on clarity of contour, on the plain ground, on not rivaling painting either in the imitation of aerial or linear perspective in relief or of flying hair and fluttering drapery in freestanding figures—were chiefly inspired by theory and by Roman neo-Attic works, or indeed by Roman pseudo-Archaic art. The latter class of art exerted an influence on John Flaxman, who was enormously admired for the severe style of his engravings and relief carvings.\n\n“Decorum” and idealization\n\nAcademic theorists, especially those of France and Italy during the 17th century, argued that expression, costume, details, and setting of a work should be as appropriate to their subject as possible. The 18th-century Neoclassicists inherited this theory of “decorum” but, giving preference to a universal ideal, instead implemented it in restricted form—subdividing all action and expression into Classical repose, idealizing faces and bodies into Classical heroes, and transforming all costume, if any, into tight-fitting attire to avoid reference to ephemeral time.\n\nA series of monuments to 18th- and early 19th-century generals and admirals of the Napoleonic Wars in St. Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey demonstrate an important resulting dilemma: whether a hero or a famous person should be portrayed in Classical or contemporary costume. Many sculptors varied between showing the figures in uniform and showing them completely naked. The concept of the modern hero in antique dress belongs to the tradition of academic theory, exemplified by the English painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in one of his Royal Academy Discourses:\n\nThe desire for transmitting to posterity the shape of modern dress must be acknowledged to be purchased at a prodigious price, even the price of everything that is valuable in art.\n\nEven the living hero could be idealized completely naked, as in two colossal standing figures of Napoleon (1808–11) by the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova. One of the most famous of Neoclassical sculptures is Canova’s Paolina Borghese Bonaparte as Venus Victrix (1805–08). She is shown naked, lightly draped, and reclining sensuously on a couch—both a charming contemporary portrait and an idealized antique Venus.\n\nRelation to the Baroque and the Rococo\n\nClassical academic theories circulating in the Renaissance, especially in the 17th century, favoured the antique and those artists who followed in that tradition. The artists praised included Raphael, Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, and Annibale Carracci. A slightly later generation of writers added the name of the French painter Nicolas Poussin to the list. The exuberance and “fury” of the Baroque must be avoided, it was argued, because they led to “barbarous” and “wicked” works. Continuing in this tradition, Winckelmann, for example, argued that the Italian Baroque sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini had been “misled” by following nature.\n\nSuch hostility to Baroque works, however, did not immediately eradicate their influence on 18th-century artists, as can be seen in an early work by Canova, Daedalus and Icarus (1779), executed before he had been to Rome. In Canova’s tomb of Pope Clement XIV (1784–87; Santi XII Apostoli basilica, Rome), the pope, seated on a throne above a sarcophagus, is treated in a dramatically realistic style with hand raised in a forceful gesture reminiscent of papal tombs of the 17th century.\n\nAlthough the Neoclassical artists and writers expressed contempt for what they regarded as the frivolous aspect of the Rococo, there is a strong influence of French Rococo on the early style of some of the Neoclassical sculptors. Étienne-Maurice Falconet, Flaxman, and Canova all started to carve and model with Rococo tendencies, which were then gradually transformed into more Classical elements.\n\nHostile critics of Neoclassical sculpture have tended to compare such works to “a valley of dry bones.” Some artists and theorists misunderstood the advocacy of Winckelmann and his school to imitate ancient art. Winckelmann meant—as did 17th-century theorists before him, and writers such as Shaftesbury and Jonathan Richardson, who influenced him considerably—imitation to be a means of discovering ideal beauty and conveying the spirit of the original. He did not advocate servile copying of the antique or eliminating the persuasive eloquence of action and intense expression. Unfortunately, spiritless copies were made, and these led to classification of idealist works as “frigid.” In sculpture some of the important commissions regrettably resulted in this lifeless concept of Neoclassicism. Among the examples are large marbles of Christ and the Apostles (1821–42) and a bronze of St. John the Baptist (1822) by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen at the Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen. Thorvaldsen’s marbles, unlike Canova’s, are as neutral as the plaster models; indeed, the surface of the sculpture was deliberately left neutral.\n\nGestures and emotions in Neoclassical works are usually restrained to give priority to calm grandeur, spiritual nobility, and beauty. In bacchanalian scenes, the gaiety is held in check, never bursting into exuberance. In a tragic scene, Andromache does not shed a tear as she mourns the death of Hector. When Flaxman did attempt terror, as in the marble The Fury of Athamas (1790–94), the violence seems forced and unconvincing. Indeed, there exist in Neoclassical sculpture hardly any convincing images of rage. The concept of antique calmness permeated European art. Canova, with his Hercules and Lichas (1796), produced a large marble of exaggerated expression beyond his normal range and, to some extent, beyond his abilities. Like Flaxman, he was far more successful when carving images of delicate expression, which even champions of Romantic passion applauded as an aim for sculpture, an art for which they advocated expressive subtlety that triggered imagination. The sensitive viewer, they argued, would find strong expression and forceful activity in monumental freestanding sculpture illogical (i.e., marble should not writhe or fly) and gratingly theatrical.\n\nBritain\n\nProminent early British Neoclassical sculptors included John Wilton, Joseph Nollekens, John Bacon the Elder, John Deare, and Christopher Hewetson—the last two working mostly in Rome. The leading artist of the younger generation was John Flaxman, professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy and one of the few British artists of the period with an international reputation. The last generation of Neoclassicists included the sculptors Sir Richard Westmacott, John Bacon the Younger, Sir Francis Chantrey, Edward Hodges Baily, John Gibson, and William Behnes.\n\nFrance\n\nWhile Neoclassicism in France was dominated by painting and architecture, the movement did find a number of notable exponents in sculpture. These included Claude Michel, called Clodion, creator of many small vividly expressive Classical figures, especially nymphs; Augustin Pajou; and Pierre Julien. Pigalle’s pupil Jean-Antoine Houdon was the most famous 18th-century French sculptor, producing many Classical figures and contemporary portraits in the manner of antique busts. Other contemporary sculptors included Louis-Simon Boizot and Étienne-Maurice Falconet, who was director of sculpture at the Sèvres factory. The slightly younger generation included the sculptors Joseph Chinard, Joseph-Charles Marin, Antoine-Denis Chaudet, and Baron François-Joseph Bosio. The early sculpture of Ingres’s well-known contemporary François Rude was Neoclassical.\n\nCentral Europe\n\nImportant among central European sculptors early in the period was Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. Subsequent Neoclassicists included Gottfried Schadow, who was also a painter but is better known as a sculptor; his pupil, the sculptor Christian Friedrich Tieck; the painter and sculptor Martin von Wagner; and the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch.\n\nItaly\n\nThe most important Italian Neoclassicist was Antonio Canova, the leading sculptor—indeed, by far the most famous artist of any sort—in Europe by the end of the 18th century. Canova’s position in the following 20 years may be compared only to that enjoyed by Bernini in the 17th century. The differences between their careers, however, are of great importance. Only at the commencement of his career did Bernini carve gallery sculpture for princely collectors, but the majority of Canova’s works belong to this category. Both artists remained resident in Rome for most of their life, but, whereas Bernini was controlled by the popes and only rarely permitted to work for foreign potentates, Canova’s principal patrons were foreigners, and he supplied sculpture to all the courts of Europe. A fine sculptor of varying styles, including austere, sentimental, and horrific, Canova produced an extensive body of work that includes Classical groups and friezes, tombs, and portraits, many in antique dress. His pupil and collaborator Antonio d’Este is one of the more interesting of the lesser Italian Neoclassical sculptors. Other Neoclassical sculptors in Rome included Giuseppe Angelini, best known for the tomb of the etcher and architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi in the church of Santa Maria del Priorato, Rome.\n\nIn Milan, Camillo Pacetti directed the sculptural decoration of the Arco della Pace. The work of Gaetano Monti, born in Ravenna, can be seen in many northern Italian churches. The Tuscan sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini executed some important Napoleonic commissions. The marble Charity is one of the more famous examples of his later Neoclassicism. It should be noted, however, that he did not see himself as a Neoclassical artist and that he challenged the idealism that was favoured by Canova and his followers.\n\nDenmark and Sweden\n\nThe Swede Johan Tobias Sergel, court sculptor to the Swedish king Gustav III, and the Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen, who lived most of his life in Rome, were among the best-known Neoclassical sculptors in Europe. Thorvaldsen was the chief rival to Canova and eventually replaced him in critical favour. His work was more severe, sometimes even archaizing, in character, and his religious sculpture, most notably his great figure of Christ in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, exhibits a deliberately chilling sublime style that still awaits sympathetic reassessment. Among his more notable pupils was the Swedish sculptor Johan Byström.\n\nRussia\n\nBoth leading Russian Neoclassicists were sculptors. Ivan Petrovich Martos studied under Mengs, Thorvaldsen, and Batoni in Rome and became a director of the St. Petersburg Academy. His best works are tombs. Mikhail Kozlovsky contributed to the decoration of the throne room at Pavlovsk.\n\nUnited States of America\n\nApart from the painter Benjamin West, who worked almost entirely in London, the leading Neoclassicists among American artists were sculptors. William Rush produced standing Classical figures, including those formerly decorating a waterworks in Philadelphia. In the middle years of the 19th century, there came into prominence four sculptors: Horatio Greenough, who executed several government commissions in Washington, D.C.; Hiram Powers, known particularly for his portrait busts; Thomas Crawford, who did monumental sculpture; and William Wetmore Story, who lived and worked in Rome, where he was associated with several other prominent 19th-century Americans. A circle of American women sculptors working in the Neoclassical style arose in Rome in the 19th century as well—among them Harriet Hosmer, Anne Whitney, and Edmonia Lewis.\n\nDavid Irwin The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
