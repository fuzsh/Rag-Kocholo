        "text": "Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an artist, designer, and engraver from 18th century Italy, who documented classical ruins of the ancient Roman empire.\n\n.\n\nEarly Experiences\n\nBorn in the Venetian Republic, he trained as an apprentice under the supervision of his uncle Matteo Lucchesi who was the architect in charge of the restoration of old buildings.\n\nAs a draughtsman for the Venetian embassy to the Pope, Piranesi gained the opportunity to observe the spectacular architecture of Rome, built in the classical style, in close detail.\n\n.\n\nThe Famous Etchings of Piranesi\n\nHe learnt how to encapsulate scenes of the disappearing city from the past, through etching and engraving, taught to him by Giuseppe Vasi.\n\nPiranesi was so accomplished at the technique that Vasi likened it to painting. These “Vedute di Roma” or views of Rome, covered the larger part of his life’s work.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Opposition between Greek & Roman Styles of Architecture\n\nPiranesi was surrounded by a multitude of architectural influences including Baroque, Rococo, and Palladian.\n\nIn the midst of all these subsequent styles lay the remains of ancient buildings from which they originated.\n\n.\n\nThis was the period of neoclassicism when people felt the need to go back to the original aesthetics of classical Rome and Greece, which had just begun to be discovered.\n\nFrom the 1750s, a heated debate brewed between those who believed that Greek art was the ideal corrupted in Roman hands, and those who were of the opinion that Romans had further developed the Greek forms.\n\nPiranesi held a firm stand in favour of the supremacy of classical Roman architecture.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPiranesi’s Puzzling Prisons\n\nPiranesi is someone who took the rules of classicism and turned them upside down.\n\nWhat has made him famous through the ages, is a series of etchings entitled “Carceri d’Invenzione,” meaning prisons which were actually figments of his own imagination.\n\n.\n\nJust Messing Around\n\nThe fantasy landscapes of his labyrinthine stairs and bridges draw our eyes inward through a puzzling sense of mystery.\n\nThe spaces continue unfolding endlessly, in the darkness beneath the earth.\n\nHe has been quoted for his remarkable motto:\n\n‘Col sporcar si trova.’\n\nBy messing about, you discover.\n\nGiovanni Battista Piranesi\n\nThe idea that through playful experimentation you can find new ideas, explains a lot about his fanciful prisons and why they have captured our imagination for so long.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSubterranean or Subconscious\n\nPiranesi may have called these fabrications prisons but they are not to be taken as something literal.\n\nThese drawings begin to make more sense when seen as hollow spaces of our subconscious mind.\n\nJust like they take us into a subterranean maze kept intact with colossal columns, they invite us to sink beneath the surface of our conscious thinking about reality.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nYou can view Le Carceri etchings by Piranesi here.\n\n.\n\nP.S. Have a look at the Classical Scroll architectural prints & tell us what you think!\n\n.\n\nSelect your language from the ‘Translate’ menu below.\n\n."
