From an edition published after his death by his son Francesco, circa 1800. In a simple black frame, highly decorative.\n\n38.5\" h x 29\" w x .75\" d\n\nAs Piranesi became more widely known, he fitted out a space in his workshop in Palazzo Tomati to sell his works, his ‘museo’. As well as prints and books of prints, he also sold antiquities, particularly to tourists who visited Rome as part of their Grand Tour of Europe and who liked to take such objects back home with them. He found ancient ornaments during his expeditions through and around Rome. Piranesi recorded these antiquities on copper plates and published them in 1778 as Vasi, candelabri, cippi, sarcofagi, tripodi, lucerne ed ornamenti antichi (Vases, Candelabra, Urns, Sarcophaguses, Tripods, Lamps and Ancient Ornaments). These two volumes were intended for devotees and served as inspiration for artists."
