        "text": "We are excited to announce the winners of the 28th annual IDA Documentary Awards!\n\nView all the winners and nominees\n\nRenowned Illusionist, Comedian, Musician and Author Penn Jillette to Host 28th Annual Ceremony\n\nPenn Jillette We're thrilled that Penn Jillette will be hosting the IDA Awards. He is a cultural phenomenon as a solo personality and as half of the world-famous Emmy®-Award winning magic duo Penn & Teller. His solo exposure is enormous: from Howard Stern to Glenn Beck to the Op-Ed pages of The New York Times. He has appeared on Dancing With The Stars, MTV Cribs and Chelsea Lately, and hosted the NBC game showIdentity. As part of Penn & Teller, he has appeared more than twenty times on David Letterman, as well as on several other TV shows, from The Simpsons and Friends to Top Chef and Jimmy Fallon. He co-hosts the controversial series Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t!, which has been nominated for sixteen Emmy® Awards. His documentary, The Aristocrats, features 100 top comics telling their version of the world's dirtiest joke and was a 2005 official Sundance entry.\n\nArnold Shapiro to Receive Career Achievement Award\n\nArnold Shapiro The IDA will award its prestigious 2012 Career Achievement Award to producer Arnold Shapiro. Arnold is the Oscar and Emmy Award-winning producer, director, writer of the documentary Scared Straight! Among his other 150 awards are 16 Emmys including the Governors’ Award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, three Humanitas Prizes, The People's Choice Award, and the George Foster Peabody Award. Arnold has produced 33 series including CBS's Rescue 911 and Big Brother, and the current A&E hit series, Beyond Scared Straight; four CBS-TV movies, two prime time CBS drama specials, and more than 90 documentaries and specials. Arnold has produced documentary programs for CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, UPN, PBS and 14 cable networks from A&E to HBO. In previous years, IDA has bestowed its Career Achievement Award on documentary luminaries such as Sheila Nevins, Ken Burns, Albert Maysles, Haskell Wexler, Michael Moore, Errol Morris, and last year's recipient, Les Blank.\n\nSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program and Fund to Receive Pioneer Award\n\nSundance Institute's Documentary Film ProgramThe IDA's Pioneer Award will be presented to Sundance Institute's groundbreaking Documentary Film Program and Fund (DFP). Established in 2002 with a gift from the Open Society Institute with leadership support from Ford Foundation's Just Films initiative among others, the DFP is a leading creative and financial resource for contemporary-issue nonfiction filmmakers worldwide. Each year the DFP grants and awards $1-2 million to independent documentary films and conducts a portfolio of Creative Labs and Fellows programs at Sundance Resort, Sundance Film Festival and elsewhere. Under the direction of Cara Mertes, the DFP also convenes events and forges partnerships globally to draw new resources to the non-fiction field, and to amplify the use of film as a tool for impact and motivate change towards more open and equitable societies. In its ten years, the DFP has supported over 425 films including Kirby Dick's The Invisible War, Patricio Guzmàn's Nostalgia For The Light, Leonard Retel Helmrich's Position Among The Stars, Josh Fox's Gasland, Tia Lessin and Carl Deal's Trouble The Water, and Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski's Born Into Brothels.\n\nDavid France Receives Jacqueline Donnet Emerging Documentary Filmmaker Award\n\nEach year IDA recognizes the achievements of a filmmaker who has made a significant impact at the beginning of his or her career in documentary film. This year IDA will honor David France, the producer and director of one of the year’s most-acclaimed films How to Survive a Plague. Since its premiere last January at the Sundance Film Festival, award-winning journalist and New York Times best-selling author David France has received tremendous praise from critics, programmers and fellow filmmakers for his directorial debut film. Several films have been inspired by his work, including the Emmy-nominated Showtime film Our Fathers, for which he received a WGA nomination. He is at work on a major new history of AIDS, due from Alfred A. Knopf in 2014.\n\n2012 IDA Documentary Awards\n\nClick the film titles below for info on how to watch each film.\n\nBEST FEATURE AWARD\n\nSEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN (WINNER)\n\nDirector/Producer/Writer: Malik Bendjelloul\n\nProducer: Simon Chinn\n\nExecutive Producer: John Battsek\n\nRed Box Films, Sony Pictures Classics\n\nTHE CENTRAL PARK FIVE\n\nDirectors/Producers/Writers: Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, David McMahon\n\nExecutive Producer: Ken Burns\n\nFlorentine Films, Sundance Selects, PBS\n\nTHE INVISIBLE WAR\n\nDirector/Writer: Kirby Dick\n\nProducers: Amy Ziering, Tanner King Barklow\n\nExecutive Producers: Regina Kulik Scully, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, Sarah Johnson Redlich, Women Donors Network, Teddy Leifer, Sally Jo Fifer, Nicole Boxer-Keegan\n\nCo-Executive Producer: Kimball Stroud\n\nCinedigm and Docurama Films\n\nTHE QUEEN OF VERSAILLES\n\nDirector: Lauren Greenfield\n\nProducers: Lauren Greenfield, Danielle Renfrew Behrens\n\nExecutive Producers: Frank Evers, Dan Cogan\n\nCo-Producer: Rebecca Horn Black\n\nEvergreen Pictures, Magnolia Pictures\n\nWOMEN WITH COWS\n\nDirector: Peter Gerdehag\n\nProducers: Tell Aulin, Lasse Rengfelt\n\nWriters: Tell Aulin, Malcolm Dixelius\n\nExecutive Producer: Malcolm Dixelius\n\nDeep Sea Productions\n\nBEST SHORT AWARD\n\nSAVING FACE (WINNER)\n\nDirector: Daniel Junge, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy\n\nProducers: David Coombe, Daniel Junge, Alison Greenberg, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Sabiha Sumar\n\nCo-Producers: Aaron Kopp, Fazeelat Aslam\n\nSenior Producer: Lisa Heller (HBO)\n\nExecutive Producer: Sheila Nevins (HBO)\n\nHBO Documentary Films, Milkhaus, LLC, and JungeFilm, LLC\n\nGOD IS THE BIGGER ELVIS\n\nDirector/Producer: Rebecca Cammisa\n\nProducer: Julie Anderson\n\nSupervising Producer: Sara Bernstein\n\nExecutive Producer: Sheila Nevins\n\nHBO Documentary Films\n\nKINGS POINT\n\nDirector/Producer: Sari Gilman\n\nProducers: Jedd Wider, Todd Wider\n\nCo-Producer: Susannah Ludwig\n\nKings Point Documentary/Wider Film Projects\n\nMONDAYS AT RACINE\n\nDirector/Producer: Cynthia Wade\n\nProducers: Robin Honan\n\nCo-Producer: Vanessa Bergonzoli\n\nSupervising Producer: Lisa Heller (HBO)\n\nExecutive Producer: Sheila Nevins (HBO)\n\nCynthia Wade Productions\n\nOPEN HEART\n\nDirector: Kief Davidson\n\nProducers: Kief Davidson, Cori Shepherd Stern\n\nExecutive Producers: Geralyn Dreyfous, Rick Rosenthal, Nancy Stephens, Eric Dobkin, Barbara Dobkin, Sean Mewshaw, Desi Van Til, Damon Lindelof, Heidi Lindelof\n\nUrban Landscapes Productions, Whitewater Films, Believe Media\n\nBEST CONTINUING SERIES AWARD\n\nAMERICAN MASTERS (WINNER)\n\nExecutive Producer: Susan Lacy\n\nSeries Producer: Prudence Glass\n\nSupervising Producer: Julie Sacks\n\nCoordinating Producer: Junko Tsunashima\n\nTHIRTEEN in association with PBS\n\nINDEPENDENT LENS\n\nExecutive Producer: Sally Jo Fifer\n\nSenior Series Producer: Lois Vossen\n\nIndependent Television Service (ITVS) in association with PBS\n\nPOV\n\nExecutive Producer: Simon Kilmurry\n\nCo-Executive Producer: Cynthia López\n\nVP of Programming & Production: Chris White\n\nSeries Producer: Yance Ford\n\nCoordinating Producer: Andrew Catauro\n\nAmerican Documentary | POV in association with PBS\n\nBEST LIMITED SERIES AWARD\n\nON DEATH ROW (WINNER)\n\nDirector/Writer: Werner Herzog\n\nProducer: Erik Nelson\n\nCoordinating Producer: Robert Erickson\n\nExecutive Producers: Dave Harding, Amy Briamonte; Andre Singer and Lucki Stipetic (Spring Films and Werner Herzog Film); Nick Raslan (Skellig Rock); Henry Schleiff and Sara Kozak (Investigation Discovery)\n\nCreative Differences, Investigation Discovery\n\nBOMB PATROL: AFGHANISTAN\n\nExecutive Producers: Dan Cesareo, Doug DePriest, Vince DiPersio, Laura Civiello, Tim Rummel\n\nSeries Producers: Kathryn Gilbert, Joe Venafro, Keith Saunders\n\nProducers/Shooters: Joe Venafro, Christopher Whiteneck, David D'Angelo, Scott Stoneback\n\nBig Fish Entertainment for NBC/G4 Media, Inc.\n\nGEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD\n\nDirector/Producer: Martin Scorsese\n\nExecutive Producers: Scott Pascucci (Grove Street), Emma Tillinger Koskoff (Sikelia Productions), Margaret Bodde\n\nProducers: Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair\n\nSupervising Producer: Blair Foster\n\nGrove Street Pictures, Spitfire Pictures, and Sikelia Productions in association with HBO Documentary Films\n\nSLAVERY: A 21ST CENTURY EVIL\n\nDirectors: David Hickman, Tim Tate, Tom Phillips\n\nExecutive Producer: Jon Blair\n\nSeries Producer: Tim Tate\n\nAl Jazeera English\n\nTHE WEIGHT OF THE NATION\n\nExecutive Producers: Sheila Nevins, John Hoffman\n\nProducers: John Hoffman, Dan Chaykin, Sarah Teale\n\nCo-Producers: Tomek Gross, Alexandra Moss, Sonia Dulay Ricci\n\nHBO Documentary Films and the Institute of Medicine, in association with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, and in partnership with the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and Kaiser Permanente\n\nDAVID L.
