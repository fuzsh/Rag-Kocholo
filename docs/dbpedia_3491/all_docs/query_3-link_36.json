        "text": "Searching for Sugar Man won the Best Feature Award 2012\n\nThe Central Park Five\n\nDirectors/Writers/Producers: Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, David McMahon\n\nExecutive Producer: Ken Burns\n\nFlorentine Films, Sundance Selects, PBS\n\nIn 1989, five black and Latino teenagers were arrested and charged for brutally attacking and raping a white female jogger in Central Park. News media swarmed the case, calling it \"the crime of the century.\" But the truth about what really happened didn't become clear until after the five had spent years in prison for a crime they didn't commit. The Central Park Five, based on Sarah Burns' best-selling book and co-directed by her husband, David McMahon, and father, renowned doc filmmaker Ken Burns, tells the riveting tale of innocent young men scapegoated for a heinous crime, and serves as a mirror for our times.\n\nThe Invisible War\n\nDirector/Writer: Kirby Dick\n\nProducers: Amy Ziering, Tanner King Barklow\n\nExecutive Producers: Regina Kulik Scully, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, Sarah Johnson Redlich, Women Donors Network, Teddy Leifer, Sally Jo Fifer, Nicole Boxer-Keegan\n\nCo-Executive Producer: Kimball Stroud\n\nCinedigm Entertainment Group, Docurama Films\n\nFrom Oscar- and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Kirby Dick (This Film Is Not Yet Rated, Twist of Faith) comes The Invisible War, a groundbreaking investigative documentary about one of America's most shameful and best-kept secretsâ€”the epidemic of rape within the US military. The film paints a startling picture of the extent of the problem: Today, a female soldier in combat zones is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. The Department of Defense estimates that there were a staggering 19,000 violent sex crimes in the military in 2010. The Invisible War exposes the epidemic, breaking open one of the most under-reported stories of our generation, to the nation and the world.\n\nThe Queen of Versailles\n\nDirector/Producer: Lauren Greenfield\n\nProducer: Danielle Renfrew Behrens\n\nExecutive Producer: Frank Evers, Dan Cogan\n\nCo-Producer: Rebecca Horn Black\n\nEvergreen Pictures, Magnolia Pictures\n\nThe Queen of Versailles is a character-driven documentary about a billionaire family and their financial challenges in the wake of the economic crisis. With epic proportions of Shakespearean tragedy, the film follows two unique characters whose rags-to-riches success stories reveal the innate virtues and flaws of the American Dream. The film begins with the family triumphantly constructing the biggest house in America, a 90,000-square-foot palace. Over the next two years, their sprawling empire, fueled by the real estate bubble and cheap money, falters due to the economic crisis. Major changes in lifestyle and character ensue within the cross-cultural household of family members and domestic staff.\n\n*Searching for Sugar Man (winner)\n\nDirector/Producer/Writer: Malik Bendjelloul\n\nProducer: Simon Chinn\n\nExecutive Producer: John Battsek\n\nRed Box Films, Sony Pictures Classics\n\nIn the late 1960s, two celebrated producers discovered a musician in a Detroit bar, and were struck by his soulful melodies and prophetic lyrics. The producers recorded an album that they believed was going to secure his reputation as one of the greatest recording artists of his generation. In fact, the album bombed, and the singer disappeared into obscurity. But a bootleg recording found its way into Apartheid-era South Africa and, over the next two decades, it became a phenomenon. Two South African fans then set out to find out what really happened to their hero. Their investigation led them to a story more extraordinary than any of the existing myths about the artist known as Rodriguez. Searching for Sugar Man is a film about hope, inspiration and the resonating power of music.\n\nWomen with Cows\n\nDirector: Peter Gerdehag\n\nProducers: Tell Aulin, Lasse Rengfelt\n\nWriters: Tell Aulin, Malcolm Dixelius\n\nExecutive Producer: Malcolm Dixelius\n\nDeep Sea Productions\n\nSeventy-nine-year-old Britt Georgsson has devoted her entire life to cows. She's been tending them since the age of four and, despite health problems, has no intention of abandoning her strenuous work caring for her 12 pets on the rundown family farm. She often dreams about her cows and does the mucking out even though a debilitating back injury means she has to walk with a pronounced stoop. Her sister Ingrid, one year her junior, lives in a nearby village; she can't stand the cows, but nonetheless helps her sister look after the bovine family inheritance."
