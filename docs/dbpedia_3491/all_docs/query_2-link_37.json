        "text": "2/4\n\n81%\n\nGhetto (2002) The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads, etc. -- to do the subject matter justice. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 29, 2019\n\n38%\n\nGummo (1997) Like a kid acting up for attention, the wise-ass Korine wants desperately to be in your face - to offend and provoke. And he does a damn good job getting his way. If for no other reason, \"Gummo\" deserves to be seen. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 07, 2019\n\n3/4\n\n89%\n\nApplause (2009) Director and co-writer Martin Pieter Zandvliet draws inspired work from Steen. You feel her every emotion. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 07, 2016\n\n3/4\n\n81%\n\nDust (2007) I never knew dust could give me such pleasure. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 06, 2016\n\n91%\n\nHouse (1977) Movies as original as this one don't come along very often, so grab it while you can. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 06, 2015\n\n3/4\n\n78%\n\nThe Grandmaster (2013) Wong extracts magnetic performances from his two stars, and Philippe Le Sourd delivers gorgeous cinematography. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Aug 23, 2013\n\n1.5/4\n\n55%\n\nBlood (2012) The landscape cinematography is often eye-pleasing, but the script is labored, filled with clichs and never allows for character development. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Aug 09, 2013\n\n4/4\n\n94%\n\nDrug War (2012) Cars go crunch, bullets fly, blood spurts, bodies splatter and an unbelievable amount of cocaine is snorted. The climactic shootout, which goes on for 15 minutes and has an astronomical body count, is a masterpiece of its kind. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 26, 2013\n\n2.5/4\n\n58%\n\nFrankenstein's Army (2013) There's little more in the way of plot, but that's no problem. \"Frankenstein's Army\" is funny and original, with innovative costumes and set designs. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 26, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n14%\n\nThe Guillotines (2012) The plot is of little importance - the spectacular action and gorgeous landscapes and costumes are what matter. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 14, 2013\n\n1/4\n\n57%\n\nHatchet III (2013) Will there be a \"Hatchet IV''? I shudder to think about it. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 14, 2013\n\n3.5/4\n\n73%\n\nPieta (2012) The newest masterpiece of sex and brutality by South Korean wild man Kim Ki-duk. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted May 17, 2013\n\n1.5/4\n\n63%\n\nUnmade in China (2012) Why does Kofman, who co-directs with Tanner King Barklow, insist upon making the movie mostly about himself? He gets into nearly every frame, often in closeup. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted May 03, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n47%\n\nThe Lords of Salem (2012) Movies by Rob Zombie, the goth rocker turned cult filmmaker, aren't for everybody. But he couldn't care less. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 19, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n60%\n\nEddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal (2012) Despite the theme, \"Eddie\" goes easy on gratuitous gore. What we get is a cerebral horror movie and a satire of the art world. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 05, 2013\n\n1/4\n\n38%\n\nThe ABCs of Death (2012) Most are exercises in sickening bad taste, with an emphasis on human bodily functions. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 08, 2013\n\n3.5/4\n\n94%\n\nWar Witch (2012) Brutality and tenderness are a potent mix in \"War Witch.\" - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 01, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n64%\n\nFerlinghetti (2009) With Americans' civil liberties under constant threat, it's comforting to know that Ferlinghetti is still with us. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 08, 2013\n\n2/4\n\n50%\n\nMumia: Long Distance Revolutionary (2012) The doc is unapologetically one-sided, and spends more time canonizing Abu-Jamal than exploring the murder and trial themselves. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 01, 2013\n\n2/4\n\n21%\n\nMy Way (2011) Just don't expect much in the plot department. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 22, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n45%\n\nClandestine Childhood (2012) 'Clandestine Childhood'' is the impressive first feature by Argentine director Benjamn Avila. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 11, 2013\n\n3/4\n\n69%\n\nA Bottle in the Gaza Sea (2011) It raises the hope that someday, perhaps, there can be a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian minds. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 04, 2013\n\n2/4\n\n42%\n\nLet Fury Have the Hour (2011) The film is one-sided and at times unfocused, but it makes a lot of sense politically. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 14, 2012\n\n1.5/4\n\n45%\n\nWaiting for Lightning (2012) The person we want most to hear from, Way himself, is largely missing.

On the plus side is Costantini's luscious cinematography. - New York Post\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 05, 2012\n\n2/4\n\n90%\n\nSix Million and One (2011) The siblings react with humor and horror to what they discover.
