        "text": "Military sexual trauma, otherwise known as “MST,” has historically been this country’s dirty little secret, typically ignored, minimized, and forgotten. Like sweeping dust under a carpet, if it is not acknowledged, then everyone can pretend that it does not exist. Meanwhile, victims have been suffering from devastating lifelong consequences to their careers, health, relationships, and psychological well-being. Despite efforts to ignore this issue, several scandals have caught media and public attention. A major turning point in the history of MST was the 1991 “Tailhook incident,” where more than 100 Navy and Marine Corps officers were involved in sexually assaulting and harassing 83 women and 7 men while attending a Tailhook Association symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada. Initial investigation concluded that these allegations were the result of inappropriate behavior of only a few lower ranking individuals as an attempt to minimize and dismiss the whole affair. However, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Barbara S. Pope found this result unacceptable and urged the United States Secretary of the Navy Henry L. Garrett III to conduct a second investigation. The second investigation led to the resignation of two top officials for their failure to conduct a thorough investigation into the Tailhook allegations and 14 other admirals were demoted or prevented from further promotion.\n\nThe Tailhook incident brought the issue of MST into public awareness. Ever since the incident, multiple reports and studies have confirmed that MST does exist and continues to occur at alarmingly high rates across all branches of the Armed Forces. As a psychologist who works with victims of MST, I am often asked, “Why doesn’t someone do something about it?” Although some people may argue that attempts to address MST have been too slow, weak, misdirected, or insufficient, others may see a consistent and growing pattern of acknowledgment, allocation of resources, and public laws to ensure that victims of MST get the services, benefits, and respect that they deserve.\n\nThe first Public Law, 102–585, was issued in 1992 to address MST by authorizing health care services, including outreach and counseling services for 1 year, for women who have experienced sexual trauma while serving on active military duty. In 1994, Public Law 103–452 amended the law to authorize treatment to men in addition to women, so that all veterans could receive services, regardless of whether the MST was reported at the time of its occurrence or not, and with no limits on the length of the treatment. The authorized treatment was expanded to also include physical health conditions resulting from MST.\n\nIn February 2000, a new directive was issued: the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act, Public Law 106–117 (also known as the “Mill Bill”), which extended the mandate to provide treatment for sexual trauma through December 2004. In 2000, an additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) directive was issued to mandate universal screening of MST on all veterans seeking treatment at a VA center, and each VA center was mandated to have a designated MST coordinator to oversee tracking, screening, and treatment for MST. Finally, in 2004, Congress granted permanent authority to the VA to provide treatment for MST.\n\nFurthermore, in 2004, the Armed Forces committee of the U.S. Congress held a session to hear a report from the Armed Forces and the VA in regard to their response to the care of victims of sexual assault in the military. I was invited as a field representative along with a colleague, Carol O’Brian, PhD, to support lead witness Undersecretary of Health Francis Murphy, MD. Top brass from the five branches of service were also in attendance, as was a representative from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Congress was well acquainted with MST and no longer wanted to hear about reports of high prevalence rates. They wanted to see some action. They asked, “What is the Department of Defense and the VA going to do about it?”\n\nA few months later, Dr. O’Brian and I, along with three other VA representatives, were invited to participate in a Department of Defense task force to make recommendations for new policies. The task force focused on the fact that if a victim of sexual assault sought treatment, it would trigger an automatic investigation—as a result, the details of the assault would become public knowledge and the victim would have to endure the consequences. Instead, we suggested establishing a “safe haven,” where victims could receive treatment with confidentiality, while those in command would be alerted about an incident without full disclosure. The safe haven would allow victims to consult with a victims’ advocate to find out about their rights and options while maintaining their privacy. Our work was the basis for new laws sworn in by Congress in early 2005. To this day, victims have the option to make either a restricted or unrestricted report while serving in the U.S. military.\n\nSince then, the VA continues to make outreach efforts about MST to veterans, and provides training and support to clinicians throughout the VA system. The VA has established a national MST support team under the VA Office of Mental Health, with a website of resources and monthly national training calls. April is recognized as Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and the MST support team disseminates educational materials so that each MST coordinator throughout the VA system can organize outreach and education to veterans and providers. The Armed Forces has also made efforts, including implementing on-station victim advocates and Sexual Harassment/Assault Response & Prevention (SHARP) programs throughout the military.\n\nIn 2013, President Obama signed a significant piece of legislation on sexual assault in the military, preventing commanders from overturning jury convictions for sexual assault, requiring a civilian review when commanders decline to prosecute, requiring dishonorable discharge or dismissal for those convicted, eliminating the statute of limitations for courts-martial in rape and sexual assault cases, and criminalizing retaliation against victims who report an assault. In 2014, Title 38 U.S. Code was amended to include counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training.\n\nNew bills relevant to MST are currently being introduced to Congress. One such bill would require that the prosecution of sexual assault cases be conducted by a third party, outside the chain of command, for a more objective adjudication. Another bill addresses record keeping of MST so that there is more consistency in what is reported across branches. Currently, records can be destroyed after 1 to 5 years from filing. With this new bill, records would be maintained and made available for the lifetime of the victim. Thus, documentation would be available for victims of MST if and when the veteran applies for benefits (such as for a Service Connection disability claim).\n\nEfforts are also being made toward education and prevention programs within the military (e.g., mandatory sexual assault prevention training) and toward public awareness for civilians. Several newspaper articles have been released on the topic, and several films have been introduced to mainstream audiences, including the 2012 Academy Award–nominated film Invisible War, written by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering and Tanner King Barklow.\n\nAnother area of tremendous effort and resource allocation for MST has been toward treatment. However, since this country entered into war in Iraq and Afghanistan (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom) in 2003, the focus has shifted to providing effective, short-term treatment for the men and women returning from combat. The emphasis has been on treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as this is the most common diagnosis from trauma. The National Center for PTSD has partnered with the VA Office of Mental Health and the U.S. Congress to identify evidence-based treatments and then roll out massive training efforts, so that trained practitioners would be available to meet the demand of returning veterans. VA medical centers and outpatient clinics across the country established PTSD outpatient clinics, and several sites developed residential PTSD treatment programs. The VA has identified prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy as the primary first-line PTSD treatments, and every VA facility has trained providers to offer these treatments to veterans. Several other treatments are also acknowledged as evidence-based treatments, such as Seeking Safety for PTSD and substance abuse, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) also has a tremendous evidence base for treating PTSD but has not been rolled out in the VA system. The concept of PTSD has become so popular that veterans (and some providers) almost assume that if they experienced trauma and are having symptoms, then they must have PTSD. However, MST is not synonymous with a diagnosis of PTSD, nor does PTSD necessarily capture all of the symptoms or accumulative impact related to enduring this specific type of trauma.\n\nAlthough PTSD treatments may address high-frequency symptoms, such as anxiety and avoidance, and rigid thought patterns, and it is readily acknowledged that PTSD is the most common diagnosis for those who have experienced MST, there may be other aspects for MST survivors where these treatments fall short. For example, MST is by definition an interpersonal trauma and may impact relationships and sexual functioning, as well as self-esteem due to MST-specific circumstances such as injustice, lack of closure, and betrayal, to name a few. Thus, this book was conceptualized as a collection of chapters to provide clinicians a robust understanding of MST and various treatments that address different aspects common to those who have experienced MST with and without PTSD.\n\nFor example, in addition to chapters on treating PTSD resulting from MST, one chapter discusses the impact of trauma on neurobiology and human attachment, and another discusses individual and institutional betrayal. Other chapters discuss treatment for common symptom clusters, such as affect regulation, sleep disturbance, substance abuse, somatic immobilization, and issues with sexuality. There is certainly overlap among the treatments presented in this book, such as addressing cognitions, and using metaphors, imagery, and behavioral strategies; nonetheless, each brings its own nuance to the understanding and treatment of MST."
