        "text": "It’s been a pretty good 24 hours to be Claire Foy….or a Claire Foy fan. The actress picked up a SAG Award last night for her work in “The Crown,” and Monday kicks off with the news that her new movie “Unsane,” directed by Steven Soderbergh, is headed to the Berlin International Film Festival for its World Premiere.\n\nDetails about the picture are still far and few between, but we do know that it was shot on the sly last year, with Soderbergh lensing it with an iPhone. The cast is pretty intriguing too with Joshua Leonard, Juno Temple, Aimee Mullins, Amy Irving, and “Saturday Night Live” alum Jay Pharaoh rounding out the ensemble. As for the story, your guess is as good as mine, but it does seem to involve some kind of medical malfeasance, and “Unsane” has been described as a horror movie.\n\nWe’ll likely find out more soon, not just with the Berlin festival looming, but also with “Unsane” slated to open on March 23rd (which means a trailer is around the corner).\n\nAs for the rest of the Berlin International Film Festival, they’ve added another handful of new movies, including Lav Diaz‘s new “musical” (huh?) “Season Of The Devil” and José Padilha‘s “7 Days In Entebbe.”\n\nThe Berlin International Film Festival runs from February 15-25.
