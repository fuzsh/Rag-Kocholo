This year’s conference will be held virtually via the Whova conference app.\n\nBattlemind brings together a variety of experts each year to inform and educate Indiana professionals on the critical issues facing military-connected families in Indiana’s communities. Our goal for this conference is to help reduce reintegration barriers for veterans, service members and military families. We work to educate attendees on the challenges military-connected families face and also the opportunities and strengths they bring to our communities.\n\nOctober 26: Preconference ($20)\n\nParticipants can choose from a session on the intersection of substance use and suicide or a community forum on veteran homelessness. These two preconference sessions are open to all audiences. A session about VA and military benefits will be offered exclusively for the legal community.\n\nOctober 27: Battlemind to Home Summit ($45)\n\nFor more information and to register, click here.\n\nVeterans Day is Nov. 11\n\nSubmit art work\n\nHey kids!
