        "text": "At their core, most documentaries merely attempt to educate mainstream audiences about a relatively unknown aspect of life. However, there’s another branch of documentaries that exist in the hopes of carrying out a higher purpose. From documentaries about wrongly accused killers to corporate mistreatment of animals, these documentaries have sought to make a difference in the world, and more than you would think have been successful.\n\nBelow are some of the most influential documentaries that have ever been released. These films have inspired protests, changed corporate policies, and freed people from prison. Some have even gone as far as to affect real-world legislature. Forget about Emmy or Oscar wins. These documentaries have proven that the film industry can help change the world for the better.\n\n1\n\n‘Gimme Shelter’ (1970)\n\nDirected by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, this documentary about The Rolling Stones is an odd addition to this list, but it was nonetheless influential. The documentary focuses on the last week of the Stones’ 1969 U.S. tour, which culminated in the disastrous Altamont Free Concert, an event that resulted in four deaths. For a long time, it was unclear what or who exactly started this violence, but the footage in Gimme Shelter helped to clear that up. Thanks to the documentary, authorities and the public were able to see Meredith Hunter draw a gun from inside his jacket, seemingly intent on hurting the band. The film also captures Hunter being stabbed, which eventually led to his death.\n\nWhere to stream Gimme Shelter\n\n2\n\n'The Thin Blue Line' (1988)\n\nErrol Morris’ documentary about one mysterious murder and police misconduct is widely considered to be one of the greatest documentaries of all time and for good reason. The film follows the case of David Harris’ death, a teenager who many believe was killed by the hitchhiking Randall Dale Adams. However, Morris’ documentary unveils a world of misleading witness accounts, questionable testimony, and subpar police work. The film was so powerful, Adams’ case was reopened and he was released from prison approximately one year after the documentary premiered.\n\nWhere to stream The Thin Blue Line\n\n3\n\nThe ‘Paradise Lost’ Trilogy (1996 - 2012)\n\nThere are few films more disturbing than Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky’s examination of the West Memphis Three. The first documentary explores the background of the case while introducing audiences to Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin, three teenagers who were arrested and imprisoned for the murder and sexual mutilation of three prepubescent boys. The documentary’s sequel is about the conviction of the trio, and the third film follows the recent developments in the case. Paradise Lost’s influence directly led to the imprisoned and innocent men walking free after 18 years, while also connecting the murders to a new, more likely subject.\n\nWhere to stream Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills\n\nWhere to stream Paradise Lost 2: Revelations\n\nWhere to stream Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory\n\n4\n\n‘Bowling for Columbine’ (2002)\n\nArguably one of Michael Moore’s most famous documentaries, Bowling for Columbine attempts to explain the Columbine High School massacre and other violent, gun-related crimes while examining the public’s opinion of guns. The film received many awards, is largely considered to be one of the greatest documentaries of all time, and is still widely used in discussions about gun violence. In one scene, Moore asks the victims of a K-Mart shooting to ask for refunds for the bullets in their bodies. K-Mart stopped selling bullets shortly after the documentary’s premiere.\n\nWhere to stream Bowling for Columbine\n\n5\n\n‘Super Size Me’ (2004)\n\nMorgan Spurlock’s documentary about the purported effects of fast food dominated life in the 2000s for a while. Using himself as a guinea pig, Spurlock ate nothing but McDonald’s for 30 days, and the resulting documentary chronicles his increasing health problems while questioning the ethics of trading health for profit. The methods Spurlock used in his experiment were later criticized. However, six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald’s removed its super size option, and the film is still used as an argument in debates against fast food.\n\nWhere to stream Super Size Me\n\n6\n\n‘An Inconvenient Truth’ (2006)\n\nDavis Guggenheim’s documentary covers what may be the most powerful and well-known slideshow in American history. An Inconvenient Truth follows former Vice President Al Gore’s campaign to re-educate America about global warming. The film was highly praised, received several awards, and was a cultural touchstone for several years. However, it’s best known for influencing activism, public opinion, and government mandates.\n\nWhere to stream An Inconvenient Truth\n\n7\n\n‘The Invisible War’ (2012)\n\nDirected by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering and Tanner King Barklow, this documentary explores the overwhelming amount of sexual assault in the U.S. military. The Invisible War won several awards and is critically acclaimed, but it’s best known for the impact it had on advocates, lawmakers, and journalists. After the film premiered, eight women, two of which appeared in the doc, filed lawsuits against military leaders. The film led to widespread criticism of sexual assault in the military and is partially responsible for President Obama signing a bill that restructured the way the U.S. military handled sexual assault cases.\n\nWhere to stream The Invisible War\n\n8\n\n‘Blackfish’ (2013)\n\nFew documentaries about corporations have changed things as much as Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s take down of Sea World. The documentary largely focuses on Tilikum, an orca whale that’s been responsible for at least three deaths, leading to a discussion about the consequences of keeping killer whales in captivity. The disturbing documentary led to many performers cancelling their shows at Sea World properties as well as protests. The documentary is pointed to as a major reason why SeaWorld has seen declining sales.\n\nWhere to stream Blackfish\n\n9\n\n‘The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst’ (2015)\n\nAndrew Jarecki, Marc Smerling, and Zachary Stuart-Pontier’s docu-series about the mysterious Robert Durst stands as a gripping examination of one disturbing figure. However, it will likely be remembered for its role in Durst being arrested for first-degree murder. The docu-series concludes with a chilling confession from Durst, but it was an unearthed letter written by Durst to the late Susan Berman that led to the real estate heir being arrested the day before The Jinx aired.\n\nStream The Jinx on HBO\n\n10\n\n‘Making a Murderer’ (2016)\n\nLaura Ricciardi and Moira Demos’ docu-series about one Wisconsin man’s case was met with far more than critical praise. The 10-part Netflix series became a pop culture event in its own right, becoming so popular even the president had to address pardoning Steven Avery. Making a Murderer follows the legal history of Steven Avery, a man who was falsely imprisoned for sexual assault and who finds himself being accused of a murder he claims he didn’t commit soon after his release. The docu-series questions whether Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey were really responsible for these crimes.
