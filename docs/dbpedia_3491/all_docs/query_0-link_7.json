We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help in understanding how you use the Service, and may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and may be controlled through your browser settings.\n\nPixels, (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email or ad that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code).

Sharing of Information.\n\nWe share information we collect in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of parties with whom we share information, and have shared information in the past 12 months, include:\n\nService Providers. We share information with our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively “Service Providers”) that process information on our behalf. Service Providers assist us with services such as payment processing, data analytics, marketing, advertising, website hosting, and technical support. These Service Providers are prohibited from using information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes.\n\nPartners. We share information with our partners in connection with offering co-branded content and services.\n\nPromotions. Our promotions may be jointly sponsored or offered by other parties. When you voluntarily enter a promotion, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering a promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.\n\nSecurity and Compelled Disclosure. We may share information to comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We also share information to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service, the individuals involved in our films, or any third party.\n\nMerger or Acquisition.

Other Parties’ Services, Social and Video Features.\n\nOur Service includes hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, or services operated by other parties. For example, we may link to video services, such as iTunes or Netflix, in order to view our films. These services are owned and operated by other parties which may use tracking technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you.\n\nCertain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain other services, such as social networks and video services (“Social and Video Features”). Examples of Social and Video Features include “liking” or “sharing” our content, watching embedded videos using other party’s video service technology, and otherwise connecting our Service to another party’s service. If you use Social and Video Features, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on our Service or other party’s services that you use.\n\nSimilarly, if you post information on a website or social network that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Fork Films, our films, TV shows or content in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Service. Also, both Fork Films and the social network may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Service and their online services.\n\nThe information collected and stored by other parties remains subject to their policies and practices. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or privacy practices of any other parties and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.\n\n6. Your Rights and Choices.\n\nA. Accessing Your Information.\n\nYou may access, update, or remove certain information that you voluntarily submitted to us when you made a purchase through the Service by sending an e-mail to us at info@forkfilms.com. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\n\nB. Tracking Technologies.\n\nCookies. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.\n\nDo Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what website operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.\n\nAnalytics. We use analytics services such as Google Analytics and other Service Providers to help Fork Films analyze how you use the Service. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. Fork Films is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.\n\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove certain tracking technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly.\n\nC. E-mail Communications.\n\nYou can opt out of receiving certain promotional e-mails from us at any time by following the instructions as provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link or by sending an e-mail to us here with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the e-mail.

We do not knowingly “sell,” as that term is defined under the CCPA, the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.\n\n8. Data Security.\n\nWe take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our Service.\n\n9. International Transfer.\n\nWe are based in the U.S. and the information we and our Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored and used in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.

Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n\n10. Changes to this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy.

Additional Disclosures for Nevada Residents.\n\nNevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as at info@forkfilms.com."
