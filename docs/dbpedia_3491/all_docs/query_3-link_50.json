        "text": "25 Military\n\nThe Invisible War\n\nCasualties of war rage beyond the battlefield. As ranks of women in the American military swell, so do incidents of rape. An estimated 30 percent of servicewomen and at least 1 percent of servicemen are sexually assaulted during their enlistment, not by the enemy, but at the hands of fellow soldiers. With stark clarity and escalating revelations, The Invisible War exposes a rape epidemic in the armed forces, investigating the institutions that perpetuate it as well as its profound personal and social consequences.\n\nView the following Alexander Street video The Invisible War https://video-alexanderstreet-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/watch/the-invisible-war?utm_campaign=Video&utm_medium=MARC&utm_source=aspresolver\n\nTanner King Barklow, Amy Ziering, Independent Television Service, Rise Films, Chain Camera Pictures, Fork Films, . . .
