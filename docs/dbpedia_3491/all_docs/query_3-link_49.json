Basically, it's the story of a couple, and aspiring artists, dicking around in Tel Aviv. The guy is a filmmaker, hoping to make a film that blurs the lines between documentary and fiction (or some shit like that), and the girl is a poet, or a writer, or something. Their relationship is strained, and the guy falls in love with this (male) actor who is in his film. And the girl eventually fucks him. Commentary about…"
