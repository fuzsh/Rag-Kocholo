        "text": "02/11/2015 - The films by Tanner King Barklow and Gil Kofman and Tova Ascher will feature in the festival’s Main Competition and the First Features Competition, respectively\n\nThe Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival has announced the 2015 line-up for its 19th edition, including a Main Competition that showcases 18 films from 21 countries – with seven world premieres (read news) –, three international and eight European premieres, and a First Features Competition that screens 14 world and international premieres (read news). Among them, we can find two Israeli films that will have their international premieres: Lost in The White City, by Tanner King Barklow and Gil Kofman, and A.K.A. Nadia, by Tova Ascher, will feature in the festival’s Main Competition and the First Features Competition, respectively.\n\nTanner King Barklow and Gil Kofman’s US-Israeli co-production Lost in The White City, a true indie film shot in freehand, is the story of a young couple (Thomas Dekker and Haley Bennett) that arrives in Tel Aviv to take a bit of time off and do some creative work: she wants to write and he wants to develop his film ideas. Their relationship is running on the rocks and the young couple is trying to use self-definition to understand how their relationship and relationships should work. But he meets a handsome soldier and he discovers – while ignoring his alcohol problem – that his feelings about sexuality are quite controversial… The film is produced by The International Art Consortium and Picture Pending Productions.\n\nIn the other competition, Tova Ascher’s UK-Israeli co-production A.K.A. Nadia portraits Nadia (Neta Shpigelman), a 17 year old Arab girl who has just graduated from the Jewish-Arab girls' school in Jerusalem and is having a secret affair with an activist in a Palestinian Liberation Movement (Ali Suliman), who she secretly marries and joins before he is sent to England on assignment. Shortly after he is caught by the authorities, Nadia is left to her own devices, realizing that there is no option of returning to Israel, to her family. The film has been staged by 2teamproductions."
