EXCLUSIVE: Thomas Dekker and Haley Bennett will star alongside Bob Morley in the indie drama The White City, which will be co-directed by Tanner King Barklow (from the Oscar-nommed The Invisible War) and Gil Kofman. The pair previously collaborated on Unmade In China. Barklow wrote the script for White City and Kofman is producing with Moti Adiv.
