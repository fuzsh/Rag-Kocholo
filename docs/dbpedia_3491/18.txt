The film that spurred action against sexual assault in the military

2012 | Running Time: 90 minutes | Rating: NR

THE INVISIBLE WAR is a film about sexual assault in the United States Military. It features interviews with veterans from multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces who recount the events surrounding their assaults. Their stories show many common themes, such as the lack of recourse to an impartial justice system, reprisals against survivors instead of against perpetrators, the absence of adequate emotional and physical care for survivors, the unhindered advancement of perpetrators’ careers and the forced expulsion of survivors from service. The survivors and advocates featured in the film call for changes to the way the military handles sexual assault, such as shifting prosecution away from unit commanders, who often are either friends with assailants or are assailants themselves. THE INVISIBLE WAR premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Director: Kirby Dick; Producers: Amy Ziering, Tanner King Barklow; Executive Producers: Nicole Boxer, Maria Cuomo Cole, Abigail Disney, Geralyn Dreyfous, Sally Jo Fifer, Sarah E. Johnson, Teddy Leifer, Regina K. Scully, Jennifer Siebel Newsom
