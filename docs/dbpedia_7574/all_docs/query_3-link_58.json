        "text": "Archaeological excavations carried out in the yard and garden of the rectory since 1981 discovered a part of Roman town Andautonia in the area of about 3500 square metres. In the 1st and the first half of the 2nd century, when the narrower town area was restricted to the area of today’s Gradišće a necropolis occupied this position. It was a cremation necropolis with graves of various shapes situated by the main road leading to the town from the south.\n\nArchaeological situation during the excavation suggested that in the entire excavated area a layer of necropolis had been covered with a thicker flood layer on which new objects were built, and digging in for wall foundations resulted in the destruction of a number of graves. In view of the repertoire of grave finds, and Emperor Hadrian’s (117-138) money found in one of the walls, it can be assumed that this necropolis was abandoned after a bigger flood, about the end of the first quarter of the 2nd century. The original purpose of the space was then changed, and due to expansion needs of the town, several buildings were built in the area, while the southern boundary of the town was moved towards today’s Kutelo.\n\nDuring the excavation of the necropolis it was possible to locate the graveyard communication (E-W), and along it remains of tombs with wall paintings. Better-preserved\n\ngraves are found in the eastern part of the location, farther from the main road (burial in earth oval pits, a grave with wooden construction and a grave in an amphora) with supplements dating from the second half of the 1st century. Numerous materials (thin wall pottery, terra sigillata, glass and jewellery) found outside tomb units can be dated to the entire 1st and the beginning of the 2nd century, and characteristic are the coins from Tiberius (14-37) to Hadrian (117-138). Apart from the imported goods from north Italic workshops, objects of domestic production confirming pre-Roman tradition in the region were also put in tombs\n\nas supplements (latenoid pottery and jewellery, pots with cylindrical necks, etc.).\n\nClick to enlarge: Southern town necropolis (1st-2nd century)\n\nGrave supplements reflect the structure of the population, whereas tomb finds show the taste and needs of the richer\n\nstratum of the society. It is best illustrated by fragments of wall paintings from tombs, the most interesting of them being images of dancers and players from the Dionysius’s suite, also reflecting significant art achievement of their author. Excavation results in this area suggest that the entire terrain was levelled soon after the flooding layers covered the necropolis. Road level was elevated for about 0.50 metres and it became the main town street (cardo) 6.20 metres wide. This street was excavated in the rectory yard in the length of 27 metres. Along the street three buildings with porches and an access street were discovered. The discovery of Emperor Hadrian’s coin in one of the building walls confirms that the time of the construction of these walls could not be before the Emperor’s reign (117-138).\n\nThe building on the eastern side of the Roman street, whose rooms and finds suggest it was the town bath, represents the biggest excavated object in the area of Andautonia so far. Northern part of the building has been excavated in the area of 1600 m² , while the unexcavated parts spread southwards, where the geophysical research has already been carried out. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the area of the entire buildung was aproximately 2000 m².\n\nSince it was built in the first half of the 2nd century,\n\npartitions and annexes in the bath were constructed, ground level was elevated, and the roof frame system was probably changed. Foundations and lower parts of the walls of a series of rectangular rooms, corridors and canals are preserved. In the earliest phase, during the 2nd century, the building probably had bigger open yards, which was reflected in the roof frame construction, while in a later partition the change in room scheme changed the manner of roofing. According to historical events and archaeological finds it can be assumed that the construction was followed by the first demolition, which might have happened during the Marcoman wars (166-175), and that during the 3rd century the building was reconstructed and partitioned.\n\nThis is suggested by the reelevation of the main town street, and the elevation of the porch level and floors in buildings, and also the annexes and partitions made inside buildings. Some passages were sealed, while doors were built in other places of which three-part stone thresholds with grooves for double door axis. The purpose of some rectangular rooms is difficult to determine for the time being, but it is certain that the preserved semicircular pool on the northern side was used as swimming pool. This might have been the purpose of the area in the north-western part of the building where parts of a bathtub were discovered. Since Roman baths were not exclusively intended for higyenic purposes, but were also areas for fun and company, some rooms were used for this purpose. Some rooms whose function was to make this pastime as pleasant as possible had their walls painted with frescos and panelled in marble, while the floors were made of plaster, sometimes paved with brick and probably blackand- white mosaics. Finds of bigger vessels for food storage and fragments of bowls, pots, dishes and glasses testify that a part of the building was designed for food purposes. West of the Roman road a smaller building was excavated. In view of its shape and the system of construction, it can be assumed that at least in an earlier phase it was used as water container. Southern façade of a bigger building was also discovered at this site, whose remains are still underground.\n\nThe construction of this part shows urban and construction adjustment to local conditions, and, at the same time, aspiration to achieve Roman regularity. Planned designing helped attain a specific urban construction composition. Given space was determined by the direction of the main road (12° from the North), and the inclined position of the access streets following the direction of the supposed town layout. These factors along with implementation ofusual principles of the Roman construction of buildings determined the irregular appearance of this part of the town and objects themselves. When building the object east of the road, the constructor took into consideration the required deviation from the North (30°) that resulted with irregular arcade space between the road and the façade of the building.This irregularity was partially corrected by a soft break on the façade, and partially by the irregular span between the colonnade pillars that made a line of the arcade parallel with the street. Buildings on the western side are situated in the area between the main and access streets, which determined their irregular form.\n\nIn late ancient times new objects were built on the site of the demolished building of the bath and demolished buildings west of the Roman road, but the concept of space was changed. Preserved remains of walls with shallow foundations, irregularly built with lots of mortar and construction materials of the demolished bath were not enough to study the layout and the purpose of the newly constructed space or the relation of new buildings to the porch and the street. Some old walls were used as foundation for the new ones, while others were left under the floor. Semicircular pool was fitted in the new building, and from this period a part of a hypocaust - warm air heating system – was preserved.Systematic research on this site has been carried out for over 25 years, and conservation-restoration efforts have been conducted simultaneously since 1984, aimed at museological presentation, which resulted with opening of Archaeological Park Andautonia in 1994.\n\nConservation-restoration work encompasses radical drainage, conservation-restoration work on the walls and construction structures, and reconstruction of some parts. The manner of drainage, conservation and restoration was designed and implemented by academic painter and restorer Emil Pohl in line with the specific situation connected with local conditions and gradual excavation of objects. Drainage was conducted in all excavated areas. Perforated pipes were built into every room to drain precipitation waters into the permeable layer, that is, subterranean waters. Using this technique the walls remain dry so they do not crack in low temperatures. Lowering the degree of humidity is the basic condition for all conservation projects and permanent presentation to follow.\n\nConservation of walls consists of mechanical cleansing and rinsing, pointing the walls with lime cement mortar, which is similar in composition to the original, and long term treatment of the stone and mortar with slacklime-water. With this method most walls do not have to be protected during winters, and only the most sensitive parts are covered with permanent or temporary shelters. Some walls and construction structures are partially reconstructed to present construction phases as clearly as possible.\n\nPhotos:\n\nCremation grave (1st c.), partially damaged by gravel layer under the wall (2nd c.)\n\nWall and flood layer (2nd c.), over the tomb floor layer (1st c.)\n\nSouthern town necropolis (1st-2nd century)\n\nUrn with a face, pottery, height 16 cm, 2nd c.\n\nWall paintings, height 52 cm, 1st c.\n\nWall painting, showing a figure of a player, height 52 cm, 1st c.\n\nStrigils, bronze, width 7,5 cm, 2nd-3rd c.\n\nWall, rectory yard, 2nd-3rd c.\n\nPart of the Roman town in the rectory yard, 2nd-4th c.\n\nPart of the Roman town Andautonia (2nd-3rd c.)\n\nTripod for cooking on the hearth, iron, 2nd-4th c.\n\nMixing bowl, (mortarium), pottery, 2nd c.\n\nPlates, pottery, 2nd-3rd c.\n\nHypocaust, (reconstruction), rectory yard, 4th c.\n\nWall, rectory yard, 4th c.\n\nPart of the Roman town Andautonia (4th c.)\n\nDrainage sistem"
