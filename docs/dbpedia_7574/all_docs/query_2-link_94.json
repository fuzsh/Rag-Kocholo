        "text": "Forming surnames in this way was a traditional practice in many languages. The suffix –ić is typical in several other south Slavic languages (e,g, Serbian, Bosnian, Montenegrin) and is roughly equivalent to the Scandinavian –sen, (Danish, Norwegian) or –sson (Swedish, Icelandic).\n\nFather's first name (patronymic surnames)\n\nAs mentioned above, most Croatian surnames are patronymic, i.e. derived from the first name of the child's father. Here are a few common examples:\n\nAntić – child of Ante\n\nFilipović – child of Filip\n\nJurić – child of Jure\n\nStjepanić – child of Stjepan\n\nMother's first name (matronymic surnames)\n\nMatronymic surnames, albeit far less frequent, also exist in Croatian.\n\nWomen who their offspring were named after were either women who were particularly appreciated in a community or were “marked” by some more or less fortunate events, such as becoming pregnant out-of-wedlock or becoming a widow at an early age.\n\nAnić – child of Ana\n\nBabić – child of a baba (Slavic for an old woman)\n\nMarušić – child of Marija\n\nZorić – child of Zora\n\nProfessions\n\nSurnames are sometimes also constructed from the parents' profession:\n\nRibar – fisherman Ribarević – child of a fisherman\n\nKovač – blacksmith Kovač, Kovačević, Kovačić – child of a blacksmith\n\nMornar – sailor Mornar, Mornarić – child of a sailor\n\nVitez – knight Vitez, Vitezić – child of a knight\n\nThe most frequent Croatian surnames\n\nHere’s the list of the 20 most frequent Croatian surnames, according to several sources:\n\nSome facts on Horvat, the most popular Croatian surname!\n\nHorvat, the most frequent surname in Croatia, doesn’t end in –ić, but is common for a different reason: the name Horvat comes from the Croatian word Hrvat (Croat).\n\nIt was estimated that of 4.3 million Croatians more than 22,000 have the last name Horvat (according to the 2011 census). Related surnames such as Horvatinčić or Horvatić – i.e. “son of Horvat” are also not uncommon."
