        "text": "When we talk about Zagreb, we usually mention its squares with the most famous one Ban Jelačić square, but also its unique museums, among which the most popular one is the Museum of broken relationships. Then, there is the upper town (Gradec or Grič), there are Ilica Street and a vibrant Tkalčićeva ulica. Zagreb parks are the oasis of peace and relaxation, and its markets are the meeting points, but also the places to taste local products. In Zagreb, many important institutions are situated - theaters, cathedral, and churches. What a regular observer is missing is a mysterious underground world of Zagreb. Let's reveal the mystery of the tunnel Grič.\n\nA bit of history\n\nThis tunnel is related to the Second World War when the construction began (between 1943 and 1944), and in 1947, the tunnel was slightly renovated. Of course, the first and primary function was the protection during the war. After the Second World War, the tunnel was neglected, and its purpose and function were investigated. However, until the early 1990s, the tunnel was almost unusable. Then, the first rave parties began to take place in Zagreb in the tunnel Grič. Since then, the tunnel Grič got its tourist purpose, and the construction of a museum in it is planned. The tunnel again opened its doors to the visitors in 2016.\n\nA bit of the technical data\n\nThe tunnel Grič is only 350 meters long. There are two main entrances - one in Mesnička Street 19 and the other one in Radićeva Street 19. There are four exits towards Tomićeva Street or Ilica Street, but they are not yet in function. The tunnel's width is 3.5 meters, apart from its central part, where it** is up to 5.5 meters wide. Some explorers think that this is just one of the tunnels below Zagreb. Of course, the Grič tunnel** is the most famous. This pedestrian tunnel is open for visits every day from 9 am to 9 pm.\n\nA slightly different tunnel\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Grič tunnel was the place of the first rave parties in Zagreb and Croatia. An interesting space, its position (the city center itself) and good acoustics made this place a good venue for such parties. Since 2016, the tunnel has been put into operation again, and it is a part of Advent in Zagreb. During that time, a monotonous and gray tunnel becomes a colorful place, an exhibition space and a favorite spot for picture taking. Talented people every year try to brighten up the tunnel with various lights and make it interesting and exciting. During the days of Advent in Zagreb, it's really entertaining to visit this tunnel.\n\nThe tunnel is unique because it is located below Grič - the Upper Town. Above the tunnel, there is a famous Zagreb funicular, but also the Museum of broken relationships, Lotršćak Tower and Art Park. The plan is to open other exits as well as the opening of the Museum of Senses. Finally, do not confuse this tunnel Grič under the upper city of Zagreb with the Grič tunnel on the highway in Lika. I hope that these small secrets of the Grič tunnel have tackled your imagination to visit the mysterious underground world of Zagreb."
