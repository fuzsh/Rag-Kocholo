        "text": "If you hear locals saying: \"Let's meet under the clock\", there is only one place they could be referring to - Ban Jelačíć Square. It is the focal point of everyday life of Croatians. Until the 20th century this busy square was used as a marketplace called Harmica, meaning \"one thirtieth\", named after a tax levied on the products that were sold here. Subsequently, the market was moved to a nearby area Dolac, and the whole square fell into neglect. It was in a very desolate state until the end of the 1970s, when it underwent a vast reconstruction.\n\nThe central point of the square is an impressive equestrian statue of Ban Josip Jelačić (1801-1859). Ban Jelačić, one of the national heroes, was a general in the Austrian army and also the \"ban\"- the governor of Croatia. In 1848 Croatia agreed to provide military help led by Jelačić, to put down anti-Austrian revolution in Hungary. As a sign of gratitude, Croatia expected greater autonomy from Austria. The opposite became reality - Austria imposed even greater repressions upon Croatia. German became the official language in Croatian schools and the Croatian flag was banned. Even so, Jelačić remains a popular hero to this day, also being portrayed on the 20 kuna banknote. During Tito's Yugoslavia Jelačić was given a tag of a collaborator with Austro-Hungary and his statue was removed. In 1991 Jelačíć returned back to the square. His original position - with a sword risen towards the north, where Hungary laid - was changed to the South, towards a Serbian occupied town Knin.\n\nStanding in front of the Jelačić statue, look around yourself. The details of surrounding buildings are sometimes breathtaking. Most of the these grandiose buildings date back to the 19th century and are great examples of styles like Art-Nouveau, Post-modernism and Biedermeier.\n\nNow look to your left side - the big avenue is called Ilica. It is the most popular and the longest shopping street in modern Zagreb, full of international as well as local brands and small cafes. On the way towards it you will also bump into the legendary meeting point - the white clock.\n\nFacing the Jelačić Statue turn right and walk towards the other end of the square. On the way you will see the Manduševac fountain, which used to provide drinking water until the 19th century. The fountain is connected to one of the legends of the origin of the name of the city - Zagreb. In the times long forgotten, a Croatian warrior was passing by, thirsty and exhausted from a battle. He spotted a gorgeous girl named Manda and asked her to scoop up some water from the spring for him, and so she did. The spring was named after the girl, Manda - Manduševac. The city got a name from the Croatian word \"zagrabiti\", which means \"to scoop up water\".\n\nThere is also an information centre nearby the fountain."
