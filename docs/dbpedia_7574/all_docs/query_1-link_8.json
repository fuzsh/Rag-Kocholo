        "text": "Roman town Andautonia used to occupy the area of today’s Ščitarjevo village, situated about 10 kilometres southeast of Zagreb, in the period from 1st-4th century. The town was situated in the Sava plain, the area of extreme traffic importance, at the place where the Roman road Siscia-Poetovio (Sisak-Ptuj) crossed the Sava, that is, by the road which had been important even before the arrival of the Romans. As the first and the biggest urban unit of the region Andautonia shows an almost two thousand year old tradition of urban life in the Zagreb region, and in this respect represents a predecessor of Zagreb.\n\nThanks to archaeological excavations lasting from 1969 until today it is known that Andautonia stretched in the area of about 1000 m in the N-S direction and about 400 m in the E-W direction. The town had stone paved streets, sewage system, public buildings, residential areas and necropolises. The results of archaeological excavations in the Ščitarjevo area and epigraphic monuments on which Andautonia is mentioned as Municipium and Respublica Andautoniesium testify that it already had independent administration in the 1st century and in the course of 400 years was the administrative, economic-cultural and religious centre of the region stretching between the Medvednica in the north, Vukomeričke gorice in the south, the Zelina River in the east and the Samoborsko gorje in the west.\n\nClick on link to open the map: The position and the hypotesized size of the territory of the Andautonia municipium\n\nDue to natural-geographic and historical factors, it is a unique area, today’s Zagreb region, which in the Roman times was the area of the Andautonian community, with Andautonia as its urban centre.\n\nSince the destruction of Andautonia (end of 4th or beginning of 5th century) the area of this ancient town has not been reurbanised, so that the preserved objects are mostly available tothe archaeological excavation.\n\nThanks to long-range excavations and conservation restoration work, the Arcahaeological park Andautonia was opened in Ščitarjevo in 1994, with additional new contents every year and with museologically presented parts of the Roman town.\n\nŠčitarjevo and its surroundings represent a first-class cultural, historical and tourist area in close vicinity of Zagreb and Velika Gorica, situated between today’s important roads and the airport, in an almost untouched landscape of Zagrebačka Posavina. The intention of all future plans is to protect this area and present it as an unavoidable destination of Croatia’s culture tourism.\n\nPhoto:\n\nŠčitarjevo, aereal photography\n\nMuseologically presented part of the Roman town, 1st-4th c."
