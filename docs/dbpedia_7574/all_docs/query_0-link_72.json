        "text": "Gavella Drama Theatre, along with the Croatian National Theatre's Drama, stands as a unique cultural institution in Zagreb, dedicated explicitly to dramatic arts. This theater balances local Croatian plays with global dramatic classics, embracing a variety of genres and perspectives. They aim to develop shows that not only entertain but also challenge societal norms and artistic values, continuing the legacy of their founder, Dr. Branko Gavella.\n\nThe Gavella Drama Theater, originally known as the Zagreb Drama Theater, was established in 1953 by a group of young actors and directors in collaboration with the local branch of the Croatian National Theater. Their primary goal was to introduce a fresh approach to theater, distinct from the traditional productions of the parent theater.

The ensemble, comprising 38 talented actors, has recently welcomed new, younger members, adding fresh dynamics to their performances.\n\nLower Town Walking Tour\n\nThe Lower Town of Zagreb, also known as Donji Grad, is one of the two main districts in the historic heart of the Croatian capital, alongside the Upper Town (Gornji Grad).
