        "text": "Chance finds in the wider area around Ščitarjevo in the past centuries indicated the existence of a Roman settlement. At the end of the 18th century M. P. Katančić embarked on researching and keeping records of then still visible remains of the Roman architecture in the area of Gradišće, north of St. Martin’s church. He assumed that the appearance of the Roman town was an irregular hexagon, the size of 300 x 100 m, and came to the conclusion it was Andautonia.\n\nIn the 18th, 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century there were discussions about the position of the town of Andautonia because some authors (A. Krčelić, A. Blašković) thought it had occupied the territory of today’s Stenjevac, while others (M. P. Katančić, Š. Ljubić, Th. Momsen, J. Brunšmid, etc.) located it in today’s Ščitarjevo village. Ubiquity of Andautonia was no longer a discussion topic after the Emperor Maximinus’s (235-238) milestone was discovered in Jelkovec near Sesvete, in 1934. The milestonestood on the Poetovio-Andautonia-Siscia road and contained a well preserved inscription marking the distance of XXX miles from Siscia. As the distance between Andautonia and Siscia of XXVII miles is known from the Itinerarium Antonini, it was not difficult to assess that the difference of three miles corresponded to the distance between today’s Ščitarjevo and Jelkovec.\n\nArchaeological research that followed confirmed the ubiquity of Andautonia in the area of the Ščitarjevo village.\n\nFirst excavations in Ščitarjevo were conducted by I. Bojničić, in the area of Gradišće, in 1882 and 1883, where he discovered parts of architecture using the system of trenches. Since Bojničić’s excavations until 1962, when smaller excavations discovered a Roman grave in the southern part of Ščitarjevo, in the area of Kutelo, we have had at our disposal only chance finds of Roman pottery, glass, coins, stone and lead sarcophaguses, with no information about the circumstances and whereabouts of finds.\n\nIn 1969 Classical Department of the Archaeological\n\nMuseum in Zagreb embarked on archaeological excavations. Systematic excavations of small areas (cca 25m²) in almost entire assumed area of the Roman town were conducted at about 40 locations, in the period from 1969-1980. This determined the character of the town with stone paved streets, town sewage system and luxuriously equipped public and residental buildings as well as the continuity of building from 1st-4th century.\n\nIn 1981 the Archaeological Museum started excavations in the rectory yard, where parts of Roman buildings and\n\nstreets have been preserved, which have lasted until today. Simultaneously, conservation-restoration work has been conducted on the excavated architecture. Since 1994, a part of the Roman town (1st-4th century) has been museologically presented at this location as the first phase of Archaeological Park Andautonia.\n\nThe Museum of Turopolje made excavations from 1988 to 1990 in the area of Kutelo, when parts of a necropolis were discovered: some cremation graves, stone tomb and a late Roman skeleton grave, as well as the Roman road approaching the town from the southwest. In the period between 1994-1999 excavations were conducted in the area around St. Martin’s church (rectory meadow), where parts of a monumental public building from the Roman age were discovered, as well as graves dating from 11th to 18th century. From 2000 to 2006 excavations were also conducted north of St. Martin’s church, on a Roman building previously registered by geophysical shooting. In 2003 the Museum of Turopolje also conducted protection excavation in the area of the extension of the Ščitarjevo Primary School, and the work has been continued in 2007 led by the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. Parts of Roman buildings were discovered in this location, and also workshop objects and streets, while particularly interesting are late-classical graves burried in the area of a formerly demolished Roman building. Excavation in the Ščitarjevo area has been led by the experts of the Classical Department of the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb: Dr. Branka Vikić, Marcel Gorenc, Valerija Damevski (1969-1987), Dorica Nemeth-Ehrlich (1988-2007), Dora Kušan Špalj (1994-2007), and the Museum of Turopolje in Velika Gorica: Pavo Vojvoda (1988-1997), Tanja Pintarić (1998-2007).\n\nClick to enlarge: Archeological research in Ščitarjevo\n\nARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ŠČITARJEVO\n\n1.
