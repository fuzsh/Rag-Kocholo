        "text": "The territory of the administrative region of Andautonia mainly corresponds to what today is the area of the Zagreb basin. Boundaries of the mentioned territory mostly coincide with natural boundaries: the Medvednica in the north, Vukomeričke gorice in the south, the Zelina river in the east and the slopes of the Samoborsko gorje in the west. A number of major Roman roads ensured extremely good connections with the area of today’s East, Northeast and Central Europe, and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Zagreb region represents an integer area with a\n\ncharacteristic ratio of rugged and lowland parts bordering the big Sava plain with indented Sava’s meanders, numerous water-flows and communications.\n\nDue to its good traffic position, fertile plain by the river, and natural resources, this area was suitable for settlement, w hich can be traced from Paleolithic until today. The selection of the location for the settlement depended on the historical circumstances of the certain period. This area was first urbanised with the arrival of the Romans, when the town centre of Andautonia was built on the Sava, east of today’s Zagreb, and the region was connected with the system of roads, routes and bridges. Diverse in relief, this area of fertile plain, and slopes of the mountains rich with woods and rocks, and good traffic connections represented a rich economic basis for the organisation of the administrative unit. Past research has revealed a number of facts about the size and the organisation of the area, while the archaeological finds in the area confirm relatively dense population and point to different aspects of activities in ancient times. A number of local roads connecting parts of the territory and the position of numerous necropolises indicate the existence of smaller settlements and farms. Roman quarries on the slopes of the Medvednica are also well known.\n\nWhen urban centre Andautonia was built, an extremely suitable position was chosen; on the Sava, by the important prehistoric road, that is, the diverging road of the amber route used by the Romans as the shortest way to the Adriatic and Italy, as well as the main link with southern and northern parts of the province, and in the vicinity of another Roman main road of the E-W direction (Siscia-Emona), which enabled optimum communication with wider surroundings. At the same time, this position out of the intersection of main roads provided the town with greater defence security.\n\nPreserved parts of Roman town Andautonia can be found in the area of what today is Ščitarjevo village, situated in the plain by the right bank of the Sava. A part of the territory is covered with village houses while the rest is under meadows and plough-land. The Sava is known to be liable to meandering and creating new beds, and we can assume that parts of its main river flux have moved on several occasions since ancient times. This is indicated by the number of backwaters that can be seen around Ščitarjevo. It is still not clear what was Andautonia’s position in relation to the Sava. If we assume that moving to the north the Sava left a part of its bed, which can be followed south of Ščitarjevo today, the Roman Andautonia would occupy the northern bank of the Sava’s flux of that period.\n\nDirections of two Roman roads, whose traces are still visible on plough-land, which led to Andautonia from the south and the southwest, meet on the southern side of the old bed,\n\nand the direction of the excavated Andautonian street leads to the same position north of the old bed.\n\nIt clearly indicates that there was probably a crossing over the Sava at that point, which would correspond to the Katančić’s description of parts of the Roman bridge still visible at the end of the 18th century.\n\nThe location on the left bank would be historically logical, and the connection between Andautonia and the northern part of the territory considering the arrangement of the Roman communications would be much better. However, only future archaeological researches may give answers to these questions.\n\nThe core of the settlement and the earliest town area from the 1st and the first half of the 2nd century were located on the elevated position of Gradišće, north of the church and the rectory, where today are meadows and plough-land. The local graveyard is in the eastern part of the area, and a local road passes across its central part. Public and residentia buildings, parts of town streets and accumulation sewage have been discovered here dating back to 1st-4th century. In the 2nd century the town spread southwards, to the area where today are village houses and house plots, from the church to the old riverbed of the Sava, proof of which are the latest finds in the area of today’s primary school.\n\nIn the rectory yard, east of today’s village road, a layer of the necropolis (1st and the beginning of the 2nd century) and a part of the Roman town have been excavated, situated by the stone paved Roman street of the N-E direction built when the town was spreading. Parts of the street have also been discovered at today’s schoolyard, and its traces can be followed in the southern part of the village near the old backwater.\n\nNecropolis from the period of 2nd-4th century has been discovered in the southern part of Ščitarjevo, at the Kutelo position, by the already mentioned Roman road leading to Andautonia from the southwest.\n\nArchaeological excavation has provided less information about the size and the appearance of the town in the 4th century. Walls and parts of architecture from that period discovered at Gradišće and in the rectory yard are partially built on foundations of earlier objects and indicate the demolition of certain parts of the town at the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century.\n\nDue to Andautonia’s importance as and urban, administrative, governing, economic and cultural centre, special attention during the field inspection has been paid to Andautonia’s suburban area in the close vicinity of Ščitarjevo.\n\nA number of elements of ancient urbanisation is still visible in the area between the Sava in the north and the east, and line Petina-Selnica-Črnkovec-Lekneno in the south and line Petina-Kosnica-the Sava in the west.\n\nThanks to the fact that this part of Posavina is sparsely builtup, in the entire area the almost untouched landscape still keeps traces of urban life from almost 2000 years ago.\n\nDense layout of main and local roads representing access town roads has been discovered, and a number of superficial finds indicates farm buildings, smaller settlements or travelling stations, and necropolises.\n\nClick to enlarge: The urban and suburban area of Andautonia with accessed roads\n\nBased on reconnaissance, air shots and finds of milestones in Jelkovec it was possible to determine the N-S direction of the road, which is Siscia-Poetovio main road. Part of this\n\nroad has been researched and presented within the town area of Andautonia, in the centre of Ščitarjevo. Gravel traces of the S-W direction of the road are visible in the stretch from Ščitarjevo to Črnkovec, and the air shots show its trace farther on to Bapče (the necropolis) and Velika Gorica (the necropolis). A part of the road was determined during the excavations at Kutelo, and geophysical research in the southern part of Ščitarjevo and in Črnkovec, where a gravemound from the Roman times stands out on plough-land just by the road. A road accessing Andautonia from the west can be seen today in the landscape and at the air shots, and west from Obrezina there is a conspicuous high gravel embankment stretching for about 300 metres.\n\nAccording to the position of other roads and facilities we can assume the existence of another 3 roads, that is, accesses from southeast, northeast and northwest.\n\nLocal roads enabled farms and quarries on the slopes of the Medvednica to be included in this network, while the direction and parts of Roman division into plots are traceable in the direction of some Roman roads and parts of routes used nowadays as well.\n\nVery dense superficial finds on plough-land south of Ščitarjevo and all the way to Črnkovec point to objects commonly located by ancient urban centres. Character of superficial finds indicates that south of the town area we can expect to find trade and artisan facilities, suburban villas, and port facilities indicated by the altar of river god Savus, found at Savišće.\n\nThe town of Andautonia can be perceived exclusively in a unique context of narrower highly urbanised town centre and outlying area with accompanying limitation of ancient ager and the mentioned outlying facilities. This unique historical area is mostly comprised of preserved urban elements of the town of Andautonia together with access Roman roads, necropolises and individual farms preserved in the immediate neighbourhood of the town.\n\nPhotos:\n\nGradišće, Ščitarjevo, aereal photography\n\nSavišće, Ščitarjevo, aereal photography\n\nŠčitarjevo, centre, aereal photography\n\nPart of the Roman street and bath, rectory yard, 3rd-4th c.\n\nRoman street, rectory yard, 3rd-4th c.\n\nRoman street, detail, rectory yard, 3rd-4th c.\n\nThe urban and suburban area of Andautonia with accessed roads\n\nBrick with a footprint, lenght 43 cm, 2nd-3rd c."
