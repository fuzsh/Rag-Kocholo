        "text": "This post is edited from last year’s A to Z post on Zagreb. It’s not a crime to plagiarize yourself!\n\n“I have always wanted peace all my life. That is why I did what I did.”\n\nIvan (Ivica [Ee-VEETS-ah]) Vranetić, 1926-3 February 2010\n\nWhen planning out my 2015 theme last year, I couldn’t find an I entry for some reason. There are obviously a number of Righteous Among the Nations and other heroes of the Shoah whose forenames and surnames started with I, but I just couldn’t find one whose story spoke to me. Now I realise it was hashgacha pratit (Divine Providence) at work, so I could spotlight the heroic Ivan Vranetić again, and the beautiful story of a love that knew no bounds.\n\nIvan Vranetić, a Catholic, was born in Vrbas, Bosnia, and grew up in the spa town of Topusko, Croatia. He was raised with a love of humanity and instinct to do the right thing. At age 17, in 1943, he began helping Jewish refugees released by partisans from a camp on Rab Island. Topusko was very pro-Ustashi, but Ivica was one of the righteous Croatians who would have no part of these foul, fascist fiends’ repulsive, racist ideology.\n\nWhen Ivica tried to help a Jewish doctor struggling with a heavy load, a soldier beat him so badly he lost the hearing in his left ear. But that didn’t stop him, and he continued finding hiding places, leading people to safety, and providing food, clothes, medicine, and other necessities. Sometimes he had to carry children and the elderly on his back as they trekked to safety. He also served in the partisans.\n\nArna Montilio, Copyright http://www.yadvashem.org/, Use consistent with fair use doctrine\n\nOne of the people Ivica saved was Arna Montilio, a young widow whose husband was murdered in Jasenovac. He also saved Arna’s mother and infant daughter. After the liberation, he kept in contact with many of the people he’d saved, including Arna. They were in love, but their mothers disapproved. Arna remarried and moved to Israel with her mother and daughter, having two more children.\n\nIn 1963, Arna’s second marriage ended in divorce. By this time, her mother had passed away. Arna wrote to Ivica, who came to Israel to see her. After so many years, their love was rekindled, and they were finally married. Theirs was a love which knew no bounds, a love which was worth waiting for.\n\nIn 1970, Yad Vashem honoured Ivica as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. In 1986, he was elected chairman of the organisation, a position he held for over 20 years.\n\nIn 2009, Ivica and six Shoah survivors were honoured at a Yad Vashem memorial ceremony, at which the former Pope Benedict XVI was also a guest. Ivica reported he felt as excited as a little boy to be meeting the Pope.\n\nIvica is buried in Tel Aviv.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis post is dedicated to the memory of Ivan Vranetić, and all the other real-life Zvonkos and Mirsadas.\n\nSt. Mark’s Church, image by Alexander Klink.\n\nSculpture representing the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, image by Pudelek (Marcin Szala).\n\nBird’s-eye view of Central Zagreb, image by Ex13, Multi-license with Creative Commons CC-BY-SA-2.5 and older versions (2.0 and 1.0).\n\nZagreb, Croatia’s capital, is the nation’s only city with over a million people. It’s nestled among the southern slopes of Medvednica Mountain and the Sava River. The city was first settled by Romans in the first century CE, as Andautonia, and was first called Zagreb by 1094. Old Zagreb has existed since the Middle Ages, while New Zagreb began to take shape during the 18th century.\n\nThough the city was besieged by Mongols and Tatars during the 13th century, the invaders were soon fought off. Because of the city’s incredible defensive walls, Zagreb also managed to escape Ottoman conquest in the 16th century, a fate which befell many other places in Southeastern Europe and Hungary.\n\nOne of Zagreb’s oldest surviving landmarks is St. Mark’s Cathedral, in St. Mark’s Square. The cathedral was built as early as the 13th century. On the church’s northwest wall is Zagreb’s oldest coat of arms, engraved in 1499. An earthquake in 1901 leveled much of the historic city.\n\nCroatian National Theatre, image by w:User:Lokksi.\n\nUptown Zagreb, image by MyName (Hrga (talk)).\n\nI have never written about Zagreb to date, but my characters Zvonimir Borković (Zvonko) and Mirsada Vuletić might’ve been there. Zvonko is 36 as of mid-March 1944, the first time he appears. He was captured in 1942 and sent to Oswiecim as a political prisoner for his anti-Ustashi partisan activities. Zvonko is the Blockältester (Block elder) to Samuel and Jozef Roblensky, Lazarus von Hinderburg, and Isaac Schulmann.\n\nZvonko hides on a pile of corpses when the Nazis evacuate the camp in January 1945, and in late February goes to a refugee centre in Kraków with four Hungarian sisters, the youngest of whom Samuel saved from certain death upon her arrival. Zvonko doesn’t want to live among former Ustashis and their collaborators, both active and silent. He’ll only go home to find his wife and three sons, and then leave again.\n\nZvonko and his family will appear in my planned book Bittersweet Hope, the story of Samuel’s spinster aunt Etke and her adopted teen daughter Tecia after the War. Zvonko, Mirsada, and their boys Tomislav, Dragomir, and Ljubomir end up in the same DP camp, and ultimately go to Pittsburgh. Zvonko and Mirsada have a daughter while in the camp, Bogdana.\n\nZvonko shows up again much later, as a very old man, in Saga VI of Cinnimin, in 1998, visiting Samuel in Cape May and in Boston for the bar mitzvah of one of Jozef’s grandsons. He totally tells off Daphne for her disrespectful, self-centred behaviour, though she typically doesn’t want to hear it. In Boston, he tells off Daphne’s almost-as-bad older sister Karyn and her best friend Kristen.\n\nMuseum of Arts and Crafts, image by Kristine Riskær (Flickr: Zagreb, Croatia 2009).\n\nMosque and Islamic centre, image by Suradnik13.\n\nSince I was 16, I’ve had reason to suspect I have some Serbian blood mixed in with my Slovak blood. And for many years, I was extremely anti-Croatian. They were beasts to the Serbian people during WWII, so much so that even the Nazis thought the Ustashis were sadistic barbarians. And many Croatians on the far Right today deny what really happened, or try to seriously downplay the atrocities and numbers of the butchered. Even some people in the Croatian diaspora have engaged in historical revisionism and celebrated Ante Pavelić, the head butcher.\n\nMain entrance of Zagreb Cathedral, image by Suradnik13.\n\nBut it’s not fair to be against an entire group of people based on what some of them did decades ago. Even if many Croatians of that generation were active or silent Ustashi collaborators, there were brave people who took a stand, like my fictional Zvonko and Mirsada, and like this guy:\n\nIvan (Ivica [Ee-VEETS-ah]) Vranetić, 1926-3 February 2010.\n\nIvan Vranetić, a Catholic by birth, was born in Vrbas, Bosnia, and grew up in the spa town of Topusko. He was raised with a love of humanity and instinct to do the right thing. At age 17, in 1943, he began helping Jewish refugees released by partisans from a camp on Rab Island, in spite of how his town was very pro-Ustashi. When he tried to help a Jewish doctor, a soldier beat him so badly he lost the hearing in his left ear. But that didn’t stop him, and he continued saving lives and serving in the partisans.\n\nOne of the people Ivica helped was a young widow named Arna Montilio, whose husband was murdered in Jasenovac. He also saved Arna’s mother and her infant daughter. After the War, he kept in contact with many of the people he’d saved, including Arna. They were in love, but their mothers disapproved. Arna remarried and moved to Israel with her mother and daughter, having two more children.\n\nIn 1963, her second marriage ended in divorce. By this time, her mother had passed away. Arna wrote to Ivica, who came to Israel to see her. Their old love survived, and they were finally married. In 1970, Yad Vashem honoured Ivica as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. In 1986, he was elected chairman of the organisation, a position he held for over 20 years. He’s buried in Tel Aviv.\n\nYou can never tell, based solely on someone’s name, religion, race, ethnicity, or nationality, what s/he’s like. There are good and bad people in every group, even when there are times when the majority or the most vocal members aren’t behaving very nicely. I took these pictures in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem as evidence that some people you might least suspect did the right thing.\n\nClick image for the Hadži-Mitkovs’ story.\n\nClick image for the Bartulovićs’ story.\n\nClick image for the Hardagas’ story.\n\nUltimately, we’re all citizens of Planet Earth. Superficial things like borders, languages, races, nationalities, and religions don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. When it all boils down, we’re just people.\n\nMy atlas was a present from my late uncle in 1986. Sometimes it’s frustrating to not have modern maps, with modern borders and names, but the same basic information is the same. That atlas represents the world as it was when my uncle was alive, a world frozen in time. Names and borders may change, but it’s still the same Earth, with the same people.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
