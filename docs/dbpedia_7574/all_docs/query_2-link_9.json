        "text": "Why is Zagreb the capital of Croatia?\n\nZagreb, the capital of Croatia, ranks among the oldest cities in Central Europe.\n\nIt is evident from the documents dating back to 1094, when a diocese was established in this area.\n\nThe history of Zagreb dates back to the Roman period.\n\nAt the time, the city was established as an urban settlement known as Andautonija.\n\nIn 1904, the name Zagreb was established by the Zagreb Chapter Diocese.\n\nIt became a free royal city in 1242, and in 1851, Janko Khamau became its first mayor.\n\nIn 1945, it was officially declared the capital of Croatia.\n\nToday, Zagreb is the largest city in the country.\n\nZagreb was developed between the Sava and the mountain of Medvednica.\n\nIts old center is situated in the medieval Gradec, which is the home of the Croatian Parliament and the Archbishop.\n\nThe medieval spirit of Gradec continues to live in its streets as you walk through the district.\n\nGas lamps still remain lit throughout the evening.\n\nAfter passing through the Stone Gate (Which was built in the 13th century), you'll reach the Croatian Parliament.\n\nThis building, which is a mix of gothic and Romanesque styles, has a roof that features vibrant tiles depicting the Kingdom of Croatia and Zagreb.\n\nFollowing the unification of the villages and the city in the 19th century, the construction of various public facilities such as parks and squares increased very fast.\n\nToday, the city is regarded as one of the most \"green\" European cities because of the many parks that were made.\n\nThe Croatian capital of Zagreb attracts visitors with the lively atmosphere of its streets, numerous coffee shops, restaurants and shopping.\n\nIf you are looking for a break on your way to, or from the Croatian coast, then Zagreb is the place to come to and it is waiting for you.\n\nIf you want to read more on what is Zagreb Famous for -> Read more here"
