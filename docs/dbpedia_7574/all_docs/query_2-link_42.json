        "text": "1989 - 2021\n\nDecember 25, 1989 at a meeting of the founding committee of the Zagreb Stock Exchange, which was attended by representatives of banks from then The Socialist Republic of Croatia (constituent republic and federated state of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and the Association of Persons and Property Insurance Croatia (today Croatia osiguranje/Croatia Insurance Company), it was decided to launch an initiative to establish a joint stock company Zagreb Capital Market, to establish a list of the first potential founders and start its business activities.\n\nApril 19, 1990, the Agreement on the Establishment of the Zagreb Capital Market was signed, and on April 18, 1991, the Assembly of the Zagreb Capital Market was held.\n\n31 May 1991, the Yugoslav Securities Commission approved the start of operations of the Zagreb Stock Exchange, ie the Zagreb Capital Market.\n\nOn July 5, 1991, the Zagreb Stock Exchange was officially registred.\n\n1992, the first financial instruments were listed - bonds of the companies Arenaturist from Pula and Jadranka from Mali Lošinj and shares of Elcon from Zlatar Bistrica.\n\nMarch 30, 1992, the first transaction was concluded - bonds of the company Jadranka from Mali Lošinj were traded.\n\nThe Varaždin Securities Market was founded on 18 February 1993, which will be merged with the Zagreb Stock Exchange in 2007.\n\nIn 1992, the Zagreb Stock Exchange started conducting public auctions on behalf of the Croatian Privatisation Fund, using new auctions software support developed by the Exchange.\n\nThe first trading system on the Zagreb Stock Exchange required the physical presence of brokers, who were situated in a trading room during an auction, directly submitting and shouting their bids to actually trade. The auction was run by an auction leader, with bids and offers and transactions entered into a computer so that all relevant data could be displayed on monitors positioned around the hall. Only one security could be traded at any given time.\n\nIn order to reduce trading costs and simplify the trading process, in March 1994 the Exchange introduced its first electronically distributed trading system: TEST-1 (Telecommunication Trading System). For the first time, the system enabled members to trade directly from their offices, using a personal computer with a modem. Although they traded from their offices, members had a simple means of finding out what the supply and demand on the Exchange. It was done by establishing a connection with the central computer located at the Exchange premises and accepting a data package with all bids/offers and transactions. Trade was order driven and for the first time a considerably larger number of securities could be traded simultaneously and every day. The system was developed by the Zagreb Stock Exchange, and its main feature was the fact that it was available at the time when Croatia’s communication infrastructure was still underdeveloped.\n\nThanks to the support of CARNET, the first Internet provider in Croatia, the Zagreb Stock Exchange has presented general information about the Exchange as well as regular daily trading reports with price movements on its official website since the beginning of 1995.
