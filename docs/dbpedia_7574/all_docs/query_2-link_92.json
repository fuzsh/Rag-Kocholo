        "text": "Wondering where to stay in Zagreb? This vibrant city, the capital of Croatia, is not only a political and cultural hub but also a place brimming with history, style, and a variety of neighborhoods each offering a unique experience.\n\nChoosing the right area in Zagreb can enhance your visit, whether you’re looking for historical charm, bustling nightlife, or serene parks.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the top neighborhoods in Zagreb, highlighting their pros and cons based on your travel preferences, budget, and duration of stay.\n\nPlus, we’ve handpicked the best hotels and apartments in each area to simplify your planning.\n\nNestled between the hill of Kaptol and the undulations of Gradec, the oldest part of Zagreb, Upper Town, invites you to a waltz with history dating back to the 11th century.\n\nThe neighborhood is a delightful melting pot of multicultural influences, thanks to the southern European immigrants and Mediterranean settlers who made Zagreb their home.\n\nStroll through quaint streets, adorned with pastel hued 17th and 18th-century edifices, leading you towards the heart of the area – Trg bana Jelacica, the main square.\n\nA leisurely uphill amble from the square, and you’re amidst the bustle of the daily Dolac food market. Frequented by locals, the market unfurls an intriguing slice of Croatian life as you sip your coffee in a charming local cafe.\n\nSpot the twin spires of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary while approaching the market. This architectural marvel harks back to the 13th century and was painstakingly restored after an earthquake.\n\nVenture east, and you’ll find yourself in Tkalciceva, a bohemian haven chock-full of quaint coffee shops, indie cafes, and a buzzing nightlife, ensuring the Croatian style of bohemianism is just a sip or bite away.\n\nFor the adrenaline junkies, the Gric Tunnel awaits. Once an air raid shelter and storage area, it has been reincarnated as Zagreb’s newest tourist draw.\n\nThe cherry on top is the rich bouquet of museums the Upper Town hosts. Don’t miss out on the Museum of Broken Relationships, the quirkiest museum you’ll ever visit, or the Mestrovic Studio, showcasing the work of Croatia’s famous sculptor Ivan Mestrovic.\n\nFeast your eyes on the colorful roof of St Mark’s Church, depicting the ancient coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia. Nearby you’ll find the Croatian Parliament, the presidential palace, and the Gallery of Naïve Art.\n\nAs night falls, Upper Town transforms into a vibrant hub with an eclectic mix of bars and clubs, including Confusion, E11EVEN Club, and City Rhythm, promising unforgettable nights.\n\nAccommodations are a touch premium in this popular part of Zagreb, with private rentals rounding out the options.\n\nEither a part of Upper Town or a standalone, depending on who you ask, Kaptol skirts Upper Town’s top border, with both districts intertwining seamlessly.\n\nHistorical records from 1094 show Kaptol as an ecclesiastical settlement. It, along with Gradec, was one of the two separate towns that merged in the 19th century to form part of burgeoning Zagreb.\n\nKnown for its breathtaking Gothic Cathedral and 25 diocese manors from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, Kaptol offers a unique, time-traveling experience.\n\nIt’s also a shoppers’ paradise with a profusion of souvenir shops, a modern shopping mall in Nova Ves, and a growing gastronomy scene catering to the increasing number of visitors. Search for Restauracia Kupecka Basta, it’s the no1 restaurant in tripadvisor and it holds that position for a reason.\n\nWhen you’re in the mood for some downtime, you’ll find ample green spaces perfect for idyllic picnics.\n\nAs twilight descends, the cafes, bars, and restaurants around Kaptol spring to life. For those seeking more action, Tkalciceva Street is a mere downhill stroll away.\n\nAlthough hotels are limited, there’s no shortage of hostels and private accommodations ranging from cozy studios to lavish villas.\n\nLocally known as Donji Grad, Lower Town, one of Zagreb’s 17 districts and also the city center, extends from Trg Jelacica Square to the main train station.\n\nIn contrast to Upper Town’s narrow lanes, Lower Town boasts almost boulevard-style wide streets, flanked by the majestic architecture of the Austria-Hungarian era and early 20th-century secession-style frontages.\n\nThe district is punctuated by impeccably maintained gardens and tree-lined streets, collectively known as the Green Horseshoe, which stretches from the train station to the National Theatre in Trg Marsala Tita.\n\nA paradise for museum lovers, Lower Town shelters seven museums, including the Mimara Museum with over 3,750 exhibits, the Ethnographic Museum showcasing Croatian culture, and the Archaeological Museum, home to the largest coin collection in Europe.\n\nArt aficionados will be spellbound by the Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters, the National Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Pavilion of Zagreb, all offering a broad sweep of artistic expressions.\n\nA respite from the city’s hustle can be sought in the Green Horseshoe squares or Maksimir Park, one of Europe’s oldest, hosting a zoo with 275 different wildlife species.\n\nWhen the sun sets, Lower Town sparkles with an array of bars, nightclubs, and restaurants. Accommodation options are also plenty, featuring a mix of luxury hotels, budget hostels, and self-catering apartments.\n\nPicture a bustling city square nestled on Ilica Street, in the western periphery of the Lower Town’s Ban Jelačić Square. It’s not your typical district but rather a vibrant gathering spot – welcome to the British Square!\n\nThis lively place, radiating a charm that bewitches both locals and travelers, serves as the heart of one of Croatia’s last authentic farmers’ markets. Imagine indulging your senses in the hustle and bustle, where the aroma of fresh fruits, vegetables, and cheese floats in the air, as chefs from across the city engage in a lively exchange with vendors to bag the finest products for the day’s culinary delights.\n\nThe festivities of the daily market commence with the crack of dawn, around 6 am, and wind down by 1 pm. As the morning fades, locals set the stage, purchasing their daily ration of fresh produce.\n\nBut that’s not all the British Square is known for. The square is the pivot for many bus and tram routes across the city. The cafes and coffee shops encircling the square become an irresistible lure for weary travelers, city explorers, and locals, offering a sweet pause for refreshment.\n\nTime your visit right and a Sunday at British Square will reward you with a flea market teeming with antiques and collectibles, a treasure trove where you can unearth unique keepsakes from your time in Zagreb.\n\nTake a walk down memory lane on a Thursday evening (subject to changes) at the ‘Old School Night’. Hosted by the local ‘Tom Tom‘ cult club, this event celebrates the nostalgia of classic and vintage automobiles while screening videos about Zagreb’s traffic history.\n\nFor the caffeine lovers and snack munchers, there’s Eliscaffe… or is it Eli’s cafe? Honestly, who knows how to pen it down, but who cares when their coffee game is this strong? These folks are practically married to their beans.\n\nNext in line, Kava Tava! If you’re like me and sometimes want more than just a liquid hug in a cup, this is your spot. Their “Cinkice” (think a unique twist on American pancakes) and “Toastic” (a gourmet take on the classic club sandwich) will have your taste buds dancing.\n\nThe beauty of British Square? It’s nestled amid a generous smattering of hotels and apartments, just a short stroll away.\n\nPost-WWII, Zagreb expanded across the River Sava into what is now known as Novi Zagreb. Originally intended as housing for the masses in socialist Yugoslavia, the district sprouted numerous tower blocks that continue to grace its skyline today.\n\nOver time, Novi Zagreb evolved from being a cluster of concrete high-rises to a vibrant residential area with modern shopping malls, boutique stores, cozy cafes, and a wide range of restaurants and bars.\n\nIts architectural evolution saw the emergence of edifices like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), Zagreb’s first significant museum in over a century. The MCA, with its vast 14,500 square-meter footprint, hosts modern art from the 1920s and works from renowned Croatian abstract-geometric artists of the 1950s.\n\nStreet art enthusiasts, head to the Dugave neighborhood to admire Zagreb’s vibrant murals and the Street Art Museum. If a leisurely day at a park is more your speed, visit Bundek Park with its serene lake, or The Park of the Newlyweds, a favorite among children.\n\nRetail therapy, you say? Check out the Arena shopping center or the Avenue Mall, and don’t miss the Hrelić flea market on Sundays for some unique souvenir hunting.\n\nNightlife in Novi Zagreb offers a variety of restaurants and bars, catering to every age and taste. The array of accommodation options, cheaper than their city center counterparts, make this area an ideal base for budget travelers.\n\nIf you’re wondering where to hang your hat in Zagreb with kids in tow, consider Jarun. A small village turned bustling neighborhood, Jarun is an oasis amidst the city, providing the perfect antidote to museum and market fatigue for your young explorers.\n\nBack in the 1980s, when Zagreb was preparing to host the 1987 Universiade (an international student multi-sport event), a sprawling man-made lake was created in Jarun, leading to the birth of Lake Jarun, a recreational marvel of today.\n\nThe lake now forms the centerpiece of a public park, with its pebbled beach, quaint shops, cafes, and a myriad of watersports, offering an irresistible seaside charm. You can opt for swimming, windsurfing, kayaking, or even a relaxed ride on a pedalo.\n\nLand-based activities are aplenty too, with extensive trails for horse riding, cycling, jogging, and hiking.\n\nAs the sun dips, the northeast corner of Lake Jarun awakens, with a vibrant nightlife featuring bars, nightclubs, and the renowned Aquarius Club. The lake is also the venue for the annual three-day music festival, INmusic.\n\nScattered around Jarun are shops, restaurants, and a range of accommodation options, making this neighborhood a great family-friendly choice. And the cherry on top? It’s just a 15-minute tram ride from the city center.\n\nNestled within the heart of Zagreb, Maksimir beckons with its enchanting mix of residential charm and commercial vitality. This district expands from the bustling Kvaternik Square in the southwest to the arterial junctions of Maksimirska Street, Bukovacka Street, and Svetice Street.\n\nThe area is studded with landmarks such as the University Hospital of Zagreb campus, the national football stadium – the home ground of NK Dinamo, and most notably, the Maksimir Park.\n\nStepping into Maksimir Park feels like stepping into a fairy tale. A treasured local retreat since 1794, it is among the world’s oldest public parks. Stroll through a vast expanse of 780 acres flourishing with century-old oak trees, shimmering lakes, meandering streams, and open meadows. This is the serene hideaway you need from the city’s buzz, a spot where children can run wild and adults can unwind.\n\nNestled within the park, you’ll find historic gems like the 1843 Bellevue Pavilion, the Echo Pavilion, or Lantern Temple, a quaint Swiss-style cottage, and the St Juraj Chapel, all standing alongside numerous intriguing sculptures.\n\nAdd a dash of wild wonder to your visit by exploring the Zagreb Zoo at the park’s southern edge. Home to more than 275 diverse species of aquatic creatures and animals, it’s a thrilling sight for all ages.\n\nMaksimir boasts a delightful array of accommodations, bars, eateries, cafes, and shops. Just a quick tram ride away from the city center, Maksimir is perfect for those yearning for a stay that strays from the trodden tourist paths.\n\nWhile searching for the perfect place to stay in Zagreb, don’t overlook the airport hotels. These lodgings are often priced competitively compared to city center hotels, offering significant savings.\n\nOne of the appealing aspects of staying near Zagreb’s airport is the sheer convenience. Imagine exiting the airplane and being able to drop off your luggage in your room within 20 minutes! A quick cab ride later, and you’re toasting to your Croatian adventure in under an hour.\n\nStaying near the airport eliminates the pre-departure morning rush, allowing for a leisurely last evening in town without worrying about the early airport run. Rise, shine, and within 20 minutes, find yourself at departures, ready to relish a leisurely breakfast before your flight.\n\nFurthermore, with the airport merely a 20-minute transfer away from central Zagreb, you’re never too far from the city’s vibrant heart, with a variety of shuttles, cabs, buses, or trams at your disposal.\n\nSo when plotting your Zagreb trip, consider airport hotels. They might just be the perfect launch pad for your Croatian journey.\n\nAh, the timeless charm of Zagreb! After spending ample time in both Upper Town and Lower Town, here’s my take on the ongoing debate.\n\nUpper Town, with its storied lanes, holds a special place in my heart. There’s a certain allure to this part of the city that reminds me of the intimate charm European cities are celebrated for.\n\nUnlike cities such as Prague and Budapest, where grand rivers dictate the city’s divide, Zagreb’s two halves meld seamlessly.\n\nDuring one of my stays, I had the pleasure of residing at Dolac One apartment, nestled just off the market square.\n\nThe ambiance was nothing short of magical, although I must admit, finding parking did have its challenges, even with modern technology like GPS at my disposal.\n\nHowever, if you ask me where the heart of the city truly beats, I’d point you straight to Lower Town.\n\nThis bustling part of Zagreb, pulsating with life and energy, has a gravitational pull.\n\nI recall my delightful stay at Hotel Dubrovnik, right in the heart of the pedestrian zone. The proximity to restaurants, cafes, and shops made every day an adventure.\n\nThere’s a reason why many describe Lower Town as “authentic.” But let’s not forget about the atmospheric Upper Town!\n\nWith its unique dining spots and bars, it offers a serene yet intriguing contrast to the bustling Lower.\n\nYet, when it came to places like Rooms Zagreb 17, my experience was mixed – while it’s a brilliant place overall, there were some nuances I couldn’t quite overlook.\n\nIn conclusion, for those who seek vibrancy, Lower Town is your muse. But if a blend of history and calm is what you desire, don’t overlook the allure of Upper Town. Whichever you choose, Zagreb promises a journey of discovery at every corner.\n\nIf you’re venturing to Zagreb, why not take the scenic route and indulge in Croatia’s coastal gems too?\n\nStart your journey in Zagreb, absorbing its historic charm and lively street culture.\n\nThen, head south to Split, where Roman architecture meets azure shores.\n\nContinue to the sun-kissed island of Hvar, a paradise for both party-goers and tranquility seekers.\n\nLastly, set sail to Dubrovnik, the “Pearl of the Adriatic,” with its majestic walls and unparalleled sea views.\n\nCombining these destinations offers a taste of Croatia’s urban allure and its splendid Mediterranean coastline – a journey that beautifully mingles culture, history, and natural wonders."
