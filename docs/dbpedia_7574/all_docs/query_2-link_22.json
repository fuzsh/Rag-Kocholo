        "text": "Welcome to Zagreb, the charming capital of Croatia!\n\nZagreb is an old Central European city, located at the intersection of important roads between the Adriatic coast and Central Europe. When Croatians gained their independence in 1991, Zagreb became the capital, political and administrative center of the Republic of Croatia. With approximately 800.000 inhabitants, Zagreb is also the largest Croatian city.\n\nFor centuries Zagreb has developed as a city of culture, a powerful trading and economic center. It is also a center of science and knowledge, housing the largest Croatian university and many important institutions. Despite the rapid development, the town has retained its distinctive beauty and relaxed way of life.\n\nZagreb developed from two medieval settlements situated on two neighboring hills. The first written mention of Zagreb dates from 1094 and confirms the establishment of the diocese at Kaptol. The neighboring Gradec was proclaimed a free royal city in 1242. Both settlements were surrounded by fortified walls and towers, the remains of which have been preserved to this day. The two towns continued to develop separately until 1850 when they were united into Zagreb. Today, Kaptol and Gradec represent a historic core of the city, which has changed very little since the 13th century.\n\nIn the 19th century, after the unification, the city began to spread. The entire Lower Town area was constructed during this century. With beautiful palaces and green parks, it is forming what we call the Green Horseshoe.\n\nThe 20th century brought wealth and industry. It made the city grow and spread, for the first time, to the other side of the river Sava. The new area got the name Novi Zagreb (New Zagreb), where, as opposed to the city center, modern and brutalist architecture is dominant.\n\nBan Jelačić Square\n\nBan Jelačić Square is the central city’s square, situated in the heart of Zagreb. It is where Kaptol, Upper Town and Lower Town meet. Until the 17th century, it was an empty field beneath the walls of Gradec and Kaptol. At the time, it became a marketplace where inhabitants of the two settlements would meet and exchange goods. The first buildings were erected in the 17th and 18th centuries. But most buildings were constructed in the 19th century when the square was first named in honor of ban Jelačić.\n\nBan Josip Jelačić is one of the most prominent figures in Croatian history. He was a count, a general, and a ban (governor) of Croatia in the times of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But what earned him fame and glory among the Croatian people is the abolition of serfdom that he proclaimed, as well as his commitment to persuading greater Croatian autonomy in the Empire.\n\nIn 1947 the Yugoslav government changed the name of the square to Republic Square. In 1990, on the path to their independence, Croatians returned the name of ban Jelačić. Today, the statue of ban Jelačić stands proudly in the middle of the square, where all important events take place.\n\nTkalčićeva Street\n\nTkalčićeva Street is the most attractive street in Zagreb. With many restaurants and cafes, as well as traditional local shops, it is one of the busiest and most vibrant streets in the city center. The street is as lively at night as it is during the day. Many locals and tourists fill the terraces of the bars, enjoying their time drinking beer or listening to live music.\n\nThe street also has a fascinating history. Before the 19th century, a stream was flowing at the site of today’s Tkalčićeva street, dividing the two settlements – Gradec and Kaptol. There were many bridges over the stream at the time, where residents of both settlements would meet for trade or other purposes. It was also a place of frequent conflicts between the citizens. One of the former bridges is now a street that connects Tkalčićeva and Radićeva streets. It got the name Krvavi most (Bloody Bridge) due to the bloodiest battle that took place here. Both sides suffered significant losses in the battle. The stream was covered with soil in the 19th century when the settlements were joined together. At the time, Tkalčićeva street became the red light district, since almost every house in the street was a brothel. Of course, that has changed since then!\n\nZagreb Cathedral\n\nZagreb Cathedral is one of the landmarks of the city. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Ever since the 11th century, it has been dominating the Kaptol square. The first cathedral was set on fire in the 13th century. The second one, on the other hand, was severely damaged in the earthquake in 1880. The appearance the cathedral has today is a result of the restoration after the earthquake. It was restored in the Neo-Gothic style by Hermann Bollé, a famous German-born architect who lived in Zagreb at the time. In the 16th century, the renaissance-style walls and towers were built to protect the cathedral. The walls are still present today, except for the front part of the fortification system. It was torn down during the 19th-century restoration, to ease the entrance to the church.\n\nToday, the Cathedral of Zagreb is 77 meters long and 46 meters wide. With two towers that reach a height of 108 meters, it is the highest building in Croatia! The cathedral’s interior contains several “surprises”. There’s a clock that still shows the time of the 1880’s earthquake. There’s an organ, classified among the world’s top ten most excellent organs. Furthermore, there’s the grave of Blessed Alojzije Stepinac. The cathedral treasury, or beautiful baroque marble altars and statues.\n\nThe Cathedral is open to visitors every day from 10:00 to 17:00 (from 13:00 to 17:00 on Sundays). Visitors are also welcomed to attend the mass every day at 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, and 18:00.\n\nStone Gate\n\nThere used to be four gates to the fortified city of Gradec. The only preserved is the eastern one, known as Kamenita Vrata (Stone Gate). The Stone Gate not only connects Radićeva Street and the Upper Town but is also the city’s most beautiful shrine. The gate was built in the 13th century and has since become a major attraction.\n\nThe shrine in the passage was established in the 18th century. On the 31st of May 1731, a great fire destroyed Gradec, burning almost all the houses to the ground. At that time, a painting of the Virgin Mary was displayed in the passage. Miraculously, the picture remained intact and undamaged by the fire. Since then, the citizens of Zagreb adopted the Virgin Mary of the Stone Gate as their patron saint. The 31st of May has since been celebrated as Zagreb City Day.\n\nSt Mark’s Square\n\nSt Mark’s Square represents the heart of the Upper Town. The square is home to Zagreb’s most iconic church and to some of the most important state institutions.\n\nThe St Mark’s Church dominates the square in all its glory. The oldest part of the church dates from the 13th century, but the Neo-Gothic appearance is a result of the later renovation. The bell tower, however, was restored in a Neo-Baroque style. But what makes this church the most photographed church in Zagreb is its colorful tiled roof. The glazed roof tiles, installed in the 19th century, represent traditional Croatian colors – red, white, and blue. The same colors are present on the Croatian flag, too. The design also includes two coats of arms. The one on the left represents The Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, while the one on the right represents the city of Zagreb.\n\nOther notable buildings on the square include the Croatian Government (on the left), the Croatian Parliament (on the right), and the Constitutional Court (behind the church).\n\nLotrščak Tower\n\nOnce guarding the south entrance to Gradec, Lotrščak Tower is, together with the Stone Gate, the only remaining part of the medieval fortification system of the Upper Town. With its four floors, the tower reaches a height of 30 meters. There used to be a bell on the top which would ring every night before closing the gates. It also alarmed the citizens of a robbery or danger. Today, however, the tower houses a cannon that is fired every day at noon, from the top floor. The noise generated by the Grič cannon can be heard in all the Upper and Lower Town and ever further. Thanks to the cannon, Lotrščak Tower is one of the most recognizable symbols of Zagreb.\n\nNovi Zagreb\n\nNovi Zagreb (or New Zagreb), as its name indicates, is (or was) a new part of the city. Located south of the river Sava, Novi Zagreb was built only after World War II. There are several bridges over the river Sava that connect the north and south bank, which is Zagreb and Novi Zagreb. The most famous bridges are Jadranski most (Adriatic Bridge), Savski most (Sava Bridge), Željeznički most (Railway Bridge), Most slobode (Bridge of Freedom), and Most mladosti (Bridge of Youth).\n\nThe one that stands out is the Railway Bridge, one of the oldest bridges over the Sava river, built in 1939. It is also known as Green Bridge or Hendrix Bridge because of its distinguishing green construction and the “Hendrix” graffiti, which reappears after every refurbishing in the last few decades. Due to this, it has become one of the icons of the Croatian capital. Recently, the bridge was updated with colorful lights that light up every time a train pass.\n\nNovi Zagreb is also home to the largest residential building in Croatia, and one of the largest in Europe. The building was built in 1974 and has since been popularly known as Mamutica (Mammoth). It contains 1.169 apartments that accommodate approximately 5.000 people.\n\nAnother notable site of Novi Zagreb is Zagreb’s Trade Fair, one of the largest fairs in this part of Europe. First established in 1909, the fair was moved to the site in 1956. It has since hosted many exhibitions, trade fairs, expos, and concerts in its pavilions. One of the most visited shows is Interliber, the annual book fair that is held here every September.\n\nMore recent sights of Novi Zagreb include the Museum of Contemporary Art and Arena Zagreb, the largest sports arena in Croatia.\n\nMirogoj cemetery\n\nMirogoj is the largest and the most beautiful cemetery in Zagreb. Surrounded by landscaped greenery, it is also a lovely park. All those who decide to visit Mirogoj will be amazed at the very first step. The entrance to the cemetery is “guarded” by the monumental, 500-meter-long arcades. The Neo-Renaissance arcades, designed by Herman Bollé, are another beautiful example of historicist architecture in Zagreb. The cemetery, established in the 19th century, is also a place of religious tolerance, as citizens of all religions were buried here. The segregation of graves was and still is strictly forbidden. Therefore, many famous Croats, no matter their religion or background, are embedded here. The cemetery and its park offer a unique network of trails for all those who seek an escape from the city bustle.\n\nZagreb museums\n\nZagreb is a European city with the highest number of museums and galleries per capita! Besides all the traditional art and history museums, Croatian capital has a significant amount of exciting and somewhat uncommon themed museums.\n\nThe one that stands out is a Museum of Broken Relationships, situated in the Upper Town. The museum was founded in 2010 by two Croatian artists whose love story has just come to an end. They didn’t know what to do with all the things they gathered over the years. So they came up with the idea of a museum dedicated to unsuccessful relationships. The exhibition contains personal objects that former lovers from all over the world have donated to the museum. Each object comes with a brief description, a story behind the object and the broken relationship it represents. It is a unique opportunity to visit such a museum, so don’t miss it, because it guarantees a lot of fun!\n\nAnother great place to visit with kids or friends is a Museum of Illusions. The museum offers a fun experience that engages all your senses. It provides not only a lot of fun but also great photos you can publish later. Children will also love Backo Mini Express, a museum of model railway. With more than 1,050 meters of tracks and different models of trains, it is one of the largest museums of this kind in Europe.\n\nThe recently opened Chocolate Museum is a must for every chocolate enthusiast. Croatian School Museum and Zagreb 80’s Museum offer an exciting approach to history. And the Museum of Hangovers and Museum of Torture speak for themselves.\n\nA must for all science enthusiasts is a Nikola Tesla Technical Museum. Visitors can visit the replica of Nikola Tesla’s laboratory, a mine, and a planetarium. Sports buffs are welcome to visit Dražen Petrović Memorial Museum, dedicated to Croatian greatest basketball player.\n\nFor those who prefer classical art and a more traditional approach to history, we recommend visiting Mimara, State Archives, Archeological Museum, Zagreb City Museum, or Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nZagreb shopping\n\nZagreb city center is full of cool gift shops, art and craft shops, designer boutiques, street fashion brands, and many other places that you can visit to fill in the gaps between all the sightseeing. From traditional souvenirs to designer artifacts, everyone will find something to their liking on the streets of Zagreb.\n\nTypical souvenirs include the gingerbread heart (a token of love in a shape of a red glazed heart), a tie (which is Croatian “invention”), Šestine’s umbrella (a red striped umbrella, used as part of traditional clothing), or paprenjak biscuit (traditional biscuit that has peppery flavor).\n\nFor those who prefer to buy clothes, there are several shops in Ilica Street. Bigger shopping centers are located outside the city center but are easily accessible by any kind of public transportation. One of the most famous centers in Zagreb is Arena Centar, located next to the sports arena in Novi Zagreb.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb\n\nIf you decide to visit Zagreb for Christmas and New Year’s Eve, you won’t be sorry! Although visiting Croatia in summer has its perks, Zagreb has made its name by being reselected a few years in a row as the best Christmas market in Europe (as voted by visitors!).\n\nDuring the last month of the year, Zagreb turns into a winter fairytale. With a large ice rink and a lot of Christmas lights, Advent in Zagreb has become a traditional event held at several locations in the city center. The Advent offers a rich cultural and entertainment program. Not to mention all the excellent food that visitors can try. From traditional winter specialties, such as sausages with sauerkraut, to gourmet burgers and international cuisine.\n\nPublic transport in the center of Zagreb is mostly operated by electric trams, while buses run on the broader city area. Most trams stop at Main Railway Station and Ban Jelačić Square. Buses for Novi Zagreb, Maksimir, Jarun Lake, and Mirogoj cemetery leave from the platform behind the Main Railway Station. The detailed schedule is available here.\n\nYou can buy a ticket at kiosks or in the vehicle. The price of the ticket depends on the fare you choose – 4kn/30min, 7kn/60min, or 10kn/90min. The daily ticket will cost you 30 kunas. When buying the ticket from the driver, it will cost you 15 kunas. By entering a tram or bus, every passenger is obligated to validate a purchased ticket. Machines for validating paper tickets are installed at the first door of the vehicle.\n\nAnother way of getting around the town is by taxi or Uber. Bike rental is also possible, and it’s a great way to explore the city if you prefer an active approach. If, however, you are out of your strength from all the sightseeing, consider taking a funicular that connects Upper and Lower Town. The ticket can be bought on-site, and the ride lasts not more than a minute.\n\nCroatian cuisine is a blend of various influences – Mediterranean, Austro-Hungarian, and even Turkish. Due to the historical influences, each region has its own distinct culinary tradition. Zagreb, located in the central part of Croatia, is mostly influenced by Austro-Hungarian cuisine and has many similarities with central European countries. Traditional dishes include meat dishes with potatoes or rice, minced meat dishes, mushroom dishes, sausages with cabbage, vegetable and meat stews, freshwater fish, etc.\n\nIf you are interested in trying some of the best food typical for this region, we suggest visiting Dolac Market, a favorite place for many citizens of Zagreb. In its offer, you will find fresh seasonal fruit and vegetables, dry fruit, all kind of salads from the winter store, jams, honey, fresh fish and meat, cheese and other dairy products, and much more. One of the symbols of Zagreb cuisine is cottage cheese with cream, so don’t miss a chance to try it. It’s a great dinner alternative.\n\nAnother iconic dish is štrukli (pastry filled with cottage cheese and sour cream), which is prepared either boiled in water or baked in the oven. There is a restaurant in Zagreb serving only štrukli, called La Štruk. The restaurant offers traditional štrukli, as well as štrukli with blueberries, hot pepper, or truffles.\n\nPivovara Medvedgrad offers all the traditional delicacies accompanied by the finest local beer. With four pubs in the city center that are always full, Pivovara Medvedgrad guarantees a tasty dish and a nice pint of beer.\n\nFor those who prefer to eat in restaurants, we recommend Boban, Vinodol, and Ribice i tri točkice, all located in or around the Nikola Tesla Street.\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, don’t miss Zagreb’s popular pastry shops. There’s Vincek, a famous local pastry shop operating on several locations around Zagreb. Vincek has a more traditional approach to baking and serves traditional Croatian desserts. If you prefer a more modern approach, go with Amelie, a lovely little place located near the cathedral. If you wish to take some sweets home with you, visit Kraš in Ilica street, the Croatian most beloved chocolatier and candy shop.\n\nKarlovac\n\nIf you have an extra day to spare, consider visiting Karlovac, a charming town located only 40 km south of Zagreb. Karlovac is the city of parks and rivers. It has four rivers flowing through it, which gets very handy during the summer months when you can go swimming or even rafting. Furthermore, you can enjoy your walk through the central part of the town, the so-called star, built in the 16th century as a Renaissance fortress. Among the other attractions, Karlovac is home to Aquatika (freshwater aquarium) and Homeland War Museum. And the good thing is that Karlovac lies on your way to Plitvice Lakes National Park.\n\nVaraždin\n\nVaraždin is known as a Baroque town, thanks to the beautifully preserved historical center. The Old Town of Varaždin houses a castle (turned into a museum). Several other mansions remind visitors of the times when this lovely town served as the capital of Croatia. The most popular event held in Varaždin is Špancirfest – an annually-held outdoor festival that fills the Varaždin Old Town with live music, markets, street performances, and many visitors. When in Varaždin, consider visiting the Trakošćan Castle, as well. Trakošćan, dating back to the 13th century, is the most beautiful Croatian castle. Located on top of a hill, with a romantic park and lake beneath it, the castle will offer you a dash of the aristocracy."
