        "text": "In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,110,517. It is the only metropolitan area in Croatia with a population of over one million.\n\nZagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city.\n\nZagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Western Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the center of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia.\n\nZagreb is a city with rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement in the urban area of the city is Andautonia, a Roman settlement in the place of today’s Scitarjevo.\n\nFirst recognition of the settlement as Zagreb appears to have been recorded in 1094, although the origins of the name Zagreb are less clear. Popular Croatian legend suggests that, while crossing a deserted region with his thirsty troops, a Croatian ban or viceroy drove his sabre into the ground through sheer frustration at his plight and, on doing so, inadvertetly uncovered a source of water, saving the day for both himself and his troops.\n\nThe ban immediately ordered the troops to scrape the soil in order to uncover the water, and the name Zagreb comes from the Croatian verb to scrape.The city is protected from the cold northern winds by the mountain of Medvednica and opens up to the rest of the world thanks to a spacious plain and the Sava river.\n\nRight in the city center, parks, streets and squares intersect with green spaces and gardens. Landscaped in the 19th century, Strossmayer Promenade in the Upper Town is where you can enjoy a romantic panorama of Zagreb accompanied by the poet A.G. Matos, in sculpture form, and discover why it is often called as a green town.\n\nZagreb is a city of green parks and walks, with many places to visit in the beautiful surroundings.\n\nThe city is divided into three parts: the thousand-year old Gornji grad (Upper Town) which contains the Presidential Palace, the iconic St Mark’s Church, the Croatian parliament (Sabor), and museums and galleries which are all set in cobbled streets lit by gas lamps; the 19th century Donji grad (Lower Town) with its shops, restaurants, cafes, theaters and parks; and the modern post-World War II area of Novi Zagreb (‘new Zagreb’) which is full of high-rise buildings and basically has little to offer to visitors.\n\nWalk along the streets and monuments of Zagreb which proudly testify to its thousands of years of history. Visiting Zagreb gives you an experience of becoming a friend with a city of art, culture, sports, recreation, lifestyle, gastronomy and rich historical heritage. It is a city which truly remains in every traveler’s memories and heart.\n\nHow to get to Zagreb?\n\nBy Air\n\nZagreb Airport is located 17 km from the center of the city, in the district of Pleso. There is a bus link between the main airport (Zracna luka) and the main bus station (Autobusni kolodvor) in Zagreb. The bus ride from the airport to the main bus station takes around 25 min.\n\nBy Train\n\nThe Main Railway Station is located in the center of the City (at Kralj Tomislav Square 12). Zagreb Central Station (Glavni kolodvor) is a railway hub which has direct services to major European cities as well as domestic services to all major towns (except Dubrovnik). There is also an overnight train (with sleeping compartments) between Zagreb and Split.\n\nBy Road\n\nAlmost all highways in Croatia start or end in Zagreb.\n\nTo use highways in Croatia you must pay a toll in cash or by credit card.\n\nMain international roads are:\n\nTrieste-Ljubljana-Zagreb\n\nGraz-Maribor-Zagreb\n\nKlagenfurt-Ljubljana-Zagreb\n\nBudapest-Varazdin-Zagreb\n\nFancy some big city atmosphere after your holidays in Dalmatia?
