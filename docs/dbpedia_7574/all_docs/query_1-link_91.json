        "text": "Relocating to Zagreb\n\nAs the capital of Croatia, Zagreb has more than enough to offer any expat thinking about living there. There are a variety of housing options at great rates too, from contemporary apartments near Lake Jarun, to cute 19th century apartments in downtown Zagreb. So, whether youâre a foreigner in banking, or an English expatriate looking to find quirky properties, there is something for everyone.\n\nAbout the City\n\nLocated in the northwest of the country and south of Medvednica Mountain, Zagreb has been the Croatian capital since 1945. The 2011 census saw the population come in at over 1.1 million, making it the only metropolitan part of Croatia with over a million people. Itâs still relatively small though, coming in at 20 by 30 kilometers.\n\nAndautonia is the most historically rich part of the city, coming to fruition all the way back to Roman times. The city is split up into 17 districts, most of which lie along the river Sava valley. Zagreb is known for providing a great quality of living, and boasts a booming economy that has specialized in technology and service industries.\n\nVisas for Croatia\n\nThere are a few requirements to meet before obtaining a permanent residency in Croatia.\n\nNon-EU nationals must apply for a visa quote and a temporary residence permit if staying over 90 days. If you have already found a job, a work permit must also be granted by the government. Those that are self-employed must also be granted a business permit to legally trade in Croatia.\n\nPeople within the EU are granted free movement and donât require a visa. During the first seven years after Croatia joined the EU, i.e. until June 2020, some EU nationals may still need a work or business permit for Croatia. A residence permit must also be granted from the local police for any stays over three months. For more information on these topics, please refer to our article on Moving to Croatia.\n\nThe Climate in Zagreb\n\nUnlike some European cities, Zagreb enjoys four distinct seasons. Due to a lack of sea breeze that is prevalent in coastal regions in Croatia, the city is hotter than other parts of the country, particularly in the summer and at the end of spring.\n\nAverage temperatures in summer are 20Â°C, and days are generally very dry. Winter often reaches -4Â°C, with snowfall being quite common during January. Autumn is actually quite pleasant, but unpredictable with rainfall. Spring is probably the most enjoyable season in Zagreb, but only lasts during April and May, with temperatures often reaching 30Â°C towards the end of the season."
