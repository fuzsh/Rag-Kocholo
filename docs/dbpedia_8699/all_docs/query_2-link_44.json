        "text": "Although lithography was invented in 1798, at first it was too slow and expensive for poster production. Most posters were made using wood or metal engravings with little color or design. Here are 10 19th-century party posters that will make you feel like dancing, created by geniuses of the 1890s: Cheret, Toulouse-Lautrec, Alphonse Mucha, and many others. Enjoy!\n\nIt all began with Jules Cheret. Called the father of the modern poster, he invented the “3-stone lithographic process” in the 1880s. This was a breakthrough that allowed artists to achieve every color in the rainbow with as little as three stones – usually red, yellow, and blue – printed in careful registration. An extremely gifted artist as well, Cheret created more than 1000 posters over his 30-year career. Most of them advertised cabarets, theatre plays, alcohol, and cigarettes. Everything we need to be in the mood for a crazy party!\n\n1. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Confetti\n\nClick here to discover rare photographs of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. He was a real prankster!\n\n2. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jane Avril\n\nMeet Jane Avril in person here. Who was she? And how she came to know Toulouse-Lautrec?\n\n3. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Moulin Rouge\n\nAh, Moulin Rouge… This is an iconic place for art history; it housed, entertained, and inspired countless artists in the 19th century. See some depictions of the famous can-can dance at Moulin Rouge in art!\n\n4. Marcello Dudovich, Mele Napoli\n\nMarcello Dudovich was an Italian painter, illustrator, and poster designer. Alphonse Mucha was one of his teachers but Dudovich is famous for developing his own distinctive style.\n\n5. Alphonse Mucha, Champagne Ruinart\n\nMucha’s posters for Ruinart champagne are from the same period as his famous posters with the divine Sarah Bernhardt!\n\n6. Alphonse Mucha, Biscuits Champagne\n\nAlphonse Mucha had a major exhibition at the North Carolina Museum of Art a few years ago. For those who did not see it, here is the exhibition review by one of our authors!\n\n7. Alphonse Mucha, Heidsieck Champagne\n\nThe people in Mucha’s poster are in a truly festive mood, sipping their Heidsieck champagne. Are you also in the mood for some artsy cocktails? Here‘s some inspiration.\n\n8. Pierre Bonnard, France Champagne\n\nIf you’re familiar with the name Les Nabis in art, then you must be familiar with the works of Pierre Bonnard!\n\n9. Jules Cheret, Eldorado Music Hall\n\n10. Jules Cheret, Carnaval at the Theatre de l’Opera"
