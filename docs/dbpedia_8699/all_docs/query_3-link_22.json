        "text": "Perhaps you've already heard some fun facts about this one. For example, the two people (looking super excited to be there, by the way) are not wife and husband, but rather daughter and father. Or maybe that—while they look like farmers—the models are actually the artist's sister and their dentist. A more unfamiliar tidbit is that the actual inspiration for the artwork and its namesake come from the house behind the pair. As the story goes, Wood was in Eldon, Iowa cruising for his own creative spark when he saw the house which he thought was \"very paintable\" despite (or possibly because of) the absurdity of having \"a Gothic–style window in such a flimsy frame house.\"\n\nArrangement in Grey and Black No. 1\n\nJames Abbott McNeill Whistler\n\n1871\n\nOil on Canvas\n\nThere's a nuanced story behind this one, primarily centered on several key things that you've probably questioned just from the painting and title alone, and even more so if you're familiar with this one even just a little bit.\n\n1. The Title\n\nMost people know this painting as Whistler's Mother, and you're right (colloquially). This is in fact a painting of James' mom. There's some speculation as to whether or not the artist's mother was supposed to be the original subject and why she's sitting down, but it's official title implies there's more than one painting (and there is, but like many sequels, the original gets retitled retroactively after part 2 drops).\n\n2. The Artist\n\nWhistler was an American based in the United Kingdom, and did not care at all for his British critics. So he found great delight when it became so celebrated by the French. In fact, it's one of the most famous American paintings outside of America and has the distinction of being recognized as a Victorian Mona Lisa.\n\n3. The Icon\n\nThis painting is everywhere. The original of course remains in Paris, but you've seen it in movies, commercials, cartoons, books, television, and in music too. In fact, the first time I ever saw the iconic image was in Miss Piggy's Art Masterpiece 1983 Calendar as Whistler's Weirdo featuring Gonzo. Art historian Martha Tedeschi summed pretty much everything I've written about today best when she stated, \"Whistler's Mother, Wood's American Gothic, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Edvard Munch's The Scream have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.\"\n\nSalvator Mundi\n\nLeonardo DaVinci\n\nc. 1499–1510\n\nOil on walnut panel\n\nOoh, get ready for some speculation! But first, here are the facts: the painting depicts Christ making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left (put a pin in that for a moment), signaling his role as Salvator Mundi (Latin for 'Savior of the World'). It is also the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction for 450 million smackaroos. Now let's get gossipy! It is attributed to DaVinci for a couple reasons: a bunch of copies and variations by students and followers of Leo have been identified, and there are two prepatory chalk drawings of the drapery by DaVinci. What initially threw everyone off the trail was that the painting was thought to have been destroyed or lost in 1603, but was rediscovered in 1978 and thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting (in other words, someone painted over the original either to make it their own like ya' boy here is doin' or they tried to restore it). Now most art historians have concluded the hidden painting beneath is Leonardo's work—it's superior to whoever painted over it, and meets perfectionist standards only the Renaissance Man himself could achieve. A few other art historians say Leonardo definitely helped, but the composition is a little blasé and not his style. Also, there's no documentation in Leonardo's records that he was the artist for it. And finally, there's disagreement as to whether the orb Jesus is holding would be painted more realistically (something DaVinci would have been more than capable of and known for doing) or that he purposefully pulled back the realism so as not to distract from J.C.\n\nFor the cultured and refined, this masterpiece is an icon of Italian Renaissance painting. For the rest of us, one may hear the voice of Carl Carlson from The Simpsons ask, \"Whats the matter Homer? Ain’t ya never seen a naked chick riding a clam before?\" But what's actually going on here? The painting represents a traditional scene from Greek mythology. The wind god Zephyrus and Aura (the personification of a lighter breeze) blow a newborn goddess Venus floating on a giant scallop shell over to the shore where Flora—one of the Hora of Spring (minor goddess of the seasons)—waits to put a robe over Venus. Large depictions of scenes and subjects from classic mythology were unprecedented at the time, so it's speculated this piece was privately commissioned.\n\nOf all my takes on famous artworks, I put the most time and effort into this one. Creating my own nondescript Whatnot/Anything Muppets is always fun, and for a piece like this, I get to really practice my digital painting chops.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my own takes on these famous artworks, but I really hope you learned some fun things about the originals that inspired them! What are your favorite pieces of famous art? Have you ever tried your own study of them? Follow me on Instagram and Twitter and let me know!\n\nHave you ever had a creative block? Three months ago I wrote about how I was frustrated I hadn’t been drawing for myself and how creative blocks can arise when your hobby and passion share the spotlight with your career. I get to draw for a living, but when I get busy drawing for clients, it’s hard to find a balance and return to what you do as a hobby when it’s also your bread and butter. Now there are lots of ways I’ve shared as an illustrator to help get out of such a block; drawing what you enjoy, returning to subjects that fueled you as a child, celebrating your fandoms, new takes on your older works, or finding joy drawing with children. Today I’m going to share yet another way to get your creative juices flowing and it also happens to be educational too (but not boring).\n\nWhen you’re starting out, you draw what you see and love and while you try your hardest, no matter what, you’ll always give your own take on those things. When looking for a creative spark, taking this mentality to the masters is a great way to go! So today I’m showing off how recreating famous works of art is insightful, inspiring, educational, and best of all; fun!\n\nWe Can Do It!\n\n1943\n\nJ. Howard Miller (Westinghouse)\n\nAll the day long,\n\nWhether rain or shine,\n\nShe's a part of the assembly line.\n\nShe's making history,\n\nWorking for victory,\n\nRosie the Riveter.\n\nThere are two famous works featuring Rosie, but today, most are familiar with Miller's render of the strong female production worker flexing while rolling her sleeves up. Back in 1943 however, most Americans wouldn't have seen that poster but rather have known Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post cover. Miller's piece wasn't even originally associated with the Rosie figure and was only seen by Westinghouse workers when it was displayed internally for only two weeks in February, 1943—sponsored by the company's internal War Production Co-Ordinating Committee—and wasn't rediscovered until the early 1980s. The Rosie character was originally popularized in song in 1942 by Suzy Bogguss and was a representation of the women who worked in shipyards and factories during World War II, replacing the men who joined the military.\n\nI created my own version of Rosie for a Christmas card concept in 2020 for The Salvation Army. It was rejected, but that hasn't stopped me from resubmitting it every year since and for a number of other Army related projects too. For me personally though, it's the version of Miss Piggy as Rosie that I designed for ToughPigs 10th Anniversary in 2011 and which they've continued to use as their avatar across social media—something I'm incredibly proud of.\n\nLa Dama Bianca\n\nMarcello Dudovich\n\n1918\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Usually someone says that when they're caught making fun of someone else and are trying to placate them before getting into more trouble. I'm using it as a creative crutch to help inspire my own art and write this entire blog post. In regards to this famous Art Deco poster however, it's frustratingly apropos. Marcello Dudovich is celebrated as one of Italy's greatest poster artists known for his very distinct and colorful style. From what I have gathered however, in regards to this famous Martini & Rossi commissioned poster (The White Lady), Dudovich designed the art to reflect the style of Leonetto Cappiello—another famous Italian painter known for his French posters. You can buy prints of this painting almost everywhere online, but there's very little information about the actual poster Dudovich painted available.\n\nWhen I was young and even more pretentious, I first saw some paintings by Jackson Pollock and scoffed, \"How is this art? I could do this! Heck, anyone could do this!\" To which my father immediately countered, \"But you didn't.\" I hope he reveled in that moment as a dad by saying something so simple and yet so profound that it shut his obnoxious, teenage son up instantly. I've heard similar smart aleck comments about The Son of Man, and its initial knee–jerk reaction as just a dude with an apple over his face. But what's really fascinating about this piece is what it doesn't tell you. Everything you want to see—the man's face, the low wall, the seascape—are all obscured. Magritte explains his own art best, \"It's something that happens constantly. Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.\" Maybe it was the apple, but I originally wanted to make my own version out of emoji’s but decided to just draw it in that style myself.\n\nThe Thinker\n\nAuguste Rodin\n\n1904\n\nBronze sculpture\n\nMichelangelo's work on and involvement with the Sistine Chapel's ceiling proves that artists and designers have been dealing with the same bull$#!% for at least 500 years now. You see, originally he was commissioned by the Pope to build his holiness' tomb with a five year deadline (it took 40 and Mikey never felt satisfied with it). Another painter was miffed Michelangelo got the tomb gig and convinced the Pope to hire Michelangelo to do the chapel ceiling in a medium Mikey was unfamiliar with. That other artist's sole motivation being that this would result in Michelangelo failing (because what better way to elevate yourself by making the competition look bad?). Michelangelo convinced the Pope to let him wing it with a different (albeit more complex) design scheme than originally envisioned (because being your own boss gives you even more freedom) and thus, we have The Creation of Adam (along with the rest of the chapel ceiling)."
