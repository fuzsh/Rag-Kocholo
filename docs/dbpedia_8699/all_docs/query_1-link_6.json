This artistic style was characterized by its ornamental and decorative elements, inspired by natural materials and forms. Italian Art Nouveau architecture, in particular, was known for its intricate designs and the use of new technologies to create highly ornamental and elaborate structures.\n\nItalian Art Nouveau artists welcomed organic forms, asymmetrical lines, and ornate decorative motifs, drawing inspiration from nature and the human form. They sought to break away from traditional artistic conventions and embrace a more modern aesthetic, characterized by fluidity, elegance, and innovation.\n\nItalian Art Nouveau’s legacy continues to be celebrated today, with many architectural landmarks and design objects preserved as cultural treasures.\n\n1.

The Art Nouveau movement originated in Europe, particularly France and Belgium, in the 1890s.
