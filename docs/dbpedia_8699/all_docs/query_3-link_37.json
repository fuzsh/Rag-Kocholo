        "meta_description": "An elegant woman welcomes an unseen companion back to the table for a post-meal glass of Martini Sweet Vermouth. Her hair and shawl mimic the color of the beverage and the background fades away into a solid block of deep rust. This is a classic design by noted graphic illustrator, Marcello Dudovich. This is the second printing of this poster; it issued in 1957. The first printing of this poster was done in 1910, when the subject's clothing would have been the height of style. Martini & Rossi was founded by businessman Alessandro Martini, winemaker Lugio Rossi, and accountant Teofilo Sola in the mid-19th century in Turin, Italy. The company was one of the first brands to produce Vermouth, and later became famous for the cocktail named Martini; a mixed alcoholic drink its founder invented. A Martini is prepared by mixing gin or vodka and vermouth together and is often garnished by an olive or a lemon twist. Over the years, Martini has become one of the best-known cocktails. This is an Original Vintage Poster. It is not a reproduction. This poster is conservation mounted, linen backed and in excellent condition. We guarantee the authenticity of all of our posters.",
