        "text": "A number of manufacturers of various goods have invested in good graphic design in order to sell their products better. In particular, the enterprises producing alcoholic beverages are known for hiring high profile designers to release easy recognizable and staggering images which best represent the feeling of enjoyment, flavor and the style which the drink offers. One of the best-known examples of such graphic design are the famous Campari Art Posters.\n\nBefore we come to the artists responsible for these magnificent designs, it is mandatory to pose a couple of facts concerning this particular medium. Namely, the historical rise of graphic design is quite long, yet this particular art form, which encompasses typography, photography and illustration, started blossoming in the second half of 19th and beginning of the 20th century within the Arts and Crafts movement and Art Nouveau. The curiosity is that the very term graphic design was introduced in an essay New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design written by an American book designer William Addison Dwiggins in 1922.\n\nInitially, the medium was used as a utilitarian tool for visual communication with the society and was not considered a legitimate art branch. Nevertheless, with the development of the early market it became increasingly present and was used to visually enhance a certain product. Still, it managed to keep a high artistic domain.\n\nBranding The Campari Poster Art\n\nThe Campari company was founded in Milan in 1860 by Gaspare Campari and it worked continuously on creating a recognizable image within the market. The recipe of the ruby red liquor was made in Novara the same year, and it consists of bitter herbs, aromatic plants, and fruit in alcohol and water.\n\nThe person responsible for introducing modern marketing approach to the company was Davide Campari (1867-1936), who started collaborating with the trendiest designers of the time such as Marcello Nizzoli, Leonetto Cappiello, and Adolf Hohenstein. The most celebrated Campari commissions happened during the 1920s with the Futurist artist Fortunato Depero, who believed that the publicity poster would be the painting of the future. That spirit reflected on the post-war commissions with Pop and witty designs by Franz Marangolo and Bruno Munari, who embodied through their posters the spirit of the Swinging Sixties.\n\nCampari Posters at Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art\n\nCurrently in London, an exhibition titled The Art of Campari is on display. Consisting of designs and posters by some of the most influential artists who worked for the company, as well as crates, glasses, bottles, plaques and other ephemera, this showcase tends to show the visual history of the iconic ruby-red aperitif from Belle Epoque, through the 1920s, and up to the 1960s.\n\nFurthermore, by showing artifacts from the extensive Campari archives in Milan, the institution is eager to accentuate the significance of the pioneering advertising activity of the company in global terms and its overall contribution to the development of graphic design.\n\nThe Art of Campari, a print and poster collection, will be on display at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art in London until 16 September 2018.\n\nWe have made a list of five artists whose contributions to Campari branding are the most important."
