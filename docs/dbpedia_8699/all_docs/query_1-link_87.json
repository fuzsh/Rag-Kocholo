        "text": "Postcard Artists and Photographers\n\nby Joelle Steele\n\nThere are numerous artists and photographers whose works have appeared on postcards throughout the world. Some specialized in fine art â painting and sculpture â while others directed their efforts towards more commercial pursuits such as illustration and design. Many of the creative individuals whose works appear on postcards were never truly recognized for their artistic contributions and remain largely obscure to this day. Some, especially photographers, self-published their own works as postcards. And the artists and photographers who were well-known and respected for their works have left us with some highly collectable postcards bearing images of those works.\n\nThe following is a long yet only partial list of some of the better-known artists and photographers, including those who self-published their work as postcards. This list is old and was published many years ago on my website, so there may be some additional names that aren’t included here.
