        "text": "Vino Vermouth Cinzano poster – Adolfo Hohenstein 1898 – Pan\n\nThis is a reproduction of an early Vino Vermouth Cinzano poster. The poster was created in 1898 for the Cinzano drinks company by the Italian artist Adolfo Hohenstein. The artist is often referred to as the “Father of the Italian poster” and was a leading proponent of the Italian Art Nouveau movement. In this early alcohol advertising poster, Hohenstein has featured Pan, the Greek god of pastures, flocks and rustic music. He was the lord of the wild to whom satyrs, nymphs, and other forest dwelling creatures would answer. Hohenstein has depicted Pan providing musical accompaniment to the grapes vines flourishing around him. Seemingly, encouraging their stimulation and growth. Behind the half human, with the legs and horns of a goat, is one of the god’s companion nymph’s. The forest maiden is portrayed squeezing the ripened grapes into a wine vessel to produce the main ingredient of the famous Torino wine.\n\nThe Vino Vermouth Cinzano poster is characteristically produced in the ‘Stile Liberty’, the Italian Art Nouveau style Hohenstein was a leading exponent of. The poster is produced in a subdued palette of woodland colours of browns, greens and reds. Hohenstein’s famous wine poster with its’s swirling arabesque evoking the muddled merriness that imbibing Cinzano brings. The poster’s beautiful hand-lettered typography is synonymous with the art nouveau movement of the early nineteenth century. The poster reads Vino-Vermouth. FCO Cinzano e Cia.\n\nVino Vermouth Cinzano\n\nThe Italian vermouth, known best as Cinzano,was first developed by brothers Giovanni Giacomo and Carlo Stefano Cinzano. The famous Cinzano vermouths date back to 1757 when they created a new ‘vermouth rossi” or red vermouth. The brothers blended a mixture of 35 ingredients from aromatic plants from the Italian Alps. The recipe is still kept secret but the results proved extremely popular with Turin’s influential aristocracy.\n\nBy 1898, Cinzano developed its marketing strategy to include new mediums such as adverts, posters and postcards. The company have used the services of some of the most influential artists of their time. This advertising poster was created in 1889 by the German artist Adolfo Hohenstein. He is considered the father of Italian poster art and together with Leonetto Cappiello, Giovanni Mataloni, Leopoldo Metlicovitch and Marcello Dudovich, Hohenstein is recognised as one of the most important Italian poster designers.\n\nOther Cinzano poster designs\n\nThe advances of the stone lithographic printing techniques in the mid to late 1800s, saw the beginning of a new, colourful advertising age. Cinzano were keen on using the new mediums and printing techniques the belle epoque era had to offer.\n\nDeveloping its communications strategy in line with the Belle Époque’s aesthetic, Cinzano adopted new mediums and techniques the era had to offer. Posters, postcards and adverts in newspapers and magazines soon became a big part of the company’s marketing plans. such as Telegrafo magazine, a prominent Italian daily newspaper at the time. Artists and printing was expensive and only the largest Italian brands could afford to work with artists and illustrators. In 1898, Cinzano lead from the front and were bold in their style. Enrico and Emiliano Cinzano collaborated with some of the most progressive artists of the time.\n\nThree others we also love are again painted by one artist. This time they were produced thirty years later than the Hohenstein posters and reject both the art nouveau and art deco periods for a far cleaner, more modern artistic approach. The posters were created by Leonetto Cappiello.\n\nThe first, advertises the Cinzano Vermouth features a half-naked, toga wearing man riding a red striped zebra. It is one of the most iconic of all the Cinzano posters. The second was produced to advertise the release of the company’s Florio Marsala beverage. It expands on the zebra theme by adding a blue and white striped zebra running alongside the original red one.\n\nAnother Cappiello poster produced for the Cinzano group was his 1910 poster advertising the new alcoholic drink Asti Cinzano. It features a young woman wielding a bottle of the liquor whilst sitting atop of a bunch af red and green grapes. All three are classic poster designs.\n\nAdolfo Hohenstein\n\nHis career began in 1879 as a set and costume designer for La Scala and other theatres. There he meets the musical publisher Giulio Ricordi, and in 1889 begins to work for the Ricordi Graphical Workshops, as the artistic director in charge of the graphics department, going on to create the posters for famous operas such as La Bomème, Madame Butterfly and Tosca as well as publictiy for Buitoni and of course Cinzano.\n\nHohenstein was born in Russia of German parents, and came to the great Italian firm of Ricordi in 1889. Famous as the music publisher of Verdi and Puccini, Ricordi expanded its lithography operation under Hohenstein who made it the leading poster publisher in Italy as well. His opera posters Tosca, Madama Butterfly and Iris are amongst the most recognized posters of all time. And as a mentor, Hohenstein proved to be incomparable as the artists working under him reads like a who’s who of Italian poster art. Little is known about his life, but his art clearly shows that he was deeply influenced by Mucha and was more than familiar with French Art Nouveau, German Jugendstil, and the Vienna Secession.\n\nVintage Beers, Wines & Spirits Alcohol Posters\n\nEveryone loves a tipple… or so it seems. Actually reports suggest that just over 50% of adults drink at least once a week. An estimated 29.2 million adults in Great Britain alone. The half of the population that do drink, consume wine, beer, cider, champagne, spirits… in fact, almost anything we can turn to alcohol.\n\nSince posters first began being used as advertisements in the 1880s, they have been used to advertise alcoholic products. From Champagne and Wine posters, Liquer and Spirits prints to Lager and Beer Ads, there’s no doubt about it vintage alcohol posters have probably been the most advertised product over the last 120 years. Drinks posters have also produced some of the brightest, boldest, and most eye-catching of all the poster genres. Like the beverages they are selling they are usually a crowd-pleaser.\n\nSince the end of the nineteenth century, thousands of alcohol related posters have been published.

We take great care with the production of our poster prints. We also feel it is important that they maintain a vintage feel. This is why we leave some small imperfections or marks that were part of the original poster to enhance the vintage feel. These will be visible on the larger views of the item on this listing.\n\nThe originals of many of the posters we offer can cost many thousands of pounds. Our reproduction posters certainly look great! They look even better when they’re framed and mounted on a wall. It’s important to remember that we offer our prints as fun, affordable reproductions, not as fine art prints."
