        "text": "Have a family photo that you just can't figure out? Join me for a Photo Investigation! Photo Investigations are a collaborative one-on-one look at your family photos with me, Maureen Taylor, the Photo Detective. Together, we will look at how each clue in your photos might contribute to your family history, and how these images can mean so much in your research. With decades of experience in the photo and history industry, this is your chance to learn from an expert and reveal the stories in your familyâ€™s images. All investigations include a recording. Learn more at the link in my bio.\n\nWhat's in a sign? A lot! Sign-making is both a skill and an art. The artistic qualities of a finished sign are obvious, but we rarely see the skill that goes into making the sign. For that, itâ€™s best to tour a factory where signs are being built, which is precisely what we did to produce this short video. This video captures our signs in the making, courtesy the team at the SouthWood Corporation based in Rock Hill, North Carolina. #TBThttps://lnkd.in/eGZzkfpZ\n\nVintage signs have a unique ability to evoke nostalgia and transport us back to earlier times. Their weathered appearance, retro designs, and familiar branding can trigger memories of places we've been, experiences we've had, or even emotions we've felt in the past. These signs often carry a sense of history and authenticity, reminding us of bygone eras and simpler times. Whether it's the neon glow of a diner sign, the rustic charm of a roadside motel sign, or the classic logos of old-fashioned products, vintage signs have a powerful way of stirring up memories and making us reminisce about the past.\n\n#Publicpolicy certainly should be applauding rather than outlawing rejuvenation of old tech. When #tech is this elegant, one wonders whether with today's #DRM legal standards for rudimentary #ics would make reviving of #consumer #oldtech a violation of some federal law with twisted incentives to #pollute rather than #reuse. Certainly aftermarket #medtech should have #standards for #adequaterepairability. Do we need an independent #underwriterslaboratory to set up standards for #adequaterepair? Maybe a state land grant university with public funds that is immune from private sector donors with an intetest in preserving their hegemony over a certain link in the supply chain? What say you eff.org Cory Doctorow ?\n\nðŸ“· I have just completed a Magnum Photos course with Jonas Bendiksen titled Curiosity in Practice ðŸ˜Ž : \"Bendiksenâ€™s sharply evocative images explore themes of community, faith and identity with unsparing honesty. Over more than six hours, across 18 lessons, Bendiksen delves into a wide range of topics, covering his 20+ year career, how to navigate the industry, pitch for assignments, develop long-term documentary projects, and more\". https://lnkd.in/dehGa4VR\n\nWhat's in a sign?
