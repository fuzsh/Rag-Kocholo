        "text": "Italian Art Nouveau – Mario Borgoni, 1923\n\nThe defining art of posters\n\nPoster art has been a mainstay for defining cultural trends and styles, especially since the beginning of the 20th century. It was quickly recognized that minimal, striking designs with succinct messages and slogans, reinforced with a symbol, had the incisive power to penetrate the mass consciousness and market. Repetitive visual application went a long way to establishing a brand and building sales. The growing industrialization nourished increasing consumerism and advertising budgets which led to greater investment in the quality of artistic design and production of posters. Advertisers became highly motivated to research the foibles and attractions towards the purchasing habits of the public and learn how to capture their imagination.\n\n‘Circuit de Milan, Monza’, 1922 Poster by Aldo Mazza\n\nPrior to the emergence of the electronic media, posters had become one of the premium mediums in marketing and were one of the first forms of invasive mass advertising where the audience was confronted with the message irrespective of their interest. Posters became a powerful means for reinforcing design trends and even establishing them. The most poignant visual elements of a particular genre were extracted by advertising designers and utilized for marketing.\n\nThe contemporary poster had its genesis back in the 1840s and 1850s when the printing industry perfected colour lithography and made mass production possible. Advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas and by the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe. A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them were Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Louis Anguetin, Georges de Feure and Henri-Gabriel Ibels. Alfred Mucha helped launch the Art Nouveau movement with his Sarah Bernhardt Gismonda poster, which was an overnight success. Gradually more textural and graphic elements were introduced into poster art, along with bolder colour palettes. Tight deadlines and lower budget posters, restricted to one or two colours, led to a greater emphasis being placed on design and graphics, to maximize visual impact. This led to a new wave of artistic presentation with minimalized design, which had a natural symbiosis with simplified modernist trends that were evolving at the beginning of the century.\n\nPolitics also exploited the market penetration of posters and along with flyers became an effective means for revolutionaries to be heard, which was exemplified with their use in stirring up negative sentiment against the aristocracy during the French Revolution and was also widely used by the Bolshevics with their constuctivist posters. The growth of the movie industry at this time also led to the elaborate sized posters being developed for promotions.\n\nAs a means for discovering insights into the popular trends of the last 175 years, the poster has provided a vivid encapsulation and record of the potent visuals through different eras. The spread of new art movements were greatly enhanced by the adaption of artists to express themselves through this medium.\n\n1939 World Fair – Rocketman\n\nSwiss poster by Carl Moos\n\n1910\n\nPullman Gallery\n\nVanity Fair Cover October 1924 Poster Print by William Bolin at the Condé Nast Collection\n\nItalian Bugatti sports car poster, 1910\n\n‘Le Sourire’ magazine\n\n1933\n\nThe Black Cat movie poster\n\n1950\n\nVogue magazine “Jazz Age” cover – William Bolin\n\n1900\n\nperpetual purveyors of style\n\nArt Deco poster print\n\n1930’s\n\nAbstract poster 1954 – Le Corbusier\n\n‘Bauhaus Nude’ – Sharkaholic\n\nDeviant Art\n\nNew Orleans Jazz Festival – James Michalopoulos\n\nArt4Now – 2001\n\n30’s Telefunken Art Deco\n\nAnis Del Tigre, Spain\n\nCafe Nitro by Michael L.
