        "text": "A HISTORY OF GRAPHIC DESIGN Chapter 11 – <strong>Art</strong> <strong>Nouveau</strong> SUMMARY This chapter focuses on art nouveau, the transitional style that bridged the aesthetic confusion <strong>of</strong> the Victorian era and modernism. <strong>Art</strong> nouveau thrived from about 1890–1910 and encompassed all the design arts—architecture, furniture, product design, fashion, and graphics. Frequent design motifs included vine tendrils, flowers (such as the rose and lily), birds (particularly peacocks), and the human female form. The main identifying visual quality <strong>of</strong> art nouveau was an organic, plantlike line. Because <strong>of</strong> its decorativeness, some observers see art nouveau as an expression <strong>of</strong> latenineteenth-century decadence; others, however, noting art nouveau’s quest for spiritual and aesthetic values, see it as a reaction against the retrogression and materialism <strong>of</strong> the epoch. Among the numerous sources that have been cited for art nouveau are the tendrilous, curvilinear networks that unified Emile Tassel’s townhouse designed by Belgian architect Baron Victor Horta, and the French symbolist movement in literature, with its rejection <strong>of</strong> realism in favor <strong>of</strong> the metaphysical and sensuous. Other influences include William Blake’s book illustration, Celtic ornament, the rococo style, the <strong>Art</strong>s and Crafts movement, Pre-Raphaelite painting, Japanese decorative design (especially ukiyo-e woodblock prints), as well as the swirling forms <strong>of</strong> Vincent van Gogh, the flat color and stylized organic contour <strong>of</strong> Paul Gauguin, and the Nabis group <strong>of</strong> young artists who explored symbolic color and decorative patterns. This chapter covers French and English art nouveau, the influence <strong>of</strong> French and English art nouveau in America, and innovations that took place in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Emphasis is on the design <strong>of</strong> posters, books, periodicals, trademarks, and typefaces. The chapter begins with a survey <strong>of</strong> Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, which provided European and North American artists and designers with new approaches to space, color, drawing conventions, and subject matter. European artists drew inspiration from the calligraphic line drawing, abstraction and simplification <strong>of</strong> natural appearances, flat color and silhouettes, unconventional use <strong>of</strong> bold black shapes, and decorative patterns, as well as the practice <strong>of</strong> reducing subjects to graphic interpretations that conveyed their essence, and suggestive impressions rather than detailed depictions. Among the Japanese artists who made contributions to the genre were Hishikawa Moronobu, the first master <strong>of</strong> the ukiyoe print, Kitagawa Utamaro, unrivaled in his portrayal <strong>of</strong> beautiful women, the prolific Katsushika Hokusai, and Ando Hiroshige, the last great master whose spatial compositions and ability to capture transient moments <strong>of</strong> the landscape inspired the European impressionists. French art nouveau had its beginnings in Paris in 1881 with Jules Chéret and Eugène Grasset, after a new French law that lifted censorship restrictions led to a booming poster industry. Chéret, considered the father <strong>of</strong> the modern poster, designed lithographic posters for music halls, the theater, beverages and medicines, household products, entertainers, and publications. The beautiful young archetypal women he featured in his posters were dubbed Chérettes. Swiss-born Grasset rivaled Chéret in popularity and is noted for his total integration <strong>of</strong> illustration, format, and typography and what has been called his “coloring-book style,” a thick black contour drawing that locked forms into flat areas <strong>of</strong> color. His flowing line and floral motifs pointed toward French art nouveau. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec broke new ground in poster design in his posters for Paris cabarets, with their simple symbolic shapes and dynamic spatial relationships. His friend and sometimes rival Théophile-Alexandre Steinlein was a prolific illustrator who <strong>of</strong>ten depicted poverty, exploitation, and the working class. His commissions included magazine covers, magazine and book illustrations, sheet music, and large posters. But art nouveau found its most comprehensive statement from 1895 until 1900 in the work <strong>of</strong> young Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, whose dominant theme was a central female figure surrounded by stylized forms derived from plants and flowers, Moravian folk art, Byzantine mosaics, and even magic and the occult. Mucha’s women project an archetypal sense <strong>of</strong> unreality—exotic, sensuous, yet maidenlike, they express no specific age, nationality, or historic period—and their stylized hair patterns became a hallmark <strong>of</strong> the era. Pattern books, such as Combinaisons ornementales produced by Mucha in"
