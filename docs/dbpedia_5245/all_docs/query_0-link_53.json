        "text": "This is a bit of an introductory post, but what better way to do that than to introduce a brand new save. Avid FM player for years and having read the Guadalajara thread I felt a bit inspired to do a story of my own. Do not be expecting things on that level, as that's a level of detail that even I cannot bring myself to get into, although I am totally for it and have found it a superb read - easily relateable for me too as I did a fantastic save on FM20 with FC Andorra (an early rival of his by the looks of things), so I can totally appreciate the strains of the lower leagues of Spanish football.\n\n---\n\nFC Andorra was one of my favourite saves ever. To summarise, it went a bit like this...\n\n- First season, expected to go up to the 2nd tier, but it is a very tricky league system in the lower leagues of Spain and we had the misfortune of having Barcelona B in our league. Even winning the league didn't guarantee you promotion. That said - we capitulated pathetically after a largely unconvincing league campaign and didn't make the play-offs anyway.\n\n- Second season, I overhauled the squad, it was the second season in a row, with a different team, that I had suffered a late capitulation towards the end of the season and this riled me up to a point that I introduced a strict transfer policy. I became obsessed with players who relish big matches. I'm not standing for any more capitulation. We got promoted, won both rounds of play-offs and were crowned third tier champions.\n\n- Third season, we had the leagues smallest budget and ended up getting promoted again. The transfer policy was doing bits. I modelled my team on a Burnley / Getafe like side - pretty physical, gritty and aggressive. That was the vision I had for Andorra. The pirate ship and the grim reaper became unofficial nicknames. We were topping the foul and yellow card charts every season. It might not have been what Pique had in mind when he bought the club, but there were no doubting the results.\n\n- La Liga consisted of some incredibly tense situations where we narrowly avoided the drop, including the most remarkable comeback that saw us take just 3 points from our opening 15 games and survive with a goal 15 minutes from the end of the season. We eventually landed a couple of 7th placed finishes and had European runs, one including a 3-0 loss at KV Mechelen that we ended up turning around in Andorra, before Marseille put us out of the Europa Conference in the semis - the first real big game we had failed to deliver in. Eventually, we petered out to a bit of a midtable side and I just fancied moving on. It was only once I managed Hamburg, Leicester & Las Palmas afterwards that I truly appreciated what I had done at Andorra with such a tiny budget, a small database (by accident) and frankly, poor squad. No trophies, but a ride like no other.\n\n---\n\nI have done another game with them on this years, and it has followed a quite similar pattern. But there is a case to say never go back. It just isn't quite as fun as last time. I think the ride of what happened last time made it so much more fun - I have barely even scratched the surface on the ups and downs we went through. I just don't think you can quite recreate that.\n\nSo I move to a club at a similar level. They are, like Andorra, a pretty new name at their level, having gotten promoted from the 4th tier last season...\n\nAs you can see - they are a pretty tinpot club. The stadium is a decent size for the size of the club, but this is the highest level they have ever played at. This one will be tricky, but the aim ultimately is to progress as far as we can - to hopefully bring continental football to Annecy, like the previous tenants of the stadium Evian TG couldn't!\n\nEarly impressions / aims\n\nSo from having a bit of a look around, Annecy can be best described as pretty miniscule. I thought Andorra were a tight ship money wise, but these are something else. This really will be a test of my ability to make something from nothing. It is worth pointing out that the wages in this league are generally tiny, and I'm too early into the season for the game to generate the league table of wages, but in a league of very low wages ours are just about the lowest. Our highest earner is on £825 a week.\n\nI do think I am going to be forced into utilising the loan market. You can have a squad as big as you like and 5 players in on loan - we currently have nobody on loan so that gives me an opportunity to fix our squad for this season. The aim this season I think is simply survival although the board, bizarrely, want a top half finish. I don't think it's beyond us, but I really don't see why it should be any more than survival. I suppose aiming high isn't a bad thing, providing I don't pay for it with my job should I fail.\n\nIt is a quite cut-throat league with 4 of the 18 dropping, but we are predicted to finish in 14th place so I would like to think that with a few loanees we can make that a certainty. Given the length of contracts at this level also appear to be pretty short, I envisage a situation where I am likely to have a very busy summer next time around where I will probably have double figures for incomings and outgoings, although I ultimately want to follow a transfer model that sees us focus on bringing on players we can sell on for a profit, with the occasional experienced leader. We barely have a pot to **** in as things stand. I also think I will retain that desire for attracting players who perform in the big games. I think it's arguably a bit simplistic to say my success at Andorra and others was solely down to that, but it cannot be a coincidence that we improved notably as a result of it. Ultimately if you can't handle pressure, then you're going to achieve nothing in the end anyway.\n\nFurther delving into the club, we're also pretty understaffed:\n\nNow for some reason, we have more coaches than we're allowed to have, and it's a little naughty but I am going to keep it that way as I'd sooner have that relatively high level of coaching at the club, looking at the bottom graph I'd say we probably have the best coaching in the division already, which is surprising.\n\nNo scouts or physios is something I quite like as well oddly providing I get it fixed immediately, which is my first priority - particularly with scouts, I'm very fussy with who comes in for that role, what is the point of having a scout with poor judgement?\n\nI won't go into real depth with my tactics although I am sure somewhere along the line, it will be mentioned. I am fairly conventional, I used to use the template tactics on the game but I've come around to the thinking that having just 3/4 instructions is the way forward. I like balanced sides and can appreciate any style if it works - the real purist if you ask me, not one of these who calls themselves that just because they love 80% possession a game.\n\nI'm quite looking forward to getting into this, with plenty of time coming up and little on the agenda this Christmas, what better than a new FM save.\n\nEdited December 18, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nWe made swift moves in the summer to bring in some scouts and physios. In came scouts Gilles Camara, Sebastien Remy and Patrice Monteilh, as well as physio Anthony Mignante. Nothing too special, but as good as we were going to get in our current situation. I intend to upgrade on all of these when I can, but they are going to do for now.\n\nHaving had a look through the squad, we were quite well suited to play a 4-2-3-1 system similar to what I had played at FC Andorra.\n\nAs you can see below, what I like to do ultimately is to have the same system, but two versions of it that are parralel to each other - allowing for changing during a game, or to fit in other personnel. One thing I like to do is have what I call my RBA LWA & LBA RWA system. What this means is that I will have my wingers and full backs on a operating so that one of them is on an attack option, and the other a support. I think the images below will better demonstrate what I mean.\n\nTo me this retains a balance to the side yet allows for us to make a subtle change in a game if we need to. It's proven an effective way of working for me for a while, and I think it will come in handy here. I have nothing too special about my tactics, I generally try and stay a quite organised side that always has a bit of a threat on the break, particularly as an underdog like we are likely to be.\n\nRegarding signings, we have a simply pitiful wage budget. Transfer budget isn't even going to be something we can think of for another 2/3 years at least in my opinion, not until we have generated some money ourselves, but the wage bill is tiny - just £600k a year (£12k a week), for some context, Barrow, the smallest wage budget in League Two, have one of £1mil a year. We are operating on a non-league of England budget.\n\nThis limits us to loans and frees. I was prepared to give a lot of my players a chance - I actually think a lot of them are steady for how low their wages are, I'm quite fussy with signings as a general rule, and when you take over a club and sport the obvious overpayments it feels easy to make some progress. It's tougher here, there are some steady players who are probably worth more than what they're on. The objective however is just to remain in the league, get some younger players signed and build for future seasons, hopefully to be promoted in my 3rd year - maybe sooner if we can pull something off next year. The following all came in on part-time deals. None of the permanent signings will feature in the first team this season, bar possibly Antonio, but he's still a way down the pecking order.\n\nBossiwa joined on loan due to an injury to my first choice left winger, that exposed how thin our squad actually is in that position. I don't want to bring too many in though, as we can only name five subs, and like I say, our squad isn't 'total' rubbish.\n\nWe have made a steady start to life in this league.\n\n6th after 6 games is pretty impressive, consisting of a couple of really decent wins over sides expected to be up there - given the majority of our opposition were predicted to be in the top 6 this year it's very hard to knock how we've started. We appear to have goals in the team, and bar one pretty abject collapse at Concarneau (their only win, annoyingly) we have been fairly strong at the back too. My only worry is we seem to have scored quite a few goals from distance. The Sete win for example was ridiculous, a 0-3 win with an xG of just 0.81 a sign of our overperformance in that regard, especially considering the majority of that came at 0-3! The Le Mans win has easily been the pick of our performances so far, the favourites to win the league and we gave them a serious pasting, we were very good there. The standout performer so far has been Migouel Alfarela;\n\nIt is too early to really say where we will end up, but I am pretty confident that we're going to be clear of the drop. Bizarrely the Concarneau loss has satisfied me a little as after the Le Mans win, I was starting to wonder if this is a bit easy, following having a similar pattern with Andorra. I want us to struggle a bit, in a really backwards way, as I feel it's far more rewarding when you eventually get anywhere. Either that, or my system is just really effective.\n\nEdited December 20, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nOctober went pretty well - looks clear to me that the system is paying off with very few goals conceded this month. The Avranches win was a particular high as they were flying quite high at the time and we made light work of them, Romain Spano starting to take over as our key performer up front. I had the choice of picking him and ex-Liverpool striker Anthony Le Tallec, the latter was higher rated but I don't really want to build a system around a 36 year old who is likely to go off a cliff. Spano is just a steady all-round striker for this level.\n\nWe progressed in the cup. The ideal scenario with the cup is that we get a bit of a run together and land a big home tie when the bigger teams come in. We have a stadium that holds 16,000 but we average an attendance of just 957 - which sounds pathetic but it's actually only as low down as 11th in this league, which kind of sums up the total lack of depth in the league. Le Mans average 8,000 which is comfortably the highest - they're the club who really ought to be getting promoted this year, but I have a sneaky suspicion about us, we're clearly not going down and the manner of the comeback away at league leading Bourg-Peronnas has planted the idea in my head. I am not too concerned by it this year, it would be a massive overachievement, but for all our resources are tiny, it seems like the league in general is full of clubs in a similar boat and we're not as relatively tiny as I thought we were.\n\nOur league form has definitely dried up a little, particularly the goals. We have played a string of 4th tier teams in the cup but the way we have taken a couple of them apart has been impressive - with minutes given to some of the new 18 year old signings like Wiltord Antonio and Elamine Moussa, Antonio particularly impressive and I think he will be a decent player for us.\n\nThe two home defeats in the league were annoying. No complaints about losing to SC Lyon, we were missing players but the performance was abject and we deserved nothing. I couldn't explain the Cholet loss though, quite literally as well as we've played all season and we ended up losing 0-2, the xG of 2.12 - 0.48 sums up what a silly result that was. Ultimately though, we don't have a great deal of quality, and it shouldn't be totally surprising. I don't really rate my keeper either, who was beaten from distance twice, both very saveable shots as well.\n\nI think that table kind of sums the league up (well, obviously), there is no real pattern to it, a 7 point gap between the league leaders and 12th is the kind of thing you would expect 4 or 5 games in, not nearly half way. Simply I think if we don't pick up loads of injuries, we won't be anywhere near the bottom 4, but I think we're a bit too limited to get promoted. What's good is that in some positions, we're quite well covered even by some of the 18 year olds - Antonio as mentioned has slotted in fine and there's a case to just keep playing him anyway. Promotion would be a real achievement, but I think it may be a little beyond us, and I expect someone like Le Mans, disappointing as they have been, to really pick up and probably win the league. You never know though. Steady is the way I would describe us, and I am happy with that.\n\nThis is a bit worrying though. We spend very little but we generate next to nothing. We get 950 fans a game. However, the one thing I really wanted - we got it.\n\nPerfection. We couldn't have asked for a better draw. We've no chance at all of winning it yet have landed one of the biggest clubs in the country, and hopefully, we sell the game out. That really is a possible gamechanger for this save, this game could literally double our ticket revenue for the season.\n\nI'd rate this as an 8/10 season at the minute. It's very hard to criticise anything really. Overachieving in the league, still in the cup and got just about the best draw in it. I will probably do another couple of updates this season, and really start to introduce the players beyond just their names, as I appreciate - nobody knows who they are.\n\nA funny side note is that we're comfortably the leagues dirtiest team. The most fouls and yellow cards in the league, taking after my Andorra side in style, this wasn't the aim, but it's kind of working I suppose?\n\nEdited December 21, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nWe're really hard to beat and have gone on an 8 game unbeaten run throughout the latter winter months - though of course the obvious caveat is we've drawn more than we have won. The form of striker Romain Spano is starting to seriously prop us up, as you can see there, he has scored in his last 5 games, the leagues form player and but for an exceptional season from Bastia-Borgo's Wilson Isidor, he'd probably win the golden boot. Not bad for a striker with a track record that reads of being a steady 4th tier striker. He's just pretty steady all-round, like a very low level complete forward.\n\nThe form of on loan Lyon winger Samuel Bossiwa is also very encouraging. He's becoming increasingly creative and is developing at the quickest rate of any of our players. I think I will try and get him back next season - promotion or not.\n\nAnd then of course, the league table;\n\nThe table remains so tight, although a little gap appears to be forming between 5th and 6th, but the fact you could wipe that gap out within a game means it's not even really worth noting and the fact I have kind of sums up how tight the table has been pretty much all season. We have done superbly well given everything, with just 4 defeats all season being the obvious plus. I think it is safe to say we won't be relegated this season - we could lose all 10 of our remaining games and probably survive, that's long beyond even being the discussion.\n\nThe lack of revenue generated by the Marseille game proves there is nothing in it for us in this league, we will merely exist and rack up losses despite hardly any spending anyway, so consolidating in this league feels almost pointless, and if we can somehow snare promotion this season, then it's worth it even if we do drop. I still think even despite how well we have done this year, we will likely have quite a big switch around in the summer as regards to incomings and outgoings, I still think we can improve what we get for our money, even with this performance. I still feel my 4-2-3-1 system is so effective. We're the better side in the majority of games we play (despite often inferior players) and if not for some concession of silly late goals we'd be pretty comfortably in a promotion place.\n\nWe do play the two teams above us still, in consecutive weeks as well annoyingly, but the majority of our last 10 games will come against bottom half sides - including fancing the bottom two at home.\n\nI am enjoying this, we've progressed quicker than I thought we would.\n\nEdited December 23, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nWell would you believe it, a bit of a no-show from us. What was interesting about that fixture is if we won, not only were we promoted, but Red Star were down and yet in pre-season, the predictions were that we'd be fighting relegation and Red Star would be fighting promotion. Quite the twist of fate.\n\nWe were pretty poor, applying most of the early pressure and we missed a golden chance, but we conceded a penalty, Bossiwa committing the offence but goalkeeper Julien Perez, a player who has been at Annecy his whole career, saved it (straight at him, which I admire, that's holding your nerve) and made another late save to deny Red Star a win - that ultimately has relegated them. A disastrous day for them.\n\nOther results mean that Bastia-Borgo can still overthrow us, and we have at least secured a top 3 place, but 3rd has a play-off game - which is likely to be against Chambly, our most local rivals, would you believe. I still think we finish this off, and if Bastia-Borgo blow their game in hand, we've secured promotion. You have to feel that was a great chance blown though.\n\n---\n\nAnd would you believe it.\n\nIt runs to the final day, and what a gutting way to miss out. There is a two week break until the final day, which is very annoying, and even worse for some reason, our game is the following day to the others!\n\nBut what a game that was in Briochin, and what a miserable night for Annecy, as failure to win for Bastia-Borgo would've seen us promoted and yet, despite going behind with 84 minutes on the clock, they have somehow pinched it.\n\nThe final day pits Bastia-Borgo v Creteil, and Orleans v Le Mans, with the following day, SC Bastia v Annecy. Some real twists of irony as two of the key games will take part in the same Corsican city.\n\nThese are the permitations.... if we win, we are champions. If we draw, we are champions should both of the other two fail to win, and promoted should only one of them win - however if we draw, and they both win, we finish 3rd as Orleans will beat us on H2H.\n\nSC Bastia, thankfully, due to their H2H record with Boulogne and the fact they and Stade Briochin face each other - are already relegated. They should make the perfect opposition, especially given we're fighting their city rivals.\n\nOur chances have taken a hit, but we're still in the driving seat.\n\nEdited December 24, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nThe playoffs\n\nTo reflect briefly, it really is a cased of mixed feelings - after spending so much of the season top of the league, effectively the entirety of 2021 so far, to finish 3rd on the final day due to a loss to an already relegated side, it's hard to take. Even when you know you have overachieved in the first place, to fall away from such a position is so poor. The Red Star draw was the first issue and the signs that we were crumbling under the pressure a bit, but that Bastia game was a disaster. We need head into the relegation playoff, where we will play two legs against the team that finishes 18th in Ligue 2 - the system they introduced in France a couple of seasons ago.\n\nAfter sending Red Star down a fortnight ago, our task was to put yet another Parisian team to the sword. Paris FC were predicted to finish 14th in their league, similarly to us, but have endured very different fortunes. A general season of misery with just 8 wins in their 38 games - scoring just 10 goals in the second half of the season. They are on a real low.\n\nThat said, a quick look through their squad, and you do realise that there is quite a gap between the two leagues. Their squad is quite comfortably stronger than ours, and we're going to have to put in a shift and a half to turn them over, even in their current state. With away goals counting, and the stadium packed (well, 18% full to be precise, rather than the usual 6%), we threw ourselves into the first leg.\n\nIt was more bad news.\n\nUnfortunately, it all just looks a step too far for us. The Marseille game back in January told me we could mix with superior teams even for our limitations, but I suppose that game had no real pressure on it and the reward for this one would be massive. I was hoping we could hold out for 0-0, which given there are away goals, would have been a very good result that gives us a small chance for the away leg, but an error from goalkeeper Perez (I cannot make my mind up on him at all) sealed an away win. Our task has just gotten much harder and the reality is, we're probably going to be facing another season in the third tier.\n\nI shifted the system for the 2nd leg. I tried to fit in just about everybody that had that 'turn up in big game' trait and hoped we could keep it tight and somehow pinch something.\n\nAnd would you believe it.\n\nLets first make the point that this was an absolutely terrible game. I thought Paris would make us really pay and go and beat us about 3-0, but it just never quite panned out that way. The plan was to keep it tight and hope that we can pinch a goal from a set piece. To say that it worked to perfection would be an understatement. That man again Romain Spano delivered not long before half time, before a very forgettable second half that resulted in extra time. We had already done a lot more than I expected, the players were tiring, but it was working. You started to sense that nerves had gotten the better of Paris. It's easy to forget that they were ultimately under the pressure, and they're a side who scores so few goals. They just hadn't turned up in this leg at all.\n\nWe approached the end of extra time and I was planning a double substitution to get my two best penalty takers on the bench onto the pitch. Tempts fate I know, but it was all or nothing at this point. Just as I went to do it, we broke again, the Paris centre half panicked, slide tackled the ball wide of his own keeper and Spano tapped into an empty net. I'm not aware of all of the history of this club, but in terms of their best moments, this surely has to be up there. The 300 strong travelling contingent went mental, the coaches and subs were on the pitch (the latter probably relieved at no longer having to take a penalty!), we had surely done it. Don't forget that away goals counted and that Paris would need 2 in the last minute to come back. We were there. I gave us next to no chance, and yet somehow, we did it.\n\nMore to follow!\n\nSEASON REFLECTION\n\nThought I would go through some of the things that underpinned the season....\n\nPlayer of the season\n\nThis was quite an easy pick. It had to go to Romain Spano, quite significantly my top scorer and in hindsight definitely the right decision to make him my first choice striker over Anthony Le Tallec. Le Tallec possesses more natural talent, but at the age of 35 he was always likely to decline during the season and despite playing his part, Spano justified my faith returning 20 goals in 34 league games, and 25 in 39 in all competitions, including both goals in the win at Paris FC. Spano is a steady all-round striker, no major strengths, no major weaknesses, he's a really quite rounded striker but that seems to be exactly what we needed rather than any particular specialist. He will play a role in Ligue 2, signing a new two year contract.\n\nHonorable mentions also go to centre backs Matthieu Sans and Fabien Boyer. Though now 32 and 30 respectively, they formed a really solid partnership at centre back, Boyer made the league team of the season and Sans made the bench. Goalkeeper Julien Perez, somebody who has spent his whole career at the club, made the team of the season. Though he has an error in him I think he made up for it with plenty of other good performances, including at home to Red Star and away at Paris. Ahmed Kashi was also pretty pivotal, and I would guess that he probably held the best win % in our whole team.\n\nWhere next for my squad / what do we need\n\nWith nearly everybody out of contract (bar bizarrely two of my older players in Sans and Pinto-Borges), we need to have a bit of a reshuffle. Some players have earned a go, but some simply will be out of their depth and we sadly have to let them go. Our wage budget has gone up to £18k a week (which is still terrible) but the transfer budget is £1.1mil, somehow, though realistically I'm going to plunge the majority of that into wages.\n\nIn goal we have Julien Perez and Lucas Mocio. Perez is first choice with Mocio backup. My plan simply is to release Mocio, and have Perez battle out with a new goalkeeper.\n\nIn defence, I do plan to give both Sans and Boyer a go, but we need better cover. I wasn't impressed with anybody bar those two and I think we need two more centre halves. I will be aiming for younger players, hopefully permanent players, but I'm not totally against loans although I don't wish to become too reliant on them. Right back Alhassane Sylla did well and I intend for him to keep his place, though I am never averse to signing replacements. We certainly need a left back though. Youngster Elamine Moussa, my signing, did reasonably well when called on, but the initial first choice Nicolas Garby was terrible and he will be massacred at this level, so it's a priority position. My other backup Romauld Marie was also by and large pretty terrible when he featured, age is on the wrong side also.\n\nIn midfield, Kashi is good enough in my opinion to step up. He largely set the tone for how we played - kept things ticking nicely, a yellow card enthusiast, aggressive and loves a big game. I'm a fan. Pinto-Borges isn't good enough but he stays because he has another year left, no idea how he got a longer term deal at his age. Roger Tamba can stay although has sadly developed the big game bottler syndrome, but he's a good all-round midfielder and worth keeping around in my opinion. The cover is pretty shoddy too, so I think we need probably three more midfielders, preferably a first choice playmaker to partner Kashi, and another box to box type, and an anchor man as I feel we're going to be forced into 4-3-3 a lot more next season, and we didn't really have the options to perform that last year.\n\nThe wide options are not far off sorted, though I think we could possibly do with another right footed wide man who can play either side as nobody can really play that AML position cutting in. Alfarela was a pretty key player really and I didn't give him enough credit in the previous section. Wiltord Antonio is a steady young winger and I even started him at Paris for the fact he's already our best natural right winger.\n\nStrikers, Spano as stated has signed a new deal, and despite his decline I still think Le Tallec is worth keeping around for a year, but we do need another option and I think we've found the perfect man already, a young Cameroonian striker is set to join, but more will be covered next season.\n\nSo to summarise, my target signings are;\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nYoungish centre back x2\n\nYoungish right back\n\nFirst choice left back\n\nAnchor man\n\nPlaymaker type\n\nBox to box midfielder\n\nWinger - plays either side, right footed\n\nStriker\n\nOther points\n\n- FC Annecy were the dirtiest team in the league. This wasn't actually the plan, but I think the system that was so effective at Andorra being carried over meant there was always going to be an element of that. I do think I just naturally like a bit of aggression in my teams, though it isn't the plan really to kick every other team off the pitch. For some numbers, we picked up 70 yellow cards, pipping Bourg-Peronnas and Bastia-Borgo (two other high finishing teams) to the top of the leaderboard. We made 655 fouls, which was the most in the division by quite a distance, Bastia-Borgo the next highest with 542. The really surprising part about this though, is that we were one of only six sides to not have a red card all season. Foul smart I suppose!\n\n- We were 3rd for possession. I've never been a big possession manager, but I'm not anti-possession either, I just don't place loads of emphasis on how much you have and more the content of what you do with the ball. I'm happy to win with 20%, I'm happy to win with 80%. Ahmed Kashi is more and more appearing to be our Fernandinho.\n\n- We had the 3rd highest expected goals for in the league, and the best expected goals against ratio, which is a huge testament to our system really. I think we just have to build around this for now.\n\n- We were 15th out of 18 in the wage budget category - but league winners Bastia-Borgo were bottom!\n\nEdited December 24, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nTime for another update, to say things have gotten interesting would be an understatement, but there is an ever growing feeling at the back of my mind that I'm not liking about this save, and I'll come to it (though if you saw me in another thread you can guess what it is).\n\nNow lets not beat around the bush, we have been quite simply - excellent.\n\nWe are continuing the solidity at the back. The signing of Manuel Mane in-particular has been pivotal in my opinion in allowing us to play the 4-3-3 DM with such efficiency - providing an excellent shield to the centre backs while the two in front of him carry us forward to the front three.\n\nThe anchor man is for me, one of the most under-praised roles on the game. It is routinely useful in making you a tough side to beat, offers you immense protection without even having to do anything special. I've always been a fan of it, and this save is once again showing me why.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out some other things;\n\n- I do seem to have a bit of a problem getting form from my full backs, but I wonder if it's the rating system, because they are by and large doing the job I want from them, picking their moments carefully and providing good movement to help us open a team up whilst remaining solid at the back. I think this is a quite common thing.\n\n- My new goalkeeper, Yannis Clementia, has been a revelation - he has faced two penalties, saving both, an upgrade on a pretty inconsistent Julien Perez, who I feel will try to get a move as he's growing concerned at his lack of playing time.\n\n- Alfarela, Bossiwa, Sans, Boyer, Spano and Sylla have all made the step up. None have let me down.\n\n- For somebody who does look at particular details, I am pretty ashamed to admit it took me until December to notice new centre back Ruben Droehnle was left footed. Two left footed centre halves never works. I don't know why, but it just doesn't, so he becomes my longer term Boyer (left footed) replacement rather than Sans (right footed) replacement. Every game he has played on the left side, he has been what I thought he would be - dependable and solid. Boyer is about to go to the cup of nations with Madagascar too, so Droehnle will get a proper run and, to be honest, I don't think Boyer will dislodge him again.\n\n- Diego Michel has been a bit of a revelation for me, but not quite in the way I expected. Though I did actually sign him for what he would offer out wide, he has been far more effective centrally and since moving to the mezzalla role, he's been terrific. Benard and Mane as previously alluded to, likewise, are doing very well too - Kashi can't even get in my team anymore, and we have another central midfielder lined up too as the ageing Steven Pinto-Borges will move to the lower leagues of Holland in January.\n\n- I think the comparison between us and Bastia-Borgo, the most comparable club to us, is the greatest demonstration of how good a season we are having.\n\n---\n\nHowever, what I alluded to earlier. There is a bleak side to this for me, it's an elephant in the room, and I'd appreciate people's input here.\n\nThis is, quite bluntly, too easy.\n\nLets just strip this bare for a minute here. I have taken over a relegation candidate in the third tier of France with one of the worst budgets in the league. I have implemented a tactic I created myself, it is a well-balanced tactic, it is simplicity, I don't like to complicate things, I never have done, I'll show you below what I primarily use now;\n\nIt is in my eyes, a pretty good system, it is nothing special, but it is steady all over the pitch, there are no major weaknesses and we usually have all areas covered, we transition well, we don't allow many chances, we create enough of our own.\n\nBut should it really be taking a team as poor as mine this far? This is a side that even now, would not be the strongest in the third tier, and yet we look like we have a good chance of being promoted to Ligue 1.\n\nI think one thing that put me off my Andorra save was I felt it was a little simple, the repetition of the save was a factor, but that was another - yet now I've had this play out at Annecy, I really am starting to feel that we're overachieving to a point it doesn't even feel realistic.\n\nEven despite all I say about my 'keeping it simple' approach - I've still been often playing a centre back on the total wrong side, totally ruining the balance of the team and seeing him constantly let me down as a result - and yet I've even gotten away with that. That kind of thing should be costly.\n\nI have also barely even played Marc Medou. For all of Spano's efforts - Medou is better already, even at 18, yet I'm not the sort to change a winning team around much. Medou has started 2 games for me.\n\nSo I'm asking you people - am I playing this game really well? I think I play it logically - sensible transfers, a solid formation, a good man manager who will get the players on side and keep them there, but I don't do anything that should have a club with such pitiful resources, and players, anywhere near this good?\n\nAre you people struggling with your saves at all of a similar level? Or are you also finding it a bit simple?\n\nI will play on, it's not enough to put me off it, but it's less rewarding than it should be and as backwards as it is, I almost would feel a bit more satisfaction if we sat 11th.\n\nEdited December 30, 2020 by Dan1884\n\nSEASON REFLECTION\n\nPlayer of the season: I usually will go off what the game says, and once again, it's Romain Spano who claims the award, whilst once again being the clubs top scorer. Though nowhere near as strong as last season, he had a good year. 14 goals in all competitions (all coming in the league) with 7 assists as well. You cannot knock how he did really, though there is something interesting that I have noticed about us and I will touch on it a bit later. This POTS wasn't as clear a winner as last year - DIego Michel, Clement Benard, Yannis Clementia and Baye War also deserve honorable mentions.\n\nNew signing performance:\n\nThe good: The four aforementioned contenders for player of the season all had strong years, as did Manuel Mane. Mane - Benard - Michel was our midfield for most of the season, keeping out the likes of Ahmed Kashi and Roger Tamba despite their previous steady displays. The midfield was the pick of our team this season, really. Baye War I think is going to be our best player, and has made a promising start to his time here, though our poor form coincided with his arrival. It would be very harsh to link the two though, as he generally performed well. Yannis Clementia booted Julien Perez out of the side and after a chat with Perez, an agreement for him to leave has been reached.\n\nThe average: Kevin Rodet the young midfielder stayed in the reserve side but didn't really play much. In all honesty I don't expect him to make it here, but it's worth keeping him for just another year to see if he does progress as there aren't great alternatives. Marc Medou was a bit of an enigma. I think he's actually better than Spano, but Spano always seemed to do just about enough to keep himself in the side, and when I finally gave Medou a run, he ended up injured after two good games. I have quite high hopes for Medou though and think he will come good next year, he has only just turned 19.\n\nThe bad: I've put three players in here. Samba Samake the right back, Cheick Keita the left back, and Ruben Droehnle the centre back. Samake has a very poor average rating, Keita was truly awful and to be honest was an error from me, he hasn't improved one bit since I signed him after initially thinking he'd lost his way a bit and needed a club like us where he would be first choice. Droehnle just never really performed and was for me, the biggest disappointment relative to expectations. I will give him another try, but I wasn't impressed.\n\nPoints of note:\n\nHaving a bit of a look through the stats, I found some interesting things about us this year...\n\n- We're still a dirty team. Bastia-Borgo topped the charts this year, but we were not far behind them at all. For some context BB got 95 yellow cards, we got 90, and the next highest had 59. I think there's a strong element of it being because we do lack the technical quality of many of our opposition and we play in such a way that spoils the game as a bit of a neutraliser. Bastia-Borgo were similar, they just weren't anywhere near as effective. Likewise with fouls - Bastia-Borgo committed 713, we committed 690, and the next was 473.\n\n- We are so much better away than at home it is scary. We had the leagues best away record (11-6-2) which is, lets be fair, pretty remarkable for a club of our budget. That is very much a promotion away record. The next best team had 7 less points. The flip side is while you could argue our away form saved us from trouble, you could argue our home form cost us promotion. Our home record was 5-4-10, 18th in the league and better than only the two sides so blatantly out of their depth. We also lost our last 6 home games, which is a worry.\n\n- We conceded 9 penalties. This again was only better than Ajaccio and Bastia-Borgo.\n\n- Our expected goals for was 10th, our expected goals against was 10th, so on that basis, we overperformed a little.\n\n- This was the one that really interested me. We created the most clear cut chances in the division. There is a real case to say that Spano actually held us back, though I think he did his fair share in the build up too, so it's probably a little unfair on him. It does pose the question though that if we did have slightly better finishing, how big a difference could it actually make? I think Medou will get more gametime next season, that is my plan anyway.\n\nWhere to strengthen:\n\nI have identified a few key areas, and my summer I hope will look something like this...\n\nGK - Young backup to replace Perez. I will potentially bring two in as there is no depth in this position at all at the club, and as stated, Perez is leaving.\n\nLB - Keita simply isn't good enough. I think we need a new first choice left back with him becoming backup.\n\nCB - This season we had four, Sans, Boyer, Droehnle and Vernet. Sans did well but is getting older. Boyer likewise, Droehnle wasn't really good enough, Vernet just isn't ever going to be. For me we need a new young centre back, preferably somebody who could replace Sans.\n\nCAM - This is not a top priority, but I think we need to rotate formations a little better and nobody is really that creative in that position anymore.\n\nRW - We need another winger to replace the departing Bossiwa. I don't want to become reliant on loanees, and I think although Alfarela has done well in that position, he isn't 'really' that good, and somebody of a similar playing style but with better attributes will make quite a difference.\n\nPotentially others, but they are my main priorities. You could potentially add a right back to this, and a striker perhaps as Le Tallec is going this time. Next season I think is about consolidation in the league - to strengthen the squad, bring in some more younger players, but just avoid relegation. The fact my players were insulted for me to suggest they were even capable of survival next year (despite coming 7th) suggests we did overachieve and we need to strengthen.\n\nThe rest of football\n\nFrance: PSG collected another title, just the 20 point gap this time to 2nd placed Lille. The real shocks came below those two though as Stade Brestois came 3rd, qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers. Metz also defied the odds to finish 4th, with Lyon and Marseille making up the rest of the top six. Lille beat PSG in the cup final. Montpellier and Le Havre went down, and Lens may join them if they fail to overcome Toulouse in the play-off final.\n\nOther leagues: Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Benfica all won their leagues in a totally predictable year. There really was such an absence of surprise in this season bar what happened in France - there seriously isn't really one side that I would say finished in a position of note, perhaps arguably Hertha Berlin making the Champions League.\n\nContinental: Inter won the Champions League, beating Atletico Madrid in the final, the only real notes were both Milan sides seem to have gotten their act into gear as they both made the last 8, Inter of course going all the way. Athletic Club beat Hertha in the Europa League final. Lazio beat Gladbach in the Europa Conference League final. The French teams delivered another poor season in Europe.\n\nNew signings and our start\n\n22 hours ago, Dan1884 said:\n\nWhere to strengthen:\n\nI have identified a few key areas, and my summer I hope will look something like this...\n\nGK - Young backup to replace Perez.

The fact my players were insulted for me to suggest they were even capable of survival next year (despite coming 7th) suggests we did overachieve and we need to strengthen.\n\nThe following came in:\n\nShea Charles - This to me was simply a fantastic coup. 18 years old and good enough to start already, will replace Sans in the XI as he's losing what little pace he had. Charles can go on to play in Ligue 1.\n\nBryand Soga - Free transfer from Cameroon, my Bossiwa replacement. He does lack pace, but he makes up for it with some of his technical attributes and I think he will be a good fit for us.\n\nHyapoute Djiba - Free transfer, my backup to Clementia. I think he's yet another good one for a free. Julien Perez departed to newly promoted Concarneau.\n\nAlex Kpakpe - Another promising youngster, probably too soon to start him regularly this season, but he's developing already and I think he's likely to take Droehnle's place.\n\nSouleymane Diaby - We replaced Keita, and broke our transfer record in order to do so, paying £200k for the left back. He represents a quite significant upgrade in this position.\n\nRayan Sroler - I paid £120 for him, that is no typo, one hundred and twenty pounds. For me he was worth a go at such a small price.\n\nMiccoli - I wanted him last season but couldn't do a deal, however he came for a very small fee in the end. He strengthens our midfield.\n\nWhether we had done enough to arrest the slump we found ourselves in last season - we were to find out.\n\nWell, once again, I must stress, be careful what you wish for.\n\nWe aren't looking good.\n\nYou already get the feeling that this is going to be a really arduous, dogfight of a season and I'm pretty much 50/50 on if we are going to make it or not.\n\nThe positive is that despite being winless, we're still above 6 other teams, and have only lost twice. So we're keeping things tight, you can at least say.\n\nBut there is a real dearth of quality in our game, and I'm losing faith in the overall process put in place simply because I find myself wanting to tweak something game by game. I don't think we have struck any kind of balance so far this season. I feel like we keep fixing one problem, and creating another.\n\nIt's good that we didn't lose away at both newly promoted sides (Laval, Concarneau) as I expect those two to be ones we're fighting with, but truth be told, I don't really think we would beat them at home either.\n\nThere has been a lot of mixing and matching for me. I've given Medou his go, and despite him getting a couple of goals, he hasn't been good enough and I think Spano has got to come back in. Suspensions have been a real problem this year as we never seem to be able to settle on an XI. There is always a drawback and it always seems to get picked up on.\n\nI suppose this is what you would expect to happen for a club of our stature in this league, but there is a worrying hint of Sheffield United about this. We really just need to win a game, soon."
