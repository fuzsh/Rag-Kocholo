        "text": "Filmed at Hotel del Coronado in 1958, “Some Like It Hot” showcased the talents of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon while also highlighting the hotel’s assets – a spectacular sun-drenched silhouette of Victorian architecture, the perfect backdrop for the film’s 1929 setting. Named the #1 comedy of all time by the American Film Institute, the movie has an honored place in film and Del history.\n\nAlthough only exterior scenes were filmed at the hotel, the interior scenes do look very Del-like (right down to the placement of the lobby elevator and stairs). This probably explains why so many “Some Like It Hot” devotees – even after seeing Hotel del Coronado for themselves – absolutely refuse to believe that the movie’s interior scenes were not filmed at the famous Southern California hotel."
