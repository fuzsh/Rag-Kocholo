        "text": "Jamie Wesley\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 5, 2023\n\n--\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nOverall, Inception is a great film. However, some of the logical fallacies to create artificial complications and suspense ruined the experience for me. Why did they not investigate Fischer thoroughly enough not to know he has a guarded subconscious? Why did Ariadne tell Cobb about the vent system so Mal could ruin the operation? She could have just taken five steps away from Cobb and radioed into the rest of the team. It was not a profound idea Cobb had. It was common sense. This is just one of the many examples that lead to my conclusion that Ariadne is the most insufferable character in this film. Nonetheless, I recommend everyone watch this film because it truly is an experience if someone does not look too far into the logistics. Bravo, Christopher Nolan.\n\nSpoilers ahead\n\nOverview\n\nInception is a super good viewing experience. It is one of those films where you do not know what is going on for the whole movie until the very end, and even then, some questions remain unanswered. I was convinced the whole film was part of Cobb’s meta dream, but I was mistaken. The idea for the film is fascinating, and Christopher Nolan captures the idea extraordinarily well. The cinematography is by far the best part of the film and was mostly unmatched at the time of Inception’s 2010 release.\n\nThemes\n\nThe prevalent themes in Inception are unresolved grief and memory. Unresolved grief is displayed through Cobb’s inability to let go of his late wife, Mal. He attempts to keep and reclaim memories of her by breaking his own rule of projecting memories into the dream world. This causes difficulties in the master plan to extract the code to Fischer’s father’s safe via inception. It suggests that not only is unresolved grief burdensome and negatively affects the traumatized person but also negatively affects those around them. One must let go of the past and the thoughts troubling them in order to move forward and better their life and the lives of others.\n\nMemory is superbly depicted in this film. Inception is essentially a commentary on how fallible memory is. It has people delving into others’ memories and planting thoughts that are not actually theirs. It shows how the human psyche can warp and contort memories and how people perceive the world. This is best depicted in the numerous times Cobb asks characters, such as Ariadne and Fischer, if they can recall the moments before their dream and their inability to do so. In a sense, it is a meta-theme of how memory is not as accurate and long-lasting as we may think, and they must be diligent in protecting and upkeeping them. More applicably, this theme is particularly profound as it relates to the inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony for this very reason.\n\nSymbolism\n\nTrains are the first form of symbolism. They symbolize how one cannot run away from the thoughts troubling them. The viewer is made aware that in Cobb’s memory, at the lowest levels, there is a train meant to kill him and his wife. A train plows through the street in the first dream designed to coerce Fischer symbolizing how malicious not voluntarily confronting one’s thoughts is.\n\nThe second source of symbolism is the spinning top. The top symbolizes the natural world and grief. Cobb uses the spinning top to show him whether he is dreaming or not. It grounds him in the real world, which illustrates people needing to keep a piece of themselves grounded in reality in order not to be lost in their fantasies. Furthermore, it symbolizes grief. Cobb’s second reason for keeping the spinning top with him is to carry his grief. The spinning top is in Mal’s safe, and after he finds it, he uses it. Moreover, it is a constant reminder of his late wife; every time he uses it, she creeps further into his psyche and, thus, dreams.\n\nThe third and final source of symbolism in Inception is the pinwheel in Fischer’s father’s safe. It symbolizes Fischer’s childhood, similar to what rosebud symbolizes in Citizen Kane. It also suggests that his father has always loved him. By keeping a piece of his son’s childhood, he shows him that he has always loved him despite what his actions and words may purport.\n\nActing\n\nThe acting in Inception is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb is a big reason why this film succeeds. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur has to be my favourite group member. Cillian Murphy as Fischer made him very dynamic and likeable. Marion Cotillard did a fantastic job as Mal and made the scene where she tries to attack Ariadne in Cobb’s dream legitimately scary. Ken Watanabe as Saito was another great casting choice and performance. Even Tom Bergener as Browning was not bad. However, where I have a problem with the acting is Tom Hardy as Eames and Elliot Page as Ariadne. These characters were annoying, and each scene with them was unenjoyable. Eliott Page being one of the main characters, really makes this film suffer. Their performances were uninteresting and uninspired."
