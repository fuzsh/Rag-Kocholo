        "text": "A brief history\n\nPlease roll your cursor over the links to the left.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the City of Petaluma, California, has served as a backdrop for Hollywood films, and in more recent times, television commercials. The reason is due to Petaluma's unusual variety of architectural types consisting of styles ranging from Victorian elegance and turn of the century farms to present day urban settings...and everything in between.\n\nThis unique collection of architecture and landscapes has resulted in Petaluma's frequent use as a location for motion picture and television productions, along with a growing reputation as 'Hollywood North'.\n\nWhat follows is a tour of locations used in some of the most noteworthy films shot in Petaluma, with frequent references to whether the sites can still be seen (most can).\n\nAs far as the commercials are concerned, the transitory nature of television makes it difficult to remember locations used in TV productions. Hundreds of commercials have been filmed in the town resulting in a frequent presence of Petaluma on television. Of particular interest are Ronald Reagan's famous 1984 Morning In America commercials which were filmed almost entirely in downtown Petaluma.\n\nMost of these films are widely available at video stores. If a film is available on DVD from Netflix, it will be so noted.\n\nWe suggest you consider an alternative browser for the most up-to-date features and best compatibility. We have found Firefox to be an extraordinary browser, Download it here for free.\n\nPetaluma Filmography\n\nThe Farmer's Daughter\n\n1947\n\nGround Zero\n\n1972\n\nAmerican Graffiti\n\n1973\n\nHeroes\n\n1977\n\nCujo\n\n1983\n\nExplorers\n\n1985\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married\n\n1986\n\nHoward the Duck\n\n1986\n\nTucker, The Man and His Dreams\n\n1988\n\nShadow of a Doubt (TV)\n\n1991\n\nBasic Instinct\n\n1992\n\nLolita\n\n1996\n\nInventing the Abbotts\n\n1996\n\nFlubber\n\n1997\n\nMumford\n\n1999\n\nTake the tour of Petaluma's film locations"
