        "text": "Chungking Express is one of the defining movies of 90s Hong Kong cinema. Directed by Wong Kar-wai and shot by Christopher Doyle, the film is a tour-de-force of space and time, chronicling love, longing, and loneliness in 90s Hong Kong. Since the movie's release, it has earned global recognition and a cult following â€“ promoted by none other than Quentin Tarantino, cited by Barry Jenkins as one of his influences for Moonlight, as well as Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. In many ways, the film is a time capsule, capturing magic and intimacy within the sprawling metropolis of a vintage Hong Kong. Let's take a look at the film's locations almost three decades later and relive the moments when we first watched the film.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Even Hollywood producers can't resist the lure of our city, check out this list of Hollywood movies filmed in Hong Kong."
