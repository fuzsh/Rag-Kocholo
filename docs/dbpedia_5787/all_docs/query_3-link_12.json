        "text": "It has been three decades since Hollywood introduced audiences to The Lost Boys, a film that cast Jason Patric and Corey Haim as a pair of brothers who encounter a gang of young vampires stalking the fictional California town of Santa Carla.\n\nFilmed almost entirely around Santa Cruz County, The Lost Boys starred Patric, Haim, and Kiefer Sutherland, years before they became household names, and unfolded around the beaches, boardwalks, and bridges of Santa Cruz. Like the forever-young teenagers at the heart of director Joel Schumacherâs celebrated scary story, many of the locations where the movie was shot live on, offering a unique opportunity to see the world of The Lost Boys firsthandâwithout the risk of running into any vampires.\n\nMark the 30th anniversary of The Lost Boys by visiting some of the Santa Cruz locations it featuresâall marked and made easy with this downloadable location map produced by the Santa Cruz County Film Commission.\n\nSanta Cruz Beach Boardwalk\n\nExtending along the coast of Monterey Bay, this famous oceanfront walkway is home to amusement park rides, shops, and music venuesâand it also provided the backdrop for countless scenes in The Lost Boys. The historic Looff Carousel is featured prominently in one of the film's earliest scenes, when Sutherland's character and his vampire gang are introduced, while the massive Giant Dipper roller coaster looms large in the background of many nighttime scenes.\n\nAtlantis Fantasyworld Comic Book Shop\n\nHaimâs character meets the eccentric Frog Brothers, played by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander, at this shop, which is actually located in downtown Santa Cruzânot on the boardwalk, as it appears to be in the film. A fixture in Santa Cruz for more than 40 years, Atlantis Fantasyworld relocated after the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 destroyed the original shop, but shop owner Joe Ferraraâwho appeared as an extra in The Lost Boysâstill runs the store at its Cedar Street location.\n\nSanta Cruz Wharf\n\nThe longest pier on the West Coast, this half-mile wharf in Monterey Bay is featured in the film as the location of Maxâs Video Store. The shop that doubled as the video store is currently the home of the Santa Cruz Bay Company gift shop, but the buildingâs distinctive shape and entrance will likely be familiar to eagle-eyed Lost Boys fans.\n\nPogonip Clubhouse\n\nExterior shots of the rustic house where Patric and Haimâs characters live with their mother and grandfather actually feature the clubhouse for the Pogonip Country Club. The unique property, located high in the hills above Santa Cruz, was the home of a social club, golf course, and polo club at various points over the years. Although the structure has been unoccupied for decades, it remains a popular landmark for hikers (but hopefully not vampires).\n\nThe Trestle Bridge"
