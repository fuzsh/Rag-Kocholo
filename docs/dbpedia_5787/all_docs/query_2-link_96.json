        "text": "Few novel series have had quite the contemporary success quite like the Harry Potter volumes by J.K. Rowling. The overwhelming popularity of the novels was the perfect setup for eight films based on the books, which also went on to receive critical acclaim and public admiration. In fact, when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was released, it broke the record for highest-grossing opening day for a film in history. The eight beloved movies were shot both at Warner Bros’s studios and on location all over the U.K. in England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nFrom the Dursley family house to the lake at Hogwarts, many of the filming locations are open to the public. Some even have exhibits related to the Harry Potter novels and films. Read on to learn about the locations where the Harry Potter saga was filmed.\n\nDursley House\n\nOne of the most famous locations in the Harry Potter saga is the Dursley home, located at 4 Privet Drive in the books, though the real house is located on 12 Picket Post Close in the town of Bracknell. Harry lived here, in a cupboard, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and his cousin Dudley Dursley before he departed for Hogwarts. After having to pay residents to film in this neighborhood 35 miles west of London, Warner Bros decided to build a replica of the house in a studio.\n\nPlatform 9 ¾\n\nKing’s Cross Station in London was chosen as the location for the Hogwarts Express train platform. Part of the station’s wall, between platforms 4 and 5, was used to shoot the scenes where Harry and the gang magically run through the brick barrier to access the Hogwarts Express. Now, in the filming spot, a permanent luggage cart appears to magically vanish into a wall underneath a Platform 9 ¾ sign, offering fans a photo op.\n\nThe train to Hogwarts\n\nOne of the most famous scenes from the saga is when Harry takes the train to Hogwarts, the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Glenfinnan Viaduct, completed in 1901, in Inverness-shire in the Scottish Highlands was used to bring the fantastical journey to life. As you cross the River Finnan, you travel along the viaduct located 100 feet above the water.\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron\n\nThe entrance to The Leaky Cauldron tavern is actually the door to a business on Bull’s Head Passage, in London’s Leadenhall Market. In the film, the pub is located on Diagon Alley, the popular shopping street where wizards buy their spells and potions.\n\nProfessor McGonagall’s classroom\n\nDurham Cathedral, which dates to the 11th century, was the location for more than one scene in the Harry Potter franchise. In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, it played the part of Hogwarts, and appears in a scene when Harry releases Hedwig, his owl, in a snow-covered cloister. In the second installment, the cathedral was used in a scene where Professor McGonagall teaches students the Vera Verto spell, showing them how to change animals into water goblets.\n\nHogwarts’s library and infirmary\n\nOxford’s Bodleian Library, which dates from the 17th century, is used as the restricted section of the library at Hogwarts. Bodleian’s Divinity School appears as the infirmary for the wizardry school in four of the films, featuring its elaborate vaulted ceiling.\n\nPotions class\n\nThe Cloister of Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire, England, stood in for the corridors of Hogwarts in several films, and other rooms at the abbey appeared as classrooms, including one where Professor Quirrell teaches defense against the dark arts and another where Professor Snape leads his potions class.\n\nHogwarts’s lake\n\nFinally, if you want to see the lake at Hogwarts that Harry flew over in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, or the place where Harry and friends strategize in Goblet of Fire, you need only travel 40 minutes from London to Virginia Water Lake in Surrey. Loch Shiel, in Scotland, also plays the part of Hogwarts’s lake in many scenes from the series."
