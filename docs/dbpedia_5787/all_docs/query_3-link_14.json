        "text": "The rugged beauty of the High Desert has been used as a backdrop by Hollywood and independent filmmakers since the silent days of celluloid, when \"The Original Screen Cowboy\" William S. Hart used Victorville to represent the Wild West in \"Sand\" (1920), \"White Oak\" (1921) and \"Wild Bill Hickok\" (1923).\n\nSince then, scores of movies — not just Westerns — have used the Victor Valley and Barstow as stand-ins for desolate locales. The area's cinematic tradition can't be encapsulated by a single short list of movies, so the Daily Press took a look at a sliver of that rich and dusty history and came up with five of the most notable blockbusters shot in the High Desert within the last 20 years. Some of the scenes are easily recognizable, but others may surprise even the most ardent movie buff:\n\n1. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)\n\nIn part two of Quentin Tarantino’s ultra-violent tribute to spaghetti Westerns and 1970s martial arts films, Uma Thurman’s dirt-covered heroine punches her way out of a grave before walking out of a cemetery and into a cafe where she politely orders a glass of water. That lonely cafe is Emma Jean's Holland Burger Cafe at 17143 North D Street in Victorville. No cemetery actually exists across the street from the restaurant, which has been a Victorville staple since 1947. Additionally, Tarantino didn’t roam too far from Victorville to film the infamous “Black Mamba” snake scenes. The exterior shots of the travel trailer used in that sequence were shot in Mule Canyon near Calico, about 14 miles outside Barstow.\n\n2. Erin Brockovich (2000)\n\nDirector Steven Soderbergh and megastar Julia Roberts put Hinkley on the cinematic map with the stranger-than-fiction true story of the eponymous character's struggle for small-town justice. PG&E began contaminating Hinkley’s groundwater with the cancer-causing chemical Chromium-6 in 1952, which resulted in a multi-million dollar settlement in 1996. A financial and critical success upon its release, the movie used filming locations in Barstow and on sections of the I-15 freeway. It led to Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress; however, Roberts was the only person involved to walk away with the coveted statuette.\n\n3. Contact (1997)\n\nRobert Zemeckis’ $90-million sci-fi think piece was filmed in various places all over the world, but a key scene depicting the remote Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory outside Socorro, New Mexico was actually filmed at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville. Hundreds of High Desert locals were employed as extras to portray a raucous bunch of extraterrestrial advocates hoping for an alien sighting. Judging by the sheer number of people filmed, you’re bound to know someone who was dancing atop a Winnebago circa 1996.\n\n4. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\n\nThe crew for the third film in the blockbuster \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise turned an under-construction housing tract in Victorville into the setting for Tokyo Drift's first race sequence. Stunt drivers drifted a souped-up Chevrolet Monte Carlo and a Dodge Viper SRT10 around unpaved roads, crashed them into porta-potties and even raced the Monte Carlo through the framing of a partially built home. Sadly, neither car survived the race as the confines of the construction site proved too difficult to navigate. Creators of the franchise referenced the High Desert in another \"Furious\" film: First introduced in \"2 Fast 2 Furious,\" Tyrese Gibson's character, Roman Pearce, hails from Barstow and is first seen at the Barstow Speedway (which doesn't actually exist). Upon leaving the desert town with Paul Walker's character, Roman says, \"Man, I'm not going back to Barstow\" — a proclamation to which he stayed true.\n\n5. Breakdown (1997)\n\nA breakout film for director Jonathan Mostow, “Breakdown” starred Kurt Russell as a man in search of his missing wife. Several locations in Old Town Victorville were used during filming, including a boarded-up building on 7th Street near C Street that was transformed into a bank and a telephone booth on the corner of 7th and B streets. A truck stop in the community of Lenwood, which is just south of Barstow on the I-15 freeway, was also used for filming. Mostow went on to direct “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines” (2003), which references Victorville by name but apparently didn't use the city as a filming location; Lancaster, Palmdale and Acton were used for various desert scenes."
