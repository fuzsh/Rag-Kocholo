        "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Former \"General Hospital\" actor Johnny Wactor was fatally shot in downtown Los Angeles while interrupting a catalytic converter theft, his family confirmed Sunday.\n\nThe shooting happened around 3 a.m. Saturday in the area of West Pico Boulevard and South Hope Street. LAPD investigators say three men were trying to steal a catalytic converter when the car's owner approached them.\n\nScarlett Wactor told ABC7 that her 37-year-old son was leaving work at a downtown rooftop bar and was walking with one of his coworkers when he saw what looked like someone working on his car.\n\nHe initially thought his car was being towed, she said, and he approached the person to ask if that was the case. But when the suspect looked up, he was wearing a mask, and opened fire.\n\nThree suspects fled in a vehicle, police say. Paramedics brought Wactor to a local hospital and he was pronounced dead there.\n\nWactor portrayed Brando Corbin on the ABC soap opera from 2020 to 2022, appearing in more than 160 episodes before the character was written off.\n\nGeneral Hospital issued a statement on Sunday: \"The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor's untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.\"\n\nWactor also appeared in a variety of films and TV series, including \"Station 19,\" \"NCIS,\" \"Westworld\" and the video game \"Call of Duty: Vanguard.\"\n\nAmong his other interests, Wactor's Instagram page details a fondness for outdoor sports and adventures, such as rock climbing and rodeo.\n\nTributes were pouring in from those who knew and worked with Wactor.\n\n\"Johnny Wactor was such a kind soul, a talented actor and an inspiration to those around him,\" Wactor's manager, Marco Cuadros with Immortal Artists, said. \"His professionalism, his enthusiasm and love for his craft was infectious and made him such a joy to work with. He pursued his dreams and achieved them, all the while remaining a good human being caring for others. I am proud to say I was Johnny's manager and friend. He will always be cherished in my memory. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.\"\n\nSofia Mattsson, who played Wactor's wife on General Hospital, wrote:\n\n\"My heart is so utterly broken... Johnny was the absolute best. So genuine. So caring. Incredibly hard working and humble. With a huge heart that spread so much kindness and joy. He always made sure everyone around him felt seen, heard and loved. I admire the man he was so much and I'm a better person for having known him. We shared so many special moments, both on and off screen, and I will forever cherish them deeply in my heart. You will be so incredibly missed Johnny... I'm sure you're already busy taking care of everyone up there.\""
