        "text": "1994\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nEstate, House, Party Hall, School,\n\nLocation Styles\n\nCape Cod, Construction, Mediterranean, Rustic\n\nAbout Little Rascals\n\nDirected by Penelope Spheeris and produced by Robert Simonds, the 1994 American comedy film The Little Rascals brings to life the characters from Our Gang's 1920s and 1930s short films in a contemporary action-packed adventure. The film stars Bug Hall, Kevin Jamal Woods, Brittany Ashton Holmes, Ross Bagley, Travis Tedford, Zachary Mabry, Sam Saletta, Blake McIver Ewing, and Brandon Quintin Adams.\n\nThe youngsters remain true to their classic style with traditional clothing and membership in the \"He-Man Womun Haters Club.\" Nostalgia is sure to abound, with the premise on âAlfalfaâ Switzer (Bug Hall) who starts doubting his membership in the He-Man Womun Haters Club when he falls for nine-year-old Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). The gang engages in comedic escapades and schemes to win a go-cart race and prevent Alfalfa from pursuing true love at all costs.\n\nThe Little Rascals was released on August 5th, 1994 to generally positive reviews from critics who praised its performances and nostalgic appeal. At the box office, it grossed over $67 million worldwide against its budget of $18 million, making it a commercial success. Younger viewers, in particular, may still be charmed by its lighthearted jokes and childlike tone.\n\nLittle Rascals Locations\n\nThe Little Rascals was filmed primarily in sunny Los Angeles, California. Most scenes were shot in various locations throughout the sprawling metropolis, including the 1000 Block of Figueroa Terrace, Fire Station 60 on 5320 Tujunga Avenue, and the Venice Canals Walkway. These diverse locations provided a unique backdrop to the adventures of Alfalfa (Bug Hall), Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and their friends.\n\nThe 1000 Block of Figueroa Terrace is home to towering structures and bustling traffic- an ideal setting for the clubhouse scene. Fire Station 60 on 5320 Tujunga Avenue provided a realistic look for any aspiring fireman or woman serving as LAFDâs Station 60 in The Little Rascals.\n\nAs for Venice Canals Walkway, it's a picturesque spot with lush greenery and peaceful canals that brings families together. It is featured in the scene where Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is found playing with his beloved Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes).\n\nA trip to the Little Rascals filming locations would be worthwhile for fans looking to relive their favorite moments from the beloved movie. Explore Castle Green Apartments on Raymond Avenue, where many memorable moments in the film occurred, or stroll along Pasadena's lovely streets while admiring stunning residential architecture typical of southern California.\n\nThe \"He-Man Woman Haters Club\" scenes were filmed on the rustic hillside overlooking Downtown Los Angeles, and the strategic location perfectly complemented Alfalfa (Bug Hall) and Spanky's (Travis Tedford) beloved He-Man Womun Haters Club.\n\nAs they eagerly anticipated the year's Soap Box Derby championship race against \"The Blur,\" an unstoppable undefeated racer, they placed all hopes on Alfalfa to win it for them. Yet when it came time for the announcement, his absence was conspicuous.\n\n1031 Figueroa Terrace, Los Angeles, CA provided the backdrop for the clubhouse scenes. Located in the trendy Echo Park district of Los Angeles, near the intersection of Figueroa and Glendale boulevards, it is bounded by the alluring Silver Lake to the west and Chinatown to the east.\n\nThis culturally vibrant neighborhood has gained notoriety for its trendsetting local businesses. Itâs also considered a haven amongst artists, musicians, and creatives. The locale offers stunning views of downtown Los Angeles and has become a popular movie location.\n\nSeveral transportation options are available for those wishing to visit The Little Rascals' filming location. By car, head east on Sunset Boulevard until you reach Glendale Boulevard, then turn right, heading south until you reach Figueroa Street. Make a left onto Figueroa Street and drive until you reach 1031 Figueroa Terrace.\n\nAlternatively, you can take public transportation. Take the Metro Red Line exiting at either Wilshire/Vermont or Hollywood/Western station and transfer to bus line 92 eastbound for six stops until you arrive at Glendale Boulevard/Figueroa Street. From there, transfer to bus line 200 southbound for one stop until you get to Figueroa Street/Glendale Blvd.\n\nLos Angeles Filming Locations Map\n\nOne of the unforgettable moments in The Little Rascals is the romantic date between Alfalfa (Bug Hall) and Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes) at Venice Canals. As they drift serenely down a picturesque canal surrounded by lush palm trees, Alfalfa's heartfelt rendition of \"You are so beautiful to me\" resonates with viewers.\n\nCalifornia's historical Venice Canal District provided the backdrop for this scene, and it is still immortalized in fans' hearts. The Venice Canal Historic District has made countless appearances in well-known big-screen flicks, such as A Nightmare On Elm Street and Oliver Stone's The Doors. Resembling an idyllic postcard from 1905 when developer Abbot Kinney constructed it, this area of the town remains virtually unchanged to this day, even that bridge connecting Linnie Canal to Court C, where Alfalfa and Darla shared their date can be seen exactly as it was.\n\nVisitors need only take a short drive to 213 Palms Boulevard near Windward Avenue in Los Angeles to get to this location. Numerous bridges offer great photo opportunities, but many popular attractions are accessible by foot, including the famous canals and nearby beach areas.\n\nVenice Filming Locations Finder\n\nOne of the most memorable scenes from The Little Rascals is when Buckwheat (Ross Bagley) and Porky (Zachary Mabry) rush to call the fire station when they notice their beloved clubhouse is on fire. Unfortunately, they give up when they canât remember the number for 9-1-1. Despite their best efforts, unbeknownst to them, a fire station is located directly across the street.\n\nThis sad moment has been cited numerous times throughout pop culture and it was filmed at 5320 Tujunga Ave, Los Angeles, CA 91601, in North Hollywood. This building still stands today, and visitors can see it for themselves and imagine Buckwheat and Porky rushing there to save the day.\n\nHead north on US-101 N out of downtown Los Angeles to get to this location until you reach US-101 N to Magnolia Blvd and take exit 6. Turn right onto Magnolia Blvd, then take another left onto Tujunga Ave after about 1 mile. You will find 5320 Tujunga Ave on your right, about 0.5 miles down Tujunga Ave; you can spot it easily with its distinct architecture!\n\nLos Angeles Video Shoot Locations Scout\n\nStep into a piece of history when you visit the Castle Green Apartments in Pasadena, where Spanky (Travis Tedford) famously took Alfalfa (Bug Hall) to break up with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes) during her ballet competition.\n\nBuilt over 120 years ago, this Moorish Revival architectural marvel is composed of brick and terra cotta, which adds regal elegance and charm to its three separate structures constructed between 1893-1903. Located on 99 S Raymond Avenue, it faces the Stats Floral Supply building visible in the background. The boys can be seen walking down this entrance, although the white-painted letters have since faded away.\n\nVisitors can take a self-guided tour of the building to see its famous features, including its sprawling balconies, tall gingerbread gables, large bay windows, and elaborate wooden doorways. In addition to its unique architecture, visitors can enjoy picturesque views of downtown Los Angeles from nearby Wilson Park.\n\nTo get there, if you're coming from Los Angeles, take the I-110 for approximately 15 minutes until reaching Pasadena. Then follow CA-110 N/Arroyo Seco Pkwy/Pasadena Fwy to S Arroyo Pkwy/Historic Rte 66 E in Pasadena. Afterward, drive down S Arroyo Pkwy and onto Historic Route 66 E towards S Raymond Ave, where you will find the Castle Green Apartments on your right after a few blocks.\n\nPasadena Filming Locations Exploration\n\nOne of the best scenes from The Little Rascal set in Darla's house was filmed in Burbank. In this memorable moment, Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is about to present a bouquet to Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), only for Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing) and his dog to interrupt the romantic gesture. This unforgettable anecdote has been referenced numerous times throughout movies and TV shows.\n\nThe house used for filming was 537 Delaware Rd, Burbank, CA 91504, USA. It is a private estate, so please be respectful when visiting the area. The house was painted white for the film, making it stand out against its surroundings and helping to create an ideal backdrop for the scene.\n\nExploring Burbank is an incredible experience as it includes two unique areas. One lies in the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains, while the other sits flatly on a vast plain. You'll surely get your fill of diverse landscapes and activities when you stroll through this bustling town.\n\nGetting to this location is relatively easy since it is close to several major highways, such as Interstate 5, Interstate 210, and State Route 2. Public transportation can also get you there, catch a bus or train from Los Angeles Union Station.\n\nBrowse Burbank Filming Locations"
