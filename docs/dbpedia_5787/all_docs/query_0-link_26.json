        "text": "Brian G. Brosnan\n\nBrian G. Brosnan is Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hollywood Locations and the Co-Founder, Co-Owner and Managing Partner of Los Angeles Center Studios\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Brian Brosnan left his hometown at 19 years old after attending Columbia College Film School and moved to Los Angeles, where he worked on numerous film and television productions. This eventually led to landing the position of Location Manager on the Academy Award-winning film Terms of Endearment and the Multi-Emmy Award and Golden Globe winning television series Murder, She Wrote. Having aspirations of being an entrepreneur from a very early age, his visionary spirit led him to create two very successful businesses. He created and founded Hollywood Locations in 1989, just prior to striking a deal with the Hearst Corporation to represent the historic Herald Examiner newspaper building. Hollywood Locations represented this premier movie location for 27 years. Brian co-founded Los Angeles Center Studios in 1998 with his business partner Christopher M. Ursitti. Together they partnered with Bristol Group to develop the twenty-acre campus into the largest independent film studio in Los Angeles. Brian’s notable career has spanned almost 40 years in the entertainment industry.\n\nHollywood Locations is now the industry leader in film location management, celebrating its twenty-eighth anniversary in 2017. Led by Brian G. Brosnan, Christopher M. Ursitti, Peter Brosnan and Ken Johnson, Hollywood Locations represents eighty percent of the most prestigious and filmable buildings in Los Angeles and its production clients include all the major motion picture, television, and commercial companies including Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros, Sony Pictures, HBO, 20th Century Fox, Disney ABC Television Group, AMC, Showtime, NBC and CBS.\n\nLos Angeles Center Studios is a twenty-acre campus just west of downtown Los Angeles with 450,000 square feet of Class-A and production turnkey office space, six 18,000 square foot state-of-the-art sound stages, a backlot with numerous practical locations, and a full range of services and on-site amenities. Los Angeles Center Studios is on course to become one of the largest independent motion picture studios in the world.

He has also designed and developed multi-million dollar homes for celebrities and other high net worth individuals. He is known for his creative and innovative use of “Green” building materials and techniques. His alma mater Westminster College (in Fulton, Mo) awarded him the prestigious Lifetime Alumni Achievement Award in 2011 for his leadership, innovative approach to business and a strong commitment to a “Greener” world for future generations.\n\nPeter D. Brosnan\n\nPete Brosnan – Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Hollywood Locations and Co-Owner and Managing Partner of Los Angeles Center Studios\n\nPete Brosnan is a licensed California Real Estate Broker specializing in the marketing and managing of commercial properties for use as film locations. As Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Hollywood Locations, Brosnan oversees multiple portfolios and all filming license agreements generated through the firm. The Los Angeles County MTA, Douglas Emmett and Brookfield Properties and are just a few of many major accounts that Brosnan has helped to acquire for the company.

Brosnan has a Bachelor’s Degree in Communications from California State University, Northridge. He also currently sits on the Downtown Regional Council for the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) of Greater Los Angeles and recently received the Chairman’s Award of Excellence for his work dedicated to the 100th Anniversary of the organization.\n\nKen R. Johnson\n\nKenneth R. Johnson – Senior Vice President Hollywood Locations and Co-Owner and Managing Partner of Los Angeles Center Studios\n\nIn the twenty-six years that Kenneth R. Johnson has been with The Hollywood Location Company (HLC) and later Los Angeles Center Studios (LACS), he has participated in and managed filming with both major real estate portfolios and at LACS. Joining the company with ten years of entertainment and film production experience at Universal Studios, he brought with him an understanding of the filmmaking process and applied it to the particular needs of HLC’s and LACS’s various clients.\n\nStarting as HLC’s first Site Coordinator in 1989, he was instrumental in establishing and fostering some of the company’s longest standing relationships. In 1993, he joined the office staff and began negotiating license agreements with the many producers wishing to film at HLC properties. In 1995, he became Vice President of Operations and conducted the majority of the negotiations with Major Studios and Independent Production Companies on behalf of HLC’s numerous clients. In 1997 Johnson was made a partner and shifted his focus to Sales and Marketing at LACS. Since that time he has had a hand in forming one of the best teams in the business at the finest independent production facility in Southern California.\n\nFollowing the negotiation and management of almost one thousand separate deals at a multitude of different properties, and over six thousand deals at LACS he has gained a reputation within both the film and property management communities as an astute negotiator and a knowledgeable and fair professional.\n\nCurrently as Co-owner and Managing Partner, he oversees the various operations and participates in the management of Los Angeles Center Studios. Johnson states, “It has been my great pleasure to work with the creative professionals in the Entertainment and Real Estate fields. I firmly believe in The Hollywood Location Company’s mission of providing first rate service at first rate properties.\n\nHollywood Locations (HLC) was founded in 1989 by Brian Brosnan who, after an impressive career as a Location Manager on films such as the Academy Award – winning Terms of Endearment and television shows such as Murder She Wrote, created the company to help stem the tide of productions moving away from downtown Los Angeles due to strict “no-filming” building policies and inadequate regulations. Hollywood Locations was originally based at the historic Herald Examiner building at 11th and Broadway after Mr. Brosnan successfully petitioned the Hearst Corporation into preserving the historical integrity of the building by using the site for location filming. With the experienced leadership of Mr. Brosnan and his partner Christopher Ursitti, Hollywood Locations expanded their service in 1992, when they acquired the ornate courtroom set used in the feature film, Body of Evidence, starring Madonna. In 1994, the significant revenue generated by the rental of the set inspired the partners to create the Playa Vista Sound Stages. What was once 50,000 square feet of cramped office space on the historic Hughes Aircraft property soon became a multipurpose production center. The Playa Vista Stages housed such major film projects as Batman Forever and Independence Day.\n\nThroughout the 1990’s, Hollywood Locations continued to pioneer innovative marketing techniques such as the HLC Network, a forerunner of the computerized image database that exists on the Internet today as www.hollywoodlocations.com. This type of forward thinking led to the creation of Hollywood Locations biggest venture in 1998, a full service motion picture studio on a 20-acre campus just west of downtown called Los Angeles Center Studios (LACS) that now comprises 450,000 square feet of “Class-A” and production office space, six state-of-the-art sound stages, a backlot with numerous practical locations, and a full range of services and on-site amenities. LACS is on course to become one of the largest independent motion picture studios in the world.\n\nSince its inception, HLC has grown to become the industry leader in film location management. Led by Brian G. Brosnan, Christopher M. Ursitti, Peter Brosnan and Ken Johnson, HLC represents 80% of the most prestigious and filmable buildings in Los Angeles that are sought after by all the major motion picture, television and commercial companies."
