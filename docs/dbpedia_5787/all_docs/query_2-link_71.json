        "meta_description": "Silent, edited footage of the free concert at Altamont Speedway on the afternoon and evening of Saturday, December 6, 1969. The film begins and ends with a shot of burning wood. The footage taken in the daytime features Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger appear as spectators during The Flying Burrito Brothers' set. The nighttime footage features the Rolling Stones. The footage is quite dark, with Mick Jagger most visible. Most of the footage is of the performers onstage. There are also long shots of the crowd and of individuals dancing and singing. In both the daytime and nighttime footage, there are shots of Hells Angels on stage with the performers, and some shots of them getting rough and pushing people off the stage.",
