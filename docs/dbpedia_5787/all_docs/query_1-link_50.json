The Bodleian Library’s Divinity School appears as the Hogwarts Infirmary, while Christ Church College’s Great Hall was the inspiration for Hogwarts’ dining hall (with studio sets built to mirror it).

Here, you can find the remnants of historical epics and fantastical worlds, creating an enchanting blend of reality and imagination.\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nThe following locations in Croatia offered “Game of Thrones” an array of settings that could convincingly depict the series’ fictional lands, contributing significantly to the show’s visual appeal and atmospheric depth. The popularity of “Game of Thrones” has since turned these Croatian sites into major tourist attractions, drawing fans from around the world eager to walk in the footsteps of their favorite characters.\n\nThere are a TON of options when it comes to filming locations for GOT in Croatia, but here are a few you shouldn’t miss!\n\nDubrovnik: The most iconic Croatian location in GOT is Dubrovnik, which served as the primary filming location for King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, from season two onwards.

Key locations within Dubrovnik include the Lovrijenac Fortress (the Red Keep), the Stradun (the main street through King’s Landing), and the Dubrovnik City Walls, which were used for numerous scenes, including the Battle of the Blackwater and Cersei’s Walk of Shame.\n\nSplit: This city, known for its ancient palace of Roman Emperor Diocletian, was used to film various scenes, including those set in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep and in the city of Meereen. The cellars of Diocletian’s Palace were a key location, especially for scenes involving Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons.\n\nKlis Fortress: Overlooking the city of Split, Klis Fortress was used to represent the city of Meereen. The fortress provided the backdrop for Daenerys’ crucifixion scene of the Meereenese nobles and other exterior shots of the city.\n\nŠibenik: The historic city of Šibenik stood in for Braavos, one of the Free Cities across the Narrow Sea. Key locations in Šibenik include St. James Cathedral, which was used for the Iron Bank scenes, and the fortresses of St. Michael and St. John, which provided additional backdrops for the city.\n\nTrsteno Arboretum: Located just north of Dubrovnik, this lush botanical garden was used as the setting for the Red Keep’s gardens.

The city is famous for its Sassi, a complex of cave dwellings carved into the limestone, which date back over 7,000 years, making Matera one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. This unique historical and cultural significance led to the Sassi of Matera being designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.\n\nThe city’s rugged beauty, narrow streets, and ancient architecture have made it a popular location for filmmakers seeking a visually arresting backdrop. Check out some of the top films shot in this part of Italy.\n\nJames Bond film “No Time to Die” (2021): Matera gained particular international attention when it was chosen as one of the filming locations for the 2021 Bond film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and starring Daniel Craig in his final appearance as the iconic British spy.\n\n“The Passion of the Christ” (2004): Directed by Mel Gibson, this film used Matera’s ancient landscapes to represent Jerusalem and its surroundings during the time of Jesus Christ. The stark, rugged terrain and the old, stone structures of the city provided a convincing setting for this biblical story.\n\n“Wonder Woman” (2017): Although primarily set during World War I, “Wonder Woman” used Matera to film several scenes set in the fictional Amazonian island of Themyscira. The city’s natural beauty and historic structures contributed to the mythical and ancient look of the Amazon’s homeland.\n\n“Mary Magdalene” (2018): This biblical drama, which tells the story of Mary Magdalene, filmed extensively in Matera.

Its winding streets and picturesque squares have made it an attractive location for filmmakers looking for authentic Italian scenery.\n\nAside from its appearance in the Twilight saga, Montepulciano has been a backdrop for various Italian and international movies and TV shows, thanks to its quintessential Tuscan appearance.\n\nLake Como area and Star Wars\n\nWhile there is still (and always will be) a lot of contention surrounding the various prequel movies in the Star Wars legacy, the filming locations are neutral ground. Many of those locations took place on site, which may surprise many as most think this series was shot solely on a green screen. Here are a few of the main filming locations in Italy.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Caserta: The Royal Palace of Caserta, with its majestic interiors and expansive gardens, was used as a stand-in for the royal palace of Naboo in the prequel trilogy, notably appearing in “Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace” and “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.”\n\nLake Como: This idyllic location provided the scenic backdrop for the secret wedding of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala in “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” specifically at the Villa del Balbianello.\n\nEtna: Mount Etna’s erupting lava flows were filmed and used as the fiery landscapes of the planet Mustafar in “Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith,” where the climactic duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker takes place.\n\nScotland filming locations\n\nFrom ancient castles to untamed landscapes, Scotland’s movie locations offer a mesmerizing blend of fantasy and reality.

Located on an island at the point where three great sea lochs meet, and surrounded by some majestic scenery, it is little wonder that the castle is now one of the most visited and important attractions in the Scottish Highlands. The castle’s history dates back to the early 13th century, with the original fortress being built around 1220 by Alexander II as a defense against the Vikings. Over the centuries, it has been rebuilt and restored several times, with the present buildings largely the result of 20th-century reconstruction.\n\nEilean Donan has been featured in several movies, including:\n\n“Highlander” (1986): Perhaps the most famous film to feature Eilean Donan, it serves as the home of the film’s protagonist, Connor MacLeod.\n\n“The World Is Not Enough” (1999): This James Bond film used the castle as the exterior of the MI6 temporary headquarters in Scotland.\n\n“Made of Honor” (2008): Eilean Donan appeared in this romantic comedy starring Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan.\n\nGlenfinnan Viaduct\n\nGlenfinnan Viaduct is a spectacular railway viaduct located in the West Highlands of Scotland, near the town of Glenfinnan.

The viaduct spans 380 meters (1,247 feet) across the Glenfinnan valley and features 21 arches, reaching a maximum height of 30 meters (100 feet) over the ground.

The viaduct and its surroundings were used to depict the iconic journey of the Hogwarts Express, especially memorable in scenes where the train travels across the viaduct on its way to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its appearances in the Harry Potter films, particularly “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” have turned the viaduct into a pilgrimage site for fans of the series, eager to see the real-life location of Harry’s magical train rides.\n\nDoune Castle\n\nDoune Castle is a medieval stronghold near the village of Doune, in the Stirling district of central Scotland. The castle was originally built in the 13th century, then rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany.

The castle’s authentic historical feel made it an ideal choice for the time-travel series, which blends historical fiction with romance and fantasy.\n\n“Game of Thrones” (2011 – 2019): In the pilot episode of this HBO series based on the books by George R.R. Martin, Doune Castle was used as a stand-in for Winterfell, the ancestral home of the Stark family. Although the series later used other locations for Winterfell, Doune Castle’s appearance in the pilot helped set the tone for the show’s epic scope and intricate production design.\n\nGlencoe\n\nGlencoe is one of Scotland’s most famous and scenic glens, often celebrated for its dramatic landscapes, towering mountains, and deep valleys.
