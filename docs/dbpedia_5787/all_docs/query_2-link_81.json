        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nThe sequel to the 1986 classic that featured breathtaking fighter jet sequences and launched the career of Tom Cruise has landed more than three decades after Maverick felt the need for speed.\n\nLike its predecessor, Top Gun: Maverick was filmed primarily in San Diego, California, but also in Nevada and Washington State.\n\nSet 36 years after the events of the first installment, in this new film Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell returns to the Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program to lead a new generation of pilots on a near-suicide mission.\n\nWelcome to our spoiler-free guide to all the filming locations of Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nYou can also find our wonderful article revealing all the locations where Top Gun was filmed following this link.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick Locations\n\nThe opening and final scenes in the Mojave Desert hangar with the silver P-51 Mustang, which also appears in the video with Lady Gaga, were filmed at the Inyokern Airport in California.\n\nThis World War II veteran is actually Cruise's own airplane who is also a licensed pilot in the real world.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount Pictures - Map\n\nThe sequence with the experimental (and fictional) Darkstar plane, was filmed at the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in the Mojave Desert.\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski said that in the scene with Ed Harris pictured, the plane destroyed the set, ripping the roof off the guard shack.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Map\n\nThe Cecil's Cafe scene following the supersonic jet crash was filmed at the Halfway House cafe located on the outskirts of Santa Clarita.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount Pictures - Map\n\nThe Top Gun Station\n\nThe Top Gun base, nicknamed \"Fightertown USA\", was filmed at several locations, including the North Island Naval Air Station on San Diego Bay.\n\nThe plane on display outside the main gate is actually an A-4E Skyhawk, not the F-14 Tomcat that the filmmakers CGI'd into the scene.\n\nImage courtesy of Skydance Media - Map\n\nThe Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada and the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Oak Harbor, Washington, were also featured in the new film.\n\nIn the 1986 movie, most of the Top Gun school was filmed at the Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, now the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (MCAS Miramar), at the time known as \"Fightertown USA\".\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Maps: Fallon / Whidbey Island\n\nThe Top Gun beach and the Hard Deck bar\n\nAs the local press reported, the Hard Deck bar owned by Penelope \"Penny\" Benjamin (played by Jennifer Connelly) was located on Breaker’s Beach in Coronado.\n\nIn 2018, the film crew built an impressive set in less than a month on this beach, located at the Coronado air station premises.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Map\n\nLooking at the background scenery, it seems that the sailing scene was filmed in San Francisco Bay.\n\nImage courtesy of Skydance Media - Map\n\nPenny's house is a gorgeous oceanfront home located at 4000 Bluff Place in San Pedro near Cabrillo Beach.\n\nThis is a private residence - if you are visiting, please be considerate of the owners’ property.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount and Google Maps\n\nIn one of the first training scenes, the F-18s fly over Groves Lake in Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Nevada.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Map\n\nAs the San Diego Union-Tribune revealed, the funeral scene was filmed at the Army's Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point Loma.\n\nThis beautiful burial ground, with perfectly lined-up gravestones overlooking San Diego Harbor and the Pacific Ocean, is the resting place for service members since the Battle of San Pasqual during the Mexican-American War in 1846.\n\nAt least 112,000 Army, Navy Seals, Sailors, Marines, and Air Force are buried at Fort Rosecrans.\n\nImage courtesy of Skydance Media - Map\n\nAmateur photographer Christopher Lohff captured a picture of a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet pilot wearing Maverick's helmet flying over the Rainbow Canyon, also known as Star Wars Canyon, in the Death Valley National Park.\n\nPopular among military pilots for training missions, the canyon earned its nickname due to its resemblance to scenes from the Star Wars films, offering stunning views of low-flying fighter jets maneuvering through its colorful rock formations.\n\nThe photo also reveals an array of four devices resembling the new Sony VENICE CineAlta video cameras positioned on the coaming of the rear cockpit.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Map\n\nThe F-18 low-level flyover scene and the target range were filmed at the US Naval Reservation and training area in Nevada.\n\nThis military zone is situated about 37 miles southeast of NAS Fallon.\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount - Map\n\nThe aircraft carrier scenes were filmed on board the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe actors went through a three-month rigorous aviation training course to prepare for riding in an F-18, as the producers tried to use as much real aircraft footage as possible instead of green screens and CGI.\n\nWhen the Dagger squadron arrives at the entrance of the canyon, leading to the uranium enrichment plant, they fly over the Big Creek Bridge on the Big Sur coast of California.\n\nImage courtesy of Skydance Media -

My uncle was an E-8 in the Navy in the '70s and we used to go to that very spot and swim.\n\nThere was nobody around and we would have the entire place to ourselves on any given Sunday. Seeing the Bar and the Volley Ball game where the old building used to be was humbling. If only we had known...\n\n12- Bob - Jun 15, 2022, 5:10 PM\n\nFort Rosecrans National Cemetery is the burial place for all services, not just the Army.\n\n13- Anonymous - Jun 15, 2022, 11:26 PM\n\nAny idea where the offshore sailing scene was filmed?

Since there are mountains in the background it can’t be the actual Cecil's cafe in Marshalltown, Iowa.\n\n19- Anonymous - Jul 16, 2022, 5:20 PM\n\nImmediately following Maverick’s mishap in the experimental scramjet he is shown walking towards a diner with a mountain in the distance.

In the Mojave Desert, which is full of aviators and test pilots, and listening to the giggles of all the locals. It was pretty true to reality, though...\n\nLots of Navy guys (aviators) are out there in the desert, and many of them use the smaller private hangars in nearby Inyokern (the one in the movie) as well as in Mojave and Rosamond and Lancaster.\n\n22- Roger - Aug 16, 2022, 2:20 PM\n\nI believe at least parts of the diner scene following the supersonic jet crash were filmed at the Halfway House Cafe in Santa Clarita.\n\n23- Mark - Kent, UK - Aug 16, 2022, 4:56 PM\n\nI am desperate to find out who can supply the table cloth in the 'Hard Deck Bar' scenes...

I recognized the background scenery immediately when I saw it the first time. I spent most of my life living there, I know that scenery well.\n\n26- Anonymous - Sep 16, 2022, 8:31 PM\n\nAlthough the exterior scene of Maverick walking toward \"Cecil's Cafe\" does appear to use the facade of the Halfway House, as mentioned above, the surrounding scenery is edited/photoshopped in from somewhere else, probably to infer that he is up in the Northwest somewhere. There are certainly no big pines trees or log trucks anywhere near Santa Clarita or Acton.\n\n27- Anonymous - Sep 20, 2022, 6:19 PM\n\nHaving lived in San Diego when hubby was stationed on Submariners at Pt Loma, I recognized so much of the area having driven many of the streets, bases, etc in the area. Really a great movie and still is!\n\n28- 5 min and a hunch - Nov 11, 2022, 5:48 PM\n\nThe bridge scene when entering enemy territory is the Big Creek Bridge (a cousin to Bixby, also in Big Sur).\n\n29- Anonymous - Dec 14, 2022, 11:36 AM\n\nPerhaps Top Gun helped USAF recruitment, as well, but I've always heard that it was a great recruitment tool for the US Navy, which was why they helped make this movie. The USAF has fighters, too, of course, but they had nothing to do with this movie, which is all about the US Navy and its independent air force.\n\n30- Anonymous - Dec 25, 2022, 7:52 PM\n\nGreat work, thank you for filling in the blanks!\n\n31- Anonymous - Jan 14, 2023, 3:35 PM\n\nThe P-51 flying scenes at the end of the film started at the Inyokern Airport just as the very beginning did. They then shot the flying scenes just west of the airport above Mt. Owens and further north a bit, which is the southern end of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.\n\nIf you’ve seen a car commercial with car on a road with mountains in the background in the last 30 years, it was filmed on a runway at the Inyokern Airport with Mt. Owens in the background, or the later specially constructed private runway used just for car commercials.\n\n32- Anonymous - Apr 2, 2023, 1:52 PM\n\nAs an ex-military MP, I’m obsessed with the SR-71 and now the SR-72 Darkstar. But some of the info was wrong, when the Darkstar hit Mack 10 and Hondo stated he was the fastest man on earth.\n\nMajor Brain Shul would contradict you on that cause he is the fastest man on earth at Mack 10-13 off the record. From Beal AFB, CA to New York in 1 3/4 hours you do the math. Cruse’s P-51 Mustang is one from the Tuskegee Airmen from the 332nd Air Group or the 99th.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen’s planes are the only ones that have Red Noses and Tails. No other Airgroup or their planes have a Red Nise and Tail. Cruse’s plane is unique. If you were ever to show up at Minden, Airport and I found out about it, I would definitely like a ride in it with Tom at the controls.\n\n33- Jeff - Apr 2, 2023, 1:52 PM\n\nThis tweaked my curiosity, so I watched Maverick’s Test Run scene and looked at the target range on Google maps to see if anything looked familiar. It looks like the low-speed pass over the salt flat and the high G climb into and out of the simulated crater occurred at that target range near Fallon. The exact GPS coordinates where Maverick hit the bullseye appear to be 39°14'13.8\"N 118°15'43.3\"W.\n\nThus, “The F-18 low-level flyover scene seems to have been filmed at the Utah Test and Training Range salt flats located in Utah's West Desert” seems to be incorrect!\n\nCheck out the satellite image at those coordinates and carefully look at the images of the target in the movie scene and let me know if you agree!\n\nReply\n\n34- Ra Moon - Apr 3, 2023, 3:42 PM\n\nThank you Jeff, you are right, updated!\n\n35- Jeff - Jun 6, 2023, 9:33 PM\n\nI think this is the Bixby Bridge in Big Sur.\n\n36- Bill F - Jun 9, 2023, 12:25 PM\n\nRecruiting tool for the AirForce?

Coronado is its own town, just across the bay from San Diego. I was actually living there when Top Gun: Maverick was filmed.\n\n38- Anonymous - Aug 19, 2023, 2:42 PM\n\nThe target run to the final bomb site is filmed over Lake Kachess (not Rimrock), up the Mineral Creek drainage, and the climb into the inverted dive is up an avalanche chute between Lemah Mountain and Chimney Rock.\n\nI’ve watched F-18s and previously A-6 Intruders do this same run out of Whidbey NAS for over 25 years from my place at Cooper Lake just east of that location. It was plain as day in the movie to me.\n\nJust two weeks ago, I watched an F-18 go inverted in the same exact same spot. Now the guys get to show off a bit. :)\n\n39- Anonymous - Jan 2, 2024, 1:19 PM\n\nJust a fun fact. Penny Benjamin's house was previously used in TV-series JAG. In season 2, episode 3, \"Jinx,\" the house is portrayed as the house of guest character Annie.\n\nAlthough the two were filmed 25-ish years apart, there are no doubts. The hedge has changed, but the house and even the number on the door (no. 391) are the exact same.\n\n40- Anonymous - Feb 28, 2024, 6:36 PM\n\nIn the 70's, I worked in Death Valley and watched practice dogfights in Rose Canyon. It may have been F-18s chasing something that looked like a MIG. On another day, the planes were supersonic and rattled all the buildings in the canyon.\n\nOn another day, we were working at the intersection of Hwy 180 and Rose Canyon Road, and a pilot flew up the road, turned around, and flew past us at 100 feet. He then turned east on 180 and headed towards Stovepipe Wells.\n\nI heard somewhere that pilots would head into Death Valley and have their altimeters go negative. All this was kinda against the rules in a National Park, but it was cooler than sh*t.\n\n41- Anonymous - Mar 21, 2024, 3:09 PM\n\nDuring the training runs, they pass over Groves Lake in Toiyabe canyon, coordinates 39.241433706000514, -117.16521562087846\n\n42- Anonymous - Jun 27, 2024, 8:27 PM\n\nThe ending scene with the TF-51 flying was actually filmed near the KIYK field near the High Sierra foothill range, not in Washington, as previously mentioned.\n\nRa Moon\n\nAtlas of Wonders is looking for wonderful Filming Locations all around the world.
