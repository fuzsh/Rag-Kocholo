        "text": "While the California film industry is based in Los Angeles, over the years many films have shot in Northern California, looking for rural towns, forests, rivers and beaches that can double for New England and even Scotland. Hollywood has been filming in California's northern most 18 counties since at least 1916 and the region has played host to some of Hollywood's biggest films, including The Adventures of Robin Hood, Gone with the Wind, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, and Stand by Me.[1][2][3][4]\n\nThis list of films shot is organized first by county, and then chronologically by year. Some films may appear more than once if they were shot in more than one county.\n\nDel Norte County\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Location(s) Ref.
