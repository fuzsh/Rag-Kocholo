        "text": "Inception is a heady sci-fi concept. It is grounded by a clear heist plot and character-driven complications and ranks among the best films of the 2010s.\n\nIn this blog, weâre going to break down Nolanâs masterpiece using the Save the Cat formula and then consider what lessons we can apply to our writing.\n\nLetâs dive into it.Â\n\nFree Inception screenplay\n\nBe sure to follow along with this breakdown with our free PDF script of Inception. Download it here.\n\nNolanâs first big original hit\n\nInception was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Marion Cotillard. It was released in 2010.\n\nNolan had brought the film to Warner Bros. as early as 2002 while working on another film, Insomnia. It took many more years to get the project to fruition, with Nolan directing Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in the intervening years.Â\n\nSince The Prestige was based on a novel, and Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were based on Batman IP, Inception was Nolanâs first original film since 2000âs Memento. (Sort of. That film was based on his brother Jonathanâs short story Memento Mori.)\n\nProving that original ideas had box office draw (at least when he was directing) Nolanâs Inception paved the way for his future original work in sci-fi and action work with Interstellar and Tenet.\n\nLetâs now dive into the main characters.\n\nMain Characters\n\nDom CobbÂ\n\nDom Cobb is the leader and main protagonist in the film.\n\nCobb is a skilled extractor who can enter people's dreams. He is hired by Saito to carry out an inception operation on Robert Fischer, heir to a company that Saito wants to take over in order to expand his business empire.\n\nInception follows Cobb as he attempts this complex task.\n\nArthurÂ\n\nArthur is a reliable and smooth operator, who takes pride in his work.\n\nHe is the only person who knows about Cobb's wife, Mal, and it was his job to tell Cobb that she had left him. He also knows how to get back to reality from the dream world.\n\nArthur is portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nAriadneÂ\n\nAriadne is an architecture student, who is roped into becoming a mastermind in the inception operation.Â She helps Cobb find his children and Mal in his dreams, but also guides him out of limbo at the end of the movie. She is portrayed by Elliot Page.Â\n\nEamesÂ\n\nEames is a forger who can impersonate anybody. Heâs played by British actor Tom Hardy, and his character was originally written as a woman. In the course of the film Eames transforms into a woman.Â\n\nSaitoÂ\n\nSaito is the mysterious Japanese mogul that hires Cobb's team to carry out inception on rival Robert Fischer. He is a powerful and wealthy man. Saito is portrayed by Ken Watanabe\n\nMalÂ\n\nMal was Cobb's wife who committed suicide and comes back to haunt him emotionally. She was a projection of Cobb's subconscious, a character in the dream world, a manifestation of Cobb's guilt and his grief and regret.\n\nCobb is haunted by Mal because she represents one of his greatest regrets: moving on after her death too quickly. He has been carrying around this guilt for years now, blaming himself for what happened to her.\n\nShe is portrayed by Shannon Welles and Marion Cotillard.\n\nInception Breakdown Using Save the Cat\n\nSave The Cat has been a relatively controversial book.Â Proponents see it as a simplification of the complexities of a screen story and opponents see it as a reduction of those very same complexities.\n\nRegardless, the Save The Cat beat sheet has become a touchstone for amateur and pro writers alike.\n\nNow that you have some context, letâs dive into this film.\n\nOpening Image\n\nCobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) wakes in the surf on a beach. He looks up and sees two children running in the sand. He calls them, but they donât turn.\n\nTheme Stated\n\nCobb says to Saito (Ken Watanabe) âOnce an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there.â\n\nSet-Up\n\nSaito uncovers that Cobb and his partner Arthur are attempting to âextractâ secrets from him through dream-sharing technology.Â\n\nThe audience comes to understand how dreams work, and how they can nest within each other.\n\nCatalyst\n\nThough unsuccessful in their attempt, Saito is impressed by Cobb and his team and offers another job: Inception.\n\nHe wants them to plant an idea in the mind of the heir of the company of his rival.\n\nDebate\n\nCobb and Arthur are intrigued. Inception is notoriously tricky, but Saito sweetens the deal by promising that if done Cobb can return home to his family.\n\nCobb agrees to do it.\n\nBreak into two\n\nÂ Cobb meets Miles (Michael Caine) to recruit a new âarchitectâ before assembling the rest of the team.\n\nB story\n\nCobb is introduced to Ariadne (Elliot Page, then credited as Ellen Page) who will become not only the audienceâs surrogate with the rules of the dream world but to Cobbâs backstory as well.\n\nFun & games\n\nAriadneâS training includes manipulating architecture in cities and building out dream worlds.\n\nShe receives her âtotemâ , an object which will help a dreamer understand if theyâre dreaming or not.\n\nShe also encounters and learns of Mal (Marion Cotillard) Cobbâs wife, who passed away but is still present in his dreams. Additionally, the team is assembled. Cobb recruits Eames (Tom Hardy) who will impersonate people in the targetâs life. They learn more about their target, Fischer (Cillian Murphy), and begin to concoct the plan for inception.\n\nWith everything ready, the team has orchestrated a flight in which they have access to the target until the plane lands. They begin and all start dreaming.\n\nMidpoint\n\nThe team enters the first (of three) dream worlds and realizes that Fischer has been prepared for such an event as theyâre attempting. This will be more difficult than they realized.\n\nBad guys close in\n\nEamesâ plan to impersonate a confidant of Fischer fails. The team must go to the next level of dream worlds. They are administered in a van that is being chased. Additionally, Saito has been shot.\n\nIn Level 2, to incept Fischer, Cobb must convince him to go into another dream. As they enter Level 3, Arthur must watch over them all in the hotel in Level 2, which has lost gravity, as in Level 1, the van is in free fall.\n\nIn Level 3, the remaining members of the team attempt to incept Fischer but are chased among ski slopes by his subconscious. Additionally, Mal continues to stalk Cobbâs dreams.\n\nAll is lost\n\nEnemies surrounding the team struggle to reach Fischer. Mal gets there first and shoots him.\n\nDark night of the soul\n\nSaito is dying, and will be lost in limbo (unconstructed dream space). Fischer, their target has been shot and will also be lost in limbo.\n\nBreak into three\n\nAriadne convinces Cobb to travel one level deeper, to limbo, to find Saito and save Fischer. But doing so will mean that Cobb must finally confront Mal.\n\nFinale\n\nThey travel into limbo and find Fischer, he is being held by Mal. Cobb confronts her and tells her that she is not his wife, she is a projection.\n\nTheyâre able to save Fischer, and send him back to Level 3, where Eames helps complete inception.\n\nThe team begins to wake, but Cobb remains behind to find Saito in limbo. He does and saves him.\n\nFinal image\n\nCobb returns home to see his children (the same children from the opening at the beach). As he runs to them, the camera lingers on his totem, a spinning top. Is Cobb dreaming?\n\nKey insights\n\nOne of the things that struck me while reviewing the screenplay of Inception was that for all the mind-bendiness of the script, it has an incredibly straightforward plot. The central aim of the plot is to âput this idea in this guyâs head.â It functions as a sort of reverse heist. Its simplicity is what allows space for all the various dream concepts explored throughout.\n\nThe script for this film is 147 pages long, and the team gets on the plan on page 71 to begin the job. Thatâs nearly exactly halfway through, and so the entire back half of the film is the job.\n\nItâs a great example of the midpoint beat because itâs not a significant âturnâ or âreversalâ like we might expect at the Break Into Two or Break Into Three, but it is a significant point-of-no-return for the protagonist.\n\nWhile it has a lot of exposition to dole out, both in concept and in character,Â Inceptionâs script is relatively restrained in its exposition dumps. Iâd go so far as to say there aren't any large exposition dumps at all.Â\n\nInstead, the film keeps stringing together many small independent scenes, each with a tiny piece of information that will be built upon later. The average scene size (in terms of page count) in Inception is much smaller than in most films. This is particularly true in the first half of the screenplay, where most scenes are only one or two pages.\n\nBig idea, simple story\n\nInception is a masterclass in keeping your story simple. At no point during this script do you wonder, âwhy are they doing that?â in terms of plot or purpose. Thereâs always clarity in what the team is doing.\n\nWhen this film came out, nobody complained about being spoon-fed information. Because they were too busy being mind-blown by the way these concepts unfolded on screen.\n\nIf youâve got some big ideas in the first draft of your screenplay, is your story simple enough to support them?\n\nâ\n\nIf youâre plotting your first script today then be sure to consider downloading Arc Studio which is full of great tools to get you all the way from your first idea to landing that green light from the studio of your dreams.Â\n\nHappy writing!"
