        "text": "We can’t believe that Under the Tuscan Sun is already 20 years old.\n\nThis drama set in dreamy Italy inspired countless travelers to book weeks-long trips through Tuscany—and we’re willing to bet that after a few bottles of Chianti, a few of these vacationers were convinced to buy their own Tuscan villa fixer-upper.\n\nWe’re not here to tell you how to manage your real estate portfolio, but if you need a train to Tuscany, we’ve got you covered. Read while you ride to these Under the Tuscan Sun filming locations in Italy.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Merrill Images. Image Location: Piazza della Repubblica, Cortona, Tuscany, Italy\n\nFilm facts: Under the Tuscan Sun\n\nWhat is Under the Tuscan Sun about?\n\nIn this 2003 romantic-comedy hit, Diane Lane starred and nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for her role as Frances Mayes, a writer who discovers her husband is having an affair. Her depressing divorce convinces her to take an Italian vacation where she buys a rundown Tuscan villa.\n\nIs Under the Tuscan Sun a true story?\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun is based on the best-selling memoir of the same name, though the film is mostly fiction. In reality, Frances Mayes and her husband live happily ever after, with no affair, and renovate an abandoned Tuscan villa together.\n\nWhere was Under the Tuscan Sun filmed?\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun was filmed in Italy, because—let’s be real—there’s no substitute for such an amazing country. The filming locations for Under the Tuscan Sun read like the best Italian itinerary we can think of: Rome, Cortona, Florence, and Positano.\n\nWhat is the village in Under the Tuscan Sun?\n\nCortona is the village used for filming in Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane’s Under the Tuscan Sun character is inspired by author Frances Mayes who renovated a villa in Cortona with her husband (who did not have an affair, for the record).\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Chapin31. Image Location: Villa Bramasole, Cortona, Tuscany, Italy\n\nWhere is the house from Under the Tuscan Sun?\n\nVilla Bramasole, the house from Under the Tuscan Sun, is in Cortona. There are actually two Villa Bramasoles in Cortona. The first is the villa the Frances Mayes actually owned, but since that Bramasole was already renovated, the crew chose a different fixer-upper in the Tuscan countryside. The Villa Bramasole house used for filming Under the Tuscan Sun is known as Villa Laura.\n\nWhere was the beach scene in Under the Tuscan Sun filmed?\n\nThe beach scene in Under the Tuscan Sun wasn’t filmed under a Tuscan sun. It was filmed on the Amalfi Coast in the town of Positano. Though Tuscany isn’t quite as well known for its beaches, we recommend taking an hour-long train ride to see its stunning coast.\n\nWhere in Positano did they film Under the Tuscan Sun?\n\nPositano Beach was where they filmed the beach scene in Under the Tuscan Sun. Positano is located on the Amalfi Coast, east of Naples and roughly 5 hours from Florence. Hop on the high-speed train from Florence to Naples, then hit the beaches after a regional train or bus transfer.\n\nSee also: the best things to do in Positano and the Amalfi Coast\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Andrea Comi. Image Location: Positano, Amalfi Coast, Campania, Italy\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun filming locations\n\nFinding the Under the Tuscan Sun filming locations in Italy is the farthest thing from a chore. Give the movie a rewatch and plan a trip to the Italian cities where Under the Tuscan Sun was filmed.\n\nCortona\n\nNearest train station: Camucia Cortona\n\nThe bulk of the film takes place in Cortona, a small village south of Arezzo. That’s where you’ll find both Villa Bramasole houses, as well as the Piazza Signorelli (which sadly does not actually feature the film’s fountain). The market scene was shot at Piazza della Repubblica.\n\nMontepulciano/San Biagio\n\nIn southern Tuscany, you’ll find filming locations for a pair of celebratory scenes in Under the Tuscan Sun. The first: the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Biagio, in San Biagio. The wedding in the film’s finale features this gorgeous church. Piazza Grande in nearby Montepulciano also makes an appearing, though it pretends to be another part of Cortona.\n\nRead more: the 10 most beautiful towns and villages in Tuscany\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, jenifoto. Image Location: Montepulciano and Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Biagio (right), Tuscany, Italy\n\nPositano\n\nNearest train station: Vietri sul Mare-Amalfi\n\nThe Amalfi Coast is always worthy of a visit, but don’t expect to spend much time there checking out Under the Tuscan Sun filming locations. Only Positano Beach and Hotel California Positano are prominently featured.\n\nSee also: the best hotels in Positano and the Amalfi Coast\n\nRome\n\nNearest train station: Roma Termini\n\nWe won’t fault any filmmaker for squeezing a shot of Rome into any movie set in Italy. In Under the Tuscan Sun, we catch a glimpse of Piazza di San Simone and Piazza Venezia. If you look hard enough (and by that we mean at Cinecittà Studios), you’ll see the soundstage where they recorded many interior shots, including the San Francisco scenes.\n\nRead more: how to take a day trip from Rome to Tuscany\n\nA lot of Tuscan fun\n\nTrust us, Tuscany looks even more amazing in person than it does on the silver screen. Watch these movies set in Italy, then download the Trainline app and plan your vacation in Tuscany.\n\nWhile you're there, visit these Letters to Juliet filming locations in Tuscany. And if you're thinking of basing yourself in Florence, Tuscany's capital, why not consider these fantastic day trips from Florence by train?"
