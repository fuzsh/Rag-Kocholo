        "text": "Transformers: Bumblebee (2018)\n\nAt Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park\n\nWho knew giant robots could be so kind! The year is 1987. While on the run, Bumblebee the Autobot seeks refuge in a small Californian beach town junkyard. Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) discovers the giant robot, and their adventures lead to a budding friendship and a shared mission to save the world.\n\nThis action-packed science fiction reboot of the Transformers Franchise features scenes throughout Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, located in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Famous for the 40-acre grove of towering old-growth redwood trees, check out the largest tree at the park that’s approximately 277 feet tall and about 1,500 years old!\n\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\n\nAt Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park\n\nIf the dinosaurs from the first Jurassic Park didn't scare you enough, wait until you see the sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). After the destruction of the first Jurassic Park, Dr. John Alfred Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his engineers explore Jurassic Park's second site. However, things go south when the dinosaurs go wild, and everyone is forced to run for their lives.\n\nFilmed at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in the incredible Fern Canyon, this remarkable place was carved over the eons by a modest stream into a 50 to 80-foot-deep canyon sprouted with delicate ferns and other moisture-loving plants. It is also where we see antagonist Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare) attacked by a pack of hungry Compsognathus–ultimately leading to his demise. Yikes!\n\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)\n\nAt Will Rogers State Historic Park\n\nWhat could be more terrifying than an alien attack? How about humpback whales going extinct?! Earth is under attack by an alien probe that has disabled global power and evaporated the oceans. Captain Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and the rest of the crew must travel back in time to 1986 San Francisco and retrieve the only beings who can communicate with it – the now-extinct humpback whales.\n\nFilming the stolen 'Bird of Prey' ship landing scene in Golden Gate Park occurred at the polo field at Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades. Once a ranch owned by famed Hollywood actor Will Rogers (1879–1935), the property was donated by his wife Betty to California State Parks in 1944 to become a state historic park after his untimely death in a plane crash.\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nAt Sonoma Coast State Park\n\nHow far would you go to protect your home from a development company? In the classic movie The Goonies (1985), we meet an adventurous band of kids who takes on the pressure of a property developing company that plans to foreclose their homes to build a country club. When the children discover an old pirate map in the attic, they follow it into an underground cavern in search of lost treasure – but come up against plenty of dangerous traps along the way.\n\nIn the movie's final scene, the children are reunited with their families at Cauldron Point after a series of dangerous adventures that caused the pirate ship \"Inferno\" to sail adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Filmed at Goat Rock Beach at Sonoma Coast State Park, Goat Rock sits next to the mouth of the Russian River and is known for its scenic shoreline and easily accessible sandy beach. The beach is also home to a colony of harbor seals, but be sure to stay 50 yards away from them.\n\nStar Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nAt Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park\n\nIn this now classic \"Speeder Chase\" scene from Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), we see protagonists Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) pilot a pair of Imperial speeders to chase down scout troopers who might reveal the Rebel Alliance's presence on Endor.\n\nThis unforgettable chase features Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park, a small but mighty—less than one square mile park with only five miles of trails features some of the finest old-growth redwood groves in the area. Established in 1943, many Star Wars fans still make pilgrimages to this grove! The movie also films in other Northern California state park locations such as Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and Sue-Meg State Park.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nAt Point Dume State Beach\n\nWhat would you do if you were one of the last few humans remaining on Earth? The devastating ending to Planet of the Apes (1968) sent shockwaves through moviegoers. In this ending scene, Astronaut George Taylor (Charlton Heston) discovers that he had been on a distant future Earth the entire time when he came across the destroyed statue of Liberty – and gives us the iconic line, “You finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew it up!”\n\nWhile several movie scenes were filmed in Malibu Creek State Park, this classic final moment took place at Point Dume State Beach. Known for its incredible view of Santa Monica Bay, parts of Malibu Coast, Santa Monica Mountains, and distant Catalina Island on a clear day – it's no surprise this beach would become the final resting place of Lady Liberty."
