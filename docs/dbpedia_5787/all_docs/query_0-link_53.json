        "text": "San Francisco is an iconic city in northern California, and it has been featured as the backdrop of many films and TV shows. Check out some of the locations throughout the city that have been used as filming locations:\n\nGolden Gate Bridge\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is one of San Francisco’s most recognizable landmarks, and it has been featured on the screen many times. In “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” a massive battle breaks out on the bridge.\n\nIn action movies, the Golden Gate Bridge is often destroyed, such as “Star Trek Into Darkness,” “Godzilla,” “Pacific Rim,” and “San Andreas.”\n\nCity Hall\n\nSan Francisco’s City Hall is a beautiful structure, showcasing unique architectural elements and colors.\n\nIt serves as the backdrop for scenes in “Dirty Harry” and the four subsequent films in the franchise.\n\nIn “The Wedding Planner,” two characters visit City Hall to get married.\n\nIt was also featured in “Milk” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”\n\nThe Painted Ladies\n\nThe Painted Ladies are a set of Victorian and Edwardian rowhouses across from Alamo Square Park.\n\nThey have been featured in a number of films and TV shows. The townhomes are best known for representing the residence of the Tanner family in “Full House” and its spinoff, “Fuller House.”\n\nAlcatraz\n\nAlcatraz is a prison that has housed notorious criminals, including Al Capone.\n\nIt has also inspired a number of films.\n\nTwo major films include “Escape from Alcatraz” and “The Rock.”\n\nThe island is visible from much of the city.\n\n2640 Steiner Street\n\nBuilt in 1893, the house at 2640 Steiner Street in San Francisco was the home featured in “Mrs. Doubtfire.”\n\nNew exterior features have altered its appearance since the movie was filmed.\n\nAlamo Square Park\n\nThe playground at Alamo Square Park is the setting for the scene in “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” when alien life forms begin budding on the nearby plants.\n\nAshbury Street House\n\nThe Disney Channel’s “That’s So Raven” featured the Ashbury Street house as the primary setting for many of the adventures of the main characters.\n\nChinatown\n\nChinatown is a colorful and bustling area of San Francisco. It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods of its kind in the nation.\n\n“Big Trouble in Little China,” starring Kurt Russell, was shot on location in Chinatown and showcases the iconic gate at Bush and Grant Streets.\n\nYou’ll also see Chinatown in “The OA.”\n\nImage via San Francisco Travel Association\n\nChinatown is one of the areas of San Francisco portrayed in “The Joy Luck Club.”\n\nChestnut Street\n\n“Bullitt,” a thriller directed by Peter Yates, features actor Steve McQueen in one of his most well-known roles.\n\nScene from “Bullitt”\n\nOne of the scenes includes an epic car chase, taking viewers on a roller coaster ride along the steep streets of San Francisco.\n\nIt includes glimpses of Chestnut Street, along with Fisherman’s’ Wharf, Hyde Street, Laguna Street, Leavenworth Street, and Guadalupe Canyon Parkway.\n\nPotrero Hill\n\nPotrero Hill was another setting for the infamous car chase scene in “Bullitt.”\n\nThis neighborhood also served as the shooting location for parts of “Pacific Heights.”\n\nChurch Street Muni Station\n\nThe Church Street Muni Station was featured in “48 Hours.”\n\nFort Point National Historic Site\n\nLocated at the end of Marine Drive in the Presidio, Fort Point National Historic Site is the location where Scott, the title character in “Ant-Man,” reflects on his past following his release from prison.\n\n“Vertigo” also features this historic site. This film often presents aerial shots of the city skyline and attractions.\n\nOther films that feature Fort Point include “In Foul Play,” “Dopamine,” “Petulia,” “Point Blank,” and “The Presidio.” Mel Brooks directed a spoof of “Vertigo” called “High Anxiety” that also featured several locations in San Francisco, including the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero Center’s atrium.\n\nKezar Stadium\n\nLocated in Golden Gate Park, Kezar Stadium is featured in “Dirty Harry.”\n\nThe Press Club\n\nIn “Looking,” a film focused on the LGBTQ+ culture of San Francisco, filmmakers used lesser-known attractions in the city to create a more genuine representation. One example is The Press Club, where a character goes on a date.\n\nHarvey Milk Plaza\n\nNearly all the outdoor scenes featured in “Milk” were filmed at the actual historic locations where the situations being represented took place. These locations include Harvey Milk Plaza, Twin Peaks Tavern, and the Human Rights Campaign Action Center and Store.\n\nPacific Coast Stock Exchange\n\nIn “The Pursuit of Happyness,” the main character becomes inspired in his career path after speaking to a successful man, and several scenes are filmed at the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.\n\nSan Francisco Zoo\n\nA number of scenes in “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” feature San Francisco attractions, including the San Francisco Zoo, where the apes free their fellow primates during an uprising.\n\nSt. Paul’s Church\n\nIn “Sister Act,” Whoopi Goldberg’s character hides from her mobster boyfriend in St. Paul’s Church, located in San Francisco’s Noe Valley.\n\n“Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit” also featured several locations in San Francisco, including the Bank of America Building and the City College of San Francisco.\n\nMacondray Lane\n\nOne of the settings in “Tales of the City” was Macondray Lane, where you can see the steps located across from 1832 Taylor Street.\n\nHawk Hill\n\nHawk Hill in the Marin Headlands is the headquarters for Life Foundation in “Venom.”\n\nThe Mission District\n\n“Blue Jasmine” features scenes at a number of spots in San Francisco, including the Mission District, where the main character’s sister lives and works.\n\nAnother film showcasing this area of San Francisco is “La Mission.”\n\nUnion Square\n\nUnion Square was used in “The Conversation,” a Francis Ford Coppola film.\n\nSan Francisco War Memorial\n\n“So I Married an Axe Murderer” is set in San Francisco and includes scenes shot at the San Francisco War Memorial, the Fog City diner, Coit Tower, and the Palace of Fine Arts.\n\nCoit Tower was also featured in “Dr. Doolittle” and “The Enforcer.”\n\nPacific Heights\n\nThe Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco was the location of a mansion in “Basic Instinct” and was featured in several scenes.\n\nWashington Square\n\nWashington Square is visible in the backdrop of “Bedazzled.”\n\nExcelsior District\n\nIn “The Princess Diaries,” the home representing Mia Thermopolis’ character’s residence is actually a firehouse in San Francisco’s Excelsior District on Brazil Avenue.\n\nLombard Street\n\nLombard Street is a twisty avenue that often represents the city’s hilly layout in films.\n\nCheck out some of the top filming locations in San Francisco, then and now.
