        "text": "movie Inception, in which master director Christopher Nolan took his audience to the realm of dreams, was a worldwide success and became known as a masterpiece. The movie, which was nominated for an Oscar in eight categories, embraced awards in four categories and was credited as one of Nolan's best works and took its place in the history of cinema. If you look at the Inception movie review, you will see the love of many people for this film. But have you ever wondered where was Inception filmed? Where was the ski scene in Inception filmed? What is the movie Inception about? The Inception full movie film was filmed not only in one country but in six different countries! Firstly, \"Where was Inception filmed?\" The shooting of the movie, which began in the United Kingdom's Bedfordshire region, continued in Canada's Alberta region, which is a great location for epic mountain scenes. Subsequent filming was done in six different countries, including regions such as Morocco, Japan, France, and the United States of America. Let's take a closer look at these locations and you will see our Inception Movie Review from a tourism perspective.\n\n1. Alberta, Canada\n\nWhere was the ski scene in Inception filmed? The ski resort of Fortress Mountain Alberta, Canada was the location for the climactic scenes of Inception movie. One of the most interesting places for tourism in Canada is the western province of Alberta. It was named after the daughter of Queen Victoria Louise Carolina Alberta. For tourists, there is plenty of space: wild forests, clean rivers, and rocky mountains. Hares and ducks, squirrels and elks, carefully protected by the state, feel so safe that they are not afraid to go out into cities and towns to buy themselves treats. Alberta has a dry continental climate. Winter is cold and summer is warm, this must be taken into account when choosing clothes that you will take with you on the road because winter frosts here sometimes reach 51 degrees, but this applies only to the northern point of the province. But summer is not far behind - in the south of Alberta, the temperature can rise to 40 degrees!\n\n2. Morocco\n\nMorocco is another exotic location for the Inception movie. Located at the northwest end of the African continent, Morocco is surrounded by the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean in the north, Algeria in the east, Mauritania in the south, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west. Rabat, one of the most tourist-attracting regions with its narrow streets, old buildings, historical monuments, and 17th-century fortress, is the capital of Morocco and also an important teaching center. Fes, Marrakesh, Casablanca, Meknes, Tangier, Agadir, Mohammedia, El Jadida are other cities of this amazing country. The most colorful square of Marrakesh is the square of Jemaa el-Fna, which means 'Infinity Square'. With mobile kitchens, juice vendors, snake-monkey players, fortune tellers, henna-burning women, dancers in traditional clothes, this square is a fairground and tells a lot about Moroccan culture. Islamic culture in mosques, Andalusian culture in gardens and fountains, and French culture influences on the structure of buildings. It can be observed that it is also influenced by other cultures in Africa. Morocco is a country with various climates in terms of its geographical location. While temperate climates are encountered in cities along the ocean, a desert climate can be encountered in areas close to Atlas Mountain. Summers are hot and winters are mild. As we go towards the inner parts, the Mediterranean climate begins to be seen and there is abundant rainfall. It is recommended to go to the country during the winter months for a trip without getting overwhelmed by hot and drought conditions.\n\n3. Tokyo, Japan\n\nThe next destination for the movie Inception is Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo, the capital and most populous city of Japan, is one of the largest metropolises in the world, with 37,3 million population. It is among the most expensive cities to live in. This city, whose history dates back to many years, used to be a small fishing town and now it has become the capital of the east. Tokyo's old name is \"Edo\". With the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Edo 1603, the economy began to develop in the field of culture. Later, in 1868, Emperor Meiji ended the shogun's rule and changed the name of this place to Tokyo. Japan is an island country located in the Pacific Ocean in East Asia. Tokyo is located on the shores of Tokyo Bay in the central part of Honshu, one of the islands forming the country. The best time to travel to Tokyo is in the spring and autumn seasons.
