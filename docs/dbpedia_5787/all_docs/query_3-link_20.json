        "text": "2007\n\nCity Locations\n\nSurrey and New Westminster, British Columbia (Canada); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio\n\nLocation Styles\n\nCabin, Federal Building, Helicopter, Industrial Style, Mountain Huts, Rustic\n\nAbout Shooter\n\nThe action thriller Shooter was directed by Antoine Fuqua and features Mark Wahlberg, Danny Glover, and Michael PeÃ±a. The movie is based on Stephen Hunter's 1993 novel Point of Impact and its screenplay was written by Jonathan Lemkin. It premiered in the United States on March 23rd, 2007. Lorenzo di Bonaventura produced it via Di Bonaventura Pictures, and it was distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States.\n\nThe plot of Shooter follows Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg), a retired marine sniper recruited for a mission to track down an assassin threatening to kill the President of the United States. With his expert precision as a marksman, Swagger must evade capture by police and corrupt government officials trying to cover up their involvement in the assassination conspiracy. All while trying to uncover the true identity of the would-be killer before it's too late.\n\nAlthough some critics lauded the exciting storyline and strong performances from Wahlberg and PeÃ±a, Shooter only received a 47% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. According to the consensus among critics on the site, the movie is typical of other mindless action-thrillers with an unrealistic plot and numerous plot holes. It has also been nominated for a World Stunt Award in the Best High Work category.\n\nShooter Locations\n\nFor the 2007 action movie Shooter, most of the filming occurred in British Columbia, Canada. Known for its mountainous ranges and Pacific coastline, this area provided an ideal backdrop for the film's various scenes. Locations such as Kamloops, Mission, Ashcroft, Cache Creek, and New Westminster were used to shoot multiple scenes in the movie. For example, Swagger's escape was filmed along the Fraser River in New Westminster, while Kamloops served as an ideal spot where the North and South Thompson Rivers meet. It is also worth mentioning that a spectacular car chase scene that culminates with the vehicle plunging into the river was shot on 6th Street off Westminster Quay.\n\nThe scenes portraying the assassination were shot in Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park, specifically in front of Independence Hall. The filmmakers used the exteriors of a church steeple at New Street and North 4th Street to create the site where the sniper was positioned. They combined it with a view from another building to create an imaginary location within the park. The final scene was filmed in the Mammoth Lakes Basin, California.\n\nIn short, a trip to any of these shooting locations would be worthwhile for anyone interested in appreciating nature or exploring the culture of the British Columbia region. The sites are still as breathtakingly beautiful as they were when used during the production of Shooter, from towering mountain ranges and picturesque rivers to calm lakes and serene valleys. Not only are there plenty of places to sightsee but also local experiences like fishing and camping are available for visitors. All these factors make British Columbia an iconic destination for travelers worldwide.\n\nIn the opening scene, retired sniper Bob Lee Swagger lives in a cabin in the Wyoming mountains, enjoying his solitude away from government interference. Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) and his associates, Payne (Elias Koteas) and Dobbler (Jonathan Lloyd Walker), visit Swagger to ask for his help on a dangerous mission. This scene perfectly encapsulates the thrilling nature of Shooter 2007 as it sets the tone for what will come throughout the movie.\n\nThe iconic image of this scene was captured when Johnson confronts Swagger about why he should take on such a risky task â Swagger's stoic face and hardened expression says it all. This tense moment has become one of the most memorable scenes in Shooter 2007, symbolizing Swagger's transformation from being away from society to taking up arms against a common enemy.\n\nThe scene was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood, located in the San Fernando Valley area of California. Established in 1912, Universal Studios is still a beloved destination for television and film production fans. Movie lovers can take a tour of the studio grounds to see where classic films have been filmed over the years.\n\nYou can find it less than 30 milesâ drive from LAX, and about 10 miles northwest of downtown LA.\n\nSearch Los Angeles Filming Locations\n\nThe assassination scene in Shooter takes place in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is a pivotal moment for the movie when Johnson, Payne, Dobbler, Swagger, and Officer Timmons (Alan C. Peterson) are gathered outside a church tower. Johnson claims that the shooter is inside and they will take him down just after the president begins to speak. All eyes are on Officer Timmons as his gun is not properly holstered. This establishes an intense atmosphere with potential violence on the horizon. Swagger advises Johnson to instruct his men to take down the shooter as the president moves towards the stage. However, the Archbishop is shot in the head before they can act. At the same time, Timmons shoots Swagger in the shoulder.\n\nThe filming location for the scene was Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, specifically in front of Independence Hall. However, for the sniper's perspective, the church steeple at the corner of New Street and North 4th Street and an elevated view from a nearby building were used. This location has immense historical significance due to its ties to Americaâs formation as well as national and international symbols like the Liberty Bell which spark ideas of independence, safety, and unity across borders. You can also take a tour and visit Independence Hall.\n\nThe best way to get to Independence National Historical Park is via public transportation or car. You can find it right in the heart of Philly, roughly a mile away from City Hall.\n\nScout Philadelphia Filming Locations\n\nThe escape scene is an intense one, while running away, Swagger tracks down Memphis and seeks his assistance. Memphis (Michael PeÃ±a) pulls out his firearm, but Swagger swiftly pins him down on the ground. He restrains Memphis by handcuffing him to a gate and explains that he has been framed and Timmons is involved in the conspiracy. Swagger then steals Memphis's gun and drives off in his FBI car. In order to hide from the police helicopters searching for him, he drives into a car wash.\n\nThis scene was filmed alongside the Fraser River in New Westminster, Canada. The Fraser River is a renowned river in British Columbia that originates from Fraser Pass close to Blackrock Mountain. Simon Fraser, who embarked on an expedition for the North West Company from present-day Prince George to almost the mouth of the river in 1808, inspired the river's name. There are various parks along this area, including Westminster Quay Boardwalk and Quayside Park, which have stunning views of the river and surrounding landscape.\n\nThe easiest way to get to this location is by driving or taking public transport such as Skytrain or bus to New Westminster Station. From there you can walk or take a short taxi ride towards Fraser River where you will find these beautiful parks along the riverbank.\n\nFind Vancouver Filming Locations\n\nThe iconic car chase scene from Shooter is one of the most memorable scenes in the entire movie. It starts with Swagger driving out of a car wash and being spotted by cops, leading to a thrilling car chase through the city streets.\n\nThe high-speed chase ends when a pickup truck smashes his car, causing it to spin around and crash directly into the Delaware River (that was actually shot near the Fraser River). This stunt was made even more impressive due to its complexity, as it involved precision driving and close coordination with other actors and vehicles involved in the scene.\n\nThe car chase stunt was filmed at Pattullo Bridge, a through arch bridge located in British Columbia, Canada, that links New Westminster to Surrey across the Fraser River. The regular crossing of the Fraser River was established in 1882 and was named after Thomas Dufferin Pattullo, who served as the 22nd Premier of British Columbia. As this is a public location, anyone can visit this place and check it out in person.\n\nYou can get there from Vancouver by driving around 17 miles southeast of Vancouver. Simply take the Trans-Canada Hwy/BC-1 E and follow the signs for New Westminster. Once you get to the Fraser River, this iconic bridge is hard to miss.\n\nUncover Vancouver Video Shoot Locations\n\nSwagger plans a meeting with Johnson and Meachum (Ned Beatty) in Montana and informs the FBI. When the two arrive, Payne holds Sarah (Kate Mara) hostage with a gun. Memphis acts as a distraction, attracting gunfire from Johnson's snipers, which allows Swagger to take them out and rescue Sarah. Sarah then shoots and kills Payne. Swagger confronts Meachum with a recording of Sczerbiak's (Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija) confession about the massacre. However, Meachum hints that the corruption ss extensive, so Swagger burns the recording because he knew it would put him in danger.\n\nThis scene was filmed at Rainbow Mountain, which is located in British Columbia, Canada, within the Pacific Ranges area of the Coast Mountains Range near Whistler. It is a broad, glaciated summit forming a northeastern wall of Callaghan Valley near Sproatt Mountain peak. It provides a stunning view from its meeting on the surrounding area, including glaciers and snow-covered peaks. Unsurprisingly, the area has been a popular destination for hiking, snowshoeing, or ski touring due to its beauty since the late 19th century.\n\nRainbow Mountain can be reached by car starting from Whistler Village in around 50 minutes. Whistler itself is found about two hours from Vancouver International Airport.\n\nNorth Vancouver Filming Locations Guide"
