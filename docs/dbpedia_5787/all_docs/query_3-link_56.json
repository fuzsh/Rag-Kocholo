Just choose your clips, then add titles, music and effects. Or let Magic Movie or Storyboards help craft your project. iMovie even supports 4K video for stunning cinema-quality films. And that, everyone, is a wrap.\n\nEdit Like a Pro\n\nWith iMovie, create professional‑looking videos without an editing degree. Easily add photos and videos to projects, trim clips with your finger, add seamless transitions and fade audio like a pro. You can also import and edit ProRes video and add Apple ProRAW images to your movies and trailers.\n\nExtra-Special Effects\n\nMake action shots more exciting by slowing them down. Let viewers fly through scenes by speeding them up. Or add a broadcast feel to your school report with picture‑in‑picture and split‑screen effects.\n\nMake Movies\n\nEasy.
