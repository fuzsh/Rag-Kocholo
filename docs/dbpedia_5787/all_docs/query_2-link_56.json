        "text": "Venice California History Site -\n\nMovie Making in\n\nVenice and Ocean Park\n\nThe material is copyrighted Â© 2013 by Jeffrey Stanton.\n\nRevised August 18, 2013\n\nVenice's unique architecture, canal network and amusement piers provided Hollywood's newly established motion picture industry with colorful settings for early silent pictures. Thomas Ince was one of the first to bring a motion picture camera crew to Venice. Rivals studios like Bison, Biograph, Vitagraph and Liberty were quick to follow. Movie companies became so numerous and disruptive to business, that for a time in 1915, there was talk of banning them from Venice's streets. However, no action was taken, and in later years movies like Buster Keaton's \"The Camera Man\" and several \"Our Gang\" comedies were filmed along the beach and on the pier. Harold Lloyd leaped from a canal bridge, Mary Pickford was rowed down the Grand Canal and Mabel Norman emerged from the ocean beside the pier with a fish on her head. Some Keystone and Max Sennett Comedies were also filmed in Venice.\n\nMovie making in the surf near the Lick Pier. - 1926\n\nVenice was also a favorite of Hollywood's stars. Many purchased homes and summer cottages to enjoy the beach life. Charlie Chaplin in the 20's rented a penthouse apartment at the Waldorf Hotel on Ocean Front Walk. Night life at cabarets like the Ship Cafe and King George Hotel's roof garden attracted many screen celebrities. Private parties, like the one in 1937 given by Carole Lombard at the Venice Pier's Fun House, were attended by stars like Cary Grant, Virginia Field, Dennis O'Keefe and others.\n\nEven after World War II, when Venice lost its amusement piers and acquired a seedy, run down look, movie producers took advantage of its locale. Orson Wells in 1958 converted downtown Venice into a Mexican border town and installed a border crossing on Ocean Front Walk. Roger Corman used Venice as a locale for his horror movies.\n\nCurrently there are several independent studios in Venice. Producer/director Tony Bill's studio is on Market Street and Roger Corman's studio is located on Main Street. Arnold Schwarzeneggar's offices are on Main Street above his restaurant Schatzi. There are also several digital production houses like Digital Domain in Venice. Many actors, producers, directors, screen writers, cinema photographers, and movie stars live in Venice. Those living in the Venice canals include Matt Groening (Simpson's creator), Ed O'Neil (Married with Children), Eric von Denton (Disney movies), Orson Bean (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman) and his wife Alley Mills (Wonder Years). Those living along the beach south of Venice Boulevard to the Marina Channel include Wesley Snipes, and Nicholas Cage (recently moved). Others living in other sections of the community are Julia Roberts, Oliver Stone, and Dennis Hopper.\n\nCONSIDER THIS LIST A WORK IN PROGRESS. It is definitely incomplete, often inaccurate and sometimes plain wrong. While I've personally viewed many of these movies, others and especially television shows were input by others. Marc Wanamaker, a noted film archivist and historian, supplied many of the more obscure films, especially the silents.
