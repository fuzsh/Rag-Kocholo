        "text": "If you’ve been to the movies, you’ve been to California, or at least to a part of it. The Golden State has been immortalized on the silver screen throughout cinematic history, and it's no surprise that Hollywood doesn’t venture out too far from the studio when looking for inspiration on locations.\n\nValley girls, cops, historical figures, and detectives have all found a place in California's cinema story. While it’s tough to pick and choose which movies set in California do the best job of portraying the state, a few definitely stand out as great cinematic experiences. Here are some of our favorites movies set in California across several genres and decades—have fun viewing!\n\nMovies Set In Northern California\n\n3. Milk\n\nDirector: Gus Van Sant\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nAnother film based on real-life events, Milk tells the story of Harvey Milk, an American activist who became California's first openly gay elected official. This movie set in San Francisco tells the story of how Milk became an iconic figure in LGBTQ+ history. An emotional roller coaster and an inspiration for all, Milk is a definite must-add to your “to watch” list.\n\n4. Blue Jasmine\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nRelease Date: 2013\n\nThe critically acclaimed film Blue Jasmine tells the story of one woman’s attempt at starting over in San Francisco after a rough patch in life. After losing her marriage and her sanity, Jasmine (Cate Blanchett), a wealthy New York socialite, decides to start over in San Francisco with her sister. Much of the movie is set in San Francisco and features Ocean Beach, Chinatown, and beautiful views of the bay.\n\nMovies Set in Los Angeles\n\n6. Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nRelease Date: 2019\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood revisits 1969 Los Angeles, where fading TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) strive for fame and success in an industry they hardly recognize anymore. An ode to the Golden Age of Hollywood, the movie set in L.A. features a large cast and multiple storylines. Tarantino does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of a time and place vastly different from what we see now.\n\n7. Clueless\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nRelease Date: 1995\n\nClueless tells the story of adolescence in the 1990s in a hilariously entertaining and surprisingly heartwarming way. Based on Jane Austen’s novel “Emma,” this 1995 movie set in L.A. satirizes the lives of ultra-rich teens from Beverly Hills by following Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) through her daily struggles. Shopping montages, iconic one-liners, and a dreamy Paul Rudd make this movie set in California a must-watch—it’s one of the best teen movies of all time.\n\n8. La La Land\n\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\n\nRelease Date: 2016\n\nLa La Land by Damien Chazelle is perhaps the peak of L.A. film inspiration. The 2016 Oscar winner is not only filmed and set in Los Angeles, but it also pays homage to everything from traffic and dingy gigs to massive opportunities and beautiful attractions. A love letter to the City of Angels, La La Land’s professed affection for L.A. makes it one of the most endearing movies set in California to watch.\n\n9. The Nice Guys\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nRelease Date: 2016\n\nThe Nice Guys is another movie set in Los Angeles that travels back in time to the 1970s. The movie follows a mismatched pair of private investigators searching for answers in the cases of a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star—this hilarious roller coaster of a film will make you fall off the couch. A buddy movie through and through, this movie set in California is a 70s feel-good ride you should definitely watch.\n\nMovies Set in San Diego\n\n10. Top Gun\n\nDirector: Tony Scott\n\nRelease Date: 1986\n\nAfter being accepted into Miramar's elite Fighter School that’s also known as \"Top Gun,\" Tom Cruise’s character Maverick tries to get a fresh start in his career and competes to be the best in his class. Despite the fact that Top Gun received mixed reviews at the time of its release, the film was praised for its action sequences and quickly became a fan-favorite. This movie set in San Diego is definitely a classic and arguably the film that turned Tom Cruise into the movie superstar he’s known as today.\n\n11. Almost Famous\n\nDirector: Cameron Crowe\n\nRelease Date: 2000\n\nOcean Beach is a laid-back community in San Diego with a 1970s hippie vibe, which is why it’s the perfect setting for the award-winning comedy-drama Almost Famous. The movie set in San Diego tells the story of a young journalist who’s still in high school but has the opportunity to follow a band called Stillwater and write a story for Rolling Stone magazine. A coming of age story in its essence, Almost Famous is considered one of the greatest in its genre and a definite must-watch among the movies set in California.\n\n11. Top Gun\n\nDirector: Tony Scott\n\nRelease Date: 1986\n\nAfter being accepted into Miramar's elite Fighter School that’s also known as \"Top Gun,\" Tom Cruise’s character Maverick tries to get a fresh start in his career and competes to be the best in his class.
