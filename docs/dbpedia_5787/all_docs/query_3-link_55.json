        "text": "Still via Django Unchained.\n\nThe extreme wide shot or extreme long shot is all about showing the world in which the story takes place. In an extreme wide you will see large landscapes in the frame. Whether it is the desert or outer space, the audience should get a feel for the time and the place they are about to spend the next two hours.\n\nThough characters can be introduced in an extreme wide, they would be very tiny in context to the backdrop, which is what you are highlighting with this shot. An extreme wide shot is often an establishing shot, which is explained below.\n\nWhat are the 7 basic camera movements?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nA camera shot might show nothing but a person’s iris or the entirety of a city’s landscape. But to facilitate communication between Filmmakers, general terms are applied to the seven most basic camera shots, which are:\n\nClose-up\n\nExtreme close-up\n\nMedium shot\n\nLong shot\n\nExtreme long shot\n\nHigh angle\n\nLow angle\n\nStill via Days of Heaven.\n\nA wide shot, often referred to as a long shot, puts characters in context to the backdrop you establish in an extreme wide shot. The characters can be seen from head to toe and you see them in relation to the location or each other.\n\nYou can use a wide shot to show how your character is small in relation to the vast surroundings, like a little girl in awe of a large painting or a woman carrying water over a large plain. Of course, a wide shot might not have a character in it at all and it, too, can be used as an establishing shot.\n\nWhen the term long shot is emphasized, it can mean that the camera is farther away from the subject, making them even smaller.\n\nA wide shot can also be a master shot, which is used to introduce a new location like a dining room or restaurant. It gives the audience a sense of geography so when the camera goes in tighter, they can understand who is where.\n\nStill via Thor.\n\nA full shot is different from the wide because it focuses more on the character in the frame. The character is full body from head to toe again, but the location is no longer the focus. In this shot you might want to show how a character dresses or how a character moves: awkwardly, confidently, etc.\n\nYou can also reveal what they are doing, like packing a suitcase or ordering a train ticket. You can give the viewer information but not all of it, yet.\n\nHow many types of shots are there in film?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nCamera shots are generally organized according to the seven most common types. That being said, there are many more subsets of those shots. For instance, you can have not just a high angle but an extreme high angle. You can have not just an extreme long shot but a panorama shot. It all comes down to the specificity with which a camera shot is described.\n\nStill via Titanic.\n\nThe medium shot shows your character from the waist up. (There is a debate about this, but you will get a feel for it.) In the old westerns, the character was often shown from the hip up which is now known as a cowboy shot.\n\nAgain, this shot is about revealing information. You can see more detail than you can in a wide shot. The reason the westerns had to reveal the hips is because of the gun holsters. If you didn’t show the hips, when a cowboy was ready to draw you would lose a lot of important action.\n\nMedium shots are often used in dialog scenes. As we get closer to our subjects we can see things that we wouldn’t catch in a wide, like body language. We can see crossed arms or someone who talks with their hands.\n\nStill via The Shining.\n\nA close-up frames the character’s face. In a close-up shot one can see even more detail that tells us how a character feels. A close-up highlights emotional clues in the eyes and you can see a twitch or a tear that you might miss in a medium shot. It is by its nature more intimate so the effect is often that the audience can feel what the character is feeling.\n\nA close-up can also be used to show things such as a tapping foot or the sliding of a ring on a finger, but these shots should be used sparingly and have a flow, otherwise, they can be jarring. Most importantly, they should mean something because the audience will be looking for importance in anything you decide to show them.\n\nWhat are shot types?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nCamera shot types are general designations given to different shots so that Filmmakers can more easily communicate and understand each other when discussing what the camera is capturing for a given shot.\n\nStill via Seinfeld.\n\nThe establishing shot is included in this list because it’s so important to let the viewers know where they are as the story moves from location to location in a film. The establishing shot can be a mixture of shot sizes, so it is technically not a shot type.\n\nIt tells the viewer where in the world the story takes place. It can be an extreme wide sweeping shot with a crane or a drone to show a particular time period or details of a location, like a burned forest or traffic jam or it can be a wide exterior of a building like a museum. You can also use tighter shots that show pieces of a location like an office.\n\nFor example, you can show a close-up shot of wheelchair wheels, an IV and an MRI machine to show you are in a hospital. But one must choose those shots wisely. A shot of an MRI machine should mean something.\n\nPerhaps someone is getting diagnosed, or perhaps the main character is the operator of the MRI machine. Deciding what information you want to reveal to the audience can be the difference between hooking viewers or confusing them.\n\nAll these shots are used to “cover” a scene. Each time the camera is moved is a new setup and each of these pieces are used to cut together your movie. What kind of coverage you get will vary from scene to scene, depending on what you want to highlight from moment to moment.\n\nYou must consider story points, action, and emotion. There is a myth that you can cover each scene with a wide, a medium and close-up shots, but if you do this without thought, your audience might lose interest. Besides, you have a vision in your head and I am sure it is much more interesting than that! But don’t overthink it.\n\nA scene can be covered in one wide shot – a guy walks out of a restaurant and gets into his car. A medium shot might be all it takes to show someone go to a Bank Teller to make a withdrawal. You shouldn’t get coverage just for the sake of getting it. Choose shots that will tell your story. If the guy going to the Bank Teller intends to rob the bank, then perhaps a close-up will reveal his sweaty brow and nerves.\n\nAs you get a grasp on the types of shots in a film, move on to learn about camera angles, composition, and when and how to use camera moves. All of these things are creative ways to get coverage and to help you tell your story visually and viscerally so you, too, can make an impact."
