        "text": "Inception (2010) directed by Christopher Nolan is an example of modern film making at its best in my opinion. It remains 5 years on from its release, one my favourite films. It adopts so many cinematic techniques to drive the narrative. But today I have been looking specifically at Wardrobe and framing.\n\nWardrobe can play a very important part in a film. They can drive a narrative by telling us things about the camera. In scenes depicted in the ‘real world’ Joseph Gordon Levitt’s character Arthur is almost at all times dressed in a three piece suit. What does this say about his character?\n\nWell, in the film Arthur is in charge of the planning and making sure everything runs smoothly – this is reflected in his styling. His crisp suit combined with un-fussy slicked back hair is almost a mirroring of his anal-organisational manner, he’s all about the business.\n\nhttp://wall.alphacoders.com/by_sub_category.php?id=171899\n\nHow does the framing of this scene drive narrative?\n\nInception is quite a conceptual film. Its based on the idea that dreams are accessible and can be manipulated by agents known as ‘extractors’. The framing of this shot in unconventional, taken at an angle but the reason for this is that the scene itself in unconventional. Its conveyed to the audience that the room is spinning (due to a previous dreamscape being jeopardised) through special effects. the titled framing of this scene just adds to this illusion and makes it all the more convincing for the viewer – which means we don’t question it and allows us to watch the film contently and not question validity of the scene. Obviously in reality, this isn’t physically possible which is why its been included, it further our understanding that this is a dream world where anything can happen."
