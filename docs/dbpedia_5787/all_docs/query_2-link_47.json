        "text": "The Film LA team helps get the permit to the finish line. And supports the success of the shoot. Their monitors are partners and informative where they have a healthy balance of managing the crew, location, and neighbors.\n\nFilmLA has always been there to jump in and help out whenever any issues have arisen though the years, and I know many on their staff work the same long hours we do. They are dedicated individuals who tirelessly strive for the same goal we have; to keep the filming and production payroll here in LA where our families and homes are. They help us build and repair the delicate bridge we all have to cross to work everyday. It takes a great deal of talent, dedication and just plain hard work to do that on all sides.\n\nI produced a shoot last Friday and was at first upset that I needed a FilmLA Monitor. But, after meeting and working with him, he instantly became an asset to our production. Our Monitor was personable, professional able to flow with the ever-changing demands of production with ease, grace and humor. If you don’t work on-location, it’s really hard to explain. But, if he didn’t work for FilmLA, I would hire him myself.\n\nFilmLA has always come through for me quickly when I have had a location problem. The other day, I had clients in my car in a panic about not being able to film at a hotel. One call to FilmLA, and five minutes later, I was able to explain the situation. It certainly made me look good, being able to give them an answer so fast and to put the issue to rest.\n\nI really enjoy having the support of this agency backing up our department. I get an extra set of eyes and ears making sure everything is safe, smooth, and efficient. I really appreciate FilmLA managing the insurance and billing, allowing me to manage the project details.\n\nThank you so much for e-mail notification. It is a great step in helping me notify my tenants ahead of time. It takes me 72 hours of time processing paperwork to post the apartment building. At least I got to enjoy dinner yesterday without running out to the property.\n\nI would like to commend the crew and the crew managers for being courteous, thoughtful and considerate of the residents in the shoot area. […] We are all pleased to welcome the production crew and their staff to our neighborhood. If the production company needs further shoots in this area they are welcome.\n\nI just wanted to say how much I love online permitting. Now when we have a question about something, we can log on and look.\n\nWe at Flash Forward owe all of you a tremendous amount of applause – let’s say a standing ovation. Your efforts on our behalf during this production have been nothing but, if not beyond, stellar. With your support, we have the confidence that when this pilot goes to series there will be no doubt that shooting in Los Angeles is the only choice. Thank you again for your help, indulgence and cooperation in keeping our production on the right path.\n\nFilmLA representatives are very helpful in cutting my time spent on reviewing permits, they usually catch errors or missing items. The reservation staff is a great help to me catching cast and crew sizes and if we’re able to accommodate them at our beach locations based on our beach conditions.\n\nThanks for your help with City Hall. Please pass this on: our FilmLA Monitors were great! I cannot imagine having filmed there without their help. I felt like they had everything under control there and wish they’d been involved earlier. A big thanks to them on my behalf."
