        "text": "We all know the story. Young Will Smith gets in trouble in West Philadelphia, where he was born and raised, so he is sent to live with his well-to-do aunt and uncle in Bel-Air. He’s a fish out of the water and a counterpart to his cousin Carlton, played memorably by Alfonso Ribiero. This show helped turn Will Smith (the actor, not the character) into a star.\n\nSure, many of us grew up watching Saved by the Bell in the ‘90s. It was a huge part of our childhoods, which is why the phrase, “I’m so excited! I’m so excited! I’m so scared!” has any cultural meaning. As adults, we can recognize that this show about the misadventures of some kids at Bayside was maybe not the best-quality show. And yet, we’ll remember it forever.\n\nFrom the moment we were welcomed to the O.C., this teen soap had made its cultural impact. The O.C. was another fish-out-of-water tale with a more seedy underbelly than the largely fun Fresh Prince. For a few years, it seemed like The O.C. was as popular with young audiences as any show.\n\nArrested Development is also set in the O.C. (don’t call it that), but it’s a much different show. To many, the first three seasons of adventures for the Bluth family are as funny as any sitcom. The Netflix seasons weren’t as well received, but that doesn’t undercut those three seasons on FOX.\n\nThe idea of Beverly Hills as the playground of the rich and famous was perpetuated thanks to Beverly Hills, 90210. Was it a realistic show? No, but it’s not like anybody cared. They were in it for the soapy stories and the cast of young stars. These were definitely not Beverly Hillbillies, to reference another show that could have made this list.\n\nFrom the Golden Gate Bridge sighting in the opening credits to the famous Tanner house, this show oozed San Francisco. After all, Danny Tanner (R.I.P. Bob Saget) was a co-host of the fictional Wake Up, San Francisco. This family sitcom was a staple of childhoods, so much so that Fuller House was able to squeeze out multiple seasons on Netflix in recent years.\n\nDue to his beat being Los Angeles, Detective Columbo often found himself dealing with the rich and famous. All these snooty folks believed they had the brains and bucks to outwit the detective in the rumpled raincoat. Each time, they were outdone by Peter Falk’s iconic character. That’s all we have to say about this show. Actually, just one more thing…\n\nJim Rockford had a nicer car than Columbo, and he often needed it because he was constantly getting in car chases. Rockford was all over the L.A. area as a private investigator. Part of what made the show so good was that Rockford was not living some glamorous Los Angeles lifestyle. He was always scrounging for cash, living in a mobile home by the beach, and took as many beatings as he gave.\n\nEventually, the show moved to Hawaii, but Baywatch was set in California for most of its run. Remember, we said this was about the most memorable California shows. Baywatch didn’t exactly win awards for storytelling, but it had a cultural cache and captured the zeitgeist thanks to some form-fitting red bathing suits.\n\nBarry is the newest show on this list, and its run isn’t over, with a fourth and final season yet to come. That being said, it earned its spot here. It’s ensconced in Los Angeles and the margins of the entertainment industry. Plus, it won both Bill Hader and Henry Winkler Emmys.\n\nIf you are running afoul of the law on the highways of California, you’d better watch out. CHiPs is one of those quintessentially cheesy procedurals of a particular era, but we all know the name “Ponch,” and we all remember those motorcycles and uniforms.\n\nNow, most shows set in the world of television are set in Los Angeles, but the one we have representing that industry here is The Larry Sanders Show. It’s fitting because 30 Rock is the best show about making television, give or take. The cast was incredible, and it made great use of celebrities playing themselves to lampoon their images.\n\nModern Family was the rare family sitcom set in L.A. that was also filmed in L.A. Well, it was a mockumentary-style show, so being able to go out into the world and shoot without needing to carefully frame certain landmarks out probably helped. The show won 22 Primetime Emmys, so Modern Family was as successful as the family it followed.\n\nMaybe you didn’t watch it, but odds are somebody you know watched The Big Bang Theory. It was one of the last massively watched sitcoms. It was so popular that its reruns were the most watched show on TBS. Sheldon and company lived in Pasadena, and from there, all the “Bazingas” originated.\n\nWell, “L.A.” is right in the title. There are law shows set all over the country. This one was smack dab in the middle of Los Angeles. It proved quite popular at the time, including winning the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series four times.\n\nArt imitated life imitated art on The Monkees. It was about a band trying to make it in Los Angeles, starring actors and musicians trying to make it in Los Angeles. Sure, the band was prefabricated, but Mickey, Mike, Peter, and Davy were all talented and starred in a more surreal and kinetic show than you might remember.\n\nOne of those classic TV premises about somebody living where they aren’t supposed to be that proved popular for a while, Three’s Company was frothy but popular. Jack Tripper, played by John Ritter, jumped through hoops to continue living with two of his female friends. Hijinks ensued. They always do. Jack, Chrissy, and the gang down at the Regal Beagle lived in Santa Monica.\n\nWhile she has another state in her name, Hannah is decidedly a California girl. The series begins with Miley Stewart’s family moving from Tennessee to Malibu, where she maintains her secret identity as a pop superstar. Hey, it was a show for kids on the Disney Channel. We’ll let any iffy plot points slide, especially when Miley Cyrus is the star.\n\nNeptune may not be a real city in California, but Veronica Mars still feels like California through and through. It could be set in almost any California city that gets overlooked because it isn’t Los Angeles or San Francisco. Plus, we’re pretty sure that, by law, half of detective noirs have to be set in California.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Monk came Psych. It moved down the coast from the bustling big city of San Francisco to the smaller, more scenic Santa Barbara. Psych is the most popular show set in that city, which isn’t exactly a tiny town. With its ocean views and many beaches, Santa Barbara seems like a lovely place to live. Aside from the unusual number of difficult-to-solve murders in Psych, that is. While the show has ended, they have made three TV movies that have kept the universe of the show going.\n\nAs teenagers were becoming more and more of a “thing,” we got Gidget. Based on a film, the show about a surfing, beach-loving teenage girl may have only lasted a season. However, this was in the 1960s, so one season meant 32 episodes. Also, Gidget was played by a young Sally Field, ensuring it would remain a well-remembered California show.\n\nSitting on the opposite side of the Bay from San Francisco is Oakland, which doesn’t get as much love from television. At least it got Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper, though. Mark Curry stars as Mr. Cooper, a former player for the Golden State Warriors who takes a job as a high school teacher. Curry was from Oakland, making him a fitting choice for the role.\n\nAnother of those shows with the city right in the title, which always makes a show more synonymous with its location. The Streets of San Francisco was a popular police procedural in the 1970s, running for five seasons. It also notably matched a former movie star with a future one. The two cops at the center of the show were played by Karl Malden and Michael Douglas.\n\nNot everybody who lives in Los Angeles is rich or in showbiz. Some of them are teachers, bartenders, or whatever Schmidt did for work. New Girl got off to a bit of a slow start with its high concept and “Adorkable” ad campaign. Eventually, though, it just became a hangout show about friends sharing a loft in Los Angeles, and that’s where it excelled."
