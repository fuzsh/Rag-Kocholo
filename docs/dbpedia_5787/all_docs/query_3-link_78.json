        "text": "01 of 04\n\nThe daytime diner and general store (Hope Junctions Antiques, Hope, N.J.)\n\nA proper tour of the original Friday the 13th filming locations lies just 60 miles northwest of New York City in New Jersey, and a complete expedition of the film's sets can be managed by fans who want to dedicate a whole day to sightseeing. First stop: Hope. With a population of approximately 2,000 people, the township is a quaint locale that will truly enchant Friday fans, especially those imaginative enough to match up their surroundings with the scenes and camera angles used by Cunningham. Following the 1958 flashback sequence, which serves as Friday the 13th's creepy introduction to the mysterious murderer, fans join up with Crystal Lake's cook, Annie (Robbi Morgan), 22 years later in present-day 1980. Looking for directions to the camp, she enters a small diner/general store where she meets the kindly truck driver Enos (Rex Everhart).\n\nFans can still visit the daytime diner (the nighttime one will come up later), which remains in its original location, but now exists as Hope Junction Antiques located at 331 High St. Charles and Lisa Iulo own the antique shop, which was once a Hard Times Coffee Shop. Take the time to enjoy this jewel of tourism in its own right, but once Friday fans have soaked up the shop, they need only head to their left outside the store to continue their journey back to Camp Blood. Two buildings down, fans can track Annie and Enos' path after he agrees to give her a ride, where the characters bump into \"Crazy\" Ralph (Walt Gorney). The two-story building, which is now an Era Burgdorff Realtors business, has been painted white, and it sits on the corner of Walnut Street and High Street next to a one-way road sign. And as devoted fans all know, that's where Ralph tries to warn Annie about her destination: \"It's got a death curse!\"\n\n03 of 04\n\nThe nighttime diner (Blairstown Diner, Blairstown, N.J.)\n\nOnly a 12-minute drive north of the antiques store, on Hope Blairstown Road, fans will find the Blairstown Diner. This is where the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer), spent most of that fateful night back in June of 1980. Unfortunately, Steve makes the mistake of returning to camp, and that's where he meets his end at the hands of the vengeful Mrs. Voorhees. The Blairstown Diner proudly promotes the fact that the eating establishment was \"featured in Friday the 13th,\" and both interior and exterior were shot at the restaurant. So, if you happen to get hungry on your Friday fandom walking tour, stop in for an omelet or griddle specialty.\n\nOnce fans finish up at the Blairstown Diner, they're only a three-minute walk north on Carhart Street, and there they can find the First National Bank building still standing brick-for-brick and column-for-column as it appeared in the film. This is part of Blairstown's famed historic district, and the FNB is where the exterior shots of Annie entering the daytime diner (a.k.a. the interior of Hope Junction Antiques) were filmed. There are a number of Friday the 13th-related stops to make while visiting the historic district, and Roy's Hall is one such must-see. The non-profit offers special screenings of Friday the 13th each year, so if fans plan out their trips perfectly, they can tour all the film's sets and see one of the best slasher movies of all time while in Blairstown, too.\n\n04 of 04\n\nCamp Crystal Lake (Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, Hardwick Township, N.J.)\n\nAfter having a fantastic time visiting Hope and Blairstown, it's time for the main event, so jump in the car and head 12 minutes north on Shannon Road. Your destination is the Hardwick Township of New Jersey. Take a left on Sand Pond Road, and you'll find Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco. While Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco has hosted thousands of Boy Scout troops since its inception in 1927, it is also where the majority of Friday the 13th was filmed.\n\nCourtesy of Crystal Lake Tours, fans can visit Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco and explore nearly every square inch of Friday the 13th's Camp Blood, which is an interactive dream come true. Tourists are virtually transported back to 1958, and they'll practically hear Claudette (Debra S. Hayes) and Barry (Willie Adams) singing \"Michael\" in the fellowship hall all over again. According to the tour, Hayes and Adams were dating in real life, and Friday fanatics will even visit the very loft where Mrs. Voorhees did away with the lovebirds, as they have the honor of being the film's first victims.\n\nBack outside, fans will find the original Crystal Lake sign hanging approximately 20 to 30 feet away from a replica of the Jeep that both Steve Christy and Mrs. Voorhees drove during the movie. The filmmakers simply used two different license plates to distinguish who the Jeep belonged to in the film. Several crew and cast members even signed the infamous Jeep on its back gate, including Adrienne King, Robbi Morgan, Ari Lehman, and special effects extraordinaire Tom Savini.\n\nJust nearby, a lonely canoe floats on the water. The Friday the 13th soundtrack resonates in the background, and fans will wait and wonder if Jason (Lehman) will pop out of the lake like he does when he frightens poor Alice (King) in the movie. Next, take a gander over to the Price Lodge, a.k.a. the Shower House, to see where Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) was slain by the killer.\n\nThe one sink where Marcie brushes her teeth remains, as does the lone light fixture that the murder weapon clangs against in the film. Savini decided to use a real axe, and made sure it clanged so that audiences would know it was authentic. That gimmick makes the terror all the more effective when Marcie slumps to her death with a separate (and fortunately fake axe) attached to her face via Savini's magnificent make-up effects.\n\nJack's (Kevin Bacon) quarters have been dubbed by his girlfriend's name, Brenda's cabin, and the interior appears much the same way it does when Mrs. Voorhees sticks the arrow through his throat. Further along the tour, fans will find the main cabin feels like it came out of a time capsule, too, and one can almost hear Jack's breakfast sizzling when Bacon cooks up his own bacon in the film. Even the \"Comanche\" sign hanging outside the main cabin has been perfectly replicated from the movie. There is also a chance to inspect the archery range where Brenda (Laurie Bartram) was shot down by Mrs. Voorhees, and a sign that reads \"Danger\" hangs in the same place Jason's mother left crooner Bing Crosby's son, Harry Crosby, hanging out at the generator shed.\n\nBut not everything about the filming location has remained the same. Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco's docks are now configured quite differently from the movie's, and the lifeguard tower has been significantly altered in appearance. However, the beach where Alice battles Mrs. Voorhees is eerily similar, and it's easy to envision the two of them engaged in their final battle to the death.\n\nFans can expect to walk up to a mile while taking in the campground, but the tours can last two or even three hours depending on the amount of time each group spends inspecting all of Friday the 13th's interior and exterior sets. Tours are offered in the mornings, afternoons, and evenings, but there's also a special \"flashlight\" session at night, which adds that spooky feel horror fans crave. Plus, some of the camp's other special activities include archery and canoeing sessions.\n\nDepending on the scheduled events, fans might even find Friday the 13th alumni in their midst, as the original cast and crew enjoy having reunions complete with Q&As at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco. For more information on upcoming events, visit the Crystal Lake Tours website. And don't forget to visit the gift shop to pick up your own sample of Crystal Lake's waters from the Angry Mother Bottling Co. Do it! You don't want to make Mrs. Voorhees angry."
