        "text": "Palm trees bearing coconuts are livening up Montreal's Ste-Catherine Street in the Village as film crews busily dress the commercial artery up to look like retro San Diego for a Hollywood feature film.\n\n\"Watching them do up all the store signs to make them look very 1950s is very fun,\" said Francis Gaudreault, who owns Armada, a retail store. \"Plus it adds a nice touch to the Village.\"\n\nThree feature films are being shot in the city currently, including one by Skydance Media. Skydance is behind an upcoming film with Apple Original Films staring Ryan Reynolds and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nCBC News attempted to confirm more information about the production, but a non-disclosure agreement prevents many of those involved from talking about it.\n\nThe filming is taking place between Panet and Visitation streets, and will be ongoing until May 10.\n\nThere will be some intermittent street and store closures during filming, but business owners are being compensated.\n\nNotices are hanging on surrounding residences and have been handed out to business owners, warning everybody of a plan that will involve temporary street closures and the elimination of curbside parking in some areas.\n\nStorefronts are being transformed and the plant life is exotic for Canada's climate, but the community is welcoming the production.\n\nCitizens and business owners alike have been asking if the palm trees can stay, said Gabrielle Rondy, executive director of the local merchants' association, Société de développement commercial du Village.\n\nThere has been a full street transformation, with some businesses even shutting down for a week so filming can be done inside, said Rondy.\n\n\"It's quite exciting,\" she said. \"It's changed the mood of the neighbourhood.\"\n\nFor the last two weeks, it's all everybody has been talking about, she said.\n\nThe Quebec Film and Television Council (QFTC) said in a statement that there was a slowdown in filming and production in the province following last year's writer and actor strike in the United States.\n\nThe QFTC has been working to attract more projects to the province, the statement says, and this year there are a few in the works.\n\nIn March 2024, the Quebec government announced new tax incentives and with that, the QFTC hopes to see more films and TV series in the province, the statement says.\n\nUntil then, passersby like Osama Shamala can enjoy a retrofitted Ste-Catherine Street. He said it has a \"real vacation vibe.\"\n\nStanding in front of a store made to look like an old Kodak camera shop, Christian Harris-Mungo said it's \"pretty remarkable, actually, how they have transformed Montreal into San Diego.\""
