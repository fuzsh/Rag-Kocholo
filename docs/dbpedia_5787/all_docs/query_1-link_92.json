        "text": "The death of Shelley Duvall, and some appearances by Nicole Kidman to promote the 25th anniversary of the unloved Eyes Wide Shut, have thrown a spotlight back onto Stanley Kubrick’s excruciating working methods. Many people in the media are oddly invested in defending his excesses as a perfectionist artistic process. But there is a much simpler way to interpret them.\n\nDavid Fincher is the only director working right now who is notorious for doing a hundred takes of a scene. But as Fincher does not set himself up as a recluse we know more about his methods. We have heard Ben Affleck, an accomplished director himself, say that Fincher warned him they were going to explore the script on a fractal level. We have heard Rooney Mara say that when he did ninety-nine takes of her intense scene with Jesse Eisenberg some of the takes had barely run ten seconds before he said cut, as he was trying to disorient the actors, to create a more jagged energy. We have also heard how Neil Patrick Harris had to park a car dead centre to please Fincher’s sense of three point symmetry, and nailed it on take three, to everyone’s surprise, and a delighted Fincher called that a wrap because it was perfect. We also have the extremely valuable behind the scenes footage of Mara and Fincher, and his long suffering cinematographer, trying to light a scene forwards and backwards for a computer controlled elaborate camera movement that Fincher wants to do. And the scene changes before our eyes. Mara has the injunction to make her face reflect that Lisbeth is ‘thinking evil sh-t’. But Fincher doesn’t love her outfit, so the costume is changed. The set is cold, and a space heater has been brought in. Fincher notices it is affecting the lighting, and then falls in love with the effect it creates, so integrates it into the scene. And so on… The scene changes, he is not simply doing a hundred takes without any instructions. Then we turn to the cast of The Shining, and Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Scatman Crothers in tears of frustration – lacking any instructions.\n\nYears ago for the University Observer I wrote a lengthy piece critiquing the over-praising of Kubrick. Critics would get hung up on a single image, and not see that was the problem – cinema is moving pictures. They were praising a former photographer for creating a memorable still frame. Whereas you should be thinking in sequences when praising great directors. You could defend Kubrick’s lack of instructions by looking to his photographer past. The photographer stands in the right place to frame the picture, and then takes many shots, hoping the elements he cannot control will come into the perfect mix if he waits long enough. But on a film set, you can control the elements – it’s literally your job. Even George Lucas, who was never going to be defended as a great director of actors, would tell his players his notorious two ‘directions’: ‘Faster’, ‘More intense’. Woody Allen is famously hands off with actors, regarding casting the right people and furnishing them with the script and some initial guidance most of the work needed. Christopher Nolan, according to Gary Oldman, only gave him one note over three Batman movies. Asking for another take, he told Oldman, ‘There’s more at stake here’. And that was it. But these directors who don’t get involved in epic discussions with their actors about motivations, don’t do a hundred takes without changing anything. Because what would be the point? If the point is to get hammy performances from actors, which seems code for coaxing deliberately bad acting from good actors, you could just ask them to “GO BIG!” Or hire bad actors, they’re not hard to find if you know where to look. Kubrick’s films have some of the worst acting you will ever see in a reputable filmography. And that’s after scores of takes.\n\nKubrick’s party line for his endless takes was that he was forced into it by the awfulness of actors, who never knew their lines. It’s become a rule of thumb for me over the last six years or so that if you have to start lying to make your case, then you have no case to make. There is, unfortunately for Kubrick, behind the scenes footage of a typical shooting day on The Shining. Shelley Duvall is getting her makeup done and trying to run her lines, Jack Nicholson is sitting at a table trying to run his lines off a suspiciously thin amount of script, and perched at the end of the table is Stanley Kubrick happily bashing away at a typewriter to produce the pages they are about to shoot in today’s version of the shooting script. Kubrick’s actors never knew their lines because Kubrick never locked their lines. That’s why Jack Nicholson eventually refused to learn any lines until he was in front of an imminently rolling camera because he’d got wise to Kubrick’s guff. So, why lie? It’s revealing, in that it attributes unprofessional lack of preparation to the actors, when actually the unprofessional lack of preparation is all on the director. If you were to see an entire crew standing idle, and actors rolling their eyes waiting for a shooting script of the scene slated for right now to be typed up, you would assume the director was totally incompetent. Clearly the director of Dr Strangelove is not totally incompetent. And so I suggest that all the unprofessional chaos going on in his sets, excused under the name of ‘perfectionism’, and burnished into legend by the media, could be better understood as the consistent reactions of a man battling an almost unbearable weight of insecurity.\n\nKubrick parted ways with his producer James B. Harris during pre-production of Dr Strangelove because he wanted to approach the material as a comedy and Harris wanted to approach it as a suspenseful drama. On his very next movie he discarded the entire score that Alex North had written for 2001: A Space Odyssey in order to curate classical music selections, some of them without seeking permission. And then when Anthony Burgess wrote a screenplay for A Clockwork Orange, he condemned it as simply the book in screenplay format. Kubrick then made the cast act out pages from the book while he filmed them, which is, of course, entirely different. He would later write up each day’s improvisations by the ensemble, passing it off as his adapted screenplay, something about which star Malcolm McDowell was not well pleased. There is a trend here, of a man increasingly desperate not to share any credit with anyone. Not only can he direct, he can produce, and he can write! There is something of Tarantino about the move away even from a composer, because Kubrick can now claim the credit for music he didn’t write by glorying in his very apposite choices. And, just like Once Upon A Time… in Hollywood being elongated because of pointless scenes there purely to showcase Tarantino’s obscurantist music choices from 1969, Kubrick’s insecurity would start to warp his work. Alfred Hitchcock didn’t mind people noticing the oomph Bernard Herrmann’s scores gave to his films. Christopher Nolan doesn’t feel slighted by the fact that Hans Zimmer is such a vital part of the success of Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk. But Kubrick had to let everyone know that he had curated the melding of photographs of many hotel interiors to create the Overlook. Roy Walker, back in your box.\n\nHollywood, the land of make-believe, has always walked a tightrope between reality and illusion. However, in recent years, the balance seems to have shifted dramatically.\n\nMy jaw dropped when I saw a YouTube video showcasing VFX work done on The Wolf of Wall Street. I would have thought that Martin Scorsese was more or less immune to the world of green screen, but no, here were imaginary locations stitched together or created wholesale out of CGI. I had much the same reaction towards the vaunted grittiness of Joker, when behind the scenes footage showed great swathes of CGI being painted on the cityscape in the background because it wasn’t gritty enough. Physical sets, meticulously crafted by production designers like Guy Hendrix Dyas, and even costumes, painstakingly imagined by costume designers like Kym Barrett, are facing an existential threat: the ubiquitous green screen. This raises a crucial question – is the capturing of physical reality becoming a relic of the past in filmmaking? The allure of green screen is apparently irresistible because of its supposed cheapness. (This depends on outrageous working conditions for VFX artists as has become widely known now) It allows for the creation of fantastical worlds, impossible locations, and dazzling visual effects. Blockbusters like Avatar and Inception wouldn’t exist without it. However, this reliance comes at a cost. The meticulously built sets, painstakingly researched by production designers, become relegated to concept art that is inexpertly realised by stressed software jockeys. The tangible textures, subtle interplay of light and shadow on a physical costume: these elements that add key depth and realism to a scene are sacrificed for the sterile “perfection” of the green screen.\n\nThis decline in the importance of physical sets puts the future of production designers in question. Their skillset – the ability to translate a script’s vision into a tangible space, to breathe life into a fictional world through physical construction; to create, as Alex McDowell did for Fight Club, a building that appears to be decaying from the inside out, even as the narrator’s psyche similarly implodes – may seem increasingly redundant. But before we write their obituary, let’s consider a new technology that this seachange has almost made obsolete before it even arrived: drone photography. Drones offer a unique opportunity to capture breathtaking cinematic landscapes. Smaller and more nimble (and safer) than helicopters, they can get remarkably close to actors and then soar with astonishing speed into wide vistas. Imagine soaring above a rugged mountain range, or weaving between towering skyscrapers, in a low budget production that could never dream of hiring a helicopter rig: drone footage can add a sense of epic scale and immersive sweep to any scene. Recently the TV show Catch Me a Killer utilised drone photography to great effect. Showcasing the varied landscapes of South Africa as Micki hunted serial killers in several provinces, it helped give a sense of the geography of crime scenes, as well as providing great emotional impact to her nervous arrival at a particularly intimidating new police headquarters. These are the two uses I first wrote about when the BBC started using drones in documentaries: explaining geography, and depicting emotional isolation.\n\nThis application of drone technology isn’t new. Shows like Supernatural and the second revival of The X-Files were using drones almost a decade ago to capture startling establishing shots, and provide a cinematic sweep to the simplest scenes of characters moving thru locations. Low budget feature films gratefully embraced them too. The enigmatic opening sequence of Don’t Breathe wouldn’t be the same without the drone’s unsettling slow descent through the dilapidated Detroit setting. So, why has drone cinematography seemingly stagnated in cinema since? The answer, much like the almost total abandonment of 3-D, lies in the extreme overreliance on green screen. When everything is shot on a green screen soundstage, there’s no physical location for a drone to showcase. The actors are adrift in a sea of pixels, and the vast landscapes they traverse are likely just as digitally generated as their weightless capes. (I’m looking at you, Doctor Strange) There’s a distinct difference between the visceral thrill of a drone soaring through a real canyon and the weightless, sterile feeling of a digitally created CGI simulation. Drone footage, when used judiciously, could ground the most fantastical story with a sense of physical reality. Just look at the difference between The Lord of the Rings, with its sweeping aerial photography locating its characters in rugged mountain landscapes hiding from a flock of Saruman’s scouting birds, and the overlit wall to wall CGI madness of The Hobbit’s escape in barrels down a river, leaving a thoroughly wasted potential tour de force.\n\nThe opening episodes of season 3 of SEAL Team set in Serbia set a new bar for action choreography with drone photography. But that was October 2019 and Covid prevented anyone really rising to its challenge for a while. Until Michael Bay, bored out of his mind during lockdown, decided to make one of his small personal movies, and went wild with drones. Ambulance can use drones because for the most part it is not shot on a green screen soundstage. At times Bay’s use of drones is vertigo-inducing as they dash across rooftops, start an establishing shot by falling down the side of a building and twisting about. (It also seems at times damn unsafe, as the drones shoot past actors in enclosed spaces at the speed of sound) But it is extremely telling that a man who loves to roll cars and blow stuff up is the one who rises to the challenge of using drone photography in cinema, because he can; because he is doing a lot of this stuff for real, in a physical location. The future of cinema must be about a return to reality. Green screen may allow for fantastical worlds, but without the foundation provided by physical sets or locations, those worlds feel hollow and derivative. A copy of a copy of a copy, so many swirling trash cans in the sky. Production designers are not digital set builders. Their irreplaceable skill set lies in crafting tangible worlds, imbued with texture and detail.\n\nCostume designers too have a vital role to play in creating physical garments that translate to the screen with a depth and authenticity that CGI simply cannot match. People have spoken of the magical moment when an actor puts on the cape for the first time and the set goes silent as people suddenly behold Superman in their midst. By contrast poor old Benedict Cumerbatch is walking around with the knowledge that a weightless cape will be hurriedly added in post-production because that’s a better idea than actually designing and manufacturing and fitting a real cape for him to work with as Doctor Strange. And Tom Holland has been playing Spider-Man without the benefit of actually being able to look down at his body and see a red costume with a black spider logo. Ultimately, the magic of cinema lies in its ability to transport us – to make us believe in worlds both real and imagined. The point of Hollywood trickery was to fool the eye. Now our eyes are not fooled, but we are taken for fools by an industry that insists this is good enough. Nope. By embracing physical artistry and real locations, film-makers can continue to create experiences that resonate on a deeper level. The future of Hollywood may involve pixels, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of capturing the physical world that has always been the wellspring of cinematic truth. Without a return to reality, cinema risks becoming a mere shadow of its former self.\n\nAs the title suggests, so forth.\n\n“We finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew it up!”\n\nWell now, my eyes see that the 2024 Oscar for Best Picture went to Oppenheimer. I am surprised. I really did think they would find a way to give it to Poor Things instead. Clearly they were itching to; with Poor Things getting 4 Oscars and Oppenheimer getting 7 Oscars. Because this really does represent the Academy dynamiting everything they’ve been doing for two decades. It’s been widely noted that Oppenheimer is the most popular film at the box office to triumph since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2004. As opposed to say, Poor Things, the 104th most popular film of 2023 at the North American Box Office. By a startling coincidence the ratings for this Oscar ceremony were the highest since 2020. Hmmm. It’s almost, now follow me closely here, as if people watch the ceremony only if they’ve seen some of the films that got nominated. Now, if you were to repeat this trick next year, and create, say, a trend, like in the 1990s, where the Best Picture Oscar repeatedly goes to popular movies, you might get back to a floor of over 20 million viewers, because people might start tuning back in when they no longer feel they’re going to be baited and switched every damn year. For the record the Best Picture winners of this decade; Parasite, Nomadland, CODA, Everything Everywhere All at Once; made a combined 134 million at the North American Box Office. Oppenheimer made 329 million. And that is how you actually get viewers.\n\n“I am not a number, I am an Oscar winner!”\n\nThere seems to be an increasing amount of chatter that Christopher Nolan is going to follow up Oppenheimer with a film version of Patrick McGoohan’s mind-bending 1960s TV show The Prisoner. There is actually some fire behind the smoke here. Nolan famously doesn’t write screenplays anymore unless he’s sure he can get them made, after being badly burned when his already scripted Howard Hughes biopic starring Jim Carrey got cancelled after Scorsese’s bloated The Aviator beat him into production. The major project thereafter from which he reputedly walked away was a film version of The Prisoner. There it seemed the well was poisoned by the ill-conceived Ian McKellen/Jim Caviezel TV reboot of 2009 going ahead (and sullying the brand). But, Universal own the film rights to The Prisoner, and Nolan made Oppenheimer at Universal. So, perhaps he now has the inclination to write something which he knows he can definitely get made. And it is definitely very much within his zone. After all, the ‘A, B, and C’ episode of The Prisoner in which Number Two creates dream scenarios for Number Six in an attempt to get him to confess clearly must have been an influence on Inception. The Prisoner is about intrusive surveillance (The Dark Knight), a man of iron will and integrity resisting a corrupt establishment (Batman Begins), and any number of trippy conceits that distort the nature of reality (Tenet). Also we never learn Number Six’s real name, he’s just The Protagonist… And dear uncle John Nolan had a cameo appearance in the original series. He’d make a good Number Two.\n\nAs the title suggests, so forth.\n\nSome people are never happy\n\nI remember vividly some people moaning about Inception, claiming that because it didn’t have lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex it was totally invalid as an exploration of dreams. The film that should have made oodles of money rather than Inception, in the eyes of these latter-day Freudians, was Vanishing Waves a couple of years later, which had lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex. But are all dreams about running naked in sand dunes at night, chasing someone else who’s naked, and sometimes being chased by them, and never quite catching up or being caught up to? Or are all dreams about meeting someone for the first time and having naked sex in an empty sun-drenched room? Surely there are other kinds of dreams… And Christopher Nolan has a perfect right to explore those other kinds of dreams. Fast forward to this summer, Nolan surprises everyone with an R rating for Oppenheimer. His first since Insomnia in 2002. The reason? Lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex, particularly striking in his depiction of Oppenheimer’s reveries. And these people … moan about him not showing The Bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And also moan about him not devoting a subplot to the clearance of Native Americans from the Los Alamos site. You cannot win. If complaining is both a valid method and a criteria for criticism then, pffft. Somebody will always have something to complain about, regarding anything and everything. This is why Leonard Bernstein’s children decided to tell these people to STFU about how “problematic” it was for Bradley Cooper to don a prosthetic nose to play him in Maestro. Much like Nicole Kidman did to Oscar-winning effect in The Hours when playing Virginia Woolf. Bernstein’s children were happy for Cooper to don the nose and felt “any strident complaints around this issue” were perhaps “disingenuous attempts to bring a successful person down a notch — a practice we observed all too often perpetrated on our own father.” Given that this chorus of complaining had started months before anybody had even seen the film it was a very necessary and deserved strike, and seems to have had the desired effect. People are curious to see what writer/director/star Bradley Cooper is going to do with the life of an American titan. As they should be. And instead of obsessing over Nolan’s problematic treatment of whatever, perhaps the moaners should appreciate what he actually did – the father of The Bomb hears the news of Hiroshima on the radio like everyone else, because once the science is done, he is not needed by the powers that be anymore, and his brainchild is taken away.\n\nWarners, get your Gunn\n\nThis is the way the Snyderverse ends, not with a bang but a whimper. Why did The Flash, Blue Beetle and (it looks likely) Aquaman 2 all bomb? There are various reasons, (comically bad CGI, notorious actors, calling Batman a fascist…) but I’m fairly sure James Gunn publicly canning the entire DCEU before any of these films had even been released sure helped. Was he, in his new role as guardian of the DC flame for Warner Bros, seriously unaware of the doom loop noted on Netflix whereby cancelling shows without a resolution makes people hesitant to commit to new shows? People afraid to commit to new shows lest they also go nowhere leads to poor ratings because of this hesitancy which leads to those shows then being cancelled, proving the hesitaters right, so that more people join their ranks next time, and so on and so on in an unstoppable Kessler syndrome. Again, it is worth noting the power law that applies to American cinema. You could lose 47% of your box office takings by alienating just 11% of cinemagoers. And those cinemagoers are probably the ones who are extremely online; hyper aware that Gunn had cancelled Wonder Woman 3 with Gal Gadot, and prevented Henry Cavill returning as Superman, while simultaneously committing to his wife Jennifer Holland’s much loved (cough) Harcourt character continuing on into the new DCU. Alienate this group at your peril…\n\nLast Orders in Soho\n\nIt now seems likely that Last Night in Soho was not just the swansong of the late Diana Rigg but also the final film of her fellow 1960s icon Terence Stamp. Which is a terrible disappointment, because director Edgar Wright shamefully wasted both of their talents on his misguided time-travel horror. I was excited to see this movie before Covid scuppered its September 2020 release, but when I finally caught up with it on Netflix in the company of The Engineer, a fellow devotee of The Avengers, it was a huge let down. For all the world it seemed like Wright had gone down the same rabbit hole as Tarantino had just before him when curating movies for Sony Movies Classics – assuming everyone has seen as many obscure 1960s films as he has. Wright, from interviews, seems to believe he was interrogating the attitudes of 1960s films that were beloved and problematic. Actually he’s preaching about God knows what in films that nobody’s seen in sixty years, and then wondering why we aren’t responding to his homily in the way he expected. The obscurantist imperative strikes again. I mean what is the point of making a film in 2020 to castigate the 1960s? Won’t someone else make a film in 2080 to castigate the 2020s? For heaven’s sake even now there is plenty to castigate in Wright’s muddled movie. The level of unapologetic misandry on display takes the breath away. To complain about prostitution dehumanising women, Wright, without irony, puts a blurred facemask on all of the clients to dehumanise them. Before blithely endorsing the villain’s justification for murdering them all and hiding their bodies for sixty years, because they deserved it for paying a prostitute for sex. Uh, okay. A late revelation about a character not being evil after all is undermined by him being nicknamed ‘Handsy’, so he cannot be redeemed. And the barman who gave him that nickname, instead of confronting him over his behaviour, is also not good because he is therefore complicit in the power structures of (cough) “toxic masculinity”. There is only one male character in the entire movie who is portrayed at all positively, and he is a manic pixie dream boy so painfully lacking in any level of believability that he barely makes it to being one-dimensional. With all this intrusive lecturing and terrible writing (and thinking) it is little surprise that, almost from the off, I noticed that this film was entirely lacking in the directorial vim one expects from Edgar Wright. My jaw dropped when I saw how he depicted Thomasin McKenzie arriving in London. Tony Zhou once made an entire video essay about how Wright was so much more visually interesting than the boring movie cliches of establishing that we are arriving in a new location. He used to be…\n\nI thought the Machine lacked specificity. Sorry, I meant ChatGPT. It wishes it was as smart as Harold Finch’s all-seeing Machine from Person of Interest.\n\nIt first off made the customary apologies and excuses for personal taste being a factor, glossing over the fact that an AI has no personal taste. It is an empty formula of words, or a get out of jail free clause, drawing attention to the fact that it is an AI to excuse poor performance. Jokes are somewhat beyond the capacity of an AI so it does not attempt any. But being specific is also hard; because a large language model doesn’t truly understand what it is saying, it is simply spitting out sentences like bam bam bam according to the probability that one block following the other block will sit together in a pile of blocks that looks similar to a pile of language blocks that it has digested from existing written material as making sense to us humans.\n\nChatGPT will not attempt jokes by itself but you can force it to write them by request. But they will not be very good. They will resemble the theoretical jokes I produced once at a vulnerable moment in my youth. The Engineer noted ChatGPT’s ability to crank out a hundred jokes in a few seconds as being impressive compared to how long a human would take. Well, yes and no. Simon Rich said in an interview once that he wrote good comic material by writing a lot of comic material and throwing away all but the best. Seth Meyers does hilarious surprise inspections of his writers, showing them, in his estimation, cranking out ten jokes to make their assignment, and hoping to God just one is good enough to make it into the opening monologue. ChatGPT’s jokes aren’t monologue material.\n\nSpecificity. What do you think of when you hear that word? I am instantly in a warehouse with Tom Hardy and JGL snarking each other about their approach to the delicate work of inception. ChatGPT’s article ranking the various actors as Bond very noticeably lacked specific examples. When I think of Connery as marksman, offhand, I see him taking quick pop shots at goons in either direction to get them firing at each other in Thunderball, or quietly and savagely telling the villainous quisling in Dr No that he’s had his six and then shooting him repeatedly at point blank range. ChatGPT writes like, and indeed is, someone (sic) who’s never seen a Bond film but has heard people talk about them, and so tries bluffing their way using all the right buzzwords – hoping to God nobody asks for examples.\n\nAnd yet, here’s my fear, if AI is indeed coming for all our jobs – and some sooner rather than later – can I easily outwrite ChatGPT, and does it even matter?\n\nChristopher Nolan’s much anticipated new film is an intricate and satisfying puzzle piece housed in a less satisfying blockbuster frame.\n\nJohn David Washington is the protagonist who has a mysterious close shave with a bullet that seems to whip out of woodwork and away from him during a terrorist siege of the Kiev Opera House. Shortly thereafter Martin Donovan informs him that he has been recruited for an international mission involving Robert Pattinson’s British agent that will take them from Mumbai to London, Oslo to Tallin, and deep into the cold heart of Siberia trying to unravel the secrets of Kenneth Branagh’s vicious Russian oligarch arms dealer. An uneasy alliance forms with Branagh’s estranged wife Elizabeth Debicki, as Washington and Pattinson try to understand why an arms dealer is able to anticipate all their moves as if he already knew them, and why ‘inverted’ bullets may be the least of their worries as a wider more sinister conspiracy unfurls itself.\n\nAnd so to ‘inversion’… Time travel, but not really time travel. If you liked cult Ethan Hawke flick Predestination then you will like this. If talk of closed loops, grandfather paradoxes, and the like makes your nose bleed then you will not like this. Nolan’s script features the same deeply satisfying feeling as Interstellar and Dunkirk when a piece of the puzzle slots into place and you understand that there was more going on than you apprehended first time around. But this satisfying feeling is surrounded by the scaffolding of a blockbuster that doesn’t truly stand tall when the scaffolding is kicked away. Crashing a large airplane into a building for real is great fun to watch, and the chase with cars driving inversely on a freeway is also entertaining, but there is no true knockout punch of a sequence.\n\nSome of this is because this is less fun than Inception, almost as if Tom Hardy and JGL’s roles had been collapsed into one and Robert Pattinson (rediscovering his inner Cedric Diggory) couldn’t possibly deliver both those notes at once. Some of it is because this has less heart than Interstellar, with the Debicki/Branagh dynamic not humming as it ideally should as the emotional motor of the movie. Nolan regulars Hoyte van Hoytema and Nathan Crowley are present and correct but the largely Northern European settings are neither as crisply shot as one might expect nor as intriguingly designed; indeed the finale recalls the crumbling Russian industrial hellscape from Hobbs & Shaw. Jeffrey Kurland provides some notably sharp suits and elegant dresses for the ensemble, but Hans Zimmer’s replacement Ludwig Goransson struggles to impose himself with any truly memorable motifs.\n\nTenet does not reach the hoped for heights, but it is devilishly clever and always absorbing; one wonders if perhaps making it on a smaller scale, more noirish, less blockbusting, might have been wiser.\n\n3.5/5\n\nChristopher Nolan follows his longest film with his shortest since his 1998 debut Following, with which it shares a tricky approach to time and story.\n\nFrance is sucker-punched and on its way to falling. The British Expeditionary Force is leaving it to its fate and retreating through the only open port, Dunkirk, that England might still have an army with which to fight on. On the Mole Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D’Arcy) spend a week organising the evacuation of soldiers, with the difficulty of a shallow beach and one quay making a perfect target for Stuka dive-bombers. On a Little Ship Dawson (Mark Rylance) pilots his way across the Channel over a long day, with son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and stowaway George (Barry Keoghan). On a ticking clock of one hour’s fuel RAF aces Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden) attempt to fend off some of the Lutwaffe’s endless attacks on the beach and convoys. Their stories intersect tensely, complexly.\n\nNolan hasn’t made as abstract a film as this since Following. To a large degree the presence of some Nolan repertory and a host of familiar faces lends a degree of depth to the characterisation not perhaps there simply in the spare scripting. And it is spare. The majority of screen time belongs to Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), who meet on the desolate beach, and try to stay alive thru repeated attacks, and the dubious comradeship of Alex (Harry Styles). And for the majority of their screen time, they are silent. But the film is not. Viewed in IMAX this is absolutely deafening, with Hans Zimmer’s score interrogating the line with sound design as it throws anachronistic synth blasts amidst the ticking pocket-watch effect, and, startlingly, quotes Elgar’s ‘Nimrod’ Variation at high points of tension and release.\n\nOn his second collaboration with Hoyte Van Hoytema it’s still unclear whether he and Nolan are less interested in the shadows and earth tones of Wally Pfister’s palate or simply have lucked into two stories that required large swathes of white and blue. One thing that looks unique is the aerial dogfights, IMAX cameras attached to Spitfires these have a dizzying sense of reality: this is a pilot’s eye-view of combat and it’s madly disorienting. And, as the inevitability of Hardy’s choice to not return from France approaches, symptomatic of this film’s remarkable sense of dread. You can no more criticise Nolan for not following the Blake Snyder beats than you could attack Jackson Pollock for failing at figurative art. He can do that supremely well, he’s choosing not to. And making you look, follow, and feel without using words.\n\nAnd, without using any words, Nolan plays a game with time that makes Dunkirk a film that will amply repay repeat viewings. As the timelines intersect you realise that events that looked simple are a lot more complicated, sometimes even the reverse of what you thought you’d understood. And the same is true for characterisation. At times it feels like Nolan is answering the tiresome critics who attacked Inception and Interstellar for having too much exposition, even as they complained they couldn’t understand them – for all the explanations. And, if those critics insist on taking the ridiculous Billington on Stoppard line of Nolan being all head and no heart, he has the ultimate conjuring trick; Nolan makes us care, with our guts in knots, for people whose names we’re not even sure about, let alone their back-story and motivations.\n\nNolan has taken a touchstone of British culture and produced a film with a lean running time but a Lean epic quality by viewing the world-changing through the personal.\n\n5/5\n\nPrevious milestones on this blog have been marked by features on Michael Fassbender and a vainglorious, if requested, list (plays to see before you die). But as today marks exactly six years since Talking Movies kicked off in earnest on Tuesday September 1st 2009 with a review of (500) Days of Summer I’ve rummaged thru the archives for some lists covering the various aspects of the blog’s expanded cultural brief.\n\nTop 6 Films\n\nThere’s been a lot of films given a write-up and a star rating hereabouts.

the blog than I would have liked, but I’ve greatly enjoyed the occasional adventures of Hollywood insider Micawber-Mycroft; a homage to PG Wodehouse’s Mr Mulliner.\n\nHere are my favourite colour pieces from the last six years:\n\nHow to Watch 300\n\nMark Pellegrino gets ambitious\n\nGreat Production Disasters of Our Time: Apocalypse Now\n\nMicawber-Mycroft explains nervous action directing\n\nAlfred & Bane: Brothers in Arms\n\nKristen Bell, Book and Candle\n\nSix years, my brain hurts a lot…\n\nChristopher Nolan redeems himself after the patchy The Dark Knight Rises with a hard tack into heavy-duty theoretical sci-fi in a mind-bending, oddly abstract blockbuster.\n\nThe McConaissance continues as Matthew McConaughey takes on the role of Cooper, a Texan engineer and pilot turned farmer in the near future. Cooper’s is a self-professed caretaker generation, trying to eke a subsistence living from a devastated planet with a collapsed population. Indeed Cooper’s daughter Murph is subjected to some Orwellian education about the futility of technological civilisation. But among the cornfields stalked by blight and storming dust-clouds there are still some people who dream big: NASA in hiding. Michael Caine’s wise professor and his icy daughter Brand (Anne Hathaway) convince Cooper to pilot their last ditch Lazarus mission, to travel through a wormhole next to Saturn in an attempt to find a new home for humanity. But as Cooper leaves an inconsolable Murph behind him, and joins fellow astronauts Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi), he finds that the search for humanity’s salvation seems oddly underpinned by losing all traces of humanity…\n\nInterstellar is a bold change of pace for the Brothers Nolan. The script, written by Jonathan Nolan and then reworked by Christopher, sketches in this future world in the manner of a John Wyndham novel; taking for granted that we know about the macro which we actually only learn about when it impacts the micro world of Cooper and Murph. This leads to some double-take moments, such as Bill Irwin’s comic relief, which are amplified by Nolan’s insistence on secrecy. Some familiar faces appear to shocking effect, which would be dissipated by mentioning them; but among them is a cheerful cameo from William Devane aka 24’s President Heller. Interstellar could best be described as a version of Sunshine written not by Alex Garland, but instead boasting a screenplay by Rod Serling based on a story outline by Carl Sagan. Hard science of a theoretical bent mixes with a soured vision of humanity’s worst tendencies being dominant.\n\nInterstellar is unlikely to get as fond a welcome as previous Nolan movies, but it does have much in common with them; from the Twilight Zone finale like The Prestige, to simultaneous set-pieces as adult Murph (Jessica Chastain) and Cooper wrestle with similar dilemmas like Inception. Hans Zimmer’s score avoids nearing Richard Strauss’ template by borrowing Arcade Fire’s Neon Bible organ and plugging it into a million IMAX amplifiers; achieving solemnity (without melody) by dint of volume. The replacement of Wally Pfister as DP by Hoyte van Hoytema doesn’t jar, but the changeover is aided by the fact that a very different cinematic world is being captured than that of the Nolan/Pfister paradigm. Nolan wrings good performances from his large cast, with Mackenzie Foy blowing Jessica Chastain off the screen as the younger iteration of the indomitable Murph, and McConaughey counteracting the heartless science of the Brand family with the emotional sensitivity of the Coopers.\n\nInterstellar walks a tricky high-wire, attempting to create a heart-rending family saga dependent for its emotion on theoretical physics being literalised in a way that defeats traditional blockbuster visuals.\n\n4/5"
