        "text": "Wonka takes viewers to a city that feels familiar. In reality, the new movie starring Timothée Chalamet is set in a fictional town that was designed with a blend of European influence. The charming location came to life through more than 50 sets built on soundstages, a backlot, and even an aircraft hanger (more on that below!). A small selection of real filming locations—from an English palace with 1930s Art Deco interiors to an iconic church in London—tied it all together. If you’re eager to learn more, take a look at everything we know about the filming locations and setting below.\n\nWhere Was Wonka Filmed?\n\nA majority of filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, where other beloved productions like Barbie and the Harry Potter franchise were filmed. Director Paul King described the fairytale city he wanted to create as “the best of Europe,” according to a press brief. The resulting romantic town features a mix of Belgian, Czech, Dutch, French, German, and Swiss architecture. The production team mapped out the entire island city to include a ruined castle at the top, a town square in the middle with a cathedral across from the Galeries Gourmet—a shopping center inspired by the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan—docks, alleyways that lead to Mrs. Scrubitt’s workhouse laundry, and a network of underground drains. For a deeper look at the sets, we have you covered with all of the can't-miss design details in Wonka.\n\nWhat Real Filming Locations Are Featured in Wonka?\n\nA few filming locations in and around England bring the fictional town to life. Better yet, fans can visit most of them—from a lavish ballroom to a seaside town where one of famed author Jane Austen's novels is partially set.\n\nRivoli Ballroom in London, England\n\nRivoli Ballroom is the only 1950s ballroom in London that remains intact. Listed as a National Heritage building, the famed venue first opened as a cinema in 1913. Since then, it's received minor alterations and an Art Deco interior refresh in the ‘50s. The venue is known for its barrel-vaulted auditorium and original design elements including flock wallpaper, chandeliers, big lanterns, and red velvet accents. Today, Rivoli Ballroom hosts dance-centric events and cinema nights. It was tapped to depict a comedy club in Wonka and has been used as a filming location for productions including The Avengers and The Muppets.\n\nEltham Palace in London, England\n\nThe Slugworth house and factory interiors are portrayed by . Once a medieval palace and then a Tudor royal residence, the 1930s structure was revamped by millionaires Stephen and Virginia Courtauld. The Art Deco mansion mixed with Swedish design has fun, unconventional features including a map room, where the couple planned their world travels, and a luxe bathroom with a golden mosaic niche. There are also 19 acres of gardens to explore on the property.\n\nSt. Paul's Cathedral in London, England\n\nThe interiors of the town square cathedral were shot at the iconic St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Rare permission was given for the production to open the Great West Door of the historic church, which is typically used only for special services.\n\nBath, England\n\nThe English city of Bath boasts honey-colored Georgian architecture that blends nicely with the studio backlot build, making it ideal for exterior shots by the cathedral, colonnade, and riverbank. The city is known for and named after its Roman-built baths and is certainly worth exploring.\n\nOxford, England\n\nA special moment in Wonka takes place outside of Radcliffe Camera, which is part of the University of Oxford’s library. The landmark building is linked by an underground tunnel to the university’s Bodleian Old Library, which is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. Guided tours are available for anyone who wants to see the remarkable locations.\n\nGoring Gap, Sutton Bridge, and Mapledurham\n\nThe memories of Wonka’s upbringing were filmed at Goring Gap, a narrow valley in the British Isles; Sutton Bridge, a pretty stretch of the Thames River that boasts weeping willows and a stone bridge; and around Mapledurham, a small English village.\n\nThe Cobb in Lyme Regis, England\n\nThe historic harbor known as The Cobb was tapped to portray the docks in the fictional city in Wonka. Located in the English town of Lyme Regis, which is made up of well-preserved period buildings, The Cobb is a busy working port for small fishing businesses. Originally, it was built as a breakwater to protect ships and the town. The seaside destination is packed with fun things to do, from visiting the small marine aquarium to taking a guided fossil walk. Bonus: The town is where Jane Austen’s novel Persuasion is partially set.\n\nCardington Airfield in Bedfordshire, England\n\nThe flying scenes with Chalamet and actress Calah Lane, who plays Noodle, were filmed at an aircraft hangar on Cardington Airfield, a former Royal Air Force station in Bedfordshire, England. Many productions have tapped the facilities to film extravagant stunts and choreography including The Dark Knight, Inception, and Dumbo.\n\nYou love filming locations. So do we. Let’s obsess over them together."
