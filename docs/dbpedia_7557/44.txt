Masséna distinguished himself during the War of the First Coalition, being a vital commander in many of the significant French victories and was at the helm of the French advance into Austrian territory, compelling them to open peace negotiations.[4]

Although many of Napoleon's generals were trained at the finest French and European military academies, Masséna was among those who achieved greatness without the benefit of formal education. While those of noble rank acquired their education and promotions as a matter of privilege, Masséna rose from humble origins to such prominence that Napoleon referred to him as "the greatest name of my military empire".[2]

In addition to his battlefield successes, Masséna's leadership aided the careers of many. A majority of the French marshals of the time served under his command at some point.[6]
