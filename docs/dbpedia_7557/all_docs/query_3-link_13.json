Originally named the Army of Observation, it was expanded with elements of the Army of Mainz (Mayence) and the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland). The army had three divisions plus an advance guard, a reserve, and an artillery park.[2] The artillery park was under the command of Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière and consisted of 33 cannons and 19 howitzers operated by 1,329 non-commissioned officers and cannoneers as well as 60 officers. There were approximately 25,000 members of the Army, the role of which was to invade southwestern Germany, precipitating the War of the Second Coalition.\n\nThe Army crossed the Rhine River on 1 March 1799 under the command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, in the order of battle below. As elements crossed the Rhine, they took the name \"Army of the Danube\". The crossing was completed by 7 March.[2] After passing through the Black Forest, the Army fought two battles in quick succession, the Battle of Ostrach, on 20–21 March, and Stockach, on 25–26 March. It suffered badly in both engagements and, following the action at Stockach, withdrew to the Black Forest. Jourdan established his headquarters at Hornberg, and the Reserve cavalry and the cavalry of the Advance Guard quartered near Offenburg, where the horses could find better forage.[3]\n\nInitially, the Army included six future Marshals of France: its commander-in-chief, Jourdan; François Joseph Lefebvre; Jean-Baptiste Drouet; Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr; Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor; and Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier.[4] After the defeat at Ostrach, the Army was reorganized and command shifted to another future marshal, André Masséna.[5] Under Masséna's command, elements of the army participated in skirmishes in Switzerland, the eleven-hour Battle of Winterthur and the First and Second Battles of Zürich.[6] The Army was disbanded in November 1799 and its units dispersed among other French field armies by mid-December.[1]\n\nStaff\n\n[edit]\n\nJean-Baptiste Jourdan received command of the Army of Observation in September 1798, from its temporary commander, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino. From October to December, he assessed its condition. By 27 February 1799 Moreau had drawn together his general staff and laid out his operational plan for a Danube campaign.[7]\n\nGeneral Staff\n\n[edit]\n\nChief of Staff Jean Augustin Ernouf Position Staff Commander of the Engineers Armand Samuel de Marescot Chief Commissary Jean Baptiste Vaillant[8] Commander of the Artillery Jean Fabre de La Martillière\n\nAndré Joseph Lemaire Staff officer Joseph Augustin Fournier, Marquis d'Aultanne[9] Adjutants Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor\n\nÉtienne Hastrel de Rivedoux\n\nJean-François Barbier\n\nFrançois Louis Dedon-Duclos Source: Jean-Baptiste Jourdan.

François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had appointed General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, this was the best Jourdan could do for him. Vandamme led the Advance Guard through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command.[10] Within a week, part of the advance guard broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.[11]\n\nAdvance Guard\n\nGeneral of Division François Joseph Lefebvre\n\nAdjutants: Jean-Baptiste Drouet and François-Xavier Octavie Fontaine.\n\nGeneral of Brigade Jean-de-Dieu Soult Column Commander Units Notes Left General of Brigade Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier\n\n25th Regiment of Light Infantry (Légère) (two battalions)[12]\n\n53rd Demi-brigade (two battalions)\n\n67th Demi-brigade (two battalions)\n\nThe 53rd and 67th Demi-brigades had formed part of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse 1795–1797.[13] Right General of Division Dominique Louis Antoine Klein\n\n4th Hussars\n\n5th Hussars\n\n1st Light Horse (Chasseurs à Cheval)\n\n17th Dragoons\n\n3rd Horse Artillery (1st and 27th Company)\n\n1st Foot Artillery (1st and 6th Company)\n\n3rd Battalion Sappers (7th Company)\n\nMost of these units had served in the old Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse.[14] Detached Flank General of Division Dominique Vandamme\n\n1st Regiment (Infantry) (two battalions) (Detached from III.

Division)\n\nAlthough Vandamme commanded the I. Division in the absence of Lefebvre, after Lefebvre's return, assumed first, a staff position, and then Jourdan assigned him to investigate rumors of an Austrian presence in Stuttgart.[11] These units became the flanking corps (corps de flanqueurs); one unit was taken from Saint-Cyr's division and the other, 8th of the Line, from d'Hautpoul's reserve. This amounted to approximately 3,000 troops, which weakened both the Reserve and the III. Division.[15]\n\nVandamme's flanking force including a squadron of dragoons and a squadron of light horse, but it is unclear which ones: A squadron of the 1st Dragoons may have been detached from II. Division, or a squadron of the 2nd Dragoons from the left column of the III. Division. In addition, his force included a squadron of Light Horse, from either the 8th or 10th, detached from the III. Division, were engaged.[16]\n\nStrength of Advance Guard: 6,292 infantry; 2,102 cavalry; 382 artillery; and 177 sappers.[17] Sources: Unless otherwise cited, Roland Kessinger and Geert van Uythoven.

Division\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen near Basel, Switzerland, and marched in two columns eastward. The right column, commanded by Jean Victor Tharreau, moved along the northern shoreline of the Rhine. The left column, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jacopin, moved at the northernmost rim of the river valley. From Switzerland, Masséna sent a Demi-brigade of the Army of Helvetia to secure Schaffhausen, part of the Swiss cantons that lie north of the Rhine river. In holding Schaffhausen, Masséna insured the passage of Ferino's forward units.[18] Ferino's orders were to proceed from Schaffhausen along the north shore of Lake Constance, also called the Bodensee. His left flank was to remain in contact with the II. Division, to prevent the Austrians from piercing the army's forward line. His advance units were to proceed as far as the Imperial Abbey of Salem. From there, he was instructed to prevent any Austrian reinforcements from Switzerland joining with Archduke Charles, whom Jourdan expected to move across the Iller river near Augsburg, and advance into Swabia.[19]\n\nI.

Division was 6,452 infantry; 988 cavalry; 481 artillery; and 192 sappers.[23] Sources: Unless otherwise cited, Roland Kessinger and Geert van Uythoven. Order of Battle, Army of the Danube. Stockach: Roland Kessinger & Geert van Uythoven. Accessed 14 April 2010.\n\nII. Division\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division followed the Advance Guard across the Rhine, also at Kehl. As it approached the mountains, II. Division followed the river valleys east of Freudenstadt.[24] At the Battle of Ostrach, II. Division took position behind François Joseph Lefebvre's Advance Guard, on the slope below Pfullendorf. At the Battle of Stockach, Souham's Division, positioned in the center, was to coordinate a simultaneous assault with Ferino's I. Division on the Austrian left flank.[25]\n\nII.

Their Chef de Brigade Jean-Baptiste-Theodore Vialanes was wounded in southwestern Germany in 1800; he eventually was promoted to brigadier general in 1803 and raised to baron of the Empire in 1808.[26] Jacques LeBaron was Chef de Brigade of the 6th Dragoons; he was killed on 6 February 1807 at the Battle of Eylau.[27] Right General of Brigade Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen\n\n2nd Demi-brigade (two battalions)\n\n7th Demi-brigade (two battalions)\n\n1st Dragoons (two squadrons)\n\n7th Horse Artillery (3rd Company)\n\n2nd Foot Artillery (15th Company)\n\n7th Foot Artillery (13th Company)\n\n3rd Battalion Sappers (1st Company)\n\nFrancois-Alexis Guyonneau de Pambour (1766–1802) was appointed Chef-de-Brigade of the 7th Horse Artillery on 26 March 1799; the previous Chef Nicolas-Louis Gueriot de Saint-Martin had been promoted to brigadier general in February of that year. The regiment was disbanded in 1801. The 2nd Foot Artillery took battle honors at the Second Battle of Zürich in September 1799.[28] Strength: 5,630 infantry; 847 cavalry; 316 artillery; and 161 sappers.[29] Sources: Unless otherwise cited, Roland Kessinger and Geert van Uythoven.

Division\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery park, via the valleys at Freiburg im Breisgau, where the horses would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.[24] At the Battle of Ostrach, after more than 15 hours of general engagement, the Austrians flanked the III. Division's left wing and pressed the entire division back to the Pfullendorf heights.[30] At the Battle of Stockach, Saint-Cyr and Vandamme were to execute simultaneous attacks on the Austrian right flank, Saint-Cyr on the front and Vandamme from the rear; the attacks failed when Archduke Charles moved support troops from the left flank.[31]\n\nIII.

Accessed 14 April 2010.\n\nReserve\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Reserve crossed the river at Kehl, swung south toward Freiburg im Breisgau, and crossed the mountains at Neustadt, to Loffingen, Bruhlingen and Hüfingen.[24] At the Battle of Ostrach, the Reserve remained in the northern outskirts of Pfullendorf and did not participate in the battle except in small groups. When Jourdan decided to withdraw, d'Hautpoul's cavalry moved to the west first, to secure bridges and the east–west roads.[35] At the battle of Stockach, the Reserve was slow to support of Ferino's I. Division, which had run out of ammunition; when a cavalry charged failed to materialize, the Austrians acquired the upper hand.[36] Jourdan later charged d'Hautpoul with dereliction.[37] After the Stockach engagement, most of the Reserve withdrew to the west side of the Black Forest, where the horses could find forage,[24] but by late April, the Reserve had joined with the André Masséna's Army of Helvetia outside of Zürich; d'Hautpoul joined them in July after he was cleared by a Courts-martial in Strasbourg.[37]\n\nReserve\n\nGeneral of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul Commander(s) Units Notes Louis Fursy Henri Compere[38]\n\nChristophe Ossvald[19]\n\nFrançois Léon Ormancey\n\nJean Christophe Collin[19]\n\n1st Mounted Carabiniers Regiment\n\n2nd Mounted Carabiniers Regiment\n\n4th Cavalry Regiment\n\n6th Cavalry Regiment\n\n7th Cavalry Regiment\n\n8th Cavalry Regiment\n\n23rd Cavalry Regiment\n\n25th Cavalry Regiment\n\n6th Horse Artillery (5th Company)\n\n7th Horse Artillery (2nd Company)\n\n3rd Foot Artillery (2nd and 3rd Company)\n\n3rd Battalion Sappers\n\nAntoine Christophe was chef-de-brigade (colonel) of the 1st Regiment; Armand-Augustine-Louis De Caulaincourt was appointed chef-de-brigade of the 2nd Regiment on 30 July 1799; he was wounded on 2 November 1799.
