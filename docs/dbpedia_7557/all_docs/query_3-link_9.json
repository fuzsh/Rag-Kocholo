        "text": "This week’s #MarshalMonday is a man who is rated by the vast majority of Napoleonic historians as one of Napoleon’s finest commanders. Indeed, Napoleon himself called him: “the greatest name of my military Empire.” This week, I’m taking a look at André Masséna; Duke of Rivoli and Prince of Essling.\n\nMasséna was of humble origins; born to a shopkeeper in Nice in 1758 (technically making him Sardinian rather than French). His father died when he was six and at age thirteen the young André ran off to sea as a cabin boy. He would serve in the Mediterranean and Atlantic for the next four years. When he returned home, he then enlisted in the Royal Italian Regiment and was quickly raised to sergeant. However, in the pre-revolutionary era, a man of lowly birth could not go any further than Warrant Officer and so Masséna left the army in 1789.\n\nHe moved to Antibes, married Anne Marie Lamare and allegedly ran a successful smuggling operation (he was certainly never caught!) before the Revolution changed everything. He enlisted in the local National Guard. In 1791, he joined the Volunteers of Var and was elected colonel within a single year. His battalion would go on to become part of the Army of Italy.\n\nBy the closing days of the Revolution, Masséna was a général de division. In 1795, he was commanding the right wing of the Army of Italy, having served in every major development of the campaign there, and he hoped to be Schérer’s replacement for overall command. Instead however, a young General Bonaparte arrived on the scene to take charge.\n\nMasséna, Serurier and Augereau were initially inclined to look down upon this upstart, until it became very clear that they were now subordinate to a military mind of no common merit. Masséna in turn thoroughly impressed his new general at Lodi, Lonato, Castiglione, Arcola and Rivoli.\n\nFollowing his role in the surrender of the 30,000 man garrison at Mantua, Napoleon nicknamed Masséna the ‘dear child of victory’. As First Consul, he quickly made the future marshal Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Italy. In 1804, upon the creation of the Empire, Masséna was then elevated to Marshal and Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour.\n\nThe new Marshal served with great success over the next few years in Austria, Italy and Naples and was further elevated to Duke of Rivoli. His incredible endurance at Genoa ultimately kept huge numbers of the Austrian force busy and thus allowed Napoleon to cross the St Bernard’s pass and defeat the enemy at Marengo. In 1808, he lost the sight of one eye following an accident at a hunting party. The shot was likely fired by Napoleon, who blamed it on Berthier!\n\nIn 1809, Masséna was active in the German campaign and continued to distinguish himself as one of Napoleon’s most valued subordinates. In May, he was at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. While Marshal Lannes held Essling, Masséna held Aspern under continuous Austrian attack. After suffering an injury from a fall from his horse, he led his men at Wagram from a carriage. Soon afterwards, Napoleon created him Prince of Essling.\n\nMasséna’s star started to fall when he was made commander of the Army of Portugal in 1810, a role he originally refused to take until Napoleon persuaded him otherwise. He brought his teenage mistress Henriette Leberton with him on campaign (dressed allegedly in a hussar uniform), and some subordinates remarked that he seemed to have lost his characteristic resolve and energy. He also met a real challenge in the shape of General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington.\n\nWellesley was of a different class to the Austrian and Russian generals Masséna had previously beaten. Thanks to his clever strategies, the French army was unable to advance beyond the Lines of Torres Vedras and, as Wellesley refused to be drawn out into a battle, they began to run out of supplies. Masséna had no option but to order his starving army to retreat in 1811. He was unable to relieve the siege at Almeida and was recalled to France by a disappointed Napoleon, who replaced him with Marmont. He did not hold a major command again for the rest of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAfter Napoleon’s abdication, Masséna accepted the new Bourbon regime, who forced him to become a French citizen after realising he technically wasn’t one by birth. During the Hundred Days, he refused to commit to either side.\n\nPost-Waterloo, he was in no hurry to prove himself a Royalist and was one of the marshals who refused to try Michel Ney, who he had not got on well with in Portugal. He died in Paris in 1817, leaving a huge fortune to his wife, and was buried in Père Lachaise cemetery.\n\nMasséna was widely known to be an inveterate looter with a strong sense of greed and a bad weakness for women. However, despite all this, his abilities on the battlefield were such that he was always respected.\n\nTrivia: Massena was a freemason and reportedly a member of multiple lodges. There are numerous places named after him in America and Nice.\n\nIn 2008, the Postal Service of Monaco released a stamp with his face on it."
