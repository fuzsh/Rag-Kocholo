        "text": "People:\n\nFrench, Austrians, Russians, Prussians, British,\n\nFrench Military Leaders\n\nNapoleon, Augereau, Bernadotte, Berthier, Bertrand, Bessieres, Brune, Davout, Guouvion St.-Cyr, Grouchy, Jourdan, Kellerman, Lannes, Lefebvre, MacDonald, Marmont, Massena, Moncey, Mortier, Murat, Ney, Oudinot, Perignon, Poniatowski, Serurier, Soult, Suchet, Vandamme, Victor, Prince Eugene, Leclerc, Moreau, Hoche, Dumouriez,\n\nNapoleon\n\nBonaparte, Napoleon (1769 - 1821)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nEmperor, coronation December 1804, proclaimed May 1804; Consul for Life, August 1802; Consul, November 1799; Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Italy, March 1796; Commander of artillery in Army of Italy, February 1794; General of Brigade, December 1793; Commander of artillery at siege of Toulon, September 1793; Second lieutenant in Artillery, 1785;\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded French Armee du Norde in 'Hundred Days' campaign of 1815, commanded at battles of Ligny and Waterloo;\n\nCommanded French Army in 1814 campaign in France, commanded at battles of Brienne, La Rothiere, Champaubert, Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, Vauchamps, Craonne, Laon, Rheims, and Arcis-sur-Aube.\n\nCommanded French Army in 1813 campaigns in Saxony, commanded at battles of Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Leipzig and Hanau.\n\nCommanded French Grande Armee in Russian campaign of 1812, commanded at battles of Vitebsk, Smolensk, Borodino, Krasnyi and Beresina.\n\nCommanded French Army in Austrian campaign of 1809, commanded at battles of Abensburg, Landshut, Eckmuhl, Ratisbon, Aspern-Essling and Wagram.\n\nCommanded French Army during part of Spanish campaign of 1808, commanded at battle of Somosierra.\n\nCommanded French Grande Armee in Polish campaign of 1807, commanded at battles of Eylau, Heilsberg and Friedland.\n\nCommanded French Army of the Main in Prussian campaign of 1806, commanded at battle of Jena.\n\nCommanded French Grande Armee in Austrian campaign of 1805, commanded at battles of Ulm, Hollabrunn and Austerlitz.\n\nCommanded (de facto) French Army of the Reserve in Italian campaign of 1800, commanded at battle of Marengo.\n\nCommanded French forces in Eygpt 1798-1799, commanded at battles of Alexandria, the Pyramids, El Arish, Jaffa, Mount Tabor and Aboukir.\n\nCommanded French Army of Italy in campaign of 1796-1797, commanded at battles of Montenotte , Millesimo , Dego , Ceva , Mondovi , Fombio , Lodi , Borghetto , Lonato, Castiglione, Bassano, First Caldiero, Arcola and Rivoli.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAn outstanding soldier-politician Napoleon is acknowledged as one of the half dozen or less great captains of history. He was daring, opportunistic and sought outright smashing victory. He lent his name to his era.\n\nAugereau\n\nAugereau, Pierre Francois Charles (1757 - 1816)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuc de Castiglione, 1808; Marshall of the Empire, 1804; General of Division, 1793;\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Armee du Rhone in French campaign of 1814;\n\nCommanded XVI Corps in 1813, commanded at battle of Naumburg, participated in battle of Leipzig;\n\nCommanded VIII Corps occupying Prussia in 1812;\n\nCommanded Armee de Catlogne, June 1809 - March 1810;\n\nCommanded VIII Corps March-June 1809;\n\nCommanded VII Corps in Grande Armee from 1803 and in Austrian campaign of 1805, Prussian campaign of 1807, and Polish campaign of 1807, participated in battles of Jena and Eylau.;\n\nCommanded French Forces in Holland 1799;\n\nCommanded Army of Germany September 1797 to January 1798.\n\nCommanded Corps in Army of Italy 1795-1797, leading role in battles of Loano, Lodi , Castiglione, and Arcola.;\n\nCommanded a wing of the Army of the Pyrenees between December 1793 and September 1795, distinguishing himself at battle of San Lorenso-de-la-Muga.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA rough man, and a venal one while he was still making his fortune, but a very professional soldier and a fighter. His role in Napoleon's first Italian campaign probably assures his place in history. At Eylau he was very roughly handled along with his corps and doesn't seem to have been ever quite the same afterwards.\n\nBernadotte\n\nBernadotte, Jean Baptiste, (1763 - 1844)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nCrown Prince of Sweden (Charles John) 1810, Prince de Porte-Corvo 1806, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1794, General de Brigade 1794, Colonel 1794, Major 1794, Lieutenant 1791, Regimental Sergeant Major 1790, Sergeant 1785, Corporal 1785\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Allied Army of the North in 1813, participated in Battle of Leipzig, Commanded at battles of Dennewitz and Gross-Beeren.\n\nCommanded 'French' IX Corps (composed of Saxons) in 1809, participated in Battle of Wagram.\n\nCommanded I Corps of Grande Armee 1805 to 1807, participated in Battle of Austerlitz in 1805. Is infamous for having missed both the Battles of Jena and Auerstadt in 1806, but later that year won an action at Halle against odds.\n\nCommanded 4th Division in Army of Italy during 1797.\n\nCommanded a division in the Battle of Kreusnach in 1795\n\nCommanded a brigade at the Battle of Fluerus in 1794, in a manner which led to his exceedingly rapid promotion that year.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nDied the reigning King of Sweden. Having contributed significantly to Napoleon's defeats in 1813 he has ever since been considered a traitor by many Frenchmen. A very political animal he seems to have been considered suspect by Napoleon from the very beginning of their association in Italy during 1797. Assessments of his reported behaviour in 1806 and 1809 should keep the resulting bias in mind. In fact Bernadotte's personal bravery was incontestable, as well as showly conspicuous. As a general he seems to have been quite competant if cautious.\n\nBertrand\n\nBertrand, Henri-Gatien, (1773 - 1844)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGrand Marshall of the Palace 1813, Governer of Illyria 1811-1812, Comte 1808, General de Division 1807, Inspector General of Engineers 1804, General de Brigade 1800, Engineer Officer 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought during \"Hundred Days\" 1815\n\nFought in France campaign spring 1814\n\nLed IV Corps in Germany 1813, fighting at Battles of Gross-Beeren, Dennewitz, and Leipzig\n\nResponsible for building the Danube bridges for both the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram in 1809\n\nServed in campaigns of 1805, 1806 and 1807\n\nServed in Eygpt and Syria\n\nServed in Italian campaign 1797\n\nIn Summary:\n\nBertrand was staunchly loyal to Napoleon. He performed whatever tasks he was given with a solid competance. He does not seem to have shown any great spark, or displayed any vision beyond that.\n\nBerthier\n\nBerthier, Louis Alexandre, (1753 - 1815)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nPeer of France 1814, Colonel General of the Swiss 1810, Prince of Wagram 1809, Vice-Constable of the Empire 1807, Sovereign Prince of Newchatel and Valangin 1806, Major-general, Chief of Staff of La Grande Armee 1805, Senator, Grand Officier of the Palace, Grand Master of the Hunt, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1795, re-instituted General de Brigade 1795, Suspended from general rank volunteers as private 1792, Marechal de camp (equiv. Brigadier General) 1792, Colonel adjutant general 1791, Lieutenant Colonel 1789, Major 1788, Captain 1777, Lieutenant 1770\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nSee numerous battles Napoleon was in between 1796 and 1814, as Berthier was his indispensable Chief of Staff throughout.\n\nHe was not present for the \"Hundred Days\" campaign of 1815 having fallen to his death earlier that year.\n\nHe was in nominal command of the Army of Reserve in 1800.\n\nCommanded the Army of Italy after Napoleons departure in 1797 and carried out an invasion of the Papal States.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nBerthier was a well trained staff officer with over 15 years experience in the Royal Army, including time in America, when the Revolution came. Unlike many Royal officers he stayed in France. He served as Chief of Staff for the Army of the North in 1792, before being suspended. In 1795 he was restored to his rank and became Chief of Staff for the Army of Italy where he and Napoleon began their long partnership after Napoleons appointment to command in 1796. Berthier's staff work was an important contributing factor in Napoleon's successes and when he was unavailable in 1815 he was sorely missed. He was much more than a mere clerk, both in importance and personality. It is hard to imagine a 'clerk' leading a column of infantry across the bridge at Lodi through a hail of Austrian fire in the manner that Berthier did.\n\nBessieres\n\nBessieres, Jean-Baptiste, (1768 - 1813)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Istria 1809, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1802, General de Brigade 1800\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nKilled the day before the Battle of Lutzen in 1813, while commanding the cavalry of the Army of the Main\n\nCommanded the cavalry of the Imperial Guard in the Russian Campaign of 1812\n\nCommanded Army of the North (in Spain) in 1811, participated in Battle of Fuentes de Onoro.\n\nDistinguished himself in command of cavalry at Aspern-Essling and Wagram 1809\n\nCommanded Reserve Cavalry at Eckmuhl 1809\n\nCommanded the Corps of Observation of the Western Pyrenees in 1808, commanded at the Battle of Medina de Rio Seco, a major French victory.\n\nCommanded Second Corps of the Reserve Cavalry in 1807 Polish campaign, participated in the Battle of Eylau\n\nCommanded Imperial Guard in 1805 and 1806, participating in Battle of Austerlitz.\n\nCommanded Guard Cavalry in Campaign of 1800, participating in Battle of Marengo.\n\nPresent with Napoleon in Eygptian Campaign during 1798-1799, fights at Battle of Aboukir\n\nGiven command of Napoleons newly formed bodyguards, the Guides of the Army of Italy, in 1796. This originally rather small unit would become part of the core around which the Imperial Guard was developed.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA good and loyal friend to Napoleon. He was generally well liked. At the time he became Marshall he had yet to hold any large command let alone an independent one. This didn't sit entirely well with some of the other Marshalls. Nevertheless he proved himself a brave and effective commander of cavalry on the battlefield and a competant general in independent command. Some reason to believe he may have been too pessimistic and cautious. Apparently he was not as aggressive in pursuit as he could have been at his great victory of Medina de Rio Seco. He may have helped lose the Battle of Fuentos de Onoro with his tardiness. His advice to Napoleon in 1812 is credited with helping to lose the Russian Campaign.\n\nBrune\n\nBrune, Guillaume-Marie-Anne (1763 - 1815)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1797, General de Brigade 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nAugust 1800 succeeds Messena as commander in chief in Italy\n\nCommanded French Forces in Holland in 1799, commanded at Battles of Alkmaar and Castricum.\n\nCommanded Army of Switzerland in 1798, he invaded Switzerland and seized the Swiss Treasury\n\nServed under Massena during the First Italian Campaign (1796-1797), fighting at the battles of Arcola and Rivoli.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAn ardent Republican and military politician. A good part of Brunes career was spent heading military governments. He had a reputation for harshness. Brune was described by Suchet who was his subordinate in Italy in 1798 as a \"most shameless plunderer\". Napoleon apparently believed him unfit for high command. However, he was personally brave and his defence of Holland against an Anglo-Russian landing in 1799 was creditable. His promotion to Marshall of the Empire in 1804 while he was Ambassador to Turkey may have been political. The fact he was mostly unemployed thereafter was almost certainly so, republicanism being out of fashion with Napoleon.\n\nDavout\n\nDavout, Louis Nicholas (1770 - 1823)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nPrince of Eckmuhl 1809, Duke of Auerstadt 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1800, General de Brigade 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommander of garrison in Hamburg 1813-1814\n\nCommands I Corps in defense of Dresden, March 1813\n\nCommands I Corps in Russian Campaign of 1812, fighting at Borodino and Krasoe\n\nCommands Army of Germany 1810-1812\n\nCommands III Corps 1805-1809, participating in Battles of Wagram, Eckmuhl, Eylau, Auerstadt, and Austerlitz.\n\n1798 - 1799 in Eygpt with Napoleon, campaigned in Upper Eygpt under his friend Desaix, he distinguished himself both there and in the later Battle of Aboukir.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nDavout is on the short list for Napoleon's best general. At the end he was one of the few that could safely be entrusted with independent command. He was completely loyal to Napoleon and an excellent administrator which lead to his employment in non-military roles like Minister of War during the 'Hundred Days' campaign of 1815. His troops were always well disciplined, trained, and supplied. His crowning glory was the Battle of Auerstadt which his III Corps won against the better part of the Prussian Army while Napoleon was fighting the smaller part at Jena.\n\nGouvion St.-Cyr\n\nGouvion St.Cyr, Laurent (1764 - 1830)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1812, Count of the Empire 1808, General de Division 1794, General de Brigade 1794\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nGovernor of Dresden 1813, fought at Battle of Dresden\n\nCommanded VI (Bavarian) Corps of La Grande Armee in Russian Campaign in 1812, commanded at Battles of First Polotsk and Second Polotsk.\n\nCommanded Army of Catalonia 1808-1809, winning victories at Cordadeu, Molinos de Rey, and Valls. Failed in Seige of Gerona.\n\nCommanded 'Corps of Observation of the Kingdom of Naples' 1803-1805, commanded at Battle of Castelfranco in 1805 winning a notable victory\n\nAssumes Command of Corps in Army of the Rhine in December 1799, winning a victory at the Second Battle of Biberach in spring of 1800\n\nDistinguished himself while commanding French Forces in Liguria against Austrians during 1799\n\nCommanded right wing at Battle of Novi in October 1799\n\nDistinguished himself at First Battle of Biberach in 1796\n\nIn Summary:\n\nSt.Cyr, later to reorganize the Bourbon Army, seems to have been a cold, but very good general. He repeatedly won victories in secondary theatres that are now all but forgotten. He also repeatedly quarreled with his superiors and peers.\n\nGrouchy\n\nGrouchy, Emmanuel, (1766 - 1847)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1815, General de Division 1794, Lieutenant-Colonel 1791, Captain 1784, Lieutenant 1781, Hereditary Marquis\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded at battle of Wavre 1815\n\nCommanded right wing of Army of the North in 'Hundred Days' Campaign in 1815\n\nAs commander of cavalry fought at Battles of Brienne, Vauchamps, Troyes, and Croanne in 1814\n\nAt Borodino in 1812, commanded bataillon sacre in retreat from Moscow\n\nWas at Battle of Wagram in 1809\n\nSpain 1808\n\nAgain commanded cavalry for Battle of Friedland in 1807\n\nCommanded Dragoons at Eylau 1807\n\nCommanded 2nd Dragoon Division in pursuit after Battles of Jena and Auerstadt in 1806\n\nAt Capitulation of Ulm 1805\n\nCommanded infantry division on Rhine (South German Front) during Battle of Hohenlinden in 1800\n\nIn 1797 fought at Novi and captured at Pasturana\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAn excellent heavy cavalry general who had served in the Royal Army and was in fact a member of the nobility. This last didn't help his career in Revolutionary France, but he gave good service despite it. Grouchy's reputation suffers from his having been blamed for Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.\n\nJourdan\n\nJourdan, Jean-Baptiste (1762 - 1833)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1793, General de Brigade 1793, 'chef de bataillon' (Colonel) 1791, Captain 1789\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nWhile Chief of Staff to the Army of Spain defeated by Wellington at Vitoria in 1813\n\nCommanded French forces at Battle of Talavera in 1809\n\nCommanded French forces at Battle of Stockach in 1799\n\nCommanded the Army of the Sambre and Moselle in Battle of Wurzburg in 1795\n\nCommanded the Army of the Moselle in Battle of Fleurus in 1794\n\nCommanded the Army of the North in Battle of Wattignies in 1793\n\nFought at Battle of Neerwinden in 1793\n\nFought at Battle of Jemappes in 1792\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA former private in the Royal Army, an honest man, and a good general Jourdan survived holding high command in Revolutionary France. He became a Marshall of the Empire only to encounter disrespect and insubordination in Spain where he twice suffered embarrassing defeats at the hands of Wellington.\n\nKellerman\n\nKellerman, Francois-Christophe, (1735 - 1820)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Valmy 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, Lieutenant-General (equivalent later General de Division) 1792, 'marechal de camp' (equivalent later General de Brigade) 1788, Lieutenant-Colonel 1772, Captain 1761, Lieutenant 1756\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded French Army of the Center in the critical Battle of Valmy in 1792\n\nHeld a variety of Army commands from 1791 to 1795.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThis is Kellerman 'senior'. Essentially he was a renowned Revolutionary General who was honoured in Napoleon's new Empire for political reasons.\n\nLannes\n\nLannes, Jean (1769 - 1809)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Montebello 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1800, General de Brigade 1797\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded II Corps of Grande Armee at Battle of Aspern-Essling May 1809, where killed\n\nCommanded Provisional Corps at Battles of Abensburg, Landshut, Eckmuhl, and Ratisbon in April 1809\n\nCommanded at seige of Saragossa January 1809\n\nCommanded at Battle of Tudela 1808\n\nCommanded Reserve Corps Battles of Heilsberg and Friedland, also the siege of Danzig 1807\n\nCommanded V Corps of Grande Armee at Battle of Pultusk, December 1806\n\nCommanded V Corps of Grande Armee at Battles of Saalfeld and Jena, October 1806\n\nCommanded IV Corps of Grande Armee at Battle of Austerlitz, December 1805\n\nCommanded IV Corps of Grande Armee at Battle of Hollabrun, November 1805\n\nCommanded IV Corps of Grande Armee at Battle of Ulm, October 1805\n\nCommanded Advance Guard of Army of the Reserve at Battles of Montebello and Marengo in 1800\n\nCommanded a division at Battles of Acre (siege), Jaffa, and Aboukir in 1799\n\nCommanded brigade at Battle of Alexandria in 1798\n\nFought at Battles of Arcola, Bassano, Fombio , Lodi , Volti and Dego , in 1796\n\nIn Summary:\n\nIncredibly brave even by the standards of the time, wounded three times at Arcola. Lannes was also well liked and intelligent. His death meant the loss of one of Napoleons best battlefield generals and one of his best friends.\n\nLefebvre\n\nLefebvre, Francois-Joseph, (1755 - 1820)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Danzig 1807, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1794, General de Brigade 1793, Captain 1792, Lieutenant 1789, Sergeant 1782\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought at Battles of Arcis-sur-Aube, Montereau, and Champaubert in 1814\n\nCommanded Old Guard Infantry during Russian Campaign of 1812\n\nCommanded VII(Bavarian) Corps of Grande Armee at Battles of Abensburg and Eckmuhl\n\nParticipated in Battle of Espinosa 1808\n\nCommanded IV Corps in Spain at Battle of Durango 1808\n\nCommands X Corps in siege of Danzig 1807\n\nFought at Battle of Altenkirchen in 1796\n\nFought at Battle of Fluerus in 1794\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThe epitome of the good old soldier Lefebvre was a solid leader of troops, who had mixed results while in independent command.\n\nMacDonald\n\nMacDonald, Jacques Etienne Joseph Alexandre (1774 - 1852)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Taranto 1809, Marshall of the Empire 1809, General de Division 1794, Captain 1792, Lieutenant 1785\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded XI Corps and small groups of other Corps in Northern France during 1814 campaign\n\nCommanded XI Corps at Battle of Leipzig in October 1813\n\nCommanded French Army of the Bober at Battle of Katzbach in August 1813\n\nCommanded XI Corps at Battle of Bautzen in May 1813\n\nCommanded XI Corps at Battle of Lutzen in May 1813\n\nCommanded X Corps in Lithuania during Russian campaign of 1812\n\nCommanded French Army of Catalonia in 1810\n\nCommanded his 'wing' of Army of Italy at Battle of Wagram in 1809. It was the march of a gigantic square of his men that broke the Austrian center and won him his baton.\n\nCommanded wing of the Army of Italy in spring of 1809\n\nFought at Battle of Jemappes in 1792\n\nIn Summary:\n\nNot necessarily the bluff honest soldier he portrayed himself as, MacDonald was a good Corps commander who proved rather too inflexible in independent Army command.\n\nMarmont\n\nMarmont, August-Frederic-Louis Viesse (1774 - 1852)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1809, Duke of Ragusa 1808, Governor of Dalmatia 1806, General de Division 1800, General de Brigade 1798, 'chef de bataillon' 1796, Captain 1793, Lieutenant 1792\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded XI Corps at Battles of La Rothiere, Champaubert, Vauchamps, Laon, La Fere-Champenoise, and Romainville in 1814 compaign in France\n\nCommanded VI Corps at Battles of Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden and Leipzig in 1813\n\nCommanded French Army of Portugal at Battle of Salamanca in 1812\n\nCommanded XI Corps at Battle of Wagram in 1809.\n\nCommanded II Corps of Grand Armee at Battle of Ulm in 1805\n\nCommanded Artillery at Battle of Marengo in 1800\n\nFought at Battles of Alexandria and the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798\n\nFought at Battles of Mondovi , Lodi , Castiglione and Arcola in 1796\n\nParticipated in seige of Toulon in 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nPersonally brave and a friend of Napoleon's Marmont was a capable soldier and an effective adminstrator. During his term of office as governor of Dalmatia he both secured the region for France and made significant civil improvements. Despite his accomplishments he tends to be remembered for his defeat at Salamanca and his treacherous surrender of his Corps in 1814.\n\nMassena\n\nMassena, Andre (1758 - 1817)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nPrince of Essling 1810, Duke of Rivoli 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1793, General de Brigade 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded French Army of Portugal at Battle of Fuentes de Onoro in 1811\n\nCommanded French Army of Portugal at Battle of Bussaco in 1810\n\nCommanded IV Corps at Wagram in 1809\n\nCommanded IV Corps at Aspern-Essling in 1809\n\nCommanded V Corps of Grande Armee during Polish campaign in 1807\n\nCommanded Army of Italy at Battle of Verona-Caldiero in 1805\n\nCommanded Garrison of Genoa during seige 1800\n\nCommanded Army of the Danube at Second Battle of Zurich September 1799\n\nCommanded Army of the Danube at First Battle of Zurich June 1799\n\nCommands French forces in Battle of Trevisio Pass March 1797\n\nFights at Battle of Rivoli January 1797\n\nMajor role in Battles of Lonato, Castiglione and Arcola in 1796\n\nCommands French forces at Battles of Montenotte , Dego and Mondovi in 1796\n\nCommands French forces at Battle of Loano in 1795\n\nTakes part in recapture of Toulon in 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nOne of France's best Generals. He was major contributor to the successes of the Army of Italy under Napoleon in 1796 and 1797. Served well in independent command, especially during the defense of Switzerland in 1799. Was noted for having a weakness both for plunder and women. By 1810 when he faced Wellington he was tired and past his prime.\n\nMoncey\n\nMoncey, (Jeannet de Moncey) Bon-Adrien (1754 - 1842)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Conegliano 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1794, General de Brigade\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded III Corps of the Army of Spain in Battles of Lerrin and Tudela in 1808\n\nCommanded Army of the Western Pyrenees in engagements at Lecumberry and Villanova in October 1794\n\nLead 1st Division at Battles of St.Jean Pied de Porte and Arquinzu in summer 1794.\n\nCommanded demi-brigade at Hendaye in February 1794\n\nCommanded demi-brigade at St.Jean de Luz in July 1793\n\nCommanded 5th Light demi-brigade of Army of the Western Pyrenees at Aldudes in June 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nMoncey was an honest and humane man, also a good soldier. He does not seem to have been a great general. He does seem to have been a fairly lucky and competant one, having done well during his command of the Army of the Western Pyrenees. He was not one of Napoleon's inner circle and seems to have been made a Marshall mainly for political reasons.\n\nMortier\n\nMortier, Adolphe-Edouard-Casimir-Joseph (1768 - 1835)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Treviso 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Divison 1799, General de Brigade 1799, Colonel 1795, Major 1793, Captain 1791\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Old Guard in French campaign of 1814, fought at Battles of Bar-sur-Aube, Montmirail, Croanne and Laon\n\nCommanded Young Guard in German campaign of 1813, fought at Battles of Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nCommanded Young Guard in Russian campaign of 1812, fought in Battles of Krasnoe and Beresina\n\nIn tactical command at Battle of the Gebora in 1810\n\nWhile commanding V Corps wounded at Battle of Ocana in 1809\n\nCommanded French left wing (reinforced VIII Corps) at Battle of Friedland June 1807\n\nCommanded French forces at Battle of Anclam April 1807\n\nCommanded French forces at Battle of Durrenstein 1805\n\nCommanded 100th Demi-brigade during Second Battle of Zurich in 1799, was promoted to General de Division on battlefield for his performance.\n\nLed a brigade at Battle of Stockach in 1799\n\nFought at Battles of Altenkirchen and Friedberg in 1796\n\nFought at Battle of Fleurus in 1794\n\nFought at Battle of Wattignies 1793\n\nFought at Battle of Jemappes 1792\n\nFought at Quievrain in 1792\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA good soldier and able administrator. Mortier had little chance to prove himself in independent commands but seems to have done well in the ones he was given. He missed Waterloo through illness, and went on to serve the Bourbons well and loyally.\n\nMurat\n\nMurat, Joachim (1767 - 1815)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nKing of Naples 1808, Grand Duke of Cleves and Berg 1806, Prince of the Empire 1805, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1796, Colonel 1795, Major 1793, Captain 1793, Lieutenant 1792\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded French-Italian forces at Battle of Tollentino in 1815\n\nCommanded 7th Army in Italy during 1814\n\nAgain led Napoleon's cavalry in German campaign of fall 1813, fought at battles of Dresden and Leipzig\n\nCommanded cavalry of Grande Armee during Russian Campaign in 1812, fought at Battles of Smolensk, Krasnoe, Borodino and Vinikovo\n\nKing of Naples July 1808\n\nCommander-in-Chief of Army of Spain in 1808\n\nAgain led cavalry in Prussian and Polish campaigns of 1806 and 1807, fighting at Battles of Jena, Eylau and Heilsberg.\n\nLead cavalry in Austrian campaign of 1805 and fought at Battle of Austerlitz\n\nCommander-in-chief of Napoleon's cavalry in campaign of 1800.\n\nFought at Battle of Aboukir in 1799\n\nLeads first cavalry charge in Battle of Dego , during 1796\n\nMade Colonel for his part in arranging Napoleon's 'Whiff of Grapeshot' during 1795\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA superb leader of cavalry on the battlefield Murat was also a member of the imperial family and an important statesman. He is probably discounted in this last role because of his flamboyence and the final failure of his designs. He was not as a strong a military administrator as he was a leader and this seems to have cost the French cavalry severely in Russia.\n\nNey\n\nNey, Michel (1769 - 1815)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nPrince of the Moskowa 1813, Duke of Elchingen 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1796, Captain 1794, Lieutenant 1792, Regimental Sergeant Major 1792\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded left wing of the Army of the North during the Waterloo Campaign 1815, commanded at Battle of Quartre Bras and fought at Battle of Waterloo\n\nParticipated in French Campaign of 1814, fought at Battles of Montmirail, Croanne and Laon\n\nCommanded III Corps throughout 1813 campaign in Germany, during Battles of Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, and Leipzig. Was in command of left wing of several corps at Bautzen and commanded the Army of Berlin at the Battle of Dennewitz.\n\nCommanded III Corps during Russian campaign of 1812, fought at Battles of Smolensk, Borodino and Krasnoe. Commanded rear-guard during retreat.\n\nCommanded VI Corps of Army of Portugal during years 1810 and 1811, fought at Battle of Bussaco, conducted seiges of Cuidad Rodrigo and Almeida.\n\nCommanded VI Corps of Grande Armee in campaigns of 1805, 1806, and 1807, fought at Battles of Eylau, Friedland, Jena and Elchingen\n\nFought at Battle of Hohenlinden in 1800\n\nFought at Mannheim in December 1799\n\nFought at Wurzberg in July 1799\n\nFought at Altenkirchen in 1796\n\nFought at Mainz in 1794\n\nIn Summary:\n\nPossessing great tactical skill and inexhaustible energy Ney is remembered as \"the bravest of the brave\". As a battlefield commander he would often attempt and achieve the impossible showing a special penchant for rear guard actions in the retreats from Portugal and Moscow. His reputation in general, and particularly that of his intellect, have suffered from his performance during the 1815 Waterloo campaign, and the misfortunes he suffered in independent command during 1813 at the Battles of Bautzen and Dennewitz. This likely somewhat unfair historical assessment may be in part due to the writings of his former Chief of Staff, Jomini.\n\nOudinot\n\nOudinot, Nicholas-Charles (1767 - 1847)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Reggio 1810, Marshall of the Empire 1809, Count of the Empire 1808, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1794, Lieutenant Colonel 1791, Captain 1789\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded VII Corps during 1814 campaign in France, fought at battles of Brienne, Vauchamps, Valjouan, Montereau, La Rothiere and Arcis-sur-Aube\n\nCommanded Army of Berlin at Battle of Gross-Beeren in August 1813\n\nCommanded XII Corps April to May 1813, participated in Battle of Bautzen\n\nCommanded II Corps on northern flank during Russian campaign of 1812, fought at Battles of Wilkomir, Jakowo, Oboiartsina, Polotsk and Beresina.\n\nCommanded II Corps at Battle of Wagram in 1809\n\nFought at Battles of Pfaffenhofen, Landshut, Abensberg and Aspern-Essling in 1809\n\nParticipated in Battle of Friedland and Seige of Danzig in 1807\n\nFought at Battle of Hollabrunn in 1805\n\nAmong beseiged at Genoa in 1800\n\nFought at First and Second Battles of Zurich, and Battle of Frauenfeld in 1799\n\nFought and first wounded at Geisberg in 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThe 'most wounded' of Napoleon's Marshalls, Oudinot seems to have been an outstanding divisional commander and trainer of men. He also seems to have been a fair Chief of Staff. In independent command his record seems weak.\n\nPerignon\n\nPerignon, Catherine Dominique (1754 - 1818)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nCount of the Empire 1808, Honorary Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1793, General de Brigade 1793, Lieutenant Colonel 1789, Lieutenant 1780\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded left wing of Army of Italy at Battle of Novi in 1799\n\nCommanded Army of the Eastern Pyrenees August 1794 to July 1795\n\nFought in multiple actions of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees 1792 to 1794\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAlthough he performed well during his stint as a soldier and commander in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, Perignon seems to have been more of a political and diplomatic figure than a military one. His appointment as a Marshall was certainly political and honorary.\n\nPoniatowski\n\nPoniatowski, Joseph-Anthony (1763 - 1813)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nMarshall of the Empire 1813, Polish Major-General 1789, Colonel in Austrian Army 1788, Lieutenant Colonel in Austrian Army 1786, Hereditary Prince of Poland and Bohemia\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought and died (4 days after receiving his baton) at Battle of Leipzig in October 1813\n\nCommanded VIII Corps in German campaign of 1813\n\nCommanded V Corps of Grande Armee in Russian campaign of 1812, fought at Battles of Smolensk, Borodino and Spass Kouplia.\n\nLed Polish Army against Austrians in 1809\n\nFought in Polish insurrection of 1794\n\nCommanded Polish Army against Russians in 1792\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAn aristocratic politician and Polish patriot, the Prince was personally brave and made a good corps commander. He seems to have done good work in building up and training Polish armies. Napoleon's making him a Marshall was more of a political than a military move.\n\nSerurier\n\nSerurier, Jean-Mathieu-Philbert (1742 - 1819)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nCount of the Empire 1808, Honorary Marshall of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1794, Lieutenant Colonel 1791, Major 1789, Captain 1779, Lieutenant 1762\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought and was captured in Italian campaign of 1799\n\nCommanded division in Army of Italy 1796 to 1797, fought at Battles of Castiglione, Borghetto , and Mondovi . Wounded at seige of Warburg in 1760\n\nIn Summary:\n\nOne of the three senior division commanders along with Augereau and Massena who helped make Napoleon's career establishing Italian campaign of 1796-7 possible. Serurier was noted for being a reliable and honest soldier of the old school as might be expected of a man who already had 34 years of military service in 1789. His appointment to Marshall was a reward for past service.\n\nSoult\n\nSoult, Nicolas-Jean de Dieu (1769 - 1851)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Dalmatia 1808, Marshal of the Empire 1804, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1794, Chef de battalion 1793, First enlisted 1785\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nChief of Staff to the Army of the North during the Waterloo Campaign of 1815\n\nCommanded French at Battle of Toulouse April 10th 1814, which was the final act of the hard fought Campaign of the Pyrenees (from July 1813) against Allied forces led by Wellington.\n\nCommanded left wing of French main force at Battle of Bautzen in May of 1813\n\nCommanded Army of Andalusia from June 1810 until January 1813, fighting the Battle of Albuera in May 1811\n\nMajor General (Chief of Staff) to King Joseph of Spain 1809\n\nCommanded at Battle of Oporto in May 1809, and Battle of Ocana in November of 1809\n\nCommands II Corps in French pursuit of British under Sir John Moore during their retreat to Corunna in 1808\n\nCommanded IV Corps from 1805 to 1807, fighting in battles of Austerlitz (1805), Jena (1806), Eylau (1807), and Heilsberg(1807)\n\nServed with Massena during seige of Genoa in 1800\n\nand the Defense of Zurich in 1799\n\nFought at Battle of Stockach in March 1799\n\nFought at Battle of Fleurus in 1794\n\nIn Summary:\n\nSoult was one of Napoleon's better generals being a good strategist and planner of battles. His front line leadership, when he exercised it, was also outstanding. He seems to have lacked determination when in independent command. He was not a particularly inspirational leader or adept at politics. He was notorious as a looter. He did poorly as Napoleon's Chief of Staff during the Waterloo campaign.\n\nSuchet\n\nSuchet, Louis-Gabriel (1772 - 1826)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Albufera da Valencia 1813, Colonel-General of the Imperial Guard 1813, Marshall of the Empire 1811, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1798, Lieutenant-Colonel 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded VII Corps of Observation and military districts around Lyons April 1815\n\nCommanded V Corps of Observation around Strasbourg March 1815\n\nCommander in Chief of the Army of Catalonia and Aragon 1813\n\nCommanded Army of Aragon in taking of Valancia 1812\n\nSeige of Tarragona 1811\n\nIn June of 1810 took Lerida and Mequinenza, in July took Tortosa.\n\nTook command III Corps in Spain (later renamed Army of Aragon) in April of 1809, defeated at Battle of Alcaniz in May, achieved victories against Spanish under Blake at Battles of Maria and Belchite in June. Also received governership of Aragon at this time.\n\nIn command of 1st division of V Corps at Battle of Pultusk in December 1806\n\nCommanded 1st division of V Corps at Battle of Saalfeld and Battle of Jena in October 1806\n\nCommanded 3rd division of V Corps at Battles of Ulm, Hullabrun, and Austerlitz during Austrian Campaign of 1805.\n\nCommanded French Forces defending Southern France along the line of the Vars in May 1800\n\nWas Chief-of-Staff of Army of Italy at Battle of Novi in August 1799.\n\nWounded at Neumarkt in April 1799\n\nServed at battle of Rivoli in January 1797\n\nIn 1796 fought with 18th Line Regiment at Battles of Dego , Lodi , Borghetto , Castiglione, Peschiera and Bassano. Wounded at Ceria in September.\n\nGiven command of 4th battalion of the 18th Line Regiment, fighting at Battle of Loano in November 1795\n\nParticipated in Seige of Toulon in 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nTalented as a tactician, organizer and administrator, Suchet did well in independent commands. He was one of Napoleon's best generals, the only one to enhance his reputation in Spain.\n\nVandamme\n\nVandamme, Dominique Joseph Rene (1770 - 1830)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nPeer of France 1815, Comte d'Unsebourg 1808, General de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1793, Captain 1792, Volunteer in West Indies 1790\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought at battles of Ligny and Wavre in 1815\n\nLed III Corps in Belgium 1815\n\nCommanded I Corps at battle of Kulmn August 1813, where he was captured\n\nFought under Davout at Hamburg and Madgeburg spring 1813\n\nLed II and VIII Corps under Jerome in Russia 1812\n\nLed VII Corps at battle of Wagram 1809\n\nFought at battles of Abensburg, Landshut, and Eckmuhl in spring of 1809\n\nLed the VIII Corps of Wurtemburgers in Austrian campaign of 1809\n\nFought at Madgeburg and other seiges 1806-1807\n\nLed division at Austerlitz under Soult in IV Corps in 1805\n\nFought on the Rhine during the campaign of 1800\n\nLed division in Jourdan's army at Stockach 1799\n\nWith Moreau's Army of the Rhine 1797\n\nFought at Courtrai May 1794\n\nServed under Moreau 1793-1795\n\nLed Advance Guard at Hondschotte 1793\n\nFought in Belgium and Holland in 1792\n\nWith volunteers in West Indies 1790\n\nIn Summary:\n\nA bad man but a good soldier. Repeatedly dismissed for looting and depredations. Hated by the Germans. Acquited himself well in the thick of the action for the full duration of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Seems to have been capable of independant command. The disaster he led his Corps into at Kulmn is at least partly his fault, but the major portion of the blame belongs at Napoleon's doorstep who being distracted failed to co-ordinate the pursuing Corps. However, Vandamme was captured and Napoleon wrote the after action reports. The relevant documentation appears to have mysteriously disappeared. Vandamme who respected Napoleon remained silent.\n\nVictor\n\nVictor, Claude-Victor (1764 - 1841)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Bellano 1808, Marshall of the Empire 1807, General de Division 1797, General de Brigade 1793, Colonel 1793\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nGiven a command in the Imperial Guard was wounded at Craonne in March 1814, his last battle\n\nSacked for poor performance at Battle of Montmirail in February 1814\n\nParticipated in French Campaign of 1814 fightting at Battles of Brienne and La Rothiere in January 1814\n\nCommanded II Corps at Battles of Dresden and Leipzig during 1813 Fall Campaign in Germany\n\nCommanded IX Corps in Russian Campaign of 1812, fought significant rear guard action on Beresina.\n\nDefeated at Barossa in 1811\n\nCommanding I Corps in Spain led French Forces at Battle of Medellin in March 1809, and fought at Battle of Talavera in July 1809\n\nDistinguished himself commanding I Corps at Battle of Friedland in 1807\n\nIn 1806 as Chief-of-Staff to Lannes commanding V Corps he participated in Battles of Saalfeld, Jena, and Pultusk, being wounded at Jena.\n\nHeld Corps command in Army of Reserve during 1800 fighting at Battles of Montbello and Marengo.\n\nWounded at Trebbia in 1799\n\nLed reserves at Battle of Rivoli in 1797\n\nLed first 18th Line regiment then 57th Line regiment, in Napoleon's First Italian Campaign, fighting at Battles of Borghetto , Lonato, Dego and Roverdo in 1796\n\nParticipated in Seige of Toulon in 1793\n\nIn Summary:\n\nVictor was a capable general, but not one of Napoleon's best. He was an excellent organizer and tactician.\n\nPrince Eugene\n\nBeauharnais, Eugene de (1781 - 1824)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nColonel-General of the Chasseurs of the Guard, Viceroy of Italy, Prince of the Empire 1805; General 1804; Colonel 1802; Napoleon's Aide-de-camp in Eygpt 1798-99, and Italy 1796.\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\n1814 commanded French forces in Italy continuing to hold it against the Austrians\n\nPlayed major role at Battle of Lutzen in early May 1813 and was then sent to organize defence of Italy\n\nFrom January to April of 1813 commanded the remenants of the Grande Armee (renamed Army of the Elbe)defending Poland and Germany against pursuing Russians.\n\nDuring Russian Campaign of 1812 led Italian contingent (IV Corps a.k.a Army of Italy) and commanded Northern Wing of advance. Fought at Battles of Borodino and Maloyaroslavets\n\nCommanded Army of Italy in 1809, commanded French forces at Battles of Socile, Piave and Raab. Fought at Battle of Wagram.\n\nFought as squadorn leader in Chasseurs de Cheval of the Consular Guard at the Battle of Marengo in 1800.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nEugene was honest and loyal as man, capable as a general, and competant in independent command. As Napoleon's step-son he had little need to indulge in self-promotion and only recently is his military reputation starting to improve as historians re-examine the historical record. His personal and political reputations have always been good.\n\nLeclerc\n\nLeclerc, Victor Emmanuel (1772 - 1802)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGeneral de Division 1799, General de Brigade 1797, Lieutenant 1791\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\n1801 Appointed to command of expedition to Santo Domingo\n\n1801 Commanded Corps assisting Spanish against Portugal\n\n1800 Fought in battles of Hochstadt and Landshut\n\n1796-7 Fought in first Italian Campaign, present at battles of Castiglione and Rivoli\n\n1793 Distinguished himself in siege of Toulon becoming a favorite of Napoleon's\n\n1791 Participated in fighting on the Lower Rhine\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAn outstanding officer Leclerc was also Napoleon's brother-in-law having married Pauline Bonaparte in 1797. He spent a fair amount of time in staff postings during the mid-1790's. Initially sucessful in his expedition to Santo Domingo pacifying the black rebellion in what is now Haiti, his position was undermined by political decisions made in France. He died of yellow fever in November 1802.\n\nMoreau\n\nMoreau, Jean Victor (1763 - 1813)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGeneral de Division 1794, General de Brigade 1794, Lieutenant Colonel 1791, Captain 1789\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nMilitary Advisor to Tsar Alexander in 1813 \"German War of Liberation\"\n\nCommanded Army of the Rhine 1800, won battles of Second Stockach, Moskirch, Ulm, Hochstadt, and most famously - Hohenlinden.\n\nCommanded Army of Italy in 1799, defeated by Suverov at battle of Cassano\n\nCommanded Army of Rhine and Moselle in 1796, fought battles of Ettlingen (Malsch) and Friedberg\n\nCommanded Army of the North in 1795\n\nIn 1794 fought in battles of Moscroen, Tourcoing and Nijmegan.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nMoreau's military reputation rivaled Napoleon's. In particular his 1800 victory against the Austrians at Hohenlinden threatened to overshadow Napoleon's efforts in Italy. Perhaps this explains Napoleon's efforts to 'improve' on the history of the battle of Marango. Moreau spent the years 1804 to 1813 exiled to the United States. He died after being hit by a French cannonball at Dresden in 1813. He was with the Allies at the time serving as military advisor to Tsar Alexander. The consensus seems to be that his political talents did not match his military ones.\n\nHoche\n\nHoche, Louis Lazare (1768 - 1797)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGeneral de Division 1793, General de Brigade 1793, Captain 1792, Sergeant in National Guard 1789, Enlisted Royal Guards 1784\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Army of Sambre and Meuse 1797, fought battles of Allenkirchen and Neuwied\n\nCommanded 1796 Expedition to Bantry Bay in support of Irish Rebellion\n\nIn July 1795 defeated emigre landing at Quiberon Bay\n\nCommanded Army of Brest 1794-1795 in suppressing Vendee rebellion\n\nCommanded Army of Moselle in 1793 battles of Kaiserlautern, Froschwiller and Geisberg\n\nIn Summary:\n\nOne of the most outstanding French Revolutionary Generals. If Hoche had not died of chest disease in 1797 he would have been a serious potential rival to Napoleon.\n\nDumouriez\n\nDumouriez, Charles Francois (1739 - 1823)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nForeign Minister Girondist government of 1792, Elected National Convention, Joined National Guard 1789, Governor naval base at Cherbourg, Major-General 1788, Joined French Royal cavalry 1758\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded French at battle of Neerwinden 1793\n\nCommanded French at battle of Jemappes 1792\n\nLed invasion of Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) 1792\n\nCommanded detachment from Army of the North at Valmy 1792\n\nIn Summary:\n\nDumouriez was an outstanding French Revolutionary General. He led a large detachment from his Army of the North to reinforce Kellerman's Army of the Center at Valmy and many sources consider him the French co-commander at that battle and partly or largely responsible for the French victory there. He successfully followed up Valmy with an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands defeating the Austrians at Jemappes. Fearing for his life after his defeat at Neerwinden the year afterwards he defected to the Allies.\n\nAustrian Military Leaders\n\nArchduke Charles, Beaulieu, Chastler, F. Colleredo, H.

Made mistakes that eased Napoleon's difficulties but likely never had a chance.\n\nChasteler\n\nChasteler de Courcelles, Johann, Marquis (1763 - 1825)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nFeldzeugmeister (eq.

His performance in the field proved respectable.\n\nF. Colloredo\n\nColloredo, Franz, Count von (1731 - 1807)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nIn Summary:\n\nConservative opposed to all reform including those proposed by Archduke Charles.

In the estimation of Clauswitz who knew him from these years he was \"distinguished for bravery and military talent.\"\n\nBulow\n\nvon Bulow, General Friedrich Wilhelm (1755 - 1816)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nFull General of Infantry 1814, Made Count (Graf von Dennewitz) 1813, Iron Crosses 1st and 2nd class 1813, Oak Leaves to Pour le Merit 1813, Lieutenant General 1813, Major General 1808, Colonel 1807, Pour le Merit 1794, Captain 1793, Lieutenant 1773, Cadet 1772, Enlisted 1768\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Prussian IV Corps that attacked French flank around Plancenoit at battle of Waterloo 1815\n\nFought at Laon in 1814\n\nImportant role at Leipzig in 1813\n\nWon critical battles of Gross-Beeren and Dennewitz defending Berlin in 1813\n\nCommanded Prussians in actions at Zehdenick and Lucknau in 1813\n\nIn brigade command in 1808\n\nCommanded regiment in 1807\n\nSaw continuous action in the years 1793 to 1794 winning Pour le Merit at seige of Mainz\n\nIn Summary:\n\nLike the 1813 campaign in Saxony in general the importance of Bulow's defense in front of Berlin in that year doesn't get the recognition in English language sources that it should. His appearance on the French flank at Waterloo was also critical and that is now beginning to be acknowledged.\n\nHohenlohe\n\nHohenlohe-Ingelfingen, Friedrich Ludwig, Prince (1746 - 1818)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGeneral of Infantry by 1806, Governor of Berlin 1791, Major-General 1786, Colonel 1778, Lieutenant-Colonel 1775, joined Prussian Army as major 1768.\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nLed the Prussian forces at Jena 1806\n\nCommanded Corps in Prussian Army of the Rhine 1794\n\nParticipated in War of Bavarian Succession 1778\n\nEntered Prussian Army 1767\n\nServed against Prussians last part of Seven Years War (which ended 1763)\n\nIn Summary:\n\nPersonally brave and at least competant with regards to traditional military tactics, Hohenlohe was very popular in the Prussian Army. His severe defeat at Jena and surrender three weeks later were severe blows to Prussian morale. It should be noted he was not just facing Napoleon at Jena but was also badly outnumbered.\n\nKliest\n\nKliest, Friedrich Heinrich Ferdinand Emil, Graf (Count) von Nollendorf (1762 - 1823)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGeneral of Infantry 1814, Lieutenant-General by 1813, Major 1799, joined Prussian infantry regiment at age 15 in 1778.\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nDefeated Napoleon at Laon 1814\n\nParticipated in French campaign 1814\n\nCorp commander at Bautzen, Dresden, Kulmn and Leipzig 1813\n\nFought in campaign of 1806, surrendering 20,000 men in Madgeburg after the Jena disaster\n\nFought in Revolutionary Wars\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThe \"Graf von Nollendorf\" was for his role in capturing Vandamme's Corps at Kulmn. As a junior and middle ranking officer von Kliest seems to have had mostly postings on the staff or as adjudant to very high ranking officers. He first appears in independant command in 1806 when he held then surrendered Magdeburg to the French along with a large portion of the remaining Prussian Army. Along with Blucher, Yorck, and von Bulow he was a key figure in the Prussian high command in the years 1813 and 1814. Kliest was responsible for the defence of Leipzig in the spring as well as fighting there during the fall at the Battle of Nations.\n\nHessen-Homburg\n\nHessen-Homburg, Ludwig Wilhelm, Prince (1770 - 1839)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nLieutenant-General, Major-General by 1813,\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded von Bulow's 3rd Brigade at Leipzig (battle of nations) 1813\n\nCommanded von Bulow's 3rd Brigade at Gross-Beeren and Dennewitz 1813\n\nCommanded the main body of von Bulow's Corps at Mockern April 1813\n\nIn Summary:\n\nOne of a large family of high ranking officers, four of them in Austrian service and a younger brother (Prince Leopold) who died at Lutzen(Grossgorschen). The Prussian Prince Ludwig was the junior of the two Hessen-Homburgs who fought on the Allied side in the Battle of Nations at Leipzig. The senior Hessen-Homburg (Prince Friedrich) was an Austrian general who also had a prominent part in the 1814 campaign leading an independant command against Augereau.\n\nTauentzien\n\nTauentzein, Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel, Graf von Wittenberg (1760 - 1824)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nGrand Cross of the Iron Cross 1814, General of Infantry 1813, Lieutenant-General 1807, Major-General 1801, Colonel 1795, Major 1790, joined Prussian Army 1775.\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nFought at Leipzig (Battle of Nations) 1813\n\nFought at Gross-Beeren and Dennewitz 1813\n\nCommanded IV Infantry Corps fall 1813\n\nBesieged Stettin spring 1813\n\nFought at Jena, commanding Hohenlohe's center corps that took the brunt of the battle 1806\n\nIn Summary:\n\nShared fully in both the disaster of 1806 and 1813's revenge.\n\nThielmann\n\nThielmann, Johann Adolf, Freiherr von (1765 - 1824)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nLieutenant General 1810, Major General 1810, Free Corps Colonel 1809, Entered Saxon cavalry 1782,\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded Prussians at Wavre in 1815\n\nCommanded Prussian III Corps at Ligny in 1815\n\nCommanded Saxon Corps in Low Countries in 1814\n\nCommanded Saxon division garrisoning Torgau which defected to Allies in May 1813\n\nFought at Borodino 1813\n\nLed Saxon cavalry brigade in French Grande Armee during Russian Campaign 1812\n\nAs commander of Free Corps opposed Austrian advance into Saxony 1809\n\nFought at Friedland\n\nFought at seige of Danzig\n\nIn Summary:\n\nAppears to have been a competant officer.

Paget, Picton, Pakenham, Hope, Hill, Stewart, Stuart,\n\nWellington\n\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769 - 1852)\n\nRanks and Titles:\n\nDuke of Wellington 1814, Field Marshall 1813, Generalissmo of the Spanish Armies 1812, Earl 1812, Viscount Douro 1811, Lieutenant General 1808, Major General 1802, Governor of Seringapatum 1799, Lieutenant-Colonel commanding 33rd Foot 1793, Major 33rd Foot 1793, Captain 1791, MP for Trim 1790-1795, Lieutenant 76th Regt 1787, Ensign 73rd Regt 1787\n\nSelected Campaigns and Battles:\n\nCommanded British in Netherlands 1815, commanding at Quartre-Bras and Waterloo\n\nCommanded at battles of Sorauren, Bidossa, Vera, Vivelle and the Nive in 1813\n\nCommanded at battle of Vitoria 1813\n\nCommanded at battle of Salamanca and attempt on Burgos 1812\n\nCommanded at taking of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz in spring 1812\n\nCommanded at battle of Bussaco 1810\n\nCommanded at battle of Talavera 1809\n\nCommanded at battle of Oporto 1809\n\nFull command in Peninsula 1809-1813\n\nFirst expedition to Portugal 1808, commanded at Vimeiro\n\nCommanded division in Copenhagen expedition 1807, commanded at Kjoge(Roskilde)\n\nCommanded brigade in southeast England 1805-1807\n\nCommanded battles of Assaye, and Argaum against Marathas 1803\n\nCommanded division in invasion of Mysore 1799\n\nCommanded expedition 1798\n\nIn Madras 1798\n\nIn Bengal 1797\n\nIn India 1797-1805\n\nCommanded 33rd Foot in Netherlands 1794-1795 fighting at Boxtel in 1794\n\nIn Summary:\n\nExtremely skilled general, a clear m"
