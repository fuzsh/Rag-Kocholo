I would like to begin with my friend and mentor John A. Lynn II. I owe John a debt of gratitude that I can never repay. Without him, neither this book nor my academic career would have been possible. John has always been willing to make time to help me in any manner that he could. He kindly agreed to read this book in its many incarnations and never failed to provide valuable advice that improved it considerably. I also particularly admire John’s magnanimity. This book begins by challenging the historical interpretation of military motivation under Napoleon formulated by John himself. Academics often have prickly egos, and most do not welcome critiques of their scholarship, including those advanced by their former graduate students. John, however, supported this project from beginning to end in every conceivable way, and showed a professionalism and a generosity that I try to emulate in my own career. Finally, I would like to thank him most of all for his humanity. When I found myself questioning my decision to pursue a Ph.D. in history, and experienced some personal losses late in my graduate career, John gave me the encouragement that I needed to continue, and had the patience and compassion to let me proceed at my own pace. Next, I would like to thank Clare H. Crowston, who has had a profound impact on my development as a scholar. More than anyone else, she taught me the value of gender history, which transformed my original research project into a vastly different, and much better, book. The intellectual sophistication that Clare so effortlessly displays has also inspired me to follow her example in my own professional endeavors. In addition, I was fortunate enough to begin my career as a historian under the late Russell F. Weigley. From him, I learned the important lesson that war and combat are an integral part of military history. Others provided crucial assistance by reading and critiquing different chapters in this book. I am especially thankful for the help of Alan Forrest, who aided me at different stages of this project, and Philip Dwyer, whose |\n\nix\n\nsuggestions and generous support played a central role in its publication. This book has also benefited from the contributions of Jeremy Black, Sam A. Mustafa, Charles Esdaile, Kenneth M. Cuno, and Mark Grimsley. Furthermore, the knowledge and expertise of Frederick C. Schneid and Eman M. Vovsi proved essential for catching and correcting factual errors. In France, I need to thank Jean-Paul Bertaud, who helped me to secure funding for my research and generously offered me his time, his contacts, and his knowledge of document collections in Paris. I am also grateful to Gilbert Bodinier, Bernard Gainot, Christian Schneider, Laurent Henninger, Jean-Marie Linsolas, and Chantal Lheureux-Prévot for their assistance with my research and for enriching my time in France. Moreover, this book could not have been written without the aid of the staff of the Archives de la guerre (which are now the Archives de l’armée de terre), or a Chateaubriand fellowship granted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Closer to home, I am very appreciative of my wonderful colleagues in the History Department at Iona College. They spared me from teaching new courses and from administrative duties by shouldering these burdens themselves, and gave me the time that I, as a junior faculty member, so desperately needed to write this book. I must also say a special thanks to Ed Helmrich and the rest of the staff at Ryan Library, who tracked down any source that I needed. I was equally fortunate to work with extraordinary people at New York University Press. The series editor, Wayne E. Lee, has been a firm supporter of this project from the start, and gave me useful commentary on the manuscript that made this a stronger book. Above all, I would like to thank my editor, Deborah Gershenowitz. Ever cheerful, Debbie was always available to provide advice, information, and encouragement, and she made writing this book much easier. I am likewise grateful for the help of her pleasant and professional assistant, Gabrielle Begue. I want to close by thanking my family. My parents, Joseph R. Hughes and Marilyn G. Hughes, contributed to this book in numerous ways. They were a constant source of love and support, both emotional and financial. No matter where my career happened to take me, they were eager to visit, whether it was Philadelphia, New York, Paris, or even more exotic east-central Illinois. Finally, I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my beloved wife, Beatriz Martin-Ruiz. In many ways, this book is her victory as much as it is mine. Like the intrepid cantinières who followed their husbands in Napoleon’s armies across Europe, she accompanied me on every step of the long journey to publishing it. She too has suffered and sacrificed much along the way, leaving her remarkable family in Spain to marry an American obsessed with x\n\n| Acknowledgments\n\nFrench history who abandoned her on countless days, nights, and weekends to write. Considering that the Frenchmen whom I study probably fought and killed some of her ancestors, my wife’s devotion is even more commendable. Her love, patience, and support have given me the ability to complete this project, and I lack the words to fully express my appreciation. For now, I will simply say, Bea, I love you, thank you for making this accomplishment possible, and I’m so incredibly lucky that you’re here to share it with me. Some of the material in this book will be published in Michael J. Hughes, “Images of the Grognard: Songs, French Soldiers, and Military Culture in the Armies of Napoleon,” Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, Selected Papers 2003. This book also contains material that will be published in Michael J. Hughes, “Celebrating the Grande Armée: Military Motivation and National Identity in the Armies of Napoleon,” Consortium on the Revolutionary Era, Selected Papers 2009. Furthermore, some of the material in this book appeared in Michael J. Hughes, “Making Frenchmen into Warriors: Martial Masculinity in Napoleonic France,” in Christopher E. Forth and Bertrand Taithe, eds., French Masculinities: History, Culture, and Politics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007). This material has been reproduced with the permission of Palgrave Macmillan. There are a few final intellectual debts to honor that I was unable to properly acknowledge elsewhere before this book went to press. My descriptions of the start of the Napoleonic wars, the diplomatic maneuvers involved, and the creation of the French Empire were strongly influenced by the works of Steven Englund, Frederick C. Scheid, and Isser Woloch. In addition, the information in this book about the French army under the Directory and its loyalty to generals other than Napoleon during the Consulate comes from Jean-Paul Bertaud and Gilbert Bodinier. Lastly, this study relies on statistical information about army sizes, unit strengths, and battle casualties from books by David G. Chandler, Scott Bowden, and Robert Goetz. Unless the notes specify otherwise, the figures contained in the following pages are drawn from them. The publications of all these individuals are listed in the bibliography.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n|\n\nxi\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction Military Culture and Motivation in the Armies of Napoleon\n\nFrançois-Joseph Zickel served as a cavalry officer in the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte, and his long military career spanned the entire period of the Napoleonic wars. Zickel was born the son of a soldier, and from a young age he eagerly desired to follow in his father’s footsteps. In the heady days of 1791, as Revolutionary France prepared its defenses, he enlisted in one of the new local guard units that were formed to supplement the regiments of the former Royal army. With popular support for the Revolution still in the ascendant, men from all over France volunteered for military service. Zickel, however, was unusual because he was only twelve years old. Two years later, he went a step further and joined a battalion headed to the front lines. Upon his arrival at the Armée du Nord, the military authorities discovered his age and promptly sent him home. Despite this setback, Zickel maintained his enthusiasm for the profession of arms. When he was finally old enough, he entered the 10th regiment of chasseurs à cheval, a unit of light cavalry. He was then nineteen, and the year was 1798. For the next fifteen years, Zickel had a remarkable military career. After several years as a noncommissioned officer (NCO), he was promoted to second lieutenant, a commissioned rank, in 1807. He fought under General André Masséna at the second battle of Zurich in 1799, participated in the capture of Ulm in 1805, charged with French cavalry at Jena in 1806, served in Spain during the disastrous Peninsular War, and took part in the defense of France in 1814. Although he fought in several major engagements, he miraculously managed to survive the Napoleonic wars. Yet while he dreamed of rising through the ranks like countless others, possessed years of experience, and was devoted to Napoleon, he never rose above the rank of second lieutenant.1 It is possible to reconstruct Zickel’s career through a series of letters that he wrote to his father. These letters reveal the officer’s feelings about war |\n\n1\n\nand his military service, and illustrate the ways in which his motivation and political values changed over time. When he legally entered the army in 1798, Zickel had lost none of the Revolutionary ardor that inspired him to volunteer for the military as a boy of twelve. Following his description of the fighting around Zurich, he defiantly exclaimed, “Thus, vive la République [long live the Republic] forever one and indivisible, and death to tyrants!”2 Ten years later, Zickel showed the same enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France. After the French victory at Ocaña, Spain, in 1809, he proudly reported to his father, “Thus the loss of the enemy could amount to 40,000 men! Vive l’Empereur! [Long live the Emperor!]”3 What an astonishing transformation! Here we have a French officer who began his career as a dedicated Republican patriot expressing devotion to a hereditary monarch whose power was more absolute than that of any of the supposedly Absolutist kings of the Old Regime. Moreover, this monarch invaded and conquered a sovereign country, forced its rightful rulers to abdicate, and made his brother its king by force of arms. Such acts resembled those of the very tyrants whose deaths Zickel had professed to desire a decade earlier. The purpose of this book is to ascertain how and why this shift in attitudes occurred. It attempts to explain why Zickel and other French soldiers, who came from a France that shed so much blood and spent so much treasure to preserve the ideals of the French Revolution, fought so hard and so well under Napoleon and continued to give their lives year after year to expand the empire that he established. To accomplish this task, this study examines the military culture created by the Napoleonic regime to influence its troops, and its impact on the Frenchmen who served in the armies of the Consulate (1799-1804) and the First French Empire (1804-1814). In pursuit of these endeavors, the book examines cultural phenomena and concepts of masculinity that affected the military performance of soldiers like François-Joseph Zickel but that have been neglected or misunderstood. The product of these phenomena was an intricate motivational system that convinced French officers and enlisted men to wage war for a variety of compelling reasons. The motivation of Napoleon’s troops is not a new subject to historians. There is an enormous body of literature on the military history of the Napoleonic wars, and scholars have written about Napoleon’s morale-building techniques and their effects on the French army since the early nineteenth century.4 The standard interpretation on this topic in Anglo-American historiography can be characterized as the “army of honor” thesis, and was developed by John A. Lynn.5 Lynn proposes that Napoleon, who was hostile to the Revolution, changed the French army from an “army of virtue” into an 2\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\n“army of honor.” According to Lynn, the French Revolutionaries created an army of citizen soldiers whose primary source of military motivation was the concept of Revolutionary virtue. Revolutionary virtue was devotion to the common good and the willingness to sacrifice personal interests, including one’s life and well-being, to serve the collective needs of society and the nation. Maximilien Robespierre and other committed revolutionaries inculcated this ideal in the army as part of their efforts to transform France into a “Republic of Virtue” during the Terror. Lynn argues that Napoleon replaced virtue with honor as the driving force in the French army. Drawing upon the political theories of Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, he defines honor as the desire for prestige and status that was traditionally associated with the French aristocracy, and the exercise of absolute monarchy in the Old Regime. Montesquieu explained that aristocratic honor was the mechanism that allowed monarchy to function. To acquire the services of their proud nobles, French kings like Louis XIV offered them rewards, or “honors,” such as positions in the government, titles, and medals like the badge of the Order of Saint Louis. In return, the nobles, Montesquieu claimed, performed actions that furthered the interests of the monarchy to obtain the king’s honors. They did so because their sense of honor, their personal need to uphold their reputation, compelled them to win royal rewards and the increased status that they conveyed. The distribution of honors thus allowed French kings to manipulate aristocratic honor and harness it to the goals of the monarchy. Lynn contends that Napoleon, who wished to become an absolute monarch, imitated his Bourbon predecessors. He argues that the former Revolutionary general cultivated aristocratic forms of honor among his soldiers by creating a system of symbolic and material rewards such as promotions, the Legion of Honor, and titles of nobility. The purpose of these awards was to produce soldiers who valued individual prestige over the common good, and who owed their loyalties to the source of the rewards, Napoleon himself, instead of the French people, the Republic, or the nation. Together, these solders constituted an army of honor that provided Napoleon with the perfect instrument to achieve his imperial ambitions. Implying that Napoleon betrayed the Revolution, Lynn insists that he replaced the Revolution’s admirable emphasis on self-sacrifice with the self-interested desire for personal fame and aggrandizement. In his words, Napoleon “wished to appeal to the French love of honor in lieu of other affections, such as that for liberty.”6 These arguments were presented as a proposal to encourage further debate and inquiry, but despite Lynn’s intentions, they have taken on a life Introduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\nof their own to dominate Napoleonic military history. The bicentennial of Napoleon’s reign, which is still taking place, inspired a new wave of scholarship that reinforces, modifies, and challenges the army-of-honor thesis. Long neglected by nonmilitary historians, the Napoleonic wars have been rediscovered by scholars in other fields, and the study of them is experiencing something of a renaissance. One of the causes underlying this trend is the renewed interest in the Napoleonic period generated by the bicentennial. Perhaps just as important, Western historians appear to be discovering a new appreciation for the centrality of war in human history due to the military conflicts provoked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As a result of these developments, historians in the United States and Europe increasingly recognize the Napoleonic wars as a pivotal event in the emergence of the modern world, and are producing innovative studies that reevaluate the nature, meaning, and impact of Napoleon’s reign and his wars on France and Europe. In this body of literature, the most important English-language work on Napoleon’s soldiers was written by Alan Forrest.7 Forrest modifies the armyof-honor thesis by emphasizing more continuity in the moral evolution of the army. He maintains that professionalism was more advanced in the Revolutionary armies and that patriotism was present to a greater extent in the armies of Napoleon than Lynn proposes. However, Forrest accepts Lynn’s basic theory, and characterizes the French army of the Napoleonic wars as an army of honor.8 Although he claims that Revolutionary forms of patriotism existed among the soldiers of both the Republic and the Empire, especially in the initial stages of their military service, he argues that this commitment to the national cause was transformed into professional pride in the army, the desire for personal rewards, and devotion to the emperor. Similar to other proponents of the army-of-honor thesis, Forrest also attributes the army’s loyalty to Napoleon to his personal charisma and talents, his ability to relate to his troops, and the awards that he offered to them. While Forrest discusses military motivation, it is not the primary focus of his book. He seeks to reveal the thoughts, emotions, and experiences of French troops during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. The point of this endeavor is to compare the men who emerge from his sources with the heroic images of the French soldier in Napoleonic propaganda, and to challenge the myths about Napoleon’s men that have persisted until the present day. Forrest succeeds admirably in these tasks. Unlike the existing literature on Revolutionary and Napoleonic soldiers, which relies mainly on secondary works and soldiers’ memoirs that were composed decades after 1815, he uses 4\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\na large collection of letters and diaries written by French troops during their military service. Analyzing these documents, many of which are housed in departmental archives, Forrest argues that real French soldiers contrasted sharply with representations of them in official discourse as patriotic and warlike supermen. He claims that save for a small minority of officers and NCOs, Napoleon’s men generally disliked military life and were usually afraid, depressed, homesick, and eager for peace. Moreover, the Empire’s ceaseless wars and the suffering that they caused gradually eroded whatever enthusiasm for war or military service its soldiers might have possessed. Natalie Petiteau’s depiction of Napoleon’s troops resembles that of Forrest. In her studies on French soldiers and veterans of the Napoleonic wars, she attempts to shatter the myths about them that emerged in the nineteenth century and explain how the veterans contributed to the construction of French national identity.9 Popular legends surrounding the veterans and most historical literature portrayed them as fanatics devoted to the emperor and the French nation. After they were forcibly discharged from the army and became demi-soldes, this fanaticism led them to plot constantly to restore Napoleon and his dynasty to power.10 After examining the lives, careers, and political activities of French veterans during and after the Napoleonic wars, Petiteau concludes that they did not conform to the model of the disgruntled, Bonapartist grognard. The term “grognard” meant “grumbler” or “complainer.” Originally, it referred to the infantry of the Imperial Guard, but it later evolved into a popular nickname that was applied more generally to all of Napoleon’s soldiers. According to Petiteau, veterans, except for an active and vocal minority, reintegrated into civilian society and refrained from political activities. Most of them acquired a sense of national identity, group solidarity, and Bonapartist political sympathies in the decades after their service in the army. Like Forrest, she recognizes that many French soldiers possessed tremendous admiration and affection for Napoleon because they perceived him as a great man, a hero and a genius who could accomplish the impossible. She also proposes that some of them internalized the military values of the army and were seduced by martial glory. Others forged strong bonds within their regiment, which became a surrogate family and sustained them through the harrowing ordeal of the Napoleonic wars. Yet, challenging the army-of-honor thesis, Petiteau asserts that one of the principal sources of military motivation in Napoleon’s armies was a “spirit of submission.” Comparing their troops to the poilus of World War I, she claims that a “culture of obedience” in France inculcated subordination to familial, social, and political authorities.11 While some French men developed a desire for glory and Introduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\npatriotism in the army, and many soldiers had a strong attachment to Napoleon and their units, most were reluctant conscripts who waged war because they were habituated to following the dictates of their parents and the state. The distinguished French historian, Jean-Paul Bertaud, presents similar arguments about the motivation, or lack thereof, of the common soldiers of the First Empire. Bertaud’s most recent book investigates the role of the French army in the militarization of Napoleonic France.12 In it, he portrays the enlisted men of the Consulate and the Empire as victims of the Napoleonic regime, declaring that historians have tended to view relations between Napoleon and his soldiers through the myths of the Napoleonic legend. He claims that only “the reckless, young volunteers obsessed with adventure and glory” and “memorialists quick to embellish everything” possessed a passion for war. Once the novelty of military life wore off, fear, despair, and resignation characterized the sentiments of the majority of the grognards. Bertaud even suggests that the enthusiasm they displayed on the battlefield was due to drunkenness as much as any alleged “national gaiety.”13 Though he does not engage Lynn’s work directly or explicitly, Bertaud also disputes the army-of-honor thesis. In contrast to Lynn, who believes that Napoleon betrayed the French Revolution, Bertaud situates his reign and his armies within the broader framework of the Revolutionary era. He recognizes that Napoleon wanted new conquests to establish his political legitimacy, acquire personal glory, and secure his place in the historical record. However, he also proposes that the Empire’s wars were driven by a vision of the French nation developed during the Revolution. Napoleon and his supporters, Bertaud maintains, continued to regard France as la Grande Nation, or “the Great Nation.” The concept of the Great Nation identified France as the premier nation in Europe and the pinnacle of civilization. Moreover, this nation possessed an obligation to bring the rights of man, civil equality, and the principle of national sovereignty to the oppressed peoples of Europe. Bertaud contends that the Napoleonic regime inherited these ideas and used them to launch a new crusade. This struggle was a war to preserve the hegemony of the Great Nation, uphold its honor, and spread the benefits of the Revolution and French civilization to the rest of Europe. The conflict was also a battle between good and evil in which Napoleon, who embodied the Great Nation, was defending France and civilization itself from the barbaric and treacherous English. Bertaud demonstrates that Napoleon and his supporters continuously sought to enlist the French people and the French army in this crusade. They assembled a vast array of propaganda and rewards, and mobilized the 6\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\neducational system, the arts, and established churches to convince French men to commit themselves to the cause of the Great Nation. Honor, Bertaud explains, constituted an essential component of this program. Like Lynn, he maintains that honor was the principal attribute of the French army during the Napoleonic wars, and that Napoleon deliberately employed it as an instrument of military motivation. Yet Bertaud insists that Napoleonic honor differed fundamentally from the aristocratic honor of the Old Regime. In the crucible of the Revolution, traditional concepts of honor combined with Revolutionary virtue in the French army to forge a new form of honor. This new honor preserved the nobility’s need to demonstrate physical courage and loyalty, command respect, and protect the weak, but it rejected the selfinterest that had defined Old Regime honor. According to Bertaud, Napoleonic honor identified honor with service to the nation and the honor of the nation. Individuals and groups could only acquire status and prestige through acts that contributed to the common good. Virtue thus became honor during the Consulate and the Empire. Furthermore, Bertaud claims, Napoleon was not content to promote honor in the army. He institutionalized the military’s virtuous honor through the Legion of Honor, and held the army up as a model for civilian society in order to cultivate it in the general population. Bertaud therefore concurs that the French army evolved into an army of honor during the Napoleonic era, but argues that it possessed a motivational system that conserved revolutionary virtue in a modified form and required devotion to the revolutionary Great Nation. For him, Napoleon’s army resembled the military forces of the French Revolution far more than it did those of the Old Regime. The works reviewed thus far have dramatically expanded our knowledge of Napoleon’s soldiers, their values and motivations, and the relationship among war, political culture, and nationalism in Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. This book benefits greatly from these studies, but it also goes beyond them by combining military history with the analysis of culture and gender. There is still a need for further inquiry into the subject of military motivation in the armies of Napoleon. Recent monographs like those of Forrest, Petiteau, and Bertaud succeed in challenging many of the myths surrounding the grognards. Yet, in replacing the enthusiastic, patriotic, glory-obsessed, and emperor-worshiping French soldier with the resigned, unenthusiastic, and homesick conscript, they fail to offer a satisfactory explanation for the outstanding military performance of Napoleon’s armies. After reading their work, one is left wondering how an army composed of such troops could repeatedly defeat the highly trained, professional forces of their Introduction\n\n|\n\n7\n\nopponents on the battlefield, and continue to wage war year after year even as France’s enemies continued to multiply and the prospect of peace became increasingly remote. In addition, military motivation is a complex phenomenon that is produced by the interaction of numerous factors. One of the foundations of any system of military motivation is the military culture existing in an army. The historical literature on Napoleon’s armies, however, refrains from fully investigating the military culture created inside of the armies of the Consulate and the Empire. Existing studies often base their interpretations on the rewards offered to the army and neglect the cultural context in which they were distributed.14 Others draw conclusions from propaganda such as high art, monuments, and novels intended mainly for the civilian population that the vast majority of Napoleon’s troops never saw or experienced.15 Works that analyze the mentalities of the grognards tend to concentrate on their writings and experiences without exploring the environment of the army that surrounded them.16 These omissions are important because it necessary to understand the relationship between the attitudes of French soldiers and the military culture in which they were immersed to ascertain how motivation functioned in Napoleon’s armies. The meanings of rewards or references in the writings of French troops may remain obscure or be misunderstood unless the cultural framework that enveloped them is studied. Furthermore, the Napoleonic regime deliberately tried to isolate the army from the civilian population, and the army spent most of the Napoleonic wars away from France. It was usually abroad conducting new campaigns or garrisoned in the territories that it conquered. Consequently, the military culture of the army differed from the more general culture of war that Napoleon and his supporters constructed in France. Another lacuna in the military history of Napoleonic France is the absence of gender analyses. Gender history attempts to trace the evolution of gender identities created around biological sex differences, and to analyze the role of these identities in historical developments. Put more simply, gender historians study ideas and practices related to femininity, masculinity, and transgender identities, and try to determine how they affected history.17 Prominent scholars in the fields of gender studies, women’s history, and military history have recognized that war and gender are intimately connected, and have challenged historians to discover the ways in which they intersect and shape one another. Responding to this challenge, increasing numbers of historical studies explore the relationship among war, military institutions, masculinity, and femininity.18 8\n\n| Introduction\n\nIn the history of the Napoleonic era, however, relatively little work has been done on this subject. Well-known historians of masculinity such as Robert A. Nye and George L. Mosse characterize the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars as a formative period in the history of modern masculinity in which the concept of the citizen soldier came to define manhood in the West. Yet, their own research generally concentrates on the forms of masculinity that emerged in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and does not adequately explain how this change occurred.19 Karen Hagemann’s pioneering research reveals the ways in which gender influenced Prussian participation in the Napoleonic wars, and the effects of these conflicts on German masculinity.20 Yet, a comparable study of Napoleonic France does not exist. The feminist historians who have done so much to enhance our knowledge of the French Revolution and Napoleonic France through gender history generally ignore military topics.21 For their part, historians who have written about Napoleon’s soldiers and military campaigns neglect the role of gender in the French war effort. While many military historians remain uncomfortable with gender history, attitudes and behaviors related to masculinity form an essential component of military culture and military motivation. Throughout history, men performed their military obligations in and out of combat because they tried to conform to accepted standards of male behavior in their military forces or society at large. Illustrating this tendency, a study conducted by the United States military on the battlefield performance of American soldiers in World War II reported that “the code of the combat soldier can be summarized by saying that behavior in combat was recognized as a test of being a man. When this code was internalized, or enforced by playing on an internalized code of manliness, a man once in combat had to fight in order to keep his own self-respect: ‘Hell, I’m a soldier.’”22 Although manhood in the West has often been associated with the ability to wage war, masculine norms, of course, varied across time periods, cultures, societies, and military forces. For example, the wigs, lace, and hose worn by the aristocratic military officers of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, and the elegant manners that they cultivated, would probably be regarded as effeminate by the American soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today. It is the obligation of the historian to analyze these differences, and explore their effects on war, military forces, and the development of masculinity. To understand the motivation of Napoleon’s soldiers, it is therefore imperative to discover the forms of manhood that existed in the armies of the Consulate and the Empire, and their impact on French troops. Introduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\nThis book fulfills this task by engaging in a thorough analysis of the motivational system developed in three different armies: the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée of 1805-1808. Napoleon assembled the first two armies in 1803 to strike at England after the collapse of the Peace of Amiens. The Grande Armée was formed out of the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean and the Army of Hanover once a general European war began in 1805, known as the War of the Third Coalition. These armies are historically significant for two reasons. First, they reveal the ways in which Napoleon sought to alter the character of the army once he had established his political power in France. The first few years of the Consulate represent a transitional phase in which Napoleon shared power in the French state with political rivals, and in the military with powerful generals such as Jean Victor Moreau and Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte. By 1803, Napoleon was in firm control of both politics and the military, and possessed the opportunity to solidify his hold over the army. Secondly, these armies won Napoleon’s greatest and most important victories. In slightly less than three years, the Grande Armée crushed the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, and Russia in a series of rapid campaigns that were unprecedented in their speed and decisiveness. Even more significant, the victories of the Grande Armée allowed Napoleon to establish French hegemony in Europe through the Peace of Tilsit in 1807. In the words of one of the leading historians of Napoleon’s empire, “the Grande Army was the crucial instrument of French aggrandizement and . . . the victories of 1805-1807 opened the way to a process of continental empire-building which had not been practicable before.”23 Two conceptual models are used in this book to provide a framework for the study of these armies: sustaining motivation and military culture. The concept of sustaining motivation was first developed by John A. Lynn in his work on the armies of the French Revolution.24 Sustaining motivation is different from initial motivation and combat motivation. Initial motivation concerns the reasons why individuals enlist in the military. Combat motivation can be defined as the collection of factors that cause individuals to fight in battle. Sustaining motivation, on the other hand, consists of the motives and precombat experiences that provide individuals with the moral fortitude or compulsion to remain in military service. Put more simply, it is what keeps men, and sometimes women, in the ranks and brings them to battle. As Lynn explains, “the range of behavior influenced by sustaining motivation runs from cheerful and energetic acceptance of duty to surrender, desertion, or mutiny.”25 10\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis form of motivation, sustaining motivation, is the subject of this book. Of course, the boundaries between different types of military motivation remain far more fluid than the theoretical model indicates. Consequently, this study will also account for the ways in which the initial motivation of French soldiers shaped other kinds of motivation, and more importantly, reveal how the factors that influenced their sustaining motivation affected their performance in combat. To understand why Napoleon’s troops waged war, I examine the creation and reception of Napoleonic military culture. Military culture communicates the value systems, establishes the behavioral standards, and provides the rewards and punishments that sustain the motivation and morale of soldiers. In this book, military culture is defined as the set of ideas, values, and practices that guide thought and behavior in the armed forces of a given society. It is a form of institutional culture that is developed for and by military forces, and it is distinct from the more general culture of war that exists in different societies and cultures. Military culture is not a closed system, nor is it static. It evolves and changes as a result of relationships within military forces, and because of interactions between military institutions and factors external to them such as politics, foreign relations, socioeconomic structures, and technology. Elements of military culture include, but are not limited to, strategic thought, concepts of military discipline, the role of the army in the state and society, the official goals of the military, and behavioral norms for conduct prior to, during, and after combat.26 While military culture encompasses a wide variety of phenomena, this study will concentrate on the facets of this construct related to military motivation. Napoleonic military culture coalesced as the Consular and Imperial state developed a series of measures to secure the loyalty of French soldiers, and to persuade as well as pressure them to wage war for it. This military culture changed as it responded to historical events as well as the goals and actions of French soldiers. Most of the instruments employed by the Napoleonic regime to influence its soldiers might be considered propaganda. Yet, such efforts involved more than just propaganda. A difficult term to define, like “military culture,” “propaganda” implies the overt use of different types of media, whether aural, visual, or literary, to produce desired attitudes and behaviors. Napoleonic officials certainly engaged in these sorts of activities, but they also did more. They created other means to mold their soldiers, including the threat of punishment, symbolic actions such as oath taking, and practices like the circulation of petitions to Napoleon. Although somewhat imprecise, the concept of military culture offers a more useful analytical Introduction\n\n|\n\n11\n\ntool than that of propaganda to examine this complicated system of rewards, punishments, ideas, and activities, and the broader cultural framework that they were designed to fabricate. As cultural historians such as Roger Chartier have shown, we cannot simply assume that individuals in the past passively accepted the ideas and practices to which they were exposed. To borrow a metaphor from Chartier, human minds are not like soft wax that bears the imprint of whatever is inscribed upon it.27 Individuals and groups appropriate cultural forms in different ways for reasons that may diverge widely from the manner intended by those who formulated them. It is therefore necessary to analyze the ways in which French soldiers internalized Napoleonic military culture. Only by undertaking this kind of investigation is it possible to understand their motivation. Studying Napoleonic military culture and its appropriation in the Army of the Coasts, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée reveals a complex motivational framework. The characterization of Napoleon’s armies as an army of honor or as an instrument forged to continue the Great Nation’s Revolutionary crusade obscures the elaborate mixture of ideas, values, and practices operating within the military forces of the Consulate and the Empire. No one single attribute defined the armies of Napoleon. Rather, the Napoleonic regime incorporated elements of Old Regime and Revolutionary military culture into a new military culture linked to Napoleon’s rule and the preservation of French hegemony in Europe. Yet, this creation resembled a patchwork collage more than a seamless canvas in which the old merged harmoniously with the new. Napoleonic military culture employed five main sources of motivation: honor, patriotism, a martial and virile masculinity, devotion to Napoleon, and coercion. The French army did become an army of honor under Napoleon, but it possessed more than one form of honor. The virtuous honor described by Bertaud appeared side by side with more traditional forms of honor characterized by the acquisition of martial glory and esprit de corps. Patriotism in the armies of the Consulate and the Empire associated the honor of the soldier with the honor of the nation. However, instead of being portrayed as a beacon of freedom, enlightenment, and civilization, France emerged as a warrior nation that needed to maintain its prestige and position in Europe through military conquests. Napoleonic military culture transformed Revolutionary virtue into Imperial virtue, which committed French soldiers to defending the reputation of the French nation as well as its physi12\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\ncal existence. The aggressive, militaristic character of Napoleonic France was reinforced through the inculcation of a concept of masculinity that required the soldiers of the Consulate and the Empire to demonstrate their manhood through displays of martial and sexual prowess. The Napoleonic regime literally offered its troops sex as a reward for military service, and encouraged them to prove the superiority of the French nation through their feats of arms and their sexual conquests among foreign women. To establish loyalties to Napoleon, representations of the emperor implied that his victories provided them with access to female bodies beyond France. Yet, similar to honor, the Napoleonic regime presented different, and often contradictory, images of the French leader to his troops. Napoleon was portrayed as an Absolutist ruler who governed by divine right and dispensed honors to his loyal servants, and as a patriotic monarch whose sovereignty rested upon the will of the French people, his service to the nation, and his preservation of the French Revolution’s achievements. In addition, he was a Romantic military hero who shared the glory of his incomparable victories with his army. If loyalty to Napoleon, honor, patriotism, and martial masculinity failed to make an impression on reluctant recruits, the military authorities resorted to the threat of punishment. They repeatedly informed the soldiers in the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée about the harsh penalties for desertion, and forced them to witness the suffering and humiliation of those unfortunate enough to endure them. The multivalent character of Napoleonic military culture was one of the primary reasons why the French army was so successful during the first half of Napoleon’s reign. The Napoleonic regime offered its soldiers a variety of incentives that resonated with them, and in the process, produced determined armies with high morale that were superior to their European rivals. While Napoleonic military culture exercised a powerful influence over sustaining motivation in the French army, officers and enlisted men responded to it in different ways. The measures intended to shape the army had their greatest impact on the officer corps. Its members internalized the military culture in which they were immersed, and became true grognards, the kinds of soldiers who appeared in Napoleonic propaganda. Between 1803 and 1808, the lure of rewards, honor, and glory constituted the most important source of motivation for them. Yet, contrary to the assertions of historians who propose that the desire for honor increased over time, Napoleon’s officers displayed an intense commitment to France. Furthermore, in the later stages of the Napoleonic wars, their patriotism surpassed their passion for personal renown. Introduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\nA significant minority of the rank and file resembled their superiors and adopted the value system created in the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée. They possessed a cultlike attachment to their leader, but this devotion was not simply the product of the emperor’s victories, his personal interaction with his men, or rewards. Napoleon’s achievements and his ability to associate his rule with the traditions and ideals that defined political legitimacy in France allowed him to acquire a sacrality that inspired dedication to his person. He became the monarch that the French public had wanted since the middle of the eighteenth century, and his soldiers cherished him for it. Numerous NCOs and common soldiers also valued the glory that they obtained under his command, and appreciated the opportunities for female companionship and sexual encounters that the army provided. Many men in the enlisted ranks, however, regarded their military service with a sense of resignation and simply did what was required of them. Religious faith, prewar experiences, loyalty to their primary group, and the leadership of committed officers allowed them to endure the ordeal of war and transformed them into effective soldiers who triumphed over their opponents. The coercive apparatus put in place by the Napoleonic regime succeeded in motivating the rest by making them fear the consequences of desertion more than the risks of combat. These ideas are presented in seven chapters. The first chapter contains an overview of the history of the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée of 1805-1808. Afterward, it shows how Napoleon and his supporters constructed the military culture of these armies with different types of media, rewards, and symbolic activities. Chapter 2 examines the forms of honor cultivated in the army. The following chapter, chapter 3, concentrates on Napoleonic patriotism and demonstrates how Revolutionary virtue became Imperial virtue. The fourth chapter studies the efforts of the Napoleonic regime to manipulate French masculinity for military purposes, and its reliance on sex as a source of motivation. It also reveals the ways in which the promise of a libertine lifestyle and sexual conquests among foreign women contributed to the development of Imperial virtue. Chapter 5 then analyzes the representations of Napoleon communicated to the troops. The last two chapters assess the impact of Napoleonic military culture on the men who served in the Army of the Coasts, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée. Chapter 6 evaluates sustaining motivation in the officer corps. The final chapter explains why common soldiers fought for Napoleon, and investigates the use of coercion to compel unwilling recruits to perform their military duties. 14\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile this book is about armies and military motivation, it has implications that extend beyond the study of war and military institutions. The armies of Napoleon transformed Europe and, ultimately, the world, through their conquests. As a result of their military victories, the French occupied a substantial amount of territory in Europe. They exported the values and institutions of Revolutionary and Napoleonic France to conquered territories and allied states. In the process, they helped to bring about the modernization of Europe. Moreover, the First Empire provoked the development of new forms of nationalism as a response to French expansion and Napoleon’s oppressive conscription and tax policies. Because of the essential contributions made by French soldiers to these changes, it is critical to know more about why they fought, and therefore, the different factors that shaped their identities and perceptions of military service. Just as significant, more than a million Frenchmen served in the armies of Napoleon. The formative experiences of these men, many of whom survived the Napoleonic wars to become an important part of French society, occurred during the period of their military service. Former soldiers occupied prominent positions in the state and civil society in post-Napoleonic France, and poor ex-soldiers constituted a social and political group that was active in the political struggles that wracked France in the first half of the nineteenth century. Many former soldiers were simply reintegrated into civilian society. There, they formed a substantial part of the male population that lived, worked, had families, and participated in the lives of their communities. Studying these men as they were forged in the fires of war can therefore provide a lens through which to analyze the development of a large and influential sector of French society that did much to mold modern France.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n15\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland The Grande Armée and Napoleonic Military Culture\n\nAfter weeks of marching across France, the soldiers of the Grande Armée finally discovered the task that lay ahead. As the army’s formations advanced into Germany, they received a proclamation from Napoleon. Issued on September 29, 1805, it announced, “Soldiers, the War of the Third Coalition has begun. The Austrian Army has passed the Inn [River], violated treaties, attacked and driven our ally from his capital.” In response, the proclamation declared, the Grande Armée would fight to assure the independence of Germany, aid the allies of France, and destroy the “new league which the hatred and gold of England had fabricated.” It also reminded the troops that the emperor marched with them and that they were the “advanced guard of the Great People.” Asserting that they would overcome “any obstacles,” it concluded with the defiant vow, “we will not rest until we have planted our eagles on the territory of our enemies.”1 The proclamation proved prophetic. Over the next few months, the Grande Armée compelled an entire Habsburg army to surrender, captured Vienna, the capital of the Habsburg Empire, and dismantled the Third Coalition, along with the main Allied field army, at the battle of Austerlitz. The campaign of 1805 was noteworthy for a number of reasons, not the least of which was its rapid and decisive conclusion. It opened a new stage in the Napoleonic wars, inaugurating a period of French military success that culminated in the establishment of French hegemony in Europe. If the campaign of 1805 represents the start of a new era, the preparations for it began two years earlier when First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte began to build an army for an invasion of Great Britain. The army assembled to confront France’s most implacable foe never would set foot on English shores, but it |\n\n17\n\ndid become the Grande Armée and consistently defeated its opponents from 1805 to 1808. One of the primary sources of its success was a distinctive military culture developed by Napoleon and his supporters to sustain the motivation of France’s soldiers. After presenting a brief history of these armies, this chapter introduces the different forms of media and symbolic activities used to create their military culture to provide a context for the material presented in the rest of the book.\n\nThe Expedition to England and the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean The forging of the Grande Armée began with the end of the Peace of Amiens, which was signed between Britain and France in 1802. The treaty was especially significant because it established a general peace in Europe after almost ten years of continuous warfare provoked by the French Revolution. The ambitious new leader of France, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, perceived the respite as a chance to increase French power and influence abroad. Consequently, he refused to allow British goods free access to French markets, maintained French troops in the Netherlands in violation of earlier diplomatic agreements, added Piedmont and Elba to France, publicly contemplated reconquering Egypt, and pursued diplomatic initiatives in India. The British government understandably perceived these measures as provocations, and viewed French expansion in the Mediterranean with apprehension. For their part, the British retained Malta, which they had promised to vacate at Amiens, and their press savaged the first consul in print. Under these conditions, tensions quickly escalated, and hostilities between Britain and France resumed on May 18, 1803. To defeat “perfidious Albion,” Napoleon planned to undertake a new amphibious invasion of the British Isles. It would take time, however, to assemble the military forces needed to ensure the expedition’s success. The first consul therefore began the war by launching a campaign against British holdings on the Continent. The first major military operation was the invasion of the Electorate of Hanover, a British possession in Germany. In May of 1803, Napoleon ordered General Adolphe Edouard Casimir Joseph Mortier to march against Hanover with approximately fourteen thousand men. The French overran the Electorate and forced its army to surrender a few months later. Mortier’s army, the Army of Hanover, occupied the Electorate until September of 1805. General Jean-Baptiste-Jules Bernadotte arrived to take command in 1804, and the army’s size was expanded until it contained twenty-six thousand troops.2 18\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nWhile the French extended their control over Hanover, Napoleon built a much larger army for the invasion of England. In June of 1803, he issued instructions for the creation of an expeditionary force concentrated in six camps stretching from the south of France to the Netherlands. The sites originally chosen included Holland, Gand, Saint-Omer, Compiègne, Saint-Malo, and Bayonne. Some of these locations were discovered to be insuitable as staging areas for military operations against Britain. The first consul therefore adjusted his plans and assembled the new army in five main camps near Bayonne, Boulogne, Montreuil, Bruges in Belgium, and Utrecht in Holland. After the conclusion of successful diplomatic negotiations with Spain, Napoleon transferred the camp at Bayonne to Brest. The units in the Camp of Bruges also eventually relocated to Ambleteuse, a village a few miles from Boulogne. While these camps were identified with a particular city or town, they possessed so many troops that they tended to occupy a sizeable geographical area. The camp at Boulogne offers a good example. For most of its existence, its units were positioned at Boulogne, the neighboring town of Outreau, Ambleteuse, and the town of Wimereux. Altogether, the encampments extended for a nine-mile stretch along the coast. In addition to the principal army camps, there were also camps established at St. Omer, Amiens, Compiègne, Arras, and Paris for cavalry and reserve troops. French preparations for the assault on Britain gained momentum in the summer and fall of 1803 as troops and supplies streamed toward the camps. Napoleon christened the army to which they were headed the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean and established its headquarters at the Camp of St. Omer, the official name of the camp at Boulogne. The size of the Army of the Coasts, the more manageable title by which it was often known, grew slowly, but steadily. It numbered only 70,000 men in January 1804. However, the army contained roughly 120,000 troops by March and reached a total of slightly more than 170,000 in the summer of 1805.3 While French troops trained to invade Great Britain, the nature of the French government changed profoundly. Much like ancient Rome, whose symbolism would conspicuously mark the transformation, the Republic evolved into an empire. Napoleon and his supporters in the government contemplated the possibility of making him a hereditary ruler during the Consulate, the government that they created in 1799. However, they were well aware that such a move might provoke opposition from a country that had toppled the Bourbon monarchy and fought for a decade to ensure that France remained a republic. Support for the return of monarchy increased as the first consul’s policies succeeded in providing peace, stability, and prosperity From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n19\n\nand in response to assassination plots against him, including one conspiracy that received the direct assistance of the British government. Many feared that Napoleon’s death would plunge France back into chaos and threaten the achievements of the French Revolution. Therefore, he and his supporters convinced the Republic’s government to offer him the position of monarch in May of 1804. Since France’s recent history rendered the label of king unthinkable, it bestowed upon Napoleon the more fitting title of Emperor of the French, and formally declared France an empire. The French population approved the change in a plebiscite by a margin of more than 3.5 million votes, and Napoleon crowned himself emperor at Notre Dame Cathedral on December 2. The Army of the Coasts of the Ocean sent delegations to participate in the events of the coronation, but most of its men remained in their camps. They continued to occupy the Channel coasts for another ten months. The time that these troops spent preparing for the expedition to Britain was particularly important because it gave them crucial training and combat experience. France’s soldiers honed their skills by participating in firing exercises and conducting maneuvers to improve their ability to adapt to various tactical situations. For example, General Auguste Frederic Louis Viesse de Marmont, the commander of the Camp of Utrecht, proudly informed Napoleon, “We maneuver by division three times a week, & twice per month with [all] three divisions united. The troops have become very highly trained.”4 The soldiers on the coasts also skirmished with British naval forces. They fought against boarding parties sent to disrupt Napoleon’s plans, engaged in artillery duels with British ships, and embarked on French vessels where they saw combat in small-scale ship-to-ship actions. The Army of the Coasts of the Ocean not only prepared the bodies of its members for war; it also trained their hearts and minds. The years from 1803 to 1805 represented a crucial period for the development of the French army and French military culture. During the later phases of the French Revolution, the armies of the Republic became disillusioned with their country’s politicians and with French civilian society. France’s soldiers were forced to fend for themselves in various countries because the Directory, the executive council in charge of the French government, lacked the means to supply its armies. They felt that they had been abandoned by politicians, that the Republic had been corrupted, and that the citizenry of France was no longer grateful for their sacrifices. The troops came to believe that only they continued to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Consequently, they gave their allegiance not to the Directory but to charismatic generals such 20\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nas Bonaparte, Jean Victor Moreau, and Jean-Baptiste Kléber. After the establishment of the Consulate, Napoleon possessed a sizeable following in the army that was composed of the men whom he had led. However, substantial portions of the soldiery still harbored devotion to other generals. The war with Britain provided Napoleon with the perfect opportunity to increase his influence. Forming the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean allowed him to concentrate most of the French army in a relatively small area for an extended period of time. Moreover, its camps were within easy reach of Paris. Napoleon thus possessed roughly two full years free from major interruptions to secure the loyalty of France’s soldiers for himself and the new government that he established. He did not waste them. The new leader of France frequently traveled to the encampments near the Channel coast. Much as he had done in Italy and Egypt, Napoleon spared no effort to acquire the allegiance of France’s largest army. Napoleon’s supporters inside and outside of the military complemented these activities with a series of measures that were designed to maintain the morale of its troops and ensure that they adopted their political and military values. Finally, since the Army of the Coasts remained on or near French soil, Napoleon’s agents kept a close watch on it to ensure that rivals in the military would not be able to recruit followers from within its ranks. As a soldier who acquired political power through a coup d’état, Napoleon was well aware of the threat posed by ambitious generals.\n\nA Grande Armée for La Grande Nation Despite Napoleon’s best efforts to carry the fight to England’s shores, the battles of the Army of the Coasts remained limited to skirmishes at sea. The strength of the Royal navy and the inability of the French navy to concentrate sufficient forces in the English Channel prevented Napoleon from launching the invasion of Great Britain. The preparation that France’s soldiers received, however, would be put to good use on the Continent. Napoleon’s expansionist foreign policy, and transgressions such as his decision to abduct Louis Antoine de Bourbon, the Duke d’Enghien, in the neutral territory of Baden in order to carry out his execution, provoked the creation of a new alliance against France. By the summer of 1805, the Habsburg Empire, Russia, Naples, and Sweden joined Britain to forge the third Allied coalition to oppose France since the start of the French Revolution, hence its designation as the Third Coalition. To confront the threat posed by Habsburg and Russian forces, Napoleon reorganized the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean into the Grande Armée. From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n21\n\nEach of the main camps and the Army of Hanover was made a separate corps in the new army. For example, the Army of Hanover became I Corps, and the Camp of St. Omer at Boulogne became IV Corps. Usually commanded by a marshal of the Empire, a corps was a small army combining infantry, cavalry, and artillery that was capable of operating by itself. From 1805 to 1808, the Grande Armée normally consisted of nine to twelve corps, including Napoleon’s Imperial Guard, and each corps had between fifteen thousand and thirty thousand troops. The corps were organized into three or four divisions. Divisions were in turn divided into two or more brigades, which were composed of one or more regiments. Infantry regiments generally possessed three or four battalions, one of which functioned as a training and garrison unit, or depot battalion. War battalions, the battalions that accompanied the army in the field, had a paper strength of 1,078 men in nine companies. Cavalry regiments, on the other hand, contained between two and four squadrons, each with two companies. The theoretical size of the squadrons was approximately 180-230 troopers, depending on the type of cavalry. The infantry battalion and the cavalry squadron constituted the basic tactical units of Napoleon’s armies, along with the artillery company, which tended to be comprised of one hundred soldiers and eight cannons.5 While on campaign, the Grande Armée’s battalions typically fielded around 600-800 soldiers, and its squadrons 80-150 troopers. The size of the army as a whole fluctuated, but it usually averaged 180,000 men. The Grande Armée started the campaign of 1805 with approximately 194,000 soldiers. Sickness and other factors, however, reduced the number of combatants to roughly 178,000 after it crossed the Rhine.6 Later, when Napoleon conducted operations against the Fourth Coalition in the fall of 1806 and the spring of 1807, it numbered between 175,000 and 190,000 troops.7 In the initial stages of the war of the Third Coalition, Napoleon sought to separate the Habsburg forces and the Russians, his most dangerous enemies on the Continent, and defeat each in detail. The Austrians assisted him by invading Bavaria and assembling an army near the city of Ulm under the command of General Karl Leiberich, Baron Mack. Moving faster than his enemies expected, the French emperor marched the nine corps of the Grande Armée along parallel routes to surround Mack’s troops. A series of engagements around Ulm, including Wertingen, Haslach, and Elchingen, prevented them from escaping. The French then drove the Austrians back into Ulm, where they were forced to surrender over twenty thousand soldiers. Marshal Pierre François Charles Augereau’s VII Corps followed the remnants of Mack’s forces, and captured them at Dornbirn. The Grande Armée’s other 22\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nformations continued east, seizing Vienna and confronting a combined Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz. On December 2, 1805, exactly a year after Napoleon’s coronation, the French emperor won his greatest victory, shattering the Allied forces in a battle presided over by Alexander I, the tsar of Russia, and Francis I, the Hapsburg emperor. The French victory at the “Battle of the Three Emperors” dissolved the Third Coalition. It convinced Francis I to sign a peace treaty with France on January 1, 1806, and the tsar agreed to an armistice. A fourth coalition formed ten months later. The ruling class of Prussia resented the intervention of Napoleon’s government in German affairs. It was also humiliated by Prussian impotence in the face of French aggression during the war of the Third Coalition, which included violations of German and Prussian neutrality. A war party gathered around Queen Louise and Count Karl August von Hardenberg, and put increasing pressure on King Frederick William III to declare war. The king finally acted after Napoleon pushed him into closing Prussian markets to British trade and when he learned that the French emperor proposed to restore Hanover to Britain after he had granted it to Prussia. The war commenced in October of 1806 with an ultimatum from Frederick William III that required Napoleon to make a number of humiliating concessions by October 8, including the removal of all French troops to the left bank of the Rhine. The emperor responded by advancing with the Grande Armée to meet the Prussians. The French routed small enemy armies at Schleiz and Saalfeld, and then fought the main Prussian army in the twin battles of Jena-Auerstädt on October 14. Marshal Louis Nicholas Davout’s III Corps faced the main Prussian army at Auerstädt while Napoleon attacked the Prusso-Saxon advanced guard at Jena with the bulk of the Grande Armée. The herculean labors of Davout and his men averted a potential defeat, and the French won both battles. Afterwards, Napoleon’s army rapidly pursued the enemy, and succeeded in obliterating what was left of the Prussian army in a span of just over three weeks. The Grande Armée then turned to deal with the Russians, who had returned to the fray by joining the Fourth Coalition. Napoleon invaded Poland and the French quickly captured Warsaw. The Grande Armée then fought bloody and indecisive battles with Russian forces at Pultusk and Golymin on December 26. Following these engagements, Napoleon tried to settle into winter quarters. However, a Russian offensive led by General Leontiy Benningsen forced him to resume operations. Napoleon foiled Bennigsen’s plans, causing the Russians to retreat. The French brought them to bay at Eylau, where the two armies engaged in a horrific slugging match in the From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n23\n\nmiddle of snowstorms on February 7-8, 1807. Both sides suffered tremendous casualties, with the French losses reaching close to thirty thousand men.8 The Russians withdrew, but the Grande Armée was so badly mauled that the emperor declined to pursue. While most of the army recuperated, Napoleon replenished his losses and created a new army corps under Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre to besiege the city of Danzig. After months of bitter fighting, Danzig fell on May 27. Military operations by the main French and Russian field armies then resumed in June. The Russians initially went on the offensive, but they stalled in front of French defenses along the Passarge River. The French counterattacked, assaulting the Russians in strong defensive positions at Heilsberg on June 10, 1807. This battle resulted in another costly draw, and the Russians retreated intact. The Grande Armée pursued and caught up with them at Friedland. On June 14, 1807, it attacked, forcing Bennigsen’s troops to fight with the Alle River to their rear. Breaking the Russian army in two, the Grande Armée won a resounding victory in which it inflicted roughly twenty thousand casualties. The battle of Friedland finally convinced the tsar to make peace. In meetings near the town of Tilsit in July, Napoleon, Alexander I, and Frederick William III signed treaties that brought the war of the Fourth Coalition to an end. The settlement reached at Tilsit also established French dominance in Europe, dividing the continent into French and Russian spheres of influence. After the Peace of Tilsit, most of the Grande Armée remained in Germany and occupied Prussia. Some formations returned to France and a few participated in a French intervention in Spain. Napoleon sent troops to the Iberian Peninsula in October of 1807 to force Portugal to join the Continental System, a land-based blockade of Britain. He did so again in February of 1808 to protect his new possessions in Spain. A dispute arose in the Spanish royal family that allowed Napoleon to force the king of Spain and his heir to abdicate. He then created a new Kingdom of Spain that belonged to the French Empire, and placed his brother Joseph on its throne. Soon afterward, Spain exploded into rebellion, and a series of setbacks followed. Spanish resistance and the arrival of a British expeditionary force led to the capture of an entire French army at Bailen and the evacuation of Madrid. With the situation rapidly deteriorating, Napoleon believed that drastic steps were necessary. Accordingly, he transferred the Grande Armée’s I, V, and VI Corps from Germany to Spain. The Grande Armée was then formally dissolved in October of 1808, and its troops became part of the Army of Spain and the Army of the Rhine. The army that won Napoleon’s greatest victories was no more, but 24\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nits achievements and its impact upon the men who served in its ranks would affect France and the rest of Europe for decades to come.\n\nThe Construction of Napoleonic Military Culture Numerous factors contributed to the victories of the Grande Armée, but one of the most important was Napoleon’s legendary ability to motivate his soldiers. This skill seemed to come naturally to him, and it was a talent that he continuously exercised. To borrow a useful phrase, Napoleon was the “world’s first ‘media general,’” who employed every tool at his disposal to shape the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior of his troops.9 His gift for inspiring soldiers first became apparent in the Army of Italy. After assuming command in 1796, General Bonaparte relied on personal interaction with his men, rewards, and propaganda such as proclamations and newspapers to develop an intense bond with them. He earned the loyalty and admiration of his troops, and inspired them to achieve extraordinary victories under his command. When he became the leader of France, Napoleon devoted just as much effort to strengthening his hold over the soldiery. He simply did so on a much greater scale. Throughout the Consulate and the Empire, Napoleon endeavored to create a new military culture that would forge the entire French army into a military force that embodied his goals and values. This military culture was fashioned from a complex array of materials, including written and print media, songs, plays, and rewards. Festivals, ceremonies, and symbolic practices also played a prominent role in the indoctrination of Napoleon’s men. Napoleon, however, did not act alone in trying to mold a new army for his new regime. Studies on the soldiers of the Consulate and the Empire focus almost exclusively on the figure of Napoleon himself, and the methods that he used to acquire their devotion. To deny Napoleon’s centrality in the motivational system of his armies would be misleading, but it is crucial to recognize that a multitude of military and civilian officials, writers, composers, artists, and playwrights participated in the construction of Napoleonic military culture. Many, like the army’s leaders and civilian authorities, did so as part of their official functions. Napoleon likewise employed numerous individuals to create propaganda for his troops. In addition, there was a surprisingly large number of people who voluntarily helped him transform the French army. On their own initiative, they produced forms of media that expressed support for the Napoleonic regime and promoted what were perceived to be its values. Some engaged in this activity because they hoped to profit from Napoleon’s popularity, or because they From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n25\n\nwished to curry favor with the government. Others, who may or may not have possessed these motives, genuinely wanted to show their enthusiasm for Napoleon and contribute to the war effort.\n\nProclaiming the Emperor’s Truths: Written and Print Media Napoleon encouraged the production of literature and art that contributed to his military culture by granting rewards to artists and writers whose work he favored. Yet, not all unsolicited aid was welcomed. A propaganda pamphlet by Bertrand Barère represents a good example. Barère was an influential politician during the Revolution who was famous for his rhetorical skills. In the summer of 1804, he wrote a leaflet entitled Lettre à l’armée that was intended to inspire the Army of the Coasts in its struggle to defeat England. Upon learning of its existence, the emperor delivered a stinging rebuke, exploding, “there is no need to speak to the army; it does not read the vain babbling of pamphlets, and a word in the order of the day would do more than a hundred volumes of Cicero and Demosthenes.” Continuing his tirade, Napoleon instructed his minister of police, Joseph Fouché, to try to prevent the brochure’s circulation. “Tell Barère,” he explained, “whose pompous proclamations and sophisms are not in harmony with his colossal reputation, to no longer dabble in this type of writing. . . . The only legal means to speak to the army is the order of the day. Everything else is intrigue and faction.”10 This letter, which is surprisingly harsh, revealed Napoleon’s desire to dispense with the heavy-handed indoctrination programs used in the armies of the French Revolution. Yet it also showed a firm willingness to use another form of the written word to speak to the army. He identified orders of the day as his favored method for addressing his soldiers. Along with orders of the day, the Napoleonic regime distributed other types of written and print media to the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée. These items formed an important and distinct component of Napoleonic military culture. Unlike most measures that were intended to motivate Napoleon’s soldiers, they were presented to the armies of the Consulate and the Empire on an almost daily basis. Furthermore, such materials provided more information to the grognards than any other morale-building tool. The written and print media that appeared in Napoleon’s armies originated in the military culture of the French Revolution. Before 1789, French kings and their aristocratic generals rarely addressed common soldiers. 26\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nOften regarding enlisted men with open contempt, they generally felt that it was unnecessary or beneath them to explain themselves to the troops. These attitudes disappeared along with the Old Regime. The political chaos generated by the Revolution and the multiple threats that France faced rendered the political loyalties and military motivation of the army matters that required immediate and sustained attention. The leaders of Revolutionary France therefore deluged the army with information, political messages, and encouragement through a bewildering assortment of printed materials. The Revolutionaries’ mobilization of the press resembled their frenzied attempts to rally all of France to defend the new social and political order that they created. Political groups like the Jacobin club gave various forms of literature to soldiers to recruit supporters. Government officials bought periodicals and pamphlets for dissemination among the soldiery, and even individual armies produced newspapers to indoctrinate their troops. The use of print propaganda became more systematic in the fall of 1792 when the central government began to regularly send political journals such as the Bulletin de la Convention Nationale and Père Duchesne to the military. By the end of July, 1794, the Republic purchased over 7.5 million copies of journals for the military. In addition, the army received official documents from the government such as constitutions, decrees, and reports, all of which were supposed to be read to the troops. Military commanders then supplemented these items with their own propaganda materials.11 General Napoleon Bonaparte was no exception, though he would prove more adept at using the written word than his peers. He routinely addressed his troops through proclamations and orders of the day, and developed the style that would appear in the military culture of the Grande Armée.12 While commanding the Army of Italy and the Army of the Orient, he likewise founded newspapers such as the Courrier de l’Armée d’Italie and the Courrier de l’Egypte that were distributed to his soldiers.13 Perhaps because of Napoleon’s awareness of the power of the printed word to shape the army in ways that he could not control, he reduced the amount of written and printed material issued to the military after the creation of the Consulate. The Napoleonic regime replaced the Revolution’s print propaganda with three forms of media: orders of the day, proclamations, and military bulletins. Napoleon’s comments about Barère highlighted the importance that he attached to orders of the day. They were instructions issued by French military commanders to the men serving under them. During the Consulate and the Empire, orders of the day served as the primary channel through which Napoleon and the army’s leadership communicated with the troops. As a From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n27\n\nmilitary manual explained, “The general order of the day and the particular order of the regiment, . . . is the publication of the intentions of commanders, and serves in some ways as a supplement to regulations: it is the means of publicizing news and memorable punishments.”14 Each level of the military’s command structure, from the general staff of the army to the colonels of individual regiments, produced orders of the day. They percolated down to the troops in the following manner. In the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the commander of each camp, or his chief of staff, composed an order for his units. Almost every morning, the camp’s chief of staff transmitted this order to the divisional generals, who furnished their own order of the day for their division. Both the order of the camp and the order of the division were communicated to the generals of brigade. The brigadier generals then attached their orders of the day for the brigade to the pile. This laborious process repeated at the regimental level. The final step occurred when corporals or their equivalent in the cavalry, brigadiers, informed the men in their squad of all of the orders that pertained to them. The squad was the smallest administrative unit in the army, and consisted of between eleven and sixteen men. The formation of the Grande Armée added a new layer of orders. Napoleon and his chief of staff, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, often visited the Army of the Coasts, but they did not issue it orders of the day. The commanders of the individual camps therefore penned the most important orders received by its troops. Since Napoleon commanded the Grande Armée in person, he supplied it with a continuous stream of orders of the day. Berthier’s staff then printed and sent these orders to the army’s corps. They descended through the chain of command along with the orders of the corps, division, brigade, and regiment, following the same pattern used in the Army of the Coasts.15 The Grande Armée possessed a printing division that allowed Berthier’s staff to produce copies of the army’s orders in large numbers, which facilitated their distribution. With the exception of the Camp of St. Omer, which acquired the services of a printer, the Army of the Coasts made do with the practiced, and undoubtedly calloused, hands of its staff officers. Whether transcribed by hand or printed, orders of the day were usually read to the troops during roll calls. Roll calls, or appels, typically took place twice per day, but as many as five could be made.16 The units in the Camp of St. Omer assembled every day at 1:00 p.m. to hear the order of the day of the camp and the order of their division.17 When the Grande Armée was on the march, the grognards heard the recitation of orders of the day either before they began their journey, during rest halts, or after their unit stopped for the night.18 28\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nOrders of the day performed several tasks. They contained information about the routines that structured daily life in the army, such as where to obtain provisions and when roll calls would be made. In addition, orders of the day featured laws and military regulations. When violations occurred, they announced the conviction and punishment of the offenders. They also offered French soldiers praise and encouragement. Napoleon and his military commanders employed them to maintain morale, explain their goals to their troops, and list the rewards accorded to the army. The grognards were likewise provided with accounts of noteworthy military or political developments by orders of the day. Aside from this content, Napoleon and his military commanders frequently attached proclamations to their orders of the day. They normally did so on special occasions such as the establishment of the French Empire, before a battle, or after a victory. The men who led Napoleon’s armies also issued proclamations independently of their orders. Proclamations were such a useful instrument for addressing the troops because they could reach a wide audience. Since Napoleon and his subordinates could not speak to all of their soldiers due to the size of the forces that they commanded, these documents allowed them to give speeches to their men when they could not be physically present. Although Napoleon’s proclamations are legendary, historians have virtually ignored those of his subordinates. The latter delivered fewer declarations than their illustrious leader, but the ones that they did produce shaped the development of Napoleonic military culture in important ways. For example, Marshal Michel Ney’s address to VI Corps at the start of the 1805 campaign encouraged his troops to adopt certain attributes that were supposed to distinguish French soldiers: “I will not speak to the soldiers about their duty as warriors; I know the noble ardor that animates them; they will show the difference that exists between mercenaries fighting for a foreign cause and men who defend their unjustly attacked country; French blood only flows when honor orders it.”19 The proclamations composed by Napoleon also frequently portrayed France as the victim of foreign aggression. He issued thirteen addresses to the army from the fall of 1805 to the fall of 1808. To these may be added declarations to the Bavarian army in 1805 and to the people of Saxony in 1806, and three speeches that Napoleon gave to France’s legislatures about the wars of the Third and Fourth Coalitions. Although he did not initially deliver the speeches to the troops, they were affixed to the Grande Armée’s proclamations or orders of the day, indicating that Napoleon wanted his soldiers to hear them.20 Yet the proclamations were not just intended for the army. The From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n29\n\nemperor made sure that they were published in newspapers, posted on placards, and spread abroad to influence the civilian population of the Empire and the rest of Europe. The proclamations normally took the form of stirring addresses that were replete with striking imagery and catchy phrases. In them, Napoleon explained the reasons for war, outlined his military plans, promised to reward the troops, challenged them to maintain their reputation, and praised their accomplishments. The famous announcement after Austerlitz contained several of these features: Soldiers! I am content with you; in the battle of Austerlitz, you justified all that I expected of your intrepidity; you have decorated your eagles with an immortal glory. An army of a hundred thousand men commanded by the Emperors of Russia and Austria has been cut down or dispersed in less than four hours; those who escaped your iron have been drowned in the lakes. 40 flags, the standards of the Russian Imperial Guard, 120 cannons, 20 generals, and more than 30,000 prisoners are the results of this forever memorable day. This infantry so renowned, and in superior numbers, could not resist your shock; and henceforth, you no longer have any rivals to fear: thus in two months, this third coalition has been vanquished and dissolved.21\n\nSimilar to orders of the day, the emperor’s proclamations were printed, distributed to the different units of the Grande Armée, and read aloud. Sometimes, they were read to the troops consecutively over a series of days to enhance their effect. Following the campaign of 1805, Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult ordered the proclamation of 6 Nivôse, year XIV, which announced peace with the Habsburg Empire, to be recited daily in the units of his corps.22 Such efforts were not in vain, for Napoleon’s proclamations appear to have had a significant impact. French troops mentioned the emperor’s proclamations in their writings, indicating that they considered them noteworthy enough to record.23 Some soldiers, like Corporal JeanJacques Bellavoine, even kept copies of them, further suggesting that they possessed special meaning for the men who served in the Grande Armée.24 Napoleon’s soldiers also expressed interest in the third type of print propaganda: the Bulletin de la Grande Armée. This publication took the form of a news sheet. It was short, usually consisting of a page or two, and its publication was irregular. The bulletins appeared when military operations commenced, and normally stopped when active campaigning was not taking place, or once hostilities ceased. Altogether, 124 of them were printed 30\n\n| From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nfrom 1805 to 1808.25 Napoleon is credited with writing most of the bulletins, and the rest have been attributed to his secretary of state, Hugues Bernard Maret. Like the emperor’s proclamations, Napoleon designed the Bulletin de la Grande Armée to appeal to a wide audience. He used it to justify France’s involvement in the Napoleonic wars and mobilize support for the struggle against the Allies. To reach the general public, Napoleon required newspapers like the Moniteur universel, the official journal of the French government, to feature the Bulletin. His officials displayed poster-sized copies in public squares in towns and cities, and encouraged public readings of the bulletins in churches, schools, and theaters. Furthermore, Napoleon’s agents circulated the bulletins throughout Europe to influence foreign leaders and manipulate public opinion.26 In the French army, the Bulletin de la Grande Armée took the place of the political journals that were supplied to the Republic’s military forces. It normally arrived a few weeks or even months after the events that it described. For example, the bulletins for the campaign of 1805 do not seem to have reached the Grande Armée until well after the battle of Austerlitz. On March 2, 1806, exactly three months later, Lieutenant Félix Avril excitedly reported to his father that his regiment had “just received the bulletins of our army.”27 French soldiers obtained the Bulletin through different channels. Avril’s comments suggest that either the Ministry of the Interior or the Ministry of War delivered copies of the Bulletin de la Grande Armée directly to the troops. The grognards could also find it in the Moniteur and other journals when they were able to acquire them.28 They may have read the bulletins in foreign newspapers or in pamphlet form when French military leaders had them published to influence public opinion in French-controlled territories.29 In addition, the Imperial government published compilations of the bulletins after the conclusion of the Grande Armée’s campaigns, which appear to have been provided to the army.30 The content of the Bulletin de la Grande Armée focused on military operations. It provided detailed accounts of the Grande Armée’s campaigns and battles, reported the maneuvers of military units and the actions of individuals, and explained their meaning. In doing so, the Bulletin showed French soldiers whose perception of events was limited by their proximity to the action exactly how they were contributing to the war effort. The bulletins also addressed a variety of other topics that provided the troops with the ability to comprehend their role in the wider drama of the Napoleonic wars. They discussed the motives of the enemy, the character of foreign peoples, and the goals of Imperial France. They refuted enemy propaganda and described From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n31\n\nthe qualities of the French soldier. As one might expect, the Bulletin likewise recounted anecdotes about Napoleon to illustrate his personal qualities and accomplishments. The rhetorical strategies that governed the Bulletin de la Grande Armée were also important. The bulletins employed an engaging style and vibrant images to portray war as a grand romantic adventure. They contained exciting descriptions of the events in which the Grande Armée participated, the sights that it witnessed, the peoples it encountered, and the personalities that determined its fate. The thirtieth bulletin, which recounted the battle of Austerlitz, displayed their riveting quality. Much like a movie, it allowed the audience to feel the electric ambiance of the battlefield while avoiding the danger and the carnage: The Emperor, surrounded by all of the marshals, was waiting to give his last orders until the horizon was fully illuminated. At the first rays of the sun, the orders were given, and each marshal rejoined his corps at full gallop. The Emperor said in passing in front of the camps of several regiments: “Soldiers, it is necessary to end this campaign with a clap of thunder that will silence the pride of our enemies;” and instantly, hats on the ends of bayonets and cries of “Vive l’Empereur!” became the true signal for combat.31\n\nFor the men who survived the terrifying ordeal of this battle and others, the bulletins’ compelling narrative diverted attention away from the horrors and hardships that they endured, and reminded them about the extraordinary nature of their experiences and accomplishments. Bulletins, proclamations, and orders of the day were not the only kinds of written and print media that circulated in Napoleon’s armies. The Ministry of War occasionally sent copies of the Moniteur to the men on the front lines.32 This periodical was one of the Napoleonic regime’s most important propaganda instruments. It printed news about international and domestic events from the perspective of the Consular and the Imperial government. Newspapers like the Moniteur and the semi-official Journal de l’Empire also reached the Army of the Coasts, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée in other ways. Some French officers acquired private subscriptions to them, and the papers then arrived in the mail. Other individuals, like Jean-Baptiste Barrès, a foot soldier in the Imperial Guard, went to cafés to read them.33 Yet, the writings of Napoleon’s soldiers frequently complained about their ignorance of current events, indicating that the arrival of newspapers was irregular.34 32\n\n|\n\nFrom the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\nTo prevent ignorance of the law, the French government provided official documents to the army such as ministerial reports, government decrees, and decisions rendered by France’s legislative assemblies.35 Upon their reception, these materials were communicated to the troops. Supplementing these notices, the army also received administrative and technical publications like the Journal militaire, which collected the latest laws, regulations, and memoranda pertaining to the military.36\n\nSinging the Praises of Napoleon and His Grognards: Songs and the Theater In all likelihood, French soldiers listened to the recitation of most laws and regulations with resignation or indifference rather than enthusiasm. The songs that they heard in the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée undoubtedly elicited a far more positive response. Singing and songs occupied a prominent place in French popular culture and military culture long before Napoleon’s reign. During the early modern period, the French were believed to have a particular affinity for singing.37 The soldiers of the Royal army enjoyed this activity as much as the civilian population. In fact, many of the songs sung by French children today, such as “Trois jeunes tambours,” “Malbrough s’en va t’en guerre,” and “Auprès de ma blonde,” were originally military songs that were sung first by the men who fought for the kings of France.38 With the collapse of the Old Regime, the Revolutionaries recognized the French soldier’s love of song and transformed it into a potent weapon. Different Revolutionary governments employed songs to both indoctrinate and motivate their troops. They patronized songwriters to compose military songs, and sent thousands of song sheets and songbooks to the troops. The “Marseillaise,” the French national anthem, was written for the soldiers of the French Revolution. Moreover, in just the fall of 1794, the Republic supplied forty-two thousand copies of the “Chant des victoires,” the “Chant du départ,” and the “Hymne à la fraternité” to its armies.39 Napoleon also relied on songs to influence the French army, but in a more indirect manner. The officials of the Consulate and the Empire did not send songs to the military on a regular basis. They did, however, stage events in which songs were deliberately sung to French troops and given out to them. Numerous songs were circulated in Paris for Napoleon’s coronation, and the large numbers of soldiers who were present for the occasion must have obtained them. A few years later, Napoleon’s government held a series From the Coasts of the Ocean to the Snows of Poland\n\n|\n\n33\n\nof celebrations for the Grande Armée when it returned to France after the Peace of Tilsit. The emperor actively participated in their planning, and he directed Emmanuel Cretet, the minister of the interior, to make sure that songs played a leading role in the festivities. Napoleon instructed Cretet to have songs written in Paris and sent to the different towns and cities through which the army would pass. He explained that these songs were to be sung to the troops in banquets, and that he wanted “three kinds of songs, so that the soldier will not hear the same ones sung twice.”40 The authorities carried out the emperor’s instructions by having songs passed out to the soldi"
