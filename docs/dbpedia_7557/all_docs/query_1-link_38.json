        "text": "In addition to being the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, it’s also #MarshalMonday once again. This week I’m taking a look at one of the most controversial of them all; the man who Napoleon considered a friend yet whose ducal title became synonymous with ‘betrayal’: Auguste Frédéric Louis Viesse de Marmont.\n\nA member of the petite noblesse, Marmont was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine in 1774. His father was an ex-army officer and it was soon clear that the son would follow in his footsteps. In 1792 he was enrolled at the artillery school of Châlons, where he studied for six months.\n\nCreated 2nd Lieutenant, he was sent to serve at the siege of Toulon, where he quickly became a close friend of a young captain called Napoleon Bonaparte, who took him on as ADC and promoted him to chef de bataillon. When Napoleon left for the Army of Italy, so also went Marmont.\n\nMarmont served at Cherasco, Mondovi, Lodi, Castiglione, Saint-Georges, Mantua and in October 1796 he was given the honour of taking captured standards back to the Directory in Paris. For this, he was promoted to chef de brigade. He re-joined the army just in time for the battle of Arcola.\n\nHe then accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, being promoted to général de brigade on the way after he seized the flag of the Knights of St John when the fleet landed at Malta. When Napoleon returned to France in 1799, Marmont was one of a select few to accompany him. He leant his support to Napoleon during the Brumaire coup.\n\nMarmont was made commander of the artillery of Army of the Reserve and performed well at Marengo. Afterwards he was transferred to the Army of Italy in the same role. However, despite these high-ranking commands, when the list of Marshals was announced in 1804, his name was not on it.\n\nIt was safe to say that Marmont resented this: rather spitefully remarking that “if Bessières can be made a marshal then anyone can be one”. He was instead given the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour. In 1806 he was made Governor General of Dalmatia & showed a genuine talent for administration. For this, Napoleon awarded him the title of Duke of Ragusa.\n\nHe was recalled to active service in 1809 to act as reserve at Wagram. However, after the battle he pursued the Austrians and was victorious at Znaim. For this he was at last raised to the marshalate, though Napoleon himself is reported to have said: “Between ourselves, you have not done enough to justify entirely my choice.” (Ouch!)\n\nThe soldiers of the Grand Armée seemed to agree, and put Marmont’s promotion down to his closeness with the Emperor; taking up the ditty: “MacDonald is France’s choice, Oudinot is the army’s choice and Marmont is friendship’s choice”.\n\nIn 1810, Marmont was sent to Spain to replace Massena and here he initially performed reasonably well, providing a challenge to Wellington on several occasions. However, then came Salamanca which was undoubtedly his worst hour. Marmont badly misjudged things and was utterly obliterated by Wellington’s army, taking a severe wound in the process.\n\nIn 1814, tired of war, Marmont negotiated a surrender with the Allies. However, he did not inform his troops of this and led them into a position where they were essentially forced to surrender; thus ruining his reputation and leaving Napoleon with no option but to abdicate.\n\n“Unhappy man – I loved him!” said Napoleon, when the news reached him.\n\nMade a peer of France for his actions, Marmont afterwards wholly adhered to the Bourbons. He voted for Michel Ney’s execution not once but twice and misled Ney’s wife into thinking he would help her plead for clemency. He was in command of the troops in Paris when the people rose against Charles X. Here he performed so poorly that the Duc d’Angouleme was prompted to ask him: “Will you betray us, as you betrayed him?”.\n\nMarmont accompanied the king into exile and never returned to France again. He lived the longest of all the marshals but his reputation was utterly in tatters. In French his ducal title became a verb, meaning to betray. He spent the rest of his life in exile and died in 1852 in Venice, where little children would allegedly point him out in the streets and exclaim “there goes the man who betrayed Napoleon!”\n\nIn debates regarding the best and worst of the marshals, Marmont’s name often comes up under ‘worst’, but perhaps ‘least loyal’ (with competition from Bernadotte!) is more accurate. Napoleon, with the notable exception of his utterly useless siblings, was not in the habit of promoting incompetents. However, while each of the marshals had their flaws and foibles, it is very difficult to find any redeeming qualities in Marmont, who seems to have let down virtually everyone who ever trusted him."
