I would like to begin with my friend and mentor John A. Lynn II. I owe John a debt of gratitude that I can never repay. Without him, neither this book nor my academic career would have been possible. John has always been willing to make time to help me in any manner that he could. He kindly agreed to read this book in its many incarnations and never failed to provide valuable advice that improved it considerably. I also particularly admire John’s magnanimity. This book begins by challenging the historical interpretation of military motivation under Napoleon formulated by John himself. Academics often have prickly egos, and most do not welcome critiques of their scholarship, including those advanced by their former graduate students. John, however, supported this project from beginning to end in every conceivable way, and showed a professionalism and a generosity that I try to emulate in my own career. Finally, I would like to thank him most of all for his humanity. When I found myself questioning my decision to pursue a Ph.D. in history, and experienced some personal losses late in my graduate career, John gave me the encouragement that I needed to continue, and had the patience and compassion to let me proceed at my own pace.\n\nNext, I would like to thank Clare H. Crowston, who has had a profound impact on my development as a scholar. More than anyone else, she taught me the value of gender history, which transformed my original research project into a vastly different, and much better, book. The intellectual sophistication that Clare so effortlessly displays has also inspired me to follow her example in my own professional endeavors. In addition, I was fortunate enough to begin my career as a historian under the late Russell F. Weigley. From him, I learned the important lesson that war and combat are an integral part of military history.\n\nOthers provided crucial assistance by reading and critiquing different chapters in this book. I am especially thankful for the help of Alan Forrest, who aided me at different stages of this project, and Philip Dwyer, whose suggestions and generous support played a central role in its publication. This book has also benefited from the contributions of Jeremy Black, Sam A. Mustafa, Charles Esdaile, Kenneth M. Cuno, and Mark Grimsley. Furthermore, the knowledge and expertise of Frederick C. Schneid and Eman M. Vovsi proved essential for catching and correcting factual errors.\n\nIn France, I need to thank Jean-Paul Bertaud, who helped me to secure funding for my research and generously offered me his time, his contacts, and his knowledge of document collections in Paris. I am also grateful to Gilbert Bodinier, Bernard Gainot, Christian Schneider, Laurent Henninger, Jean-Marie Linsolas, and Chantal Lheureux-Prévot for their assistance with my research and for enriching my time in France. Moreover, this book could not have been written without the aid of the staff of the Archives de la guerre (which are now the Archives de l’armée de terre), or a Chateaubriand fellowship granted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nCloser to home, I am very appreciative of my wonderful colleagues in the History Department at Iona College. They spared me from teaching new courses and from administrative duties by shouldering these burdens themselves, and gave me the time that I, as a junior faculty member, so desperately needed to write this book. I must also say a special thanks to Ed Helmrich and the rest of the staff at Ryan Library, who tracked down any source that I needed. I was equally fortunate to work with extraordinary people at New York University Press. The series editor, Wayne E. Lee, has been a firm supporter of this project from the start, and gave me useful commentary on the manuscript that made this a stronger book. Above all, I would like to thank my editor, Deborah Gershenowitz. Ever cheerful, Debbie was always available to provide advice, information, and encouragement, and she made writing this book much easier. I am likewise grateful for the help of her pleasant and professional assistant, Gabrielle Begue.\n\nI want to close by thanking my family. My parents, Joseph R. Hughes and Marilyn G. Hughes, contributed to this book in numerous ways. They were a constant source of love and support, both emotional and financial. No matter where my career happened to take me, they were eager to visit, whether it was Philadelphia, New York, Paris, or even more exotic east-central Illinois. Finally, I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my beloved wife, Beatriz Martin-Ruiz. In many ways, this book is her victory as much as it is mine. Like the intrepid cantinières who followed their husbands in Napoleon’s armies across Europe, she accompanied me on every step of the long journey to publishing it. She too has suffered and sacrificed much along the way, leaving her remarkable family in Spain to marry an American obsessed with French history who abandoned her on countless days, nights, and weekends to write. Considering that the Frenchmen whom I study probably fought and killed some of her ancestors, my wife’s devotion is even more commendable. Her love, patience, and support have given me the ability to complete this project, and I lack the words to fully express my appreciation. For now, I will simply say, Bea, I love you, thank you for making this accomplishment possible, and I’m so incredibly lucky that you’re here to share it with me.\n\nSome of the material in this book will be published in Michael J. Hughes, Images of the Grognard: Songs, French Soldiers, and Military Culture in the Armies of Napoleon, Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, Selected Papers 2003. This book also contains material that will be published in Michael J. Hughes, Celebrating the Grande Armée: Military Motivation and National Identity in the Armies of Napoleon, Consortium on the Revolutionary Era, Selected Papers 2009.\n\nFurthermore, some of the material in this book appeared in Michael J.

Forth and Bertrand Taithe, eds., French Masculinities: History, Culture, and Politics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007). This material has been reproduced with the permission of Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nThere are a few final intellectual debts to honor that I was unable to properly acknowledge elsewhere before this book went to press. My descriptions of the start of the Napoleonic wars, the diplomatic maneuvers involved, and the creation of the French Empire were strongly influenced by the works of Steven Englund, Frederick C. Scheid, and Isser Woloch. In addition, the information in this book about the French army under the Directory and its loyalty to generals other than Napoleon during the Consulate comes from Jean-Paul Bertaud and Gilbert Bodinier. Lastly, this study relies on statistical information about army sizes, unit strengths, and battle casualties from books by David G. Chandler, Scott Bowden, and Robert Goetz. Unless the notes specify otherwise, the figures contained in the following pages are drawn from them. The publications of all these individuals are listed in the bibliography.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMilitary Culture and Motivation in the Armies of Napoleon\n\nFrançois-Joseph Zickel served as a cavalry officer in the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte, and his long military career spanned the entire period of the Napoleonic wars. Zickel was born the son of a soldier, and from a young age he eagerly desired to follow in his father’s footsteps. In the heady days of 1791, as Revolutionary France prepared its defenses, he enlisted in one of the new local guard units that were formed to supplement the regiments of the former Royal army. With popular support for the Revolution still in the ascendant, men from all over France volunteered for military service. Zickel, however, was unusual because he was only twelve years old. Two years later, he went a step further and joined a battalion headed to the front lines. Upon his arrival at the Armée du Nord, the military authorities discovered his age and promptly sent him home. Despite this setback, Zickel maintained his enthusiasm for the profession of arms. When he was finally old enough, he entered the 10th regiment of chasseurs à cheval, a unit of light cavalry. He was then nineteen, and the year was 1798.\n\nFor the next fifteen years, Zickel had a remarkable military career. After several years as a noncommissioned officer (NCO), he was promoted to second lieutenant, a commissioned rank, in 1807. He fought under General André Masséna at the second battle of Zurich in 1799, participated in the capture of Ulm in 1805, charged with French cavalry at Jena in 1806, served in Spain during the disastrous Peninsular War, and took part in the defense of France in 1814. Although he fought in several major engagements, he miraculously managed to survive the Napoleonic wars. Yet while he dreamed of rising through the ranks like countless others, possessed years of experience, and was devoted to Napoleon, he never rose above the rank of second lieutenant.¹\n\nIt is possible to reconstruct Zickel’s career through a series of letters that he wrote to his father. These letters reveal the officer’s feelings about war and his military service, and illustrate the ways in which his motivation and political values changed over time. When he legally entered the army in 1798, Zickel had lost none of the Revolutionary ardor that inspired him to volunteer for the military as a boy of twelve. Following his description of the fighting around Zurich, he defiantly exclaimed, \"Thus, vive la République [long live the Republic] forever one and indivisible, and death to tyrants!\"² Ten years later, Zickel showed the same enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France. After the French victory at Ocaña, Spain, in 1809, he proudly reported to his father, \"Thus the loss of the enemy could amount to 40,000 men! Vive l’Empereur! [Long live the Emperor!]\"³ What an astonishing transformation! Here we have a French officer who began his career as a dedicated Republican patriot expressing devotion to a hereditary monarch whose power was more absolute than that of any of the supposedly Absolutist kings of the Old Regime. Moreover, this monarch invaded and conquered a sovereign country, forced its rightful rulers to abdicate, and made his brother its king by force of arms. Such acts resembled those of the very tyrants whose deaths Zickel had professed to desire a decade earlier.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to ascertain how and why this shift in attitudes occurred. It attempts to explain why Zickel and other French soldiers, who came from a France that shed so much blood and spent so much treasure to preserve the ideals of the French Revolution, fought so hard and so well under Napoleon and continued to give their lives year after year to expand the empire that he established. To accomplish this task, this study examines the military culture created by the Napoleonic regime to influence its troops, and its impact on the Frenchmen who served in the armies of the Consulate (1799-1804) and the First French Empire (1804-1814). In pursuit of these endeavors, the book examines cultural phenomena and concepts of masculinity that affected the military performance of soldiers like François-Joseph Zickel but that have been neglected or misunderstood. The product of these phenomena was an intricate motivational system that convinced French officers and enlisted men to wage war for a variety of compelling reasons.\n\nThe motivation of Napoleon’s troops is not a new subject to historians. There is an enormous body of literature on the military history of the Napoleonic wars, and scholars have written about Napoleon’s morale-building techniques and their effects on the French army since the early nineteenth century.⁴ The standard interpretation on this topic in Anglo-American historiography can be characterized as the army of honor thesis, and was developed by John A. Lynn.⁵ Lynn proposes that Napoleon, who was hostile to the Revolution, changed the French army from an army of virtue into an army of honor. According to Lynn, the French Revolutionaries created an army of citizen soldiers whose primary source of military motivation was the concept of Revolutionary virtue. Revolutionary virtue was devotion to the common good and the willingness to sacrifice personal interests, including one’s life and well-being, to serve the collective needs of society and the nation. Maximilien Robespierre and other committed revolutionaries inculcated this ideal in the army as part of their efforts to transform France into a Republic of Virtue during the Terror.\n\nLynn argues that Napoleon replaced virtue with honor as the driving force in the French army. Drawing upon the political theories of Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, he defines honor as the desire for prestige and status that was traditionally associated with the French aristocracy, and the exercise of absolute monarchy in the Old Regime. Montesquieu explained that aristocratic honor was the mechanism that allowed monarchy to function. To acquire the services of their proud nobles, French kings like Louis XIV offered them rewards, or honors, such as positions in the government, titles, and medals like the badge of the Order of Saint Louis. In return, the nobles, Montesquieu claimed, performed actions that furthered the interests of the monarchy to obtain the king’s honors. They did so because their sense of honor, their personal need to uphold their reputation, compelled them to win royal rewards and the increased status that they conveyed. The distribution of honors thus allowed French kings to manipulate aristocratic honor and harness it to the goals of the monarchy.\n\nLynn contends that Napoleon, who wished to become an absolute monarch, imitated his Bourbon predecessors. He argues that the former Revolutionary general cultivated aristocratic forms of honor among his soldiers by creating a system of symbolic and material rewards such as promotions, the Legion of Honor, and titles of nobility. The purpose of these awards was to produce soldiers who valued individual prestige over the common good, and who owed their loyalties to the source of the rewards, Napoleon himself, instead of the French people, the Republic, or the nation. Together, these solders constituted an army of honor that provided Napoleon with the perfect instrument to achieve his imperial ambitions. Implying that Napoleon betrayed the Revolution, Lynn insists that he replaced the Revolution’s admirable emphasis on self-sacrifice with the self-interested desire for personal fame and aggrandizement. In his words, Napoleon wished to appeal to the French love of honor in lieu of other affections, such as that for liberty.⁶\n\nThese arguments were presented as a proposal to encourage further debate and inquiry, but despite Lynn’s intentions, they have taken on a life of their own to dominate Napoleonic military history. The bicentennial of Napoleon’s reign, which is still taking place, inspired a new wave of scholarship that reinforces, modifies, and challenges the army-of-honor thesis. Long neglected by nonmilitary historians, the Napoleonic wars have been rediscovered by scholars in other fields, and the study of them is experiencing something of a renaissance. One of the causes underlying this trend is the renewed interest in the Napoleonic period generated by the bicentennial. Perhaps just as important, Western historians appear to be discovering a new appreciation for the centrality of war in human history due to the military conflicts provoked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As a result of these developments, historians in the United States and Europe increasingly recognize the Napoleonic wars as a pivotal event in the emergence of the modern world, and are producing innovative studies that reevaluate the nature, meaning, and impact of Napoleon’s reign and his wars on France and Europe.\n\nIn this body of literature, the most important English-language work on Napoleon’s soldiers was written by Alan Forrest.⁷ Forrest modifies the army-of-honor thesis by emphasizing more continuity in the moral evolution of the army. He maintains that professionalism was more advanced in the Revolutionary armies and that patriotism was present to a greater extent in the armies of Napoleon than Lynn proposes. However, Forrest accepts Lynn’s basic theory, and characterizes the French army of the Napoleonic wars as an army of honor.⁸ Although he claims that Revolutionary forms of patriotism existed among the soldiers of both the Republic and the Empire, especially in the initial stages of their military service, he argues that this commitment to the national cause was transformed into professional pride in the army, the desire for personal rewards, and devotion to the emperor. Similar to other proponents of the army-of-honor thesis, Forrest also attributes the army’s loyalty to Napoleon to his personal charisma and talents, his ability to relate to his troops, and the awards that he offered to them.\n\nWhile Forrest discusses military motivation, it is not the primary focus of his book. He seeks to reveal the thoughts, emotions, and experiences of French troops during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. The point of this endeavor is to compare the men who emerge from his sources with the heroic images of the French soldier in Napoleonic propaganda, and to challenge the myths about Napoleon’s men that have persisted until the present day. Forrest succeeds admirably in these tasks. Unlike the existing literature on Revolutionary and Napoleonic soldiers, which relies mainly on secondary works and soldiers’ memoirs that were composed decades after 1815, he uses a large collection of letters and diaries written by French troops during their military service. Analyzing these documents, many of which are housed in departmental archives, Forrest argues that real French soldiers contrasted sharply with representations of them in official discourse as patriotic and warlike supermen. He claims that save for a small minority of officers and NCOs, Napoleon’s men generally disliked military life and were usually afraid, depressed, homesick, and eager for peace. Moreover, the Empire’s ceaseless wars and the suffering that they caused gradually eroded whatever enthusiasm for war or military service its soldiers might have possessed.\n\nNatalie Petiteau’s depiction of Napoleon’s troops resembles that of Forrest. In her studies on French soldiers and veterans of the Napoleonic wars, she attempts to shatter the myths about them that emerged in the nineteenth century and explain how the veterans contributed to the construction of French national identity.⁹ Popular legends surrounding the veterans and most historical literature portrayed them as fanatics devoted to the emperor and the French nation. After they were forcibly discharged from the army and became demi-soldes, this fanaticism led them to plot constantly to restore Napoleon and his dynasty to power.¹⁰ After examining the lives, careers, and political activities of French veterans during and after the Napoleonic wars, Petiteau concludes that they did not conform to the model of the disgruntled, Bonapartist grognard. The term \"grognard\" meant grumbler or complainer. Originally, it referred to the infantry of the Imperial Guard, but it later evolved into a popular nickname that was applied more generally to all of Napoleon’s soldiers. According to Petiteau, veterans, except for an active and vocal minority, reintegrated into civilian society and refrained from political activities. Most of them acquired a sense of national identity, group solidarity, and Bonapartist political sympathies in the decades after their service in the army. Like Forrest, she recognizes that many French soldiers possessed tremendous admiration and affection for Napoleon because they perceived him as a great man, a hero and a genius who could accomplish the impossible. She also proposes that some of them internalized the military values of the army and were seduced by martial glory. Others forged strong bonds within their regiment, which became a surrogate family and sustained them through the harrowing ordeal of the Napoleonic wars. Yet, challenging the army-of-honor thesis, Petiteau asserts that one of the principal sources of military motivation in Napoleon’s armies was a spirit of submission. Comparing their troops to the poilus of World War I, she claims that a culture of obedience in France inculcated subordination to familial, social, and political authorities.¹¹ While some French men developed a desire for glory and patriotism in the army, and many soldiers had a strong attachment to Napoleon and their units, most were reluctant conscripts who waged war because they were habituated to following the dictates of their parents and the state.\n\nThe distinguished French historian, Jean-Paul Bertaud, presents similar arguments about the motivation, or lack thereof, of the common soldiers of the First Empire. Bertaud’s most recent book investigates the role of the French army in the militarization of Napoleonic France.¹² In it, he portrays the enlisted men of the Consulate and the Empire as victims of the Napoleonic regime, declaring that historians have tended to view relations between Napoleon and his soldiers through the myths of the Napoleonic legend. He claims that only the reckless, young volunteers obsessed with adventure and glory and memorialists quick to embellish everything possessed a passion for war. Once the novelty of military life wore off, fear, despair, and resignation characterized the sentiments of the majority of the grognards. Bertaud even suggests that the enthusiasm they displayed on the battlefield was due to drunkenness as much as any alleged national gaiety.¹³\n\nThough he does not engage Lynn’s work directly or explicitly, Bertaud also disputes the army-of-honor thesis. In contrast to Lynn, who believes that Napoleon betrayed the French Revolution, Bertaud situates his reign and his armies within the broader framework of the Revolutionary era. He recognizes that Napoleon wanted new conquests to establish his political legitimacy, acquire personal glory, and secure his place in the historical record. However, he also proposes that the Empire’s wars were driven by a vision of the French nation developed during the Revolution. Napoleon and his supporters, Bertaud maintains, continued to regard France as la Grande Nation, or the Great Nation. The concept of the Great Nation identified France as the premier nation in Europe and the pinnacle of civilization. Moreover, this nation possessed an obligation to bring the rights of man, civil equality, and the principle of national sovereignty to the oppressed peoples of Europe. Bertaud contends that the Napoleonic regime inherited these ideas and used them to launch a new crusade. This struggle was a war to preserve the hegemony of the Great Nation, uphold its honor, and spread the benefits of the Revolution and French civilization to the rest of Europe. The conflict was also a battle between good and evil in which Napoleon, who embodied the Great Nation, was defending France and civilization itself from the barbaric and treacherous English.\n\nBertaud demonstrates that Napoleon and his supporters continuously sought to enlist the French people and the French army in this crusade. They assembled a vast array of propaganda and rewards, and mobilized the educational system, the arts, and established churches to convince French men to commit themselves to the cause of the Great Nation. Honor, Bertaud explains, constituted an essential component of this program. Like Lynn, he maintains that honor was the principal attribute of the French army during the Napoleonic wars, and that Napoleon deliberately employed it as an instrument of military motivation. Yet Bertaud insists that Napoleonic honor differed fundamentally from the aristocratic honor of the Old Regime. In the crucible of the Revolution, traditional concepts of honor combined with Revolutionary virtue in the French army to forge a new form of honor. This new honor preserved the nobility’s need to demonstrate physical courage and loyalty, command respect, and protect the weak, but it rejected the self-interest that had defined Old Regime honor. According to Bertaud, Napoleonic honor identified honor with service to the nation and the honor of the nation. Individuals and groups could only acquire status and prestige through acts that contributed to the common good. Virtue thus became honor during the Consulate and the Empire. Furthermore, Bertaud claims, Napoleon was not content to promote honor in the army. He institutionalized the military’s virtuous honor through the Legion of Honor, and held the army up as a model for civilian society in order to cultivate it in the general population. Bertaud therefore concurs that the French army evolved into an army of honor during the Napoleonic era, but argues that it possessed a motivational system that conserved revolutionary virtue in a modified form and required devotion to the revolutionary Great Nation. For him, Napoleon’s army resembled the military forces of the French Revolution far more than it did those of the Old Regime.\n\nThe works reviewed thus far have dramatically expanded our knowledge of Napoleon’s soldiers, their values and motivations, and the relationship among war, political culture, and nationalism in Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. This book benefits greatly from these studies, but it also goes beyond them by combining military history with the analysis of culture and gender. There is still a need for further inquiry into the subject of military motivation in the armies of Napoleon. Recent monographs like those of Forrest, Petiteau, and Bertaud succeed in challenging many of the myths surrounding the grognards. Yet, in replacing the enthusiastic, patriotic, glory-obsessed, and emperor-worshiping French soldier with the resigned, unenthusiastic, and homesick conscript, they fail to offer a satisfactory explanation for the outstanding military performance of Napoleon’s armies. After reading their work, one is left wondering how an army composed of such troops could repeatedly defeat the highly trained, professional forces of their opponents on the battlefield, and continue to wage war year after year even as France’s enemies continued to multiply and the prospect of peace became increasingly remote.\n\nIn addition, military motivation is a complex phenomenon that is produced by the interaction of numerous factors. One of the foundations of any system of military motivation is the military culture existing in an army. The historical literature on Napoleon’s armies, however, refrains from fully investigating the military culture created inside of the armies of the Consulate and the Empire. Existing studies often base their interpretations on the rewards offered to the army and neglect the cultural context in which they were distributed.¹⁴ Others draw conclusions from propaganda such as high art, monuments, and novels intended mainly for the civilian population that the vast majority of Napoleon’s troops never saw or experienced.¹⁵ Works that analyze the mentalities of the grognards tend to concentrate on their writings and experiences without exploring the environment of the army that surrounded them.¹⁶ These omissions are important because it necessary to understand the relationship between the attitudes of French soldiers and the military culture in which they were immersed to ascertain how motivation functioned in Napoleon’s armies. The meanings of rewards or references in the writings of French troops may remain obscure or be misunderstood unless the cultural framework that enveloped them is studied. Furthermore, the Napoleonic regime deliberately tried to isolate the army from the civilian population, and the army spent most of the Napoleonic wars away from France. It was usually abroad conducting new campaigns or garrisoned in the territories that it conquered. Consequently, the military culture of the army differed from the more general culture of war that Napoleon and his supporters constructed in France.\n\nAnother lacuna in the military history of Napoleonic France is the absence of gender analyses. Gender history attempts to trace the evolution of gender identities created around biological sex differences, and to analyze the role of these identities in historical developments. Put more simply, gender historians study ideas and practices related to femininity, masculinity, and transgender identities, and try to determine how they affected history.¹⁷ Prominent scholars in the fields of gender studies, women’s history, and military history have recognized that war and gender are intimately connected, and have challenged historians to discover the ways in which they intersect and shape one another. Responding to this challenge, increasing numbers of historical studies explore the relationship among war, military institutions, masculinity, and femininity.¹⁸\n\nIn the history of the Napoleonic era, however, relatively little work has been done on this subject. Well-known historians of masculinity such as Robert A. Nye and George L. Mosse characterize the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars as a formative period in the history of modern masculinity in which the concept of the citizen soldier came to define manhood in the West. Yet, their own research generally concentrates on the forms of masculinity that emerged in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and does not adequately explain how this change occurred.¹⁹ Karen Hagemann’s pioneering research reveals the ways in which gender influenced Prussian participation in the Napoleonic wars, and the effects of these conflicts on German masculinity.²⁰ Yet, a comparable study of Napoleonic France does not exist. The feminist historians who have done so much to enhance our knowledge of the French Revolution and Napoleonic France through gender history generally ignore military topics.²¹ For their part, historians who have written about Napoleon’s soldiers and military campaigns neglect the role of gender in the French war effort.\n\nWhile many military historians remain uncomfortable with gender history, attitudes and behaviors related to masculinity form an essential component of military culture and military motivation. Throughout history, men performed their military obligations in and out of combat because they tried to conform to accepted standards of male behavior in their military forces or society at large. Illustrating this tendency, a study conducted by the United States military on the battlefield performance of American soldiers in World War II reported that the code of the combat soldier can be summarized by saying that behavior in combat was recognized as a test of being a man. When this code was internalized, or enforced by playing on an internalized code of manliness, a man once in combat had to fight in order to keep his own self-respect: ‘Hell, I’m a soldier.’²² Although manhood in the West has often been associated with the ability to wage war, masculine norms, of course, varied across time periods, cultures, societies, and military forces. For example, the wigs, lace, and hose worn by the aristocratic military officers of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, and the elegant manners that they cultivated, would probably be regarded as effeminate by the American soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today. It is the obligation of the historian to analyze these differences, and explore their effects on war, military forces, and the development of masculinity. To understand the motivation of Napoleon’s soldiers, it is therefore imperative to discover the forms of manhood that existed in the armies of the Consulate and the Empire, and their impact on French troops.\n\nThis book fulfills this task by engaging in a thorough analysis of the motivational system developed in three different armies: the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, the Army of Hanover, and the Grande Armée of 1805-1808. Napoleon assembled the first two armies in 1803 to strike at England after the collapse of the Peace of Amiens. The Grande Armée was formed out of the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean and the Army of Hanover once a general European war began in 1805, known as the War of the Third Coalition. These armies are historically significant for two reasons. First, they reveal the ways in which Napoleon sought to alter the character of the army once he had established his political power in France. The first few years of the Consulate represent a transitional phase in which Napoleon shared power in the French state with political rivals, and in the military with powerful generals such as Jean Victor Moreau and Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte. By 1803, Napoleon was in firm control of both politics and the military, and possessed the opportunity to solidify his hold over the army. Secondly, these armies won Napoleon’s greatest and most important victories. In slightly less than three years, the Grande Armée crushed the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, and Russia in a series of rapid campaigns that were unprecedented in their speed and decisiveness. Even more significant, the victories of the Grande Armée allowed Napoleon to establish French hegemony in Europe through the Peace of Tilsit in 1807. In the words of one of the leading historians of Napoleon’s empire, the Grande Army was the crucial instrument of French aggrandizement and . . . the victories of 1805-1807 opened the way to a process of continental empire-building which had not been practicable before.²³\n\nTwo conceptual models are used in this book to provide a framework for the study of these armies: sustaining motivation and military culture. The concept of sustaining motivation was first developed by John A. Lynn in his work on the armies of"
