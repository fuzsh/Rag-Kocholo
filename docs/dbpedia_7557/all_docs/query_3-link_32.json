Horward, Professor Emeritus of History, Florida State University, after discussions with the current Prince d’Essling and duc de Rivoli Victor-André Masséna, descendent of Marshal Masséna. Dr. Horward dedicated his career to studying Masséna, mentoring graduate students and promoting Napoleonic scholarship at Florida State and elsewhere, particularly at institutions educating military officers. The Society focuses on mentoring graduate students in Napoleonic and Revolutionary diplomatic, political, and military history. The Masséna Society is unaffiliated with any university or institution. Membership is by invitation, and the Society’s activities are supported by donations."
