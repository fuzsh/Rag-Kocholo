The church, from the summit of which Masséna and Berthier observed the Austrian positions, and which was destroyed during the fighting, has since been rebuilt. Just opposite this church, mounted on the wall of a building still bearing the trace of a shot fired during the battle, is the commemorative plaque.\n\nThe plaque\n\nA translation of the speech, delivered in German by the Prince d'Essling before a clearly-moved audience, is available here in English:"
