        "text": "Statue de Massena au Louvre Photo: wikimedia.org\n\nToday we will continue and finish the story started in the article. Andr√© Massena. \"A child spoiled by victories\".\n\nGeneral Barthelemy Joubert, who was chosen as his \"sword\" by director Sieyes, died fighting against Suvorov in the battle of Novi (August 15, 1799). This was discussed in the article Fatum of General Joubert... However, soon another young, but very ambitious and determined general appeared in Paris.\n\nThe directory was doomed. Less than three months after the death of Joubert, Bonaparte, who returned from Egypt, became First Consul and quickly pushed the experienced intriguer Sieyes into the background and even the third place. The opinions of authoritative generals about the coup of 18-19 Brumaire were divided.\n\nMassena, who was at that time with his army in Northern Italy, supported Napoleon. He even removed from their posts the generals Victor and Lemoine subordinate to him, who dared to speak out openly against the actual usurpation of power by Bonaparte. True, Mass√©na did not approve of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking the post of First Consul for life.\n\nNapoleon appreciated his loyalty by appointing the commander of the Italian army. Here Massena was opposed by the Austrian general Melas, who was at the head of the one hundred thousandth Ligurian army.\n\nMassena in Italy\n\nTaking advantage of Massena's oversight, the Austrians defeated the divisions of Soult and Suchet that had separated from the main army.\n\nMassena himself from April 20, 1800 was blockaded in Genoa. In order to establish contact with Suchet and try to coordinate actions, the chief of staff of Massena's army, General Oudinot, then at the risk of his life passed through the line of British ships in a small boat. But Genoa, besieged by the Austrian troops of von Botarkez, was doomed.\n\nAt the end of May, famine began in the city. Seeing no other way out, on June 4, Massena signed an honorary surrender agreement, according to the terms of which the French left Genoa with weapons and banners unfurled.\n\nNobody particularly reproached Massena for surrendering the city. Lord Keith, who commanded an English squadron near Genoa, even said in 1800 that Massena alone was worth 20 thousand people. And Bonaparte later transferred the command of his army to him.\n\nHowever, when signing the treaty, Massena did not know that already on June 14, Napoleon would defeat the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo. If Massena had held on a little longer, he could have added the heroic defense of Genoa to the list of his military achievements.\n\nSo, Massena, after the departure of Bonaparte, was again the commander of the Italian army. But he was in this position for only 2 months.\n\nAnd again he was let down by an irrepressible passion for theft and robbery under the guise of \"indemnities\". He had to surrender the army to General Brune.\n\nReturn to Paris\n\nBy that time, Mass√©na had stolen quite enough to acquire in the vicinity of Paris the castle of Rueil, which once belonged to Cardinal Richelieu. Nearby, by the way, is the famous Malmaison.\n\nMassena did not accept the signing in July 1801 of the concordat with the Vatican (on the restoration of the rights of the Catholic Church in France), and he was not afraid to speak out against this idea publicly. In Paris, they discussed for a long time the scandal arranged in 1802 in the Notre Dame Cathedral by Massena, Augereau and some of their like-minded people.\n\nHaving been forced to carry out Napoleon's order to attend the Easter service, they demonstratively came to the cathedral with weapons, and then took the chairs from the priests who were sitting on them (and sat down on them themselves). However, Bonaparte needed experienced and authoritative generals, and therefore he tolerated their antics.\n\nAnd what happened if you think about it?\n\nThe peasants in the temple of God made a prank - after all, when executing his personal order, and not just like that. He told them to go and pray - go and pray (as they could and how it happened). Loyalty has been demonstrated, and the rest is the tenth thing. After the establishment of the Order of the Legion of Honor, Massena first received an officer's cross, and then the highest insignia.\n\nIn July 1803 Bonaparte favored the fact that Massena was elected a member of the Legislative Corps. Finally, on May 19, 1804, the day after Napoleon's coronation, Massena becomes Marshal of France.\n\nMass√©na in the campaigns of 1805‚Äì1807.\n\nIn 1805, the so-called War of the Third Coalition began. Massena is 47 years old - a respectable age for those times. Health is not the same, gout brings special torment. Nevertheless, on May 30, the marshal is ordered to go to Milan and take command of the Italian army. Here his opponent again became the Archduke Charles, whose army outnumbered the French by three times.\n\nSeptember 30 - October 1 of that year, the French and Austrians near the city of Caldiero met in the main battle of the Italian campaign. The Austrian army then had a double superiority in manpower and a triple superiority in artillery pieces. The city passed from hand to hand three times. Despite his age and illness, Massena, riding on a stallion named Sultan, again, as in his youth, personally led the attacks of his troops. In the end, the Austrians retreated.\n\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon ordered Massena to attack the Kingdom of Naples, which he planned to transfer to his brother Joseph. Naples fell on February 15, 1806. Massena then captured Gaeta and drove John Stewart's English division out of Calabria.\n\nIn general, Marshal Mass√©na was good to everyone, but in his account in one of the banks in Livorno, in a few weeks, three million francs, who had come from nowhere, again ‚Äúmagically‚Äù appeared (well, nothing can be done: he loved and, most importantly, he knew how to ‚Äúmake money‚Äù this person). General Solignac, the chief of staff of his army, had more modest loot, as befits a subordinate - six hundred thousand.\n\n\"Well-wishers\" immediately reported these \"miracles\" to the emperor, who turned to Massena and Solignac with a \"proposal that cannot be refused\" - to share \"back-breaking labor\": one million to the treasury from Massena and two hundred thousand from Solignac.\n\nMassena unexpectedly turned out to be a very dull person: instead of giving up a third of the loot, he began to talk about high expenses, debts and complain about a hard life. Napoleon did not appreciate his stories and confiscated the entire amount (which turned out to be even more than the estimated one - three million six hundred thousand francs). They said that the marshal then even got sick from chagrin.\n\nIn 1807, Massena ended up in Poland, but did not take part in any significant battle.\n\nNevertheless, after the conclusion of the Tilsit Peace Treaty, Napoleon grants him the title of Duke of Rivoli (decree of April 24, 1808).\n\nFontaine et Gros. Andre Massena\n\n\"Tsar's hunt\"\n\nFrom July 1807 to early 1809 Massena did not hold any official posts and enjoyed an idle life at the Ruei Castle, periodically traveling to Paris - to the court of the emperor. I must say that he did not like the court order too much. But he hunted in the surrounding forests with great pleasure. Ironically, it was during the imperial hunt that this marshal was wounded, from the consequences of which he suffered all his life.\n\nIn September 1808 near Fontainebleau, after Napoleon's unsuccessful shot, one of the pellets hit Massena's left eye. To avoid a scandal, he blamed the injury ... Berthier, whose gun was not even loaded. This marshal also turned out to be a smart man and immediately admitted his guilt. This was the end of the investigation of this incident. And the pains - headaches and in the damaged eye socket, remained with Massena. And bothered him for the rest of his life.\n\nCombat campaign of 1809\n\nIn March 1809, Massena went to another war with Austria. This time he was entrusted with the command of the IV Corps.\n\nVienna was taken in May, but Archduke Charles saved his army from defeat by leading it to the left bank of the Danube. Napoleon decided to finish off the Austrians. For this, a pontoon bridge was built to the island of Lobau, and from it to the other side of the river. On the evening of May 20, two corps - Lanna and Massena - managed to cross it. After that, the bridge collapsed and two French corps were faced with a hundred thousandth Austrian army. Thus began the battle of Esling (Aspern), in which Marshal Lann was mortally wounded, and Massena once again demonstrated both his personal courage and the talent of a commander. All his adjutants were killed or wounded, the horse on which the marshal was sitting was literally torn apart by a cannonball.\n\nNapoleon later said:\n\n\"Who has not seen Massena in Aspern, he has not seen anything.\"\n\nKeith Rocco. \"Battle of Aspern\"\n\nAs a result, the French managed to evacuate their troops, and the war ended with the bloody battle of Wagram (July 5-6, 1809).\n\nK. Vernet. \"Battle of Wagram\"\n\nIn the battle of Wagram, Massena's corps was on the left flank, and the marshal himself led the battle from an open carriage drawn by four horses, as he injured his leg when he fell from a horse.\n\nSuch an irony of fate: Massena risked his life in dozens of battles, and was wounded only twice - on a hunt personally by the Emperor Bonaparte and under Wagram ... by a horse.\n\nNapoleon praised Massena's actions: on January 31, 1810, he received the title of Prince of Esling (recall that since 1808, this marshal was also a duke).\n\nMassena in Portugal: the war against Wellington, Junot and Ney\n\nAlready on April 17, 1810, Massena was appointed commander of the Portuguese army. By that time, General Junot, Marshals Soult and Victor had managed to fight in this country, but none of them achieved much success. All of them were jealous of the glory of their rivals, and once Victor did not help Soult, who was in a very difficult situation.\n\nThe 52-year-old Massena arrived at the headquarters with another mistress - Anrietta Leberton, the sister of one of the adjutants, which infuriated Junot's wife. The venerable general's wife was forced to sit next to a \"public woman\" who was called \"Massena's chicken\" in the army. Junot took the side of his wife, and the relationship between the marshal and the general did not work out right away.\n\nAnother corps commander of the Portuguese army, Michel Ney, also greeted Massena and his \"coolerina\" very coldly. At one of the dinners, with his ridicule, he even brought Anrietta to a swoon.\n\nI must say that this capricious and selfish lady really does not cause sympathy. The movements and actions of the French army often depended on Leberton's mood and well-being. Once, during an offensive in Portugal, she forgot her parrot in one of the villages. And the army stopped, waiting until a specially sent hussar squadron brought the bird to the mistress.\n\nIn general, opposition to the new commander immediately formed, which did not contribute to success. And the main culprit of this situation, perhaps, should be recognized precisely Massena, who, as a commander, should still think about the most rational and effective implementation of the tasks assigned to him, and not about how to please the young favorite better.\n\nAt that time, the French military leaders exchanged such \"nice\" letters among themselves.\n\nNey - Massenet:\n\n\"I am the same marshal as you, and your title of Prince of Esling is valid only within the Tuileries Palace.\"\n\nMassena to Ney:\n\n\"I will make you shut your words back down your throat.\"\n\nIn Portugal, in addition to the Portuguese proper, the British were also opposed to the French from 1808. The combined army was led by Arthur Wellesley, better known as the Duke of Wellington.\n\nMassena, meanwhile, somehow forced his opponents to submit to himself, and in the summer of 1810, finally, his army went on the offensive, capturing Alameida and Ciudad Rodrigo. However, further advancement was hampered by the scorched earth tactics that Wellesley practiced.\n\nOnly on September 27, on the Busako ridge, he entered into a battle with the French - and won it. But then he retreated again, reaching the well-fortified Torres-Vedras line by October 14. The French did not have the strength to storm, and it would be wiser to withdraw the army to winter quarters. But Massena left her in place, as a result of which the French suffered heavy losses from cold and disease. By the spring of 1811, the army was already in such a state that on March 5, Massena was forced to give the order to retreat.\n\nThe second attempt to conquer Portugal was also unsuccessful. This time, Mass√©na's quarrel with Bessi√®res, who at first refused to help with ammunition, turned out to be fatal. And at the decisive moment of the battle near the village of Fuentes d'Ognoro, when victory was close, the cavalry general Lepic, subordinate to Bessi√®res, refused to attack the British who were already ready to retreat. So Massena was unable to enter history as the only Marshal of Napoleon to defeat Wellington.\n\nAfter that, dissatisfied with Massena's failures, Napoleon removed him from command. Meanwhile, Wellington himself later admitted that none of Bonaparte's marshals had caused him so much trouble. He called Massena \"The Old Fox\" and said that it was during the war with him that he turned gray.\n\nThe last years of the life of Marshal Massena\n\nNapoleon completely lost interest in Massena and therefore did not give him any assignment during the campaign of 1812.\n\nHe did not use this marshal during the campaigns of 1813-1814.\n\nAfter Napoleon's abdication, Massena took the oath of allegiance to the Bourbons and was assigned to the 8th Military District (Marseille), as well as the Commander's Cross of the Order of St. Louis. Since Nice, of which Massena was a native, was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1814, Louis XVIII granted him French citizenship on December 29 of the same year. This, incidentally, offended the marshal, who had long considered himself French.\n\nIn material terms, the marshal was by no means poor. After his death in 1817, it turned out that he left 40 million francs to his heirs.\n\nWhile in Marseille, Massena was the first of the Napoleonic marshals to learn about the emperor's landing in the Gulf of Juan (March 1, 1815). This news plunged him into confusion.\n\nOn the one hand, he didn't particularly like Bourbons. On the other hand, he understood that the return of Napoleon was a big war and the end of his peaceful life. At first he tried to delay the emperor's advance, but he was late: Bonaparte's small detachment was already far away. It soon became clear that the Legitimists were defeated, and on April 10, Massena arrived in Paris, where he met with Napoleon.\n\nThe reception turned out to be cold, he did not receive any appointment. Nevertheless, on June 1, Massena was invited to the celebration of the Renaissance of the Empire. In total, 11 of the 23 remaining marshals were present there. And on June 4, Napoleon bestowed the title of peerage of France on 10 marshals, including Massenet.\n\nOnly after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo did Massena receive the post of commander of the capital's National Guard (and even then not from the emperor).\n\nWhen Napoleon abdicated for the second time, Massena went to his castle Ruay, from where he turned to the Ministry of War with a request to allow him to go to Italy (Tuscany) for treatment. Under a plausible pretext, he wanted to leave the country, hoping to wait out the period of repression. He, as military governor of Marseille, was suspected of secretly facilitating the landing of Bonaparte (this was not true), as well as embezzlement of public funds in Provence (which seems to be true - Massena stole everywhere, why Provence should have been an exception).\n\nBut nothing happened, and Massena retained his titles and property. He in every possible way avoided the obligation to judge Ney and experienced great relief when he demanded a court of the House of Peers. In the end, 5 Napoleonic marshals voted for the death penalty, Mass√©na was not among them.\n\nAt the end of 1816, the Marshal's health deteriorated significantly. The denouement came on April 4, 1817: Andr√© Massena died, a little before the age of 59. Like many Napoleonic marshals, he was buried in the Pere Lachaise cemetery.\n\nCurrently, one of the boulevards in Paris and a square in his native Nice are named after him.\n\nAt the turn of the 1919th and XNUMXth centuries, Massena's grandson built a villa in Nice, which his son (the great-grandson of the hero of the article) handed over to the city in XNUMX on the condition that it would house the Marshal's museum, and the surrounding garden would be accessible for the townspeople to walk.\n\nMusee massena\n\nAt present, only a part of the exposition is devoted to Andr√© Massena and everything connected with him (there are, for example, Bonaparte's personal belongings and Josephine Beauharnais's gold watch). Most of the exhibition tells about the history of the city of Nice.\n\nRyzhov V.A.\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n134 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion ‚ÄúFreedom of Russia‚Äù (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n‚ÄúNon-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,‚Äù as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: ‚ÄúMedusa‚Äù; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
