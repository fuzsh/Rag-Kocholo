        "text": "Description\n\nType: Document\n\nDescription: (1758-1817) military commander in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, one of original 18 Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon. He had no formal education, rising from humble origins to prominence. Napoleon called him “the greatest name of my military empire”, his career equaled by few commanders in European history.\n\nBorn in Nice, then in the Kingdom of Sardinia, son of a shopkeeper, at 13 became a cabin boy on a merchant ship. In 1775, after 4 years at sea, he enlisted in the Army as a private in the Royal Italian Regiment. When he left in 1789, Masséna had risen to warrant officer, highest rank available to non-noblemen. He rejoined the army 1791, made an officer, rising to colonel 1792. When the Revolutionary Wars broke out in April 1792, he was at the Piedmont border. In October, a month after Nice’s occupation, his volunteer battalion was one of 4 in the French Army of Italy.\n\nDistinguishing himself in battle, promoted to brigade general August 1793, general of division December. Prominent in every Italian Riviera campaign in the next 2 years, when Bonaparte took command in March 1796, Masséna led 2 divisions of the army’s advance guard. He was one of Bonaparte’s most important generals in the 1796-97 Italian Campaign, significant in spring battles of Montenotte and Dego, and at summer and fall battles of Lonato, Castiglione, Bassano, Caldiero and Arcola, as well as Rivoli and the fall of Manuta that winter. When an Austrian relief army went to aid Mantua in Jan. 1797, the French were overrun near Rivoli, other enemy columns advancing on Verona and Mantua. On 13 January, Masséna marched from Verona to Rivoli, 15 miles away. After a forced night march across snow-covered roads, his men reached the battlefield at 6am. Bonaparte deployed them on the left flank when the battle began, shifting them to support the sagging center, then deployed them to crush an Austrian flanking maneuver. His troops played a decisive role in the victory. The next day, with little rest, his troops marched 39 miles in 24 hours to intercept a 2nd Austrian army advancing to relieve Mantua. At La Favorita, he closed the pincer on the Austrians, forcing their surrender; in 5 five days, Masséna’s division left over 35,000 Austrian soldiers either dead or captured. Two weeks later, the 30,000-man garrison at Mantua surrendered. With his final victory complete, Napoleon praised Masséna with the name “l’enfant chéri de la victoire”.\n\nIn 1799, as Russian reinforcements marched to support Austrian armies in Italy and Switzerland, the Directory consolidated remnants of the armies under Masséna and with 90,000 men, he was sent to defend the entire frontier. He stopped the Austrian advance on Zurich in June, then left the city and took up positions in the surrounding mountains. He defeated Russian General Korsakov at the 2nd Battle of Zurich in September, then, aware of Suvorov’s advance toward St. Gotthard, shifted his troops south. General Lecourbe’s division delayed the Russians at Gotthard Pass and when Suvorov forced his way through, he was met by Soult’s division blocking the route at Altdorf. Unable to break through French lines and aware of Korsakov’s defeat, Suvorov went east through the difficult Pragel Pass where more French troops awaited him on 4 October. In waist-deep snow, his troops tried 6 times to break through French lines along the Linth River, each time beaten back. Suvorov escaped over the Panix Pass, abandoning baggage and artillery, losing some 5,000 men; this helped cause Russia’s withdrawal from the 2nd Coalition.\n\nIn 1800, Masséna was besieged at Genoa by the Austrians, while Bonaparte marched with the Army of the Reserve to Milan. By the end of May, plague spread throughout Genoa, the civilian population in revolt. On 4 June, with a day’s rations left, Masséna agreed to evacuate from Genoa but if “capitulation” was mentioned or written, he threatened to end negotiations. Two days later, the bulk of Masséna’s starving and exhausted troops marched out with their equipment and followed the coast road toward France, ending the near 60 day siege, an awesome demonstration of tenacity, ingenuity, courage, and daring that garnered additional laurels for Masséna.\n\nBy forcing the Austrians to deploy vast forces against him at Genoa, Masséna allowed Bonaparte to cross Great St. Bernard Pass, surprise the Austrians, and ultimately defeat them at Marengo before reinforcements could be transferred from the siege site. Under 3 weeks later, Masséna was made commander of French forces in Italy although Napoleon thought he gave up Genoa to early. Masséna regained Napoleon’s trust in 1804, made Marshal of the Empire in May. He led an independent army that captured Verona and fought the Austrians 30 Oct. 1805 at Caldiero. Masséna led operations against the Kingdom of Naples and led the Grand Army’s right wing in Poland 1807. He was named 1st Duke of Rivoli 24 Aug. 1808. In 1808, Masséna was accidentally shot during a hunting expedition and lost the use of an eye. Returning to active duty 1809 against 5th Coalition forces, he led IV Corps at Eckmuhl and Ebersberg. Later in the war, when Napoleon tried to cross to the north bank of the Danube at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Masséna’s troops held the village of Aspern in 2 days of savage fighting, rewarded 31 Jan. 1810 with a 2nd victory title, Prince of Essling for his efforts there and in the Battle of Wagram.\n\nDuring the Peninsular War, Napoleon appointed him Commander of the Army of Portugal in 1810. Masséna captured Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida after successful sieges, but suffered a setback by Wellington’s Anglo-Portuguese army at Bucaco 27 Sept. He forced the Allies to retreat into the Lines of Torres Vedras where a stalemate ensued for several months. Forced to retreat due to lack of food and supplies, he withdrew to the Spanish frontier, prompting Napoleon’s ire. After suffering defeats at Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, he was replaced by Marshal Marmont and became local commander at Marseilles.\n\nMasséna kept his command after the Bourbon Restoration but when Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, he refused to commit to either side. The day after Napoleon’s 2nd abdication, he was named head of the Paris National Guard by the Provisional Government, replaced in the Bourbon Restoration.\n\nMassena, New York and Massena, Iowa, are named for him.\n\n9 x 12 ¼ partly printed engraved DS, Padua, 16 Brumaire Year 6 of the Republic (Nov. 7, 1797), French Republic Army of Italy 65th Demi Brigade, 3nd Battalion, 2nd Company of Grenadiers.

In 1814 he held the fortress of Gorinchem (Gorkum) in present-day Netherlands to 7 Feb. when he was forced to surrender to the Prussians. Rampon rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days, fell out of favor with the Bourbons to 1819 when his title was restored. His name is inscribed in Column 24 under the Arc de Triomphe."
