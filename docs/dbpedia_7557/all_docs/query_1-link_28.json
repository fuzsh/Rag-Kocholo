        "text": "Maximilien Foy (born Feb. 3, 1775, Ham, Fr.—died Nov. 28, 1825, Paris) was a French military leader, writer, and statesman who rose through the ranks of the imperial army during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15) and then emerged as a leading spokesman of the liberal opposition during the early years after the Bourbon Restoration (1815).\n\nFoy served in the artillery and the infantry, attaining the rank of major in 1796, staff colonel in 1799, and brigadier general in 1808. He voted against the Consulate and against the Empire, but his exceptional military abilities kept him in the service of Napoleon’s armies. He distinguished himself in the Rhineland and the Middle East and especially in less successful campaigns in Portugal and Spain. After Napoleon’s final defeat at Waterloo (1815), Foy retired from military life and published what was to remain an incomplete Histoire des guerres de la Péninsule (1819; History of the Peninsular War, Under Napoleon). In 1819 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the Aisne département, where he led the liberal opposition until his death."
