        "text": "Andre Massena\n\nFrench Marshal\n\nPrince de Essling\n\nDuc de Rivoli\n\n1758-1817\n\nOriginally eager to go to sea, Andre Massena found life on the waves was not what it should be and so set out for a career in the French army.\n\nVery quickly he discovered he had made the right choice and rose rapidly to sergeant. Despite his promise, the army released Massena in 1789 and he took up smuggling on the Cote d'Azure.\n\nWithin two years, however, the call of the drums took him back to the army and he joined the National Guard and was voted in as colonel.\n\nBy 1793, he was a general of division and his abilities gave him first battle victory at Lonato in 1795.\n\nAfter that, Massena teamed up with a young General Napoleon Bonaparte and was a key soldier in the stunning 1796 Campaign and the battles of Montenotte, Lodi, Castiglione, Bassano, Caldiero, Arcola, and Rivoli.\n\nIn 1799, Massena took command of the army in Switzerland and ran into Russia's Field Marshal Suvarov at the second battle of Zurich.\n\nVictorious, his reputation soared and even the harrowing siege and eventual surrender of his men at Genoa could not tarnish it.\n\nHe succeeded Bonaparte as commander of the Army of Italy, but his unashamed looting required his almost instant dismissal.\n\nAll was forgiven in time and in 1804 he became a marshal and a year later had taken Verona and fought at Caldiero.\n\nGiven command of the campaign against Naples he was recalled, again for massive pillaging, and had his loot taken from him by the emperor.\n\nIn the Danube campaign of 1809, Massena again put soldiering first and proved his abilities at Landshut, Eckmuhl, Ebelsberg, Aspern-Essling, Wagram and Znaim. His courage and skill at Aspern-Essling earned him the title Prince d'Essling.\n\nFrom Austria, Massena was moved to Spain, together with his mistress who dressed as a dragoon, and found himself sorely tested by British troops in the Peninsular War.\n\nHis first taste was at Bussaco, where he was given a brutal lesson by the Duke of Wellington, and then again at Fuentes d'Onoro."
