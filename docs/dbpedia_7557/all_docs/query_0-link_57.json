        "text": "Major Figures\n\nCharles Dumouriez\n\nAfter enjoying success as a military commander during the French Revolution, Charles François Dumouriez (1739–1823) suffered a grievous blow to his reputation when he betrayed his nation to enter into a treasonous agreement with Austria.\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nAs a young man, Dumouriez pursued an education at the college of Louis-le-Grand, and in 1757 he entered military service as a volunteer in the campaign of Rossbach. He performed with distinction, earning a commission and later serving in campaigns during the Seven Years War in Germany.\n\nWith the suspension of hostilities, he retired as a captain. Through his travels, Dumouriez developed an interest in the Mediterranean. His writing on Corsican affairs earned him a position on the staff of the French expeditionary corps, and he was sent to the island at the rank of lieutenant colonel. A staunch royalist, Dumouriez became actively engaged in diplomatic political affairs.\n\nDumouriez then joined Louis XV’s secret service, and in this capacity he traveled on a mission to Poland to assist pro-French organizations. Upon the fall of the powerful state minister Étienne François, duc de Choiseul, Dumouriez was recalled to France and eventually imprisoned, not gaining his full release until the accession of Louis XVI in 1774. He married his cousin Mademoiselle de Broissy upon his release, but the union was unhappy and the two eventually separated.\n\nA substantial pamphlet Dumouriez penned regarding the security of Normandy gained him a posting as commandant of Cherbourg in 1778. He proved to be an able administrator and made a number of civic improvements, which kept him in place for the next ten years. However, he felt his career was stagnating and so began looking for fresh opportunities.\n\nMilitary Successes\n\nThe outbreak of the Revolution provided the chance he was seeking, so Dumouriez traveled to Paris and joined the initially moderate Jacobin Club. Dumouriez was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and he offered his services to King Louis XVI. In March 1792, he became minister of foreign affairs in a ministry that included several Girondists who sought war with Austria.\n\nDumouriez contributed to the decision to declare war against Austria, and his deliberations fashioned the campaign plan to invade the Low Countries. With a change in cabinet members in June 1792, he briefly became the minister of war. But when King Louis failed to reach an accommodation with the Assembly, Dumouriez left Paris to join the army of Marshal Luckner.\n\nIn August, as the Prussians and Austrians took to the offensive against France, Dumouriez, as commander of the “Army of the Centre,” took decisive action and scored several important victories for the Revolutionary government. In September, his subordinate, General François Christophe Kellerman, inflicted a defeat on the Prussians at Valmy, and in November, Dumouriez surprised the Austrian army in winter quarters near Jemappes. Dumouriez’s 45,000 Frenchmen, who outnumbered his enemies by three to one, routed the Austrians and subsequently captured Brussels.\n\nWhen Dumouriez returned to Paris, he enjoyed many accolades, but the radicals in power did not favor him. He was too deliberate and his passion not extreme enough for the ruling Jacobins. Dumouriez recognized that a defeat in battle would not only ruin his career but endanger his person.\n\nThat defeat came at Neerwinden in the winter of 1793. To stave off what he felt was the inevitable censure and sacking, he arrested the commissioners sent by the Convention that spring to investigate his performance. Dumouriez passed his captives to his enemies as a token of his sincerity of his new allegiance but failed to convince his army to march against the Revolutionary government in Paris. Left with no other choice but flight, Dumouriez—along with the duc de Chartres (afterwards King Louis-Philippe) and his brother the duc de Montpensier—fled into the hands of the Austrians.\n\nDumouriez spent his remaining years without a national homeland, finally serving the British government and trying to justify his record. In 1804 he settled in England and received an annual pension of 1,200 British pounds. During the Napoleonic Wars, Dumouriez secretly advised the British War Office about French military affairs. He solicited a marshal’s baton from Louis XVIII but the French monarch refused to grant the honor.\n\nDumouriez was an avid writer, especially of political pamphlets. His memoirs were first published in 1794, while a second, larger edition, La Vie et les mémoires du Général Dumouriez, was published in Paris in 1823, the year of his death.\n\nFrançois Kellermann\n\nFrançois Christophe Kellermann, Duke of Valmy and French Marshal of the Empire (1735–1820), achieved fame for saving the French Revolution by winning the Battle of Valmy. In reality a military commander of modest accomplishment, he spent his later years demonstrating thoroughly successful administrative skills in the armies of Napoleon.\n\nA Soldier’s Life\n\nKellerman entered military service as a cadet in the Lowendahl Regiment in 1752. Four years later he was a captain of dragoons and saw service in the Seven Years War, distinguishing himself at Bergen in April 1759 and at Freidberg in Hesse in August 1762. In 1771, Kellerman served with Baron de Viomeuil in the Franco-German expeditionary force sent to Poland. During the withdrawal from Cracow, Kellerman displayed his talent by capably managing his formation during difficult conditions. In 1780 he earned a promotion to lieutenant colonel, and in 1784 he became a brigadier.\n\nPromoted to major general, Kellerman embraced the Revolution and commanded the Department of Alsace, where the steps he took to train and organize his forces earned him yet another promotion, to lieutenant general. He was commander in chief at Neukirk in early 1792, and in the summer he transferred to command the Army of the Moselle.\n\nKellermann’s most notable achievement came at the Battle of Valmy on September 20, 1792. There, he took a blocking position that thwarted an anti-Revolutionary invasion force composed of Austrians, Hessians, and Prussians under the Duke of Brunswick. Kellermann largely held his infantry in place while unleashing a magnificent cannonade that compelled Brunswick’s Prussians to withdraw with little maneuvering. This action was credited with saving the Revolutionary government and preserving the integrity of France.\n\nAs a reward, Kellermann was given command of the Army of the Alps, but due to political intrigues he was arrested in June 1793. He spent thirteen months imprisoned before rejoining the armies in Italy. He was relieved in October 1795 and made inspector general of cavalry.\n\nOrganizational Acumen\n\nGradually passed by younger, more aggressive generals in Napoleon’s service, Kellerman’s steady hand and organizational abilities were still sought for other duties. He became a senator and then president of the senate, later becoming the first of four senators to be named Marshal of France. He commanded the III Corps of the Army of Reserve on the Rhine in 1803, and in 1806 he commanded the Rhine Army of Reserve.\n\nIn 1808, Kellermann commanded several observation and garrison armies, and in 1812 Napoleon tasked him with the reorganization of the National Guard. In the wake of the invasion of Russia, Kellerman again commanded the Rhine Observation Corps. Subsequently he commanded the Second, Third, and Fourth Military Divisions.\n\nIn 1814, King Louis XVIII made Kellermann a peer of France, and in 1815 Napoleon also made him a peer. He died in Paris in September 1820.\n\nKellermann’s prominence was due in large measure to his moment of glory as the hero of Valmy. Although not a large battle in military terms, the fight preserved the Revolution at a tenuous moment when Paris was vulnerable to attack by the other powers of Europe. Throughout his career, Kellermann remained faithful to France, and his significant administrative skills and long experience with French military affairs were valued and sought after by both the Revolutionary and Napoleonic governments.\n\nJean-Baptiste Jourdan\n\nJean-Baptiste Jourdan (1762–1833) was a Marshal of France who compiled a career of successful, if not particularly distinguished, service spanning the period from the American Revolution through the end of the Napoleonic era. He was a tradition-bound, unimaginative, but steady commander.\n\nTwo Continents, Two Revolutions\n\nWhile still an adolescent, Jourdan enlisted as a private soldier for service under the great Marquis de Lafayette in the American War of Independence. Departing military service upon his return to France, Jourdan again volunteered upon the outbreak of the French Revolution. He enjoyed the support of politicians within the Republican government in Paris who were in dire need of proven military leaders, and so he earned quick promotion. He soon found himself at the head of division, and then was appointed commander in chief of the Army of the North, winning against an Austrian force at Wattignies in northern France in October 1793. The battle itself was unremarkable, yet any victory by the still raw troops of Republican France was heralded.\n\nAfter a period of political uncertainty during which his enthusiasm for the Revolution came under suspicion by the political masters in Paris, Jourdan returned to the army, and in June, at the Battle of Fleurus, he earned a substantial victory for the Revolution and achieved his most important triumph as a military leader. At the head of a new combined force of more than 75,000 men known as the Army of the Sambre and Meuse, Jourdan marched against the city of Charleroi, located some six miles southwest of Fleurus. On June 12, the French force invested the town, but the siege was short-lived. On June 16, an Austrian-Dutch force counterattacked with more than forty thousand troops, inflicting several thousand casualties and prompting Jourdan to fall back. Two days later Jourdan counterattacked, this time successfully compelling the city’s surrender.\n\nThe same day, the Austrian commander General Josias Saxe-Coburg, at the head of a fifty thousand man force, struck the flanks of Jourdan’s army, gaining ground on each side. However, the Austrian and Dutch troops were unable to budge the French center, thus the assault stalled. Although Saxe-Coburg had inflicted greater casualties than his army had suffered, he lost his confidence and ordered a general retirement, soon marching beyond the Meuse. Jourdan’s “triumph” prompted the Allies’ withdrawal from Belgium, which French forces exploited by marching into the Netherlands, taking Brussels on July 10 and entering Antwerp on July 27.\n\nThe year 1795 saw Jourdan campaigning with little effect along the line of the Rhine, and in 1796 he was again leading a wing of the French army. The Directory in Paris replaced appointed General Jean Victor Moreau and designated that he and Jourdan lead a combined offensive. The Austrian commander in chief, Archduke Charles, blunted Jourdan’s advance, but Moreau was able to maneuver behind the Austrian army, compelling Charles’ retreat beyond the Danube. Jourdan attempted to exploit the French success, but at Amberg on August 24 and again at Wurzburg on September 3, Charles stopped Jourdan’s thrusts. Thus the campaign season along the Rhine front ended with little accomplished.\n\nCareer Under the First Consul\n\nOnce more embroiled in political affairs for a time, Jourdan returned to active service but was defeated again by Archduke Charles at the battle of Stockach in 1799. After initial opposition to the assumption of power by Napoleon, Jourdan gradually came to support the new regime and accepted from the new First Consul the position as inspector-general of cavalry and infantry. Napoleon, seeking the support of the senior military leaders of the Revolution, designated Jourdan as Marshal of France.\n\nThereafter Jourdan was assigned as commander of the Army of Italy, a post he held until September 1805. In 1806, he was governor of Naples, and in 1808, he was transferred to Spain as chief of staff of the French army fighting Wellington in the Peninsular War. The following years found him performing a number of duties: governor of Madrid in 1811, and chief of staff to King Joseph during the battles of Salamanca in 1812 and Vitoria in 1813.\n\nAfter a brief retirement, he was recalled to largely administrative commands before switching his allegiance to the Bourbons upon the monarchy’s return to power. Although he once more pledged loyalty to Napoleon during the Hundred Days, Jourdan spent his final decades serving the Bourbon government.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte\n\nNapoleon I (1769–1821), Emperor of France, was an extraordinarily gifted and dynamic statesman, reformer, and military leader. Napoleon tempered the excesses of the French Revolution only to plunge Europe into more than two decades of broader conflict. A military giant who established the largest empire in Europe since Roman times, Napoleon symbolizes both the apogee of battlefield success as well as the hazards of imperial ambition.\n\nDuring the Revolution\n\nAs a young man, Napoleon distinguished himself in geometry, science, and mathematics, and assiduously studied military history and theory. He entered the École Militaire in 1784 and a year later earned a commission in the artillery. He joined the La Fère Artillery Regiment and came under the tutelage of the commandant, who encouraged Bonaparte to develop his military skills.\n\nNapoleon became involved in Corsican nationalist politics and gradually rose in rank, earning notice for his talented employment of the artillery at the Siege of Toulon in 1793 that forced the British to withdraw. For his efforts, he gained promotion to brigadier general. Napoleon’s star seemed to be rising, but he was arrested and imprisoned after the fall of Robespierre, the famous French revolutionary.\n\nNapoleon was contemplating emigration when the politician Paul Barras ordered him to defend the Convention (the legislative body formed during the Revolution) from the mobs. For doing so with such efficiency, Bonaparte was rewarded with command of the Army of the Interior, and in 1796 he was given command of the Army of Italy. His deft maneuvering and leadership in battle earned victories that convinced the Austrians to conclude the Peace of Campo Formio (1797), allowing France to turn its hostilities to Britain.\n\nA Stop in Africa on the Way Up\n\nIn 1798, Napoleon was given command of an army that sailed across the Mediterranean, capturing Malta and landing in Egypt. After he defeated a Mameluke force at the Battle of the Pyramids, Bonaparte seized Cairo. The French position was jeopardized by destruction of the French fleet skillfully conducted by the British Admiral Nelson. Napoleon’s invasion of Syria in 1799 failed to turn around French fortunes, so he departed, leaving his army to its fate.\n\nA skillful public relations campaign kept Napoleon’s standing high with the public. As a result of a coup in 1799, he was made one of three Consuls, soon becoming the First Consul and consolidating his authority. The following year Bonaparte launched a campaign against Austrian forces in Italy, leading to victory at Marengo. As a result, Austria signed the Treaty of Luneville, terminating the Second Coalition against France. Britain, too, sought accommodation, and the Peace of Amiens brought peace to France and the opportunity for domestic reform.\n\nEver a pragmatist, Napoleon sought to gain efficiency at all levels of government. His Concordat with the Papacy brought a general reconciliation with Rome, while economic reforms—including the establishment of the Bank of France and ensuring a metal-based currency that fixed the price of the franc—served to calm social anxieties. Furthermore, French law was codified and the education system was reoriented to prepare capable young people from the middle layers of society for opportunities for public service and entry into the professions. These modernizations all enhanced Napoleon’s reputation, and a plebiscite made him Consul for life.\n\nThe Autocrat Alters Europe’s Armies\n\nNapoleon viewed himself as the successor to Charlemagne and hence promoted the creation of an Empire of France. Another plebiscite duly proclaimed him Emperor, and his coronation occurred in December 1804. In 1805 he added the title of King of Italy.\n\nWhile Napoleon’s reforms proceeded apace at home, Britain had resumed hostilities in 1803 and would orchestrate another four coalitions against France. Napoleon ultimately would find himself in a long strategic war of attrition, but he struggled mightily to avoid this kind of conflict by seeking to achieve what had eluded European military leaders for centuries: the decisive battle.\n\nNapoleon’s military system changed the nature of war in Europe, as he substantially altered the way armies were organized and employed. Formerly, armies assembled on an ad hoc basis, with each arm (infantry, cavalry, and artillery) cooperating on the field of battle but otherwise not fully integrated. Napoleon’s armies consisted of divisions and brigades that were semi-permanently task organized and capable of rapid massing on the battlefield. On the march, each of his corps was capable of independent maneuver, allowing the French army the ability to advance on parallel but separate axes. This freed Napoleon’s forces from the system of magazines and depots that had constrained previous generals. Now the French corps could live off the land more readily as they foraged separately. The result was that Napoleon could bring to the battlefield larger numbers of troops who could then mass for decisive effect.\n\nFrance vs. Everyone Else\n\nOnce again at war in 1805, Napoleon moved his Grande Armée toward the Rhine, encircling an unprepared Austrian army at Ulm and forcing its surrender before marching to occupy Vienna. After two months of difficult but inconclusive maneuvering, Napoleon sprung a savage attack on a Russian army at Austerlitz on December 2. This sent the Russians fleeing and prompted the Austrians to sue for peace. Prussia was sufficiently alarmed at the French threat, yet suffered defeats in October 1806 at Jena and Auerstadt. Within a month of brilliant campaigning, Napoleon swept Prussia’s forces from the field and, for the time being, eliminated it as a power.\n\nIn early 1807, a winter campaign culminated in the battle of Friedland and the death of nearly half of the Russian army. The Tsar, convinced that further conflict would cost Russia even more dearly, conceded by the Treaty of Tilsit to become Napoleon’s ally.\n\nUnable to strike Britain directly, Napoleon tried to close Europe to British trade through the Continental System, an embargo never completely realized. In Spain, Napoleon’s involvement passed from distraction to ulcer as a civil war erupted and the arrival of a large British army cost the French army tens of thousands of casualties in an unprofitable theater of war.\n\nSubsequent campaigns against a revived Austria led to the invasion of Russia in 1812, which ended disastrously. Napoleon reached Moscow only to see the city burn around him without a Russian surrender. During the return march to central Europe, Russian Cossacks and roving infantry decimated French ranks.\n\nA Last Hurrah\n\nAfter this disaster, Napoleon’s star began to plummet. The armies of the Sixth Coalition (Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and others) were victorious at Leipzig, and their forces invaded France in 1814, securing Napoleon’s abdication and restoring the Bourbons.\n\nExiled to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean, Napoleon engineered a return, landing in France in March 1815. He gathered a new army and launched the Hundred Days Campaign that ended in defeat at Waterloo and a second abdication and exile. Napoleon died on the British island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic in 1821.\n\nCourageous, creative, and charismatic, Napoleon inspired utter devotion in his subordinates, and he propelled France to the front rank of nations. His aggressive style of war unleashed the furies of nationalism and patriotism, thereby empowering the central state and forcing his adversaries to adapt or perish.\n\nHoratio Nelson\n\nBritish naval officer and national hero, Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758–1805) won a number of signature victories over Franco-Spanish fleets during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. His greatest achievement was his triumph at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, which sealed British naval superiority and ended Napoleon’s ambitions for threatening Britain from the sea.\n\nOut to Sea at an Early Age\n\nThe son of a clergyman, Viscount Horatio Nelson joined the navy in 1770. He served as a midshipman aboard the HMS Raissonable under the command of his uncle, Captain Maurice Suckling, serving with Suckling aboard the HMS Triumph the next year. After voyages to the West Indies and Arctic between 1771 and 1774, Nelson sailed aboard the HMS Seahorse to the East Indies.\n\nNelson became a lieutenant on HMS Lowestoft in 1777 and soon earned command of HMS Badger, a brig. Two years later, Nelson was promoted to captain of the frigate Hinchinbrook.\n\nFighting the French\n\nAfter a period of illness and convalescence, Nelson received several minor commands and duties. Upon the outbreak of war with France, he was appointed captain of the sixty-four-gun HMS Agamemnon in February 1793, serving in the Mediterranean under Admiral Hood. During this period while serving at Naples, Nelson met Lady Emma Hamilton, wife of the British Ambassador, a woman with whom Nelson would engage in a notorious liaison despite his own marriage from 1787 to Frances Nisbet.\n\nNelson completed operations in the waters near Corsica and around Calvi Bay and was wounded in 1794, losing sight in his right eye. He subsequently fought under Admiral Hotham at the Battle of Genoa in March 1795 and continued to operate along the Italian coast, attempting to interrupt the French army’s operations, but to only modest effect. When Spain entered the war alongside France, Nelson commanded two frigates in late 1796 and early 1797 that evacuated the British garrison from the island of Elba.\n\nNelson was promoted to commodore and distinguished himself by contributing to British Admiral John Jervis’ victory off Cape St. Vincent on February 14, 1797. Ignoring standing orders, Nelson turned out of line and lead boarding parties that captured two Spanish ships and blocked the escape of part of the Spanish fleet. For his achievement, Nelson was made rear admiral and knighted.\n\nHe next blockaded Cadiz in the spring of 1797 and in July attacked Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary islands, an action that cost him his right arm. When recovered he rejoined Jervis off Gibraltar in the spring of 1798 and went near Toulon to scout French naval activities. Nelson’s ship the HMS Vanguard lost its mast during a storm in May. After its repairs were complete, the French were absent. Joined by Commodore Troubridge and ten more ships of the line, Nelson aggressively searched the Mediterranean waters for the French fleet. He found them anchored in shallow water at Aboukir Bay, sheltering there after transporting Napoleon’s army to Egypt. Nelson surprised the French in an audacious attack on August 1, 1798. Although suffering nine hundred casualties, Nelson captured or destroyed most of the French ships, effectively stranding Napoleon’s army and ensuring British mastery of the Mediterranean.\n\nNelson, now Baron Nelson of the Nile, sailed to Naples in September to support operations against the French there, being compelled to evacuate the royal family to Palermo in January 1799; he maintained a blockade until Allied fortunes improved allowing the royals to be returned in June. Nelson was promoted to vice admiral on January 1, 1801, and appointed second in command to Admiral Sir Hyde Parker’s Baltic Fleet.\n\nInvincible at Sea, but Not Immortal\n\nAt the Battle of Copenhagen, Nelson again ignored orders—this time theatrically placing his telescope to his blind eye and claiming he could not see any signal—before plunging into the action and earning another bloody victory. He took command of the Baltic Fleet after Parker’s return to England in May but went home as well in June, suffering from ill health. Nelson spent the next year recuperating, not returning to active duty until the termination of the Peace of Amiens in May 1803. Given command of the Mediterranean Fleet, he instituted a blockade off Toulon in June.\n\nUsing poor weather to shield his actions, Admiral Pierre Charles Villeneuve led out the French fleet and escaped from Toulon in March 1805. Convinced that his adversary had sailed for the West Indies, Nelson sailed there and back but was unable to locate the enemy. Only in late summer did he find the Franco-Spanish ships at Cadiz. When Villeneuve sortied on October 18, Nelson pounced. At the Battle of Trafalgar on October 21, he gained the single greatest naval victory since the defeat of the Spanish Armada more than two centuries prior.\n\nNelson, in command aboard HMS Victory, abandoned the traditional line-ahead tactics to lead a column of twelve ships to break the center of the enemy fleet; concurrently and to the south, Vice Admiral Collingwood struck with another column. In the resulting melee Nelson effectively destroyed the Franco-Spanish fleet as an offensive threat, thereby crushing Napoleon’s plans to threaten Britain from the sea. Thereafter, Bonaparte would have to be content with conquests in central and eastern Europe. However, Nelson was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter while engaging Villeneuve’s flagship and died several hours after the battle.\n\nNelson was a masterful naval leader whose victories in combat secured British naval superiority during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was aggressive, decisive, brave, innovative, and mercurial, and he was adored by his sailors and officers. Nelson trusted and empowered his subordinates, thereby gaining their fierce loyalty and ensuring that they were willing to execute his bold tactical maneuvers. His many successes and expansive ego ensured that he was a notorious figure in life; his heroic death confirmed for Nelson a legacy as one of history’s greatest sea captains.\n\nArthur Wellesley, First Duke of Wellington\n\nIntelligent, talented, and hard-working, Wellington (1769–1852) would prove himself one of the greatest military commanders of any age by leading Anglo, Portuguese, and Spanish armies during successful campaigns in India and Spain, as well as the final campaign in Belgium against Napoleon. Wellington earned the distinction of never losing a battle at which he was present.\n\nFalling into a Career\n\nArthur Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family. The second son of the Earl of Mornington, the young Wellington showed no particular military promise. However, he needed a place to make his fortune, so when he reached the age of seventeen his mother and brother purchased a commission for him.\n\nWellesley served initially as an aide-de-camp and was shortly promoted to lieutenant. He was elected an independent member of Parliament for his family’s seat of Trim and continued to gain rank. By 1790 he was a captain, and in 1793 he was able to purchase a majority and lieutenant colonelcy in the Thirty-Third Regiment.\n\nBetween 1794–1795, Wellesley was with the Thirty-Third in Flanders campaigning against the French, and in 1796, now a colonel, he sailed for India. His brother was appointed governor-general; after being given a command, Wellesley fought in several campaigns and was made governor of Seringapatam and Mysore. In 1803 he beat the Marathas at Assaye, losing 1,500 of his 7,000 men but earning distinction for courage in battle as two of his horses were killed under him. Wellington also won an important battle at Argaum and seized the fortress of Gawlighur.\n\nReturning home in 1805, Wellington was made a Knight of the Bath. He led a brigade on a brief Anglo-Russian expedition to the Elbe in northern Germany, and then took a command to Denmark in 1807, earning promotion to lieutenant general. Meanwhile he was elected as a Tory member of Parliament and was appointed chief Secretary of Ireland, a position he held for two years.\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula\n\nIn the spring of 1808, Wellington led a small force to Portugal. He defeated the French at the Battle of Vimeiro but his superior, Sir Harry Burrard, granted the French army safe passage. Wellington was recalled to face a Board of Enquiry but was cleared. He returned to Portugal in 1809 and quickly secured Porto, within a month driving French troops from Portuguese soil; his reward was a peerage for himself. Alongside his Spanish allies, he pursued the retreating enemy into Spain. The War on the Peninsula had become important to Britain, as it was recognized as the best place to bleed France of men, money, and material.\n\nWith Austria making peace, Napoleon moved to quiet his southern flank by sending reinforcements to Spain, so Wellington withdrew into Portugal. In September 1810, Wellington’s forces blunted the French Marshal Masséna’s attack at Busaco, but the French continued to press. Wellington moved into his extensive fortifications, the Lines of Torres Vedras, finally halting the French advance. Starved of resources and unable to dislodge Wellington’s army, Masséna withdrew from Portugal in March 1811.\n\nIn early 1812, Wellington assaulted Ciudad Rodrigo by storm. He then proceeded to attack Badajoz in April with heavy loss of life, and in July he executed a brilliant campaign to defeat Masséna’s successor, Marmont, at Salamanca. For leading British armies to so many victories at a time when triumphs over Napoleon’s marshals were yet rare, he was given an earldom by the grateful monarchy.\n\nThe spring of 1813 found Wellington again on the move, advancing back into Spain to confront Napoleon’s brother, Joseph. At the Battle of Vitoria, Wellington led a force numbering about eighty thousand. He held the French center in place while delivering a devastating flank assault that sent the French reeling. The result was another British victory as Joseph barely escaped, losing his personal baggage and more than 150 cannons. For this achievement, Wellington earned a field marshal’s baton.\n\nWellington next stormed San Sebastian and then entered France in October. He defeated the French army under Marshal Soult at the Battle of Toulouse. Word of Napoleon’s abdication soon brought an end to fighting. Made a duke, Wellington returned home to extravagant praise.\n\nCurtain Call at Waterloo\n\nIn March 1815, Wellington learned of Napoleon’s escape from exile on the island of Elba. Wellington was appointed commander in chief of British and Dutch-Belgian forces in the Low Countries, arriving in April to begin preparations for the Hundred Days Campaign. He was attending a ball in Brussels when he heard of Napoleon’s offensive and rushed his army to meet the French threat.\n\nWellington reached Quatre Bras on the morning of June 16 and then rode eastward to confer with the Prussian General Blücher near Ligny. Although Wellington repulsed Napoleon’s forces under Ney, Blücher was beaten. Rather than fall back, however, Blücher moved his army to a junction with Wellington, who had established a position near Waterloo. The long, bloody contest on June 18 was undecided until late in the afternoon. Wellington repulsed the final French assault as the Prussians struck the French right flank, leading to an Allied victory.\n\nWellington returned home in 1818 to become Master General of the Ordnance with a seat in Lord Liverpool’s cabinet. He was appointed commander in chief in 1827 but resigned. As a rising Tory leader, he became prime minister in 1828. His chief accomplishment was the Catholic Relief Act of 1829. His government fell in 1830, terminating his two uncomfortable years in office. When the Tories again assumed power in 1834, Wellington served temporarily as the prime minister once more and then as Foreign Secretary. He was reappointed commander in chief in 1842, and died a decade later.\n\nThroughout his brilliant career, Wellington demonstrated a superior grasp of tactics and an outstanding ability to maneuver armies in the face of adversity. He was a diligent and attentive administrator who laid out detailed orders for his subordinates, tolerating very little divergence from his direct command. Wellington’s campaigns in India and in Portugal and Spain demonstrated a keen eye for the importance of logistics and a willingness to take risks but never to gamble with the fate of his men. Always out front, his immediate presence on the battlefield gave his troops tremendous confidence in his judgment. By triumphing over Napoleon at Waterloo in one of the most famous battles in military history, he defeated the greatest military leader of the age and signaled his own and his nation’s preeminence for the nineteenth century.\n\nMikhail Kutuzov\n\nMarshal Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745–1813) was a Russian military leader and governor who served gallantly during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), but he earned notoriety for successfully opposing Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia in 1812.\n\nCareer Before Napoleon\n\nThe son of a general in the Russian army, the young Kutuzov followed in his father’s footsteps and attended an engineering and artillery school in 1757, earning a commission as an artillery officer in 1761. He fought in Poland from 1764 to 1769, then transferred to the Crimea in 1770. In combat against the Turks, Kutuzov lost an eye.\n\nDespite this physical loss, rapid promotions followed. As a general, Kutuzov served under Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov, and at the capture of Izmail in 1790, he commanded one of the assaults. A modest tactical innovator, Kutuzov gradually came to favor column formations based upon study of the French Revolutionary armies.\n\nLeaving active field service, Kutuzov subsequently held a variety of administrative posts, including ambassador to Constantinople, governor of Finland, ambassador to Berlin, governor of Lithuania, and military governor of St Petersburg.\n\nOpposing Napoleon\n\nIn 1802, Kutuzov retired. However, in 1805, he was recalled to active duty as a part of Russia’s military preparations to wage war against France as a member of the Third Coalition. He was sent to confront Napoleon in central Europe, but the Austrians surrendered at Ulm before his army could effect a junction with them.\n\nThe Russian army still adhered to outdated methods of organization, training, and doctrine. While the individual Russian soldier was tenacious, junior officers had difficulty executing battlefield maneuvers, decision-making by commanders was tedious, and other than the artillery arm, weapons and equipment were lacking in terms of both quality and quantity. It was with these kinds of limitations that Kutuzov encountered Napoleon and the French Army at its peak of fighting performance in December 1805 at Austerlitz. The result was a tremendous French victory that virtually destroyed the Third Coalition. Tsar Alexander I, who held Kutuzov responsible for the defeat, banished him to a series of assignments far from the primary theaters of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAlthough not in favor, the general was still capable. Kutuzov was the military governor of Kiev in 1806, and then of Vilnius in 1809. He led the Army of Moldavia against the Turks in 1811, scoring a significant triumph at Ruschuk that led to the Treaty of Bucharest on May 28, 1812, whereby Russia gained Bessarabia. When Napoleon invaded Russia, Tsar Alexander again turned to Kutuzov, appointing him as commander in chief.\n\nA Hard Winter for the French\n\nJoining the army, Kutuzov found a military force that was reeling from defeat. Reluctant to confront Napoleon in a major battle, public and political pressure convinced Kutuzov that he must stand and fight to defend Moscow. The result was the Battle of Borodino on September 7. Commanding 120,000 Russian troops, Kutuzov chose ground about seventy-five miles west of Moscow to contest the advance of Napoleon’s 130,000 men. The battle, which led to about one-third on each side killed and wounded, was indecisive, but Kutuzov halted Napoleon’s momentum and struck a grievous wound to the morale of the French army. Furthermore, along with the barren occupation of Moscow, the battle robbed Napoleon of the strategic initiative. Thereafter, Kutuzov turned to guerrilla-style, hit-and-run operations to attrit (destroy) the French ranks.\n\nPromoted to field marshal for expelling the French invader, Kutuzov attacked Napoleon’s depleted army again at Krasnoye and the Berezina River, and finally through Poland and into Prussia in January 1813. Suffering from exhaustion, he was replaced by General Peter Wittgenstein. Kutuzov died at Bunzlau in Silesia on April 28.\n\nKutuzov was a competent general and military administrator who earned the respect of his soldiers. His career, while successful, was typical of many Russian commanders until he grappled with Napoleon. Thereafter, the memory of the defeat at Austerlitz was replaced by the achievement of the attritional warfare and partisan tactics he promoted to destroy the French army in the winter snows as it retreated from Moscow.\n\nMajor Battles\n\nValmy, September 20, 1792\n\nAt Valmy, French troops defeated a Prussian-Austrian army that was threatening to advance on Paris and expel the Revolutionary government. The leader of the French forces, François Christophe Kellermann, named Duke of Valmy and French Marshal of the Empire, earned a lifelong reputation as a hero of France for his battlefield victory there.\n\nNew Republic, Green Troops\n\nPrior to Valmy, the performance of French troops in battle had been uneven. Insufficiently trained and not yet organized or equipped in modern methods of warfare, they often refused to stand and fight. Such incompetence imperiled the Revolution as it emboldened the monarchical powers of Europe. For the sake of the Revolution, France needed to demonstrate military capability to survive amongst the hostile powers of Europe who were eager to extinguish the revolutionary fervor brewing in Paris.\n\nIn the spring of 1792, Austria and Prussia became allies, and soon war with France returned. The Duke of Brunswick commanded an Allied invasion force during the late summer. He expected to successfully penetrate the French frontier and move on Paris, but the response of the French high command blunted his advance. French General Charles-François Dumouriez marched elements of his Army of the North to bottle Brunswick in the Argonne Forest. This gave Kellermann sufficient time to move his Army of the Centre to Valmy. By the time Brunswick emerged with his 30,000 men, Kellermann blocked his path with a force numbering more than 35,000.\n\nThe battle involved relatively little tactical maneuvering. Kellermann kept the main body of his infantry in place while unleashing an artillery barrage that soon bested the Allied guns. Brunswick sent forward Prussian infantry, but the effort was half-hearted, and the force turned back in the face of the French artillery. Lacking the will to order a major assault, and likewise unwilling to risk his army, Kellermann also declined to undertake the offense. Hence, the battle ended in a face-off. Ultimately, Brunswick withdrew, yielding the field and the strategic momentum of the campaign to the French. The Allies were unable to make any further sustained threat to the heart of France for the duration of the campaign season.\n\nThe Infant Republic Lives\n\nWithin France, the Battle at Valmy was viewed as the moment when French arms were proved superior and the Revolution was assured. As a reward for his triumph at Valmy, Kellermann was given command of the Army of the Alps, but he never achieved another major battlefield win. His career thereafter was unremarkable, although he demonstrated administrative skills as one of Napoleon’s generals and served France until his death in 1820. Brunswick went on to fight against the French in Germany in 1793, notably at the Siege of Mainz. In 1806, he again commanded a Prussian army, but suffered defeat and was mortally wounded in battle by French troops of Napoleon’s Marshal Davout at the battle of Auerstadt.\n\nJemappes, November 6, 1792\n\nFought in Hainaut, Belgium (near Mons), the Battle of Jemappes was a French victory over a smaller Austrian army. The battle served to protect the French Republic and provided notice to France’s enemies that French military ability was growing more confident and capable.\n\nThe Revolution As Plague\n\nThe traditional monarchies of Europe were appalled by the events that unfolded within France after 1789. Rightly seeing a threat to their own legitimacy, they marshaled their military forces to quell the revolutionary ideology. In the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), which pitted Austria, Prussia, and several other smaller states against France, the Allies expected to invade France and easily defeat the amateur Republican armies.\n\nWhen active hostilities began in April 1792, France hastily deployed its armies to its borders. Unfortunately, the overall quality of French troops was substandard. Poorly equipped, insufficiently trained, and lacking sufficient artillery, French formations would have to rely upon their enthusiasm to make up for their inadequate organization.\n\nIn the north, two armies consisting of about fifty thousand men each under Generals Rochambeau and Lafayette protected the northern coast and the approaches to the Ardennes Forest. A more compact army under General Luckner guarded the Rhine frontier, and yet another force under General Montesquieu watched the country’s southern border.\n\nMajor combat ensued when Prussia and Austria launched an invasion of France that aimed directly for Paris in the summer of 1792. Initially, the Allied force led by the Duke of Brunswick marched against little opposition into France, casually seizing the fortresses at Longwy and Verdun. Shifting forces to meet this threat, the French Army of the Centre under General François Kellermann was joined by elements from the Army of the North under General Charles Dumouriez. On September 20, in an evenly matched contest, the French won a major victory at Valmy, prompting Brunswick to retire and saving Paris and the Revolution.\n\nFortune Favors the Bold\n\nThe immediate threat to France was not yet removed, however. Moving north, Dumouriez’s advance prompted the Austrians to lift their Siege of Lille, as the campaign season was drawing to a close. The Austrians entered their winter camps at Jemappes, on the Belgian side of the frontier.\n\nWith forty thousand men and one hundred guns, Dumouriez launched a surprise offensive that caught the smaller Austrian force of thirteen thousand men by surprise. The French troops charged the Austrian lines and won a victory. French losses were about two thousand killed and wounded, while Austrian casualties numbered approximately 1,500. French troops followed the battle by seizing Brussels ten days later and laying Siege to Antwerp.\n\nThe battle, although not large in terms of forces engaged, was important because—as had occurred at Valmy—the French Republic was preserved. After Jemappes, French armies would demonstrate a sustained capacity to take the offensive to the nation’s enemies.\n\nToulon, September–December, 1793\n\nDuring the Seige of Toulon, royalist forces within the city, heavily augmented by foreign troops, were eventually defeated by troops supporting the Revolution. This victory kept the French fleet at Toulon in the hands of the Republic, and it also made a name for a young artillery captain named Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nRevolution in Chaos\n\nIn 1793, four years after the Estates General convened and the Paris mob stormed the Bastille, signaling a comprehensive political upheaval in France, the Revolution faced dire threats, both internally and from abroad. After the arrest of radical Girondist deputies and uprisings in Paris in late May, revolts spread through major French cities, including Lyon, Avignon, Nimes, and Marseille.\n\nBy September, the time known as the Terror would proceed; over the next ten months, thousands would meet their end at the guillotine, with radicals justifying all violence as a necessity to restore order and secure the Revolution. As might be expected, the Terror contributed to the ongoing political instability, economic dislocation, and administrative ineffectiveness of both local and national governance. The civil distractions accompanying the Terror also imperiled the French armed forces at a time when external threats to France were gathering momentum.\n\nFrom the southwest, Spain was capable of launching an offensive across the Pyrenees. Eastward, Italian and Austrian troops were making offensive preparations. To the north, an Anglo-Hanoverian expedition under the Duke of York was on the march in Flanders, where it would lay siege at Dunkirk and link forces with Habsburg troops. In addition, a hostile Allied army of more than 120,000 men was assembling along the Rhine frontier after capturing Mainz.\n\nTo meet these dangers, the Revolutionary government of the Convention in Paris oversaw an army theoretically of about 270,000 troops, but the number of men reporting to duty was much lower. Morale was low, pay was intermittent, and training was poor. Overall, the effectiveness of army formations was widely inconsistent.\n\nFrance Crowns a King\n\nWithin the important port city of Toulon, the Revolutionaries lost their foothold to royalist factions who, seeking protection, summoned assistance from an Anglo-Spanish fleet nearby. British Admiral Samuel Hood committed more than ten thousand British, Spanish, and Allied men to the royalist cause. On October 1, under the protection of the British navy and its garrison, the adolescent Louis XVII was proclaimed as the new King of France.\n\nThe French fleet, still anchored at Toulon was also at grave risk of being destroyed or at least lost to the cause of Revolution. Republican forces recognized this direct challenge to their legitimacy and quickly mobilized in response.\n\nTo assault the city, the six thousand men of the Alpine Maritime Army, having recaptured Avignon and Marseille and then Ollioules on September 8, arrived at Toulon under the command of General Lapoype to link up with the troops sent by the Convention and led by General Jean François Carteaux. They were reinforced by Admiral de Saint Julien and some three thousand sailors from the invested—and forcibly anchored—French fleet in harbor. Their first objective was to seize the forts guarding the eastern approaches to the city.\n\nA young captain named Napoleon Bonaparte commanded the Convention’s French artillery under the Chief of Artillery, General Elzéar-Auguste Cousin de Dommartin. A thorough reconnaissance revealed to this impetuous cannoneer that the most rapid means of distressing Toulon’s defenders was to cut their lines of supply with the ships in port. Bonaparte thus devised a plan to seize the forts of l’Eguillette and Balaguier, which would bisect passage between the port’s harbors.\n\nThe Royalists Reinforce\n\nNapoleon could not convince his superiors of his plan’s utility, and hence when a modest French force made the attack on September 22, it was repulsed without achieving its objective. Now recognizing the threat in this sector, the Allies constructed Fort Mulgrave, a bastion augmented by supporting works named Saint-Philippe, Saint-Côme, and Saint-Charles. Given its extraordinary strength, this complex was named “Little Gibraltar.”\n\nA series of back-and-forth actions over the coming weeks characterized the battle. Not pleased with the limited reach of his cannons, Napoleon directed that his battery be moved from the height of Saint-Laurent to the shore of Brégallion. This position placed increasing pressure on the British, but Hood’s men were unable to silence it.\n\nIn early October, after another French sortie failed, Napoleon was ordered to fire against the substantial Fort Malbousquet. Concentrating all available guns into a grand battery of several hundred cannon and newly promoted to Chief of Battalion, Napoleon began operations. After further assaults still failed to carry the British lines, the Republican commander in chief, General Jean François Carteaux, was replaced on November 11.\n\nAnother Napoleon Plan\n\nBonaparte now believed that success could be achieved by encircling the British and placing ever-increasing fire upon the defenders. He presented this scheme to his new commander, General Jacques François Dugommier, who received the plans favorably. Fresh batteries were emplaced around the city. The guns were sighted both to oppose the Allied works as well as to disrupt the ability of the Allies to bring ships near the shore to bombard French positions.\n\nNow pressured day and night by Napoleon’s guns, the Allies assaulted the French battery named the “Convention.” In response, Dugommier and Napoleon led a counterattack that captured the British General, O’Hara. With the tide turning in favor of the besiegers, Napoleon—who was promoted again, this time to colonel—participated in a major nighttime assault against the works of Little Gibraltar on December 16.\n\nNapoleon suffered a bayonet wound in the thigh during the attack, but the assault was successful. In the morning, French artillery was advanced to directly strike l’Eguillette and Balaguier, which the British evacuated without confrontation on the same day. Other attacks by the Convention’s troops also made progress so that the Allies saw little recourse but to yield the city and evacuate aboard ship.\n\nWhen the city fell to revolutionary forces on December 19, the consequences for the remaining defenders were severe. Almost two thousand prisoners were shot or were stabbed by bayonet, and depredations against property were widespread.\n\nNapoleon was treated for his injuries and promoted to brigadier general on December 22. His conduct during the siege and battle of Toulon marked his entrance upon the national scene in France. He would shortly go on to command artillery and then French forces in Italy to even greater acclaim, in the process making himself indispensable to the leaders of the revolutionary government in Paris.\n\nFleurus, June 26, 1794\n\nA contest of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Battle of Fleurus pitted French troops led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan against an Austrian army commanded by General Saxe-Coburg. A decisive French victory, the battle expelled the Allies from the Low Countries and greatly relieved the external military pressure on the Revolutionary government in Paris.\n\nThe Revolution Rearms\n\nBy 1794, the perilous military situation facing France during the previous year had been alleviated through battlefield successes, most notably at Toulon. Domestically, government reforms were beginning to take positive effect; universal conscription, the levée en masse, had brought more than 1,500,000 men into the armies of France. This massive influx of troops meant that major offensives could be contemplated to throw back the Allied cordon that had previously threatened the nation from all directions. Keeping large army formations away from Paris, while at the same time forcing communities located far from the capital—and ideally beyond France—to maintain the soldiery, was also advantageous.\n\nThe nation now could boast of more than a dozen armies in the field totaling almost 800,000 men. In the northeast, the armies of the Ardennes and the North were readying themselves with 300,000; along the Rhine frontier were another 200,000; 120,000 troops defended at the Pyrenees and the Italian border; and the Army of the Interior counted a final 80,000.\n\nWhile the ranks of French formations were increasing, the Allies were finding it increasingly difficult to keep their units manned. The strength of Allied forces was only slightly more than half the French total. As a further distraction, diplomatic jostling among the Allies was prompting the monarchies to reconsider their commitment to war with France. One such concern was the appearance of republican ideology throughout their realms, a scourge attributable to France, but one not easily remedied.\n\nOnward and Outward\n\nSetbacks over the course of the year compounded the precarious Allied military position. The Duke of Brunswick, still stinging from defeat at Valmy more than a year prior, resigned as commander on the Rhine in January. Although not conducting any major assaults, French troops took advantage of the situation to seize territory on the west bank of the river. The commander of the Army of the North, General Jean-Charles Pichegru, led French troops to victories at Courtrai on May 11 and at Tourcoing on the 18th. Seeking to exploit the withdrawal of the combined Austrian, Hanoverian, and British force under Saxe-Coburg, a French army struck near Tournai on May 23, but the battle was inconclusive.\n\nIn June, the French General Jourdan marched at the head of a new combined force of more than 75,000 men known as the Army of the Sambre and Meuse; their objective was the city of Charleroi, located some six miles southwest of Fleurus. On June 12, the French force invested the town, but the siege was shortlived. On June 16, an Austrian-Dutch force counterattacked with more than forty thousand troops, inflicting several thousand casualties and prompting Jourdan to fall back. Two days later Jourdan counterattacked, this time successfully compelling the city’s surrender on June 26.\n\nThe same day, Saxe-Coburg was present near Charleroi with fifty thousand Austrian and Dutch troops, but they could not attack in time to save the city. The Austrians struck the French flanks, gaining ground on each. However, they were unable to budge the French center, thus the assault stalled. Although Saxe-Coburg had inflicted greater casualties than his army had suffered, he lost his confidence and ordered a general retirement. The following day the Allies retired beyond the Meuse.\n\nThe French triumph prompted the Allies’ withdrawal from Belgium, which French forces exploited by marching into the Netherlands, taking Brussels on July 10 and entering Antwerp on the July 27. The Austrians were not able to reassert control over the Low Countries, which is why the Battle of Fleurus marks a watershed victory for the French Revolution.\n\nArcole\n\nAt the Battle of Arcole, Napoleon demonstrated his penchant for aggressive and energetic tactical maneuver. The clash showcased the emerging French way of warfare that empowered Napoleon’s key generals to make decisions in support of their commander’s intent, and it also highlighted the growing vigor, training, and capability of the individual French soldier.\n\nBonaparte Heads to Italy\n\nWhen the campaign of 1796 opened, the critical front was neither in the Low Countries nor along the Rhine, but to the south in Italy, where Habsburg defenses remained powerful and important to the Austrian Empire. The Directory government in Paris appointed Napoleon, at the young age of 26, as commander of the French Army of Italy. His instructions were to secure French interests in that region.\n\nThe army he was sent to command, like most French armies of the period, was not yet a capable fighting force. It numbered about 45,000 men, but they were undisciplined and lacking sufficient equipment. Napoleon, however, quickly set about reforming the army’s organization and overseeing every aspect of preparation for the approaching operations.\n\nWithin weeks, he had instilled in his troops a renewed sense of purpose and confidence. By the late spring, Napoleon had entered Milan and inflicted sharp defeats on two separate Austrian forces, in the process ejecting the Austrians from almost all of Lombardy. The exception was the fortress city of Mantua with its garrison of thirteen thousand defenders.\n\nOn June 4, Napoleon laid siege to Mantua while the Habsburgs rushed additional troops to the area. Three major enemy columns began to diverge on Napoleon’s position. General Peter Quasdanovich led 18,000 troops headed for the French support positions around Brescia; meanwhile, General Dagobert Wurmser marched through the valley of the Adige with 24,000 men with the purpose of relieving the French siege at Mantua; and finally, another 5,000 men were on the move through the Brenta Valley. Napoleon knew he must act decisively to meet these threats before they could consolidate against him.\n\nAttack in Detail\n\nNapoleon lifted the siege at Mantua and gathered all available French troops, numbering about 47,000 men. In August, he struck the separate columns in turn, inflicting losses on each in sharply fought engagements. With the Austrian advance blunted, he then resumed his investment at Mantua, fighting again when Wurmser’s relief column attacked. While Napoleon captured an entire Austrian division before Wurmser’s force made it inside the Austrian defensive lines, the garrison inside the city was now increased to 28,000.\n\nIn the autumn, the Austrians again sought to relieve the city. This time General Paul Davidovich advanced down the valley of the Adige with 16,000 men, while General Baron Joszef Alvintzi and his 27,000 troops moved to meet Davidovich at Verona.\n\nOnce more seeing the Habsburg threat marshaling, Napoleon detached forces to watch Davidovich and sent 18,000 men to strike Alvintzi’s advance guard at Caldiero on November 12. Although Davidovich’s force was able to inflict damage against Napoleon’s covering formations, the Austrians did not capitalize on their opportunity.\n\nWhile Alvintzi—who was stunned by the violence of the French assault against his army—paused to ponder Napoleon’s next move, Napoleon continued to advance. The French commander hit the Austrians again only three days later. Bypassing Alvintzi’s main body by marching to the south, Napoleon crossed the Adige, turned northward, and attacked at Arcole on November 15.\n\nThe Engagement at Arcole\n\nNapoleon was personally in the midst of the fighting, inserting himself into the assaults that attempted, but failed, to carry the bridge over the Alpone. Although frustrated by heavy losses and the inability to cross the bridge, the French troops continued to press their offensive.\n\nOn the third day of combat, Napoleon’s subordinates found solutions that ultimately won the battle. French General Pierre Augereau crossed the Alpone farther south on a trestle bridge, while the attacks led by General André Masséna at Arcole finally made headway against weakening Austrian opposition. When a detachment of French cavalry forayed behind the Austrian main line, the Austrians—fearing encirclement—fled the battlefield, leaving the French in possession. Napoleon’s forces had earned another hard-fought victory.\n\nNapoleon was unable to prevent Alvintzi from extracting his army, but he had inflicted about six thousand casualties upon the Austrians and again denied the relief of Mantua. French losses were slightly less, and Napoleon had once more demonstrated the flexible command and control abilities of his army, which enabled the French forces, even when outnumbered, to fight effectively against superior forces.\n\nIn the wake of the fight at Arcole, Napoleon maintained his record of success. While the year’s campaigns stretched French resources, his battlefield victories imperiled the Habsburg position in Italy. In January 1797, Napoleon won again at the Battle of Rivoli, and in February, Mantua finally surrendered. Shortly thereafter, the Austrians sought a peace settlement. Napoleon’s status as a conquering hero was further enhanced, and his political power reached new heights in Paris.\n\nCape St. Vincent, February 14, 1797\n\nThe maritime Battle of Cape St. Vincent was one of the great naval actions of the French Revolutionary period. While France earned important victories on land in 1796 at the battles of Arcole and Rivoli in Italy under Napoleon’s direct leadership, French ambitions for an invasion of Britain suffered a setback when Admiral John Jervis inflicted severe damage on a Spanish fleet under José de Córdoba that he intercepted off the Portuguese coast. The British victory demonstrated the growing capabilities of the Royal Navy and brought Admiral Horatio Nelson, the most famous British seaman of the Napoleonic Wars, to prominence.\n\nFrance and Spain Combine Forces\n\nWhen Spain declared war on Britain and Portugal in October 1796, British interests in the Mediterranean were directly threatened. The Royal Navy, with only a modest fleet of slightly more than a dozen ships of the line, supervised evacuations of British garrisons in Corsica and Elba and prepared for the inevitable action against the much larger Franco-Spanish fleet, which boasted nearly forty ships.\n\nEarly in 1797, a Spanish fleet of about thirty ships of the line sailed to link up with a French convoy at Brest. Cordóba led his vessels from Cartagena on February 1 for what should have been a simple voyage. When strong winds pushed his fleet farther into the Atlantic than he intended, he was forced to tack back eastward.\n\nJervis, meanwhile, was attempting to intercept the Spanish ships before they reached the safety of the French harbor. He was an experienced, stern, and capable seaman who had served alongside Captain James Cook and General Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec in 1759 before service in the War of American Independence. Jervis only had ten ships with him until February 6, when these were augmented by five ships from the British Channel Fleet under Rear Admiral William Parker.\n\nOn February 11, the British frigate Minerve, under the command of one of the Royal Navy’s most audacious young leaders, Commodore Horatio Nelson, spotted the Spanish fleet. Because of fog, however, he was unable to ascertain his enemy’s size and composition. By February 14, Jervis had located the Spanish and realized that his fifteen ships of the line (with 1,232 guns) faced twenty-seven enemy counterparts (carrying 2,308 cannon). Nonetheless, Jervis was determined to attack and prevent his enemies from combining their fleets. He knew that his sailors were more skilled and his gunners had greater professional training than the large number of landsmen and soldiers constituting the Spanish crews.\n\nSailing Between the Lines\n\nThe Spanish fleet was formed into two groups, and Jervis decided to exploit this disposition by sailing between the two enemy divisions, allowing his ships to fire in both directions and minimizing the damage that the Spanish could inflict in return. As Jervis closed to attack, the Spanish began maneuvering to close their formation.\n\nNelson observed the Spanish response, and fearing that they would successfully unite their divisions before the British could strike, he ordered the seventy-four-gun Captain (which he was now on) to break from the British line and block the advance of the Spanish van. This was a completely unconventional and unusual action for a British sea captain; if it had not succeeded, Nelson would have been severely punished.\n\nObserving this development, Jervis ordered the last ship in line, the Excellent, to close across the Spanish line as well. By then, the Captain was taking fire from as many as six Spanish ships, of which three were 112-gun three-deckers and a fourth was Cordóba’s 130-gun flagship, the Santísima Trinidad.\n\nWith the Captain’s rigging in tatters and the ship unable to maneuver effectively, Nelson ordered his crew to nudge it alongside the Spanish eighty-gun San Nicolás and send boarding parties to capture the enemy vessel. Meanwhile, the Excellent had pounded the Spanish 112-gun San José so that it became entangled with San Nicolás, allowing British boarding parties to capture both ships.\n\nAfter the Battle\n\nThe British ultimately seized four Spanish ships and drove off the enemy fleet at a casualty cost of seventy-three killed and about four hundred wounded. The Spanish losses were approximately one thousand men killed or wounded. While the successful British tactics at Cape St. Vincent had been concentrated against only a portion of the Spanish fleet (mainly the vessels of Córdoba’s group), the general superiority of British gunnery and seamanship was evident.\n\nJervis was elevated to the peerage as Earl St. Vincent. Nelson was knighted as a member of the Order of the Bath, and his promotion to Rear-Admiral was officially published. After the battle, Jervis imposed a blockade of the Spanish fleet at Cádiz.\n\nDespite the British triumph, the Royal Navy faced internal challenges requiring Jervis’ attention. Between April and June, significant mutinies broke out aboard the fleets at Spithead and the Nore, indicating substantial dissatisfaction with the poor food, inadequate pay, and harsh discipline of ship captains. Jervis would address these concerns, and the Royal Navy would go on to win most of the battles at sea until Napoleon’s final abdication.\n\nThe Egyptian Campaign, 1798–1801\n\nThe French expedition to Egypt was a grandiose scheme endorsed by Napoleon that would reveal the glories of Islamic culture to Europeans on a broad scale and result in long-lasting consequences for both the residents of the Middle East as well as the peoples of Europe. In the short term, although the French army in Egypt ultimately capitulated, Napoleon’s reputation as a military hero of France was burnished.\n\nPaying the Pharaohs a Visit\n\nUpon the end of his Italian campaign, Napoleon recognized that a direct invasion of England was not feasible, and a broader European war was in France’s immediate interest. However, the occupation of Egypt offered a number of benefits to France: trade and diplomatic influence would be enhanced; the opening of a trade route through the Red Sea could directly challenge Britain’s longer trade route around the Cape of Good Hope; and, if successful, a French army in the Levant could launch a subsequent attack against British India. At the same time, Napoleon intended to undertake an extensive cultural survey of the lands his troops conquered.\n\nIn May 1798, Napoleon, accompanied by forty thousand troops and a large contingent of government administrators, scientists, and academics, set sail aboard the ships of the Toulon fleet. British Admiral Horatio Nelson eagerly pursued, but initially the French armada escaped him. Seizing Malta en route, Napoleon’s army reached Egypt safely and dropped anchor in Aboukir Bay on July 1, quickly moving ashore to occupy Alexandria.\n\nHowever, Napoleon’s position was not secure until he ended the threat posed by the Mamelukes, the Islamic troops loyal to the Islamic caliph of the Ottoman Empire. When on July 21 French forces defeated a Mameluke army at the Battle of the Pyramids, he thus ensured his control of lower Egypt.\n\nOn August 1, Napoleon’s position became much more tenuous as Nelson, who located the French fleet still sheltering in shallow waters in Aboukir Bay, launched a daring attack that effectively destroyed the French armada. Napoleon’s line of communications, as well as any hope for reinforcement, was now severed.\n\nStranded\n\nIn September, the Ottomans, as nominal rulers of Egypt, declared war on France. Seeking to protect his gains in Egypt and forestall a Turkish offensive from Syria, Napoleon invaded Palestine in February 1799. His Siege of Acre failed when he encountered more substantial fortifications than he had expected, and the tenacity of the defenders finally overwhelmed the French attackers’ ability to sustain the operation. An outbreak of bubonic plague and ongoing British naval pressure further diminished Napoleon’s chances for success. Although the French repulsed a Turkish landing in Aboukir Bay, Napoleon could see that he was isolated in Egypt, and his army was overextended and increasingly vulnerable.\n\nWhen the Directory requested Napoleon’s return to France, he eagerly accepted for a number of reasons. A new coalition was coalescing to oppose France even as a Russo-Austrian army was pressing French forces in northern Italy; fighting was breaking out from Germany to the Netherlands; and Britain’s blockade had tightened. Thus, Napoleon correctly calculated that there was nothing further to gain from his continued presence in the Middle East. Although many of his subordinates felt betrayed, Napoleon slipped away in a frigate and sailed for France in August 1799.\n\nPost-Bonaparte Blues\n\nCommanding the French army now was General Jean Baptiste Kléber. In January 1800, an initial agreement (the Convention of El Arish) was reached with British Rear Admiral Sir Sidney Smith by which the French army would be repatriated to France, but differences ensued and the Convention was set aside. Kléber’s assassination in June meant that command passed to Jacques François Menou. A convert to Islam, Menou married an Egyptian and changed his name to Abdullah. Convinced that Egypt should be a colony of France, he drafted legislation to encourage Egyptian commerce and agriculture. Nonetheless, the Egyptian populace opposed him and continued to resist French rule.\n\nThe British government insisted that France must not be allowed to govern Egypt, and with the French army isolated and Napoleon gone, only the complete destruction of the French army would suffice. In March 1801, Sir Ralph Abercromby conducted an assault landing in Aboukir Bay with 14,000 men and defeated Menou at the Battle for Alexandria. In conjunction with the Turks, the British demanded and obtained the surrender of the demoralized French garrison in Cairo. British troops then laid siege to Menou in Alexandria. The French capitulated in September.\n\nThe Egyptian campaign, while a military defeat for France in the short term, served to lift Napoleon’s stature at home. He returned to France as a conquering hero and went forward to further consolidate his influence and power. The campaign also elevated Admiral Nelson to prominence and served to restore British confidence. In a broader sense, the European penetration of the Islamic homelands fostered a century-long competition among European powers for control of Middle Eastern territories. Islam was also exposed to the pressures of Western ideas and technologies, a dynamic still affecting international relations today.\n\nMarengo, June 14, 1800\n\nThe Battle of Marengo, fought between French forces under overall command of Napoleon Bonaparte and an Austrian army led by General Michael von Melas, was a closely contested French victory that blunted an Austrian offensive in northern Italy and served to secure Napoleon’s stature as a military leader of extraordinary genius. The campaign earned notoriety from Napoleon’s epic march across the Alps to fall on the Austrian army’s rear echelons.\n\nWhile the Cat’s Away …\n\nWhile Bonaparte was occupied in Egypt in 1798, the monarchies of Europe were engaged in diplomatic efforts to raise a new coalition to oppose France. An alliance consisting of Britain, Russia, Austria, Naples, Portugal, and a host of lesser German states sought to take advantage of France’s internal turmoil to finally contain the French Revolution. However, France’s ruling Directory also had plans for military offensives to secure the state.\n\nUpon Napoleon’s return to France, a publicity campaign concealed the military failures of his Egyptian campaign, and he received a hero’s reception. After leading a coup, the French Republic was dissolved and Napoleon emerged as First Consul. To solidify his rule and divert attention from domestic contention, Napoleon sought a military victory. The Second Coalition had effectively driven French forces back to the natural boundaries of the state along the Rhine and Alps. Yet units of the French army still held key positions in Switzerland, and it was south and east towards Italy that Napoleon chose to lead a new offensive.\n\nNapoleon directed General (later to be named Marshal) Masséna to take remnants of the French Army of Italy along the Riviera coastline to fix an Austrian army commanded by Michael von Melas near Genoa. Meanwhile, the French Army of the Rhine would act as a diversion while Napoleon struck south with the fifty-thousand-man Army of the Reserve across the Alps into northern Italy. When Masséna became invested in Genoa in early May, Napoleon knew that he would have to move aggressively.\n\nLike Hannibal, but No Elephants This Time\n\nAfter calling up all available troops and supplies, Napoleon pushed his army across the Great St. Bernhard Pass and over the Alps, dragging horses, men, and guns with heroic effort. He expected Melas to continue to focus on the French forces trapped in Genoa, thereby giving him the chance to pounce behind the Austrian army and roll it up from the rear. For days, Melas was indeed confused as to which advancing French column constituted the primary threat to his position.\n\nEmerging from the Alpine passes, Napoleon consolidated at the head of the Po Valley and then turned east, entering Milan on June 2 and seizing the Austrian supply base there. Next, he moved south across the Po.\n\nWhen Masséna finally yielded at Genoa, an Austrian force turned to meet Napoleon but was defeated by General Lannes on June 9. Napoleon still believed that Melas was trying to avoid a contest, but in fact the Austrian general had decided to fight his way through the gathering French concentration. On June 14, Napoleon sent one division north of the Po River and another division east to the Scrivia River in search of the Austrians. Taking advantage of the French dispositions, the Austrians attacked.\n\nDown But Not Out\n\nNapoleon suddenly found himself outnumbered and with little recourse to rectify the situation. The Austrians pressed the flank of the French forces and drove them back several miles. With the battle seemingly won, Melas took the time to regroup. Napoleon seized this last chance to urgently summon reinforcements. General Louis Charles Desaix marched his division to Napoleon’s aid, and with these fresh men, Napoleon rallied his troops and led them on a counterattack that hit the surprised Austrian advance guard.\n\nAnimated by this favorable turn of events, the French army pressed its advance and seized a victory from what had appeared to be certain defeat. Nearly half of the men in the Austrian army became casualties or prisoners. The French suffered about seven thousand casualties but seized some forty guns and owned the field of battle.\n\nNapoleon’s victory at Marengo demonstrated the extraordinary operational and tactical flexibility of the French way of warfare. When his subordinates understood his intent, they could respond with alacrity to nearly any kind of battlefield circumstance. However, this system relied upon a veteran force that was thoroughly trained, well supplied, and with high morale. As long as Napoleon could maintain these qualities in his armies, he would prove to be nearly invincible. At Marengo, he was just good enough to score another remarkable victory.\n\nUlm, October 1805\n\nThe Ulm campaign, one of Napoleon’s finest hours, demonstrated the superiority of the Grand Armée and revealed profound military weaknesses in the old monarchies of Europe. By rapid and decisive maneuver in the fall of 1805, Napoleon isolated and then captured an Austrian army, effectively eliminating one of France’s enemies in a single stroke.\n\nTrouble with the New Neighbor\n\nAmong the European monarchies, Austria faced an especially challenging strategic situation and was characteristically reluctant to open a war with France. The Habsburg Empire was a polyglot state, consisting of peoples with varying languages and cultural allegiances. The Habsburgs had expanded their holdings and now sought to maintain them in traditional fashion: by persistent diplomacy backed up with a judicious force of arms. Their strategic policy was to engage in limited conflicts that were waged only for slices of territory or key strongpoints. Major battles, heavy loss of life, and aggressive military action were considered too hazardous to the status quo. Furthermore, Napoleon had already defeated Austrian armies, so the Habsburg appetite for further confrontation was diminished.\n\nHowever, when Napoleon, as First Consul, promoted a bill introducing the French Empire, and was subsequently coronated at Notre Dame in December 1804, the direct threat to the monarchical order of Europe was clear. After Napoleon added to his titles the crown of the King of Northern Italy in March 1805, Emperor Francis of Austria knew that he must respond before France grew so powerful that its aspirations could not be contained in Western Europe—Napoleon would begin looking eastward for more conquests.\n\nA Stagnant Military\n\nUnfortunately for Emperor Francis, the Austrian army was in poor condition and still reeling from losses suffered in the wars of the First and Second Coalitions. Its artillery arm had traditionally performed well all the way back to the Seven Years War (1754–1763), but now both its guns and its tactical doctrine were outdated. The infantry mirrored the diverse makeup of the empire itself and hence faced problems of language and unity. The cavalry showed spirit in small actions but was unable to mass in main engagements, and it showed little propensity to gather intelligence or coordinate with the rest of the army. In all the branches, the officer corps was hidebound and hierarchical; too few rewards were offered for competence and initiative, too many as the privileges of patronage.\n\nThe titular Austrian commander in the field was the Archduke Ferdinand, brother of Emperor Francis, but most day-to-day decisions were made by General Karl Mack von Leiberich, a veteran staff officer who had experienced much campaigning in Germany and Italy, but who had never shown much imagination.\n\nMack was convinced that Napoleon would advance through the defiles of the Black Forest region in southern Germany. He assumed that France would not dare to offend Prussia by moving through central Germany, especially while talks were underway to convince Bavaria to align itself with the Allies.\n\nHis concept for the upcoming operation was to move along the south bank of the Danube as far as the Iller River, allowing time for Austrian envoys to parlay with the Bavarian elector. Mack would husband his strength and await the arrival of a Russian force marching westward. The combined armies could then march in the direction of Strausburg, taking the war directly to France. Before that union occurred, major battle was to be avoided.\n\nA key to Mack’s plan was the city of Ulm, situated on the border of Bavaria and Wurttemberg. There, fortified positions on the Michelsberg heights rose above the town, and Mack believed that this position was virtually impregnable.\n\nMilitary Flexibility Aids the French\n\nOn September 2, 1805, Mack set his army in motion, but problems immediately arose. Austrian troops were accustomed to drawing supplies from a system of depots and magazines along their route. As these were not available, Mack ordered his men to live off the country. However, they were not practiced at this, which led to confusion and delay as Austrian commanders tried for the first time to maneuver and provision themselves simultaneously.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon astutely took Mack’s measure as a cautious leader and correctly assessed that his French armies could move boldly with little risk. On September 25, the Third and Sixth Corps crossed the Rhine and moved to Stuttgart and the Danube. Napoleon’s scheme of maneuver was to send the Grande Armée to make a feint to confirm Mack’s suspicions, while the French main forces conducted a sweeping march to strike the Austrians from the north.\n\nNapoleon aggressively digested intelligence that came to his headquarters and adjusted his orders accordingly. While the French commanders sometimes complained and jostled for resources, they kept their formations moving independently and could capably respond to Napoleon’s directives. In contrast, Mack was largely paralyzed due to dated information and an army that was struggling to deploy. He continued to expect the French army to emerge from the Black Forest from the west, even as Napoleon’s men were closing off all of his routes as far east as Munich.\n\nWhen Bavaria chose to ally with France, Mack realized that his situation was dire. On October 8, portions of the Fifth Corps and Marshal Murat’s cavalry struck an Austrian column and defeated it at the Battle of Wertingen. The next day, units of French Marshal Ney’s corps carried the bridge at Gunzburg against stiff but ineffective Austrian opposition.\n\nUlm Not As Impregnable As Mack Thought\n\nNapoleon found it hard to believe that Ferdinand and Mack were waiting at Ulm, but when a French division came upon Mack’s main force in the city’s suburbs, the French force, although outnumbered, held off the Austrian foray long enough to convince Napoleon to concentrate his army against his isolated enemy.\n\nMack finally grasped at one chance to cut the French supply line on October 13. He sent two columns out of Ulm; the first marched toward Elchingen to secure a bridge there, while another moved farther north. Yet the next morning found Marshal Ney and his corps at the bridge. After flushing the Austrian skirmishers, Ney ordered a direct assault that shocked the Austrian defenders and earned Ney the title of Duke of Elchingen.\n\nOther French units now scattered the remaining Austrian detachments operating beyond the city of Ulm, prompting Archduke Ferdinand to conclude that he had seen enough. With a contingent of Austrian cavalry, Ferdinand fled back to Vienna.\n\nWhen men from Ney and Lannes’ corps arrived opposite the Austrian defenses at Michelsberg late in the day on October 15, Napoleon ordered the position taken by assault. Near the top of the heights the French infantry charged, dispersing Mack’s men after hand-to-hand fighting. Now the Austrian’s were completely trapped.\n\nWith no succor in sight, negotiations for the Austrians’ capitulation opened on October 17. Three days later, Mack agreed to surrender. The French victory was complete. The Austrians lost more than 60,000 of the 72,000 men with whom Ferdinand and Mack had opened the campaign. Napoleon not only sacked an entire Austrian army, but he also created the ideal conditions to face Kutuzov’s advancing Russians.\n\nDefeating the enemies of France one at a time was Napoleon’s best means of preserving and expanding the French Empire, and at Ulm his skills were at their highest. Once again, Napoleon had demonstrated the superiority of the Grand Armée’s way of war.\n\nTrafalgar, October 21, 1805\n\nThe naval Battle of Trafalgar was one of the greatest victories in British military history. Although Napoleon had determined by the time of the battle to take his army from the Channel coast to confront Austrian and Russian forces in central Europe, the conflict confirmed British naval superiority, a fact that would play a decisive role in the remaining years of warfare with France.\n\nThe Enemy Across the Waters\n\nNapoleon’s style of warfare was predicated upon fast-marching armies that could quickly mass in the face of an enemy to wage a decisive contest. French armies were highly trained, well led, and the perfect weapons to implement Napoleon’s aggressive and offensively oriented military strategy on land. Time and again, Napoleon and his marshals proved themselves superior to their enemies. French armies consistently defeated the armies of the continental monarchies, but Napoleon faced a challenge waging war against Britain because he could not bring the United Kingdom to a decisive battle.\n\nThe lifeblood of Britain, an island nation, was overseas trade, and the country’s navy was the guarantor of the nation’s commerce. Napoleon’s armies on the Continent could not directly challenge Britain’s naval strength, and so he sought other ways to strike at Britain proper. He attempted to interrupt British trade by closing Europe’s ports along the North Sea coast as well as throughout the Mediterranean. While somewhat effective, this was a slow and uncertain process and not in accord with Napoleon’s personality. Therefore, he sought to invade Britain and compel his enemy to yield to the French army, a strategy involving landpower and a formula to which he was well accustomed.\n\nWhen war between Britain and France resumed in May 1803, France had only fourteen ships of the line capable of getting underway. Even these were of limited utility because the British navy imposed a blockade on the important French ports of Boulogne, Brest, and Toulon. Napoleon directed that one hundred vessels be ready for sail from Dunkirk by mid-August, but when that date arrived, barely twenty were ready. Any notions of invasion were therefore tabled until 1804.\n\nNapoleon determined that an army of a hundred thousand men would require at least thirteen hundred transport craft. By the spring of 1804, about nine hundred were available, and the threat of a French invasion seemed to be growing. However, French preparations were incomplete and again the invasion was postponed.\n\nHis Admirals Were Not Like His Generals\n\nIn 1805, Napoleon once more resolved to cross the Channel. He ordered Admiral Villeneuve to lure the British fleet to the West Indies and then sail at speed back to France. While the British fleet was still searching for the French armada, Napoleon would lead his army into England. He required naval supremacy only long enough for his invasion barges to safely make the passage from the Grande Armée’s camps at Boulogne to the English landing beaches.\n\nWhile Villeneuve successfully reached the Indies with British Admiral Horatio Nelson conducting a tardy pursuit, the French admiral lost his courage upon his return. After a skirmish off Cape Finistere in July, he abandoned Napoleon’s directive to return to Brest and instead sailed south to the safety of the Spanish fleet and shelter in Cadiz.\n\nFrustrated that his naval strategy had unraveled, and preoccupied with diplomatic developments in central Europe, Napoleon turned his attention there. He marched his army eastward to confront a growing Austrian and Russian force, an action that would culminate in several victories, including Austerlitz that winter. But the British fleet was not forgotten, and Napoleon ordered Villeneuve to seek battle even though the original invasion scheme was no longer at issue.\n\nThe combined Franco-Spanish fleet included several powerful warships, but years of enforced inactivity under British blockades had eroded the skills Villeneuve’s officers and sailors. Nonetheless, Villeneuve dutifully sallied forth on October 20 with thirty-three ships of the line. He anticipated that Nelson would abandon traditional tactics and seek to break the French line; therefore, he placed his faster ships in the rear so they could identify the British attack and then sail quickly forward to close any gaps that Nelson might create.\n\nHowever, when Villeneuve reversed sailing direction shortly before the engagement, he threw his own line into confusion by not placing his fast ships in the van and slower ships in the rear. In the subsequent battle, Nelson aggressively attacked, striking in two columns that devastated the French order of battle.\n\nThe outcome was a decisive British victory. For the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars, the British navy sailed largely unhindered. The French navy was reduced to patrolling, coastal actions, and minor actions in the colonies. British losses were 449 killed and 1,214 wounded out of about 18,000 engaged on twenty-nine ships. The casualty toll among British leaders was very high: Nelson himself was killed, as were 22 percent of the British captains and 19 percent of the lieutenants. Carnage among the Franco-Spanish fleet was also high. Napoleon lost thirty-three ships of the line and suffered 2,218 dead, more than 1,100 wounded, and 7,000 captured.\n\nAusterlitz, December 2, 1805\n\nAlso known as the Battle of Three Emperors, the Battle of Austerlitz was one of Napoleon’s finest moments. His complete victory unhinged the Allied Third Coalition by compelling Austria to sue for peace and driving the Russians far to the east, where they were unable to muster a response until the following year.\n\nActions in Central Europe\n\nIn the autumn of 1805, Napoleon confronted the combined armies of Austria and Russia. The former was under Emperor Francis II, and the latter was led formally by Tsar Alexander of Russia but was under the command of the veteran general Kutuzov.\n\nIn October, Napoleon bagged an entire Austrian army under Mack at Ulm. When Kutuzov learned of this loss, he dismayed his Austrian ally by deciding to pull back, hence allowing the French to occupy Vienna. His scheme was to maneuver north of the Danube and gather strength. This was accomplished when a reinforcing army, which included the Tsar, arrived at Olmütz on November 24. This newly combined army consisted of more than 55,000 Russians and about 15,000 Austrians.\n\nKutuzov adopted a broad view of the strategic situation, and knowing that winter was about to set in, he argued that the Allied army should continue to retreat, drawing the French after them. In time, diminishing supplies would weaken the French invader, and it was possible the Prussians would eventually add their strength to the Coalition. However, the Tsar saw an opportunity to command the army that defeated Napoleon and put an end to the cancer of the French Revolution, and so he ordered his generals to seek battle.\n\nNapoleon, in characteristic fashion, wanted to accommodate the Allies by seeking a decisive battle. He knew that defending his lengthy lines of communication through southern Germany from France would be difficult. Ever sensitive to any weakness that might be appropriated by his political adversaries in Paris, Napoleon wanted to crush the Russians just as he had recently inflicted a crippling defeat on the Austrians at Ulm. He was also already contemplating war with Prussia, so he needed to confront the Russian host while it was within reach.\n\nOrdering his dispersed formations to concentrate, Napoleon moved north. His Grande Armée numbered slightly more than seventy thousand. The 85,000 Russians and Austrians outnumbered him, but Napoleon believed that he could yet use the terrain to create an advantage. He ordered his troops to the Austerlitz battleground, dominated in the center by a pronounced swath of high ground known as the Pratzen Heights.\n\nNapoleon did not fortify the heights, instead feigning weakness by withdrawing and deliberately showing a vulnerable right flank to his enemy. He fortified only the Santon Hill on his left. His plan was to lure the Russians to assault his right, and while his opponents were moving to the attack, he would launch his own grand assault in the center to break his enemy into two pieces, each which he could attack and defeat in detail.\n\nSome Plans Are Better Than Others\n\nThe Russian plan—which was overly complex because it required precise timing and near-perfect communications—neatly accommodated Napoleon’s deception. The Russians and Austrians intended to attack with five large columns, totaling nearly sixty thousand men, against Napoleon’s right flank, thereby cutting off the French from their line of retreat to Vienna. A secondary assault would hit the French left to prevent Napoleon from sending reinforcements to the other side of the battlefield. Finally, the Allies would deliver a crushing below against the French middle, terminating the battle and annihilating the French defenders.\n\nIn the early morning mist, the Russian and Austrian columns launched their attacks on the small village of Telnitz. The fighting was intense, but the weight of the Russian numbers soon told, and the French right grudgingly gave way. Slightly to the north was the village of Sokolnitz. Another Allied column struck here, soon joined by a third column. Again, after difficult combat, the French infantry slowly yielded.\n\nWatching this action unfold, and seeing that the masses of Allied infantry—despite their progress—were jumbled and losing cohesion, Napoleon ordered his main assault up the Pratzen to seize the high ground and hit the Allied flank. Just as the French infantry began their ascent, the sun broke through the clouds and fog. The Tsar spotted Napoleon’s attack and rushed a column of troops to repel the French. Savage combat ensued until, with their ammunition nearly exhausted, a final French bayonet assault carried the position. To the north, further French attacks also carried the heights after successive and bitterly contested assaults.\n\nRealizing that the loss of the Pratzen would entail the loss of the battle, the Grand Duke Constantine, the Tsar’s brother and commander of the Russian Imperial Guard, launched a counterattack in an attempt to restore the situation. His Guard fusiliers initially pushed back the French, but were then repulsed themselves. Next, the Grand Duke sent forward his horsemen, who crashed into the French ranks. Napoleon responded by throwing his own Guard cavalry into the fray, which sent the Russian horsemen reeling. The tables turned again when Constantine dispatched his final reserve formations, the Guard Cossacks and Chevalier Guard. Once more, the Russian assault bore fruit and the French found themselves hard pressed. Napoleon likewise committed his final reserves, ordering into the attack his personal guard troops. Only when fresh French infantry, moving by a different route, struck the exposed Russian flank did Napoleon gain the upper hand. Given room to maneuver, his Guard horse artillery unlimbered and raked the faltering Russian formations with heavy fire, shattering the Russian ranks.\n\nAnother Decisive French Victory\n\nWith his center successful, Napoleon ordered new assaults in the south. The Russians fought determinedly, but successive French attacks ultimately put them to flight. Their retreat became a rout as many thousands who fled across the frozen ponds in the area fell through the ice of the Satschan lakes and drowned. The Allies lost 182 guns, forty-five standards, and about 25,000 men dead, wounded, and captured. The French counted 8,500 casualties and the loss of a single standard. Napoleon had won the decisive battle he sought.\n\nOn December 4, Austria capitulated in the form of an armistice that was made formal on December 27 when that nation exited the war by the Treaty of Pressburg. Tsar Alexander moved his forces eastward, unmolested by Napoleon. The Grande Armée repositioned from Moravia to the west and southern Germany.\n\nBeyond the immediate political benefits of securing France’s strategic position and splitting the Allied coalition, the French triumph demonstrated the superiority of Napoleon’s training and organizational initiatives. He showed as well that he was a brilliant tactician who could depend on a cadre of aggressive officers to implement his directives. Napoleon’s formula of dominant maneuver, combined arms, and hard-fighting troops would continue to change the nature of war in Europe for generations to follow.\n\nJena, October 14, 1806\n\nThe battle at Jena, and its simultaneous twin at Auerstädt, affirmed once more the supremacy of Napoleon’s aggressive style of warfare. As a result of these French victories, Prussian military power was shattered and the Prussian state entered a period of intense recrimination and re-examination. French influence, meanwhile, reached a new pinnacle of authority in continental Europe.\n\nA Long Time Since Frederick the Great\n\nIn the late summer of 1806, Prussia found itself at war with France but undecided about the course of action to pursue. The Prussian General Staff was indecisive; the Prussian army, while enjoying a proud reputation from its famous campaigns of the Seven Years War a half-century earlier, had failed to adapt to the changing ways of war brought on by the French Revolution.\n\nMore than 150,000 French troops were stationed in southern Germany, and while the Prussians could muster an equal number of men, their army was insufficiently trained and not organized for rapid movement. The Prussians, led by King Frederick William III and his principal commanders, Prince Hohenlohe and the Duke of Brunswick, rationalized their hesitation on the belief that Napoleon would give them time to respond.\n\nAlthough Napoleon did want peace to be maintained (at least for a time), by mid-September French diplomats and spies were informing him that open conflict was fast approaching. On September 18, he issued orders to his corps to begin consolidating and to ready themselves for an active campaign. Bonaparte’s scheme was to march through the hills and forest of the Thuringerwald and into the valley of the Saale River, thereby placing his army between the main Prussian force and the capital of Berlin. If the Prussians advanced, he would be in position to strike their flank; if they retired, he was confident that he could pin them against one of the interceding river lines.\n\nThe French Invade\n\nIn typical Napoleonic fashion, the French army moved with tremendous alacrity, crossing the Saxon frontier on October 8 with 180,000 men organized into three columns, each within mutual supporting distance. The left column consisted of Lannes’ Fifth Corps and Augereau’s Seventh Corps. In the middle were Bernadotte’s First Corps and Davout’s Third Corps, both supported by cavalry. Soult’s Fourth Corps, Ney’s Sixth Corps, and a Bavarian force made up the right.\n\nOn October 13, Napoleon reached the town of Jena, where reports from Lannes’ corps in the lead indicated that a large Prussian force was assembled on the large Landgrafenberg plateau across the French front. While a dense fog prevented a thorough reconnaissance, Napoleon believed he was encountering the main Prussian army. Not wanting his adversary to escape, he prepared to attack.\n\nWhile Lannes’ troops passed through Jena and ascended the heights, Napoleon ordered Marshals Soult and Ney, along with the Imperial Guard infantry and two divisions of cavalry, to march to the scene in support. He would open the assault with only about 25,000 men, but by nightfall could expect another 100,000 to arrive.\n\nAt Jena\n\nThe morning of October 14, 1806, dawned with the fog still masking the Prussian troop dispositions. Nonetheless, Napoleon needed space atop the plateau to align his oncoming formations, and confident of his army, he ordered Lannes to advance. The men of the Fifth Corps moved ahead, firing blindly into the fog and making slow but steady success.\n\nThe Prussian commander, Prince Hohenlohe, did not believe that Napoleon wanted a general battle. His mission was to serve as a blocking force while the Duke of Brunswick attempted to maneuver the main body of the Prussian army between Berlin and the French columns. The French attack atop the plateau, however, offered Hohenlohe little choice. He decided to hit back with his forty thousand troops and throw the French off the Landgrafenberg plateau.\n\nThe initial Prussian assaults blunted Lannes’ advance and bought time for the Prussians to reposition. Soon thereafter, the leading elements of Soult’s corps, who were seeking room to maneuver to the right of Lannes flank, encountered troops of Prussian General Holtzendorff. Prussian cavalry charges failed to penetrate the French infantry, and the French advance continued.\n\nBy mid-morning, there was a lull in the fighting as each side aligned reserve units. "
