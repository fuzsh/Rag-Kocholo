The event was organized to celebrate the coronation of King Charles III.\n\nCrowds may have cheered coronation, but not everybody is a fan of the royals\n\nand\n\nDozens of anti-monarchy activists and other protesters were arrested on Saturday, a reminder not everyone in the United Kingdom has been swept up in the royal adulation dominating TV screens.\n\nSix people from the anti-royalist campaign group Republic and 19 people from environmental activists Just Stop Oil were detained by the Metropolitan Police in central London, near to where Charles was being crowned, according to the groups.\n\nFor free speech campaigners and some onlookers, it was a chilling scene, even on a day where polls and anecdote suggest that apathy — rather than royal or anti-monarchical fervor — is the prevailing mood in Britain.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCould royal drama spoil the party?\n\nand\n\nAfter the coronation, King Charles will have to navigate scandals and tricky family relationships that could tarnish his reign and the monarchy itself.\n\nPast and ongoing issues with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and even his wife, Camilla, could overshadow the new king’s rule if they are not carefully managed, royal experts say.\n\n“The royal family is one of the most visible and tenuous aspects of the crown’s overall brand,” said Cele Otnes, co-author of “Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture.” “It’s hard to manage people,” she added.\n\nRead full story here.\n\nGun salutes were fired at the exact moment the St. Edward’s Crown was placed on the king’s head from military bases across the U.K.\n\nThe King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery was among the units that fired a six-gun salvo in which all six guns fire once at the same time.\n\nPlanes and helicopters take part in coronation flyby\n\nPlanes and helicopters from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force are flying over The Mall, the grand road leading from Buckingham Palace in central London, to mark the coronation of King Charles and Queen Camilla.\n\nMore than 60 aircraft had been slated to take part, but Britain's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the event was scaled back because of “unsuitable weather conditions.”\n\nThe display was originally meant to last for six minutes, but the scaled-down version will last for less than half of that time, the ministry said.\n\nApplause from the crowds wasn't just reserved for royalty — there were also cheers for the street sweepers that followed the procession to Buckingham Palace.\n\n150 Cavalier King Charles spaniels to descend on the King’s Road\n\nAbout 150 Cavalier King Charles spaniels, some in regal tiaras, will march down one of London’s most historic roads to mark the coronation.\n\nJenny Matthews, who owns a pet grooming service, cafe and boutique on the King’s Road, came up with the idea for the canine parade. “I just thought this is a no-brainer,” Matthews, 53, told NBC News. “It’s our King Charles III’s coronation day. What more can we do for him than to gather as many King Charles spaniel dogs as possible and parade down his road, it’s the King’s Road?”\n\nSophie Bradley from the London neighborhood of Hammersmith was one of the lucky ones to be selected. Her dog Amber, 6, is a therapy dog and by Bradley’s account is very excited to take part in the parade.\n\n“Forget the British weather,” Bradley, 51, said, as it rained heavily outside. “It’s once in a lifetime, it’s history making… To celebrate the king and his coronation. I can’t think of a better way to spend the day, to be honest with you, amongst friends.”\n\nMembers of the U.K. and Commonwealth Armed Forces standing in the Buckingham Palace gardens are offering a collective salute to the newly crowned king and queen.\n\nZoo animals take part in the day's festivities\n\nAnimals at London Zoo were encouraged to take part in the celebrations by chowing down on fruit and vegetables for “The Big Lunch.”\n\nThe zoo posted pictures of gorillas and a tortoise eating on its Twitter feed.\n\nThe Big Lunch is a series of community meals held across streets, parks and gardens organized by British environmental charity the Eden Project.\n\nRoyal fan Ben Weller was visibly emotional as he watched the coronation ceremony on a screen in London’s Hyde Park.\n\nCrowds cheer as the procession comes to an end\n\nCrowds clapped and cheered as the procession to Buckingham Palace came to an end.\n\nWellwishers have been gathered for hours, mostly spent in the rain, to catch a glimpse of the newly crowned king and queen.\n\nDrums began to beat again as members of the U.K. and Commonwealth Armed Forces prepared to offer a collective salute to Charles and Camilla.\n\nKing and queen arrive at Buckingham Palace\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived at Buckingham Palace following the procession from Westminster Abbey.\n\nNext the couple are expected to be seen on the palace's balcony, from where monarchs traditionally wave to crowds of well-wishers.\n\nSea of color surrounds the Gold State Coach\n\nDressed in their full military regalia, their red, blue and black uniforms braided with gold, more than 4,000 troops are taking part in the mile-long procession escorting the king and queen back to Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt the center, drawn by 8 Windsor Grey horses, the Gold State Coach, that has been used at every coronation since that of William IV in 1831.\n\nBehind them in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, Kate and William sat opposite their three children, George, Charlotte and Louis, who waved at the cheering crowds.\n\nKeeping them in time as they marched, music and drums from the accompanying military band.\n\nPrince Charles Cinema refuses to change its name\n\nA movie theater in London named the Prince Charles Cinema is letting it be known loud and clear that it will not be changing its name to reflect the king's current title, even after he's been crowned.\n\n\"Not now, not ever!\" the cinema said in a tweet pinned to its Twitter page. The cinema shared a photo of its marquee, which says it all:\n\nWhat is Princess Anne's role in the coronation?\n\nPrincess Anne, Queen Elizabeth's only daughter, is responsible for the monarch’s personal safety during the coronation and so has a big role in the ceremonies.\n\nIn the role, officially called Gold-Stick-in-Waiting, Anne, 72, is leading the procession from Westminster Abbey back to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe second of four children, Anne was given the title of Princess Royal in June 1987. She is older than her brothers, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.\n\nWhen she was born in 1950, she was third in line to the throne. Now, she is 16th in line for the throne because of an old law that allowed men to skip over women in the line of succession.\n\nProcession back to Buckingham Palace underway\n\nBells tolled across the country as King Charles and his queen left Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe royal couple passed the Chief Marshal, who ordered procession groups and street liners to come to attention.\n\nThe Chief Marshal also ordered for ceremonial signal flags to go up and ceremonial batons carried by the procession marshals to be raised as the king and queen boarded the gold state coach.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping congratulates King Charles\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan sent a congratulatory message to Charles and Camilla and called for increased cooperation between the countries as both adapt to a quickly changing world.\n\n\"Both China and the U.K. are permanent members of the UN Security Council, and should take a long-term and strategic perspective to jointly promote the historic trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results,\" according to the statement from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIt added: \"China is willing to work together with the UK to enhance people-to-people friendship, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges, so as to better benefit the two countries and the world with a stable and mutually beneficial China-UK relationship.\"\n\nThe king departs Westminster Abbey\n\nThe crowned king is now departing Westminster Abbey.\n\nHe will begin the coronation procession from the church to Buckingham Palace, with the procession expected to last around 30 minutes.\n\nThis time, the monarchs will travel in the Gold State Coach which will be draw by 8 Windsor Grey horses.\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nCelebrations for the king's coronation have been unfolding near and far, with villagers on Vanuatu’s Tanna island also marking the occasion.\n\nVillagers held up a photo of Charles to commemorate his coronation and gave speeches. The Tanna celebration of King Charles stems from a longstanding relationship with his father, the late Prince Philip.\n\nThe villagers linked Philip to a legend of a pale-skinned son of a mountain god who traveled across the seas in search of a rich and powerful woman to marry, according to Reuters. Anthropologists believe Philip became linked to the legend in the 1960s when Vanuatu was an Anglo-French colony known as the New Hebrides.\n\nPhilip maintained a relationship with the group for 50 years until his death in 2021.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen: 'A symbol of stability and continuity'\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted her congratulations to Charles and Camilla.\n\n\"The Coronation is a testament to the enduring strength of the British monarchy. A symbol of stability and continuity,\" she said.\n\n'Big lunches' happening across the U.K. in honor of coronation\n\nAlongside street parties and celebratory teas, a number of “big lunches” will take place across the U.K. to mark the coronation.\n\nThe community meals in streets, parks and gardens were organized by British environmental charity the Eden Project.\n\nA number took places during 2022’s jubilee celebrations for the late Queen Elizabeth II, the largest held on a long table at Windsor Castle that was almost 900-yards long.\n\nThis year’s lunches are likely to feature a “coronation quiche” — a spinach, broad bean and tarragon pie — designated the official recipe of the day.\n\nThe largest military ceremonial operation for 70 years\n\nOver 6,000 women and men from the U.K.'s Armed Forces are taking part in today's historic coronation. It is the largest military ceremonial operation for 70 years, according to the British government.\n\nSoldiers, sailors, and aviators from across the UK and the Commonwealth nations are participating in the two processions accompanying Charles and Camilla to and from Westminster Abbey.\n\nOver the last few weeks, Armed Forces personnel have been busy meticulously rehearsing their displays of pageantry, in celebration of their new Commander-in-Chief, Charles.\n\nGospel music included in coronation for the first time\n\nGospel music was included in the coronation for the first time when the Ascension Choir sang Alleluia (O Sing Praises).\n\nGospel singers were handpicked for the event, to join the choir.\n\nTheir inclusion was requested by King Charles, according to British composer Debbie Wiseman, who arranged the performance. She told British radio station Classic FM, that he “very much wanted a gospel choir included in the service.”\n\nThe only surviving regalia from medieval coronations\n\nIn 1649, most of England’s regalia were destroyed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell after the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England.\n\nThe silver gilt coronation spoon — which is used to dispense the anointing oil — survived. It is the oldest and one of the most sacred items in the whole ceremony, and was likely made for Henry II or Richard I.\n\nIt is first recorded to have been used at Westminster Abbey in 1349, when the bubonic plague known as the Black Death was spreading across the country.\n\nThe spoon has two indentations, suggesting it was made for the archbishop to dip two fingers into holy oil to anoint the sovereign — its exact use since the coronation of Charles II in 1661.\n\nWide array of religious leaders play role in coronation for first time\n\nAn wide array of religious leaders participated in the coronation for the first time on Saturday.\n\nJewish, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim representatives joined Catholic and Presbyterian leaders, among others, to take part in the Anglican Christian ceremony.\n\nKing Charles III's coronation was also be the first to include female bishops from within the Church of England and music from gospel singers.\n\nMan traveled from Beijing 'because I wanted to be in England when it happened'\n\nIt was very wet, but thousands of people watched the crowning of King Charles III in central London’s Green Park.\n\nThe traditional British weather didn’t stop the enjoyment of traditional British pomp and ceremony, especially for Ian Lewis, who traveled from his home in the Chinese capital Beijing to watch the ceremony.\n\nLewis, 59, who hails from Sussex in southern England, said he “wanted to be in England when it happened.”\n\nHe said that he thought Charles was a good man and would be a good king, but added that he hoped he “doesn’t go overboard with the idea of a slimmed down monarchy. We want a proper monarchy.”\n\nOutside Westminster Abbey, wellwishers been braving the rain for hours now to take part in today's historic event.\n\nChoir sings coronation anthem composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\nA choir has been singing the coronation anthem, Make a Joyful Noise, composed by English composer and Broadway icon Andrew Lloyd Webber and a Coronation March by the Oscar-nominated Scottish composer, Patrick Doyle.\n\n\"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord for he hath done marvelous things. And his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God,\" it begins.\n\nCoronation is sign that times have changed, chief rabbi says\n\nAmong the U.K.’s five national faith leaders attending the ceremony is Sir Ephraim Mirvis, the U.K.’s chief rabbi, who walked to the ceremony because Saturday is Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.\n\nIn an emotional post on Twitter, Mirvis noted that conditions had changed for Jews in Britain over the centuries.\n\n“On 3 September 1189, Richard I was crowned King in Westminster Abbey. Jews were barred from attending, but in a spirit of heartfelt goodwill, some Jewish leaders arrived bearing gifts for the new king. They were informed that Jews were not welcome, whereupon Richard’s courtiers stripped and flogged them, and then flung them out of court,” he wrote.\n\nA rumor then spread that the king had given the order for Jews to be attacked, and many homes were destroyed and some Jews were forcibly converted, Mirvis added. Around 30 were murdered, including Rabbi Jacob of Orléans, the most senior rabbi in England at that time.\n\nThe “tragic events stand in sharp contrast to our experience as Jews in 21st Century Britain,” Mirvis said.\n\nCamilla crowned without the controversial Kohinoor diamond\n\nQueen consort, Camilla, has been given the crown of Queen Mary, which today, does not feature the controversial Kohinoor diamond.\n\nWorn as a brooch by Queen Victoria, the Kohinoor, one of the largest diamonds in the world, was one of many plunders of British imperialism. Eventually becoming part of the crown jewels, it was set in a crown last worn by Charles’s grandmother, the Queen Mother, during her coronation. India and Pakistan have demanded it be returned.\n\nThe Queen Mary crown has instead been reset with the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds, in tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth, Buckingham Palace said, adding that this was the first time in history and existing crown was being used for the coronation of a consort.\n\nThe stone of destiny: a symbol of Scotland’s monarchy\n\nThe coronation chair was built in around 1300 to house the Stone of Destiny, also known as the Stone of Scone.\n\nIt might sound like something out of a Marvel film, but in fact, it is a 336-pound pinkish sandstone that is a symbol of Scotland’s monarchy, which sits beneath the coronation chair.\n\nFor centuries, the stone of destiny, also known as the Stone of Scone was used to crown Scottish kings. That’s until it was seized by Edward I, known as “Scottorum malleus,” or “Hammer of the Scots.”\n\nIt stood for centuries in Westminster Abbey, until four Scottish students stole it on Christmas Day 1950, sparking a nation-wide manhunt. It mysteriously appeared three months later on the altar of Arbroath Abbey in western Scotland, before it was put back under the coronation chair in 1952.\n\nIn 1996, Prime Minister John Major moved it permanently from Westminster to Edinburgh Castle, where it still resides. It was transported to Westminster Abbey for the coronation.\n\nThe U.K. is the only European country that still uses regalia — symbols of royalty like the crown, orb and scepters — in coronations, according to the Royal Family website.\n\nIt is also the only country in Europe to hold a lavish coronation ceremony.\n\nThe individual objects symbolize different aspects of the service and responsibilities of the monarch.\n\nDuring the coronation, Charles has been presented with several regalia in key moments of the coronation ceremony.\n\nGun salutes from military bases across the country and on His Majesty’s ships at sea have sounded as the king was crowned.\n\nIn all corners of the Union, including at firing stations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, gun salutes sounded at the moment of the king's coronation to celebrate the history moment.\n\nKing Charles III is crowned\n\nKing Charles III has been crowned.\n\nAs a boy, Charles watched his own mother, Elizabeth II, practicing wearing St. Edward’s Crown — a crown made in 1661 that weighs a hefty 5 pounds — before her coronation in 1953.\n\nNow, 70 years later, the archbishop of Canterbury has placed St. Edward’s Crown on the head of the king.\n\nA marriage to the nation\n\nThe Archbishop also placed the Sovereign’s ring on the fourth finger of Charle's hand in the investiture section of the ceremony.\n\nThe ring has a blue octagonal sapphire in a gold setting overlaid with five rubies forming a cross representing the cross of St. George seen in the English flag. It was made for the coronation of William IV in 1831.\n\nJust like a wedding, the Sovereign's ring symbolizes the king’s marriage to the nation.\n\nThe king receives the Sovereign’s orb\n\nMeasuring almost 11 inches and weighing nearly 3 pounds, the orb represents the monarch’s power and symbolizes the Christian world. It was placed in Charles’ right hand as he was invested with the symbols of sovereignty.\n\nThe orb was made for Charles II’s coronation in 1661 by royal goldsmith Robert Vyner. The sphere is constructed from hollow gold and is adorned with emeralds, rubies, sapphires, diamonds, pearls, an amethyst and a glass stone. It is divided into three sections with bands of jewels, for each of the three continents known in the medieval period.\n\nWhat is the Sword of Offering?\n\nMade in 1820, the Sword of Offering has a steel blade, mounted in gold and set with jewels, which form a rose, a thistle, a shamrock, oak leaves, acorns and lions’ heads. The sword, which is contained in a gold-covered leather scabbard, continues the knightly theme of the ancient ceremony.\n\nThe sword was just one of the royal symbols given to the monarch during the investiture, when the sovereign is robed and presented with a number of symbolic ornaments. The archbishop blessed the sword and handed it to Charles with the injunction that it should be used for the protection of good and the punishment of evil.\n\nFor 700 years, monarchs have been crowned on the coronation chair\n\nSince the 13th century, all English and British sovereigns have been crowned while sitting atop the coronation chair, also known as St. Edward’s Chair or King Edward’s Chair.\n\nIt was commissioned by Edward I to house the stone of destiny, and first featured in the coronation of Edward II in 1308 (although there is some deliberation over whether he was actually crowned on it).\n\nThe coronation chair has left Westminster Abbey only twice: once in 1657, when Oliver Cromwell was installed as lord protector at Westminster Hall during England’s brief period as a republic, and again during World War II, when it was taken to Gloucester Cathedral in western England.\n\nDespite its significance in the crowning of monarchs for over 600 years, the coronation chair has been vandalized by schoolboys from nearby Westminster School and by tourists, one of whom wrote: “P. Abbott slept in this chair 5-6 July 1800.”\n\nI'm just here for the party, German says\n\nShe's not a huge fan of the royal family. Instead Nicole Domnofski said she came for the party.\n\nThe German national, 55, said she traveled from the city of Dusseldorf and had hoped to watch the proceedings from The Mall, a grand processional route running from Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square in central London.\n\nBut she said the crowds were too heavy, so she retreated to Partridges, a famous family run store in Chelsea, west London. There she watched the coronation on a big screen, draped in Union Jack flag.\n\nAs the camera panned to William and Kate she \"oohed,\" along with the rest of the crowd. “They are the ones I am most excited to see,” Domnofski said.\n\nCharles is first U.K. monarch to be anointed in oils made from olives, not 'whale vomit'\n\nCharles is the first British monarch to be anointed in coronation oils made from olives, not from ambergris — a valuable and rare ingredient used in luxury perfumes and known as \"whale vomit.\"\n\nLast used at the coronation of the late Queen Elizabeth II, ambergris is a dullish gray slurry which forms in a sperm whale's small intestine and renowned for its sweet, musky, smell.\n\nKing Charles' coronation oil was made using olives harvested from groves at the Monastery of Mary Magdalene and the Monastery of the Ascension in Jerusalem's old city, before being consecrated at the Church of Holy Sepulchre in March, where Christians believe Jesus was crucified. It was perfumed using sesame, rose, jasmine, cinnamon, neroli, benzoin, amber and orange blossom.\n\nWhat is the anointing screen?\n\nThere is a tree embroidered on the anointing screen used for the anointing of Charles, the most sacred moment of the coronation: it is the Commonwealth tree.\n\nOn each leaf, the names of all 56 Commonwealth nations are embroidered.\n\nThe screen is veiling this significant moment by purpose: the only witnesses to the anointment are the king, the archbishop, and God. This sacred moment in the coronation will not be seen by the millions of spectators around the world.\n\nCharles being anointed with sacred oil Elizabeth I once referred to as 'grease'\n\nIn another Anglican Christian ceremony and centuries-old tradition, Charles is being anointed, blessed and consecrated by Welby.\n\nThe process of anointing is a deeply religious moment, similar to a baptism. The Dean of Westminster is pouring holy oil from the Ampulla into the Coronation Spoon, and the Archbishop is anointing Charles on the hands, chest and head. It is inspired by the biblical anointing of King Solomon.\n\nThe new oil Charles is being anointed with was made with olives harvested from two groves around monasteries on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, one being the Monastery of Mary Magdalene the burial place of the King's paternal grandmother, Princess Andrew of Greece.\n\nElizabeth I once referred to the sacred oil as “grease” that “smelt ill,” according to George Gross, a theologian at King’s College London.\n\nKaty Perry looking for her seat has become the first big meme of the coronation\n\nKaty Perry Perry’s arrival at the coronation service has inspired several memes on social media, including a moment captured on camera where the singer struggled to find her seat for the ceremony that has since gone viral on Twitter. People are, in their own words, “obsessed” with the moment.\n\nIn the short clip, both Perry and Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, crane their necks as they wander around the church on a quest to find their seats for the coronation.\n\nPerry has a large role to play during the remainder of the coronation weekend’s schedule. Alongside her fellow “American Idol” judge Lionel Richie, Andrea Bocelli, and the British pop group Take That, Perry will be headlining the king’s coronation concert at Windsor Castle on May 7.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was just reading from the Epistle to the Colossians.\n\nThe reading began with the lines: \"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.\"\n\nCeremony features 12 new pieces of music\n\nResponsibility for the music featured in the ceremony fell to the Master of the King’s “Musick,” Judith Weir, who became the first female master of the Queen’s music in 2014.\n\nShe worked alongside Westminster Abbey’s Master of Music Andrew Nethsingha.\n\nDuring the ceremony 12 new commissions will be performed, including a Coronation Anthem by the English composer and Broadway icon Andrew Lloyd Webber and a Coronation March by the Oscar-nominated Scottish composer, Patrick Doyle.\n\nThe service will for the first time include languages from around the U.K., including a prayer in Welsh and a hymn sung in Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish Gaelic.\n\nand\n\nA coronation offers a rare glimpse into the British royal family’s famous treasures, the crown jewels, which are normally locked away in the medieval Tower of London.\n\nThe crowning of King Charles III on Saturday will see the monarchy’s regalia and finery, seen in public only on important state occasions, on full display.\n\nRead our guide for a tour of what will be on display and what it all means.\n\nCharles takes the coronation oath to maintain the Protestant faith\n\nCharles is now taking the coronation oath, a legal requirement since a law passed in 1689 compelled King William and Queen Mary to promise to maintain the Protestant faith.\n\n\"I Charles do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God profess, testify, and declare that I am a faithful Protestant, and that I will, according to the true intent of the enactments which secure the Protestant succession to the Throne, uphold and maintain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law,\" he said.\n\nThe same year, Parliament passed a law that bans any Catholic from taking the throne — a rule still in effect.\n\nThis law goes back to Tudor England in the 1500's, when King Henry VIII broke his Catholic ties and founded the Church of England, so that he could end his first marriage to Spain's Catherine of Aragon. Henry, who infamously married six times, wanted to get a divorce so he could marry Anne Boleyn, one of his wife’s ladies-in-waiting, who was later beheaded under his orders.\n\nA brief history of Westminster Abbey\n\nWestminster Abbey has been the place where British monarchs are crowned since 1066.\n\nIt is also the final resting place for more than 3,300 people. In total 17 monarchs have been buried there, including Queen Elizabeth I who was laid to rest in 1603.\n\nCharles is the 40th monarch to be crowned in the abbey, and the 10th monarch to be crowned since the U.S. Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\n'God save King Charles' rings out in Westminster Abbey\n\nStanding next to the 700-year-old coronation chair, Charles turned to face the four sides of the abbey to be proclaimed the “undoubted king” before the congregation.\n\nThe Archbishop made the first declaration. For the first time, the ensuing declarations are being made by the Lady of the Garter and the Lady of the Thistle — representing the oldest orders of chivalry in England and Scotland — and a George Cross holder from the U.K.'s armed forces.\n\nThe congregation are now jubilantly declaring, “God save King Charles!” followed by trumpets with each declaration.\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Wales wears a tiara on the way to the coronation service.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury begins to deliver his liturgy\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has begun to deliver his liturgy, or sermon.\n\nThe theme of the Liturgy is “Called to Serve,” a reflection of the commitment that Charles will make to \"serve God and the people, and the decades of public service of The King and The Queen,\" according to a statement released by Welby's website.\n\nAs is tradition, Welby has invited millions of Britons watching to “make their homage, in heart and voice, to their undoubted King, defender of all.”\n\nWho are the Pages of Honor?\n\nKing Charles's eldest grandson Prince George is one of four Pages of Honor chosen to participate in today's ceremony.\n\nPrince William's son is the youngest future king to have an official role in the coronation.\n\nTogether with Lord Oliver Cholmondeley, Master Nicholas Barclay, and Master Ralph Tollemanche, he has been tasked with carrying the long train of Charles’ robes.\n\nThe entire coronation ceremony is rooted in longstanding tradition and Christian symbolism. But for the first time, members of other faith traditions — a reflection of Britain's many diverse communities — will also play an active role in the service.\n\nAs Charles entered Westminster Abbey, rows of choir singers began singing the traditional Anglican anthem, “I was Glad,” a piece based on Psalm 122 that has been used at this precise moment in coronations since at least 1626.\n\nThe coronation is presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, whose role in the ceremony has remained unchanged since 1066.\n\nCoronation service of King Charles III begins\n\nThe coronation service of King Charles III has started at 11 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET).\n\nThis is the first time the U.K. is holding a coronation service of a male monarch since the coronation of Charles' grandfather and Elizabeth's father, George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, who came to be known as the Queen Mother under her daughter's reign, on May 12, 1937.\n\nThe day Charles' grandfather George VI was crowned king had originally been chosen for the coronation of his brother, Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne to marry American socialite, Wallis Simpson.\n\nKate’s jewelry nods towards Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth II\n\nPrincess Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge arrived at Westminster Abbey wearing jewelry that made subtle nods to the late Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth II with her choice of jewelry for the ceremony.\n\nShe is wearing the George VI festoon necklace, a triple-row necklace of diamonds that was commissioned by Elizabeth’s father.\n\nElizabeth wore this on several notable occasions including her White House state dinner in 2007.\n\nKate is also wearing a pair of Princess Diana’s diamond-and-pearl earrings.\n\nPrince Harry and Prince Andrew seated in third row\n\nPrince Harry and Prince Andrew appear to be seated in the third row at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAndrew arrived wearing the velvet robes and gold insignia that denotes him as a Knight of the Garter, a ceremonial role he has held since the late Queen bestowed it upon him in 2006.\n\nIn contrast, Prince Harry wore a simple morning suit as requested by Buckingham Palace, not the military uniform he has previously worn in royal ceremonies, including the Queen's funeral last year.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe king and queen arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the coronation, entering through the Great West door of the ancient church.\n\nAhead of them a long procession of uniformed officials and clergy paraded and a fanfare sounded.\n\nKing Charles wore the \"Robe of State,\" a ceremonial fur cloak, and long red train carried by four pages, including grandson Prince George. Queen Camilla wore a floor-length white and gold brocade dress and Coronation Necklace, originally made for Queen Victoria in 1858. Queen Elizabeth III wore it for her coronation in 1953.\n\nThe family controversies hanging over the coronation\n\nand\n\nScandals and tricky family relationships could tarnish King Charles's reign and the monarchy itself.\n\nPast and ongoing issues with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and even his wife, Camilla, could overshadow the new king’s rule if they are not carefully managed, royal experts say.\n\n“The royal family is one of the most visible and tenuous aspects of the crown’s overall brand,” said Cele Otnes, co-author of “Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture.” “It’s hard to manage people,” she added.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nPrinces Harry and Andrew arrive at Westminster Abbey\n\nPrince Harry, Charles’ youngest son, and King Charles III’s brother, the disgraced Prince Andrew, have arrived in Westminster Abbey ahead of coronation.\n\nVideo of arrivals showed Harry entering the church as the king made his way from Buckingham Palace. While he will attend the coronation service, he and his uncle do not have official roles in the celebrations.\n\nHarry's wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has remained in California, where she is celebrating their son Archie's 4th birthday.\n\nCelebrations begin on London's famous King's Road\n\nIt’s called King’s Road for a reason. At one time only King Charles II could use it to travel between his royal residences, historian Daniel Pembrey told NBC News Saturday.\n\nEventually the aristocracy were allowed to use it and more recent years, the road in west London has been a stomping ground for some of the most popular figures in British music and fashion.\n\nMary Quant, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were all regulars in the 1960’s and the following decade Vivienne Westwood opened her store Sex on it. Notorious punk group the Sex Pistols would meet there regularly.\n\nPembrey, who has lived in the area for 12 years, said he hoped coronation day would give “people a chance to think about something bigger and more joyful,.”\n\nThe road will see a parade of the U.K.’s veteran community and some 100 King Charles Spaniel Dogs later in the day.\n\nFrom queen consort to Queen Camilla\n\nYou'll notice that we've been referring to King Charles' wife Camilla as Queen Camilla — not \"queen consort\" as she was previously named.\n\nWith the cover of the order of service for today's coronation titled: “The Coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla\" it appears that transition is over.\n\nCharles and Camilla were married on April 9, 2005, after famously having a long-term extramarital affair while Charles was still married to Princess Diana. Their marriage was also a groundbreaking event since it entailed the heir to the throne marrying a divorcee — something previously taboo.\n\nCrucially, Camilla appeared to have won the support of the late queen. In 2022, Elizabeth made clear that Camilla should instead be queen consort upon Charles’ ascension. And in recent weeks, it was confirmed she would simply be titled Queen Camilla.\n\nWellwishers were cheering so loudly that they appeared to spook some of the horses, which briefly broke out of formation.\n\nCrowds cheer as Charles and Camilla pass by\n\nCrowds cheered loudly as King Charles and Queen Camilla passed by in the Diamond Jubilee Coach as their carriage carried them from Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe king and queen will make their way to Westminster Abbey, as wellwishers watch on along the procession route.\n\nThe king's procession begins from Buckingham Palace\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey has begun.\n\nThe royal couple will travel in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, which was first used by Queen Elizabeth II in 2014.\n\nThe carriage's interior is inlaid with wood, metal and other materials from churches and royal places with specific connections to Britain and its history.\n\nIt also includes material from historic ships, including the Mary Rose, a warship from Henry VIII's reign. The gilded crown on the top of the carriage was carved from oak from HMS Victory, a British warships ordered in the 1750s.\n\nAlthough it carries many remnants of the past, the carriage has a distinct modern feature: it is air-conditioned and has hydraulic suspension. Six Windsor Grey horses — used only by the sovereign, and occasionally for a visiting head of state — are pulling the carriage.\n\nPolice officers detain 'Just Stop Oil' protester\n\nPolice officers could be seen detaining a member of the Just Stop Oil protest group as people gather to watch the king's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey.The campaigning organization said that 20 of its supporters had been arrested for wearing T-shirts with the group's name \"at the coronation.\" Just Stop Oil is demanding no new licenses or consents for any fossil fuel projects in the U.K.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police did not confirm the arrests.\n\nand\n\nThe ritual of crowning a new king or queen is more than 1,000 years old. And each of the objects used has its own importance and symbolism in sealing a bond among the monarch, the people, the church and God.\n\nRead our guide to what the main items used in King Charles III’s coronation on Saturday mean.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla get onto royal carriage\n\nKing Charles and his wife Queen Camilla have been seen in Buckingham Palace boarding the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, first used by his mother Queen Elizabeth II in 2014.\n\nThey will travel to Westminster Abbey for the coronation and then back to the palace later on Saturday.\n\nAn emotional day for many\n\nThe coronation is an emotional day for many, the royal family connecting them to their own loved ones.\n\nVicky Turnbull, an elementary school worker who travelled to the Mall in central London from the East Midlands city of Leicester with six friends, was waving a flag that her mother — who died 18 months ago — waved at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“My mum came to the queen’s coronation. She talked about it all the time. I know she would have been so proud if she was here,” she said. Turnbull also kept a promise to the children of Hallbrook School that she would display a banner bearing the school’s name.\n\nProcession viewing areas are full\n\nAll procession viewing areas along the route are full and no entry will be granted to new arrivals, Britain's Department for Culture, Media and Sport said.\n\nThe viewing areas hit their maximum capacity at around 8:30 a.m. local time (3:30 a.m. ET).\n\nThe king will begin his procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in just under 15 minutes, starting at 10:20 a.m. local time (5:20 a.m. ET).\n\nPrince Andrew booed as he leaves Buckingham Palace\n\nPrince Andrew was booed by some members of the crowd as he left Buckingham Palace for Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe Duke of York, has been tainted by allegations of sexual abuse related to his long association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his confidant, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of child sex trafficking in 2021.\n\nAllegations by Virginia Giuffre that she had been trafficked to Andrew and forced to have sex with him dogged Prince Andrew for years and, in November 2019, a high-profile BBC interview with the royal that clearly intended to push back on the claims backfired spectacularly. Soon after, he stepped back from his public duties.\n\nHead of U.K. anti-monarchy group arrested amid 'major police operation'\n\nThe head of the U.K.’s main anti-monarchy group Republic was arrested hours ahead of King Charles III's coronation amid what the officials called a \"major police operation.\"\n\nFive Republic activists, along with the group's leader Graham Smith, were arrested on Saturday morning with hundreds of placards seized, the organization said in a tweet.\n\nMeanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said on Twitter:“ A significant police operation is underway in central London,”\n\n“We have made a number of arrests in the area of Carlton House Terrace,” they added, which is just 10 minutes from Buckingham Palace. They added that the protestors were arrested on “suspicion of breaching the peace.”\n\nand\n\nOther four-legged friends have also joined the festivities, with this pup looking less pleased about the weather conditions:\n\nDon't 'startle the horses'\n\nThe thousands of royal supporters gathered on the Mall have been warned: Don’t spook the horses.\n\nA message played on the loudspeakers just before 8 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) said that hundreds of police and military horses are going to take part in the procession and that fans should not wave flags or throw anything onto the road that could “startle the horses” while they are passing.\n\n“Your cooperation is greatly appreciated, especially by the horses,” the message said.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden arrives at Westminster Abbey\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden has arrived at Westminster Abbey for the coronation ceremony.\n\nShe was wearing a periwinkle suit with matching fascinator and gloves as she entered the historic building.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is not in attendance, because no U.S. president has ever attended a British coronation, a tradition that continues today.\n\nRoyal wellwishers are braving the rain and trying their best to find a vantage point on the Mall to watch the king and queen make their way to Westminster Abbey for Britain’s first coronation in 70 years.\n\nPhoto: Champagne popping in London's Hyde Park\n\nand\n\nIt might still be morning, but some members of the public are already getting in the party mood in London’s Hyde Park ahead of the coronation.\n\nHigh fashion and finery as celebrities steal some of the spotlight\n\nand\n\nSinger Katy Perry, who will perform at the coronation concert at Windsor Castle on Sunday, is among a host of celebrities attending the coronation ceremony.\n\nOther stars in attendance include actors Emma Thompson, Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley.\n\nSingers Lionel Richie and Nick Cave were also in attendance, along with a plethora of other British TV stars and athletes.\n\nGuests arriving at Westminster Abbey\n\nGuests have already started to fill Westminster Abbey ahead of the coronation.
