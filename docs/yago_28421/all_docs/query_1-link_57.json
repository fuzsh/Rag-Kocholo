At Leopold's death in 1701, Joseph became Emperor Joseph I. His marriage produced no surviving sons, so at his death in 1711 his younger brother became Emperor Charles VI. He, too, had no sons, so he issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which provided for his posessions to be inherited by his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa; the title of Emperor would go to her husband, Francis Duke of Lorraine. Most European monarchs agreed to this, and the issue seemed settled. At his death in 1740, however, many countries contested the succession, and the War of Austrian Succession began. The office of Emperor was taken by Charles Elector of Bavaria, Joseph I's son-in-law, becoming Charles VII. Maria Theresa's Austrian forces would defeat him and take Bavaria, and after his death his son Maximilian would make peace with the Habusburgs, agreeing to support Francis Duke of Lorraine in exchange for the return of Bavaria.\n\nBoth Maria Theresa and Charles VII, enemies in war, would name a daughter Maria Antonia. They were second cousins.\n\nI hope that wasn't too complicated.\n\nCuivienen\n\nDeity\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n8,011\n\nAug 9, 2006\n\n#190\n\nIt's compounded by the fact that the deceased wife of Charles III of Spain was also a Maria Amalia, which had me confused for a while.\n\nCuivienen\n\nDeity\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n8,011\n\nAug 9, 2006\n\n#191\n\nLuckymoose said:\n\nNo I beleive you are wrong.I haven't sealed my fate as my fate is to fall.I have merely bought my self time before my enevitable defeat.Unless they uphold there Alliance.\n\nYour reforms? Haven't you heard of the fate of Selim III, overthrown by the Jannisaries because he tried to reform the military (in a much less radical way than you are doing, and later in history)?
