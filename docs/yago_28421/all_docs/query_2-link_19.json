        "text": "King Charles III and the Queen Consort are celebrating their 19th wedding anniversary. The couple, who first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970, announced their engagement in February 2005 and married on 9 April that year.\n\nRead More\n\nThe real MVP of the skinny jeans comeback? The Princess of Wales\n\nIt’s official, skinny jeans are back. And whether you’re pro or against their riotous return on the runways, Kate Middleton proves the ultimate inspiration for how style them with palace-worthy elegance\n\nThe wedding was held at Windsor Guildhall, making the future King the first member of the British Royal Family to marry in a civil ceremony. Due to the fact that both the bride and groom had previously divorced, it was deemed appropriate that the ceremony should be kept strictly legal, and the nuptials were held accordingly. Charles had previously been married to Diana, Princess of Wales from 1981 to 1996, while Camilla had been married to Andrew Parker Bowles from 1973 to 1995.\n\nCamilla did not wear a traditional choice of a tiara for the service, as the couple were not marrying in a church. Instead she opted for a white hat by designer Philip Treacy for the official ceremony and for the blessings she wore a headpiece constructed of dramatic gold feathers. The bride chose two outfits for the day, both designed by Anna Valentine and Antonia Robinson. For the service she wore a cream silk dress, followed by a pale blue chiffon gown with a long-sleeved, gold-embroidered coat over the top.\n\nRead More\n\nFelicidades! European royalty and Spanish aristocracy come together to celebrate as Teresa Urquijo, granddaughter of Princess Teresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, marries the mayor of Madrid\n\nThe Spanish, Bourbon-Two Sicilies and Bulgarian Royal Families were all in attendance at the star-studded nuptials\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh did not attend the ceremony but were present for the blessings and photographs at Windsor Castle. The official photographs were taken by Hugo Burnand, a favourite royal photographer who most recently captured a new portrait of the King and Queen Consort ahead of their coronation next month.\n\nThe rest of the immediate Royal Family were in attendance, including Charles’s sons by his first marriage, Prince William and Prince Harry, and Camilla’s children, Laura and Tom Parker Bowles. Other notable guests included Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Edward Fox, Jilly Cooper, Valentino Garavani and of course, a plethora of foreign royals.\n\nRead More\n\nLove is in the air at the Royal Ballet: meet the four ballerinas preparing to waltz down the aisle this summer\n\nFour ballerinas at the Royal Ballet are engaged, including the first soloist Meaghan Grace Hinkis. So what do they all have planned for their weddings? Tatler’s Wedding Editor Astrid Joss finds out…\n\nThe newlyweds honeymooned at Birkhall house, a royal seat Charles had inherited from his grandmother, the Queen Mother, after her death in 2002. Situated in the grounds of the Balmoral estate, the couple’s first days of married life were no doubt spent out on the windy Scottish moors and in the cosy confines of the royal residence.\n\nAt the time of their wedding in 2005, it was stated that Camilla would be styled as Princess Consort on her husband’s accession to the throne. Yet in 2022, ahead of her Platinum Jubilee, the late Queen expressed her wish for Camilla to be styled as Queen Consort, denoting her status as a fully embraced member of the royal fold. Buckingham Palace later confirmed that the ‘Consort’ title would be dropped after the coronation, with King Charles’s wife instead being titled Queen Camilla."
