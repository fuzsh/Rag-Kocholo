        "text": "Biography of Maria Ferdinanda of Saxony\n\nPrincess Maria Ferdinanda of Saxony (27 April 1796 – 3 January 1865) was born to Maximilian, Crown Prince of Saxony and his first wife Princess Caroline of Parma on 27 April 1796. She was their second oldest daughter. Her mother died in 1804, and her father remarried in 1825 Princess Maria Luisa Carlota of Parma, but this marriage would produce no new siblings. Her father died in 1838, having renounced his rights to the succession of Saxony in favor of his eldest son.\n\nMaria Ferdinanda had seven siblings, most of whom married well. Her older sister was Princess Amalie, a notable composer. Her next younger brother would become Frederick Augustus II of Saxony in 1836. Her next brother was Prince Klemens, who would die at the age of 24. Her next three siblings, Maria Anna, John, and Maria Josepha Amalia, would become by birth or marriage Grand Duchess of Tuscany, King of Saxony, and Queen of Spain respectively.\n\nIn 1817 Maria Ferdinanda accompanied her younger sister Princess Maria Anna of Saxony to Florence where she was going to marry the future Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The two were very close and Maria Anna was too frightened to go without Maria Ferdinanda's company. Leopoldo II and Maria Anna were duly married, but something decidedly unexpected occurred. Maria Ferdinanda caught the eye of Leopoldo's elderly father Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nOn 6 May 1821 Maria Ferdinanda was married to Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence. She was his second wife, and he was twenty-seven years older. She was his first cousin once removed as well as a first cousin once removed of his first wife Princess Luisa of Naples. Ferdinand may have desired this second marriage because the succession was in doubt: though his only son had recently married Maria Ferdinanda’s sister Maria Anna, he was considered sickly. No children were born of this marriage.\n\nAs Maria Ferdinanda's younger sister, Princess Maria Anna of Saxony, was married to Ferdinando's son, Leopoldo, Maria Ferdinanda thus became her own sister's step-mother-in-law.\n\nWhen Ferdinando III died in 1824 in Florence, his son Leopoldo and his, Maria Anna, succeeded as Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nIn 1859 the Tuscan royal family lost their claims to the throne during the Italian Unification. The royal family left the Palazzo Pitti in Florence for the Austrian court of Emperor Francis Joseph and Empress Elisabeth in Vienna. Maria Ferdinanda lived mainly from then on in Schlackenwerth, but was often a guest of her brother King John of Saxony in Dresden. She had an especially close relationship with her sister Amalie. Maria Ferdinanda was a bearer of the royal Order of the Noble Ladies of Maria Luisa, an order founded by Queen Maria Louisa of Spain.\n\nMaria Ferdinanda remained a widow for forty-one years, finally dying on 3 January 1865. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt, Vienna."
