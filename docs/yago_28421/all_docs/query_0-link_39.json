        "text": "The young Infante of Spain, Don Carlos, was the second son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony. He eventually took the throne as Charles IV (r. 1788-1808). While Charles was not the eldest son, he was favored due to his brother’s epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Here the Infante is dressed in sumptuous garments heavy with embroidery. In addition to the conventions typical of noble portraiture such as the column and the swag of velvet, the young Infante is surrounded by symbols of his future kingship: the crown and crest at the center of the cartouche, the scroll in his right hand, and the emblem of the Order of the Golden Fleece around his neck. Charles would turn out to be an indifferent ruler, more concerned with hunting than with affairs of state, which he left to his wife Maria Luisa, and his first minister, Manuel de Godoy.\n\nThe original design for this portrait of the Infante was created by Pietro Antonio Novelli (1729-1804), a painter and engraver active in Venice. Though Novelli devised the composition and drew the sketch, the plate was engraved by Giovanni Volpato (1735-1803), an engraver active first in Venice and then in Rome. The bottom right inscription indicates that the work was sold in Cadiz by Louis Bonnardel, a printseller who imported engravings from across Europe for export to Spain and the Americas. Bonnardel was also an agent of the Remondini workshop, under whom Volpato trained in his hometown of Bassano del Grappa. It is therefore possible that this work was created between 1762 and 1768, while Volpato and Novelli were both in Venice and before Bonnardel departed Cadiz for Marseilles.\n\n– Kathryn Santner, Frederick and Jan Mayer Fellow of Spanish Colonial Art, 2022"
