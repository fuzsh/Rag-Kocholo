        "text": "Charles III of Spain is the third surviving son of the first Bourbon King of Spain Philip V and Elisabeth Farnese. The descendants of Charles III of Spain, are numerous. Growing up in Madrid till he was 16, he was sent to the Italian Sovereign Duchy of Parma and Piacenza which, through his mother Elisabeth of Parma, was considered his birthright. Charles married only once, to the cultured Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, with whom he had 13 children; 8 of these reached adulthood (most dying young of smallpox) and only 4 of these had issue.\n\nA younger son of Charles would found the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, while his younger brother would found the House of Bourbon-Parma.[1] This article deals with the children of Charles III and in turn their senior descendants.\n\nThe future Charles III (Real Alcázar de Madrid, Madrid, Kingdom of Spain, 20 January 1716 – Royal Palace of Madrid, Madrid, Kingdom of Spain, 14 December 1788) was the King of Spain and the Spanish Indies from 1759 to his death in 1788.\n\nEldest son of Philip V of Spain and his second wife, Princess Elisabeth of Parma, he became the Duke of Parma and Piacenza under the name of Charles I (at the death of his great uncle Antonio Farnese); later on in 1734 while Duke of Parma he conquered the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and was thus created the King of Naples and Sicily due to a personal union; he ruled under the simple name of Charles with no specific numeration even though time has made him Charles VII of Naples and Charles V and Sicily. In Sicily, he was known as Charles III of Sicily and of Jerusalem; using the ordinal one III rather than V for the Sicilian people did not recognise as their sovereign legitimate one or Charles I of Naples (Charles d'Anjou), against whom they rebelled, nor the Emperor Charles, quickly discharged of the island. He was crowned King of Naples and Sicily at Palermo, Sicily on 3 July 1735.\n\nAfter becoming the King of Spain by default, he left the Neapolitan and Sicilian kingdoms to his third surviving son who was later Ferdinand IV of Naples; Ferdinand III of Sicily; Ferdinand would see the creation of the future Kingdom of the Two Sicilies which would be ruled by Charles' descendants till 1861.\n\nHe was a proponent of enlightened absolutism.\n\nFamily of Charles in 1743\n\nShe was born at the Zwinger Palace in Dresden, the daughter of Augustus III of Poland, Elector of Saxony and Maria Josepha, herself daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor. Her full name was Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga von Sachsen. One of 15 children, she was the sister of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony,\n\nIn 1737 Maria Amalia became engaged to the future Charles III of Spain. The marriage date was confirmed on 31 October 1737. In 1738, at the age of 14, Maria Amalia married Charles of Bourbon, then King of Naples and Sicily. Despite the fact that this was an arranged marriage, the couple was very close and had many children. Maria Amalia had a proxy ceremony at Dresden in May 1738 with her brother.\n\nThe couple met for the first time on 19 June 1738 at Portella.\n\nAt the end of 1758, Charles' half brother Ferdinand VI was displaying the same symptoms of depression that their father used to suffer from. Ferdinand lost his devoted wife, Infanta Barbara of Portugal in August 1758 and would fall into deep mourning for her. He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. In September 1760, a year after arriving in Madrid, Maria Amalia died from tuberculosis at the Buen Retiro Palace outside the capital. She was buried at the Royal Crypt in El Escorial. She was joined by her devoted husband in 1788.\n\nMaria Isabel Antonietta de Padua Francisca Januaria Francisca de Paula Juana Nepomucena Josefina Onesifora of Naples and Sicily was born at the Palace of Portici, Portici, Modern Italy, 6 September 1740, she died in Naples on 2 November 1742. Due to being a male line descendant of Philip V of Spain (paternal grandfather) she was an Infanta of Spain.\n\nBorn Princess Maria Josefa Antonietta of Naples and Sicily at the Palace of Portici on 20 January 1742 she later died in Naples on 1 April 1742. She was an Infanta of Spain.\n\nPrincess Maria Isabel Ana was born at the Palace of Capodimonte on 30 April 1743; the young princess died at Capodimonte on 5 March 1749 at age 5 years, 10 months. She was an Infanta of Spain.\n\nPrincess Maria Josefa Carmela was born at Gaeta in Italy on 6 July 1744; the first of the Charles' children to live past their fifth birthday, she died in Madrid on 8 December 1801; despite her long life little is known of her. She was an Infanta of Spain.\n\nMain article: Maria Luisa of Spain\n\nBorn at the Palace of Portici on 24 November 1745, she would die at the Imperial Palace of the Hofburg in Vienna, 15 May 1792 aged 46. She would marry Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and become the future Holy Roman Empress; Queen consort of the Romans, Hungary and Bohemia; Archduchess consort of Austria; Grand Duchess consort of Tuscany. Despite being born as Princess Maria Luisa of Naples and Sicily, her \"style\" changed to Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain after 1759 when her father became King of Spain. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nDescendant Portrait Birth Marriages Death Maria Luisa of Spain\n\n1745–1792 24 November 1745\n\nNaples\n\ndaughter of Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n16 February 1764\n\n15 children 15 May 1792\n\nVienna\n\naged 46 Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n1792–1835 12 February 1768\n\nFlorence\n\nson of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Infante Maria Luisa of Spain Duchess Elisabeth of Württemberg\n\n6 January 1788\n\none child\n\nMaria Theresa of Naples and Sicily\n\n15 September 1790\n\n12 children\n\nMaria Ludovika of Austria-Este\n\n6 January 1808\n\nno children\n\nCaroline Augusta of Bavaria\n\n29 October 1816\n\nno children 2 March 1835\n\nVienna\n\naged 67 Ferdinand I of Austria\n\n1835–1848 19 April 1793\n\nFlorence\n\nson of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily Maria Anna of Savoy\n\n27 February 1831\n\nno children 29 June 1875\n\nVienna\n\naged 82 Archduke Franz Karl of Austria\n\n1848–1878 17 December 1802\n\nVienna\n\nson of Francis II and Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily Princess Sophie of Bavaria\n\n4 November 1824\n\nVienna\n\n8 March 1878\n\nVienna\n\naged 75 Franz Joseph I of Austria\n\n1878–1916 18 August 1830, Schönbrunn Palace\n\nson of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and Princess Sophie of Bavaria Elisabeth of Bavaria\n\n24 April 1854\n\n4 children 21 November 1916\n\nSchönbrunn Palace\n\naged 86 Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg\n\n1916–1962 29 September 1902\n\nson of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, son of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria Countess Maria Elisabeth Bona von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee\n\n16 November 1926\n\n6 children 8 January 1962\n\naged 59 Franz, Duke of Hohenberg\n\n1962–1977 13 September 1927\n\nArtstetten Castle, Austria\n\nson of Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg and Countess Maria of Waldburg at Wolfegg and Waldsee Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg\n\n9 May 1956\n\n2 children 16 August 1977\n\naged 49 Princess Anna (Anita) of Hohenberg\n\n1977– 18 August 1958\n\nSchloss Berg, Luxembourg\n\ndaughter of Franz, Duke of Hohenberg and Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg Romée de la Poëze, Count of Harambure\n\n15 July 1978\n\n4 children\n\nCount Andreas von Bardeau\n\n9 July 2005\n\nno children\n\nPrince Felipe Antonio Genaro Pasquale Francesco de Paula of Naples and Sicily was born the first son at the Palace of Portici, 13 June 1747; titled the Duke of Calabria, he was excluded from succession to the throne due to his mental conditions; he died at the Palace of Portici, 19 September 1777 and was buried in Naples.
