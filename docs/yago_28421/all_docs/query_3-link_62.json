        "text": "Intro\n\nInfanta Maria Luisa of Spain (1745-1792) was Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, Queen of Germany, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia and Grand Duchess of Tuscany as consort of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nEarly years\n\nMaria Luisa was born in Portici, Campania, in the palace of her parents, Charles, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony, on 24 November 1745, her mother’s 21st birthday. She was the fifth daughter and the second surviving child of her parents.\n\nHer father, the future Charles III of Spain, had become king of Naples and Sicily in 1735 after the occupation by the Spanish in the War of Polish Succession. After her father became king of Spain upon the death of her great-uncle, Ferdinand VI of Spain, in 1759, she became known as Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain and moved with her family to Spain.\n\nHer parents had a total of 13 children, but only seven survived to adulthood.\n\nThe almost non-marriage\n\nOriginally Maria Luisa was supposed to marry the future Emperor Joseph II but the marriage did not take place due to the disapproval of Louis XV of France, who wanted Joseph to marry his granddaughter, Isabella of Parma, instead.\n\nOn 16 February 1764, Maria Luisa married by proxy in Madrid to Leopold, third son of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and designated heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. After the proxy marriage, she travelled to Austria via Barcelona, Genoa and Bolzano. The following year, on 5 August, she married him in person in Innsbruck.\n\nHowever, the marriage almost did not take place.\n\nLeopold fell ill on the journey to Bozen and, when the family was reunited in Innsbruck, he suffered from pleurisy. On their wedding day, Leopold struggled to breathe and sweat poured down his face as he recited his wedding vows. As soon as they were officially married, Leopold was rushed to bed.\n\nMaria Luisa received support from her new mother-in-law but both were very worried. The next day Leopold was even worse and had a strong fever. Maria Luisa joined her new in-laws in a silent vigil at his bedside. It took almost two weeks before Leopold began to improve.\n\nGrand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nA few days later, the death of Emperor Francis made Maria Luisa’s husband the new Grand Duke of Tuscany and the married couple moved to Florence, where they would live for the next twenty-five years. They arrived in Florence on 13 September 1765 and settled in the Pitti Palace.\n\nAt the time of her marriage, Maria Luisa was described as a blue-eyed beauty with a lively charm, simple and unpretentious, with a disposition to be generous and kind; it is said that her natural friendliness contrasted with Leopold’s somewhat cold nature.\n\nThanks to her strict Catholic upbringing, Maria Luisa was brought up to endure the difficulties of pregnancy and marriage without complaint, a role she performed admirably. The relationship between Maria Luisa and Leopold has been described as happy and Maria Luisa was a supportive and faithful wife. She accepted her husband’s infidelities without complaint: among his best-known mistresses were Lady Anna Gore Cowper and the ballerina Livia Raimondi.\n\nAs Grand Duchess of Tuscany, Maria Luisa made a name for herself in her first year in Florence, during the famine of 1765, when she provided the poor and needy with food and medical assistance and was held up as an ideal ‘model of female virtue’.\n\nOn 14 January 1767, Maria Luisa gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Maria Theresa after her formidable grandmother. In February of the following year she gave birth to a ‘healthy, well-formed‘ son. The child was named Francis and he too would one day become Holy Roman Emperor. His uncle and godfather Joseph would have an immense interest in his life, as he was the potential heir. It is said that Maria Theresa was so excited that she ran into the imperial theatre shouting: “My Poldy’s got a boy!”.\n\nWith the family now settled and blessed with an heir, it was time for the coronation. Maria Luisa was never crowned Grand Duchess, although she was present at Leopold’s coronation in July 1768.\n\nShe accompanied her consort and sister-in-law, Maria Carolina of Austria, to the latter’s wedding to her brother, King Ferdinand IV of Naples: the couple stayed there throughout the summer of 1768.\n\nThe following year a second son was born. His name was Ferdinand and he was to become the next Grand Duke of Tuscany. Leopold had been reigning in Tuscany for almost five years but felt suffocated by his mother’s constant advice and in April 1770 he travelled to Wien with Maria Luisa, by then pregnant again, to talk to her. Leopold and Maria Theresa talked for hours and both emerged exhausted, although the result seemed to please them both.\n\nShortly before dawn on 21 April 1770, Maria Luisa gave birth to her fourth child, a daughter named Maria Anna. The family remained in Austria for the following spring and summer, as the birth had been difficult and Maria Luisa needed time to recover.\n\nMore children were to follow, Archduke Charles was born in 1771, Alexander in 1772, Albert in 1773 and Maximilian in 1774.\n\nMaria Luisa and her consort gave their children a very free education, far removed from any formal court life, and occasionally took them on trips to the countryside and the coast. Above all, they were taught that, as royalty, they had to serve the people. Maria Luisa and Leopold disliked formal occasions and rarely attended performances or maintained court ceremonial; while Leopold devoted himself to politics and his personal pleasures, Maria Luisa isolated herself almost completely from high society and devoted herself entirely to the education of her children. She remained largely unknown to the local aristocracy and limited her private social life to a small circle of friends.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa was particularly fond of the children of Leopold and Maria Luisa and kept herself informed of the smallest details, including their height. However, her life was coming to an end and she no longer found joy in life. As she was about to die in 1780, she wrote to Leopold and Maria Luisa: ‘You are Christians and virtuous, this comforts me… God receives you. I give you both and your dear ten children my blessing‘. She died on 29 November 1780 in the arms of her son Joseph.\n\nBetween 1774 and 1780, Maria Luisa gave birth to four more children: Joseph (born 1776), Maria Clementina (born 1777), Antonio (1779) and Maria Amalia (1780).\n\nIn 1781, his brother-in-law Joseph, who had taken a special interest in her eldest son Francis as his heir, took it upon himself to find a bride for his 14-year-old nephew. He found her at the court of Württemberg: her name was Elisabeth. He wrote to Leopold: ‘She is not beautiful and will never be pretty. She is tall for her age, slender, well-formed, has pretty enough eyes, is blond, has a large mouth and possesses a sweet and alert expression‘. Her elder sister Sophie Dorothea was the wife of Catherine the Great’s son.\n\nAfter six months in which the King of Prussia tried to prevent the union, Joseph wrote to Leopold that the marriage had been decided. Leopold replied on behalf of himself and Maria Luisa: ‘We feel that our children are also yours and the state’s, and that consequently, it is for you to dispose of them in a manner that seems to you useful and advantageous to the Monarchy‘. It would however take some time before the marriage could take place.\n\nIn the meantime, Maria Luisa gave birth to four more sons, John (born 1782), Rainier (born 1783), Louis (born 1784) and finally Rudolf (born 1788). In total she had 16 children, two of whom did not survive to adulthood. Some of the children showed signs of epilepsy, but Leopold and Maria Luisa kept this secret because it could be a hereditary disease.\n\nIn 1784, Francis and Leopold travelled to Wien, where Francis was to receive further education. They arrived at the end of June and on 1 July Franz met his future wife, Elisabeth, who had been living in Wien for two years. Apparently, it was love at first sight.\n\nOn 6 January 1788, Francis and Elisabeth were finally married. The wedding was attended by only a few close relatives. Leopold and Maria Luisa were unable to attend. Maria Theresa, Francis’s older sister, was also married that year. She had fallen in love with Prince Antony of Saxony and Leopold considered it a suitable marriage. He had little prospect of ruling Saxony, which suited the quiet Maria Theresa just fine. Many years later they would become King and Queen of Saxony.\n\nHoly Roman Empress\n\nMeanwhile, the health of Leopold’s brother Joseph was rapidly deteriorating. He begged Leopold to go to Wien and Leopold promised to join him as soon as business in Florence was settled. But Leopold himself was not at all well, being afflicted with a terrible flu.\n\nIn the end, it was his nephew Francis who assisted the dying Emperor. Joseph gave him a diamond-studded dagger as a remembrance of him. During the last week of Joseph’s life, Francis’ wife Elisabeth went into labour and gave birth to a daughter, whom Joseph named Ludovica. The birth was extremely difficult and forceps had to be used. Elisabeth seemed to recover but died suddenly in the middle of the night on 18 February 1790 of haemorrhaging. Joseph burst into tears when he was informed and cried: “Throw me on top of her!” Maria Luisa’s first grandchild would live only one year.\n\nJust two days after Elisabeth’s death, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, died. Five days later, news reached Florence that Leopold was now King of Hungary and Bohemia and presumed Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He was elected Holy Roman Emperor the following September.\n\nTaking the name Leopold II, the new emperor moved the family to Wien, where Maria Luisa assumed the role of imperial consort, the penultimate Holy Roman Empress.\n\nOne of Leopold’s first tasks was to find a new wife for Francis. He chose Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily, Francis’ double first cousin and daughter of his sister Maria Carolina. Two more marriages were arranged between their families. Their son Ferdinand would marry Maria Theresa’s sister, Luisa, and their daughter Maria Clementina would marry Maria Theresa’s brother, the future King Francis I of the Two Sicilies.\n\nAt the end of September came the news that Leopold had been elected Holy Roman Emperor and his and Maria Luisa’s coronation took place on 9 October in Frankfurt. The coronation as King of Hungary followed in November. His son Alexander was appointed Palatine of Hungary. His son Ferdinand was appointed the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, while his eldest son Francis became Regent in Wien while Leopold travelled around his Empire.\n\nEpilogue\n\nLeopold and Maria Luisa would not reign for long. At the end of February 1792, only two years after his coronation, Leopold began to suffer excruciating stomach pains and vomited frequently. On 1 March 1792, Leopold died in the arms of his devoted wife Maria Luisa.\n\nMaria Luisa was devastated and would follow her husband to the grave only two months later. She died on 15 May 1792 after declaring that ‘she could not survive [without] the husband she had always loved passionately‘. She was only 46 years old.\n\nShe was buried next to her husband in the Capuchin Crypt. Her urn is in the Loreto Chapel of the Augustinerkirche in Wien, her entrails in the Ducal Crypt."
