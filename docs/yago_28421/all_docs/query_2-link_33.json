        "text": "King Charles and Queen Camilla married on April 9, 2005, decades after meeting.\n\nThe pair, who battled media and public scrutiny after it was revealed they had an affair during Charles' marriage to Diana, wed in a civil ceremony near Windsor Castle (but outside royal grounds).\n\nThe ceremony was intimate, with only 28 guests, including the King's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and Camilla's children from her marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles, Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes.\n\nCharles' parents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, did not attend the wedding ceremony itself: As head of the Church of England, the Queen ultimately decided that it was not appropriate for her to be at the wedding of two people who had each divorced their previous partners. However, they were present for the Service of Prayer and Dedication at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle afterward and held a reception for the couple in Windsor Castle and hosted a reception for the newlyweds.\n\nIn the years since their wedding, Charles and Camilla have celebrated many milestones together, including the marriages of their children, the births of their grandchildren and, most notably, their coronation ceremony in 2023.\n\n\"It is hard to believe how quickly time has flown by...,\" Camilla wrote to a royal fan who wished her and Charles a happy 18th anniversary in April 2023.\n\nTheir 2005 wedding ceremony was also featured in the sixth and final season of Netflix's The Crown.\n\nFrom Camilla's two bridal looks to their guest list, here's a look back at King Charles and Queen Camilla's wedding in 2005.\n\nThey got married in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall\n\nAfter announcing their engagement in February 2005, Charles and Camilla wed two months later on April 9. They held their nuptials at Windsor Guildhall, right outside of Windsor Castle, and opted for a civil ceremony since they both were divorced.\n\nFollowing the civil ceremony, the newlyweds then made their way to St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for a religious blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams.\n\nUnlike most royal brides, Camilla did not wear a tiara\n\nAlthough Camilla wore two bridal looks on her wedding day, neither included a tiara. Instead, Camilla wore hats — two, in fact.\n\nFor the wedding itself, Camilla paired a wide-brimmed, feather-accented hat by Phillip Treacy with a white silk chiffon dress and matching coat. She then changed into a floor-length embroidered blue-and-gold coat over a blue chiffon gown and accessorized with a gold feather headpiece also by Treacy.\n\nThey hired a favorite royal wedding photographer to take photos\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Charles and Camilla hired photographer Hugo Burnand to take their wedding photos. His name might sound familiar, as Burnand is most often the person behind the camera at a number of important royal events.\n\nIn addition to their wedding, Burnand also photographed Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011 and King Charles’ coronation in 2023.\n\nQueen Elizabeth did not attend the wedding\n\nMost notably, Queen Elizabeth was not present for Charles and Camilla’s wedding. The groom's father, Prince Philip, also did not attend the civil wedding ceremony.\n\nTheir absence came down to one detail: religion. As the head of the Church of England, the Queen felt it was not appropriate for her to attend the civil wedding of two people who had previously been divorced. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made their support for Charles and Camilla known after the civil ceremony when they attended the pair’s religious blessing at St. George’s Chapel and hosted a reception at Windsor Castle.\n\nQueen Elizabeth also made it clear before her death that Charles and Camilla had her full support when she announced her wish for Camilla to be known as Camilla, Queen Consort when her son ascended the throne.\n\nShe made the statement when celebrating the 70th anniversary of her ascension in February 2022 — marking the first time she publically backed the couple. “When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me. And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service,\" she said.\n\nPrince William had a role in the wedding\n\nOnly 28 people were on hand to witness the first part of the wedding day at Windsor Guildhall, including Charles and Camilla’s children. Charles’ son Prince William and Camilla’s son Tom both served as witnesses on the big day.\n\nCharles' siblings, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, were also there to watch him and Camilla tie the knot."
