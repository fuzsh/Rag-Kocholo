        "text": "Here's who was there — and who missed the King's big day\n\nThe coronation ceremony was the hottest ticket in town, with scores of foreign dignitaries, British officials, celebrities and faith leaders gathered in the Westminster Abbey.\n\nStill, the congregation, while including some 2,300 people, was much smaller than it was in 1953 when temporary structures had to be erected within the abbey to accommodate the more than 8,000 people who attended.\n\nHere’s who was there:\n\nThe guest list was a Who’s Who of British public life and politics: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was there, as were all of his living predecessors: Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan, UK opposition leader Keir Starmer, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt and numerous other ministers and politicians were also in attendance.\n\nAs expected, the British royal royal family put on a strong showing. All of the King’s siblings were there, as were his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. William was accompanied by Catherine, Princess of Wales, along with their children – George, Charlotte and Louis. Numerous other members of the family sat in the front rows at the abbey, witnessing the ceremony first hand.\n\nAbout 100 heads of states from around the world traveled to London for the occasion. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel all attended the service, as did French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nDozens of members of foreign royal families also came. Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, as well as Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene of Monaco, the King and Queen of Jordan, Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein and Rania Al Abdullah and Japan’s Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko of Japan.\n\nMany celebrities also made an appearance, including US singers Lionel Richie and Katy Perry, Australian musician Nick Cave, actresses Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, Joanna Lumley and Judi Dench, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and broadcaster Stephen Fry.\n\nThe list was impressive, but there were also some notable absences:\n\nUS President Joe Biden did not travel to London. Instead US first lady Jill Biden led the American delegation.\n\nBiden sat next to Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska. Her husband, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, was not attending.\n\nWhile Prince Harry, the King’s younger son, travelled to the UK from the US, his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stayed home with their two young children.\n\nThe leaders of Russia, Belarus, Iran, Myanmar, Syria, Afghanistan and Venezuela were not in attendance because they were not invited, according to Reuters.\n\nWith the pomp of Saturday's ceremony now past, what is the monarchy's relevance in modern-day Britain?\n\nIn the London of 1953 — the year of Britain’s last coronation, for Queen Elizabeth II — archival CNN footage shows a country that was smaller, almost entirely White, Christian and full of post-war joie de vivre.\n\nCut to present day, and King Charles’ coronation took place Saturday with both a United Kingdom and greater Commonwealth that looks entirely different from when his mother ascended the throne.\n\nCNN’s Bianca Nobilo took a trip around London before the ceremony to consider the relevance of the monarchy today.\n\nWatch her report below:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\ne1dd6ecf-dad3-4504-830e-49a1a832ec42.mp4\n\n02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nHighlights from King Charles III's once-in-a-generation coronation\n\nA historic gospel choir performance, a scaled-back flypast and a controversial invitation for public participation: Saturday’s coronation of King Charles III was filled with notable moments.\n\nIf you’re just now catching up, here are other highlights from the once-in-a-generation royal event:\n\nThe procession: The rainy day kicked off when King Charles III and Queen Camilla travelled from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. In a slight deviation from tradition, the couple rode in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. They were accompanied on the 1.3-mile route by the sovereign’s most trusted bodyguards, the Household Cavalry, and were greeted by cheering and waving crowds.\n\nThe service: The intricate service lasted just over two hours – about an hour shorter than Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 – and followed a traditional template. However, it has been modernized in certain key ways: The archbishop acknowledged the multiple faiths observed in the UK during the ceremony. And when the King took the Coronation Oath, he became the first monarch to pray aloud at his coronation.\n\nThe King was then anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was also presented with coronation regalia.\n\nThen, for the first time in coronation history, the archbishop invited the British public and those from “other Realms” to recite a pledge of allegiance to the newly crowned monarch and his “heirs and successors.” (When those plans were unveiled, it caused some controversy around the country — and the Church of England changed the wording of its invitation following the response.)\n\nThe ceremony also included a reading from the Bible by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and, in another coronation first, gospel music.\n\nOnce the King was crowned, his wife, Queen Camilla, was crowned in her own, shorter ceremony with Queen Mary’s Crown.\n\nThe flypast: The Royal Air Force’s famous Red Arrows flew over a rainy Buckingham Palace, ending a brief and slimmed down display. The national anthem was played, and Charles and Camilla gave a few waves from Buckingham Palace to the crowd before going inside, then making a balcony encore.\n\nThe guests: The coronation ceremony was the hottest ticket in town, with scores of foreign dignitaries, British officials, celebrities and faith leaders gathered in the Westminster Abbey. Still, the congregation, while including some 2,300 people, was much smaller than it was in 1953 when temporary structures had to be erected within the abbey to accommodate the more than 8,000 people who attended.\n\nCelebrations: On Sunday, thousands of events and street parties are expected to take place across the country as part of the “Coronation Big Lunch.” And on Sunday evening, Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Take That will headline the “Coronation Concert” at Windsor Castle. Britons will then enjoy an extra day off on Monday.\n\nProtests: Police said they arrested more than 50 people during the coronation, after controversially promising a “robust” approach to protesters. Nonprofit Human Rights Watch said the arrests were “something you would expect to see in Moscow not London.”\n\nWatch a 3-minute recap of the day’s festivities here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nb4eb66de-96c2-40a5-982b-3c1b0c54ca06.mp4\n\n03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom hats and jewels to traditional garb, here's what guests wore for Coronation Day\n\nMuch has been made of the departures from tradition for the coronation of King Charles III — and this extended to the guest’s dress codes. Gone were the requests for attendees to wear grand robes or ceremonial attire in favor of a more relaxed, pared-down look.\n\nUS first lady Jill Biden wore a periwinkle blue Ralph Lauren skirt suit, accessorized with a coordinating hair bow. She was accompanied by her granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, in a chic pale yellow cape dress by Markarian — in what could be seen as a sartorial nod to show solidarity with Ukraine. Inside the Abbey, the pair was seated next to Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska in an icy blue dress and coat pairing.\n\nFrench luxury fashion house Dior said on Twitter that it was “honored to have dressed Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, for the coronation of King Charles III in a custom design by Kim Jones.”\n\nElsewhere, Australian musician Nick Cave looked chic in a classic three-piece black suit and Gucci horsebit loafers. Katy Perry (scheduled to headline the coronation concert in Windsor on Sunday) opted for a pink skirt suit and pearl choker by Vivienne Westwood — the late British designer who died in December 2022.\n\nThe distinctive necklace design may also be a nod to Queen Camilla’s own fashion legacy. Camilla has numerous three-strand pearl pieces, including the aquamarine piece she has worn consistently since the 1990s.\n\nAcross the event, international royalty used the moment to celebrate their country’s traditional garments. Crown Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko of Japan appeared in a morning suit and muted patterned silk kimono with an obi belt, respectively.\n\nThe theme of traditional dress was continued by King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema of Bhutan. King Jigme Khesar wore a Bhutanese Gho, while Queen Jetsun Pema wore a lilac-colored kira — a customary wrap dress typical in Bhutan.\n\nSee more looks here.\n\nWho were Charles I and II? A look at their sometimes-turbulent reigns\n\nKing Charles III has been crowned in a coronation ceremony on Saturday.\n\nIt got us wondering: Who were the other two “Charleses” who’ve served as king? Well, they didn’t exactly have the calmest reigns. Here’s what we found:\n\nCharles I: According to the British Royal Family’s website, the first Charles to ascend the throne did so in 1625. His reign, which ended in his beheading in 1649, was rather tumultuous.\n\nCharles, a patron of the arts, also had “a stubborn belief that kings are intended by God to rule,” according to Encyclopedia Brittanica.\n\nHe oversaw what became the English Civil Wars and married a Roman Catholic, with financial issues leading to tensions with Parliament. He ended up dismissing Parliament in its entirety in 1629 and ruled without it for 11 years.\n\nTwenty years later, the army decided he must be put on trial and executed. Charles was charged with treason, but did not recognize the legality of the High Court. On the scaffolding where his execution took place, Charles called himself “a martyr of the people.”\n\nHe was not buried at Westminster Abbey, but at Windsor, “to avoid public disorder,” according to the Royal Family site.\n\nCharles II: After the death of his father, Charles was invited to Scotland and proclaimed king. He fled to France when the Scots were defeated by English forces in 1651. After England and Scotland were united again, he was invited back to London to sit on the throne.\n\nKnown as the “Merry Monarch,” Charles was “tall, handsome, sharp of mind, impeccably attired and charming,” according to Royal Museums Greenwich.\n\nHe married Portugal’s Catherine of Braganza, but the two spoke no common language and he continued to carry on affairs with a variety of mistresses, fathering at least 14 illegitimate children.\n\nThe devastating Great Fire of London in 1666 — which took out most of the city — and the Great Plague of London from 1665 to 1666 — in which at least 68,000 people succumbed to bubonic plague — occurred during his rule.\n\nHis later reign was “taken up mainly with attempts to settle religious dissension,” according to the Royal Family site.\n\nHe died of a stroke in 1685 and had no legitimate heirs.\n\nBut wait — there is more! Here's what else is happening this weekend\n\nWhile the coronation weekend’s main event might be over, the celebrations continue.\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of events and street parties are expected to take place across the country as part of the “Coronation Big Lunch.”\n\nOn Sunday evening, Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Take That will headline the “Coronation Concert” at Windsor Castle. Ten locations around Britain will also be lit up with light displays, lasers and drones that evening.\n\nBritons will then enjoy an extra day off on Monday, topping off the long weekend. The public has been encouraged to use the extra holiday to volunteer in their communities.\n\nWho's who in the royal family? Catch up with our interactive family tree\n\nWith four children, eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren, the late Queen Elizabeth II’s family appeared at events, on the Buckingham Palace balcony and in many official photographs, but rarely all together in public.\n\nKing Charles III’s coronation today offered one of our best chances to see the many royal family members assembled.\n\nThe King’s two direct heirs, his son Prince William and grandson Prince George, both played official roles in the service.\n\nPrince William swore fealty to his father, while 9-year-old Prince George was one of eight boys chosen to “attend Their Majesties during the Coronation Service,” the palace said.\n\nTrying to keep all the royals straight after today’s festivities?

CNN anchors discuss\n\nCNN anchors have been discussing the appearances of Princes Andrew and Harry on coronation day.\n\nHarry was seen getting into a car on his own following the conclusion of the service at Westminster Abbey.\n\n“I think this is a soap opera part of this whole royal story,” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said.\n\nWhile the traditional role of the royal family has been “trying to unite a country,” she said, the breaks of Andrew and Harry have been notable.\n\nBoth are non-working royals, and they did not have ceremonial duties during the coronation.\n\nKey background: Harry stepped down as a working member of the royals in 2021, and the coronation marks the first time he’s been seen publicly with family members since the release of his memoir, “Spare.” The King’s youngest son returned to London without his wife, Meghan, and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. They are back in California as it is also Archie’s 4th birthday.\n\nIn 2022, Andrew was stripped of his military titles and charities, Buckingham Palace announced, after a judge ruled a sexual abuse civil lawsuit against him could proceed.\n\nA New York judge ruled against a motion by Andrew’s legal team to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with the prince when she was 17. Andrew vigorously denied those claims.\n\nA month later, he reached a deal with Giuffre to settle the lawsuit against him.\n\nWATCH HERE FOR MORE:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n3d3b178c-8806-4ea4-9b64-f757c76a72ed.mp4\n\n02:15 - Source: CNN\n\nHere's who is joining King Charles III on the Buckingham Palace balcony – and who isn't\n\nKing Charles and Camilla have emerged on the Buckingham Palace balcony to greet the crowds lining the Mall.\n\nThe King and Queen have been joined on the balcony by other working royals including Charles’ siblings, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie and Princess Anne.\n\nWilliam and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, were also present, along with their children – George, Charlotte and Louis.\n\nPrince Harry was not there, however – he appears to have parted from the family after the ceremony. Prince Andrew is also not present on the balcony.\n\nPrince Harry is absent from the Buckingham Palace balcony\n\nPrince Harry has not appeared with members of the royal family to greet the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nCNN understands that Prince Harry did not receive an invitation to join the family for this moment.\n\nCharles and Camilla step out on Buckingham Palace balcony\n\nKing Charles III and Camilla have stepped out onto the Buckingham Palace balcony, in one of the most eagerly anticipated moments of the day.\n\nA throng of flag-waving royalists cheered as they emerged from inside the Palace, ready to watch a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force.\n\nThe first-recorded royal balcony appearance was in 1851, when Queen Victoria greeted supporters during celebrations to mark the opening of the Great Exhibition.\n\nSince then it has become a flagship part of royal events, with pictures usually appearing on front pages the next day.\n\nRoyal salute and three cheers for the King after procession\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla received a Royal Salute and three cheers from military personnel as they returned to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe national anthem then again rang out in the Buckingham Palace garden.\n\nIt follows a lengthy and vast procession from the Abbey that featured 4,000 people and 19 military bands.\n\nCamilla has a divisive history. What do we know about Britain's new Queen?\n\nCamilla was crowned as Britain’s new Queen at Westminster Abbey, taking on a new and more prominent role alongside King Charles III.\n\nShe was ever-present at Charles’ side as he publicly grieved his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and stepped into his new role. She is the love of his life, as well as a decades-long counselor and confidante.\n\nSince she and Charles married in 2005, Camilla has worked hard as a senior royal, supporting her husband and championing charities helping women and children. But some in Britain find it hard to forget, or forgive, the couple’s long-running extra-marital affair and the pain it caused Charles’ first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nStill, with her common touch and ability to dissipate the tension in a room, Camilla quickly became an asset to the royal family and the British government after she married Charles in 2005.\n\nShe defined her own royal role, championing causes close to her heart, such as children’s literacy, supporting victims of domestic violence and raising awareness around osteoporosis, a condition that affected her mother and grandmother.\n\nAs well as these responsibilities, Camilla has also become a “professional grandmother,” as one of her aides told CNN in 2013.\n\nSo, what can we expect from Britain’s new Queen? You can find out here.\n\nFor some Britons, the best place to watch the coronation is the pub\n\nThe atmosphere was festive and full of joy as punters in the Phoenix pub in Chelsea watched King Charles’ coronation on TV Saturday.\n\nThe room was abuzz with excitement as drinkers watched the new monarch’s big moment.\n\nAs St. Edward’s Crown was placed on the sovereign’s head, there were a few cheers of “God Save the King.”\n\nNo one at the Chelsea establishment joined in on one controversial new element of the ritual – the homage of the people – by pledging allegiance to the King.\n\nCrowds cheer and wave as the King and Queen pass\n\nThis procession is the moment that many royal supporters have waited all day for – the King and Queen, followed by a huge parade of soldiers, musicians and horses, are passing by cheering crowds on their way to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Gold State Coach that carries the monarch and his wife is incredibly heavy – weighing 4 tons – meaning that it can only travel at walking pace.\n\nAhead of the celebrations, Sally Goodsir, the Royal Collection Trust’s curator of decorative arts, said: “It is nearly four meters tall. It’s over seven meters long. It weighs four tons. Because of that it can only be used at a walking pace, which really adds to the majesty and stateliness of this great royal procession.”\n\n“There are very few monarchies which have retained coaches working of this age, and therefore it’s an incredibly special thing to see,” she added.\n\nIt’s covered in painted panels “that exemplify” what George III, who was monarch when the coach was built in 1762, believed he would bring to the nation. “Protecting the arts such as architecture and sculpture; protecting peace in this nation, there’s figures of Mars and Minerva, the classical gods of war, but they’re not at war, they’re actually holding the British Crown aloft. So, there’s lots of messages and symbolism,” Goodsir said.\n\nSome Brits are questioning spending money on a glitzy coronation\n\nWhile many royal fans are lining the streets of London and millions more are watching the coronation at home, some Brits are questioning spending money on such an opulent event as the cost of living crisis continues to grip the country.\n\nStubbornly high inflation, years of wage stagnation and the sudden and steep rise in energy prices have left millions of Brits on the brink of poverty. Yet at the same time, the UK government is getting ready to spend tens of millions of taxpayers’ money on a glitzy event celebrating one very, very rich man: King Charles III.\n\nCNN visited Doncaster which, like many parts of Northern England, has never quite recovered from the industrial decline and mine closures of the 1980s and 90s. Already struggling, the region has been hit hard by the severe cost of living crisis that is now impacting the whole of the UK.\n\nThe government has refused to put a figure on the cost of the coronation, with estimates by British media ranging from £50 million to more than £100 million ($63 million to $125 million).\n\nAcross the country, meanwhile, real wages including bonuses fell 3% in the three months to February, according to the Office for National Statistics. That’s one of the largest falls since records began in 2001.\n\nIt’s a contrast which hasn’t been lost on these Brits.\n\nThe gloomy weather is putting the flypast at risk\n\nA scheduled flypast over Buckingham Palace to celebrate the King’s coronation could be scaled back or cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nA final decision is expected to be made at 2 p.m (9 a.m. ET), a half-hour before the flypast is scheduled to happen.\n\nThe flypast is meant to last six minutes and feature more than 60 aircraft divided into 14 waves from across the Navy, Army and Royal Air force.\n\nRoyal Air Force air chief marshal Sir Michael Wigston Friday said it’s “50/50” as to whether the event will go ahead.\n\nThe national anthem rings out around Westminster Abbey to end a historic service\n\n“God Save the King” is being sung for Charles III for the first time since his crowning, as Britain’s first coronation service in seven decades moves towards its conclusion.\n\nIt’s the same arrangement of the anthem that was sung for Charles’ mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at her coronation in 1953.\n\nNext, the procession of the King and Queen will begin.\n\nThe King and Queen receive Holy Communion\n\nHoly Communion, or the taking of consecrated bread and wine, is an act of worship integral to Christianity — the “ultimate act of remembering Jesus,” as the Church of England says in its official liturgy.\n\nThe King acknowledges the gifts of bread and wine as they are taken to the High Altar before the Archbishop of Canterbury says two prayers – the Prayer Over the Gifts and the Eucharistic Prayer.\n\nThe first of these was used at Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation and found in the Liber Regalis (The King’s Book), one of the oldest and most important sources for the coronation service. The second draws from many different sources.\n\nThe beginning of the Eucharistic Prayer echoes words used at the Queen’s 1953 coronation and adds words from the Bible. The prayer’s central section draws from Jesus’ words when he served bread and wine to his disciples at the Last Supper before he died, according to the liturgy.\n\nThen, Sanctus is sung. The text dates from the fifth century and possibly earlier. It’s set to music is a new commission for this service by the British composer Roxanna Panufnik.\n\nThe Eucharistic Prayer continues, followed by the Lord’s Prayer. The King and Queen receive Holy Communion as the choir sings the Agnus Dei, another traditional text for the mass, set to new music by Tarik O’Regan.\n\nFanfare rings out as Charles III is crowned as King\n\nGun salutes are being fired from 13 locations across the UK including Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, and on deployed Royal Navy ships, as King Charles III is crowned.\n\nThe largest, a 62-round salute, is happening from the Tower of London. A six-gun salute is underway at Horse Guards Parade and 21 rounds are being fired at the remaining locations.\n\nThe bells of Westminster Abbey are ringing out to celebrate the historic moment.\n\nThe most sacred part of the service is happening now – out of sight\n\nThe third and most sacred phase of the service, the anointing, is underway.\n\nIt began with the King and Queen kneeling at the Chairs of Estate, as the choir sang in English, Welsh, Gaelic, and Irish. The Archbishop of Canterbury led a short prayer.\n\nNow, the most dramatic part of the ceremony is starting. It is the only section that is taking place away from the crowds, cameras and sharp-eyed photographers.\n\nWhat’s happening: The Dean of Westminster pours holy oil from the Ampulla, a gold eagle-shaped flask, on to the Coronation Spoon, and then the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints Charles on his head, breast and hands, according to the Church of England’s liturgy.\n\nThe 12th-century, silver-gilt spoon is the oldest object used in coronations, having survived the obliteration of royal regalia during the English Civil War. By contrast, the Ampulla was most likely melted down. A new one was created for King Charles II’s coronation in 1661, following the restoration of the monarchy the year before.\n\nThe anointing takes place behind a three-sided screen, hidden from view while Charles is seated on the Coronation Chair.\n\nIn the background, the Choir of Westminster Abbey sings the anthem “Zadok the Priest” by George Frideric Handel, which was composed for the coronation of King George II in 1727 and performed at every British coronation since.\n\nA gospel choir has never sung at a coronation – until now\n\nSarah Mullally, Dean of His Majesty’s Chapels Royal, has read the Gospel.\n\nThe reading is bookended by a two-part composition by the prolific British composer Debbie Wiseman – best-known for her TV and film work – called “Alleluia (O Clap your Hands)” and “Alleluia (O Sing Praises).”\n\nThe second part of the work is sung by the Ascension Choir, and it’s another first – the first time that a gospel choir has sung at a coronation.\n\nRishi Sunak reads a Bible passage\n\nRishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, is conducting a reading from the Bible.\n\nIt comes from the Epistle to the Colossians:\n\nCharles has taken the Coronation Oath. Here's what it says\n\nAfter the Recognition, the king was presented the Coronation Bible and took the Coronation Oath.\n\nThe Bible was presented by Iain Greenshields, moderator of the general assembly for the Church of Scotland, who sets the words of God – the Bible – as the “royal law” to govern with.\n\nThe presentation of the Bible dates back to the joint coronation of William III and Mary II in 1689, with the involvement of the moderator beginning in 1953, according to the Church of England’s liturgy.\n\nBefore taking the Oath, Charles consented to its conditions, including fostering “an environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.” This addition to the service reflects the words of the late Queen, when she said the role of the church “is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions,” but instead has a “duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country.”\n\nThen, Charles placed his hands on the Bible and promised to abide by the Oath as administered by the archbishop, swearing to govern the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Commonwealth, while maintaining the laws of God.\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury begins service\n\nJustin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has begun the service.\n\n“Dearly beloved, we are gathered to offer worship and praise to Almighty God; to celebrate the life of our nations; to pray for Charles, our King; to recognize and to give thanks for his life of service to this Nation, the Realms, and the Commonwealth; and to witness with joy his anointing and crowning, his being set apart and consecrated for the service of his people,” Welby said.\n\n“Let us dedicate ourselves alike, in body, mind, and spirit, to a renewed faith, a joyful hope, and a commitment to serve one another in love.”\n\nHis introduction was followed by a rendition of “Kyrie eleison” – the first time a Welsh-language piece of music has been performed at a coronation.\n\nWilliam and Kate follow King Charles into the Abbey\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, have entered Westminster Abbey, following behind the King’s procession – which is a slight deviation from the order of service.\n\nWilliam and Kate’s eldest child, Prince George is not walking with them. That is because he’s with the other pages of honor who will be attending King Charles and Queen Camilla throughout the service. There are eight pages of honor in all, four for the King and four for the Queen.\n\nKing Charles arrives at Westminster Abbey for his coronation\n\nThe King and Queen have arrived at Westminster Abbey, with the start of the historic coronation ceremony just moments away.\n\nSenior royals arrive at the Abbey, moments before King Charles III\n\nAs King Charles nears Westminster Abbey, several senior members of the royal family have entered the venue.\n\nHis siblings – Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew – have all taken their seats.\n\nEarlier Queen Camilla’s family arrived at the Abbey, including her former husband Andrew Parker-Bowles and her daughter Laura Lopes and son Tom Parker-Bowles.\n\nPrince Harry enters Westminster Abbey\n\nPrince Harry has arrived at the ceremony, among the first group of royals to enter the Abbey.\n\nHarry is attending without his wife, Meghan, and their children, who have remained in the US.\n\nVeterans, health workers and royal supporters cheer elaborate procession through London\n\nThe procession, which is underway through the streets of central London, should take 33 minutes.\n\nA total of 200 personnel and horses are involved in the King’s outward procession. Along the processional route, military veterans, NHS workers and others are occupying specially-built viewing stands in Trafalgar Square, at The Mall and in front of Buckingham Palace.\n\nFans brave the rain to cheer on the King\n\nAs the rain drizzles down outside Buckingham Palace, the royal fans have come prepared for the “typical British weather.”\n\n“There’s just a lovely atmosphere – even if it is raining,” says Anita Brook, 50, holding her Union Jack umbrella.\n\n“Our first royal event was for the Silver Jubilee in 1977 – I remember the street parties and just fell in love with it. My mum is a massive royalist so we just always loved the royal family – we grew up with this.”\n\nBrook travelled to Buckingham Palace with her friend Kashmir Carmichael, 50, from Oxfordshire, in central England.\n\nWearing a Union Jack poncho, Carmichael remembers when the late Queen Elizabeth visited her school as a child.\n\n“When the Queen came to our school we were so excited. Since she has passed, our favourite royals have to be William and Kate. We haven’t missed a royal event since their wedding.”\n\nA Commonwealth procession is underway. Here's King Charles' role in the association\n\nThe Governors-General and Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth realms – or the dignitaries sent in their place – have entered the Abbey in a procession before the ceremony begins.\n\nSome history: The British Empire was at its greatest height by the end of the 19th century. However, the 20th century saw the country’s supremacy crumble as its colonies struggled and gained independence. Today, King Charles III is the head of a significantly shrunken empire, which over time transitioned into the “British Commonwealth.”\n\nHowever, the hold of the sovereign over the British Commonwealth also loosened over time.\n\nEarlier, the Commonwealth required allegiance to the Crown. But in 1949, “British” was dropped from the name.\n\nAnd today, the Commonwealth of Nations is an association of sovereign states that focus efforts on trade, international cooperation, social issues and environmental concerns.\n\nThe position of its head is not hereditary. King Charles III was selected to be the head by the member nations in 2018.\n\nMost of the member nations in this association don’t recognize the British monarch as their head of state — Barbados was the most recent country that removed the Queen as its head of state, 55 years after it declared independence from Britain.\n\nOther Caribbean countries, such as Jamaica, have indicated they intend to do the same.\n\nAdditionally, while the group largely has erstwhile British colonies, some members of the Commonwealth today were never part of the Empire. For example, Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively. Gabon and Togo joined most recently in June 2022.\n\nIn addition to the UK, King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries — or realms — including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\n\nWith the British Empire virtually gone and the Commonwealth of Nations in its new era, some are asking how relevant the body still is, given its roots in Empire.\n\nUltimately, King Charles III ascends the throne in an era where the role of the British monarch looks dramatically different from the time when his mother Queen Elizabeth II was crowned.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak enters the Abbey along with all his living predecessors\n\nBritain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has entered Westminster Abbey, moments after all of the UK’s living former premiers arrived.\n\nTony Blair, Gordon Brown, John Major and David Cameron all entered the Abbey first. They were quickly joined by Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss – who led the country for a few, chaotic weeks last year.\n\nEarlier, French President Emmanuel Macron entered the venue. European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel have also arrived, as has Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.\n\nCoronation mishaps King Charles III will want to avoid\n\nArson. Bumbling bishops. A jilted spouse banging on the abbey door.\n\nCompared to these moments that have punctuated British coronations throughout history, the British weather potentially raining on King Charles III’s parade is nothing at all.\n\nCoronations at Westminster Abbey go back almost a thousand years. They have become a well-rehearsed, finely tuned machine. Yet, despite all the pomp and ceremony, there have been times when they have gone disastrously wrong.\n\nWhen William the Conqueror was crowned on Christmas Day 1066, the atmosphere both inside and outside the abbey was tense, coming just months after William had earned his conqueror moniker by vanquishing Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.\n\nWhen those inside the abbey enthusiastically proclaimed “God save the King,” the noise reached such a level that William’s guards outside believed an assassination attempt must be underway. They then proceeded to take the only rational course of action - promptly burning down a number of buildings in the local area.\n\nGeorge IV’s coronation in 1821 featured drama that would make the writers of most soap operas blush. The King had decided to exclude his wife, Queen Caroline, from the service and ordered those guarding the entrances to Westminster Abbey to refuse her entry.\n\nDespite trying every entrance to the Abbey, she was not able to make it inside and had to leave.\n\nDuring Queen Victoria’s 1837 coronation, the young monarch was left in agony when the Archbishop of Canterbury forced the coronation ring onto the wrong finger. She also had to be rushed back into the abbey because the Bishop of Bath and Wells had accidentally omitted the section of the service in which she officially became Queen.\n\nRemarkably, there are even more coronation blunders and you can read the full story here.\n\nThis could be the warmest and wettest coronation in over a century\n\nCoronation Day is here and festivities are already off to a damp start thanks to showers that moved through London on Friday, with even more rain expected for the big day.\n\n“A further area of rain is expected to move into southwest England early on Saturday, moving east and north through the day with some heavy bursts at times. This is likely to bring some rain to London by around lunchtime,” said UK Met Office deputy chief forecaster, Steven Keates.\n\nOne bit of good news: Temperatures will be at or slightly above normal for early May.\n\nThe high temperature for Saturday in London was initially predicted to be between 16-18°C (60-64°F). By Saturday, the UK Weather office has also downgraded expected temperatures to between 12-14°C (53-57°F). For the coronation of George V, temperatures reached 17°C (63°F) back on June 22, 1911.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s also possible this could be one of the soggiest coronations in more than a century. For the coronation of George VI, zero sunshine hours were reported on May 12, 1937 along with 8 millimeters (0.32 inches) of rain.\n\nWhile it is not forecast to be a complete washout for Charles’ coronation on Saturday, the highest rain chances do happen to coincide with several outdoor scheduled activities.\n\nRain chances will start off low in the morning, but are expected to peak midday, while the King and Queen Consort are in Westminster Abbey, as well as when they are heading to the Buckingham Palace, showers are likely to salute them the entire way.\n\nWith celebrations continuing through the Bank Holiday, Sunday will likely be drier across many regions, but still some low end rain chances with cloudy skies. On Monday, heavy rain, and possibly a few thunderstorms return across parts of central, eastern and southern England, with parts of northeast England and Scotland looking gloomy and wet as well.\n\n“Eastern areas will start out mostly dry on Monday but a band of rain in the west will sweep eastwards throughout the day bringing rain to many places,” the UK Met office said in their forecast. “This rain will be followed by sunshine and scattered showers. Winds are expected to be fresh to strong with temperatures near average.”\n\nCNN’s Taylor Ward contributed to this post. This post has been updated.\n\nWho’s on the coronation guest list?\n\nIt’s the question everyone’s been asking: Who managed to get a coveted invite?\n\nAccording to Earl Marshall, the Duke of Norfolk – the man that orchestrated the entire occasion (in consultation with the UK government, church and many other parties) – around 2,300 people were sent invitations to the Westminster Abbey service.\n\nWhile Buckingham Palace doesn’t release a detailed guest list, it has confirmed that the congregation will be made up of members of the royal family as well as international representatives from 203 countries, Nobel Prize winners and members of the British government, alongside community and charity volunteers.\n\nPrince Harry has confirmed his attendance but his wife, Meghan, will be staying in California with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. It is understood Meghan opted to forgo the celebrations as the day coincides with Archie’s fourth birthday.\n\nUS President Joe Biden also won’t be attending and instead first lady Jill Biden will lead the American delegation. We’ll undoubtedly see allies of key nations in attendance, with French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese among those who have publicly confirmed they’ll be attending.\n\nWe can also expect to see a number of royals from around the world make their way to London, like Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium.\n\nAdditionally, 400 young people from charities selected by the King and Queen have been invited to watch the service from nearby St. Margaret’s Church, while military veterans, healthcare workers and charity representatives have been given spaces to watch on the processional route and in special stands put up along The Mall and near Buckingham Palace.\n\nBut it is still a much smaller guest list than the one drawn up for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953, when temporary structures had to be erected within the abbey to accommodate the more than 8,000 people invited.\n\nWATCH:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n11cdf402-2aa0-476b-9c7b-cf0fd42bff7b.mp4\n\n06:00 - Source: CNN\n\nIn pictures: A look back at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nIt’s been 70 years since Britain’s last coronation ceremony.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II took the throne in 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI. But her coronation ceremony was held more than a year later.\n\nHere’s what it what it looked like on that day in June 1953.\n\nRoyal superfans have been camping outside the palace for days\n\nDays before the coronation, huge numbers started gathering in central London. On Wednesday afternoon, well-wishers flocked to The Mall, waving flags and wearing crowns, with one goal in mind: Securing a prime position for Saturday.\n\n“We don’t have anything like this in America,” Donna Werner, 71, told CNN. She traveled to London from Connecticut, and has adored the royal family since Princess Diana. Werner has made the trip to London to camp out for every royal wedding ever since. “My friends at home think it’s silly, but I love it: The country, the history and the people,” she said. “They know it’s my thing.”\n\nMeanwhile, 58-year-old Kerry Evans, pictured below left, is originally from Northern Ireland and now lives in London. For every royal milestone, she joins her friend Bartly, who she met nearly five years ago while camping out for Harry and Meghan’s wedding, to celebrate the royals among the crowds. As the busy mother of two autistic sons, she said going to royal events was a way of taking a little time for herself.\n\n“These events are great because it is totally the opposite feeling from what my life is. Celebrating the royal family is a release – so the monarchy has become a big part of my life,” she said."
