        "text": "It’s been 19 years since King Charles III and Queen Camilla tied the knot. The then-Prince of Wales married Camilla Parker Bowles in a civil ceremony at the Guildhall, Windsor on April 9, 2005. Following the ceremony, a service of prayer and dedication was held at St. George’s Chapel with the groom’s parents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, in attendance.\n\nCharles’ sons Prince William and Prince Harry, as well as Camilla’s children from her first marriage, Laura and Tom Parker Bowles, joined them on their wedding day.\n\nAt the reception, Queen Elizabeth toasted the newlyweds, saying (via The Telegraph ): “They have overcome Becher’s Brook and The Chair and all kinds of other terrible obstacles, They have come through and I’m very proud and wish them well. My son is home and dry with the woman he loves.”\n\nCharles also gave a speech, thanking “my darling Camilla who has stood with me through thick and thin - and whose precious optimism and humour have seen me through.”\n\nThe royal couple celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary on Tuesday, April 9. Last year marked Charles and Camilla’s first wedding anniversary as King and Queen.\n\nAfter his ascension to the throne in 2022, Charles said, “This is also a time of change for my family. I count on the loving help of my darling wife, Camilla. In recognition of her own loyal public service since our marriage 17 years ago, she becomes my Queen Consort. I know she will bring to the demands of her new role the steadfast devotion to duty on which I have come to rely so much.”"
