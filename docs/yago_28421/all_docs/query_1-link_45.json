This war was the War of Spanish Succession and the main candidates for the crown were Duke of Anjou and Archduke Charles.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nPhilip V\n\nPhilip held the title of duc d’Anjou until 1700, when he emerged as a person of political importance. In that year Charles II, the last Habsburg king of Spain died and left Philip all his possessions. The refusal of Louis XIV to exclude Philip from the line of succession to the French throne resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession.During the first years of Philip’s reign France had a dominant influence on the Spanish court, and the French ambassador had a place on the council of state.\n\nWar of Spanish Succesion\n\nCharles II, king of Spain, died in 1700 without an heir.\n\nIn his will he gave the crown to the French prince Philip of Anjou.\n\nPhilip's grandfather, Louis XIV of France, then proclaimed him king of Spain, and declared that France and Spain would be united. France power was already feared in Europe, and Austria aimed to put the Archduke of Austria in the throne of Spain instead of Philip.\n\nNew Foundation Laws\n\nNew Foundation Laws are a set of decrees issued by King Philip V of Bourbon , who won the War of Spanish Succession, by which were abolished the laws and institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Aragon , the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Mallorca , all members of the Crown of Aragon who had opted for the Archduke Charles , putting an end to the composite structure of the Spanish monarchy of the Habsburgs.\n\nTreaty of Utrecht\n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht also called the peace of Ultrecht, were a series of treaties France and other European powers like Britain, the Dutch Republic ,Prussia, Portugal and Savoy.And another treaties between Spain and other powers concluding the War of Succession.

Louis ruled for a short period between the time his father Philip V abdicated in his favour until his death. On his death, his father returned to the throne, and reigned until his own death in 1746.\n\nThe three family compacts\n\nThe family compacts were several alliances (agreements) between the French and Spanish branches of the Bourbon family. There were three compacts: The Treaty of Escorial, that was the first one in 1733, the second agreement was in 1743, and finally the third one in 1761. England and France searched for Spanish support in the Seven Years War but the attack from England to the Spanish colonies made the King rejected the English offer that was in favour of the proposal made by the duc de Choiseul.\n\nFerdinand VI\n\nThird king of Spain of the house of Bourbon, he pursued a policy of neutrality and gradual reform.Was the second son of Philip V.When he succeeded to the throne he decided to avoid entanglements and was able to elude conflicts throughout his reign.

As king of Spain Charles III tried to rescue his empire from decay through reforms such as weakening the Church, promoting science and university research, facilitating trade and avoiding wars.\n\nTreaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris or The Treaty of 1763 was signed by Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, after Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War. This treaty ended the Seven Years’ War between Great Britain and France.It marked the end of that phase of European conflict in North America, and created the basis for the modern country of Canada.\n\nEsquilache Riots\n\nThe Esquilache Riots were caused mostly by the growing discontent in Madrid about the rising costs of bread and other staples, they were sparked off by some measures regarding Spaniards' apparel that had been enacted Marquis of Esquilache.

The aim of the reforms was to curb the increasing autonomy and self-confidence of American-born Spaniards and reassert the crown control.\n\nAmerican Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Continental Congress meeting at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies,then at war with Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer a part of the British Empire.\n\nCharles IV\n\nIn 1788, Charles III died and Charles IV succeeded to the throne.He kept up the appearance of an absolute, powerful monarch,Charles never took more than a passive part in his own government.However, in the wake of the war against Republican France, Count of Aranda was himself replaced by Manuel de Godoy.Economic troubles, rumours about a sexual relationship between the Queen and Godoy,caused the monarchy to decline in prestige among the population.\n\nFrench Revolution- Storming of Bastille\n\nThe Bastille was a fortress and prison that used to be a symbol of the abuse of the monarchy and it represented the king and his goverment. The Bastille was the beggining of the revolution against the monarch Louis XVI.\n\n(source:photocopies in class)\n\nWar of Pyrenees\n\nPyrenean front of the First Coalition's.

The French army drove the Spanish back into Catalonia.In the Pyrenees, the French began to win and finally controlled a northern part of Spain.\n\nExecution of Louis XVI\n\nLouis was executed by the guillotine in Paris.

The war on the peninsula lasted until the Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814.\n\nAbdications of Bayonne\n\nThe Abdications of Bayonne is the name given to a series of forced abdications of the Kings of Spain that led to the Spanish War of Independence. This were the successive resignations of King Charles IV and his son Ferdinand VII to the throne of Spain in favor of Napoleon Bonaparte.The French Emperor, soon after, gave these rights to his brother Joseph Bonaparte , who reigned under the name of Joseph I.\n\nJoseph I Reign\n\nNapoleonic Spain was the part of Spain loyal to Joseph I during the Peninsular War (1808–1813) after the country was partially occupied by French forces. The country was considered a client state of the First French Empire. That part of Spain which continued to resist French occupation remained loyal to Ferdinand VII and allied with Britain and Portugal to expel Napoleon's armies from Spain. Finally, this meant the defeat of Joseph´s reign and Ferdinand VII was recognized king of Spain.\n\nFirst Constitution\n\nOn 19 March 1812, Spain’s first constitution was drawn up in Cadiz, enshrining the rights of Spanish citizens and limiting the power of the monarchy. Although it was not enacted for some years, its influence was considerable, both within peninsular Spain and its territories around the world.The First Constitution was also called \"La Pepa\".\n\nFerdinand VII\n\nFerdinand´s reign is divided into three periods.
