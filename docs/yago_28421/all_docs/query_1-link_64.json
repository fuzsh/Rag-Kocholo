        "text": "Philip V First Reign\n\nDecretos de Nueva Planta\n\nThe Decretos de Nueva Planta were a set of decrees issued by King Philip V, victor of the War of Spanish Succession, by which were abolished laws and institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Mallorca, all members of the Crown of Aragon who had opted for the Archduke Charles, ending the composite structure of the Spanish monarchy of the Habsburgs. The \"New Ground\" was also applied to the Crown of Castile.\n\nDecrees of the Kingdom of Valencia\n\nThe Decree of Nueva Planta of the Kingdom of Valencia was a decree issued by Philip V of Spain on June 29, 1707 during the War of Spanish Succession, in which were abolished the charters and the institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia.\n\nDecrees of the Kingdom of Aragon\n\nPhilip V declared the \"abolished and repealed of all the charters, privileges, practice and custom hitherto observed in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, being my will that they be reduced to the laws of Castile and to its form of government\", This was justified based on three arguments: breaking the oath of allegiance to the king, the absolute rule of the king in all his kingdoms and states and the right of conquest that allowed him to impose his law on the territories conquered.\n\nThe Pragmatic Sanction\n\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 was an edict issued by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI to ensure that the hereditary possessions of the Habsburgs could be inherited by a daughter. The Pragmatic Sanction was the first such document to be publicly announced and as such required formal acceptance by the estates of the realms it concerned. For 10 years, Charles VI labored, with the support of his closest advisor Johann Christoph von Bartenstein, to have his sanction accepted by the courts of Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht\n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht. The signers are: Louis XIV of France, Philip V of Spain, Anne of Great Britain, John V of Portugal, United Provinces.\n\nThe treaty marked the end of French ambitions of hegemony in Europe expressed in the wars of Louis XIV and preserved the European system based on the balance of power.\n\nDecrees of the Crown of Castile\n\nThese decrees caused:\n\nThe Council of State is deprived of all its functions passed to the Council of Castile.\n\nA reform is made to the Council of Castile in order to make it the superior organ of the monarchical structure and convert it into a governing council.\n\nCastile loses its specific territorial character.\n\nIsabella Farnese of Parma First Reign\n\nShe was the consort queen of Spain.\n\nIsabella Farnese of Parma First Reign\n\nHer policy was based on recovering for the Spanish monarchy, Italian territories lost by the Treaty of Utrecht. So, she got to his son Charles, the kingdom of Naples and Sicily besides giving her other son, Philip, the Duchy of Parma.\n\nDecrees of the Kingdom of Mallorca\n\nThese decrees caused:\n\nThe insaculatorio system for the election of officers was already deleted, thereafter they would be appointed by the king or the commander in chief.\n\nThe public law was supressed.\n\nMallorca lost the right to mint its own currency.\n\nThe Castilian system of the mayor and aldermen was imposed.\n\nDecrees of the Principality of Catalonia\n\nThey abolished the Parliament and the Council of One Hundred.\n\nThe viceroy was replaced by a commander in chief and Catalonia was divided into twelve \"Corregidurías\", therefore the batlled remained.\n\nThe somatenes (armed militias in Catalonia and Aragon) are prohibited.\n\nTaxing the urban and rural properties and benefits of labor, trade and industry was established.\n\nThe official language of the Court ceased to be Latin and was replaced by the Castilian.\n\nLouis I Reign\n\nLouis I succeeded the throne after the abdication of his father, Philip V, who also regained the throne after the death of Louis I from smallpox. He ruled 7 months and 17 days.\n\nLouis I Reign\n\nPhilip V Second Reign\n\nHis second reign was due to the death of Louis I, his son, who his rule lasted less than a year.\n\nPhilip V Second Reign\n\nHe became ill and he named his son as king but only lasted eight months.\n\nCharles III Reign\n\nTreaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, also known as the Peace of Paris and the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February, 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, after Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War.The signing of the treaty formally ended the Seven Years' War. Otherwise known as the French and Indian War in the North American theatre, which marked the beginning of an era of British dominance outside Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Hubertusburg\n\nIt was signed on 15 February, 1763 at Hubertusburg by Prussia, and Austria. Together with the Treaty of Paris, it marked the end of the French and Indian War and of the Seven Years' War. The treaty ended the continental conflict with no significant changes in prewar borders. Silesia remained Prussian, and Prussia clearly stood among the ranks of the great powers. Austria's resolve to repossess the rich province of Silesia, which had been lost to Prussia in 1748.\n\nEsquilache Riots\n\nThey occurred during the rule of Charles III of Spain. It was caused by many different reasons, for example: The constant rise of the price of staples or the suspicion of the Spaniards in the foreign ministers brought by Carlos III. However, the most important cause was that traditional long capes and white-brimmed hats were prohibited because they allowed criminals to conceal their faces. All these was caused by the Marquis of Esquilache.\n\nExpulsion of the Jesuits\n\nThe Jesuits are a male religious order belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. It was founded in 1540 in Rome (Italy) by Ignatius of Loyola. With the Bourbon succession of 1700 began the fight in Spain, to establish national sovereignty as the basis for a reversal of the economic devastation which brought the theocratic imperial reign of the Inquisition. In addition to poverty, chastity and obedience, Jesuits have a special fourth vow: obedience to the pope whatever it is.\n\nGaspar Melchor de Jovellanos wrote the Honest Offender\n\nHe was an ilustrated Spanish writer, lawyer and politician. Jovellanos's prose works, especially those on political and legislative economy, constitute his real claim to literary fame. In them, depth of thought and clear-sighted sagacity are couched in a certain Ciceronian elegance and classical purity of style. Besides the Ley Agraria, he wrote Elogios, and an interesting set of diaries or travel journals (1790–1801, first published in 1915) reflecting his trips across Northern Spain.\n\nFloridablanca Count was Secretary of the State\n\nJosé Moñino y Redondo was a Spanish statesman. He was the reformist chief minister of King Charles III of Spain, and also served briefly under Charles IV. He was arguably Spain's most effective statesman in the eighteenth century. In Spain, he is simply known as Conde de Floridablanca.\n\nGoya became painter of Charles III\n\nIn 1786 he became the King's painter. The King promoted Goya to Painter of the Chamber and sat for a portrait. The King was very pleased with the result. He started the portrait in 1786 and he finished it in 1788.\n\nCharles IV Reign\n\nHe was born on 11 November, 1748. His parents were Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony. He got married with Maria Luisa of Parma. He intended to maintain the policies of his father and maintained his prime minister,the Count of Floridablanca, in office. Riots and a popular revolt at the winter palace Aranjuez in 1808 forced the king to abdicate on 19 March, in favour of his son. Ferdinand took the throne as Ferdinand VII, but was mistrusted by Napoleon.\n\nCharles IV Reign\n\nTomás Zumalacárregui\n\nHe was a Basque Carlist general. The proclamation of the king's daughter Isabel as heiress was almost the occasion of an armed conflict between him and the naval authorities at Ferrol. He gradually obtained full possession of Navarre and organized the forces known as aduaneros and the Guías de Navarra. He won the battles of Alsasua, Alegría de Álava, and Venta de Echavarri. He died on 24 June, 1835.\n\nEl Baile de San Antonio de la Florida\n\nEl Baile de San Antonio de la Florida or dancing on the banks of the Manzanares is a cardboard painted by Francisco Goya for the dining room of the Prince of Asturias in the Brown Skin. In this work you can still see the imprint of Mengs and Bayeu, still supervising Goya cartons. The Aragonese describes the picture as «dos majos y dos majas que bailan seguidillas». In a second term musicians, a military and a pestle is observed. In the background, appears the church of San Francisco el Grande.\n\nGoya was Deaf\n\nGoya's position was secured with Charles III, but at the age of 46 years he suddenly collapsed. He suffered a grave and mysterious illness and was blind, paralysed and closed to madness. He was stone deaf after he recovered. In spite of all his ill health, Goya gained two more sponsors, Duke and Duchess of Alba. It was said that Goya and the Duchess of Alba were lovers and that she inspired two of his most famous paintings: The Naked Maja and The Clothed Maja.\n\nWar of Pyrenees\n\nThe Great War, also known as the War of Pyrenees, faced The the Kingdom of Spain against the revolutionary France, between 1793 and 1795. Spain lost Roussillon and Cerdanya.Peace between Spain and France was signed on November 7, 1659.\n\nThe Execution of Louis XVI\n\nThe execution of Louis XVI, by means of the guillotine, took place at the Place de la Révolution. It was a major event of the French Revolution. After events on the 10 August 1792, which saw the fall of the monarchy after the attack on the Tuileries by insurgents, Louis was arrested, interned in the Temple prison with his family, tried for high treason before the National Convention, found guilty by almost all, and condemned to death by a slight majority.\n\nCapricho \"Tal para cual\"\n\nGoya produced his first etchings, los Caprichos in which he showed the folly of humans. They are full with monsters, witches and goblins. The central image is called 'The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters' and shows the nightmare which Goya fears when reason 'sleeps'. One of his Caprichos is called \"Tal para cual\" and he painted it in 1799.\n\nCharles IV's Family Painting by Goya\n\nCharles IV of Spain and his family is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya who began to work on this painting in 1800 and completed it in the summer of 1801.The royal family is apparently paying a visit to the artist's studio, while Goya can be seen to the left looking outwards towards the view.\n\nThe Spanish Defeat at Trafalgar\n\nThe Battle of Trafalgar was a naval engagement fought by the Royal Navy against the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies, during the War of the Third Coalition of the Napoleonic Wars. Twenty-seven British ships of the line led by Admiral Lord Nelson defeated thirty-three French and Spanish ships of the line under French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. The prevailing tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single line of battle.\n\nNapoleonic Troops in Spain\n\nTretay of Fountainebleau\n\nThe Treaty of Fontainebleau was a political agreement that was signed between Napoleon Bonaparte of France and Charles IV of Spain on October 27, 1807, in Fontainebleau, France. It was agreed that Portugal and all Portuguese dominions were to be divided between the signatories; by this accord Napoleon wanted to secure and ensure the Continental Blockade he had imposed on Britain in 1806 by capturing the Portuguese ports.\n\nThe photograph shows the partition of Portugal, proposed by Napoleon.\n\nAbdication of Bayonne\n\nThe Abdications of Bayonne is the name given to a series of forced abdications of the Kings of Spain that led to the Peninsular War. The failed El Escorial Conspiracy preceded the Mutiny of Aranjuez, which forced King Charles IV to abdicate the throne to his son Ferdinand VII in 1808 by order of the Spanish Royal Council.\n\nFerdinand VII First Reign\n\nWhen his father's abdication was extorted by a popular riot at Aranjuez in March 1808, he ascended the throne but turned again to Napoleon, in the hope that the emperor would support him.\n\nEvents of 2 May 1808\n\nOutbreak of the Peninsular War: The people of Madrid rise up in rebellion against French occupation. Francisco de Goya later memorializes this event in his painting \"The Second of May\" in 1808.\n\nJoseph I Reign\n\nHe was born on 7 January, 1768.
