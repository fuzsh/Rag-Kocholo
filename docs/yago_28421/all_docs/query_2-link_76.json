        "text": "King Charles and Queen Camilla are celebrating their 19th wedding anniversary – and much has changed since their coronation day.\n\nThe King, 75, and Queen, 76, marked 19 years of marriage on April 9, and the milestone doubled their first wedding anniversary following their crowning on May 6, 2023. Though Charles immediately succeeded his mother, Queen Elizabeth, as monarch upon her death in September 2022, the crowning ceremony at Westminster Abbey continued nearly a thousand years of tradition to symbolically install King Charles as sovereign — and became the day a new title was formalized for Queen Camilla.\n\nAccording to the BBC, a royal source said the coronation created an appropriate moment to instate the Queen title after previously being known as Queen Consort for the start of her husband’s reign to distinguish her from Queen Elizabeth. In a message timed to the eve of her Accession Day in February 2022, Queen Elizabeth shared her wish that Camilla would be known as Queen Consort when Charles became monarch, and the coronation invitation was the first palace document to verify her styling as Queen Camilla.\n\nQueen Camilla thoughtfully nodded to her late mother-in-law that October by wearing the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland tiara for the first time. The headpiece is sentimental for its close association with the late Queen Elizabeth, who wore the sparkler many times throughout her record 70-year reign and is even included in her depiction on some British and Commonwealth banknotes and coins.\n\nAt Christmas, King Charles reportedly tweaked tradition and invited Queen Camilla’s family members to celebrate Christmas at Sandringham for the first time. In years past, Camilla would leave the festivities in the afternoon to spend time with her son Tom Parker Bowles, daughter Laura Lopes and their children, so the idea of an invite would bring everyone together. Queen Camilla’s three grandsons Freddy Lopes, Gus Lopes and Louis Lopes served as her Pages of Honor during the crowning ceremony (just as Prince George did for King Charles) and appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the palace announced that King Charles was seeking treatment for an benign enlarged prostate, adding that his \"public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.\"\n\nIt's understood that the King wanted to share his diagnosis to encourage men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked, marking a modern departure from previous royal generations who preferred to remain tight-lipped regarding their medical information.\n\nA royal source told PEOPLE that the King would be capable of fulfilling his constitutional requirements and duties during this time, and Queen Camilla visited her husband multiple times at The London Clinic, where he had surgery. The private hospital in the Marylebone neighborhood of London had two royal patients, as Kate Middleton had \"planned abdominal surgery\" there on Jan. 16 and recovered at the hub afterward.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Buckingham Palace shared the shocking news that King Charles was diagnosed with cancer following the prostate operation.\n\n\"During The King's recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" the palace said in a statement.\n\n\"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual,\" it continued.\n\n\"The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"His Majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.\"\n\nThough King Charles kept his exact diagnosis private, a spokesperson said it is not prostate cancer.\n\nAround the same time, a palace insider told PEOPLE that Queen Camilla would be a key strength for the King.\n\n\"She is his strength and stay like [Prince Philip] was for the late Queen,\" the source said. \"She will be great. She will rally him, she will buoy him. She is amazing. She equips him to do the job he has to do. \"\n\nQueen Camilla has played an important role in supporting her husband throughout his treatment while continuing a full schedule of public duties and leading the way at two major royal events last month. On March 11, Queen Camilla represented the King at the Commonwealth Day Service of Celebration at Westminster Abbey and entered the event alongside Prince William while the monarch appeared via video.\n\n\"I have been most deeply touched by your wonderfully kind and thoughtful good wishes for my health and, in return, can only continue to serve you, to the best of my ability, throughout the Commonwealth,\" King Charles said in a pre-recorded address, referencing well-wishes around his health.\n\nTwo weeks later, Queen Camilla made history by distributing the Royal Maundy gifts on behalf of her husband at the annual Royal Maundy Service on March 28, becoming the first consort to lead the ancient tradition, which traces its roots back to 600 A.D.\n\nQueen Camilla has also continued to be a steadying presence as Princess Kate announced on March 22 that she is undergoing treatment for cancer and Prince William takes time to be with his wife. During a solo stop at the Shrewsbury Farmers’ Market on March 27, the Queen promised to deliver posters that two young girls made that read, \"Send our love to Kate.\"\n\n\"Her Majesty said: 'I know that Catherine is thrilled by all the kind wishes and support,' \" royal editor Rebecca English of the Daily Mail wrote on X.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla most recently stepped out together for the Easter Mattins Service at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where they sat apart from other royal family members and didn’t attend a reception or lunch afterward. The King’s doctors have advised him to limit the number of people he comes in contact with during his cancer treatment, though he has continued working behind the scenes and hosting small audiences.\n\nAfter church on Easter, the King and Queen briefly greeted members of the public during a mini walkabout, where the monarch commented on his health.\n\n\"Get well soon, Your Majesty,\" one woman said in a video English shared to X, prompting King Charles to reply, \"I'm doing my best!\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?
