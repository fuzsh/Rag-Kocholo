        "text": "Charles III, King of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, has enjoyed a longer apprenticeship, not just than any monarch, but anyone else on Earth in gainful employment. He became heir to the throne at the age of 3 in 1952 when his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, acceded to the throne. He became king in September 2022, 70 years later.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles has long championed the cause of environmental sustainability, as well as setting up The Prince’s Trust, which supports young people in community projects and business endeavours.\n\nIn the media, he has featured most often for his love life: his fairy tale wedding to Diana, their disastrous marriage, and his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, a woman married to another man. After Diana's death, it was down to him to bring up his two sons, William and Harry.\n\nAs king, he will have to spend more time fulfilling the official and ceremonial functions of monarchy. Much of this will be a question of following his mother’s example, including keeping his views on anything political to himself. That may be the biggest challenge he faces, as he enjoys speaking his mind. In 1984, he famously denounced modern architecture, calling a proposed extension to London's National Gallery a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend.\" However, as king, any mild comment touching on a political issue could trigger a constitutional crisis.\n\nCome what may, Charles III will have to find his own style, one that his subjects can accept and admire or, in the case of British republicans, at least put up with."
