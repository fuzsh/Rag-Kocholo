        "text": "Pacte de Famille, any of three defensive alliances (1733, 1743, and 1761) between France and Spain, so called because both nations were ruled by members of the Bourbon family. The Pactes de Famille generally had the effect of involving Spain in European and colonial wars on the side of the French Bourbons (e.g., the Seven Years’ War, 1756–63). Spain also followed French policy in the American Revolution (1775–83). After the outbreak of the French Revolution, Charles IV of Spain sought to intervene to save Louis XVI and, after his execution, engaged Spain in the war of 1793–95, ending in the humiliating Peace of Basel. After the restoration of the French Bourbons in 1814–15, the French intervened in 1823 to restore the authority of Ferdinand VII of Spain."
