        "text": "Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli, arrived in Madrid on 7 August 1737. King Philip V and his wife Elisabeth Farnese were deeply impressed by his vocal qualities and invited him to remain in their service, on extremely rewarding terms. Although few sources concerning his first months in Spain are available, a newly discovered libretto, L'ombra di Luigi XIV il Grande, sheds light on his position at the Spanish court and his response to the privileged situation he enjoyed. The work is a short solo cantata commissioned by Farinelli and offered to Philip V for his name day in 1738. The title-page indicates Francesco Feo as the composer, but no sources for the musical setting have yet been located, nor any information about a performance of the work. This article examines the content of the cantata's text and situates it within what is known about the life of Farinelli. It also reconstructs in detail the literary career of the author of the text, Giuseppe di Rosa, who was also a magistrate and historian. Additionally, it links the genesis of this encomiastic piece with the activity of Giovanni Battista Filomarino, Neapolitan ambassador at the court of Madrid.\n\n30 Le bbinte rotola de lo valanzone was published in Naples for the first time in 1746 and again in 1787 (the title, which can be translated as ‘the twenty weights of the big scale’, alludes to the name of the institution, literally ‘Academy of the arcade of the steelyard’); here I quote from the critical edition contained in Poeti e prosatori del Settecento, ed. Rosa Troiano, two volumes (Rome: Gabriele e Mariateresa Benincasa, 1994), volume 1. For the original rules see Giovanni Giuseppe Carulli, Notizia della origine del Portico della Stadera e delle leggi colle quali si governa (Naples: Stamperia muziana, 1743).\n\n64 See Gaceta de Madrid (6 May 1738), 72: ‘Sus magestades, y altezas se mantienen con perfecta salud en su palacio del sitio de Aranjuez. El dia primero de este mes, en que se celebrò la fiesta de San Phelipe, cuyo nombre tiene el rey nuestro señor, se vistiò toda la corte de gala en aquel real sitio, y concurriò con la grandeza y ministros estrangeros al besamanos, que con aquel motivo huvo en palacio’ (Their Majesties and highnesses remain in perfect health in their palace at Aranjuez. On the first day of this month, on which was celebrated the feast of Saint Philip (the name-day of our lord the king), the entire court dressed up in festive clothing at that royal place, and together with the nobles and the foreign ministers attended the hand-kissing that took place in the palace for that reason).\n\n67 McGeary, ‘Farinelli in Madrid’, 412. Farinelli was very happy not to tread the boards any more. He had already expressed this desire to Pepoli on 23 May 1735: ‘sempre più mi metto in testa la massima di lasciare la professione prima che lei lascia me’ (more and more I conceive the purpose of leaving the profession before it leaves me). Broschi Farinelli, La solitudine amica, 136. On 16 February 1738 he announced to the same: ‘Dio ha esaudito le mie preghiere più tosto di quello ch'io speravo: l'anno prossimo avevo di già fissato il non cantar più in teatri, non potendo ne più soffrire né le fatiche né il teatro, né il costume della turba’ (God answered my prayers sooner than I hoped: I had already decided not to sing in the theatres next year, as I could no longer suffer the hardships, nor the theatre, nor the behaviour of the crowd). Broschi Farinelli, La solitudine amica, 143.\n\n68 See Margarita Torrione, ‘Fiesta y teatro musical en el reinado de Felipe V e Isabel de Farnesio: Farinelli, artífice de una resurrección’, in El Real Sitio de La Granja de San Ildefonso: retrato y escena del rey (Madrid: Patrimonio Nacional, 2000), 222, and Morales, L'artiste de cour, 242–243. An ensemble of three chamber musicians accompanied Broschi in the serenata he performed in October 1739 to welcome to Alcalá Louise Élisabeth of France, wife of the Infante Felipe; see Gaceta de Madrid (27 October 1739), 315–316 (quoted also in Crónica festiva, 204), as well as the singer's letter to Pepoli dated 14 November 1739 (Broschi Farinelli, La solitudine amica, 157).\n\n70 I know very few examples of encomiastic pieces partially or totally based on historical subjects. The untitled cantata by an unknown poet and an unknown composer performed in Leghorn in 1756 to solemnize the birth of Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria is based on a dialogue between the shade of Emperor Charles VI (1685–1740), grandfather of the child, and Fame; see In occasione delle pubbliche feste in Livorno per la nascita del serenissimo arciduca Massimiliano Francesco Saverio Giuseppe Antonio Giovanni Venceslao. Componimento per musica (Leghorn: Antonio Santini[, 1756]). The characters of Gli Elisi o sia L'ombre degli Eroi by Ranieri Calzabigi and Vito Giuseppe Millico, offered to the King of Sweden Gustav III during his stay in Naples in 1784, are two famous Swedish sovereigns, Gustav I (1496–1560) and Christina (1626–1689); see Lucio Tufano, I viaggi di Orfeo: musiche e musicisti intorno a Ranieri Calzabigi (Rome: Edicampus, 2012), 139–181.\n\n75 The French king proudly shows Philip's success to a young man on the far-right side of the scene, who is probably James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766), nicknamed The Old Pretender. His father, the Catholic James II, had been deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and went into exile with his family to France, where he found protection with his cousin Louis XIV (the first of the above-mentioned verses clearly alludes to this circumstance). On James II's death in 1701, James Francis Edward was recognized by Louis as the rightful heir to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland. Therefore the gesture depicted in the 1703 calendar means that the Roi Soleil supports the young prince's claims to the British crown and is willing to offer him help as he has already done with Philip."
