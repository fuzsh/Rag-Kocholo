        "text": "King Charles and Queen Camilla’s love story has been anything but conventional. Despite marrying Diana Spencer, Charles never got over his former girlfriend—and against all odds (and through no small amount of royal scandal) they got their happy ending 35 years after they first met. Here’s the true story of how their twisty, turn-y love story played out.\n\n1947\n\nCamilla Shand is born on July 17th, making her 16 months older than her future husband, Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, born November 14, 1948. The daughter of a British Army officer, Camilla grows up socializing with royals and attends Queens Gate school in London and finishing schools in Switzerland.\n\nCamilla, 4, and her 3-year-old sister Annabelle, at a wedding in 1952; Prince Charles the same year.\n\n1970\n\nCharles and Camilla meet for the first time at a polo match at Windsor Great Park, a royal park. They discover that they both love polo and the outdoors and have the same sense of humor. Camilla jokes about the fact that her great-grandmother had had an affair with King Edward VII, saying, “My great-grandmother was the mistress of your great-great-grandfather. I feel we have something in common.”\n\nThey begin dating, but Charles leaves to serve in the Royal Navy for eight months. When he returns, Camilla is engaged to someone else.\n\n1973\n\nAn Army cavalry officer seven years older than Camilla—and who had previously dated Prince Charles’s sister, Princess Anne—Andrew Parker Bowles, becomes Camilla's first husband, despite the fact that he apparently hadn't even proposed when his family and Camilla's had an engagement announcement published, effectively forcing the issue. In July, the couple marries.\n\nCamilla Shand marries Major Andrew Parker-Bowles, July 4, 1973.\n\nThey go on to have two children, Tom and Laura. Charles and Camilla are still friends—in fact, Charles becomes Tom’s godfather.\n\n1980\n\nCharles, 31, begins dating Lady Diana Spencer, 18. The prince had briefly dated her older sister, Lady Sarah Spencer, who takes credit for the match, saying, “I introduced them—I’m Cupid.”\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles walk with their friend Lady Sarah Keswick In 1979; Charles and Diana in 1981.\n\n1981\n\nCharles proposes to Diana on February 6. (One report suggests that he popped the question in Camilla’s garden.) After the news breaks on February 24, he makes a somewhat jarring comment when a television interviewer asks him and Diana if they’re in love. Diana blushes and says, “Of course;” Charles adds, “Whatever love means.” But he sounds more smitten in a newspaper interview at the time: \"I feel positively delighted and frankly amazed that Di is prepared take me on.\"\n\nOn July 29, with an estimated 750 million people watching around the world—and with Camilla reportedly in attendance—they marry in St. Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nDiana Spencer and Prince Charles ride in a carriage after their wedding at St. Paul’s Cathedral July 29, 1981 in London.\n\nCharles and Diana will go on to have two sons, Prince William, born in 1982, and Prince Harry, born in 1984. However, their relationship soon becomes rocky.\n\n1986\n\nAccording to Charles’s authorized biography, he begins an affair with Camilla.\n\n1989\n\nDiana confronts Camilla, approaching her at a party and saying, “I know what's going on between you and Charles and I just want you to know that. She said to me: 'You've got everything you ever wanted. You've got all the men in the world fall in love with you and you've got two beautiful children, what more do you want?' So I said, 'I want my husband.' And I said, 'I'm sorry I'm in the way...and it must be hell for both of you. But I do know what's going on. Don't treat me like an idiot,'\" the princess later revealed.\n\n1992\n\nIn June, Andrew Morton’s book is released; the Princess of Wales had recorded multiple tapes for the freelancer writer, and its publication shocked the world, thanks to its explosive stories about Diana’s jealousy over Charles’s involvement with Camilla. Questions arise about whether Charles could be king if he was divorced and remarried—under the strictures of the time, he wouldn’t be allowed a second marriage in the Church of England, as the King is the secular head of the church. In December, just days before the wedding of Princess Anne and her second husband Timothy Laurence, Prime Minister John Major announces that Charles and Diana had officially separated.\n\nPrince Charles and Princess Diana on their last official trip together, a visit to Korea.\n\n1993\n\nIn January, a transcript of a suggestive, secretly-recorded 1989 phone conversation between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles (known as Camillagate) is first published in an Australian magazine and a German tabloid. British tabloids redact the most explicit (and embarrassing) elements of the private call. The news breaks only a month after transcripts of a secretly-recorded call between Diana and a man named James Gilbey (in which he calls her by the nickname Squidgy) were published.\n\n1994\n\nPrince Charles had allowed a documentary filmmaker to follow him for a year and a half in the hopes of repairing the damage to his reputation caused by the stories of his adultery. When the documentary airs, one portion has the opposite effect.\n\nThe filmmaker, Jonathan Dimbleby, asks Charles if he was “faithful and honorable” during his marriage to Diana. Charles says, The prince also discusses Camilla, calling her \"a great friend of mine,\" he said. He adds, \"She has been a friend for a very long time—and will continue to be a friend for a very long time.\"\n\n1995\n\nIn January, Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles . That November, Martin Bashir does a now-infamous televised interview with Diana where he asks if Camilla was a factor in the breakdown of her marriage. She says sadly, \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\"\n\nA later investigation would conclude that Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, was “deceived and induced” by Bashir to arrange a meeting with the Princess, and that Bashir used deceptive practices to obtain her agreement to the interview. The BBC issued an apology in 2021, and ultimately stated that they would never re-air the interview.\n\n1996\n\nCharles and Diana’s divorce is finalized.\n\n1997\n\nShortly after Charles hosts a 50th birthday party for Camilla at his country home, Highgrove, Diana dies tragically in a car accident in Paris. As the world mourns the loss of the People’s Princess, Charles, along with Diana’s sisters, flies to Paris to bring Diana’s body back to England.\n\nCharles, Prince Philip, Princes William and Harry, and Diana’s brother walk in the funeral procession as mourners line the streets and pile flowers in front of Diana’s residence at Kensington Palace. Due to the overwhelming outpouring of grief for Diana, Charles pauses his campaign to introduce the public to his relationship with Camilla.\n\nPrince Charles, Prince Harry, Diana’s brother Earl Spencer, Prince William and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh during Princess Diana’s funeral in London.\n\n1998\n\nCharles gradually resumes the process of legitimizing his relationship. He confirms a report in a British tabloid that Camilla met Prince William, and the papers speculate that she will meet Prince Harry soon as well. However, the Queen doesn’t approve of the previously-adulterous relationship, and declined to attend a private 50th birthday party for Charles because Camilla would be there.\n\n1999\n\nIn January, Charles throws a birthday party for Camilla’s sister at the Ritz Hotel in London. He and Camilla arrive separately but leave the party together in full view of the crowds of reporters and photographers ready to capture them appearing in public together for the first time. Later that year, she and Charles vacation in Greece with Princes William and Harry.\n\nCharles and Camilla enjoy a night out.\n\n2000\n\nCharles and Camilla still face the hurdle of getting the Queen’s official approval for their relationship—a key matter to enable Camilla to appear publicly at royal events, and potentially join the royal family. Ultimately, the Queen accepts an invitation to an event at Highgrove—a 60th birthday party for the King of Greece—knowing Camilla would be there. It’s interpreted as a sign that she accepts the relationship.\n\n2003\n\nThe couple move into Clarence House. The Royal Family make it known that British taxpayer money won’t be used to decorate Camilla’s rooms.\n\n2005\n\nIn February, Charles and Camilla, announce their engagement, 35 years after they first met. On April 8, they marry in a civil ceremony with Prince William as the best man. The Queen does not attend the wedding, but does go to the reception afterward. In order to have Diana remain as the only Princess of Wales, Camilla gains the title Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nCharles and Camilla on their wedding day with their families, left to right: Prince Harry, Prince Philip, Prince William, Queen Elizabeth, Camilla’s father Major Bruce Shand, and her children Tom and Laura Parker Bowles.\n\n2010\n\nQuestions remain about what title Camilla could receive when Charles becomes King. Because Camilla is seen as part of the reason Charles’s first marriage ended, the official royal position is that she would receive the title of Princess Consort instead of Queen. But in an interview with Brian Williams, when asked, \"Does the Duchess of Cornwall become Queen of England if and when you become the monarch?\" Charles answered, \"That could be.\" After an uproar in England, the Palace responds by saying nothing has changed and Princess Consort is still the intended title for Camilla.\n\nOn the balcony after Will and Kate’s wedding in 2011, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are photographed with Carole Middleton and Camilla’s granddaughter, Eliza Lopes, who was a bridesmaid.\n\n2016\n\nCamilla and Prince William are named to the Privy Council, a group of the Queen’s most senior advisors. Reports speculate that the Queen wants to ensure that they both will be present when Charles is named the King after her death.\n\n2017\n\nOn May 27, approaching her 70th birthday, Camilla gives an interview to the Daily Mail where she refers obliquely to her affair with Charles and the press attention that came with it. “It was horrid. It was a deeply unpleasant time and I wouldn’t want to put my worst enemy through it. I couldn’t have survived it without my family.” Asked if she is good at moving on, she says, “Most definitely, yes.”\n\nCharles and Camilla visit the Grand Mosque on the first day of a Royal tour of the United Arab Emirates in 2016.\n\n2020\n\nThe couple self-isolate at Birkhall, their home on the Queen's Balmoral estate, amid the coronavirus pandemic. Charles tests positive for the virus, but experiences a mild case and recovers quickly; the couple is reunited after they complete their respective quarantines. To mark their 15th wedding anniversary, they release a photo of themselves outside Birkhall with their dogs Bluebell and Beth. (Charles would later get COVID a second time in 2022.)\n\n2022\n\nAs part of a message released for her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen shocks many with the statement that it is her \"sincere wish\" that Camilla should be known as Queen Consort when Charles takes to the throne. A Clarence House spokesperson responds that the prince and duchess are \"touched and honored by Her Majesty's words.\"\n\nThe couple later appear alongside the Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the final event of the Platinum Jubilee. Unlike Trooping the Colour a few days prior, in which all of the working royals had appeared on the balcony, on this occasion, only the most direct line of succession—Prince Charles and Prince William—and their wives, along with William's children, were present, sending a subtle message about the future of the monarchy.\n\nCamilla's title becomes official following Queen Elizabeth's death and King Charles's accession to the throne in September 2022. A statement from the royal family reads: \"The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.\"\n\nCamilla, now the Queen Consort, remains by her husband's side throughout the mourning ceremonies for Queen Elizabeth, and the early days of King Charles III's reign. Following a period of mourning in the late Queen's honor, Camilla and Charles both return to their duties as working royals.\n\n2023\n\nJust a month before King Charles's coronation, the royal family confirms that Camilla will use the title Queen Camilla. They make as much clear on the coronation invitation and later on the official website. On May 6, she is crowned alongside her husband at Westminster Abbey.\n\nCharles and Camilla on their coronation day in 2023.\n\nThroughout the year she continues to carry out her new duties as queen, including standing by Charles's side as he accepts the Honours of Scotland, symbolizing his power over the country, and later joins him for the royal family's annual Scottish holiday, where Charles marks the anniversary of his mother's death at Balmoral.\n\n2024\n\nCharles and Camilla are seen leaving The London Clinic in late January 2024."
