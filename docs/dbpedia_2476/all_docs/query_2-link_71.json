She is currently on the board for the Dix Park Conservancy, and Shepherd’s Table Soup Kitchen, which serves 200 to 300 meals daily to downtown Raleigh’s food-insecure population. She is an active member of the Southern Foodways Alliance and founded the biannual event Stir the Pot, in which she hosts visiting chefs in Raleigh to raise funds for the alliance’s documentary initiatives.\n\nFounder and CEO, The Pink Ceiling\n\nCindy Eckert is the founder and CEO of The Pink Ceiling, an organization committed to investing in and supporting companies made by and for women. Through The Pink Ceiling and The Pinkubator, Eckert has supported female entrepreneurs and health technology companies at various levels of development, each with products aimed at tangible improvements for real people.\n\nEckert began her career in the pharmaceutical industry. With a distinguished 25-year career in healthcare, Eckert in only the last ten years has built two pharmaceutical businesses from the ground up, which she then sold for over $1.5 billion. One of these, Sprout Pharmaceuticals, broke new ground with the release of the first ever FDA-approved drug to improve low libido in females. Eckert reacquired the rights to the drug after selling in efforts to ensure its ethical launch and marketing.\n\nAt the center of her pursuits, Eckert remains committed to the mission of advocacy for women, working with creativity, and sharing her expertise in order to help others achieve their goals. So far, The Pinkubator and The Pink Ceiling have invested over $37 million in woman-led companies that, “put power in women’s hands.” Eckert was called, “a tireless force of nature,” by Fortune, and has been featured in Entrepreneur, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Forbes, TEDx, and other national media outlets and publications.\n\nEckert holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Marymount University.\n\nNASA Astronaut\n\nCommencement Speaker\n\nWhen Christina Hammock Koch returned to Earth earlier this year after completing three expeditions on the International Space Station, she made history.\n\nThe NC State alumna and NASA astronaut set the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with a total of 328 days in space. Along with fellow NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, she participated in the first all-woman spacewalk.\n\nIn total during her time in space, she completed six spacewalks that added up to 42 hours and 15 minutes. The crews she served on contributed to hundreds of scientific experiments, according to NASA. Some of the highlights from her missions include improvements to a scientific instrument called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which can detect dark matter, and growing protein crystals for pharmaceutical research.\n\nA native of Michigan who grew up in Jacksonville, N.C., Koch is a three-time graduate of NC State. She graduated in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering, and earned a Bachelor of Science in physics and a Master of Science in electrical engineering in 2002.\n\nKoch was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 2013, and completed astronaut candidate training in 2015.

He co-founded the nonprofit Aerial Futures which has convened global symposia on transportation design.\n\nNASA engineer and executive\n\nCommencement Speaker\n\nNorth Carolina native Dr. Christine Mann Darden is an internationally recognized expert in high-speed aerodynamics and sonic-boom research. Over her nearly 40-year career with NASA, she won dozens of honors, including two NASA medals: one for her work and leadership of the sonic boom program and one for her active involvement in encouraging students to pursue careers in math and science. She received the Black Engineer of the Year Outstanding Achievement in Government Award, and the Women in Science and Engineering Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nDarden is mentioned in the 2016 book “Hidden Figures” as a person who stood on the shoulders of African American women who contributed to the space program in the early 1960s as members of NASA’s segregated West Computers unit. A native of Monroe, North Carolina, Darden graduated from Allen High School, a boarding school in Asheville. She attended Hampton Institute (now University) on scholarship, earning an undergraduate degree in mathematics education. She made a career switch from high school math teacher to engineer after earning a master’s degree in applied mathematics from Virginia State and a doctorate in mechanical engineering from George Washington University.\n\nDarden was hired in 1967 as a computer/data analyst in the re-entry physics branch of NASA’s Langley Research Center. She was later promoted into an engineering position, spending 30 years spearheading research on ways to minimize sonic booms, a barrier to supersonic air travel, which could significantly reduce flight times. Just this year, NASA signed a contract with Lockheed Martin Palmdale to build a full-size supersonic low-boom X-plane to demonstrate low-boom performance and supersonic efficiency – a continuation of work Darden led and performed. She authored 57 technical articles, focusing on sonic-boom prediction and minimization, and supersonic wing design.\n\nDarden became the first African American woman at NASA’s Langley Research Center to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank of the federal civil service. She held a number of high-profile leadership roles with NASA, serving as a senior program manager in the High Speed Research Program Office, director of the Aero Performing Center Program Management Office, and as Langley’s assistant director for planning. She retired from her final position as director of Langley’s Office of Strategic Communication and Education in 2007.\n\nDarden and her husband of 55 years, Walter, are the parents of three adult daughters, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\nMasahiro Shima is the founder and chairman of the board of directors of Shima Seiki Manufacturing Limited, known for its innovations in flat knitting machines. Shima, nicknamed the “Edison of Wakayama,” his hometown in Japan, holds numerous patents.\n\nHe founded the Shima Seiki in 1962, based on development of the world’s first fully automated glove knitting machine. The company’s advances in seamless knitting led to development of the Wholegarment computerized knitting technology the company is known for around the world. The technology allows garment makers to create seamless clothing, from pleated skirts to running shoes, in minutes rather the hours or days once needed to manufacture them, reducing production time. Companies from casual wear manufacturer Uniqlo to designers such as Prada and Giorgio Armani use Wholegarment technology for their fashion lines. The Wholegarment method conserves resources and energy and reduces labor costs.\n\nShima Seiki has become a leader in computerized glove and flat knitting systems and in computerized graphic design, serving 90 countries worldwide. Now chairman of the board, Shima served as president of the company for 55 years before his son succeeded him in that role in June.\n\nShima has served as director of the Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation, vice chairman of the Japan Textile Machinery Association, and as chairman of the Wakayama Machinery and Metal Industrial Cooperative, Wakayama Institute of Invention and Innovation, and Wakayama Industry Promotion Foundation.\n\nHe has received numerous awards for textile engineering, green development and service.

She took on the role in July 2014 following presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.\n\nHoward has served at sea since 1982. Her initial tours were aboard the USS Hunley and USS Lexington. While serving on board Lexington, she received the Secretary of the Navy/Navy League Captain Winifred Collins Award, presented annually to a female officer who demonstrates outstanding leadership.\n\nShe reported to USS Mount Hood as chief engineer in 1990 and served in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. She assumed duties as first lieutenant of the USS Flint in 1992. In 1996 she became executive officer of USS Tortuga and deployed to the Adriatic in support of Operation Joint Endeavor, a peacekeeping effort in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. Following that, Tortuga departed on a West African training mission in which sailors, U.S. Marines and Coast Guard personnel operated with naval services of seven African nations.\n\nIn 1999 Howard became the first African American woman to command a U.S. Navy ship, USS Rushmore, a Whidbey Island-class dock landing ship. She commanded Amphibious Squadron Seven from May 2004 to September 2005. Deployments included Indonesia tsunami relief efforts and maritime security operations in the North Arabian Gulf. She led Expeditionary Strike Group Two from April 2009 to July 2010 and commanded a multinational counter-piracy task force in 2009.\n\nIn July 2014, Howard became the first woman to earn the rank of four-star admiral in the U.S. Navy, as well as the first African American woman to attain four-star rank in any service. She was promoted to that rank when she became 38th vice chief of naval operations.\n\nHoward was named the 2011 USO Military Woman of the Year, the 2013 NAACP Chairman’s Image Award recipient and the 2014 Thurgood Marshall College Fund National Hero Award recipient.\n\nOriginally from Aurora, Colorado, Howard is a 1982 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.

Wheeler was named director in 1994, the North Carolina Museum of Art has become one of the leading art museums in the South. The NCMA’s major exhibitions, featuring the work of Rodin, Rembrandt and Monet, have attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the nation and around the world.\n\nPrior to joining the NCMA, Wheeler was director of development at the Cleveland Museum of Art from 1985 to 1994. From 1977 to 1985, he served as deputy secretary for the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, where he oversaw construction of the original NCMA building.\n\nIn 2006, under Wheeler’s leadership, the museum unveiled its design for an ambitious expansion. His vision for a spacious, light-filled structure to house the museum’s collection became a reality in 2010. Today the award-winning West Building, surrounded by sculpture gardens and reflecting pools, exhibits works from the institution’s outstanding permanent collection of more than 5,000 objects from ancient Egypt to the present day. The expansion also transformed the museum’s original building into a center for temporary exhibitions, collections management and education.\n\nWheeler secured a gift of 29 Rodin sculptures from the Cantor Foundation, making the NCMA the largest repository of Rodin’s work in the South. He has helped build the modern and contemporary collections substantially, including a gift of masters of mid- to late-20th century American art from the private collection of Jim and Mary Patton.\n\nWheeler’s awards include France’s Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters, the Medal of Arts from the City of Raleigh, the Leadership Award from Triangle Business Journal, the Design Guild Award from NC State’s College of Design, and the Thad Eure Memorial Award from the Greater Raleigh Convention and Visitors Bureau. The News & Observer named Wheeler the 2000 Tar Heel of the Year by. In 2010, he received the inaugural Mary D.B.T. Semans Award for Distinguished Service from Duke University’s Nasher Museum of Art.\n\nWheeler grew up in Lakeland, Florida. He holds bachelor’s degrees in history and French from Pfeiffer College. His master’s and doctorate in European history are from the University of Georgia\n\nMIT Professor Mildred Dresselhaus is nicknamed the “queen of carbon.” Her groundbreaking research laid the foundation for carbon science and carbon nanostructures, as well as nanoscience and nanotechnology more generally. She’s also one of the scientists responsible for a resurgence in thermoelectrics research.\n\nA native of the Bronx, Dresselhaus attended New York City public schools through junior high school before earning a scholarship to prestigious Hunter College High School, where she took a physics course and met lifelong mentor Rosalyn Yalow. Dresselhaus completed a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, where she studied with Enrico Fermi and became acquainted with his family. She completed postdoctoral work at Cornell University, where her experiments led to a fundamental understanding of the electronic structure of semi-metals, especially graphite. She became an MIT faculty member and eventually an Institute Professor in the departments of physics and electrical engineering.\n\nA member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, Dresselhaus is the co-author of eight books and about 1,700 papers, primarily on carbon sciences. She is particularly well-known for her work on carbon nanomaterials and other nanostructural systems based on layered materials, like graphene, and more recently, transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene. Her research over the years has covered a wide range of problems in condensed matter and materials physics.\n\nDresselhaus has served as director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and as an officer in national organizations for physics, engineering and related fields. Dresselhaus’ honors include the National Medal of Science, the Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service, the Compton Award, the Fermi Prize, the Kavli Prize and the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nDresselhaus remains active in promoting women’s participation in science and engineering. She enjoys playing violin and viola in chamber music groups, along with spending time with her husband, four children and five grandchildren.\n\nHonorary Doctor of Sciences\n\nEvery day, children gather around the “Window on Animal Health” at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences to watch veterinarians and NCSU vet-terns tend to creatures from rattlesnakes to rabbits. As the presentation ends, it’s not uncommon to hear a youngster declare, “I want to be an animal doctor.” That scene plays out throughout the museum, as tomorrow’s leaders dream of discovering dinosaur fossils or uncharted stars after taking in an exhibit, seeing a scientist’s dazzling display or doing a hands-on experiment.\n\nThis is Dr. Betsy Bennett’s vision fulfilled – a place for visitors of all ages to become actively involved in science and nature. Children get a jump start on the sometimes mystifying or intimidating subjects that will be essential to their future success, and they have a lot of fun doing it.\n\nBennett retired in 2012 after more than two decades as the museum’s director, transforming it from exhibit space in a cramped state office building into a pioneering institution now being replicated worldwide. She altered the Raleigh skyline – twice – and created a global destination that will inspire generations. To get there she snared dinosaurs, recruited world-class scientists, won over legislators and enlisted a platoon of CEOs. Former Gov. Jim Hunt dubbed her “a force of nature.”\n\nSuch accolades are a long way from the postwar Alabama schoolgirl who found a love of nature on butterfly walks with her mother. The only physics major at all-female Hollins University, she excelled in the male-dominated worlds of science and politics. She earned a doctorate in science education at the University of Virginia and was elected to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board in the 1970s, helping craft an integration and pupil assignment plan in a tense and divisive era.\n\nBennett, named Tar Heel of the Year in 2011 by the News & Observer, is a past president of the Association of Science Museum Directors.

Sanchez is an internationally known expert on managing tropical soils for increased food production while conserving the environment. Sanchez is senior research scholar and director of the Agriculture and Food Security Center at Columbia University’s Earth Institute.\n\nSanchez is the 2002 World Food Prize laureate and a 2004 MacArthur Fellow. He attributes the roots of his life’s work in soil science to the fact that he always liked to “play with dirt.” That boyhood pastime was nurtured by the fact that his family owned a diversified farm, the distributorship of Chilean nitrates in Cuba and a fertilizer blending plant, and it eventually led Sanchez to become a world-renowned soil scientist. He earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in soil science from Cornell University.\n\nAfter his undergraduate education at Cornell University, where he took particularly influential seminars on starvation in India, Sanchez headed to the Philippines as a graduate student in tropical soils, becoming what he calls “a foot soldier in the Green Revolution,” working on rice.\n\nSanchez is pleased that what he saw happen in the Green Revolution in Asia in the 1970s is beginning to happen in Africa. He served as director general of the World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF) headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, from 1991 to 2001, as co-chair of the United Nations Millennium Project Hunger Task Force from 2002 to 2005 and as director of the Millennium Villages Project from 2004 to 2010. He is committed to making Africa “get out of hunger” in the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nSanchez is professor emeritus of soil science and forestry at NC State. A faculty member from 1968 to 1991, he served as the first professor of tropical soils and led the Tropical Soils Research Program. He has lived in the Philippines, Peru, Colombia and Kenya, and supervised research programs in more than 25 countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa.

He served as Fellow of Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge from 1992 to 2003. Badger previously taught at Newcastle University for 20 years. He was educated at Cambridge, North Carolina State and Hull universities.\n\nBadger has written extensively about the New Deal and the post-1945 American South. His first two books had a North Carolina focus: Prosperity Road: The New Deal, Tobacco, and North Carolina and North Carolina and the New Deal. He subsequently wrote The New Deal: The Depression Years and New Deal/New South: The Anthony J Badger Reader. In 1997, he gave the Harrelson Lecture at North Carolina State. He has served as an editor for several books on American political history and the civil rights movement.\n\nHis latest book, FDR: The First Hundred Days, was chosen as then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s book of the year in 2008.

The memorial and the scholarships were funded by donations from the British public as a tribute to President Kennedy.\n\nIn 2011 the British foreign secretary appointed Badger to oversee the transfer of the migrated colonial archive from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the National Archives. The existence of this archive of files sent to London by British colonial governments before independence had been kept secret for 50 years.\n\nBadger, who has served multiple terms on the University Council at Cambridge, also led the university’s Colleges Committee and Cambridge Assessment. He chaired a search committee in 2002 that led to the nomination of Yale Provost Alison Richard as the first “outsider” to lead Cambridge.\n\nHonorary Doctor of Humane Letters\n\nHonorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree: Hayden White is a literary critic and historical theorist whose name appears on a landmark California Supreme Court case as well as his many books. At age 85, he has only recently retired from teaching as a professor of comparative literature at Stanford University. He is professor emeritus of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nIn works such as Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth Century Europe, White has argued that literary and historical writing share a reliance on storytelling form, meaning that no history can be considered completely objective or scientific. However, he also holds that this reliance on the narrative structure allows history to be meaningful. His latest volume, titled The Practical Past, will be released in 2014.\n\nBorn in Tennessee, White grew up in Detroit during the Depression. He earned an undergraduate degree in history from Wayne State University and completed his doctorate at the University of Michigan. He spent two years in Italy in the 1950s on a Fulbright Fellowship completing his dissertation research on medieval church history.\n\nWhite has also taught at Wayne State, the University of Rochester, UCLA and Wesleyan University. He has received grants, fellowships and awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim Foundation and many other prestigious organizations. He held residential fellowships at Cornell, Wesleyan, the Harvard Center for Renaissance Studies in Florence, Stanford, the American Academy in Berlin and the University of Bologna, Italy.\n\nPerhaps his proudest accomplishment is having served as plaintiff in a class-action civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department during the Vietnam era. In 1973 while a history professor at UCLA, White brought suit against the chief of police, alleging covert intelligence gathering tactics that included having officers register as students, take notes on anti-Vietnam class discussions and make police reports based on the discussions. The California Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in White’s favor in 1975. The case, White versus Davis, established limits on police surveillance of political activity in California, barring it in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nWhite’s teaching philosophy holds that the aim of education should be to help young people think their own thoughts and speak in their own voices, rather than fit themselves into pre- established patterns of behavior and belief prescribed by society, the business world or the legal establishment. He is married to Margaret Brose, professor emerita of literature at the University of California at Santa Cru\n\nHonorary Doctor of Sciences Degree\n\nRobert B.
