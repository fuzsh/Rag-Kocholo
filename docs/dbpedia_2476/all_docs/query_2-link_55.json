        "text": "All The King's Men\n\nBuy All the King's Men - 1949\n\nMERCEDES MCCAMBRIDGE, JOHN IRELAND, JOANNE DRU, JOHN DEREK, ANN SEYMOUR\n\n- Oscars all round – for Best Picture, for Broderick Crawford as politician Willie Stark, and for the magnificent Mercedes McCambridge, making her screen debut. The initially idealistic, working-class Stark follows the dangerous road of real politik as he rises to become governor of an un-named Southern state, and is ultimately assassinated. R film à clef based on the career of Louisiana Governor Huey P Long.\n\nFilmed entirely in Stockton, using the Hotel Stockton, the old county courthouse (amassing hundreds of Stocktonians for a nighttime political rally scene), the old city jail, Atherton Island, the McLeod Lake lawn across from City Hall, the Stockton waterfront, Lower Sacramento Road near the old Henderson School in Lodi, on the north steps of Stockton City Hall (where a floodlit assassination scene ends the movie) and at other area locations, including two in Rio Vista; Fred Babitzke of Stockton played a waiter in a restaurant scene; young Derek was fresh off his breakthrough film earlier that year,\n\nAlthough seemingly set in the South, it was filmed largely on location around Stockton, east of San Francisco in northern California. After being elected governor, Willie Stark makes his victory speech from the balcony of the Hotel Stockton, 133 East Weber Avenue between North El Dorado Street and North Hunter Street.\n\nIt closed as a hotel in 1960 and, now on the register of historic places, has been renovated as private apartments. North on El Dorado is City Hall, Civic Court at North El Dorado Street, on the steps of which Stark is finally gunned down.\n\nAlways\n\nBuy Always - 1989\n\nConsidered by many to represent a low point in Steven Spielberg's career, 1990's Always did suggest something of a temporary drift in the director's sensibility. A remake of the classic Spencer Tracy film A Guy Named Joe, Always stars Richard Dreyfuss as a Forest Service pilot who takes great risks with his own life to douse wildfires from a plane. After promising his frightened fiancée (Holly Hunter) to keep his feet on the ground and go into teaching, Dreyfuss's character is killed during one last flight. But his spirit wanders restlessly, hopelessly attached to and possessive of Hunter, who can't see or hear him. Then the real conflict begins: a trainee pilot (Brad Johnson), a likable doofus, begins wooing a not-unappreciative Hunter--and it becomes Dreyfuss's heavenly mandate to accept, and even assist in, their budding romance. The trouble with the film is a certain airlessness, a hyper-inventiveness in every scene and sequence that screams of Spielberg's self-education in Hollywood classicism. Unlike the masters he is constantly quoting and emulating in Always, he forgets to back off and let the movie breathe on its own sometimes, which would better serve his clockwork orchestration of suspense and comedy elsewhere. Still, there are lovely passages in this film, such as the unforgettable look on Dreyfuss's face a half-second before fate claims him. John Goodman contributes good supporting work, and Audrey Hepburn makes her final screen appearance as an angel.\n\nBuy Almost Famous - 2000\n\nBILLY CRUDUP, FRANCES MCDORMAND, KATE HUDSON, JASON LEE, FAIRUZA BALK, ANNA PAQUIN, PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN, PATRICK FUGIT, BIJOU PHILLIPS\n\nWritten, produced and directed by Cameron Crowe (“Jerry Maguire”), a semi-autobiographical account of his teenage years as a rock music reporter for Rolling Stone; nominee and winner of numerous national and international awards, including three Academy Award nominations, (Crowe won for Best Original Screenplay and Goldie Hawn’s daughter, Kate Hudson, was nominated for Best Supporting Actress); with Oscar-winners McDormand (“Fargo”) and Paquin (“The Piano”) and featuring former Stocktonian Balk, granddaughter of Stockton dance teacher LaVern Balk; Crudup was in “Inventing the Abbotts,” shot in Stockton in 1997; scenes filmed in Rio Vista and on a rural road near Lincoln in Placer County, substituting for the midwest, in which the Stillwater Band is traveling by bus and passes a barn built just for the shot.\n\nAtlanta Child Murders\n\nBuy The Atlanta Child Murders - 1985\n\nBetween the summer of 1979 and the spring of 1981, 29 African American children, adolescents and adults were murdered in Atlanta, Georgia. The killings gained nationwide attention, with many suspecting that they were the work of the Ku Klux Klan or a similar white supremacist group. However, in June 1981, a 23-year-old African American named Wayne Williams (Levels) was arrested for first-degree murder in the deaths of 27-year-old Nathaniel Carter and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne. Eight months later, Williams was convicted of both killings and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment. Some parties speculate that Williams was not the real killer, and that local law enforcement officials used him as a scapegoat to bring a seemingly unsolvable case to a close. However, it is generally presumed that Williams was the culprit in most of the murders, if not all of them. No one was ever tried in connection with the other killings.\n\nBuy Back To The Future PART III - 1990\n\nMICHAEL J FOX, CHRISTOPHER LLOYD, MARY STEENBURGEN, LEA THOMPSON, ELISABETH SHUE, RICHARD DYSART, DUB TAYLOR, HARRY CAREY JR, PAT BUTTRAM\n\nThird and final family comedy about the time-traveling teenager whose fooling around in the past threatens his future, directed by Steven Spielberg acolyte Robert Zemeckis before he won the Academy Award for “Forrest Gump” in 1994 and directed “Contact” in 1997; a key location near Sonora in Tuolumne County, the 1885 version of the town of Hill Valley, was constructed west of Chinese Camp, the entrance to it about a mile off Highway 108 down the hill from O’Byrne’s Ferry Road; “Unforgiven” and “Bad Girls,” also shot in the Sierra foothills, used some of the same town sets (a 1996 grass fire caused by lightning burned several acres and the Hill Valley set); John Himle of Stockton was in the cast; Carey also made “The Moonshine War” in 1970 and “Nickelodeon” in 1976 on location in Stockton.\n\nBad Girls 1994\n\nBuy Bad Girls - 1994\n\nMADELEINE STOWE, MARY STUART MASTERSON, ANDIE MACDOWELL, DREW BARRYMORE, ROBERT LOGGIA, DERMOT MULRONEY\n\nFour prostitutes join together as the “Honky-Tonk Harlots” to travel the Old West, recover their stolen money and put the pursuing Pinkertons in their place, directed by Jonathan Kaplan and filmed in the Sierra foothills, at the Red Hills Ranch near Sonora and in a town set originally built for “Back to the Future, Part III” and later used in the Clint Eastwood western “Unforgiven”; Loggia was in “Raid on Entebbe,” shot in Stockton in 1977; in the cast were Stocktonians Robert Gossett, John Himle and the Stockton-born actress and University of the Pacific graduate Beulah Quo, playing a Chinese herbalist, whom Kaplan also would cast in “Brokedown Palace” in 1999; among many other films, Quo has appeared in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,” “The Sand Pebbles,” “MacArthur” and the award-winning “Chinatown”;’ her considerable career on stage, screen and television was honored by the City of Stockton when the Stockton Arts Commission (assisted by Quo’s Stockton cousin Gladys Mar) presented its Career Achievement Award to her in 1986.\n\nThe Big Country\n\nBuy The Big Country - 1958\n\nGREGORY PECK, CHARLTON HESTON, JEAN SIMMONS, CARROLL BAKER, BURL IVES, CHARLES BICKFORD, CHUCK CONNORS, ALFONSO BEDOY\n\nA Grandly high-styled psychological western about two feuding families, an epic melodrama adapted for the screen by novelist Jessamyn West, who wrote “Friendly Persuasion” and directed by the multi Oscar-winning William Wyler, who also directed the film version of “Friendly Persuasion” and a 1930 film shot in Tuolumne County, “The Storm,” written by John Huston, who would film “Fat City” here in 1972; the cast and crew almost entirely occupied the Hotel Stockton, which became a magnet for autograph-seekers and the press.\n\nHeston jokingly signed his signature as Charlton “Moses” Heston, and to a fan’s “Hey, Chuck!” as he and two others left the hotel bar, Heston shouted back “Which Chuck? There’s three of us here!” (he, Bickford and Connors); first of three films Connors made in Stockton (“The Name of the Game,” “The Vals”).\n\nSome scenes shot in the Sierra foothills and many in the Farmington area, where a hotel, livery stable and house (Simmon’s home in the movie) were built and later purchased by Pollardville as attractions at its Tule Flats Ghost Town in Stockton (the hotel building bears a plaque stating its movie origin); Ives, who won Academy and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actor for ”The Big Country,” was the balladeer, storyteller and folksinger who became a vivid character actor in two films, including the coarse Big Daddy in Tennessee Williams’ “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” on stage and screen; Bedoya, in a rare sympathetic turn, is remembered for his braggadocio as the Mexican bandit in John Huston’s “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre”: “Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges!”\n\nBuy The Big Valley - 1965-1969\n\nBARBARA STANWYCK, RICHARD LONG, PETER BRECK, LEE MAJORS, LINDA EVANS, DOUGLAS KENNEDY\n\nThe Big Valley is an American western television series which ran on ABC from September 15, 1965, to May 19, 1969. The show stars Barbara Stanwyck, as the widow of a wealthy nineteenth century California rancher. It was created by A.I. Bezzerides and Louis F. Edelman, and produced by Levy-Gardner-Laven for Four Star Television.\n\nSet on a Stockton ranch and about fictional Stocktonians, with a title that spawned the names of local insurance, automobile and other business enterprises, including Big Valley Cablevision, this television series that ran through 1969 was never made in Stockton.\n\nThe TV series was based loosely on the Hill Ranch, which was located at the western edge of Calaveras County, not far from Stockton. One episode placed the Barkley Ranch a few hours' ride from town, while another has Jarrod riding past a Calaveras County sign on his way to the TV series' ranch. The Hill Ranch existed from 1855 until 1931, including almost 30,000 acres; and the Mokelumne River ran through it. The source is from an episode in which Heath is on trial in a ghost town with another man (played by Leslie Nielsen) and tells the judge how much land they have. Lawson Hill ran the ranch until he was murdered in 1861. His wife Euphemia (aka \"Auntie Hill\") then became the matriarch. During their marriage they had four children, one daughter and three sons. Today, the location of the ranch is covered by the waters of Lake Camanche. A California state historical marker standing at Camanche South Shore Park mentions the historic ranch. The set used to film the exterior of the Barkley Mansion stood on the backlot of Republic Studios from 1947 until 1975.\n\nBuy Blood Alley - 1955\n\nJOHN WAYNE, LAUREN BA CALL, ANITA EKBERG, MIKE MAZURKI\n\nAction—adventure about refugees fleeing the Communist takeover of China; produced and directed by Wayne (uncredited) and his hard-drinking old friend William A. Wellman\n\nFilmed in the San Joaquin Delta and on its rivers, one serving as the Yangtze; different kinds of epics, “War and Peace” and “La Dolce Vita,” were just ahead for Swedish import Ekberg; Mazurki, a former Russian wrestler who had bit parts in dozens of Hollywood films, would later appear in three directed by John Ford, who made Will Rogers’ next-to-last film in Stockton in 1934; cast and crew stayed at the Hotel Stockton, where Bacall kept to herself, her room and her new husband, Humphrey Bogart, who stayed with her during most of the shoot; Wayne, Wellman and the brawny Mazurki, however, spent time eating, drinking and playing poker at Chet’s on Wilson Way, site of a minor dustup that drew police after the “Duke” decked a bartender for making rude remarks about him meant for all to hear; when Wayne returned to it, after shooting all day on the Delta, he would still sign autographs for fans, once up to 400 kids, waiting for him there; he made the Virginia S, an 86-foot Geodetic Survey boat owned by Tom Case, his social and production headquarters while in Stockton.\n\nBuy Bound for Glory - 1976\n\nHal Ashby (The Last Detail, Being There) directed this lyrical and affecting 1976 biography of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie. David Carradine gives a powerful performance as the traveling Depression-era vagabond whose music affected generations. Guthrie is portrayed as an earnest soul whose passion and empathy for the working class spurs him to inspirational heights. Ronny Cox (Deliverance, Beverly Hills Cop) plays a union organizer who sees the value in Guthrie's words and music and persuades him to put his music to good use for the people struggling to earn a living wage. Featuring Melinda Dillon as Guthrie's wife, this easygoing travelogue conveys an authentic sense of period Americana and won Academy Awards for Haskell Wexler's cinematography as well as for the score based on Guthrie's own music. Bound for Glory is an important film to see for anyone in love with the origins of folk music and interested in its place in the 20th century.\n\nBuy The Candidate - 1972\n\nROBERT REDFORD, PETER BOYLE, MEL WN DOUGLAS, ALLEN GARFIELD, DON PORTER, KENNETH TOBEY\n\nRedford, as the son of Ca|ifornia’s governor, tweaks the establishment, gets himself elected senator and, looking into the camera, has the film’s provacotive closing line: “Well, what do we do now?”; an often overlooked satire directed by Michael Ritchie from an original Oscar-winning screenplay by Jeremy Larner; Douglas had won his Academy Award (“Hud”) and Redford was later to win for directing Best Picture “Ordinary People,” which produced an Oscar nomination for Timothy Hutton, who in 1979 made “Friendly Fire” in Stockton just before winning it; first of two films (“The Candidate” in 1974) made here by Tobey, the hero of the Howard Hughes’ original scifi classic “The Thing”; featuring the voices of Broderick Crawford and Barry Sullivan and, playing themselves, actress Natalie Wood (who made “Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! near Twain Harte in 1948 and “The Great Race” near Jamestown in 1965), media mavens Van Amberg, Mike Wallace and Howard K Smith, and such state and national political figures of the day as senators Alan Cranston, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern and John Tunney, Terence McGovern, Sam Yorty and Jesse Unruh, some of them appearing in a major political rally and parade sequence shot along 11th Street in Tracy using the actual Tracy High School Homecoming Parade, the school’s marching band and hundreds of Tracyites as extras.\n\nBuy Come Next Spring COME NEXT SPRING - 1956\n\nANN SHERIDAN, STEVE COCHCRAN, WALTER BRENNAN, EDGAR BUCHANAN, SONNY TUFTS, RICHARD EYER, SHERRY JACKSON Domestic drama about an ex-alcoholic husband who tries to win the respect of the family he abandoned, produced by Cochran, whose daughter now lives in Stockton, and directed by R.G.

Kennedy won the Golden Globe and Academy awards for Best Supporting Actor; Oscar nominations also went to Newman, who has a memorable egg-eating scene, and Jo Van Fleet, already a 1955 winner for playing the mother of Davalos and James Dean in “East of Eden”;

Huston almost fired him because he was late every morning to the set; Hall’s cinematography for the film, one of three he shot in Stockton, was highly praised by critics.\n\nBuy Flubber - 1997\n\nROBIN WILLIAMS, MARCIA GAY HARDEN, TED LEVINE, DAKIN MATHEWS, WIL WHEATON\n\nAbsent-minded professor Williams discovers a super-bouncy substance in this wacky comedy\n\nThe film took place in and around the historic university. (Rumor has it, at Halloween residents give out green bouncy balls.) Although the film renamed the university Medfield College, the beautiful exterior shots reveal that the school’s grounds and architecture were left exactly as they were. When you’re on campus, see if any staff or alumni are there who were in the movie. They’d surely be glad to point out all the scenes where students and staff were used as extras!\n\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls\n\nBuy For Whom The Bell Tolls - 1934\n\nGARY COOPER, INGRID BERGMAN, AKIM TAMIROFF, KATINA PAXINOU, ARTURO DE CORDOVA, JOSEPH CALLEIA, FEODOR CHALIAPIN, GEORGE COULOURIS\n\nErnest Hemingway’s best-selling account of passion and patriotism during the Spanish Civil War, scripted by Dudley Nichols and directed by Sam Wood in the Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills around Sonora, with a scene-stealing production design by William Cameron Menzies; first of two films (“Then Came Bronson” in 1969) that Tamiroff would make in the Stockton area; although it has not held up, it did earn nine Academy Award nominations and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Paxinou; Cooper was never more subdued than here, but the “earth moved” for the miscast Bergman, whose short-cropped hair created a sensation; Yvonne De Carlo, debuting in an uncredited bit as a café girl, would later do humdrum movies, “The Addams Family” television series and, years later, hit an unexpected career high singing Stephen Sondheim’s tribute to showbiz longevity, “|’m Still Here,” in his perfect Broadway musical, “Follies.”\n\nBuy The Gold Rush - 1925\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN, MACK SWAIN, TOM MURRAY, GEORGIA HALE, HENRY BERGMAN\n\nThe classic silent comedy set in the Yukon Gold Rush, written, produced, edited, directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, who also wrote the music.

Merrill made “Winged Victory” in Stockton in 1947, Parks made his film debut here in “The Wild Seed” in 1965, and Sheen played opposite his son Charlie in “Hot Shots, Part Deux” in 1993; Tamiroff appeared in “For Whom the Bells To||,” shot in the Sierra foothills in 1943; excellent character actors like Tamiroff and Freed always work (Freed was in some of Hollywood’s best movies, among them “Boomerang!” “No Way Out,” “Detective Story,” “The Desperate Hours,” “Paths of Glory,” “The Goddess,” “Shane” and “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?”) before working on “Bronson” in Stockton; Bedelia later played Harrison Ford's deceived wife in “Presumed |nnocent.”\n\nUNFORGIVEN - 1992\n\nCLINT EASTWOOD, GENE HACKMAN, MORGAN FREEMAN, RICHARD HARRIS\n\nA widower gunslinger who has settled down hires on a final risky job and lives to regret it; Producer-Director Eastwood scored nine Academy Award nominations and nailed four Oscars, including two for himself as Best Director and for Best Picture (Hackman won for Best Supporting Actor and the film for Best Editing); Eastwood also composed “Claudia’s Theme” heard throughout the score; the film, which won many other awards, was made in Alberta, Canada, except for a scene in Atlanta and one crucial scene shot around the water tower, in a town set originally built west of Chinese Camp for “Back to the Future, Part III” and used later in “Bad Girls” at the Keystone Ranch off Highway 108 down the hill from O’Byrne’s Ferry Road in Tuolumne County; when Eastwood directed “Bird” in the Chinese community of Locke in 1988 on the San Joaquin Delta, he and his company stayed at The Stockton Hilton’; in 1982 he had directed himself and his son in “Honktytonk Man” in the Sierra foothills..\n\nTHE WILD SEED - 1965\n\nMICHAEL PARKS, CELIA KAYE, ROSS ELLIOTT\n\nRoutine melodrama about a girl’s romance with a drifter, directed by Brian Hutton; debut film of Parks and, more importantly, the debut of the innovative cinematographer Conrad Hall, whose later work (“American Beauty,” “Road to Perdition”) achieved career heights with two other films shot in Stockton, “Cool Hand Luke” and “Fat City,” the latter directed by John Huston, who later cast Parks as a fig—leafed Adam in his film of stories from “The Bible”; after “The Wild Seed” the Golden Globes named Kaye the “Most Promising Newcomer” (along with Mia Farrow) of that year, but she made only five more movies, “Vampire at Midnight” the last in 1988; Elliott, who later was in “The Towering Inferno,” began his career with Orson Welles’ Mercury Theatre and its startling radio production of “The War of the Worlds”; with Carl Parker of Stockton in a supporting role.\n\nWINGED VICTORY - 1943\n\nLON MCALLISTER, PETER LIND HA YES, DON TAYLOR, GARY MERRILL, BARRY NELSON, GEORGE (\"Superman\") REEVES, KEVIN MCCARTHY, tenor MARIO LANZA, future Academy Award winners JUDY HOLLIDAY, EDMOND O’BRIEN, LEE J COBB, JEANNE CRAIN, RED BUTTONS, KARL MALDEN, MARTIN RITT\n\nWartime drama about training army air force crews, directed by George Cukor from a script by Moss Hart, who later would produce “My Fair Lady” on Broadway (Cukor would direct it on film); astonishing for its large cast of unknown actors, most making their film debuts or beginning major stage and screen careers; filmed entirely at the Stockton Field Training Base of the United States Army Air Corps; first of two films (“Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!” in 1948) that McCallister would make in the Stockton area; Merrill would make “Twelve O’CIock High” in 1949, ‘‘All About Eve” in 1950, marry its star, Bette Davis, and soon began a slow career decline that returned him to Stockton in a minor role in a 1969 pilot for a television series, “Then Came Bronson”; blacklisted in the 1950s, Ritt would later win an Oscar and a Venice Film Festival prize for directing “Hud” in 1964 and a Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize for directing “Norma Rae” in 1979\n\nBuy the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles - 1992\n\nSEAN PATRICK HARRIS, COREY CARRIER, GEORGE HALL, RONNY COUTTEURE\n\nScenes for two episodes of the critically acclaimed and thus short-lived television series, both set in 1917, produced by George Lucas and based on the youthful Indiana Jones character of the later film trilogy directed by Steven Spielberg: “Barcelona,” directed by Terry Ross and written by Gavin Scott, used part of the Stockton Deep Water Channel near Happy Harbor northwest of Stockton as the harbor of the Spanish city; and “Congo,” directed by Simon Wincer and written by Frank Darabont (writer of the fourth Indiana Jones film that Lucas will produce and Spielberg direct for release in 2005), used part of the nearby Venice Cut as the Congo River for a scene in which rebels run along the shore firing rifles at a Delta boat; one of five films that Harris made in 2002 was “Borderline” with Michael Biehn, who starred in “Rampage” in Stockton in 1988; Lucas and Spielberg previously had used Stockton locations for the older Indiana Jones chronicles, “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1982 and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” in 1984."
