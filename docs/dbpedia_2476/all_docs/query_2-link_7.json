From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters.\n\nHe made his debut as a quarryman in Das Feld (1990).

He is one of Canada's most popular actors and frequently appears in films by Canadian directors Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg. It was Cronenberg's controversial movie Crash (1996) that had Cannes all abuzz in 1996. Elias played Vaughan, a self-appointed \"mad scientist\" with an unusual fetish--sexual delight in car crashes! The past two years have been busy ones for Koteas, adding six more roles to his resume. As Capt. James Staros, the commanding officer of Charlie Company in Der schmale Grat (1998), he brought sensitivity and compassion to his portrayal of a man who cared about the safety of his men--even at the risk of his own career. In 2000 he appeared in Lost Souls - Verlorene Seelen (2000), a thriller starring Winona Ryder, and starred on Broadway with Josh Brolin in the Sam Shepard play \"True West.\"\n\nRay Winstone was born on February 19, 1957, in Hackney Hospital in London, England, to Margaret (Richardson) and Raymond J.

He was the son of Marjorie (Percival) and Thomas Wilkinson. Economic hardships forced his family to move to Canada for a few years when Wilkinson was a child; then, after he had returned to England, he attended and graduated from the University of Kent at Canterbury with a degree in English and American Literature.\n\nWilkinson first became active in film and television in the mid-1970s, but did not become familiar to an international audience until 1997. That was when he starred as one of six unemployed workers who strip for cash in Best Picture nominee Ganz oder gar nicht (1997), and went on to win a BAFTA for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. That same year, he was featured in Oscar und Lucinda (1997) and Oscar Wilde (1997). Wilkinson was also shown to memorable effect as a theatre financier with acting aspirations in Best Picture winner Shakespeare in Love (1998).\n\nOver the next few years, Wilkinson would become more popular, especially with American audiences, with such roles as General Cornwallis alongside Mel Gibson in the blockbuster Der Patriot (2000) and as the grief-stricken father, Matt Fowler, in the critically acclaimed Best Picture nominee In the Bedroom (2001). For his role in that movie, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nSince then, Wilkinson has made memorable appearances in Vergiss mein nicht (2004), Batman Begins (2005), Der Exorzismus von Emily Rose (2005), Operation Walküre - Das Stauffenberg-Attentat (2008), Duplicity - Gemeinsame Geheimsache (2009), Der Ghostwriter (2010), Eine offene Rechnung (2010) and Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), among others.

Prior to that, Walton starred in the hit series THE SHIELD. He also played key roles in the Quentin Tarantino films DJANGO: UNCHAINED and THE HATEFUL EIGHT as 'Billy Crash' and 'Sheriff Chris Mannix'.\n\nAn oddly fascinating bloke with prominent bony cheeks and rawboned figure, Peter William (Pete) Postlethwaite was born on February 16, 1946 and was a distinguished character actor on stage, TV and film. Growing up the youngest of four siblings in a Catholic family in Warrington, Lancashire (near Liverpool) in middle-class surroundings to working-class parents, he attended St Mary's University (London). However, while completing his studies, he developed an interest in theatre, to the chagrin of his father, who wanted his children to find secure positions in life.\n\nA drama teacher initially at a Catholic girls convent school, he decided to follow his acting instincts full-time and gradually built up an impressive array of classical stage credits via repertory, including the Bristol Old Vic Drama School, and in stints with Liverpool Everyman, Manchester Royal Exchange and the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the 1980s he was ready to branch out into film and TV, giving a startling performance as a wife abuser in the Entfernte Stimmen - Stilleben (1988).\n\nBy 1993 he had crossed over into Hollywood parts and earned his first Oscar nomination for his superb role as Daniel Day-Lewis' father in Im Namen des Vaters (1993). Other quality roles came his way with Die üblichen Verdächtigen (1995), Brassed Off - Mit Pauken und Trompeten (1996), and Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997). He did fine work on television in Die Scharfschützen - 3. Kommando ohne Wiederkehr (1994), Lost for Words (1999), and The Sins (2000). Postlethwaite worked equally both in the UK and abroad, and avoided the public limelight for the most part, except for occasional displays of political activism.\n\nPostlethwaite lived quietly out of the spotlight in England and continued on in films with roles in Schiffsmeldungen (2001), The Limit (2004), Dark Water - Dunkle Wasser (2005), Das Omen (2006), Ghost Son (2007) and Solomon Kane (2009). In 2010, he was seen in Kampf der Titanen (2010), Inception (2010) and The Town - Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).\n\nPostlewaite died on January 2, 2011, at age 64, of pancreatic cancer. He was surrounded by his wife and son, and by his daughter from a prior relationship.\n\nDavid Morse, a 6' 4\" tall blue-eyed blond who performed on stage for 10 years before breaking into film, has become established as a respected supporting, character actor and second lead.\n\nHe was born the first of four children of Charles, a sales manager, and Jacquelyn Morse, a schoolteacher, on October 11, 1953, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He grew up with three younger sisters. After graduating from high school, Morse studied acting at the William Esper Studio. In 1971, he began his professional acting career appearing in over 30 productions with the Boston Repertory Company from 1971 to 1977. In the late 1970s, Morse continued his stage career with the Circle Repertory Company in New York before moving into television and film. In the late 1990s, he returned to the Off-Broadway stage starring in Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize winning drama, \"How I Learned to Drive\" (1997), for which he won the Drama Desk Award and the Obie.\n\nMorse made his big screen debut in 1980 co-starring as \"Jerry Maxwell\", a cheerful bartender turned basketball player, opposite John Savage and Diana Scarwid in Inside Moves (1980), written by Barry Levinson and directed by Richard Donner. Although Inside Moves (1980) was nominated for an Oscar, Morse had to wait a few years until his career took off. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast as Dr. Jack \"Boomer\" Morrison, a young doctor who struggles as a single parent after the death of his wife, in Chefarzt Dr. Westphall (1982), a medical drama that ran for six seasons. He co-starred as opposite Jodie Foster and young Jena Malone in the Oscar nominated Sci-Fi drama Contact (1997). In 1999, he appeared in Stephen King's The Green Mile (1999), with Tom Hanks. A year later, he played a supporting role as a kidnapped husband of Meg Ryan in Lebenszeichen - Proof of Life (2000). In 2002, Morse became the first English-speaking actor nominated for the Golden Horse Award, the Chinese equivalent of the Oscars, for his superb performance as FBI expert \"Kevin Richter\" in Double Vision - Fünf Höllen bis zur Unsterblichkeit (2002). From 2002 to 2004, Morse had a regular gig starring as \"Mike Olshansky\", an ex-Philadelphia policeman turned cab driver, in the TV series Die Straßen von Philadelphia (2002) which ran three seasons and was filmed in Philadelphia, close to his home. In 2006-2007, he has a recurring role on season 3 of an Emmy award-winning medical drama Dr. House (2004).\n\nDavid Morse has been married to fellow actress Susan Wheeler Duff since 1982. They have three children, one daughter and twin sons.

He first became interested in acting after serving three years in the US Air Force and studied at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio. Ward then went to Europe, where he dubbed many Italian movies, and first appeared on-screen in two films by Roberto Rossellini. He then returned to the United States, and got his first decent role alongside Clint Eastwood in the nail-biting prison film Flucht von Alcatraz (1979). Ward's looks often saw him cast as law enforcement or military characters, and he put in noteworthy performances in Die letzten Amerikaner (1981), Die verwegenen Sieben (1983), as astronaut Gus Grissom in Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983) and scored the lead in the interesting spy/martial arts movie Remo - Unbewaffnet Und Gefaehrlich (1985), which unfortunately was not as successful as had been the mega-selling series of Remo Williams books.\n\nHowever, during \"Remo\", Ward demonstrated a great knack for comedic timing and satirical performance, and this ability was used to great effect in several films, including playing Kevin Bacon's fellow giant-worm-fighting handyman in the light-hearted sci-fi hit Tremors - Im Land der Raketenwürmer (1990), as \"Walter Stuckel\" in Robert Altman's The Player (1992), as TV anchorman \"Chip Daley\" in Tim Robbins' razor-sharp political satire Bob Roberts (1992) and as a vicious, but incompetent, gangster menacing Leslie Nielsen in Die nackte Kanone 33 1/3 (1994).\n\nWard's abilities as both a supporting player and truly versatile character actor ensured that he would be in steady demand, and he continued to turn up in a wide variety of roles utilizing his skills. Keep an eye out for Fred Ward in the action-filled The Chaos Factor (2000), as David Spade's dad in Joe Dreck (2001), in the tongue-in-cheek Mr. Undercover (2001) and in the Reese Witherspoon romantic tale Sweet Home Alabama - Liebe auf Umwegen (2002). His last three films were more action-oriented, Armored (2009), [link=tt1622547, and 2 Guns (2013), and he subsequently mostly retired from acting until his death in 2022.\n\nBradley Whitford's credits in film, television and theater include work with some of the most noted writers, directors and playwrights in the arts, and constitute a career worthy of a Juilliard-trained actor -- which he is. But stardom is something else altogether, and it remained elusive, at least until 1999 and his appearance on NBC's acclaimed political drama, The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999).\n\nBradley Whitford was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Genevieve Smith Whitford, a poet and writer, and George Van Norman Whitford. He studied theater and English literature at Wesleyan University and earned a master's degree in theater from the prestigious Juilliard Theater Center. Whitford's first professional performance was in the off-Broadway production of \"Curse of the Starving Class,\" with Kathy Bates. He also starred in the Broadway production of \"The West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" His additional theater credits include \"Three Days of Rain\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club, \"Measure for Measure\" at the Lincoln Center, and the title role in \"Coriolanus\" at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome of Whitford's most memorable performances include roles in such films as Die Muse (1999) with Albert Brooks and Der 200 Jahre Mann (1999) with Robin Williams. He has also appeared in Der Duft der Frauen (1992), Perfect World (1993), Philadelphia (1993), Der Klient (1994), Mein Leben für dich (1993), Red Corner - Labyrinth ohne Ausweg (1997), Aus Mangel an Beweisen (1990), and Ein Präsident für alle Fälle (1996).
