        "text": "The Kansas Board of Regents has announced the appointment of Richard B. Myers ’65 as the 14th president of Kansas State University. Myers has served as the interim president of K-State since April 2016.\n\n“It is with great pleasure that we…make this announcement,” said Zoe Newton, chair of the Kansas Board of Regents. “General Myers is perfectly positioned to bring K-State into the future, but understands as an alumnus the importance of honoring the traditions and history of this great university.”\n\nMyers said he and his wife, Mary Jo Rupp Myers ’64, are excited for this opportunity to serve K-State and support education and research, honoring K-State’s land-grant heritage.\n\n“The kindness that’s been extended to Mary Jo and me has been just actually overwhelming from the time we’ve been here as the interim,” Myers said during his appointment Nov. 15. “The opportunity to come back to a state I love and has helped shape me was important, and the same goes for the university. I’m passionate about our mission here at Kansas State University.”\n\nBorn and raised in Merriam, Kansas, Myers joined the Air Force in 1965 through the ROTC program at K-State and became a four star general. His distinguished military career includes serving as the 15th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2001 to 2005. As the nation’s highest ranking military officer, Myers served as the principal military adviser to the president, the secretary of defense and the National Security Council.\n\nRegent Dennis Mullin, chair of the K-State Presidential Search Committee, said Myers’ leadership experience and love for K-State will serve the university well.\n\n“The decision was a hard choice because of the quality of candidates that applied,” Mullin said. “General Myers surfaced to the top because of his strong leadership and vision. When the board looked at the needs of K-State today, they believed that his skill set was aligned closely to those goals. His effectiveness as interim president and his love for K-State were also great attributes.”\n\nAmy Button Renz ’76, ’86, president and CEO of the K-State Alumni Association, is excited to work with President Myers going forward.\n\n“We are very proud to have such a distinguished graduate of Kansas State University selected to serve as our 14th president,” she said. “President Myers is an incredible individual who readily shares how his education at K-State helped shape who he is today. His warm, sincere personality resonates with members of our Wildcat community, and people really appreciate how he willingly embraces our Midwest values. We are also fortunate to have his wonderful partner, Mary Jo, a past member of the alumni board, serving as first lady of our university.”\n\nK-State Alumni Association board members Sylvia White Robinson ’71 and Travis Lenkner ’01 also expressed their excitement about President Myers’ appointment.\n\n“His commitment to the students, employees, faculty, administration and alumni is beyond reproach,” Robinson said. “I am confident that his leadership, as president of K-State, will continue to advance the university toward academic excellence and being the No. 1 choice of students and families in the state of Kansas.”\n\n“A proven leader and passionate K-Stater, General Myers is uniquely positioned to help the university meet its strategic goals while addressing significant challenges,” Lenkner said. “The General and Mary Jo will help take Kansas State to new heights. Our alma mater is in great hands!”\n\nWatch President Myers’ full comments on his appointment as the next president of Kansas State University.\n\nThis fall, Kansas State University has been recognized for its diversity and inclusion initiatives, as well as for its excellence in outreach and communications.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, K-State has received a Higher Education Excellence in Diversity, or HEED, award from INSIGHT into Diversity magazine. HEED award institutions are selected based on their exemplary diversity initiatives and inclusion of all aspects of diversity, including gender, race, ethnicity, veterans, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\n“This recognition is another motivator for the Office of Diversity to continue its efforts toward diversity and inclusion at K-State and to soar to even greater heights,” said Zelia Wiley, interim associate provost for diversity. “It is the combined effort and collaboration of all who help make our university one of the best for multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion across the country.”\n\nK-State creative teams receive CASE awards\n\nK-State’s Division of Communications and Marketing, the KSU Foundation and the K-State Alumni Association have received 35 awards from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, or CASE. K-State is a part of CASE District VI, and every year the district presents awards highlighting the best practices in alumni relations, fundraising, public and governmental relations, advancement services, special events and communications.\n\nThe K-State Alumni Association will receive 12 CASE awards for creative works and programs from 2015-16.\n\n“We are honored to be recognized by CASE for the programming, communications and other services the Alumni Association provides to the greater Wildcat Community,” said Amy Button Renz ’76, ’86, president and CEO of the K-State Alumni Association. “These awards showcase the dedication, creativity and passion to K-State that our staff possesses.”\n\nThe association’s awards:\n\nGold awards for excellence in research, medicine and science news writing for K-Stater magazine; innovative uses of technology for the exclusive holiday gifts email; Alumni Fellows special event; marketing and branding of the 100th Homecoming celebration; design of the Wildcats Forever poster; and the May 2016 @K-State alumni e-newsletter.\n\nSilver awards for the K-State License Plate Program in the best practices in alumni relations platinum category; the August 2015 @K-State alumni e-newsletter; the design of the K-State Alumni Association 2016 member calendar; Kansas State University’s 100th Homecoming celebration special event; and best uses of social media for #DormWars social media campaign.\n\nA bronze award for the Kansas City Wabash CannonBall 10th Anniversary Fund-A-Wildcat fundraising video.\n\nThe KSU Foundation will receive eight CASE awards for creative works and programs from 2015-16.\n\n“The public launch of the Innovation and Inspiration Campaign was a central tenet of the foundation’s work this year, so it is rewarding to receive so many awards recognizing those efforts,” said Greg Willems, KSU Foundation president and CEO. “Moreover, it was an honor to collaborate so closely with our campus partners and many volunteers to advance this transformational campaign.\"\n\nThe foundation’s awards:\n\nGrand gold awards for Innovation and Inspiration Campaign Launch event and the spring 2016 Good for K-State magazine.\n\nGold awards for the foundation’s gift planning package; the Innovation and Inspiration case statement; and the winter 2015 Good for K-State Innovation and Inspiration commemorative campaign edition.\n\nA silver award for the winter 2015 Good for K-State magazine design.\n\nBronze awards for personalized trustee engagement Pinchbook, and the Innovation and Inspiration Campaign #KStateInspires social media initiative.\n\nK-State’s Division of Communications and Marketing will receive 15 CASE awards for creative works from 2015-16.\n\n“Kansas State University’s unified voice is successful at inspiring teamwork and creativity among many talented individuals,” said Jeff Morris ’80, university vice president for communications and marketing. “We are honored to receive 35 of these prestigious awards across the university’s teams, and proud to continue advancing and supporting higher education in the state of Kansas.”\n\nThe division’s awards:\n\nA grand gold award for the statewide Extension website branding and integrated marketing in the best practices in communications and marketing platinum category.\n\nGold awards for the K-State Admissions Holiday Greetings Video; spring 2016 Seek research magazine in the special constituency magazine category; and design of the spring 2016 Seek research magazine.\n\nSilver awards for the #WildcatWay Brand Experience Campaign; university website news distribution RSS technique; The Wildcat Way “What makes traditions unforgettable?” institutional spot; and excellence in research, medicine and science news writing.\n\nBronze awards for the K-State economic impact website; The Experience Matters annual magazine; 2016 K-State Open House postcard; K-State Research Showcase information video; spring 2016 Seek research magazine in the institutional relations research publication category; the Johnson Cancer Research Center “The fight starts here” commercial; and Archeological Field School photograph.\n\nA university president, a luxury wedding planner and a physician for Kansas State University Wildcat football were among those recognized at the College of Human Ecology’s annual Celebration of Excellence.\n\nFor 2016, eight honorees were selected across disciplines for their contribution to the college, devotion to their area of specialization and the difference they make for people. They all live out the college’s motto, “In a world that focuses on things, we focus first on people.”\n\nJohn Buckwalter, dean, presented the awards at a luncheon at the Holiday Inn at the Campus in late October.\n\nThe eight awardees were Brett Horton ’91, David W. Andrews ’80, Haley Van Wagenen ’08, Heidi Jeanneret Pickerell ’96, Dr. Keith Wright ’76, Nelli Feehan Sparkman ’10, Tracy Gault-Shields, and Kristie Stirewalt Winter ’97 and Michelle Stirewalt Hutton ’97, sharing an entrepreneur award.\n\nBrett Horton\n\nBrett Horton is a 1991 graduate in restaurant, hotel and institution management and has been selected for the executive leadership award. Horton is the senior director of operations for the WinShape Foundation, recently promoted from director of WinShape Retreat, Mount Berry, Georgia.\n\nOn a daily basis, Horton manages the WinShape Retreat, formerly the Normandy-inspired educational dairy farm of Berry College. Today the buildings offer meeting space, activities, meals and overnight stays to those who are interested in a spiritual haven that is free from media and outside influence. Groups of all sizes utilize WinShape Retreat for marriage, leadership, ministry, corporate and relationship programming. Horton oversees the Cathy Family operation, which consists of an 80-room facility, 100-acre campus, and all sales, events and food service that result in grace-based hospitality.\n\nFrom K-State, Horton traveled to West Virginia to the Greenbrier Hotel and Resort for the first three years of his career. His next leap was to the Broadmoor Hotel and Resort, managing one of its restaurants. While at the Broadmoor in Colorado, Horton earned a MBA in finance. Soon after, Horton acquired his doctorate in restaurant, hotel, institution and tourism management from Purdue University, also developing a passion for teaching as he took a faculty position at Iowa State University and then James Madison University. His passion for students fueled his desire to make a difference one student at a time.\n\nDavid W. Andrews\n\nDavid W. Andrews earned a master’s degree in child development in 1980 and is the recipient of the distinguished service award. He recently became president of National University, California’s second-largest private, nonprofit university, which serves 30,000 students. With three decades of acclaimed higher education experience in a broad range of academic and educational leadership posts, Andrews is leading National’s commitment to transforming higher education through innovation, collaboration and an exceptional student experience.\n\nPrior to coming to National University, Andrews was dean of the School of Education at Johns Hopkins University. During his tenure, the school established a reputation for quality that earned it U.S. News & World Report’s No. 1 ranking of graduate schools of education for two years in a row. While at Hopkins, Andrews helped found the nonprofit organization Deans for Impact and led the design and build of the first new public elementary school in East Baltimore in over 25 years. Before his work at Johns Hopkins, Andrews led a merger that resulted in the creation of the College of Education and Human Ecology at Ohio State University and was the new college’s founding dean.\n\nAndrews earned his bachelor’s degree in psychology from Auburn University, a master’s degree in child development from K-State and a doctorate, also in child development, from Florida State University. His scholarly work has focused on intervening in the life course of high risk students.\n\nHaley Van Wagenen\n\nHaley Van Wagenen will receive the rising professional award. Upon graduation from K-State’s interior design program in 2008, she began working at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, SOM, in Washington, D.C., where she gained experience working on large projects in the government sector. An interest in history and a desire to promote sustainability took her to the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a master’s degree in historic preservation and a certificate in ecological architecture. Van Wagenen’s thesis work focused on using building information modeling to create living models of historic buildings to aid in renovations and reuse. As a full-time student in Philadelphia, she worked part time for SOM New York, splitting time between the two cities for work and studies. After earning her master’s, she joined the New York office full time, and began to focus on global corporate headquarters for financial institutions and technology companies.\n\nVan Wagenen has recently joined SOM’s London office, where she leads interior design initiatives on projects in Europe. She travels weekly to Geneva, Switzerland, where she serves as the on-site client contact for one of the major international organizations headquartered there. The 2.2 million square foot project involves renovation of a historic building and the design of a new office building on the campus.\n\nVan Wagenen is a certified interior designer in the State of New York, holds a National Council for Interior Design Qualification certificate and has earned the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED AP BD+C credential. She takes time to give back to K-State through video conferencing with interior design classes and hosting design study tour students at SOM’s London office.\n\nHeidi Jeanneret Pickerell\n\nAs a 1996 graduate in family studies and community services, and gerontology with an emphasis in long-term care administration, Heidi Pickerell is the recipient of the public advocacy award. She has built on her K-State education in community services, gerontology and long-term care administration in her current role as president and chief executive officer of Meals on Wheels of Shawnee and Jefferson Counties. She has both a heart for client needs and almost two decades of experience with executive management. In her previous role as vice president of program development for Midland Care Connections Inc., Pickerell became well versed in state and federal regulations, grant writing and strategic planning. These skills benefited the Midland clients, who are hospice patients, respite care clients and elderly, not unlike those Pickerell helps every day at Meals on Wheels.\n\nWith her desire to serve, Pickerell is president of the Meals on Wheels Association of Kansas and president of the Topeka American Business Women’s Association Career Chapter. She volunteers in her community — on the local school board and as PTO president for 13 years. Pickerell stays in touch with K-State by speaking to gerontology students about career opportunities in aging.\n\nDr. Keith A. Wright\n\nBecause of his ongoing involvement with K-State, Keith A. Wight will be recognized with the friend of the college award. Since he has been a lifelong K-State fan, there was only one university for Wright to attend, so he walked onto the football team to play two seasons under Coach Vince Gibson. When a chronic back condition ended his football dreams, Wright focused on academics and earned a bachelor’s degree in pre-medicine in 1976. His next steps were a University of Kansas Medical School medical degree in 1979 followed by a three-year residency at Baptist Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, which exposed Wright to sports medicine.\n\nWright moved to Bolivar, Missouri, to join other family physicians in the creation of the Bolivar Family Care Center. In 1991, Wright returned to Manhattan to become the medical director for Coach Bill Snyder’s football program’s medicine department. He also went into private practice with Manhattan Family Physicians and in 2000 began Stonecreek Family Physicians with fellow physicians.\n\nIn his voluntary role as K-State football’s team physician, Wright is also directly involved in educating K-State students about sports medicine. He has allowed students to obtain observation hours with him both at Stonecreek, as a general practitioner, and in the training room at K-State, treating athletes. At least once per year, Wright visits the classroom and provides didactic instruction on various sports medicine topics. He has worked side-by-side educating and instructing K-State athletic training staff and athletic training students on a daily basis as they all support the ’Cats.\n\nWright’s involvement in the community isn’t limited to giving back to K-State students, as he is a senior aviation medical examiner for the FAA, medical director for Manhattan’s Homecare and Hospice, keyboardist in the Manhattan Barefoot Dixieland Band, First United Methodist Church choir member and Colbert Hills’ Champions Club member.\n\nNellie C. Feehan Sparkman\n\nStarting her own successful business has earned Nellie C. Sparkman the entrepreneur award just five years after receiving her 2010 degree in hospitality management. As she grew up in the restaurant and catering industry, Sparkman was groomed for a career in event planning. She started Events by Nellie while still in school at K-State in 2007 and over the last nine years has coordinated hundreds of events. Sparkman plans and implements events ranging from nonprofit galas to luxury weddings. Her niche as one of Kansas City’s premier wedding planners has made her a preferred event planner for elite venues such as the Brass on Baltimore, the Hilton President, the Bauer and the Grand Plaza event space.\n\nExperience is evident in Sparkman’s approach to diverse events and the wants and needs of her Events by Nellie clients. In addition to a family history of food, beverage and catering, Sparkman took advantage of her time at K-State to work in the hotel industry and after graduation took a position in Ireland with a national hotel chain. Upon returning to Kansas City, she worked in nonprofit and corporate event planning coordinating fundraising events and large auctions; event management in hotels, local and international; and catered small birthday parties and large award celebrations.\n\nSimultaneously, Events by Nellie continued to grow and in 2016, with over 30 weddings and events to coordinate, Sparkman took the business full time. Also in 2016, she was chosen to plan and execute a 48-hour proposal for Helzberg Diamond’s national Valentine’s Day campaign, “We Propose, You Propose.” Events by Nellie’s weddings have been featured on theknot.com, in EA Bride, Borrowed & Blue, BeSpoke Bride and Glamour & Grace, and Sparkman has earned the Wedding Wires Couples’ Choice Award in 2015 and 2016, and The Knot Best of Weddings recognition in 2016. In July 2016, Sparkman launched and co-produced a unique bridal show alternative, Bridal Bash, in Kansas City. She remains connected to her K-State roots through presenting on campus to hospitality management classes and continually taking on hospitality students as interns for Events by Nellie.\n\nTracy Gault-Shields\n\nTracy Gault-Shields is the recipient of the partner award for the ways in which she supports students in the College of Human Ecology. For more than a decade, she has been with Darden, parent company of more than 1,500 restaurants, including Longhorn Steakhouse, Olive Garden, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and The Capital Grille. She is a talent acquisition manager and is responsible for recruiting and hiring top-notch managers for the Longhorn Steakhouse brand in the Eastern, Midwestern and Western regions of the U.S. Gault-Shields staffs management at 129 restaurants in 17 states.\n\nGault-Shields knows it is important to have an enjoyable career, and she loves meeting and networking with new people and accepting the challenge of finding the right person to become a part of the Longhorn Steakhouse family. She spends time on college campuses, where she can share with students about Longhorn Steakhouse and Darden, but also discuss other pertinent issues college students face in the business world.\n\nSince 2005, Gault-Shields has hired 16 hospitality management students from K-State, and beginning in 2015, when Longhorn Steakhouse began its internship program, the first intern at the Longhorn Steakhouse in Manhattan was a K-State hospitality management student who was hired into management following his internship. Between presenting to classes on campus and attending K-State’s hospitality career fair each year, Gault-Shields is a genuine partner to furthering the education and professional experiences of K-State students.\n\nMichelle Stirewalt Hutton and Kristie Stirewalt Winter\n\nCommonly known as the Trasey Twins, Michelle Stirewalt Hutton and Kristie Stirewalt Winter will be accepting the entrepreneur award as co-owners of TwinFitness, a female-centered, private personal training studio in Overland Park, Kansas. Founded in 2003, TwinFitness has a goal of inspiring every woman to be her very best. From their two locations and alongside their 13 employees, Hutton and Winter offer comprehensive personal training, nutrition coaching and preparation for fitness, figure and bikini competitions.\n\nWith their 1997 K-State bachelor’s degrees in exercise science and nutrition, the twins utilized their education to specialize in training the female body for competition. They have furthered their education through certifications in endocrinology, nutrition coaching from Precision Nutrition, and personal training and group exercise instruction from the American Council of Exercise. To provide comprehensive resources to their clients, the twins created an online nutrition program that compliments their personal training business and developed their own supplement line, formulated especially for women.\n\nAfter graduating from K-State, Hutton and Winter began competing in fitness and bikini competitions; they have collectively walked the stage for over 80 shows, earned more than 900 trophies from National Physique Committee, or NPC, competitions, and for eight years straight have won the best team award at the biggest NPC show in Kansas City. In 2011, both Winter and Hutton earned their International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness, or IFBB, bikini pro cards, marking each as a professional bikini competitor.\n\nAs industry experts, they have trained over 5,000 clients and customers. The twins are a dynamic pair who have written three cookbooks together and been featured in many fitness-based magazines, including Flex, KC Fitness, NPC News Online and Oxygen. They have the expertise, education and personal training experience to lead their TwinFitness clients to success in achieving their goals.\n\nThe Kansas State Polytechnic Flight Team has landed the honor of competing on a national stage after qualifying in regional play with a third-place finish as well as winning several individual awards.\n\nAttending the National Intercollegiate Flying Association’s SAFECON competition Oct. 17-20 in Norman, Oklahoma, the flight team — from Kansas State University’s Polytechnic Campus — battled it out against other colleges in its region for the chance to advance to the national championship. After participating in a variety of events consisting of tests both on the ground and in the air, the Kansas State Polytechnic Flight Team placed third overall, securing its spot at nationals in May.\n\n“During the weeks leading up to regionals, the team spent many hours working on the intricacies of each event, and then during the competition, everyone did an excellent job of executing what they had learned,” said Austin Bally, Wichita, Kansas, a senior in professional pilot and captain of the flight team. “Along with the third-place team finish, we earned several top 10 placings in the ground events and many top five scores in the flight events. Our success was a collaborative effort and proved that practice pays off.”\n\nThe Kansas State Polytechnic Flight Team faced six other universities during the SAFECON regional: Oklahoma State University, which placed first; University of Nebraska, Omaha, which came in second; Southeastern Oklahoma State University; University of Central Missouri; St. Louis University, Parks College; and University of Oklahoma. Members of each team entered ground and flight events, such as landing a plane accurately in a designated area, recognizing different types of aircraft from ambiguous photos and attempting to hit a target while dropping an item from the air. Participants earned points for each event entered, which were then accumulated to score single event winners as well as the top three teams and the overall top pilot.\n\nOne of the individual standout moments came from Kansas State Polytechnic senior Chris Messing, Wichita, Kansas, who, because of his placings in seven events, accrued enough points to win both Top Scoring Contestant and the Top Pilot award out of more than 80 total participants from the seven universities. Messing — who enjoys being a flight team member because of the family atmosphere, continued development of his aviation knowledge and the opportunity to network — says earning the principal honors was unexpected, but it has given him validation and confidence.\n\n“Going into the competition, I just wanted to do my best so I could give my teammates the opportunity to experience nationals,” Messing said. “I’m proud to win these awards because they demonstrate that my hard work and preparation for the competition have been worth it. They also give me more confidence to know I can accomplish anything as long as I study, stay focused and do what’s right.”\n\nAlong with Messing, the following members of the Kansas State Polytechnic Flight Team competed at regionals; included are individual placings:\n\nNicholas Terrapin, junior, Alma, Kansas, first in message drop, fifth in navigation, 22nd in aircraft recognition and 22nd in power-off landing; Mason McMillan, senior, Ozawkie, Kansas, eighth in power-off landing, 10th in aircraft preflight inspection, 22nd in short field landing and 22nd in simulated comprehensive aircraft navigation; Caleb Strahm, freshman, Sabetha, Kansas, 25th in computer accuracy; Austin Bally, senior, Wichita, second in power-off landing, fifth in navigation, 11th in computer accuracy, 14th in simulated comprehensive aircraft navigation and 16th in short field landing; and Maddie Perry, sophomore, Wichita, 15th in short field landing and 34th in computer accuracy.\n\nJacob Mitchell, junior, Foxfield, Colorado, eighth in navigation, ninth in aircraft preflight inspection, 10th in power-off landing and 22nd in computer accuracy; Jason Rohlf, freshman, Tipton, Iowa, second in aircraft recognition; Scott Agee, senior, Independence, Missouri, first in message drop, sixth in ground trainer, 13th in navigation, 24th in short field landing and 26th in simulated comprehensive aircraft navigation; Zachariah Smith, freshman, Hendersonville, North Carolina, 28th in aircraft recognition; Christopher Pennington, senior, El Paso, Texas, first in aircraft recognition; and Matthew Katzke, junior, Waukesha, Wisconsin, eighth in navigation, 21st in simulated comprehensive aircraft navigation and 23rd in computer accuracy.\n\nThe flight team has 20 members, with 12 on the travel team after a tryout process. Along with competing annually, flight team members also use their club as way to give back to the community and to connect children with aviation. Throughout the year the team is a part of several events like the All-University Open House and Candy Canes and Airplanes. It also conducts two aviation camps for kids and one for high school students in the summer.\n\nIn 2014, the flight team won the Loening Trophy at nationals, which is considered the oldest and most elite of all collegiate aviation awards. It recognized the team as having the most outstanding all-around aviation program in the country.\n\nFor more information on the flight team, including sponsorship, contact faculty adviser Benjamin Jaffee at (785) 826-2978 or bjaffee@k-state.edu.\n\nResearchers at Kansas State University have identified a new swine circovirus.\n\nIts discovery is auspicious, as a related swine circovirus, porcine circovirus type 2, also known as PCV2, has had a devastating history in swine production. Associated diseases caused millions of dollars in losses globally in the 1900s and early 2000s.\n\nThe new circovirus — identified as porcine circovirus 3 — discovered by Benjamin Hause and Rachel Palinski, who is with the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, along with collaborators at K-State, Iowa State University and Smithfield Hog Production, is different from other known circoviruses.\n\n“The Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory was sent samples from sows with signs of clinical disease typically caused by PCV2 infection; however, the samples were negative for PCV2,” said Hause, an adjunct professor at K-State’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Through further investigation, we identified an extremely novel, divergent new species of circovirus. We also performed polymerase chain reaction testing, or PCR, on random samples submitted to the lab to see how widespread this virus is in the U.S. swine herd. Twelve percent were positive for this new virus. We are hoping this is not the beginning of what could be a whole new epidemic of circovirus infections.”\n\nPalinski is a doctoral student in pathobiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe results of the discovery were published in the article “A novel porcine circovirus distantly related to known circoviruses is associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure,” which appears in the November issue of the Journal of Virology, produced by the American Society for Microbiology.\n\nPorcine circovirus type 2 was first identified in Canada in the mid-1990s during sporadic outbreaks of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, or PWMS, where young pigs fail to thrive and progressively lose body condition.\n\n“PCV2 caused sporadic disease at first, but then there were massive epidemics of PMWS in Asia and Europe, and in North America in the early 2000s,” Hause said. “When I started working in the industry in 2005, this was about the height of this disease, and it literally killed millions and millions of pigs.”\n\nHause said that vaccination for porcine circovirus type 2 has successfully controlled the disease, but that it continues to be one of the most significant viruses of swine.\n\n“Now we have a novel porcine circovirus that is distantly related to known circoviruses and that has been identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, or PDNS, and reproductive failure,” Hause said. “Porcine circovirus 2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified here. This virus is clearly not a variant of PCV2, but a novel virus in its own right.”\n\nPhoto: Benjamin Hause works with graduate student Rachel Palinski to identify a unique virus suspected of causing recent cases of disease in swine."
