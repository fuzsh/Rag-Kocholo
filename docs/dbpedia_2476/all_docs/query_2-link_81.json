        "text": "Alice Fujie Oda Tamura was born in Kealia, Kaua'i in 1927. She was a graduate of Kapa'a High School and Honolulu Business School. She completed her secretarial training program in 1948 and started her career at Fort Shafter. In November 1951, she moved back to Kaua'i and began her 30+ year career working in hospital settings by accepting a position in the administrative offices at Wilcox Memorial Hospital. For three years Alice became almost totally immersed in hospital life while living with the nurses in their quarters on the hospital grounds. For Alice, living and working at Wilcox Hospital resulted in friendships with nurses that endured over the years and a growing identification with the medical professions.\n\nMarriage to Bunki Tamura took Alice back to Honolulu where she took a position as secretary in the Queen's Hospital School of Nursing, until after its closure, then she was transferred to the hospital's administrative offices and worked as a secretary until she retired in 1982.\n\nAlice admired, respected and trusted nurses. She had intimate knowledge of the work that they did and especially was respectful of the rigorous education and training that they received in the School of Nursing. Alice regarded the years that she worked as the secretary of the School of Nursing as the golden years of her career.\n\nAlice passed away March 9, 1998. The donor of this fund would like to pay tribute to her sister by establishing this scholarship for students who aspire to become nurses.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to provide scholarships to students who are enrolled in the Associate in Science degree in Nursing program at Kapiolani Community College.

She graduated from Maui High School and married her high school sweetheart Willard Nagata and began a family with three children. For 40+ years she was a cannery worker for the Maui Land and Pineapple Company.\n\nAlice was a sweet, gentle, generous and loving person who, in her quiet way, lived life fully. She worked very hard at the pineapple cannery, raised her three children and enjoyed her hobby of raising plants and Japanese flower arranging \"ikebana\". After retiring in 1995, she was very active in many senior activities and learned to dance the hula, play the ukulele, learned oil painting and sang in the Kahului Union Church Chancellor Choir. She especially enjoyed being a grandma to her two grandchildren. Alice also enjoyed traveling to the mainland, especially California to see her sisters and brothers.\n\nIn 2001, Alice suffered from an episode of severe depression and fully recovered. She resumed her usual hobbies and traveled to the mainland and abroad to Europe to visit her grandson. Then, in 2008, she had a second episode of depression which resulted in multi-organ failure due to dehydration and her passing on July 23, 2008.\n\nWith Alice's situation on Maui in 2001 and 2008 there were very limited qualified geriatric resources for her and her family. The contribution of the Alice Sakata Nagata Scholarship is to support Maui students who are very motivated for a career in aging, to work with the elderly and their families on Maui.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to assist Maui College students in need of financial assistance who are pursuing studies in long term care and/or have an interest in working with the elderly or aging community on the island of Maui.\n\nCriteria\n\nMust be studying in long-term care and/or have an interest in working with the elderly or aging community on Maui\n\nMust be full-time\n\nHave financial need as determined by federal guidelines\n\nHave a GPA of 3.0 or better\n\nAnthony Bongo was born on February 25, 1947 to Gregorio and Leonora Bongo. He was the second of four children and was a respectful and loving son and brother. He attended Waianae High School and served as class president during his sophomore and junior years. After graduating from high school in 1965, he attended Honolulu Community College and studied drafting. In 1967 he earned his Associate Degree in Science in Drafting.\n\nDuring this time, the Vietnam conflict was on, so he decided to protect the home front and joined the U.S. Army Reserve Unit of the Hawai'i National Guard. He went to Fort Ord, California for basic training and was singled out for officer training school. However, since he had no intention of making the military his life's career, he declined the offer. Upon his return from basic training, he was employed by Hawaiian Telephone Co., and life was going according to plan.\n\nThen suddenly in 1969, the Hawai'i National Guard and the Arkansas National Guard were activated. He quickly married his sweetheart, and ten days later he was deployed to Vietnam. Shortly upon his arrival, he was made a platoon leader and on May 20, 1969 he was killed in a combat operation protecting his men on Hamburger Hill near Thua Thien. He was laid to rest with military honors at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl, Hawai'i. His name is etched on the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C. as well as on a pedestal at the Vietnam War Memorial on the grounds of the State Capitol in Honolulu.

The Foundation honors the memory and spirit of Kane Fernandez, an avid fisherman, an astute businessman, generous philanthropist and beloved member of his Hawaiian and Haida Gwaii communities.\n\nKane Fernandez was one of Langara's most welcome guests, visiting two or three times each year. Kane encouraged and supported university education in his home state and, as a native Hawaiian, felt a strong connection to the island culture of Haida Gwaii. The Foundation awards scholarships to qualified Queen Charlotte Island graduates to attend Hawai'i universities with the long-term goal of changing coastal communities through education. That circle of honor is now being widened to afford British Columbia students the opportunity to visit Hawai'i to study its comparatively rich diverse marine life.\n\nIn 2003, Roger Earle, a board member of the Kane Fernandez Scholarship Foundation, strong supporter of education and life-long friend of Kane Fernandez, passed away.

Sasaki was the fourth of five children born to immigrant parents from Japan who worked on a sugar plantation in Mountain View on the Big Island of Hawai'i. George's schooling ended at the 4th grade.\n\nIn 1927, George moved to O'ahu at the age of 16. The turning point in his life occurred in 1936, when he served as a juror on a murder trial while employed at O'ahu Railroad and Land, as an oiler. At the end of the day, during on-going jury deliberations, an FBI agent took George home and told him not to talk to anyone about the murder case and he should call them to report anyone asking him about the case.\n\nLater that afternoon, an influential, politically-connected man contacted George and asked George to come to his office. George went to his office, where this man told George to vote \"guilty\". Needless to say, George was intimidated. However, George was able to intelligently say with civility: \"Did you just ask me about the murder case? May I use your phone?\" The man replied, \"why the hell do you want to use my phone?\" George explained that the FBI instructed him to call them if anyone asked him about the murder case. George was able to return home safely that evening.\n\nGeorge realized that if he could stand up to such a powerful man, he could do anything. He quit his job as an oiler and decided to become a door-to-door appliance and jewelry salesperson. He went to Kansas City to attend watch-making school and through random acts of kindness from strangers, he was encouraged to succeed. He was able to establish and build a very successful jewelry business based on his honesty and integrity.\n\nGeorge met his wife, Kay, in 1936. She was born in Honolulu, Hawai'i, the first born child of four. Her formal education ended in her junior year at McKinley High School. She was nine years younger than George. Kay's father was the owner of C&W Bakery near Keeaumoku Street on the island of O'ahu. George lived close to the bakery, on Kaheka Street, and would frequent the bakery in an effort to get to know Kay. George's mom would always ask him why he was constantly buying more bread.\n\nKay was a supportive wife, a good cook and had a good work ethic. They ran the jewelry business together. George traveled to New York annually to attend the jewelry convention, where he learned the latest trends and purchased merchandise with unique designs.\n\nGeorge and Kay had two children. They provided their son and daughter many wonderful experiences and opportunities.\n\nThe generosity of George H. and Kay K. Sasaki has made this scholarship fund available to University of Hawai'i Community College students.

L. Castle Foundation in honor of Ms. Lagareta to recognize her contributions to the community through her work with the Ronald McDonald House.\n\nKitty Lagareta, business owner and professional communicator who has been active in the community for over 25 years, is chairman and CEO of Communications Pacific, Hawai‘i’s leading integrated communications firm. Lagareta has served on the University of Hawai‘i Board of Regents since 2003, including two years as vice chair and two as chair.\n\nAt Communications Pacific, Lagareta has provided strategic counsel and assistance to some of Hawai‘i’s largest companies, as well as many well-known national companies that do business in Hawai‘i.\n\nBefore joining Communications Pacific (in 1986), Lagareta was a founding board member and the first executive director of Hawai‘i’s Ronald McDonald House. Later, she served as vice president of the Kapi‘olani Health Foundation. She currently serves on the boards of the American Red Cross – Hawai‘i State Chapter, Boy Scouts of America Aloha Council, and Enterprise Honolulu. She is a past president of the Rotary Club of Honolulu, Hawai‘i’s oldest and largest Rotary Club; and she served two terms on the board of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawai‘i. Among the other organizations on whose boards she has also served are HiBEAM (Hawai‘i Business Entrepreneur and Acceleration Mentors), Young CEOs, and the Hawai‘i Justice Foundation.\n\nPacific Business News named Lagareta its first “Businesswoman of the Year” in 1999. She was also honored that year as one of Hawai‘i’s women leaders at the YWCA Leader Luncheon. In 2002, Junior Achievement of Hawai‘i inducted her into the Hawai‘i Business Hall of Fame. In 2003, the Hawai‘i Chapter of the March of Dimes honored her with the Franklin Delano Roosevelt National Award for Distinguished Community Service, and the Pacific Gateway Center presented her its Community Building Award. Lagareta has received numerous awards for her work from the Hawai‘i chapters of both the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC), and in 2003 PRSA-Hawai‘i named her Public Relations Professional of the Year.\n\nIn 2007, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) – the organization that accredits the University of Hawai‘i – asked Lagareta to participate in a three-person team making a special visit to advise the 10-campus University of California system. As reported in Pacific Business News, WASC generally “asks academic senior executives to participate in these types of visits, which aim to assist school administrators with special issues.” The other members of the team on which Lagareta served were the president of the University of Virginia and the chancellor of the University System of Maryland. As reported in PBN, “UH President David McClain said the executive director of WASC asked Lagareta to participate because of the improvements UH has made in the years she has served as a regent.”\n\nLagareta earned her bachelor’s degree in English literature from the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa in 1981 when her son Chad Dudley was seven years old and her son Kalin Dudley was two years old. Chad was born on February 25, 1974, when Lagareta was 19 years old and working hard to complete her college education, which was a high priority for her and often a financial challenge. In starting this student assistance fund, it is Lagareta’s desire to offer encouragement and financial assistance to students with special responsibilities who are passionate about completing their education. It is also her desire to honor her two sons, both now grown men and college graduates (one also a law school graduate), who make her proud every day.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to provide financial assistance to Windward CC students.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be full time or part time\n\nUndergraduate students enrolled in any course of study at Windward CC\n\nMust have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above\n\nProvide a personal statement describing educational goals, career objective, involvement with volunteer/community service, past work experience and any other information regarding financial situation\n\nTwo letters of recommendations from non-related people\n\nDemonstrate financial need, as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\n\nThe LaFrance Foundation was founded in memory of LaFrance Kapaka-Arboleda of Anahola, Kaua'i. Born on November 13, 1964, she was a respected cultural resource and very active in the Hawaiian community. LaFrance was dedicated to many public causes including building homes for underprivileged local residents and helping mothers with special needs children. She was a champion of the underprivileged and a defender of those who could not defend themselves.\n\nLaFrance served on numerous nonprofit and governmental boards and commissions whose concerns included developing affordable housing, economic development, restoration of cultural sites and land preservation. LaFrance was a courageous visionary who championed causes that she believed would benefit all the people of Hawai'i.\n\nAs Senator Daniel K. Inouye once said, \"I shall not forget LaFrance. She had a feisty spirit and an enduring commitment to her native people and to her beautiful Kaua'i. The last time we were together was in Anahola when she so proudly showed me her community computer lab that we worked on together. LaFrance wanted to be sure that Anahola's children had a safe place after school for tutoring and wholesome activities. I will always think of this center as \"LaFrance's Place.\"\n\nTo honor the memory of her mother LaFrance Kapaka-Arboleda and to help Hawaiʻi's youth receive higher education, Anela Kapaka-Rhoades established a foundation and scholarship fund to support Kauaʻi Community College students facing challenges. Anela remembers, \"LaFrance touched many lives. She would take strangers into her home until they got back on their feet. She would do anything for you.\"\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to assist full-time or part-time undergraduate students in any area of study attending Kaua'i Community College.\n\nCriteria\n\nFull-time or part-time\n\nHave some degree of financial need\n\nHave a GPA of 2.5 or better\n\nMajor in any area of study\n\nDemonstrate involvement in community service projects on Kauai\n\nIn the early 1990's the Amundsons had a discussion about how lucky they had been and what they might do to return something to society. They both grew up in the Minnesota boondocks and came from very economically poor families. It was the middle of the Great Depression. Lloyd's family didn't have electric lights until he was 13 years old or indoor plumbing and running water until he was 20. When Lloyd graduated from high school in 1943, the country was in the middle of World War II and nine of the ten males in his class immediately were inducted into the military. Lloyd chose the Navy and after some tests was transferred to the Navy Air corps. Following training, Lloyd had his first exposure to Hawai'i at Pearl Harbor. After his discharge, Lloyd entered college on the GI bill. Barbara and he married one year after graduation, and in September 2008 celebrated their 57th wedding anniversary.\n\nTheir interest in nursing resulted from each of them having had both hips replaced at the Mayo Clinic and witnessing the great services the staff performed. At the Mayo Clinic, the Amundsons discovered that the school could produce more nurses but were short of instructors. They started the nursing instructors program and sponsored a professorship in orthopedic surgery.\n\nThe Amundsons became interested in the UH Maui College Nursing Program after they participated in a campus tour. The presentation by nurses and discussion of the need for nurses on Maui and the State of Hawai'i convinced the Amundsons to create the nursing endowment at UH Maui College.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to provide scholarships to students in the Nursing Program at UH Maui College.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be full-time, undergraduate students in the Nursing Program at UH Maui College.\n\nRecipients must be Hawai'i residents.\n\nFinancial need shall be a criterion in making this award although not necessarily as defined by Federal guidelines.\n\nThe number and amount of awards shall be determined by the selection committee based on the availability of funds and financial need of the recipients. Recipients are eligible for scholarship renewal so long as all criteria are met.\n\nAt the urging of Daniel Talbert, Margaret's loving companion over the final three decades of her life, the family has established this endowed scholarship in her honor. The scholarship seeks to carry forward the many community-spirited contributions of its founder.\n\nRaised in modest circumstances as the youngest of five siblings, Margaret attended St. Andrews Priory with scholarship assistance, and without the benefit of higher education, became an entrepreneur. Investments with her spouse Timmy Au involved raising farm animals and running a dairy and providing farm workers' families housing and health insurance.\n\nAfter raising four children, Margaret suffered the loss of her husband. With hard work, thrift, and remarkable foresight, Margaret continued as a self-taught real estate investor and developer, combining self-interest with the broad community benefits of modest rental prices for quality accommodations. Kind, humble, and always fair with her clients, Margaret acquired a substantial range of real estate holdings on 'Oahu, yet felt it important to invest as well in the people of Hawai'i.\n\nBecause she appreciated the value of learning in the real world and empathized with those in need, this scholarship gives preference to students who demonstrate community involvement, leadership, or exceptional commitment to family.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to provide scholarships to students in any area of study at any campus in the University of Hawai'i System.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be enrolled full-time or part-time\n\nUndergraduate or graduate student in any area of study at any campus in the University of Hawai'i System\n\nFor a new recipient, a maximum GPA of 3.7\n\nFor a continuing recipient, a minimum GPA of 2.0\n\nPreference shall be given to students who have graduated from a Hawai'i high school\n\nPreference given to students who demonstrate community involvement, leadership or exceptional commitment to family\n\nMichael J. Levin is currently the Senior Census Trainer in the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies (\"HCPDS\"). His PhD in Anthropology from Michigan looked at the effects of population pressure on scarce resources on a 26-acre atoll in Micronesia. He worked for eight years in the East-West Center's Population Program and followed with 28 years at the U.S. Census Bureau. He obtained an MPA from Harvard's Kennedy School in 2007, and then began his work at the Center. He has worked in most of the Pacific Islands countries and territories, Indonesia, India, and more than a dozen African countries, mostly assisting statistical offices in collecting, processing, and analyzing census and survey data.

She was the oldest of five children, born to Japanese immigrants who worked the sugar plantation. Sadly, her dad passed away when she was in the 8th grade, and her mother had no choice but to pull her out of school and put her to work on the plantation to help support the family. She later worked in Hilo at Kalakaua Laundry, Kress Store, Robins clothing stores and Hilo Hattie, always, regretting not having been able to go back to school. She passed on her love of learning to two highly successful sons, Wayne, Vice Chairman of Bank of Hawaii, and Paul, an attorney.

The donor is establishing this fund to honor the founding principles of Fleming's predecessor firm, Oda/McCarty Architects Limited: S. Russell Oda and Harrell McCarty.\n\nWith two very disparate backgrounds, Oda and McCarty met in 1956 as architecture students at the University of Oregon, where they were alphabetically assigned to sit at adjacent drafting tables. Their friendship turned into a business partnership when McCarty moved to Hilo in 1966 and Oda/McCarty Architects, Ltd. was launched. In a period of 40+ years, the firm played a role in the design of some 1,000 construction projects, island-wide, ranging from private residences to institutional buildings. Notable projects include the Wailoa Art Center, Waikoloa Elementary School, nearly all the base facilities for the observatories atop Mauna Kea, participation in the design for UH Hilo's Imiloa Astronomy center, and, most recently, the new state judiciary building in Hilo. Oda/McCarty Architects was acquired by Durrant-Media Five in 2004 and Scott Fleming was brought on to manage the Hilo office, with guidance from Oda and McCarty. In 2008, Durrant-Media Five divested its business interests on Hawaii Island, leading Scott Fleming to open Fleming & Associates, LLC in January 2009.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be full-time or part-time, undergraduate students in any area of study at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.\n\nRecipients shall have a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 or above.\n\nFinancial need shall be a criterion in making this award although not necessarily as defined by federal guidelines.\n\nThe Order of the Eastern Star Hawaii Chapter No. 1 was instituted in Hilo on June 3, 1899.\n\nThis endowment honors Mabel Hitchcock Schoen, a devout member of The Order of the Eastern Star Hawaii Chapter No. 1, and her daughter, Mary H. Schoen.\n\nEastern Star is a social order comprised of persons with deep religious convictions and spiritual values, but is not a religion. The members of The Order of the Eastern Star Hawaii Chapter No. 1 are dedicated women and men who sincerely reflect the spirit of fraternal love and the desire to work together for good. It gives them the opportunity to give a part of their time to many projects that benefit mankind.\n\nAccording to Martha Bell, Trustee of The Order of the Eastern Star Hawaii Chapter No. 1, the members are proud of their Order's heritage.

He attended public grade school in Hawai?i and graduated from the Kamehameha School for Boys in 1942. Like many of his generation, Senator Akaka's youth was interrupted by World War II. Upon graduation from high school, he served as a civilian worker in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1943-1945, and served in the U.S. Army from 1945 to 1947. Following the war, Senator Akaka returned to school enrolling in the University of Hawai'i and received a Bachelor of Education degree in 1952. He went on to earn a professional certificate in secondary education in 1953, a professional certificate in school administration in 1961, and a Master of Education degree in 1966.\n\nIn 1976, Senator Akaka was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and served until May 16, 1990. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate on May 16, 1990 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Senator Spark Masayuki Matsunaga, subsequently winning a special election to the office in November 1990. He was re-elected in 1994, 2000 and 2006, and served in the U.S. Senate until January 3, 2013.

After graduating from Maui High School, he moved to O'ahu to attend the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. To pay for his tuition he started a floor covering business which eventually evolved into Stanford Carr Development, LLC (SCD), a successful company which develops award-winning residential communities, commercial projects, and special needs housing.\n\nActive in the community, Carr is a current Foundation trustee, director of Enterprise Honolulu and a member of the Building Industry Association. In addition, he has sat on the boards of Build-Pac Hawai'i and Hawai'i Developer's Council.

His first job was pumping gas at von Hamm-Young Co.'s service station, but foreseeing a career in business, he took business-related night classes and became a successful outside salesman in von Hamm-Young's appliance division. In 1946, he and a partner started Modern Appliance Co., selling and repairing home appliances. His son Paul eventually took over the business. By the time the store ended its run in 2009, it had survived two tsunamis, a changing economy and the arrival of national retail chains.\n\nKaoru Nishimura (1912-2002) grew up in the upland community of Kalopa in Hawai'i Island's Hamakua district. After eight years of school, she worked as a sugar plantation laborer when not picking coffee in her family's coffee fields. Kaoru and Tsugio were married in 1933. She stayed home to care for their four children until about 1957, when she began to work full time in the family business.\n\nTsugio was an active volunteer in the Japanese community and a recognized haiku poet, while Kaoru was a certified teacher of Japanese flower arrangement and often helped with church activities.\n\nThe endowment will honor, in perpetuity, Tsugio and Kaoru Nishimura.

He attended Makawele School until the eighth grade and then lived in Waimea where he trained to be a carpenter. After receiving his training in carpentry, he moved to Honolulu in 1938 to work in defense projects for the military. In 1940 he returned to Kaua‘i to marry Fumie Yoshimori and together they moved to Honolulu to settle down. He worked as a carpenter in the construction industry until he passed away at the age of 45 after a bout with cancer.\n\nFumie Yoshimori Yamasaki was born on June 23, 1920 in Koloa, Kaua‘i. She attended Koloa School through the eighth grade and then studied sewing at the Waimea Sewing School for 3 ½ years. After moving to Honolulu with her husband Tsutomu in 1940, she worked at various manufacturing companies to support the family. In 1958 she and her husband Tsutomu decided to open their own dress shop called “Bette Jean’s” on King Street across Aala Park. In 1963, she bought and opened a second shop on Hotel Street in the downtown area. At that time, she had a staff of seven full-time employees. As a small business owner, Fumie designed all the dresses for her shop, produced the patterns and supervised the cutting and sewing of the garments. After her husband passed away, she also carried out some of the financial responsibilities of running the business including doing the payroll and paying appropriate taxes.\n\nIn the early 1970s, when all her daughters had completed their education and were married and settled, Fumie sold her dress shops and began working at various manufacturing companies as a pattern maker and factory supervisor until her retirement in 1982.\n\nThe purpose of this Fund is to provide scholarships to Kaua‘i Community College students with financial need.\n\nCriteria\n\nMust be at least part-time (at least 6 credits)\n\nMust be a graduate of a Kauai high school\n\nMajor in any area of study\n\nPreference given to single parents and to first generation college students\n\nMust have financial need, not necessarily as defined by federal guidelines\n\nThe purpose of this Fund is to provide renewable scholarships to graduates of Hawai‘i public high schools who are accepted into the Pacific Asian Center for Entrepreneurship (“PACE”) Leadership Program at the Shidler College of Business to attend the University of Hawai‘i.

He was a lawyer, a jurist, the Chief Justice and the Governor of the Territory of Hawai'i, an innovator in civic organizations and a published author on subjects concerning Hawai'i, but from his early days his paramount interest was in the judiciary.\n\nFrear was the son of the Rev. Walter Frear and Fannie E. Foster. Born in Grass Valley, California on October 29, 1863, he was descended on his father’s side from Huges Frere, a French Huguenot, who immigrated from Flanders and settled in New York in 1676, and on his mother’s side by George Soule, a pilgrim aboard the Mayflower.\n\nBorn in Honolulu on June 30, 1870, Mary was a daughter of Benjamin F. Dillingham, one of the most prominent businessmen and entrepreneurs in Hawai'i, and Emma Louis Smith, daughter of the Rev. and Mrs. Lowell Smith, who had come to Hawai'i from New England in May of 1833 with the sixth group of American Protestant missionaries. The Frears brought up two daughters, Virginia, who married Urban E. Wilde a lawyer in Honolulu, and Margaret.\n\nMary Frear filled many roles, as mother and homemaker, as well as companion and partner to her husband in all his political, legal, cultural, and civic responsibilities and interests. She helped to organize the local branch of the YWCA and the College Club of Honolulu, was a regent of the University of Hawai'i, active in the Daughters of Hawai'i, and took lead parts in the Little Theatre. Often the approach of the Frears to a community need or an intellectual problem was different, but their goals were always similar. She helped to found the YWCA and he the YMCA. While she was a gifted author of prose and poetry, particularly on Hawaiian subjects, he was an able historian of Hawaiian law and a biographer who wrote entertainingly on Mark Twain in Hawai'i.\n\nThis fund is established to honor Walter F. and Mary Dillingham Frear by providing funding in perpetuity to assist students attending any campus within the University of Hawai'i System.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be full-time or part-time\n\nUndergraduate or graduate students majoring in any area of study at any campus within the University of Hawai'i System\n\nMust have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above\n\nMust be graduates of a Hawai'i high school\n\nBe residents of the State of Hawai'i\n\nFinancial need, not necessarily as defined by federal guidelines\n\nThis fund is being established by Helen Yonge Lind. Her maiden name \"Yonge,\" is the very old English spelling of \"Young\". Her English ancestors stubbornly retained the old spelling through the centuries. Helen is a 1931 graduate of the Kamehameha School for Girls, before Kamehameha became co-educational, and in 1935 she was awarded a BS in Home Economics at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.\n\nShe established this scholarship as a memorial to her grandfather Robert William Cathcart and his daughter Heleualani Eva Cathcart Yonge who was her mother. From them she inherited the means to establish this fund. Robert William Cathcart was born in 1856 in Northern Ireland, and died in Honolulu in 1915. Heleualani, better known as Lani, was born in 1888 in Honolulu where she died in 1959. She was one-half Hawaiian and married a haole from California, Duke Yonge, who died in Waipahu, O'ahu in 1950.\n\nBoth her mother and grandfather were supporters of education, making this a fitting memorial. From her own experiences she knows that an older person, especially a woman who has been out of school for several years and wishes to re-enter, faces difficulties in competing with younger students for scholarship aid.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to support non-traditional adult students returning to college to pursue and/or complete certificates or degrees at any campus within the University of Hawai'i System. Preference shall be given in the following priority: Renewals, and then Native Hawaiian ancestry.\n\nCriteria\n\nRecipients must be full-time or part-time\n\nUndergraduate or graduate attending any campus within the University of Hawai'i System\n\nNon-traditional student, preferably age 25-60\n\nMust be entering for the first time or returning\n\nPriority will be given to students pursuing their first degree or certificate over students pursuing a second degree or certificate, or graduate degree\n\nMust be a Hawai'i resident\n\nGraduated from a Hawai'i high school or students who pass the Hawai'i General Education Development (GED) test\n\nSatisfactory academic progress as determined by the selection committee\n\nFinancial need, not necessarily as defined by federal guidelines\n\nPreference shall be given in the following priority:\n\nRenewals (past recipients who re-apply and meet all scholarship criteria)\n\nStudents of Native Hawaiian ancestry"
