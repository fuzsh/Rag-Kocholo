        "text": "James Denton Hancock was born on June 9, 1837, near Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne county, the son of James and Mary Perkins Hancock. There he acquired his early education in the common schools and Wyoming seminary. In 1855 he entered Kenyon college at Gambier, Ohio, graduating from there in 1859 as honor man. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa, and of Alpha Delta Phi, one of the founders of of the Kenyon chapter of that fraternity. Upon graduation at Kenyon he had conferred upon him the degree of Bachelor of Arts and later the degree of Master of Arts and the honorary Doctor of Laws. He delivered the Phi Beta Kappa address in 1872 and the alumni address in 1899.\n\nHe became a tutor at Western University, now the University of Pittsburgh, upon the completion of his college course. He was professor of mathematics until 1861, meanwhile studying law with William Bakewell of Pittsburgh. Having gained admission to the bar in Allegheny county in 1862, he practiced in Pittsburgh for about three years. In 1865 he removed to Franklin to make his residence, as it proved, in this city for the remainder of his life. He applied immediately to the Venango county bar, and was accepted, later becoming president of the Venango County Bar association.\n\nIn 1865 he also married Ella C. Hitchcock of Pittsburgh, daughter of Lawrence Peres and Elizabeth Johnston Hitchcock. She died in 1871, and in 1872 he married her sister, Mary Kate Hitchcock. He had five children: Lawrence P. Hancock of Buffalo, NY; Mrs. Ella C. Williamson of this city; Mary Elizabeth Hancock, also of Franklin; James Denton Hancock and Philip Gaylord Hancock, both deceased; one granddaughter, Mrs. Katherine Williamson Allen, and a great-granddaughter, Katherine Hancock Allen.\n\nFor 10 years he was solicitor for the Allegheny Valley Railroad Co., dating from 1877, and in 1878 he was appointed attorney for the Pittsburgh, Titusville and Buffalo Railroad Co., serving as such until 1888 when he became general solicitor for the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad Co, with headquarters in Buffalo, NY. He resigned the latter position in December, 1891. He had cases in almost all the courts of western Pennsylvania, as well as in many in the eastern portion. He retired from active business in 1896, but still retained a number of important associations, He was director of diverse corporations including for many years the Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railroad Co. In 1881 he was appointed by Governor Hoyt as on of the trustees of the state hospital for the insane at Warren, PA, and in that position he served for 13 years. In 1888 he was president of the board of directors. He was director of a number of corporations in Franklin and elsewhere.\n\nHe was a staunch Democrat in politics. In 1892 he was the democratic candidate for congressman in his district, losing by a small number of votes, as he did also in 1894 when nominated for congressman at large from Pennsylvania. In 1896 he was nominated for elector at large, but declined to be a candidate on account of his opposition to the policy of the party on the silver issue. Afterward he went as a delegate to the national convention at Indianapolis in 1896, which nominated Palmer and Buckner. He was prominent in the tariff reform movement. In recognition of his writings and addresses on the subject, he was chosen an honorary member of the Cobden club of England, and awarded a silver medal by that organization. He was the author of numerous articles upon various economic questions. Hancock also served as our President General from 1904 to 1905. He was a person of indomitable will and unflinching courage. These qualities kept him on his feet under the accumulating weight of the years until almost the very end.\n\nRogers Clark Ballard Thruston, son of Andrew Jacskon Ballard and Frances Ann Thruston, was born in Louisville, November 6, 1858, the younger of four sons and a daughter. At the request of his mother he assumed her maiden name when he was 16. He took the name “Thruston” by a decision of the Fayette Co. Court in 1884. Thruston remained a bachelor all his life. George Rogers Clark was his great-grandmother’s brother.\n\nThruston was educated at Hopkins Grammar School, New Haven, CT., Williston Seminary, East Hampton, MA., and in 1880 was graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. After graduation he went to work with the Monon Railroad as a clerk.\n\nHe was with the Kentucky Geological Survey for several years, was engaged to buy property for the Interstate Investment Company, and had charge of the land department of the Kentucky Union Land Company. From 1895 to 1899 he was manager of the Big Stone Gap Iron Company of Virginia, selling out his mining interest 10 years later to take up his chief interest – history.\n\nSaved Filson Club. Credit is given to Thruston for the saving of The Filson Club. In 1913 during the last illness of Col. R.T. Durrett, founder and president of the club, a large part of the clubs collection and Durrett’s library were sold, by mistake. Thruston went to the Durrett home, where the club met, salvaged relics that had not been sold and took them to his house where the club met during the following years. When the new fireproof building was constructed in 1929, Thruston, keeping a promise made many years earlier, gave the organization his historical library and collections and an endowment fund of $100,000 in income-producing securities. In 1940 he increased the endowment by another $50,000. A metal tablet honoring Thruston, “whose library and other gifts are a nucleus of these collections,” was placed in the club. In addition to giving the club his library and family relics such as the gloves and crepe that his father wore to Abraham Lincoln’s funeral, Thruston was untiring in his efforts to obtain additional material. He was chiefly responsible for the Photostat copies of 21,000 manuscripts relating to the campaigns of George Rogers Clark, Jouett’s portrait of Clark is another gift to the club from its president.\n\nAnother valuable portion of the club collection is the group of Kentucky mountain-area photographs, interior and exterior, Thruston made during the ‘80s. Many of the pictures are in the gallery of the Forestry Department in Washington.\n\nDuring this era he knew John Fox, Jr and James Lane Allen who drew on the area for material for their stories. Thruston and two other young men, all of whom were appointed special policemen in Big Stone Gap in those turbulent days, were the composite prototype of the young engineers in Fox’s “The Trail of Lonesome Pine.”\n\nThruston was a recognized authority on the US flag. His pamphlet, “The History of the Origin and Evolution of the US Flag” was published by the Government. He wrote comparatively little for publication, but gathered more Kentucky history than any other Kentuckian and made it available to the public. He occasionally contributed his historical magazines. Another of Thruston’s interests was the Louisville Free Public Library. He was a member of the board from 1918 until 1940 when he retired as president of the board. He was a member of the Kentucky Society, Sons of the American Revolution, and a past president of the National S.A.R. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati and the Kentucky Society of Colonial Wars. He served as president of the Yale Alumni Association of Kentucky as a member of the executive committee of the Yale Alumni Advisory Board and as a member of the American Printing House for the Blind, the J.B. Speed Memorial Museum, and the Kentucky State Historical Society. In 1927, he received an honorary degree from the University of Louisville.\n\nHe was the first chairman of the Louisville Chapter of the American Red Cross for Kentucky, serving from 1917 to 1918. He resigned to become assistant manager of the Lake Davison of the American Red Cross in Kentucky and served for three years. The Thruston family presented Louisville with three public playground parks and deeded the original home of George Rogers Clark on Poplar Level Road to the City. The parks are Ballard Square, Churchill Park, and George Rogers Clark Park.\n\nSource:\n\nRogers Clark Ballard Thruston of Louisville, Kentucky (1858-1946).\n\nLen Young Smith was born at Nicholasville, Kentucky, on October 20, 1901, fifth son of Walden Rogers Smith, a country banker, and Margaret Young Smith. After two years at Transylvania College at Lexington, in the adjoining county, Compatriot Smith moved to Illinois to pursue his education at Northwestern University. There he earned his B.A., M.A., and J.D., degrees and was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1927. Honors earned and affiliations include Phi Beta Kappa, Order of the Coif, and Beta Gamma Sigma – honorary fraternities; Phi Alpha Delta, law fraternity; and Kappa Alpha Order, social fraternity at Transylvania.\n\nCompatriot Smith was appointed a bar examiner in 1947 and became President of the Illinois State Board of Law Examiners in\n\n1951, a position he filled for more than three decades. He has served as chairman of the National Conference of Bar Examiners; as member of the Board of Managers and secretary of the Chicago Bar Association; as a member of the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association; and, for six years, as a member of the Council of the Association’s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. In the field of education, Compatriot Smith served his alma mater well and long. He was chairman of the Department of Business Law at Northwestern from 1948 until 1970, during which period he was co-author of eleven volumes on Business Law. In addition, he was consultant to the publishers of a forty-volume series on Illinois Law and Practice.\n\nLen Young Smith’s first job with a law firm led to his lifetime interest and leadership in not only SAR, but a wide spectrum of hereditary societies. One of the partners in the firm was active in the ILSAR, subsequently serving as its president. As are all good SAR’s, he was ever on the lookout for recruits, and the young Kentuckian proved to be a prime prospect.\n\nLen Young Smith was admitted to membership in the Illinois Society in 1928 by right of descent from Joseph Hughes, who served\n\nin the Revolution as a private and a corporal in Captain Alexander Parker’s Company of Foot of the Virginia Battalion. Once alerted to SAR eligibility, he proved eleven supplemental lines! He served ILSAR as Secretary, Registrar, Chancellor and Second Vice-President before becoming its President for two years (1960-1962). He became a Vice President General in 1962, serving out the term of the Vice President General for the Great Lakes District (Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan), Charles Goodwin-Perkins, who died in mid-term. Compatriot Smith’s expertise in genealogical research was recognized by the National Society when he was elected Genealogist General in 1963 and returned to that office for a second year at the 1963 Congress. Between the conclusion of his second term as Genealogist General and his election as President General, Compatriot Smith served on important committees, including the National Executive Committee, of which he was a member, under various Presidents General, a total\n\nof seven terms; chaired the Independence Day Committee and successfully promoted, with letters to every Society, the popular Ringing of the Bells Program, and chaired the Permanent Fund Committee of the Society in later years. He received the Minuteman Medal at the 1966 Congress.\n\nA committee especially important to Compatriot Smith was the Membership Committee. He had received certificates of distinguished service at three Congresses for sponsoring ten new members within a year. And, in his initial “President General’s Message” in the July, 1967 SAR Magazine he said: “Our principal goal this year is a substantial increase in membership. We must work to bring them in.” Prior to his election as President General, Compatriot Smith had stated that, if elected, he “would go any place I’m invited” to visit chapters, societies and districts. At the conclusion of the Seventy Eighth Congress at Williamsburg, Virginia, he called attention to the 56,000 miles he had traveled during his year in office, a new record for any President General at that time. His companion in that travel record was Helen Tuttle Smith, a Northwestern University alumna and then National President, Daughters of Founders and Patriots of America. They had been married in 1930. Their mutual interest in hereditary societies developed later. Compatriot Smith’s memberships in lineal societies include: Sons of the Revolution; National Huguenot Society, of which he was President General for two years; Baronial Order of Magna Charta; Military\n\nOrder of the Crusades; Society of Colonial Wars; Sons and Daughters of the Pilgrims; Descendants of the Founders of Hartford; General Society of the War of 1812; Order of the Crown of Charlemagne in the U.S.A. and The National Society of Americans of Royal Descent. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the School of the Ozarks. Andrew McConnell, of the Kentucky militia, who gave his life in the “last battle of The Revolutionary War” at Blue Licks, Kentucky in 1782, was one of his ancestors.\n\nWalter Reville Martin of the Rhode Island Society was installed as President General on June 10, 1970 during the Eightieth Congress of the National Society at Houston, Texas. During his term he accepted all invitations that could be fitted into his schedule to make visitations to District, State, and Chapter events. This first-hand experiencing of SAR enthusiasm and hospitality was heartwarming. Prompted by his own observations, from contacts with compatriots, and in the course of administrative concerns at National Headquarters, President General Martin gave special attention to the following matters during his administration:\n\n1. Adoption of changes in the accounting system to make the financial reports of the Society more meaningful to the members.\n\n2. An increase of $1 in dues (from $5 to $6) to meet rising costs of the Society. This had been under consideration for some years, was deemed advisable by the Trustees, and subsequently was approved by the Congress.\n\n3. The desirability of providing an employee retirement plan was recognized. A committee named for the purpose produced an actuarially sound plan, subsequently recommended by the Trustees and approved by the Congress.\n\n4. The SAR Handbook of operating procedures, instructions, and other material was updated and published. The one in use was 13\n\nyears old.\n\n5. The Medals and Awards Program was updated and new guidelines issued. This was the work of William Y. Pryor, National Chairman of Medals and Awards. A series of plaques in tones of bronze, silver and gold was developed by the Chairman and the President General for awarding to individuals who enrolled five, ten, fifteen, or more new members. This program was to encourage and\n\nrecognize compatriots in the work of obtaining new members. Recipients’ names were inscribed on their plaques, which were presented for the first time at the 1971 Congress in Atlantic City.\n\n6. To strengthen the patriotic education purposes of the Society, in the spring of 1971, at the urging of Past President General Charles A. Anderson, M.D., the National Trustees adopted unanimously a resolution relating to the long and close association of the National Society with Patriotic Education, Inc. of Deland, Florida. The resolution urged that Patriotic Education, Inc.’s material for teaching the basic documents and other patriotic subjects be regularly listed in the SAR merchandise list and that the Trustees endorse an amendment to the NSSAR Constitution and By-laws for a permanent standing committee to be known as the Patriotic Education Committee. Subsequently, Compatriot Ralph H. Bowles, Chairman of the Committee, drew up a suggested program for implementation by State Societies -in fact, by all levels of the Society.\n\n7. The President General had become increasingly aware of the vast number of compatriots across the country with tremendous administrative and leadership capacity, and he felt strongly that the National Society should benefit from this resource. Further, many compatriots met during his travels asked how National officers were chosen. (There had been no National Nominating committee, it being the custom for the Past Presidents General to select in caucus the National officers to be recommended for election.) Compatriot Martin had believed for some time that a National Nominating Committee would bring forth a wider representation of leadership and create greater participation by the membership. Although such a committee did not come into being until 1975 at the Eighty-Sixth Congress in Boston, Massachusetts, the success of this approach proved its validity. President General Martin was gratified to have been able to plant some of the seeds to make it possible to involve the State societies, the chapters, and the entire membership.\n\n8. A Memorial Library Building Fund for an addition to the existing Headquarters building on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington,\n\nD.C., had been initiated several years previously and contributions urged. However, the changing neighborhood, economic conditions, and lack of adequate space, resulted in increasing support of the idea of relocating Headquarters. As one of several groups, President General Martin visited possible sites, none of which was further considered at that time.\n\nAfter the election, Judge Barnes postponed the usual Trustees meeting until the Congress delegates could go to Churchill Downs to see the famous Louisville horse races; one race was dedicated to SAR and one horse was named Martin. PPG Walter R. Martin thereupon placed a minimum bet of two dollars on the four-footed Martin definitely not a winner. As soon as Congress ended, Gradie R. Rowntree, M.D., who had been Chairman of the 88th Congress, asked the upcoming President General Chunn, PPGs Len Young Smith and Ryall Morgan to accompany him to Masonic headquarters. Without knowing the purpose other than a fraternal visit, the quartet went to the offices of the Kentucky Grand Lodge at Fourth and Kentucky Streets near downtown Louisville and there learned that the building was for sale. This Thursday morning visit turned into big changes for the Society, as described by\n\nthe Acquisition Chairman Martin, for it led eventually to the purchase of this fine limestone building for the National Headquarters. The Trustees voted to ask the Chancellor General to settle on a Jump sump with the Warren Woodwards for their money deposited for their retirement. The first official visit of President General Barnes was to the General Phileman Thomas Chapter of the Louisiana Society, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 12, 1977. He participated in that Chapter’s Seventh Annual Gold Good Citizenship Award Banquet as its principal speaker and presented the Gold Good Citizenship Medal to the Honorable Joe W. Sanders, Chief Justice of Louisiana. This was a thoroughly delightful affair and was an excellent and gracious way to begin a National Administration of the Sons of the American Revolution. The Executive Secretary of the National Society SAR, Warren A. Woodward, unexpectedly resigned that position on September 15, 1977, effective within thirty days, in order to accept a new position in Houston, Texas. He and his family departed shortly after October 15, 1977. Fortunately, the move from the National Society’s Headquarters in the District of Columbia to its temporary headquarters in the Huntington Building in Alexandria, Virginia, had been substantially completed, but the existing staff at National Headquarters also left the employment of the National Society shortly after the departure of Compatriot Woodward. This rather desperate situation was fortunately resolved by\n\nobtaining the services of Compatriot Lt. General Herman Nickerson, Jr., as acting Executive Secretary, whose appointment as Executive Secretary was confirmed by the N a tiona! Board of Trustees. General Nickerson performed brilliantly in the emergency, assembled an efficient staff, and kept the affairs of the National Society operating as smoothly as possible under quite difficult circumstances. The Special Real Estate Committee of the National Society, under the able Chairmanship of Compatriot Carl F. Bessent, worked hard during the Barnes Administration in gathering data and viewing sites for the Permanent Headquarters of the National Society.\n\nThe Report of that Committee was presented to the 88th Congress of the National Society held in Louisville, Kentucky. The President General visited many State Societies and Chapters during his term of office. Mrs. Barnes, because of her health, was unable to accompany him on all but three visits, and then with some difficulty. In all of the visits, the President General was warmly received and a spirit of good fellowship and hospitality prevailed. The National Society received excellent publicity in regard to many of these visits and addresses by the President General. Compatriot Joseph B. Head, Chairman of the Liberty Bell Committee, and Mrs. Head, continued their excellent work in visiting many schools in various States. Here again, the National Society received helpful publicity and the foundation was laid for future membership in the National Society. At the 88th Congress of the National Society, held in Louisville, Kentucky, from May 27-June 1, 1978, the Congress received the\n\nReport of the Special Real Estate Committee with its recommendation that the Permanent Headquarters of the National Society be established near-but not in-the nation’s capital. This recommendation was rejected by a substantial vote and thereafter the Congress established a National Headquarters Acquisition Committee with various well defined powers and with a view to bringing to a speedy cone! us ion the question of the location of the permanent headquarters. This was happily accomplished during the succeeding administration of Compatriot Calvin E. Chunn. The year of the Barnes Administration was an enjoyable one for President General Barnes. His health remained good, he had no accidents or difficulties in his travel arrangements and, as indicated, he was most graciously and well received by his Compatriots during all of his visits.\n\nCharles F. Printz, was born July 18, 1915, in Ranson WV, he was the son of Charles B. Printz and Mattie Booton Printz. PG Printz was committed to excellence in higher education. He graduated from Charles Town High School in 1934 and received a business degree from Shepherd College, in 1940. He taught briefly at Berkeley Springs High School and then entered West Virginia University, earning a Master of Business Administration in 1942. Following World War II, he was employed as associate professor of business administration at Shepherd University in 1947. He was appointed chairman of the Business Division in 1950, a position he held for 31 years until his retirement in 1981. His department, at one time, accounted for 31 percent of the enrollment of Shepherd University. While at Shepherd, Mr. Printz worked to raise admission and transfer standards. He founded Delta Sigma Pi, a business fraternity, directed the Shepherd Alumni Association and formed alumni chapters in all Eastern Panhandle and South Branch Valley counties. He was appointed to the board of the Shepherd University Foundation and as treasurer of the Scarborough Society. Following his retirement, he was appointed to and served on the West Virginia Board of Regents by former Gov. Arch Moore for five years. For his service in higher education, he was named Outstanding Alumnus at Shepherd University and an Outstanding West Virginian by Gov. Jay Rockefeller.\n\nDuring World War II, as a U.S. Navy ensign, he served aboard the USS Chincoteague, a seaplane tender, in the South Pacific, and was later assigned to the Seventh Fleet in Brisbane, Australia, where he worked in intelligence there and under Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s advanced headquarters in Papua New Guinea. He was then assigned to the Commander Service Force Pacific Fleet, the British Pacific Fleet and the Caribbean Sea Frontier in Miami, Fla., at the war’s end. He served on inactive duty as administrative personnel officer at Bolling Air Force Base and was promoted to commander in that position. He retired as a commander, United States Naval Reserves, in 1978.\n\nIn 1960, Mr. Printz became the first certified public accountant in the Eastern Panhandle. He was the owner of Charles F. Printz & Company CPAs. In addition to this accounting practice, he was actively involved in numerous business interests, including Kable Oil Company, Jefferson Finance Company, Peoples Supply and Peoples Supply Farm Machinery. He was appointed a director of Blakeley Bank and Trust Company and the Small Business Administration. Since 1972, he has owned and operated Aspen Pool Farm near Shepherdstown.\n\nActive in community affairs, he was a member of the Charles Town Kiwanis Club, where he served as president and as the district’s lieutenant governor. He was a member of the Shepherdstown Men’s Club, the Charles Town Lions Club and the Old Opera House. He was parishioner of Trinity Episcopal Church, Shepherdstown, where he served as treasurer for many years. He was a member of Malta Lodge No. 80, Charles Town. He was elected to one term on the Jefferson County Board of Education and served as recorder for the city of Charles Town. He is a founding member of the Gateway New Economy Council.\n\nPatriotism was important to Mr. Printz. He was part of the program at numerous Memorial Day ceremonies at Edge Hill Cemetery in Charles Town. He was commander of Post No. 71 of the American Legion in Charles Town and was chef de guerre of La Societe des Quarante Hommes et Huit Chevaux (Forty & Eight) in the Eastern Panhandle. He was active in the Retired Officers Association. He was president of the Virginia Society of the War of 1812 and was commander of the Henry Kyd Douglas Camp, Sons of Confederacy. He was dedicated to the Sons of the American Revolution. He was president general of the Adam Stephen Chapter, Sons of the American Revolution, from 1978 to 2009, building the chapter to more than 100 members, the largest in West Virginia. He was president general of the West Virginia Society, Sons of the American Revolution, during 1978 to 1981, and in 1988, was elected president general of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, the only West Virginian to hold that post. He was later honored with the National Society’s highest award, the Minuteman Award.\n\nAmong his hobbies was an avid interest in genealogy. After 20 years of research, he published “Into the Valley, a Printz Family History.”\n\nIn his own words: “June and I celebrated our 48th wedding anniversary on the day I was installed as President General. Milestones such as this gives one pause to reflect upon life. Life has been a series of challenges for me. As a baby, I was challenged to leave the crib and crawl. No sooner had I met that challenge, when Mom insisted I stand up and walk. Why walk? I was a champion crawler! Can you identify with these challenges? Yes, we all faced them. In time, we faced more serious challenges. There was the first day at school, the playground bully, and school tests. We could have lived without school tests. Challenges- there are so many. Remember the challenge of deciding on a career? Remember when you asked her to marry you? Remember your first job? Life is really a series of challenges! Who we are, and what we become, is decided by how we meet our challenges. This is true of individuals. It is also true of organizations. How we, the SAR respond to our challenges determines our character and effectiveness. The Internet has provided an unprecedented opportunity to introduce our programs to literally millions of young men and women. Are we up to the challenge? There are other challenges within our Society, just\n\nas important and necessary: Vice-Presidents General, I challenge you to get involved in membership recruitment. Make sure each state in your District has a membership goal. State Presidents, please make sure each chapter has a membership goal. Encourage and support them. The Illinois Color Guard came up with a postcard I like. The front shows a photo of our National Color Guard in front of the Alamo in Texas. Below the photo is a caption, “SAR needs a few good men.” I urge you to make this our motto for a National membership drive. I have another challenge for our Vice-Presidents General. Please get involved in our Veterans program. A major drive will be made by our Veterans Committee to involve every chapter and state in the program. This is your President General ‘s favorite program. To our State Societies, I challenge you to promote all programs of the NSSAR, and to participate in many of them. Establish an Internet web site and link with our National web site. A working society is a growing society. To our almost 500 chapters around the country, I challenge each of you to:\n\n1. Achieve your membership goal. 2. Reach out to the public and help them qualify for membership by holding a Genealogy workshop. Check out Compatriot Schweizer’s Lovely Course in Genealogy. It is just what you need.\n\n3. Have an annual SAR Information Workshop to train new officers. 4. Please give the Flag Award each year to an individual, or business, that flies Old Glory.\n\nI am counting upon all of you to accept these challenges. You have successfully met your personal challenges. Now your Society looks to you for SAR leadership. I know you will make us proud. At the National level, we will not start new programs. We will not add more committees. If we can’t get the job done with 58 committees, we have a problem more committees will not cure. We are going to concentrate on our core objectives of patriotism, history, and education. It amazes me to learn how much some of my\n\nCompatriots know about dues increases; the dates they occurred, and how much dues were raised. I am also amazed by the flood of proposed bylaw amendments every year. We seem to know our bylaws very well, especially those dealing with membership and money. Let me emphasize, there is nothing wrong with that. What concerns me, though, is how little we know about our history, our objectives, and the traditions of our Society. If we knew more, perhaps we would love her more and have fewer concerns about dues and bylaws. The challenge at the National level is more and better communications. We look forward to that challenge. Have we forgotten, perhaps we were never told, those glorious reasons for our founding? I wonder how many of our Chapters, or Chapter Presidents, even have an SAR Handbook? How do they learn? Working together, at national, state, and chapter level, let us face our SAR challenges with the undaunted resolution of our forefathers. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, “we do have a republic, if we can keep it, and its history, for our posterity.”\n\nIn his own words: “As I write this message, it has been a while since you gave me the opportunity to serve you as the 101st President General of our National Society. My endeavor will be throughout this year, to work together with the other Compatriots on our leadership team, to support our programs, our principles, our ideals and our great Nation. The 114th Annual Congress in Pittsburgh was one of the best attended events in our recent history. It proved to me that our members are sincerely concerned about the future of our Society. They were willing to be there to assure that the business of the SAR was conducted in a proper and open manner. I can pledge to you that your President General and all of our National Leaders will work together, in unity, without rancor, to further the goals of honoring our forefathers while promoting the patriotic spirit of America. As Benjamin Franklin said “We must all hang together, or we will surely hang separately.” In addition to the coordination of all endowment fund raising under the direction of our new Treasurer General, Nathan E. White, Jr., Secretary General Roland G. Downing will be organizing the archives and records of NSSAR to improve recovery of our historical records. The Secretary General will also be the Chairman of the NSSAR Strategic Planning Committee, developing new approaches to communications within our Society and new educational outreach programs that will utilize our Center for Advancing America ‘s Heritage to increase our impact on patriotic education and public understanding of American History. I would like to offer the opportunity to any interested Compatriot to participate in the efforts of our NSSAR Committees and working groups. Leadership and membership of our NSSAR Committees are listed elsewhere in this issue of The SAR Magazine. This will be a starting point for activities at our Trustees meeting in September. Additions and changes to these listings may be found on the NSSAR Web site at www.sar.org where we will try to maintain the most current listings as members are added to our Committees and leadership responsibilities are shifted during the year. Mary and I had a wonderful experience in New York and New Jersey immediately following the Pittsburgh Congress. We attended the 200th Anniversary . Commemoration of the death of Alexander Hamitlton, one of our most important and often under appreciated Founders. Hamilton was , in the words of Ron Chernow, the author of the current best selling biography, “the principle designer of the federal government, the catalyst for the emergence of the two-party political system, the patron saint of Wall Street, founder of the US Coast Guard, and pioneer of our modern bank.ing and financial systems .. . He was arguably the most important figure in American history who never attained the presidency, but he has a far more lasting impact than many who did.’ I was honored to be an invited guest at the Hamilton Family Reunion, Burr/Hamilton Duel reenactment, and Memorial Service, for Alexander Hamilton at Trinity Church in Manhattan· I represented the NSSAR as a speaker at the Memorial Service on Monday, July 12. An honor guard from the U.S. Coast Guard laid the memorial wreath on the grave of our Patriot Ancestor, and my wife Mary, great-great-great granddaughter of Hamilton, laid the memorial wreath on the grave of his wife, Eliza Schuyler Hamilton. We have been invited to return to New York on September 9, 2004, for a preopening reception for the six -month exhibition at the New-York Historical Society honoring Hamilton: soldier, patriot, statesman, and in the opinion of many, the founder of Modern America. The building in Manhattan that houses the N-YHS will be sheathed in a large replica of the $10 bill in time for the 2004 Republican National Convention. Please accept my gratitude for entrusting me with the top position in our National Society. I have always given my best efforts to the missions that have undertaken. You may expect no less during this next year as I coordinate the best teamwork with the best leadership that we have elected and appointed for the coming year.”\n\nIn his own words: “It is a great honor to have been elected as your President General. I thank all of you for your trust and confidence. I promise I will do all in my power to deserve it. The Congress at Williamsburg was one of the finest ever and I hope you enjoyed it as much as Theresa and I did. Larry Guzy and Joe Dooley deserve a great deal of credit for packing so much activity and accommodating so many people into the few days we had for the Congress. I believe attendance was the highest of all time at approximately 600 and I am particularly pleased that we had so many first time attendees. Theresa and I particularly enjoyed renewing the acquaintance of so many of you that we met during our SAR travels through the years. Now if we can only maintain the momentum and convert the enthusiasm of this Congress into increased participation in our programs\n\nat all levels. The work of our Society at the national level is accomplished in the national committees. We have more than 60 of them. This is where programs are managed and program policies are established. I urge each of you to become familiar with the programs of the SAR and participate in more programs within your chapters. This year we have a new Committee called Member Services which will consider for adoption commercial affinity agreements such as credit cards and travel clubs that will yield revenue for the SAR without cost or risk. Tom Lawrence of the Texas Society will chair this Committee. We have come a long way in our Society during the past several years. Because of our increasing awareness of the need for patriotic education in our nation we have adopted outreach education as a mission of the NSSAR. Our children, new immigrants, and the general public need to be educated about the founding of this great country and why it is so great. To this end we have hired an Education Director, Colleen Wilson, to lead us in these efforts. You have been reading about her programs in this magazine and some of you have been fortunate enough to hear her presentations about the work that is going on now at NSSAR Headquarters. As she travels around to District Meetings more of you will hear her stories of patriotic education at Headquarters. I don’t have to tell you about fundraising for the Center for Advancing America’s Heritage. By now you know what our objectives are and you are giving as much toward those objectives as you possibly can. By the time you read this we will hopefully have hired a Development Director to lead the charge toward raising enough to start construction before next summer. I know you support this effort and I know you will do everything in your power to make it happen. But our society is not just hard work. Social interaction is an integral part of most of our programs. Every historic commemoration includes a social gathering after the wreaths are presented. And we have some great get-togethers at the Leadership Meetings. In addition, this year we are planning an SAR trip to Scotland in May of 2008 to celebrate John Paul Jones and our English-Scottish heritage. In September 2008 there will be another trip to France to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris which ended the Revolutionary War. I hope as many of you as possible\n\ncan participate in one of these trips. The Sons of the American Revolution is a great organization and you are privileged to be a member of it. Please take full advantage of your membership and don’t just be a “certificate member”. Be a “participating member”. You will never regret it. See you down the road.”\n\nIn his own words: “Before any other comments for my first message to you as President General, I want to congratulate and thank again both the California Society and the National Congress Planning Committee for a great Congress in California! Raylene and I, and Bruce and I know Theresa, too, really appreciated everything. It was a job really well done. When I was 16 years old, my parents allowed me to drive by myself from our home in southern Missouri to visit my grandparents in Des Moines, Iowa. The day before I left, I called my grandfather for directions. He asked me if there was any other information I wanted to give him before he answered. I could think of nothing, so he then asked me where I was starting from, saying, “If I don’t know where you are, it’s going to be difficult to tell you where you need to go.” This was a great life lesson, and I often remember it! In fact, I would add to it that it’s often very helpful to also know where we’ve been (i.e. how we got here) as well as we are, before we begin a journey. So, let’s first think about where we’ve begin this last 119 years. Since our beginning, “patriotic education” has been a part of our purpose. It is my understanding that this particular purpose has received less emphasis at certain times in our history; but, I believe we now believe collectively that it is the primary reason for our existence. For that reason, in the past few years we’ve seen a real emphasis in our programs, dreams, and goals to ensure patriotic education is provided to our future generations. And, at least part of our dreams in this regard-the Center For Advancing American’s Heritage-has now moved from concept to reality. Many have worked hard to make this happen, and special credit must go our\n\nEducation Director Colleen Wilson. With The Center in existence and outreach patriotic education as our focus, we now have a greater need for expanded facilities that will also house our society headquarters, our foundation offices, a world-class genealogical library, and a world class museum. And to that end, last spring our trustees voted favorably to adopt a three phase plan.\n\nFirst, purchase the historic Fulton-Conway Building in the Louisville Museum District. (This was done, and we now refer to that facility as the Center.)\n\nSecond, build out of The Center would begin when sufficient funds were raised to do so. At Congress, the trustees further voted favorably to expend necessary funds to have detailed plans prepared for the build-out. And, in recognition for this commitment by the trustees, the SAR Foundation Board of Directors, charged with fundraising for this purpose, launched a new Capital Campaign chaired by Compatriot Sam Powell, NCSSAR. Details of that campaign are found elsewhere in this publication, but it is\n\nimportant to note that a “lead gift” to kickoff such a campaign is very important and through the exceptional effort of President General Roland Downing, a $1 million gift was secured from the William Drinkard Charitable Trust Fund. Details of Compatriot Drinkard’s remarkable life and his legacy are also found elsewhere in the publication.\n\nFinally, our existing facilities and adjoining property will be sold when the build out is complete. The proceeds from the sale will be the basis for the endowment fund to provide for administrative and operational needs in the future.\n\nSo, where are we now? We are clearly at a crossroads. We can simply say the task of raising the necessary funds is too great, and give up (something akin, I think, to George Washington saying it was just too cold and too difficult to cross the Delaware River and sending the Army home). Or, we can do whatever it takes to get the job done. Of course, we really don’t have a choice if we consider our oaths given to the society. Please remember the words you repeat several times annually, in our Pledge to the SAR and in our Recessional. We clearly have an obligation to defend against every foe, including apathy and indifference toward patriotic education in our educational institutions and in many American homes, and an obligation to stand up for what we believe and preserve the American way of life. How do we get where we need to be? What can and must we do? We have to continue the work in all our youth and teacher recognition programs; we have to continue building relationships with those organizations of like mind, e.g. the DAR, the CAR, and all our “Partners in Patriotism;” and we have to solidly establish the NSSAR and The Center as the leaders in our nation’s restoration of patriotic education. And, of course, we must focus on the critical tasks and not let ourselves, individually or collectively, to be distracted from them. Congratulations on all that you do and have done for our society and our nation. Keep it up-you are making a difference!\n\nIn his own words: “Evelyn and I want to congratulate the Ohio Society and Congress Planning Committee for organizing a historic 120th Annual Congress in Cleveland. Delegates were energized and inspired by the proceedings and return to their local communities dedicated to fulfilling the mission of our National Society. I am honored and humbled to serve as President General of our National Society for 2010-11. As a captain in the United States Army during the height of the Vietnam War, I learned\n\nthe importance of mission along the Lower Saigon River. Rest assured, as your President General, I will stay focused on SAR’s mission and will keep faith with the objectives of our founders to perpetuate the memory of the patriots of the American Revolution who achieved the independence of the American people How will I accomplish this? Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces in Europe on D-Day, former U.S. president and a distinguished Compatriot of our Society, said, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” So here’s what I’m planning First, we will make membership recruitment and retention our top priorities. There is no better way to perpetuate the memory of patriots of the American Revolution than to ensure that all their descendants join SAR and remain as members. While charging our Membership Committee to ramp up recruiting efforts, I have appointed a new committee that will focus entirely on membership retention. Second, we will reduce the size of our own bureaucracy, enhance efficiency, and prepare the next generation for leadership. The proliferation of national committees has outgrown the hotel facilities in Louisville, rendering many committee meetings ineffective. Committee leadership has remained virtually the same for years, and committee membership has not kept pace with changing leadership within our districts. In the interest of better utilizing meeting facilities, improving committee efficiency and effectiveness, and grooming the next generation of leadership for SAR, I have reduced the number and size of national committees, broadened membership to represent more districts, and appointed n~w committee leadership. I am hopeful that these changes will cultivate fresh ideas and reinvigorate our Society to remain relevant in a future that grows increasingly indifferent to our nation’s past. Third, we will finish what we started. Ten years ago, we recognized that our library, museum and administration had outgrown SAR’s headquarters in Louisville. We launched a fundraising campaign, acquired property for expansion and developed construction plans. Along the way, we realized that not only had SAR outgrown its facilities, but also that the American Revolution had outgrown the history books in our schools, colleges and universities. In response, we developed the Center for Advancing America’s Heritage to ensure that future generations would learn the lessons of our founders and the blessings of being an American. As Thomas Jefferson said, “Educate and inform the whole mass of the people … they are the only reliance for the preservation of our liberty.” Through the generosity of compatriots and patriotic corporations and foundations in Louisville and across America, we are nearing completion of Phase I construction and will dedicate the SAR Genealogical Research Library this fall. This dedication will mark a new beginning. The next phase of construction will include not only our museum but also our national headquarters and the Center for Advancing America’s Heritage. Your continued generosity and support will be required to see this through completion. Let’s finish what we started. Fourth, we will meet our national objective to inspire\n\nour communities with a more profound reverence for the principles of the government founded by our forefathers. We will build on the educational and patriotic outreach programs of my predecessors and see that the Center for Advancing America’s Heritage fulfills its promise to ensure that We The People remain faithful to the ideals of our founders and true to our founding documents. Fifth, in unity and fellowship, we will honor all who have served our nation and the cause of freedom-from our forebears who bestowed the blessings of liberty upon us to our sons and daughters who defend the cause of freedom today on distant shores. The core of this great organization over the past 60 years has been World War II veterans. Tom Brokaw wrote eloquently about those who grew up during the deprivation of the Great Depression and went on to defend our freedom in World War II. He accurately called them “The Greatest Generation.” I dedicate my presidency to them and salute their valor and patriotic service to our nation. This is my mission. These are my plans, and as Eisenhower said, it’s not the plan but the planning that leads to success. Now that the torch has passed from one President General to the next, I know of no higher duty than to keep alive the spark of patriotism that animated the heroes of the American Revolution. I pledge to keep faith with our founders and\n\nensure that SAR remains America’s premier patriotic, historical and educational organization. Let us live up to the patriotic principles of our Society and like the Liberty Bell, “Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all.”\n\nIn his own words: “Serving as your President General is a great honor. When I joined the SAR, I had no idea that someday I would\n\nbe serving you in this position. Billie and I want to express our gratitude for your support over the years. My primary goal is to continue advancing the objectives of this organization. The 124th Congress is behind us, and it was great! The Congress Planning Committee and the South Carolina Society are to be commended for an outstanding 124th Congress. We have virtually completed Phase II of our building program, but we still have a ways to go to realize our dream. Recent statistics indicate that more than 2 million people visit West Main Street in Louisville, Ky., annually, and we are confident that SAR will attract many of those visitors when our SAR Museum exhibits are ready for viewing. Sam Powell and Solid Light have created a campaign brochure to assist in raising the remaining funds needed for Phase III. This year, we will begin the SAR Patriot Ancestors’ Biographies Committee, which will be chaired by Doug Collins of the Kentucky Society. This will be another tool in recruiting new members, and it comports with one of the objectives of our society-that is, to perpetuate the memory of our patriot ancestors. The plan is to solicit biographical articles from our membership relating to their Revolutionary War ancestors and post those on our SAR website. Our IT committee assured me that our website can handle this project. Now, the duty is yours to write the stories. This is your chance to tell the world about your SAR ancestor and preserve that ancestor’s\n\nmemory. The site will be accessible to our members and visitors to peruse the biographies. Another new project that will be helpful to each member is the archiving of notable speeches given by our compatriots. Often, when one is asked to speak, the first response is: “I don’t have time to research and write a speech,” or “I don’t have a speech on that subject.” Archiving speeches should encourage more members to be willing to give a presentation to one of our chapters, state societies, or more importantly, to an outside organization. Bill Stone of the Alabama Society, chairman of the Library and Archives Committee, and Rae Ann Sauer, assistant librarian and archivist, will handle this task. Another project is identifying SAR Medal of Honor recipients, which began when President General Stephen A. Leishman was Historian General. Will Schrader of the KYSSAR will chair the newly formed SAR Medal of Honor Recipients Task Force. The members of this task force are hard at work. We need to recognize those SAR members who have received the Medal of Honor and place a memorial with their names in our museum. For this to be a success, we need SAR members and other volunteers to assist in the search for Medal of Honor recipients among our membership. Remember, there is a medal for this volunteer service.Education will always be one of our main objectives. We must continue to expand our educational outreach at the chapter, state and national levels. Colleen Wilson, our education director, has done a superb job, and we need to continue to grow in this area. We want to encourage each chapter and state to develop an outreach program whereby our members go into elementary, middle and high schools to promote the core principles of the founding of our country and the men and women who made it happen. You can be an important voice to preserve our patriotic history in our schools. We will continue to explore strategies that will enhance membership retention and reinstatements, because this will translate into growth of our membership. If your chapter or state has found something that works well for you in this area, please share it with other chapters and states. We must have a culture of continuous improvement, where solutions are shared and successes celebrated together in keeping our members connected after joining the SAR. Recruit, Retain and Reinstate should always be our theme for membership. Under the leadership of Chuck Sweeney of the Florida Society, we will continue the work of the Veterans Recognition Committee, which is recognizing the military service of our members to our country. To date, we have recognized compatriots who served during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. During my term as President General, we will recognize those who served in the Persian Gulf War. Plans are to begin a Veterans Recognition Committee Newsletter, issued at least three times annually, to keep our veterans and leadership informed of the various ongoing recognition programs. Although these are my goals for the SAR for the coming year, the goals can only come about with your help. Thank you for all you are going to do this year for the SAR and may God bless the SAR and these United States of America.”\n\nIn his own words: “Thank you for your confidence by electing me President General. Let me introduce you to my family. Our daughter, Bridgett Harsgaard, is a consultant living in New York City with our grandchildren, Lizzie and Gracie. Gracie is 7 and plays baseball-not T-ball or softball. She is a catcher and shortstop and a good hitter with her own Louisville Slugger bat. Lizzie is 12 and a ballerina. She has danced with the American School of Ballet and the New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center. She is going to study with the Paris Opera Ballet. Many friends and compatriots have worked hard to make this society one of the strongest lineage and patriotic organizations. Organizations that want to make a difference, to be great, must have dreams and set lofty goals. There has been much discussion about the Solid Light proposal for the main-floor education center, our need to\n\nmove forward aggressively with outreach education, to finish construction on our building, and the need for new software and a new website. While raising money and renovating the Library and Headquarters building, we were all pretty much on the same page, but when we completed enough of the building to move in, it became clear there were differing opinions about what to do next. This is like when our Patriot ancestors were united to achieve independence but then became divided over the course to follow after we won the war. And like our founding fathers, we will come together, and here is how I think we can do it. To make the best decision possible I will appoint an SAR Implementation Committee to look at our options and make recommendations at the Spring Leadership Meeting. The committee should have the final Solid Light plan by then; they already have the University of Louisville business plan, a better plan for outreach education and updated IT plans. The committee will be chaired by PG Nathan White and will include principal stakeholders, including the SAR Foundation; the IT Committee; representatives from Education, Budget and Strategic Planning committees; the museum board; and our new Governance and Organization Committee. They will review our existing plans and suggest options for consideration. We have to make decisions about what type of exhibit space we will have, how to proceed with completing construction, how to develop and make our outreach education programs national in scope, and how to complete our IT systems. Another focus will be to bolster our SAR legacy. We all hope to leave a legacy to be remembered. We have legacies with our family, our jobs and our church, but another important legacy is our SAR legacy. How many lives will we touch? How many seeds of patriotism will we plant? It is through young people that we build our SAR legacy, and we do it with our youth programs. I am not minimizing the importance of our color guard or public service awards or any other programs, but if we want to preserve the vision of our founding fathers, we must reach our youth. When we go to a school and put on a program or sponsor a poster or oration contest, or when Tom Green from Texas puts on a flag program, we touch students’ lives and give them an opportunity to learn about Paul Revere’s ride, the Battle of Yorktown or a brave young wife named Molly Pitcher. Going to the trouble to help them leaves a lasting impression that the American Revolution is important enough for you to take the time to come out and talk about it. It is hard work to set up these programs, but it is incredibly rewarding, and we know that by doing this we make this country stronger and ensure that our descendants will continue to enjoy the freedoms Thomas\n\nJefferson and Thomas Paine wrote about so eloquently, and Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams spoke about so passionately. Our youth programs are strong and led by dedicated compatriots, but not all states fully participate. Committee members have always talked informally, but I think we would benefit from a structured exchange. I will form a Council of Youth Programs that will include the chairmen of the eight youth programs-the poster contest, middle school brochure contest, C.A.R. award, Eagle Scout award, essay, oration, JROTC and the American History Teacher award. Dr. Rudy Byrd will chair the council, and its members will help one another’s programs. I ask that they design a brochure featuring all eight programs that can be handed out in schools. This brochure can be put on our website so chapters and states can download it, add their contact information and print it themselves. As encouragement, any state society that submits at least four candidates for a youth program national contest will receive a streamer. For any state societies that submit an entry for all eight contests I will personally write a check for $250 to that society’s youth program budget. For states that submit candidates for all eight programs I will write another check for $250 if any of their candidates win. Don’t worry about the money; it is coining out of Mickey Jo’s shoe budget. I ask this council to post the winning essays and speeches on the website as well as information about current and past winners. The committee chairmen should record videos so chapters and states can access them on our website and see the benefits and learn how to set up a youth program. I would like to mention three other ideas before I close education, the way our committees function, and our basic governance and organizational structure. One of the first things the new regime does when it takes over the government is to change what the kids are taught in school. They now learn that ~he old government was bad and the new leaders are heroes. Textbooks are rewritten, teachers re-educated, and new pictures put up in the schoolhouses. If you teach history in a certain way long enough, school children begin to believe it, so our fight is over how the history of the American Revolution is taught. Not only do we need to make sure it is adequately covered, but we need to see it is accurately portrayed. I am asking\n\nthe Education Committee to add a subcommittee to map out a strategy to exert influence on how textbooks and web-based learning programs are written and selected. Tom Jackson from Texas is to chair this subcommittee. He is an elected school board member from one of the largest suburban school districts in the country, with more than 112,000 students. Anyone interested in this project should contact Education Committee Chairman Larry Stevens or Tom Jackson. Next, it clearly impossible to get all of our committee work done on a Friday at Leadership Meetings. Every new PG tries to improve efficiency by dissolving some committees and creating new ones, but I think we need to change the corporate culture. To help the committees, I am appointing Mike Elston of Virginia as a committee coordinator. He will work.with the committee chairmen to set and meet goals, submit budgets, assist them in holding meetings with teleconferences and gotomeeting.com and introduce them to working with Sharefile for document access. He will make sure committee concerns needing immediate attention are brought to the Excom and PG. To allow our members to attend all the necessary committee meetings and allow sufficient time for the trustee meetings, we will start on Thursday with a social activity on Thursday night. Lastly, I want to look at our governance and organizational structure. As you know, we have a Congressional Charter, which is prestigious but limiting. We have the SAR Foundation, which is chartered in Kentucky, and we have the right to use the CAAH name, so we have laws and rules we must follow. Questions have come up about our corporate structures in regard to liability, accepting donations from charitable entities, whether we have the exclusive right to use all of the potential operating names we need, and whether our system of governance still makes sense. I am appointing three of our best lawyers-John Dodd, Davis Wright and PG David Appleby-to seek answers and report to us by the Spring Leadership Meeting with suggestions or proposed changes. I often find myself reading the obituaries. I love to see where people were born and what they did. I look for their military service. I notice their work history, sometimes being impressed if they were a doctor, a partner in a big law firm or the president of a corporation. I increasingly search for what they did to help their community. When you read an obituary, you see the year a person was born, a dash, and then the year that person died. The\n\ndash represents the individual’s life. My wife, Mickey Jo, told me about a poem titled “Dash Between the Years,” from which I quote:\n\n“For it matters not how much we own..,the cars … the house. .. the cash What matters is how we live and love and’ how we spend our dash”\n\nHow do you want to spend the rest of your dash? The fact that you are an SAR member indicates you love this country, you care about its future, and you respect the ideals of our founding fathers and mothers. If we want this country to continue to look like Washington and Adams and Jefferson envisioned it, then we must ensure that our young people understand their vision and love our country as we do. The best way for us to do this is through our youth programs. You will agree that instilling in our young people the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence and a love of the freedoms in our Constitution is worth some of your dash. I close with a final thought about what makes an organization great. It is not how many members you have, although people join organizations that do worthwhile things. It is not how much money you have, although people tend to vote with their pocketbook and give when they think their money will be used for beneficial purposes. Organizations are great when they help people or influence positive and fundamental change. Our chance for the SAR to be great is to inspire this great country to continue to follow the patriotic vision of our founding fathers. Those of us who have contributed money and valuable time to preserve the principles of the American Revolution recognize our country’s future is dependent on those principles remaining the cornerstone of our government and national vision. We must dream the same dream that George Washington, John Adams and our Patriot ancestors dreamed, and work to make their sacrifices count and ensure that today’s youth understand those dreams.\n\nIt is a humbling honor to be elected President General, and Mickey Jo and I look forward to this year and hope to see many of you in your home states soon. God bless you.”\n\nIn his own words: “It is an honor and a privilege to serve as your 113th President General of the National Society Sons of the American Revolution. I am humbled and I appreciate the confidence you have bestowed upon me by electing me to this position. I am excited to serve you and this worthy organization. I take great pride in that I am a member of the SAR. This is your society and each of us has an important role to play. We should take every opportunity to educate the public on who we are and why we are relevant. I believe we can increase our identity and have the SAR become more recognizable to the public. Over the years, a lot of our compatriots and colleagues have worked hard to make this organization into the largest, strongest and best society that it can be. However, there is still a lot of work to do, both now and into our future. At the Spring Leadership and Trustees meeting, we took an important step into the future. We engaged in discernment and debate of the proposal, and then the Trustees voted to pay the final installment of the interpretive plan to Solid Light and approved moving ahead with the Educational Outreach Center, when we have the money in hand. I believe that our compatriots, like our Patriot ancestors, came away from this session with an overall appreciation of the process and agreed to move forward. This facility will be a wonderful addition to our society, not only now, but into the future of our organization. With our headquarters located on Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, among numerous museums and tourist attractions, this Educational Outreach Center will not only enhance our visibility, but should attract new prospective members who visit the area. Visitors could tour our educational center and then exit next door to our library to conduct research on their own family history. I will continue the Implementation Committee that PG Lawrence started. This will be chaired by PG Nathan White. This committee will continue to be made up of stakeholders from the following: SAR Foundation and the IT, Education, Budget, Finance, and Strategic Planning committees. They will continue to review our existing plans, programs and needs as we progress into the future and continue to prioritize them. The committee will continue to set forth and present to the ExCom and Trustees a list of priorities. I am also continuing the following committees and programs, which were in place before I was elected:\n\n• Compatriot Doug Collins will continue as chair the Patriot Ancestors’ Biographies. • PG Brock will chair SAR Medal of Honor Recipients and work to finish this project.\n\n• Compatriot Chuck Sweeney will chair the Veterans Recognition Committee. • Compatriot Paul Callanan will chair the Congress Review Committee.\n\n• Compatriot Dr. Rudy Byrd will chair the Council of Youth Awards. • Compatriot John Dodd will chair the Governance and Organization Committee.\n\nAn important part of the SAR mission is patriotic education and therefore it is our responsibility to share our knowledge of the founding of this country and the struggles of our forefathers and ancestors. That is why my first initiative is Education Outreach. To enhance our Educational Outreach beyond the borders of Louisville, this new Educational Outreach Team initiative will extend this mission into our chapters and reach out to the children in their schools, Scout organizations, civil groups, religious institutions and other patriotic societies. The long-range goal of this initiative is to develop and share educational program presentations by SAR members. These presentations would be Colonial Living History (era before or during the American Revolution), a discussion about our founding documents, presentations on battles or personalities, or other appropriate patriotic programs targeted for children. The long-term goal is to have an NSSAR database of all Educational Outreach Teams and their programs. This would enable educators to access a database of our nationwide programs, including contact information and scripts and/or videos. NSSAR Education Director Colleen Wilson, Brooks Lyles, Educational Committee chairman; Bill Stone, Educational Outreach Center production chair; and Tom Jackson, Web based Educational Learning Subcommittee chair and others on the NSSAR Educational Team will work together to develop this initiative. The NSSAR educational director could assist in the developing of new presentations. The details of this long-range initiative can be found on the NSSAR website. There will be two levels of the program, one for those chapters that have never offered an educational outreach program and the other for those chapters that already have an educational program in place. The basic requirements are the same and will require chapters to share their program information with NSSAR to be included in the national education website. Streamers will be available for those chapters that complete this initiative between now and May 31, 2017. But this initiative does not stop in 2017. It continues for many years into the future. My next initiative is the Mentor Program. When does the mentor process begin? It begins when a new prospective member inquires/seeks information on becoming a member of the Sons of the American Revolution by a casual conversation, email inquiry, or responds to an ad in the local paper. At that time, the process should be an offer to assist or a referral to a mentor in the chapter. The president should have a list of mentors in the chapter to assist in this endeavor. Each chapter should have mentors regardless of chapter size. The mentor should assist the applicant through the process of acceptance and continue on once he becomes a member to assimilate the new member, ensuring a meaningful relationship with the current members and a commitment to the mission of the society. It has been recognized that the retention rate of members, especially new members, should be increased. I believe the retention rate may be significantly increased by involving a new member in the chapter’s activities. The mentoring of members is a responsibility of all SAR members and especially the first-line sponsor and chapter. Therefore, I am asking the Membership Committee to spearhead this project. I am requesting that they review their policies, pamphlets and brochures and bring them up to date. Their publications should be “eye catching.” I would charge the Membership Committee to work with the Medals and Awards Committee to look into the possibility of tying a portion of this program to the Liberty Medal. The goal of this initiative is to create an effective mentorship program, which will enhance not only our enrollment numbers but the quality and quantity of our SAR programs. Our youth programs continue to be strong. We continue to have strong leadership in these committees. Our Council of Youth Award’s has put together a wonderful brochure listing all of Youth Awards. I am aware that additional money is required to increase the awards provided by the various programs. Therefore, I am issuing a challenge to each state society to donate $1,000 or more to the Council of Youth Awards (not to the individual youth programs) between now and June 1, 2017. Those states that meet the $1,000 challenge will receive a streamer. If 100 percent of the state societies donate $1,000, Cilia and I will donate $10,000 or more to the Council of Youth Awards. The total donations would then be divided among the various programs. I would charge the committee to look at the various programs and determine how to equalize the awards. (Last year, PG Lawrence funded such initiatives from First Lady Mickey Jo Lawrence’s shoe budget. Cilia doesn’t have a shoe budget, so I guess we’ll have to raid her Colonial-attire budget.) Our NSSAR Children of the American Revolution program continues to grow. I am asking Chairman Darrin Schmidt to make sure that each state society has a state C.A.R. chairman. I would like the state C.A.R. chairman to encourage each chapter to create a C.A.R. liaison. Chapters should encourage SAR members to become senior leaders in the local and state C.A.R. societies, as well as at the national level. I would like each SAR chapter to enroll C.A.R. members as junior members in our society. Once they become SAR junior members, the chapters are encouraged to get them involved in our committees. Many of the C.A.R. members are already serving on committees in the C.A.R., so why not with the SAR? This would increase our membership. Once the Junior Member ages out, they would continue on into the parent organization. This year the National Park Service is celebrating its 100th year. This is a wonderful opportunity for the Historic Site and Celebrations Committee to build our relationship with the Park Service and partner with it in its year of celebration. The Park Service is engaging in a campaign to reintroduce the national parks and the work of the National Park Service to a new generation of Americans. Therefore, I am issuing a challenge to the Historic Site and Celebrations Committee to build upon our relationship with the National Park Service. Many of our American Revolutionary historic sites our maintained by the Park Service and with our increased involvement, this would bring increased visibility and promotion of the SAR to a potential new member base. In closing, I would like to reflect on the exceptional members we have in the SAR. We have all given of our time, talents and financial assets to make this organization prominent. Now is our opportunity to take the SAR to a new level and commitment. We must continue to promote the SAR to the public, so that we are recognizable. We must constantly tell our ancestors’ stories and those of the early Patriots who fought for our independence. We live in the greatest country and enjoy the freedoms that our forefathers fought for more than 230 years ago. We are obligated to continue to preserve our heritage, our mission, and the historic principles upon which this country was founded. I ask that you please keep Cilia and me in your thoughts and prayers as we travel this great nation to carry out the business of our society. We both look forward to a wonderful year. Thank you once again for the confidence you have placed in me. I look forward to working alongside you for our Society, a society of gentlemen, the Sons of the American Revolution. God Bless America and each of you.”\n\nIn his own words: “I am honored to represent you as the 116th President General of the Sons of the American Revolution. The President General is the face of the national society and travels across the country to attend the many and varied events at the district, state and chapter levels. This, I believe, is one of the most important tasks of the President General. All the good work of our society begins in our own communities. Grave markings, parades and school programs, to name a few activities, shine a spotlight on our mission. These events, held at the local level, are what defines the SAR and educates all who attend them. I look forward to representing the SAR across the country at these events. Being there will let those who plan and implement these programs know that all their hard work is appreciated and recognized at the national level. Since becoming a member of the SAR, I have been very involved. Starting at the state level, I have served as state secretary, president and national trustee. I also had the honor of serving as VPG of the New England District. Once I became active at the national level, I served on several boards and committees. Many of you may know me through my daily history messages. I have always been passionate about history, and discovering that my ancestors played a role in the fight for independence has enriched my life in so many ways. To be able to stand here before you as President General is humbling. I hope to expand on the good works of those who served before me and carry on the mission of the SAR. I would like to thank the staff of our National Headquarters. They are the folks who keep the\n\norganization running efficiently on a day-to-day basis. Many of us interact with the staff only briefly at Congress and Leadership; however, as a general officer serving in different capacities, I have seen firsthand their dedication and hard work. I would also like to thank Steve Vest for his outstanding work on The SAR Magazine. To those general officers I have served closely with these last few years, I thank you for the time and effort which you put into your position and the teamwork that has served the society so well. To all committee members, thank you for stepping up to serve and work on these important boards and committees. I cannot emphasize enough that the SAR would not work if not for all the volunteers who share their time and talent. It is not about any one person; it is about the membership as a whole. Thank you to David Perkins, recording\n\nsecretary, for his outstanding work this past year. This last year, it has been an honor and a pleasure to work with President General Warren Alter. Warren has worked tirelessly for the SAR and has accomplished a great deal this last year alone. If you have read your SAR Magazine during his tenure, you know how far we have come. I could not follow a more dedicated and passionate leader than Warren. He and I have been on the same page regarding many issues, the main one being carrying out the support and vote of the trustees to continue the work on the Education Center and Museum. PG Alter has kept the lines of communication with the general officers and VPGs open, and I will continue with that practice as well, with teleconferences between Leaderships and\n\nCongress as needed. I recall, when I was a new member of the SAR, the then-President General visiting Massachusetts for one of our events, and how important his presence was to the compatriots who attended. It is that which I look forward to the most—meeting the membership in their home states and participating in their events and, as I said earlier, representing the National Society. When I joined the SAR, I did not know what to expect. I knew I wanted to become an active member, but I did not envision being involved beyond my state and chapter. That was 25 years ago. In those 25 years, having taken on the duties that brought me to a Leadership meeting and a Congress, I was hooked. It was the people we met, and the friendships that developed,\n\njust as much as the work we were doing that kept me coming back year after year. It has enriched our lives. I also want to thank the California Society for all the work they have done to make this Congress such a success. I look forward to seeing many of you along the way this year in my travels, and making new friends, as well. We ask that you keep us in your prayers for health and safe travels—and, while you are at it, for a mild winter and no flight cancellations due to snow!”"
