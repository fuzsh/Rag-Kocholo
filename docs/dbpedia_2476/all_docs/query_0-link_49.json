He is credited with the discovery of unique and distinctive aspects of the sound system of the language of the Marshall Islands, has produced (together with three co-authors from the islands) a Marshallese-English dictionary, and is currently working on a reference book on Marshallese grammar. Much of his research in recent years has focused on Micronesian as a subgroup within the Austronesian language family (coordinate, for example, with Polynesian); This has involved the collection of a large computerized database of cognates in Micronesian languages.\n\nAlfred Capelle is a Marshallese educator, the former Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) Ambassador to the UN, and co-author with Dr. Bender of the Marshallese-English dictionary.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to assist students from the Marshall Islands to attend the University of Hawai'i.\n\nCriteria\n\nFull-time, undergraduate students enrolled at any campus in the University of Hawai'i System\n\nCitizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands\n\nCumulative grade point average of 2.5 or above\n\nFinancial need shall be a criterion in making this award although not necessarily as defined by federal guidelines\n\nLetter of recommendation\n\nPersonal statement of academic intent\n\nPreference given to students who express interest in creative writing\n\nmarshallese, marshall islands, creative writing, uhm, uh manoa, manoa, university of hawaii at manoa, uhh, uh hilo, hilo, university of hawaii at hilo, uhwo, uh west oahu, west oahu, university of hawaii west oahu, hcc, honcc, honolulu cc, honolulu community college, haw cc, hawcc, hawaii cc, hawaii community college, lcc, leeward cc, leeward, leeward community college, kcc, kapiolani cc, kapiolani, kapiolani community college, kaucc, kauai cc, kauai, kauai community college, maui cc, uh maui, maui community college, uh maui college, maui community college, maui, wcc, windward cc, windward, windward community college,\n\n48958, 48959, 48960, 48961, 48962, 48963, 48964, 48965, 48966, 48967, 49452, 202547, 202591, 296241\n\nAlice Oda Tamura Scholarship\n\nAlice Fujie Oda Tamura was born in Kealia, Kaua'i in 1927. She was a graduate of Kapa'a High School and Honolulu Business School. She completed her secretarial training program in 1948 and started her career at Fort Shafter. In November 1951, she moved back to Kaua'i and began her 30+ year career working in hospital settings by accepting a position in the administrative offices at Wilcox Memorial Hospital. For three years Alice became almost totally immersed in hospital life while living with the nurses in their quarters on the hospital grounds. For Alice, living and working at Wilcox Hospital resulted in friendships with nurses that endured over the years and a growing identification with the medical professions.\n\nMarriage to Bunki Tamura took Alice back to Honolulu where she took a position as secretary in the Queen's Hospital School of Nursing, until after its closure, then she was transferred to the hospital's administrative offices and worked as a secretary until she retired in 1982.\n\nAlice admired, respected and trusted nurses. She had intimate knowledge of the work that they did and especially was respectful of the rigorous education and training that they received in the School of Nursing. Alice regarded the years that she worked as the secretary of the School of Nursing as the golden years of her career.\n\nAlice passed away March 9, 1998. The donor of this fund would like to pay tribute to her sister by establishing this scholarship for students who aspire to become nurses.\n\nThe purpose of this fund is to provide scholarships to students who are enrolled in the Associate in Science degree in Nursing program at Kapiolani Community College.

She graduated from Maui High School and married her high school sweetheart Willard Nagata and began a family with three children. For 40+ years she was a cannery worker for the Maui Land and Pineapple Company.\n\nAlice was a sweet, gentle, generous and loving person who, in her quiet way, lived life fully. She worked very hard at the pineapple cannery, raised her three children and enjoyed her hobby of raising plants and Japanese flower arranging \"ikebana\". After retiring in 1995, she was very active in many senior activities and learned to dance the hula, play the ukulele, learned oil painting and sang in the Kahului Union Church Chancellor Choir. She especially enjoyed being a grandma to her two grandchildren. Alice also enjoyed traveling to the mainland, especially California to see her sisters and brothers.\n\nIn 2001, Alice suffered from an episode of severe depression and fully recovered. She resumed her usual hobbies and traveled to the mainland and abroad to Europe to visit her grandson. Then, in 2008, she had a second episode of depression which resulted in multi-organ failure due to dehydration and her passing on July 23, 2008.\n\nWith Alice's situation on Maui in 2001 and 2008 there were very limited qualified geriatric resources for her and her family.

He was the second of four children and was a respectful and loving son and brother. He attended Waianae High School and served as class president during his sophomore and junior years. After graduating from high school in 1965, he attended Honolulu Community College and studied drafting. In 1967 he earned his Associate Degree in Science in Drafting.\n\nDuring this time, the Vietnam conflict was on, so he decided to protect the home front and joined the U.S. Army Reserve Unit of the Hawai'i National Guard. He went to Fort Ord, California for basic training and was singled out for officer training school. However, since he had no intention of making the military his life's career, he declined the offer. Upon his return from basic training, he was employed by Hawaiian Telephone Co., and life was going according to plan.\n\nThen suddenly in 1969, the Hawai'i National Guard and the Arkansas National Guard were activated. He quickly married his sweetheart, and ten days later he was deployed to Vietnam. Shortly upon his arrival, he was made a platoon leader and on May 20, 1969 he was killed in a combat operation protecting his men on Hamburger Hill near Thua Thien. He was laid to rest with military honors at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl, Hawai'i. His name is etched on the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C. as well as on a pedestal at the Vietnam War Memorial on the grounds of the State Capitol in Honolulu. For his valor, he was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Silver Star, and an education building was dedicated and named after him at the U.S. Army Reserve Center at Fort Shafter Flats in Honolulu.\n\nThe purpose of this Fund is to provide scholarships to students pursuing certificates or degrees in a Career and Technical Education Program at Honolulu Community College.
