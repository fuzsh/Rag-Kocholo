        "text": "Casualties\n\nBy Elizabeth Marro ’78\n\nBerkley, 2016\n\nDuring an interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune, Marro was asked what got her thinking about this book. She answered, “I wish I could just point to one simple thing, but I think it was sort of how a bunch of things came together. My background as a journalist. My role as a pharmaceutical executive. We moved from New Jersey to San Diego in March of 2001, and we went to war the next year. My antennae were just quivering in all kinds of ways, asking me to pay attention.\n\n“You’ve probably heard this from other authors, but you know how you start with your worst nightmare and you kind of figure it out on the page? I’m a mother, a mother of a son, and I raised him by myself. I’ve thought about how people who go to war do it, but what about the parents? How do they do it? What goes on in the heart and the mind of somebody who thinks that she’s got her whole life figured out and she doesn’t? I wanted to explore that.”\n\nOne of the book’s reviewers, Caroline Leavitt, New York Times bestselling author of Is This Tomorrow and Pictures of You, writes, “How do you survive the unendurable? Marro’s gorgeous debut is about war, grief, guilt, and grappling with the truths you don't expect, and finally taking the risk and acknowledging the ones that you do. Moving and full of heart.”\n\nTim Keefe: A Biography of the Hall of Fame Pitcher and Player-Rights Advocate\n\nBy Charlie Bevis ’75\n\nMcFarland, 2015\n\nBevis says, “Tim Keefe was not just an outstanding baseball pitcher in the 1880s but also an artisan steeped in the independent nature of the apprentice-journeyman-master system that his father and he had worked in as carpenters. Keefe was a knowledge worker, not just a man who threw a baseball. As a master craftsman, he wrote two treatises on pitching strategy, taught his craft to college players at Harvard, and operated his own sporting goods business. Most intriguing to me was that Keefe was so miffed at the diminution of his baseball job by the capitalists of the emerging industrial revolution that he helped to establish the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, an ill-fated precursor to today’s athlete unions.“\n\nBevis is a member of the Society for American Baseball Research. He has written for Nine, The Cooperstown Symposium, The National Pastime and Base Ball, and he is the author of several baseball books. He is an adjunct professor of English at River University and University of Massachusetts-Lowell.\n\nHope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland\n\nBy Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, Mary Jordan, and Kevin Sullivan '81\n\nViking, 2015\n\nSullivan, senior correspondent for The Washington Post, and Mary Jordan, national political correspondent for the Post, worked with Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus on Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, published by Viking. In this book Berry and DeJesus, two women kidnapped by infamous Cleveland school-bus driver Ariel Castro, share the stories of their abductions, captivity, and dramatic escape.\n\nSullivan says he and his wife, Jordan, got involved in the project because the lawyers for Berry and DeJesus knew the two journalists, and brought them together with the two women “to see if we clicked, and we did.”\n\n“So the four of us decided we would take on this project together. We spent hundreds of hours with them over the last year and a half, gaining their trust and helping them tell their story. The most rewarding part of this project has been getting to know these two young women. They were totally ordinary girls—Gina was 14 and in the 7th grade, and Amanda was 16 and working at Burger King—when they were taken and thrust into this unfathomably horrible experience. Yet somehow they found absolutely extraordinary strength and reliance inside themselves. They never gave up hope and they managed to outlast their captor. It was truly an inspiration for me and Mary,” says Sullivan.\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer says the book is “[A] breathtaking accomplishment. What could have been a record of two victims who endure the unendurable at the hands of a monster, is, instead, the story of two young and frightened girls as they come of age and, against all odds, come to an understanding of themselves and their tormenter. They emerge from the house on Seymour Avenue with an insight and compassion that many adults never grasp.”\n\nThe book is now in its fourth week at the top of The New York Times best-seller list.\n\nWrite Choices: Elements of Nonfiction Storytelling\n\nBy Sue Hertz '78\n\nCQ Press, 2015\n\nUNH Professor Hertz is author of Write Choices: Elements of Nonfiction Storytelling, published by CQ Press.\n\nHertz says, “After years of teaching graduate and undergraduate nonfiction writing courses, I grew frustrated with the walls that academia had placed between the narrative nonfiction forms. Based on my own writing and reading and teaching, it struck me that writers of all the forms, from memoir to personal essay to narrative journalism to video and podcasts, faced the same questions at the same junctures in the storytelling process. We all need to find an idea, and content, and a focus. We all need to create a structure that will lure the reader from beginning to end. And we all need to face the myriad of other storytelling choices, from who is the narrator to what tense is most effective.\n\n“And then, of course, are all the choices included in revision. Write Choices seemed a common sense approach to nonfiction storytelling, a celebration of all that the forms share rather than focus on what divides them. And because I love hearing other people's stories, I interviewed over 75 nonfiction artists, from journalists to memoirists to videographers and photo essayists.“\n\nOne of the book’s reviewers, Benoit Denizet-Lewis, New York Times Magazine writer and assistant professor of writing and publishing at Emerson College, says, “To write well is hard. To teach writing well might, remarkably, be harder. Sue Hertz has written a gem of a book that makes both the writing and teaching of nonfiction storytelling easier. Write Choices is required reading in my magazine and nonfiction writing classes.”\n\nThe Great Fire, One American's Mission to Rescue Victims of the 20th Century's First Genocide\n\nBy Lou Ureneck '72\n\nHarper Collins, 2015\n\nUreneck, professor of journalism at Boston University, is author of The Great Fire, One American's Mission to Rescue Victims of the 20th Century's First Genocide, published by HarperCollins. Ureneck says he began the project, about the rescue of tens of thousands of refugees during the genocide that swept Turkey, because he wanted to tell the story of Asa Jennings, a Methodist pastor from upstate New York who in 1922 commanded the evacuation of 350,000 helpless refugees from the shores of Smyrna (today İzmir) in Turkey following the Great Fire of Smyrna.\n\nThe Asa Jennings story “struck me as one of the great stories of an American hero that hardly anyone knows about,” says Ureneck. “So the research began with Jennings but soon branched out to others who were present at Smyrna for the fire and rescue. The research broadened also into an exploration of America's response to the century's first genocide.\n\n“The challenge was mastering a lot of material so I could write with authority. I spent four years doing the research and drew from archives in five countries. I made four trips to Greece and Turkey. Language was sometimes an obstacle. Turkish records in the period were written in Turkish but rendered in Arabic script. This required me to hire a translator to sit next to me as I went through newspapers at the Izmir (Turkey) archives.\n\nUreneck adds, “The work was tremendously satisfying. I feel that I've told an important story. How well I've told it -- well, I will leave that to readers. But I feel fortunate to have been supported in this work by HarperCollins, which provided the advance that allowed me to travel to distant libraries to read the original documents that form the narrative of the story.”\n\nPublisher’s Weekly calls The Great Fire “fresh, haunting, and potent.”\n\nCabin: Two Brothers, a Dream, and Five Acres in Maine\n\nBy Lou Ureneck '72\n\nViking Adult, 2011\n\nA reviewer for The Boston Globe writes that “in his newest book, ‘Cabin,’ Ureneck heads to the Maine woods on a Thoreauvian mission to simplify life and find his truest self by building a lakeside cabin. But unlike Concord’s legendary recluse, Ureneck forges a powerful bond with his brother and his family… In “Cabin,’’ Lou Ureneck has created something bracing, beautiful, and profoundly heart-felt.”\n\nAugust Gale: A Father and Daughter’s Journey into the Storm\n\nBy Barbara Walsh '81\n\nGlobe Pequot, October 2011\n\nAmazon.com describes \"August Gale\" as \"about two heartrending odysseys: one into a deadly Newfoundland hurricane and the lives of schooner fishermen who relied on God and the wind to carry them home; the other, into a squall stirred by a man with many secrets: a grandfather who remained a mystery until long after his death.\"\n\nSammy in the Sky\n\nBy Barbara Walsh '81, illustrated by Jamie Wyeth\n\nCandlewick, 2011\n\n\"Sammy\" is about how, after Sammy the hound dog loses his life, his human family keeps his spirit alive by celebrating all the things he loved. Amazon.com describes it as “A deeply affecting tale of love, loss, and remembrance— told in clear-eyed prose by a top journalist and illustrated by a renowned American painter.”\n\nLie After Lie: The True Story of A Master of Deception, Betrayal, and Murder\n\nBy Lara Bricker '98\n\nBerkley, 2010\n\nWhen the Game Was Ours\n\nBy Jackie MacMullan '82 with Earvin Magic Johnson and Larry Bird\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009\n\nJackie MacMullan's When the Game Was Ours with Earvin Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, was a New York Times best seller. Jackie is an ESPN analyst and a former columnist for the Boston Globe. Jackie covered the NBA for Sports Illustrated from 1995-2000 and has served as a correspondent for a wide variety of cable television networks including CMNSI, NESN, and WHDH-TV. She is also the author of Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching the Game I Lovewith Larry Bird and Geno: In Pursuit of Perfection with Geno Auriemma.\n\nSing Me Back Home: Love, Death and Country Music\n\nBy Dana Jennings '80\n\nFaber & Faber, 2008\n\n\"If you truly want to understand the whole United States of America in the twentieth century, you need to understand country music and the working people who lived their lives by it.\" So writes Jennings, an editor at The New York Times, in a book that’s part music history, part memoir of growing up poor in rural New Hampshire. The St. Petersburg Times called Sing Me Back Home \"one of the best things written about American music in the past two decades.\" Jennings takes themes of specific songs from what he considers country’s golden age, 1950-1970, and connects them with the characters and events in his own family.\n\nPublisher's site\n\nMajor: A Black Athlete, a White Era, and the Fight to Be the World's Fastest Human Being\n\nBy Todd Balf '83\n\nCrown, 2008\n\nThis story of race and racing centers on Marshall “Major” Taylor, one of the nation’s first black superstars. An athlete, poet and celebrity, Taylor lived a century ago, when the scars of the Civil War were still fresh and when cycling briefly replaced horse racing as the nation’s favorite sport Much of the book centers on Taylor's his rivalry with a white man, Floyd McFarland, to be the fastest bicyclist in the world. Reviewers have called the book \"literary sportswriting at its finest\" and \"perhaps the greatest American underdog story every told.\"\n\nTodd's previous books: The Darkest Jungle: The True Story of the Darien Expedition and America's Ill-Fated Race to Connect the Seas; The Last River: The Tragic Race for Shangri-La; The Story of Manny Being Manny, A children's book about Manny Ramirez, illustrated by Todd's father, artist Oliver Balf.\n\nA Ball, a Dog, and a Monkey: 1957 -- The Space Race Begins\n\nBy Michael D'Antonio '81\n\nSimon & Schuster, 2007\n\nWhen the Soviet Union launched the first orbital satellite, Sputnik I, in 1957, Americans panicked, then went space-crazy. A Ball, a Dog, and a Monkey tells the story of this country's early efforts to succeed in space: a time of exploding rockets, Florida boomtowns, competitive craziness and a wealth of UFO sightings. Booklist says, \"Besides narrating countdowns, missile failures, and nuclear explosions, D'Antonio evokes the boomtown atmosphere of Cape Canaveral through two young reporters, Jay Barbree and Wickham Stivers, who cut their teeth on the space-age story. An entertaining writer, D'Antonio delivers the technological heroics on which spaceflight fans are keen.\"\n\nSome of Michael's previous books: Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams; The State Boys Rebellion (2005)\n\nWe Went to War: New Hampshire Remembers\n\nBy Meg Heckman '01 and Mike Pride\n\nMonitor Publishing Company, 2008\n\nIn We Went to War, men and women from New Hampshire remember how World War II transformed—and often threatened—their lives. More than six decades later, they tell their own stories in words that are often poignant, sometimes tragic, and always human. In 2007, Meg Heckman '01 and Mike Pride of the Concord Monitor set out to find members of the World War II generation still living in New Hampshire sixty-two years after the war ended. We Went to War compiles the stories the two writers collected and adds several chapters. Although some of the women and men interviewed for We Went to Warrecall the gung-ho spirit of the time, they do not candy-coat their experiences. The war was about death and mutilation. This generation’s “job,” as its members saw it, was to do their part and come safely home. And one other thing: to remember, no matter how much they wanted to forget.\n\nThe New England League: A Baseball History 1885 - 1949\n\nBy Charlie Bevis ’75\n\nMcFarland & Co., 2007\n\nAuthor Charlie Bevis, a member of the Society for American Baseball Research, delves into the history of the New England League during the pivotal early years of minor league baseball. Chapters explore baseball’s ties to the regional economy and the textile industry, as well as the groundbreaking first examples of playoffs, night baseball and integration. Charlie has written for numerous baseball publications and is the author of two previous books, Sunday Baseball (2003) and Mickey Cochrane (1998).\n\nBackcast: Fatherhood, Fly Fishing and a River Journey Through the Heart of Alaska\n\nBy Lou Ureneck ’72\n\nSt. Martin’s Press, 2007\n\nWhen Lou Ureneck was 49 and his son Adam was 18, they took off together for a 110-mile Alaskan river trip. “My life was in a ditch,” writes Ureneck, who directs the journalism program at Boston University. “I was broke from lawyers, therapists and alimony payments and fearful that my son’s anger was hardening into life-long permanence. I wanted to pull him back into my life.” From the mountains to the Bering Sea, the two confronted bears, nasty weather, violent currents and their own differences. The memoir has been praised by a host of prominent writers, including Bill McKibben, who calls it “one of the finest meditations on fathers and sons that I've ever read.” The book won a 2007 National Outdoor Book Award.\n\nTwilight\n\nBy Brendan Dubois ’82\n\nSt. Martin’s Minotaur, 2007\n\nPublisher’s Weekly calls Twilight, the 11th mystery by DuBois, a “quietly devastating cautionary tale” about the future of the war on terror. Young Canadian journalist Samuel Simpson joins a team of UN war-crimes investigators working in upstate New York after a major terrorist attack against the United States. Danger surrounds them. Worse, Samuel begins to suspect there is a traitor on his team, someone who is working not only to conceal important evidence but to betray and kill them all.\n\nNot by a Long Shot: A Season at a Hard-Luck Horse Track\n\nBy T.D. Thornton '90\n\nPublic Affairs/Perseus Book Group, 2007\n\nThe publisher calls this book \"a gritty, passionate behind-the-scenes portrait of a year in the life of thoroughbred racing's working class, by a racetrack insider.\" The track is Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts, a.k.a. Sufferin' Downs, \"where grizzled thoroughbreds come to end their careers, hopeful young jockeys aspire against daunting odds to begin them, and diehard fans cheer, curse and gamble on the entire fascinating spectacle.\" The insider is Tim Thornton, who has both covered the track as a reporter and worked there as media director. Publisher's Weekly says Tim \"possesses a deep sympathy for and understanding of the dynamics and contradictions that sustain this threatened world.\" Tim says he aimed for a “caustically honest” chronicle showing how minimum-wage stablehands and hard-luck horses do the work that allows the upper echelon to bask in the spotlight.\n\nGeno: In Pursuit of Perfection\n\nBy Geno Auriemma with Jackie MacMullan '82\n\nWarner Books, 2006\n\nJackie, a Boston Globe sports columnist, ghostwrites the life story of the famously ferocious UConn women's basketball coach whose teams won five national championships and broke records with a 70-game winning streak.\n\nFrom the New York Times review of Geno: \"Most people would take pride in such accomplishments, but not Auriemma. He remains fearful, haunted. His only certainty is that it will all come crashing down around him. It's little wonder his players feel so protective toward him. Clearly, his outsider's insecurities -- as an immigrant, a poor kid, a man in a woman's game -- go a long way toward explaining his success. They also explain much of the charm of this book.\"\n\nProvincetown Follies, Bangkok Blues\n\nBy Randall Peffer '73\n\nBleak House Books, 2006\n\nFrom the Publishers Weekly review: \"Peffer explores sexual ambiguity in this offbeat legal procedural/whodunit. Callow public defender Michael DeCastro undergoes a baptism of fire with his first murder case: the defendant, Tuki Aparecio, is a Provincetown drag queen from Thailand (via Vietnam) accused of killing her lover, Alby Costelano, before setting a fire to cover her traces. Despite himself -- and his imminent wedding to an increasingly annoyed fiancée -- DeCastro finds his feelings toward his client evolving into romantic ones, which lands him in some compromising positions. The narrative alternates between Michael's sexually confused point-of-view and Tuki's flashbacks to her dark past in Bangkok and to the events leading up to the crime.\"\n\nSanta Claws, The Christmas Crab\n\nBy Priscilla Cummings '73\n\nTidewater Publishers, 2006\n\nBeneath Chesapeake Bay, Spud, a feisty young blue crab, hates to nap. Waking his underwater friends, Spud launches a rollicking Christmas Eve party that is interrupted by an unexpected traveler in need of Spud’s help. This is the latest of a dozen children's picture books by Priscilla Cummings, who has also written five young adult novels.\n\nThe Prison Angel: Mother Antonia's Journey from Beverly Hills to a Life of Service in a Mexican Jail\n\nBy Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan '81\n\nPenguin Press, 2005\n\nAfter a wealthy childhood in Beverly Hills, two failed marriages and much spiritual searching, Mary Clarke put on a homemade habit and headed to the most notorious prison in Tijuana, Mexico, where she has lived and worked since 1977. From Publishers Weekly: \"Jordan and Sullivan, who report from Mexico for the Washington Post, paint a portrait of this remarkable woman with a light touch, rarely digressing into lyricism or political backstories.\"\n\nThings Worth Fighting For\n\nBy Michael Kelly ’79\n\nIntroduction by Ted Koppel\n\nPenguin. Paperback, 2005; hardcover, 2004\n\nPublisher’s synopsis: Until 2003, when he died at age 46 while covering the war in Iraq, Michael Kelly was widely regarded as one of the pre-eminent journalists of his generation. This collection of his most memorable stories and columns — drawn from the Washington Post, New York Times, New Republic, and other publications — puts on full display the dazzling panoply of his gifts: for physical description and scene setting; for telling detail, brilliant simile, and satirical insight; for prose that is at once mathematically precise and lyrical. From his searing portraits of political figures to his stunning wartime dispatches from the front lines, Things Worth Fighting For represents the work of a journalist who time and again demonstrated a talent for penetrating to the heart of the matter — for getting the story other writers missed and telling it with a verve few writers could match.\n\nMike’s previous book: Martyrs’ Day: Chronicle of a Small War\n\nManhattan on the Rocks\n\nBy Janice Harayda '70\n\nSourcebooks Landmark, 2004\n\nFrom Booklist: Laura Smart, 25, can't wait to start her exciting new job in New York at the magazine Cassandra, run by sleek, sophisticated talk-show host Cassandra Lovelace. Laura can't get out of Cleveland fast enough.
