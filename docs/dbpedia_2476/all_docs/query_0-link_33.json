        "text": "CAS offers a wealth of immersive programs spanning biological science, physical and environmental science, data science, and mathematics. These areas incorporate the extraction of data to examine the fundamentals of how things work, exist, and interact within both the known and theoretical universe, at all scales – from the astronomical to the nano.\n\nStarting your first year, your professors will encourage you to join their research teams, where you can make real contributions not only in the lab but also at major conferences and in scholarly journals. These experiences will give you a strong advantage for professional or graduate school acceptance as well as rewarding careers in both the private and public sectors.\n\nBut your opportunities don’t stop there. You will find plenty of practical, career-focused experiences in such diverse offerings as our pre-healthcare preceptorships, summer geological field camps, the annual spring DataFest, and numerous internships, scholarships, and study abroad programs.\n\nThe wide variety of social science programs at CAS will plunge you into the roots of human nature and society. Our students are interested in exploring individual interpersonal interactions, analyzing the behaviors of social sub-groups, and understanding larger cultural and societal norms.\n\nFor example, Speech Pathology and Audiology majors study communication disorders, language development, and hearing. Psychology majors focus on human behavior, brain development, thought, and feelings. And Political Science majors examine issues of local and national governance, diplomacy and global politics, and social and political change.\n\nOur experiential learning opportunities include research, study away/abroad, internships, and scholarships. From the “inside the beltway” internship experiences at Inside Washington, to the guidance and networking resources provided by the Sue J. Henry Center for Pre-Law Education, to the on-the-ground, real-world impact of the Social Justice Internship Program, social science majors find numerous pathways to exciting careers.\n\nHumanities students in CAS delve into a vast range of fields devoted to the examination of the vibrancy of the human experience, how it is expressed, and the ways in which the intricacies of human values have shaped the world around us.\n\nWhether you’re tackling a world language, analyzing the origin of ancient texts, understanding how people consume various media, exploring the perspectives of global cultures, or even designing your own course of study, the humanities will guide you along a promising career path and sense of purpose. They also pair well with majors in business, science and technology, healthcare, and much more.\n\nEngage in research with top-notch faculty and participate in numerous resources and events with the Miami University Humanities Center. Beyond our wide variety of study abroad opportunities, you’ll discover our popular “Inside” career-focused internships in Hollywood, Washington, New York, London, and Chicago, all of which provide the chance to network with successful Miami alumni."
