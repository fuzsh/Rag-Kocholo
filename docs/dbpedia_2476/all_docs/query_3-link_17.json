        "text": "Retired University of the Pacific drama professor DeMarcus Brown, who inspired hundreds of former students to careers in the theater, died Friday morning in Stockton two months shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nBrown founded then-College of the Pacific's Fallon House Theater summer program at Columbia State Park for the 1949 state centennial. It became an annual resident summer-theater program in 1950.\n\nJudy Caruso-Williamson, a former student of Brown's who now teaches drama at Stagg High School, described the trim, white-haired professor -- always known as Marc -- as \"dapper and pristine\" from his cream-colored slacks and saddle shoes to his crisp, brass-buttoned blazer and signature silk ascot.\n\nFormer drama student Bobbie Wallinger said of Brown: \"He was bigger than life, and he always raised the bar.\"\n\nA former Fulbright scholar, painter and design artist, Brown earned numerous honors, including University of the Pacific's Order of Pacific and induction into Pacific's Pantheon of the Arts. He was a fellow of the elite American Theatre and received Stockton's Top Arts Recognition award in 1990.\n\nBorn in Knights Landing to a pioneer family, Brown earned his bachelor's degree from College of the Pacific in San Jose. He moved with the college to Stockton in 1924, where he headed the drama division of the speech department for 44 years, producing six to eight shows a year.\n\nBrown married Lucy Woodhouse in 1926, the first wedding on COP's Stockton campus. The Browns built a Spanish-style house on Knoles Way, where Brown lived until early this year. Lucy Brown died in 1992.\n\nIn a 1983 Record interview, Brown said he typecast whenever possible, adding, \"Why work against nature? I never held tryouts. I won't play God and turn a pipsqueek into Hamlet. The fat girl will never be Peter Pan.\"\n\n\"Marc trained in a transition time for American theater -- the movement toward realism in design and literature and away from posturing and declaiming,\" said Tom McKenzie, a former student who married the Browns' only child, Marcia Lou.\n\nThat style, compatible with techniques taught at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse, prepared many of Brown's students for further work at that famous proving ground and on Broadway.\n\nHis students who went on to theater careers include television stars Robert Culp and Ken Kercheval, movie and Broadway stars Darrin MacGavin, Barbara Baxley, Robert Nichols and Jo Van Fleet, Sesame Street's multiple Emmy Award-winning writer Nancy Sands, and designer Bill Strom, who worked for the Andrew Mellons and President John Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.\n\nRetired Delta Drama teacher Al Muller -- another Brown student -- attributed much of Brown's success to his attention to detail. He quoted Brown: \"Whatever show I'm working on is the most important show I've ever done.\"\n\nMcKenzie summarized Brown's creed: Pay your dues by painting, tearing tickets, building sets; master the basics; do the work; honor the tradition and make it better; never abuse your talent.\n\nMcKenzie said Brown mortgaged his house at least twice to bring a parade of famous performers to Stockton, making him what Stockton Arts Commission head Vince Perrin called \"Stockton's only impresario.\"\n\nBob Benedetti, dean of the College at UOP, said of Brown's legacy, \"He was able to inspire in several generations of students the kind of passion for the theater that continued through their lives. It was based on their thorough commitment to perfection.\"\n\nA memorial service will be held at — p.m. Friday, April 7 in Morris Chapel. The family has asked that any gifts be sent to St. John's Church Altar Guild Society, St. Mary's Interfaith Dining Room or the endowed DeMarcus Brown professorship at UOP.\n\n* To reach Record Dianne Runion, e-mailfeatures@recordnet.com"
