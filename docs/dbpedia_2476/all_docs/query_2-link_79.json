Cmdr. Alex Anderson, a recent graduate from the Naval Postgraduate School’s partnership with the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Temasek Defence Systems Institute (TDSI). Students in this challenging program spend six months at NUS taking courses in advanced topics such as cyber security, artificial intelligence and data analytics, on top of their NPS degree program, giving NPS-TDSI program graduates a firsthand perspective on current defense challenges in Singapore and the broader region, while complementing their technical specialization in their NPS fields of study. “Singapore is a critical Indo-Pacific partner,” said retired U.S. Army Col. Danial Pick, NPS Director of International Programs. “The decades-old educational relationship between NPS and TDSI is an important manifestation of our partnership. Hundreds of U.S. and Singaporean graduates of our unique dual degree program are serving in important national security positions in both countries.” For more information on this longtime partnership, check out the full story. • Learn more about international graduate programs at NPS: https://nps.edu/web/igpo US Navy | United States Marine Corps | Office of the Secretary of the Navy | U.S. Indo-Pacific Command | National University of Singapore | Temasek Defence Systems Institute | Naval Postgraduate School International Graduate Programs Office (IGPO) #partnerships #graduateschool\n\nFor the 14th year, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) co-hosted an annual U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, July 30-31 in New Delhi, in partnership with the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and with sponsorship from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. This engagement “supports U.S. objectives in the Indo-Pacific region by promoting cooperation and trust between the U.S. and Indian strategic communities,” said NPS Department of National Security Affairs professor S. Paul Kapur, NPS’ lead on this effort along with faculty associates Christopher Ketponglard and Diana Wueger. “In addition to helping the two countries to understand each other better, it has enabled joint work on areas that previously had been too sensitive even to discuss, such as nuclear safety and security.” Held at the Track 1.5 level, the closed-door engagements include senior representatives, active and retired, from the military, government, diplomatic service, academia, and journalism. Although the engagements are unofficial, Kapur said the discussions are highly-productive efforts in diplomacy. The dialogue “has yielded valuable insights into the two countries’ strategic outlooks, and given rise to new opportunities,” he added, including the release of a new book, “The Challenges of Nuclear Security: U.S. and Indian Perspectives.” The volume brings U.S. and Indian experts together to address critical issues in the safety and security of the nuclear enterprise. “The book addresses six issues of central concern to all nuclear states,” said Kapur, who served as editor on the project with Wueger and ORF’s Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan. “This book is the first of its kind and, given the sensitivity of its subject matter, would have been impossible to write even a few years ago.” • More about the NPS Department of National Security Affairs: https://nps.edu/web/nsa • Download the full open access publication, “The Challenges of Nuclear Security: U.S. and Indian Perspectives”: https://lnkd.in/gZeGPs5Y US Navy | United States Marine Corps | U.S. Indo-Pacific Command | U.S. Department of State | Defense Threat Reduction Agency | Observer Research Foundation | #partnerships\n\nEarlier this month, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) hosted its quarterly Joint Interagency Field Experimentation (JIFX) event at Camp Roberts, bringing together 167 participants from across the Department of Defense (DOD), industry, and academia. JIFX 24-4, which took place Aug. 5-9 at McMillan Airfield, was supported by NavalX and the Innovation & Modernization Office of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Education. The event provided a unique platform for 17 small businesses to showcase cutting-edge technologies, including unmanned aerial systems, situational awareness platforms, encryption methods, and advanced sensors. It also marked the end of an era with the farewell of Dirk Hale, the longtime field laboratory facilities manager who has been a pivotal part of NPS’ field experimentation programs since 2003. Grady Gatoloai will take over as the new facilities manager, continuing support for NPS researchers and visiting technologists in this vital role. JIFX embodies how NPS continues to be a hub for innovation, enabling rapid advancements in defense technology. The next JIFX, scheduled for Nov. 4-8, will focus on “Uncrewed Systems & Counter-Uncrewed Systems.” Submit your applications and project proposals now.

While there, the student team of Surface Warfare Officers (SWOs) talked about their studies and applied research projects with naval leaders, including the “SWO Boss,” Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, Commander Naval Surface Forces (CNSF), who delivered the keynote address and visited the NPS booth. “This trip is part of the Fleet Engagement Program at NPS, and it is a great way to enhance the learning experience of our students and faculty while connecting with the surface community leaders on opportunities for fleet-relevant research,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Jeremy Gray, who serves as the CNSF Surface Warfare Chair at NPS. “Faculty and students who attended had a chance to speak with not just leaders, but visit ships and training facilities on the waterfront, engaging with fleet Sailors to learn more about how NPS research can benefit the Navy and real-world operations,” he continued. “The visit provided a great venue for faculty to learn more about the at-sea experiences of their students and served as an opportunity to engage wardrooms on the great education opportunities available to them in Monterey.” • Learn about the Meyer Scholar program at NPS: https://lnkd.in/g-MF8Hzk US Navy | United States Marine Corps | U.S. Naval Surface Force | Surface Navy Association\n\n“Where Science Meets the Art of Warfare” in action at NPS! The Warfare Innovation Continuum (WIC) is a 12- to 18-month effort of interdisciplinary exploration and concept development on the future of warfare to address an emerging need. As a key component of NPS’ innovation operating concept, each WIC cycle – such as this year’s topic, “Integrated Naval Campaigning” – advances future naval warfighting concepts, the assessment of new technologies, and the development of new tactics, all while enhancing NPS students’ educational experiences and giving focus to many students’ applied research theses. Participants from the fleet, warfare centers and industry join the initial NPS-led workshop. “Our real product here is the at least 200 student officers who now think differently about how they would fight with the fleet and how they build the fleet,” says WIC lead and NPS professor of practice retired Navy Capt. Jeff Kline, fresh off his briefing of the 2023 WIC results to the Chief of Naval Operations and other senior Navy leaders at the CNO’s Futures Wargame. “The WIC’s real success is that we integrate it with NPS’ educational mission.” Read the full story about the WIC and check out the results of the 2023-24 campaign of analysis: https://lnkd.in/g9KXXayE And get ready for the kickoff of the 2024-25 WIC campaign, beginning with the WIC Workshop, which is scheduled for Sept. 23-26 and focused on “Non-Permissive Global Sea Control”: https://lnkd.in/gpbausfF • Learn more about Warfare Innovation Workshops at NPS: https://lnkd.in/dxzDJZ4V • About the Naval Warfare Studies Institute https://nps.edu/web/nwsi US Navy | United States Marine Corps | Office of the Secretary of the Navy | Office of the Chief of Naval Operations | Office of Naval Research | Naval Warfare Studies Institute at Naval Postgraduate School\n\n\"I'm here specifically today to strengthen and expand the relationship with this institution [NPS] and our office,” said Mr. Michael McGhee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) for Energy, “because of the importance of constant learning and constant expanding and constantly helping to push the innovation machine. And this institution is a significant part of that in the Department of the Navy.\" Hosted by the NPS Office of Research & Innovation, McGhee visited to meet with senior academic leaders, as well as NPS students and faculty, and participated in a Defense Energy Seminar (DES) lecture, “Enabling Success in Combat: NPS Role in an Integrated Approach to Energy Capability Development.” The DES lecture series and research help support the goals of the Department of the Navy’s “Climate Action 2030” strategy. In his capacity as DASN (Energy), McGhee provides policy and governance for Navy and Marine Corps programs and activities that enable resilience for weapon systems and shore installations.

Ten NPS students from the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Army recently returned from Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) and Trident Warrior 2024 exercises after conducting research on additive manufacturing technology applications at installations and aboard ships at sea. The school’s Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing and Research (CAMRE) and FLEETWERX enabled the effort, testing cutting-edge equipment to produce repair parts on-scene, increasing readiness. One significant accomplishment aboard USS Somerset (LPD 25) resulted in the repair of a reverse osmosis pump, critical to producing fresh water. “It was great to see how resourceful the entire team was on the Somerset in a time of need,” said Marine Corps Maj. Daniel Szurick, a master’s student at NPS. “That’s exactly the naval culture that will allow us to succeed in conflict.” “We are working to implement advanced metal manufacturing to better supplement traditional fabrication methods, repair fleet assets quicker, and assist in revitalizing the submarine industrial base to meet production goals,” added Lt. Cmdr. Zachary Vrtis, currently at NPS pursuing a doctorate in mechanical engineering. Conducting applied research in the operating environment is a hallmark of the NPS experience. “This allowed NPS students to see the relevance of their studies and research to real-world Navy challenges, which could greatly enhance learning outcomes here. At the same time, we are targeting the current gaps in the rapid deployment of these emerging technologies,” said Dr. Emre Gunduz, associate professor in NPS’ mechanical and aerospace engineering department and the technical director at CAMRE. • Read the full story, “Impact at RIMPAC” - https://lnkd.in/gqnUfFsy • Learn more about CAMRE at NPS - https://nps.edu/web/camre • NPS Additive Manufacturing Center - https://lnkd.in/gY4Jtw86 US Navy | United States Marine Corps | Office of the Secretary of the Navy | U.S. Naval Surface Force | Office of Naval Research | U.S. Pacific Fleet | RIMPAC | Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) | Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition | CAMRE #usnavy #RIMPAC #3dprinting #additivemanufacturing #innovations"
