        "text": "More than sixty professionals and graduate students attended our annual symposium with the DePaul Real Estate Center - a tradition that has been continuing for more than 15 years. This year's event, entitled Earth, Wind & Fire: Extreme Weather in Planning and Development, featured an expert panel comprised of Mary Ludgin, Sr. Managing Director - Head of Global Research, Heitman; Lisa Dickson, Associate Principal & Director for the Americas, ARUP; Josh Ellis, Vice President, Metropolitan Planning Council; and Michael Berkshire, Green Projects Administrator, City of Chicago.\n\nTRANSPORTATION ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION\n\nMembers of the Transportation Research Forum joined us for a lively roundtable discussion with Mark Walbrun, Senior Consultant – Rail & Transit, at Quandel Consulting, on cutting-edge technologies now in use or soon to be deployed on rail systems. Mark covered a variety of transportation technologies, including autonomous trains and battery-powered transit services. Erik Cempel moderated the event.\n\nANNUAL HOLIDAY RECEPTION CELEBRATION\n\nWe reflected on another successful year of research and events with new and old friends at our annual holiday reception on December 19. Professor Joe Schwieterman gave brief remarks to the group about the team's milestones in 2019, including moving into the new Chaddick space to completing the fourth installment of the Illinois Municipal Policy Journal. He also presented six first-year Sustainable Urban Design graduate students with awards for their 3-D model and neighborhood map submissions for the Chaddick Institute's inaugural Urban Design Award Program.\n\nSweta Amatya, Winner.
