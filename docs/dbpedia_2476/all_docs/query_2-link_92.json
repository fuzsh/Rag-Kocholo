Her primary goal is to promote progressive, climate-resilient communities that balance environmental, social and economic goals. She holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Environmental Studies and Sustainable Development from Brandies University (2007) as well as a Master of City and Regional Planning from the Rutgers University Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy (2014).\n\nSince 2008, Angela has served as The Virgin Islands’ Climate Change Officer, building the Territory’s climate change programme from scratch into a small-island best practice model with support from regional institutional partners. In 2008, she achieved Government approval of a multi-sector standing Climate Change Committee to support mainstreaming adaptation. In 2012, following broad-based consultation, she authored The Virgin Islands Climate Change Adaptation Policy. To serve as a sustainable financing mechanism for adaptation and mitigation, Angela also co-led development of The Virgin Islands Climate Change Trust Fund, a first of its kind in the Caribbean. This involved design of the Trust Fund architecture, assisting in drafting the Trust Fund Bill and defending it before the House of Assembly. These efforts resulted in the passage of The Virgin Islands Climate Change Trust Fund Act in 2015. Angela has since supported operationalization of the Trust Fund, including overseeing development of its Operational Manual.\n\nAngela has also designed and implemented creative climate change public education campaigns, conducted a vulnerability and capacity assessment of the tourism sector to climate change and managed implementation of local physical adaptation projects.

She also pioneered the Green Pledge Programme that encourages adoption of environmentally friendly practices across private sector and Government.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2021, Angela served as the Climate Change Coordinator for Saint Lucia’s Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, a diverse portfolio of 126 climate change adaptation projects worth USD $74 million, funded through the World Bank.

She also provided technical support to the Project’s innovative Climate Adaptation Financing Facility, administered by the Saint Lucia Development Bank. In that capacity, she led design and development of the Act to Adapt App which predicts Category 5 hurricane impact to homes and helps homeowners determine projects to build resilience.\n\nIn her private capacity, Angela serves as a climate change advocate. Following the devastation of Hurricane Irma in her country, within 3 months she wrote and published The Irma Diaries, a collection of survivor stories. With more than 35 speaking engagements around the world and a TEDx talk to date, she uses the book as a platform to educate about the impacts of stronger hurricanes, bridge personal connections to climate change and inspire global action. Angela has pledged 50% of profits from The Irma Diaries to survivors and the Climate Change Trust Fund.\n\nIn her spare time, Angela enjoys all outdoor activities, including her weekly Sunday swim! She looks forward to further contributions to climate change adaptation and sustainable development.\n\nARIELLE WORONOFF MPP ’09\n\nArielle Woronoff is the Director of the Office of Legislation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
