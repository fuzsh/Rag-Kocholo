        "text": "Dr. Kimberlee Kidwell - Class of 1981\n\nUIUC Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnerships & Initiatives, Scholar, Teacher, Plant Breeder\n\nDr. Kimberlee Kidwell graduated from Danville High School in 1981. She was one of seven valedictorians of her class and was a member of the DHS girls’ basketball and softball teams. After graduation, Kim went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) intending to become a sports broadcaster. An inspirational professor changed her course of study to plant science, and as a result she earned a B.S. in Genetics and Development (1985) and a B.S. in Agricultural Science (1986). She then went on to earn master’s (1989) and Ph.D. (1992) degrees in plant breeding and plant genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nFrom 1994 until 2016, Dr. Kidwell served as a faculty member and administrator at Washington State University (WSU). She is a nationally respected scholar and award-winning teacher. She is also an accomplished spring wheat breeder, developing more than twenty wheat varieties for Washington State farmers. Her research led to multiple patented discoveries and addressed basic questions involving gene discovery and genetic characterization of important traits for wheat improvement. Dr. Kidwell was the first female to be promoted to full professor in the Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences. From 2007 to 2016, she served as the associate dean of academic programs and the executive associate dean of the College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences. Dr. Kidwell also was the founding director of the Center for Transformational Learning and Leadership at WSU, which provides life-skill enhancement training for students, staff, faculty, and non-university participants.\n\nIn 2016, Dr. Kidwell was named the first female Dean and the inaugural Robert A. Easter Chair in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at UIUC. Her goals as dean were to improve student learning; drive sound, innovative research; and cultivate external partnerships to improve the lives and livelihoods of people in local communities and beyond. In 2021, Dr. Kidwell was named the first Associate Chancellor for Strategic Partnership and Initiatives for UIUC, a role she still holds today. Dr. Kidwell assists the Chancellor with strategic development of high-priority, high-impact, multi-stakeholder initiatives for the University. She provides leadership in pursuing resources and developing new and sustained partnerships with academic institutions, foundations, federal and state agencies, alumni, and the private sector to position UIUC to lead scientific discoveries and innovations that will inspire and empower tomorrow’s sustainable food, agriculture, nutrition, and rural health systems.\n\nWhile having a highly awarded and impressive resume, her accomplishments are only surpassed by her kindness and commitment to others. Her friends and colleagues are often impressed with her ability to relate to everyone, saying that she has the rare talent of making every person she meets feel mattered and seen.\n\nDr. Kidwell said the most important thing she learned while at DHS was to “to dare to dream and that I could do extraordinary things.”\n\nLt. Colonel Dennis B. Fay - Class of 1969\n\nFormer Air Force One Presidential Advance Agent, Retired United States Air Force Pilot, Pilot Instructor\n\nDennis B. Fay was a 1969 graduate of Danville High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science Degree from the United States Air Force Academy and later a master’s degree from the University of Texas A&M Commerce.\n\nCaptain Fay began his military career at Undergraduate Pilot Training. He was given the Commander's Superior Flying Performance Award for excellence in airmanship. He went on to fly as a KC·l35A Tanker pilot where he twice received the highest recognition award as a Distinguish Graduate in flight qualification training.\n\nHe flew many sorties in support of global Tanker Task Force operations and numerous Higher Headquarters operational missions. Captain Fay was handpicked to become an Aircraft Commander for a newly formed elite KC-l0A squadron in 1982.\n\nHe made strides to achieve flight status as an Instructor pilot and shortly thereafter moved on to become an Evaluator pilot. Captain Fay was asked to become Chief of KC·l0 Operations for the Director of Operations Training Division at 15th Air Force. He served as a member of the Support Battle Staff and coordinated and assisted in directing all KC·l0 Operations within the entire Pacific Operations. More significant accomplishments included the operational planning for Tanker air Refueling support for the Bl·B bomber's first world record flight and aiding the establishment of the initial integration of the KC· 10 into the SR·71 Blackbird's air refueling support operations. His later years were spent at the Command staff level, where he served at Headquarters Strategic Air Command and Air Mobility Command (AMC). Captain Fay wrote and authored several military policies and procedures throughout his career. He wrote the initial design structure for SAC's instructional systems development for the KC·135A's first Inertial Navigation System. Due to his knowledge and experience of understanding both airlift and air refueling operations, he was a key instrument in the rewrite of the Strategic Air Command/Military Airlift Command joint operating policies. Captain Fay also wrote several revisions to the KC-10 aircraft Cold Weather procedures still used by aircrews to date. He worked to design and develop KC·IO instructional courseware for training scenarios for Air Force aircrews.\n\nHe volunteered to organize and fly Air Force Academy cadet orientation KC-135 flights. He also stepped up and participated in Operation Air Force, a KC-10 summer orientation program for cadets. As a Command Staff officer, he volunteered his time to teach Quality Training at the Command level. On one special occasion during the holidays, he flew \"Operation Santa Claus\" for underprivileged children.\n\nEven with all of Lt Colonel Fay's achievements throughout his illustrious military career, none were more rewarding or satisfying than his selection by the Office of the USAF Vice Chief of Staff, as an Air Force One Presidential Advance Agent from 1988 to 1994. Captain Fay worked and coordinated directly with the Air Force One and Air Force Two Pilots, the White House Military Office, the US Secret Service, the White House Communication Agency and the Presidential and Vice Presidential Advance Staff. The culmination of his efforts was recognized in 1991 as he was nominated by the USAF Vice Chief of Staff Office for Airlift Management, the White House Military Office, and the Air Force One Crew. He was selected by the Air Force One Pilot as the Presidential Advance Agent of the Year 1990-1991.\n\nShortly after \"retirement\", he initially found himself working as a Courseware Writer and Developer and later a KC-10 Simulator Pilot Instructor for major aircraft corporations. He continued to teach and pass on his life lessons to the younger pilots for over 17 more years. He taught anywhere from recurring training to basic qualification courses and even instructor pilot certifications. He has always had a passion for being a pilot's pilot.\n\nDoug Barnette - Class of 1988\n\nSports Marketing and Management, Businessman, Philanthropist\n\nDoug attended Danville High School from 1984 to 1987. A transfer led his family out of Danville his senior year, but it wasn't long before he returned to his roots. In his professional career, Doug has been invited to the White House and has celebrated in Victory Lane at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Doug has quickly risen to the top of the sports management business. Doug’s successful career in sports management has primarily come in motorsports with NASCAR and lndyCar programs.\n\nSince 1996, he has taken his one-man management and marketing company from a client list that started with former Carolina Panther, Mike Minter, to a client list of NFL players, basketball coaches, race car drivers, and Fortune 500 companies. Prior to his leap into the world of sports marketing and management, Doug spent his entire life around basketball, including a professional career that included a tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing for the opposing team, the Washington Generals. He also served as a paratrooper in the United States Army following high school, serving in Central America and Operation Desert Storm as an airborne medic.\n\nBecause of his business success, Doug turned to active philanthropy to give back to Danville. Doug serves on the board of Crime Stoppers, is a regular supporter of Danville area youth sports programs, Danville High School Athletics, Danville Police Department K-9 Officer Program, and Rape Crisis Center to name a few.\n\nDoug is an example for future students to see that when you dream big dreams, you can accomplish big things. Doug enjoys running marathons and ultramarathons, often traveling around the world to compete in these events. When not running or working, Doug loves spending time with his wife Teresa, and their children JD, DJ, and Lauren.\n\nMike Small - Class of 1984\n\nProfessional Golfer, University of Illinois Golf Coach\n\nMike has distinguished himself as a player, coach, and leader in the golf industry. Mike was a member of the 1981 Danville High School state championship golf team and went on to the University of Illinois to continue his golf career, where he was a member of the 1988 Big Ten Championship team. That year, he finished 2nd individually in the Big 10. Mike graduated from the University of Illinois in 1988. He went on to a successful career in professional golf, including five years on the PGA Tour, then returned to the University of Illinois to coach the Fighting Illini in 2000.\n\nMike Small continues to compete on a limited basis in PGA tour events. Small was inducted into the Illinois Golf Hall of Fame in October 2013. Considered by many to be the greatest golfer the state of Illinois has ever produced, Small became the youngest man to ever be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. In the summers of 2007 and 2011, he was the low club professional at the PGA Championships and shared the award stand with its champions (Tiger Woods and Keegan Bradley). Mike Small has brought national recognition to the Illinois golf program in his 19 years at the helm of the program. The 2015 Dave Williams National Coach of the Year has guided the Illini to Big Ten Championship titles in 10 of the last 11 seasons and coached two NCAA individual champions in that span. Under Small’s direction, the Illini program has seen consistent success as his teams have not only continued to achieve greatness at the conference level, but on the national level as well. His teams have advanced to the NCAA Championship in each of the last 12 seasons and in 14 of Small’s 19 seasons. The Illini have won five NCAA Regional titles. Not only that, but the Orange and Blue have finished among the top five teams in the nation in five of the last seven seasons, highlighted by an NCAA Runner-Up finish in 2013.\n\nSmall was again recognized for his coaching success in 2016 as he was inducted into the Golf Coaches Association of America Hall of Fame. Small has been named Big Ten Coach of the Year, a conference record 11 times in his career and has also been named Midwest Regional Coach of the Year 9 times. Small has continued his professional career while coaching, most recently making his debut on the PGA TOUR Champions. Since 2000, he is a three-time PGA of America National Champion, a three-time PGA Professional National Player of the Year, a 12- time Illinois Professional Golf Champion, four-time Illinois Open Champion and has participated in 13 major championships. Small has appeared in several PGA TOUR Champions events, earning three top 10 finishes. He was named the 2017 OMEGA Senior PGA Professional Player of the Year.\n\nIn addition to success on the course, Small’s players have also had academic success. His players have earned 53 Academic All-Big Ten honors. Small provides the Illini with the unique combination of a respected teacher/coach and a current playing professional wrapped up in one man that has lifted Illinois, a cold weather school, into a national contender.\n\nWhen not on the course, Mike enjoys time with his wife Ann and two sons, Will and Wyatt.\n\nRaymond G. Prata, D.V.M. - Class of 1961\n\nDiplomate, American College of Veterinary Surgeons\n\nDr. Raymond Prata was raised in Danville, Illinois and graduated from Danville High School in 1961. Following graduation from DePauw University in 1965, he attended the University of Illinois Veterinary School, graduating in 1969 with M.S. and D.V.M degrees.\n\nFollowing graduation, Prata completed a one-year internship and a three-year surgical residency at The Animal Medical Center (AMC) in New York City. During this period, he also served as a visiting professor of neurosurgery and orthopedics at Cornell Veterinary School for a four-month period. He was appointed to the surgical staff and soon thereafter headed up a neurosurgical and orthopedic service. He became a Board Certified Surgeon and Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS) in 1975. Soon after, he was made Chairman of the Residency Review Board of the ACVS, which establishes the qualifications of a candidate to sit for the board examination. From 1981-1984 he was Head of Surgery at the AMC. Dr. Prata then practiced in two large referral hospitals; Oradell Animal Hospital in New Jersey for 23 years, and Veterinary Emergency Referral Group in Brooklyn, New York for nine years. He has received awards, including Veterinarian of the Year in New York and New Jersey.\n\nDr. Prata’s career in neurology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery and orthopedics was nurtured through his training at human institutions, including New York University (NYU) and Hospital for Joint Diseases (HJD) made possible by an externship at these universities during a one-year sabbatical from the AMC. Consequently, he was granted a position of Adjunct Professor of Neurosurgery at NYU. He remained active in Grand Rounds and the operating theater at this institution for the remainder of his tenure at the AMC. As a result of this exposure, Dr. Prata made tremendous strides in revolutionizing diagnostic protocols, surgical techniques, surgical instrumentation and surgical procedures heretofore not performed or reported in veterinary literature. Noteworthy of the many advances was the identification of benign brain tumors in cats (meningiomas), which he successfully operated and reported in publications and lectures. Likewise, protocols for the surgical treatment of numerous spinal disorders including herniated discs, spinal tumors and spinal fractures were advanced, as well as the application of bone plating to repair fractured bones. Prata helped promote a new surgical technique developed by a colleague for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, by performing the surgical technique in workshops and lectures around the country. The procedure, Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA), is now recognized by most as the gold standard for repair of ACL tears in dogs.\n\nDr. Prata was a national and international lecturer in neurology, neurosurgery, and orthopedics and the author of over 40 publications. He was also chairman of the annual Neurosurgery Forum of the ACVS for five years. Dr. Prata has trained over 350 interns and more than 60 surgical residents in the course of his 47-year career as a veterinary surgeon.\n\nHe has been married for 43 years to Yvonne, is the proud father of Steven, Jessica and son-in-law Lukasz, and the doting grandfather of Stephanie Cora Cianciara. Now retired, he enjoys maintaining his property, traveling, fly fishing, riding his Harley and spending quality time with his family.\n\nMike Hulvey - Class of 1983\n\nChief Operating Officer for Neuhoff Communications\n\n“As you walk these hallways, know that anything is possible. You have an obligation to dream big, to see the future and make it so. If you took the time to read this, then keep working, don’t stop, and never give up. You’re from Danville High School, just look around, you can do anything!”\n\nMike Hulvey attended Liberty Grade School, North Ridge Middle School and graduated from Danville High School in 1983. During his time at Danville High School, Mike found his love and passion for broadcasting while a member of the DHS Radio Staff. Mike started his career in broadcasting at the age of 14 with a part time sports job at WITY while also producing a weekend program with the DHS Radio Staff on WDAN.\n\nAs the Chief Operating Officer for Neuhoff Communications, Mike has overseen 23 radio stations in Illinois and Indiana along with 3 network television stations in Idaho, plus a number of stand-alone digital products. Update: April 2024 Mike becomes President/CEO of the National Trade Association for the Radio Broadcast Industry.\n\nMike understood that the media, and especially radio, is best when focused on locally. He emphasized the radio station’s participation in special events, local sports, community leadership, and often led his team through hours of on-air announcing from marquee activities, constantly shining a spotlight on the local community.\n\nToday, he is known around the country as a high-energy, motivational, dedicated and passionate leader in the broadcast industry. Former CBS Radio COO, Scott Herman, says Hulvey is “One of the most positive people I’ve ever met. His love for radio is infectious, and every time I’m with him I leave feeling really good about the future of our business.”\n\nAlmost 25 years ago, in an effort to give students interested in radio opportunities he never had, Mike co-created the Sports Media Camp for Kids held at Danville Area Community College. For one week each summer, Mike gave campers, aged 8-18, the chance to learn how to broadcast sporting events, to be a public address announcer, a sports writer, or a television sports anchor. Recognized by national publications as one of the first of its kind, this program is now replicated around the country. Due to their start in this program, many area kids are now working in broadcasting or related industries.\n\nHe has promoted the community at every opportunity. He has served tirelessly at the local, state, national and international level. Mike has twice chaired the national radio convention, served as an officer of the Radio Advertising Bureau and president of the International Broadcasters Idea Bank.\n\nBuilding his life around believing in the good of his family, friends, and in serving his community. Mike’s impact is impossible to measure.\n\nMike has spent a lifetime encouraging those around him to “March Forth and Be Positive”, which also happens to be his birthday and blood type.\n\nMark Denman, Class of 1971\n\nEducator and Community Volunteer\n\nMark Denman retired as Superintendent of Danville Community Consolidated School District 118 on June 30, 2015, after more than 40 years of service with the city schools. A 1971 graduate of Danville High School, he is the son of the late Wayne and Marjorie Denman, both also career educators with District 118. As a student at DHS, Denman was an editor for the student newspaper, Maroon & White.\n\nEmployed as a seventh grade teacher at East Park Jr. High School in January, 1975, he taught there until 1983. As a teacher, he was involved in transforming the district’s junior high schools into middle schools. As a principal for 21 years, he served at all levels of the school district – Daniel School (1983-1987), East Park School (1987-1994), North Ridge Middle School (1994-2001), and Danville High School (2001-2004). With his staff at East Park, he was instrumental in landing an Urban Education Grant for East Park in 1990, effectively pioneering one of the first broad-based after-school programs that was a model for other state schools. At Danville High School, the graduation and attendance rates showed strong improvement during his tenure. He is a follower of the axiom of first asking, “What is best for students?” He has successfully implemented dozens of initiatives over four decades to better serve the needs of students and to better support staff. In 2004, he was promoted to Associate Superintendent of Schools to oversee instruction at all levels in the city's schools. Denman served as Superintendent of School District 118 from 2009-2015. Highlights of his tenure include:\n\n$38 million of construction and facility improvements at South View Middle School, North Ridge Middle School, and East Park School\n\nRestructuring of academic programs, assessments, and delivery of instruction\n\nAwarding of the $6 million School Improvement Grant to DHS to raise student achievement\n\nInstructional coaches at all levels\n\nImproved maintenance and updating of facilities\n\nStandardized technology in all classrooms\n\nDevelopment of and accountability for the school district’s strategic plan\n\nCompletion of the DHS athletic complex, Wayland-Young Field, on DHS’ north campus\n\nBeautifying and increasing the size of the DHS campus, including the purchase and razing of neighboring abandoned structures\n\nPreservation of District 118 history, including the authoring of the 150th anniversary school district history in 2012 and the historical displays at DHS, purchase and updating of the former Holy Family School into the establishment of the Kenneth D. Bailey Academy as the consolidated home of the district’s alternative programming\n\nIn tough financial times, successfully maintaining the District’s financial position while maintaining programming\n\nActive in the community, he is vice-president of the Crosspoint Human Services board, past president of the Rotary Club of Danville, member of the Presence Hospital community leadership board, member of the Vermilion Museum Society board, and past member of the boards of the Danville Boys and Girls Club, United Way of the Danville Area, Danville Public School Foundation, and Vermilion Advantage.\n\nMark Denman feels that his greatest accomplishment was simply serving others and supporting them to succeed in meeting their goals. For those considering a career in education, he emphasizes that a teacher needs to possess not only curricular knowledge, but a big heart for kids; “the successful teacher effectively supports student achievement not only through relevant, rigorous, and research-based instruction, but also through establishing a meaningful connection with the boys and girls.”\n\nOn his retirement, the school board changed the name of East Park School to Mark Denman School in honor of his service. In showing his appreciation for the students and staff of the District, Denman commissioned and presented as a gift the statuary grouping located on the west lawn of DHS which shares this message with students: “Young people of Danville and Tilton – In the spot you stand, thousands have stood before. By the footprints you leave, generations to come will follow. Go forward, and through your acts and deeds, make our community proud.”\n\nInducted November, 2015.\n\nJohn P. Meyer (1920-2013) Class of 1937\n\nElected Official, Lawyer, Judge, Community Leader\n\nJudge John P. Meyer was a lifelong resident of Danville. At DHS, Meyer was a member of the Wranglers Club, Dramatic Club, secretary of the Boys’ Athletic Association, Booster Club, and senior song committee. He participated in football, basketball, and track. He attended the University of Notre Dame, earning a bachelor of science degree in commerce. He later received a doctor of law degree from the Notre Dame Law School. During World War II, Judge Meyer served with the 14th Armored Division as an Artillery Forward Observer. He was awarded both the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for gallantry in action. He served as an adjutant general of the 14th Armored Division since his discharge. Judge Meyer practiced law in the counties of Vermilion, Sangamon, and Cook for more than 55 years. He practiced in the firm of Burke, Twomey, and Johnson. He started a partnership with Henry Wise and Thomas Graham. The firm later became Graham, Wise, Meyer, Young, Welsh, and Maton.\n\nJohn Meyer was elected to, and served in, the Illinois House of Representatives and the Senate. He introduced and passed legislation creating a public defender’s office, the Fair Employment Practices Act, and state funding for Illinois Community Colleges, including Danville Area Community College. He also served as chairman of the legislative commission on narcotic drugs. He served as the first assistant attorney general for the State of Illinois. Judge Meyer was also admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. In his retirement years, he was a member of the law firm of Dukes, Ryan, Meyer & Freed, Ltd., with his son, Christopher Meyer. He was elected and served as judge of the circuit court for the Fifth Judicial Circuit.\n\nJudge Meyer was active in the Danville community, serving with youth football, the Vermilion County Museum Society, United Way, Schlarman Foundation, the Danville Dans baseball team (as its first president), and the Christian Home for Youth, an organization that assisted in the rehabilitation of juveniles who came before the county juvenile court. He purchased, sold, and raced thoroughbred horses, several of whom were winners in races in Florida, Kentucky, and Illinois. In his retirement, he authored the book, Observations of an Elderly Gentleman.\n\nIn 1942, he married Barbara Martin. In 1969, he married Mertyce Erickson Fagot. He was the father of five children (John P. Jr., Marilyn Manfredi, Elizabeth Elam, Michael, Melinda Jankowski, and Christopher) and three step-children (Tamara Fagot Goetting, Marc Fagot, and Rob Fagot).\n\nInducted November, 2015\n\nCarl B. Fliermans, Ph. D. (Class of 1962)\n\nMicrobiologist\n\nCarl B. Fliermans attended Roselawn School and graduated from DHS in 1962. At DHS, he was a member of Maroon & White, the Dramatic Club, A Cappella Choir, and the golf team. As he grew up, he admits, “I always had bugs, worms, snakes, and a variety of biologs in my pockets. I was probably the classic case of the late bloomer, but along the way, a few people took the time to believe in me and give encouragement. Two people in my early years were my champions, my grandmothers and my scoutmaster, Albert Greene of Troop 19.” He earned his undergraduate degree in biology at Asbury College, his master’s degree in soil microbiology from the University of Kentucky, and his doctorate in microbiology from Indiana University in 1972. He worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health at the University of Minnesota from 1972-1974. He began his 30 year association with the Westinghouse Savannah River Company/Savannah River National Laboratory in 1974. From 1974-2004, he advanced from microbial ecologist to microbial ecologist advisory scientist, the position he held at retirement. He has served as an adjunct research professor in biology at the University of South Carolina (Aiken) since 1980 and in toxicology at Clemson since 1990. He was senior vice-president and chief scientist of Environment America from 1989-1990. Since 1978, he has been President/CEO of Ecological Microbes Unlimited of Augusta, GA, and also, since 2004, a partner and microbial ecologist.\n\nDr. Fliermans is a noted microbiologist. He has published over 100 scientific publications, filed numerous patents, and earned many awards in the field of environmental and microbial ecology. One of his main areas of expertise is in the ecology of the bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ Disease; he was the first to define the environmental habitats where the bacterium lives and was the first to isolate the bacterium from its natural environments. His seminal research paved the way for the understanding of the disease, the successful treatment of the facilities that harbor the bacterium, and the definition of guidelines for the safe treatment of water systems for the Cooling Tower Institute and the American Society for Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers. His basic work in this area has been distinguished by being responsible for promoting the awareness of the bacterium and of mechanisms for its survival, growth, dissemination, and removal. His work has been useful in the saving of many lives. He has served as an expert witness for numerous cases throughout the nation for both the defense and the plaintiffs. His career of three decades at the Savannah River National Laboratory has earned him numerous awards and his work has been funded for over $100 million by both private and public institutions. His research has taken him to over 47 nations with the basic research in the microbiology of landmine detection, designing probes in the search for extraterrestrial life for the Mars probe, defining the existence of life in extreme environments of high temperature and high radiation fields, and probing for the presence of microbiological life thousands of meters below the earth’s surface.\n\nDr. Fliermans has this advice for current DHS students: “Choose something that you love and devote yourself to it. Go as far as you can go in your education, because the higher one goes, the more autonomy and freedom one can achieve. Don’t restrict yourself to working 8 hours/day, because that will restrict what you can do and what you can be. Work hard and wherever you are, be all there. Enjoy life. You get only one and that purpose is to glorify God Who made you and enjoy Him now and forever.”\n\nJohn Stevenson, Jr. (Class of 1955)\n\nBusiness and Industry Leader and Innovator\n\nJohn Stevenson attended Washington Grade School and graduated from DHS in 1955.\n\nAt DHS, he earned nine athletic letters in baseball, basketball, and cross country and was a key player on eight teams that won district and state titles. Baseball team captain, an editor of Maroon & White, class officer, and honor student, he compiled a strong record at DHS before he continued his studies at the University of Illinois where he earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees and was a member of the varsity baseball and basketball teams. He was a member of the Naval Reserve from 1954 through 1963 and served on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Bennington and participated in the Korean War Conflict.\n\nA leader and innovator in business and industry, Stevenson rose to the position of Vice-President and Director of Marketing for AT&T Consumer Products after serving in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at Illinois Bell and AT&T from 1962 to 1985. He introduced AT&T into the retail marketing world, opening the first retail phone center in the Chicago area's Woodfield Mall, which was followed by the opening of 800 additional stores across the nation. He was selected as one of five officers to be in the presidential potential officer class. He served at AT&T until 1985 when he was asked by the President of the University of Illinois to head a new industrial program. Stevenson served from 1985 until 2007 as corporate officer of the National Center of Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the U of I. He worked to meet and exceed the Center’s mission to “Improve the Competitiveness of American Industry.” He developed the market plan for the program, obtained the approval of university administration and the director, and introduced and supported a comprehensive partnership program to teach corporations the value of supercomputing. He successfully marketed the program to over 20 corporations in 13 business sectors and managed the partnerships for 20 years. Each of the participating corporations succeeded in making major competitive breakthroughs that resulted, not only in increased revenues, but in significant improvements that have helped mankind. In 1996, Fortune magazine featured Stevenson’s accomplishments at the Center. He was recognized as improving the way American industry does research.\n\nIn 1988, Stevenson met then-U.S. Senator Al Gore at a press conference at the National Center of Supercomputing. Stevenson developed a relationship with Gore which led him to help get two major bills passed in Congress, the 1988 National High Performance Computer Act and the 1992 Information Infrastructure and Technology Act which, along with the Center’s introduction of MOSAIC software in 1993, contributed to the opening of the internet. Gore shared, “The magnitude of Mr. Stevenson’s contributions towards the passage of these bills was tremendous. The combination of high-level corporate experience and personal leadership style that he brought to the NCSA helped create the type of systemic impact that forever changed and improved the way both corporations and individuals process information.”\n\nUpon learning of his induction to the Wall of Fame, Stevenson stated,“This is an incredible honor. The teachers and coaches taught me the fundamentals that have proven to be the drivers in my accomplishments. I referred to the principles they taught me throughout my life and especially in the tough business challenges I faced. They proved to be right over and over. I am deeply indebted to DHS. In fact, I am trying to teach my children the same principles.”\n\nDr. John W. D. Kay - Class of 1956\n\nPioneering Researcher\n\nJohn Kay attended Lincoln Grade School and graduated from Danville High School in 1956. He played tennis for four years at DHS and was captain of the tennis team during his senior year. He also worked on the Maroon & White, serving as editorial page editor his senior year. He was active in Christian youth activities. He earned his B.S. in chemistry at the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1960 and completed his doctorate in biochemistry at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 1964. During his lengthy and distinguished career, he worked as a research/development immuno-biochemist developing and improving tests to diagnose infectious agents such as hepatitis B, rubella, Group A Strep, and N. gonorrhea. His most famous pioneering work came in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The first cases of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in the United States were diagnosed in 1981. In 1984, HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS.\n\nWithin three months of receiving the viral materials, Dr. Kay’s team developed a test to identify the presence of the antibody to HIV in blood; this effort pushed all manufacturers to develop tests as soon as possible. This was vitally important as the nation struggled to protect the supply of blood that was available for transfusions. Within six months of introduction of the first test, he led a team that developed a test that was 300 times more sensitive than his original test, far more accurate than other tests on the market, and allowed the identification of HIV-positive patients 10-14 days earlier than the initial tests.\n\nA major challenge faced by Dr. Kay’s team was to develop tests that would be both accurate and simple to read and could be used on various body fluids. Ease of obtaining test results is important for rapid diagnosis and disease control. His group developed tests for HIV in which adding a liquid to a processed sample resulted in a color change as a final indicator that HIV infection was detected. This was an important breakthrough, particularly in third world countries where special equipment may not be available. Dr. Kay is a devout Christian and his faith has impacted his life, in and out of his profession. “When you take faith into the workplace, it’s amazing what will happen. Faith in the Living God will affect your work. You pray to understand what’s right and then the Lord enables a solution to the problems. ”Dr. Kay learned a valuable lesson at DHS that he has carried throughout his life. At his father’s insistence, he studied Latin. After a lackluster first semester he transferred to a different class. His new teacher had students conjugate verbs competitively; this exercise caught his imagination and inspired him to work much harder. “I accepted the challenge to learn well so I could do well. It’s the opposite of the culture of doing as little as you can. Putting in effort and activating your energy, not just showing up, makes the work more interesting. It’s so much better in the long run of life.”\n\nSteven F. Eckert - Class of 1970\n\nJournalist\n\nOver the past three decades, Steve Eckert has made life in our country safer by bringing issues to the public’s attention. His reports have earned TV journalism’s top honors. In addition to his Emmy awards, he has earned the Peabody, DuPont-Columbia, Edward R. Murrow, Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), RFK, Sigma Delta Chi, and National Headliner Awards.\n\nEckert’s stories have done much more than win awards. They’ve revealed wrong doing, exposed hidden dangers, and prompted changes in local, state, and federal laws. His hour long investigation of counterfeit medicine in America, entitled “Bitter Pills,” was judged the best TV investigative report on any network in 2006 by Investigative Reporters and Editors. It marked the fourth time that Eckert’s investigations have won the prestigious IRE Award. A national consumer group stated this Eckert investigative news production “…has done the nation a tremendous service.” That report earned him the 2007 Emmy Award for Investigative Reporting. Other investigations produced by Steve Eckert have changed lives, resulted in legislation, and earned national awards as well. Following are just a few examples of his work: Within days after Eckert’s hidden cameras captured outdated eggs being repacked and re-dated as if they were fresh, the USDA issued emergency rules. Within weeks, Congress passed new legislation and within months, the President signed a new law to protect public health (This production entitled “Shell Game” won several news awards).\n\nHe revealed fatal flaws in both the local 911 system and the Child Protection network, forcing major reorganizations in both systems (Edward R. Murrow & DuPont-Columbia Awards). Just four days after Eckert exposed “secret pardons” for convicted criminals, including child molesters, the Minnesota Legislature abolished the system (Murrow & Headliner Awards). Steve Eckert graduated from DHS in 1970. He attended Liberty Elementary School and North Ridge Junior High School. While a student at DHS, he was an editor for the Maroon & White and participated in the Radio Club. His first newscasts were at WDAN radio. He later became student news director at WPRB, the college radio station at Princeton University. He worked in radio for two years, then switched to television. He has produced national investigative stories and newsmaker interviews for NBC News and Dateline NBC since 1993. Looking back on his years at Danville High School, Eckert remembered, “My best memories… editing the Maroon & White…marching in the band at half-time of Viking football games…and helping revive the DHS debate team and nearly going to state finals in our second year. Looking back, two of my English teachers – John Sanders and John Watkins – stand out. They challenged us, expanded our horizons, and helped give us the confidence to keep exploring.”\n\nDwight Lucas - Class of 1968\n\nCommunity Advisor\n\nDwight Lucas has been a major force toward helping improve the lives of families in our community and the surrounding counties since the early 1970s.

The Community Action Agency is a major economic force with an annual budget of $9 million and over 110 full-time equivalent positions.\n\nDwight Lucas is one of a small number of Certified Community Action Professionals. This rigorous program, offered to executives of community action agencies, requires collection of letters of reference, a written thesis on management systems and program history, and completion of a 6-8 hour written test.\n\nNot content with merely changing lives locally, Lucas has taken a leadership role at the state and national levels. He is Board Chair of the Illinois Community Action Association that provides membership services including training, technical assistance and resource information to 36 community action agencies. He also sits on the board of the six state regional association.\n\nIn 2001, Dwight added further responsibilities to an already busy life when he became Executive Director of Laura Lee Fellowship House. During his tenure Laura Lee experienced a 50% increase in membership and 250% increase in building usage. He spearheaded and successfully completed a capital building campaign to raise over one-half million dollars to construct an annex to Laura Lee which will increase its program space by more than 50%.\n\nDwight was raised in public housing. As a child, he spent many happy hours at Laura Lee Fellowship House. After serving in the military, he worked hard to support his family and complete his education so he could offer a better life to his wife and children. \"Danville has been good to me and my family. I never would have dreamed, growing up on Junction Avenue and in Carver Park, that I could end up where I am. Public housing was a temporary waystation, not a lifestyle. I lived in a village where the whole village looked after you. I have been blessed and feel I have a responsibility to give back. You have to do the best you can.\"\n\nMatthew Woodring Stover - Class of 1980\n\nAuthor\n\nMatthew Woodring Stover is a successful author of science fiction/fantasy novels, seven of which have been published to date.

Although a member of the DHS Class of 1980, Stover took early graduation in August 1979. Two of his former teachers, Barbara Cullen and Joyce Brown (Alexander) encouraged him to pursue writing as a career. Matthew Stover says, \"Mrs. Brown was a lovely woman who taught an interesting class and took my writing seriously. She looked at what I produced in class and said I should consider pursuing that.\" He also cited DHS social studies teacher Bob Kay for igniting an interest in history that he still pursues today. Another source of inspiration was his mother, Barbara Stover, a rhetoric professor at DCC, who provided help, support and encouragement and was \"a major sculptor of my life.\" He regularly read her Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine which printed stories written by previously unpublished authors and helped him see that authors develop over time, they don't just \"spring full-grown from the brow of Zeus.\" He graduated from Drake University in 1983, where he earned a degree in theater.\n\nStover says, \"My primary intention (when writing a novel) is to write something that, on first reading people are going to stay up all night to finish, but it'll stay with them so that they'll read it again in six months to find more in it. What you get out of a novel depends on what you bring to it. If you read the same novel at age 17, 25 or 35, it's a different novel because you are different. I want my stories to be a collaboration between the story on the page and the reader's imagination. I want to be a catalyst for something in the reader's mind.\n\nMatthew Stover says his life was uniquely influenced by growing up in Danville because it provided \"an intersection of a rural and urban childhood.\" There were many industries in town, but also a working farm close to his home. \"I had the ability to walk out of my house and go someplace where all I could see was trees.\" He says that this varied background shows up in his writing \"all the time. You never really get away from anything, no matter where you go.\"\n\nKim Crockett - Class of 1975\n\nJournalist\n\nKim Crockett stands on the shoulders of giants.

Gilliland - Class of 1921\n\nScientist and Radio Tech Pioneer\n\nGilliland contributed significant research to the development of radio communication — ground to ground and ground to air. His study centered on gases ionized by ultraviolet rays and x-rays from the sun. He labored on two problems: (1) the skipping of signals from ionized layers to an area not designated and (2) the escape of signals through the atmosphere when they did not hit an ionized layer. He developed a continuous ionosphere record in 1932, and his recorder's initial photographs in 1933 were considered the world's first. These are now on permanent display at the National Bureau of Standards' Museum.
