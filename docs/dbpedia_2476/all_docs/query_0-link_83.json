        "text": "Identical twins Donald Kennedy ’73 and Ronald Kennedy ’73 have done almost everything together. They both majored in accounting. They both worked their way through college at Newberry’s A&P grocery store. They both joined the Air Force ROTC and served around the world. And they are both pioneers who helped change the face of education in South Carolina.\n\nThe brothers grew up in a segregated Fairfield County, still under the statutory grip of “Jim Crow.” Nearly every aspect of life was divided down racial lines and had been for as long as anyone could remember.\n\n“It was illegal for Donald and me to go to the public library, even though our father had defended the country [in World War II] and he and our mother paid taxes,” said Ronald.\n\nBoth avid readers, the twins were in high school before they were permitted to check out a book, and this only came after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe following year, Fairfield, along with numerous other Southern districts, introduced a “freedom of choice” policy, in an attempt to comply with federal law while avoiding full integration. Though Black families now had a choice of public schools, the onus of desegregation was placed on them, and few participated. In spite of the challenges, the Kennedys enrolled at the predominantly White Winnsboro High.\n\n“Our parents were really big on education, and they saw more opportunity with integration versus segregation,” said Donald. “Even as a kid I remember the excitement, the electricity that was in the air about the possibilities of change. Our parents were at the forefront of that.”\n\nBefore the brothers entered Winnsboro, however, they had to prepare to enter an entirely new educational environment. “There were like training programs for the African American kids there. That was 11 years after Brown v. Board of Education, and then the things that happened in Little Rock, Arkansas, with the African American girls going to school there and the challenges they faced,” he said.\n\n“There were obstacles that were put in front of African American students. Athletes were not allowed to play their first year after they transferred in. They didn’t have the same opportunities for leadership roles. The adults put up those roadblocks that we had to overcome over time,” said Donald.\n\n“There were some smart students that, after that first year, went back to one of the two all-Black high schools. You could feel some resentment from the administration, from some of the teachers, that they did not want us there, but we made the adjustment and finished our four years there,” said Ronald.\n\nWhen the brothers graduated high school in 1969, they enrolled at Newberry on the recommendation of their 11th-grade English teacher, Barbara Harmon ’56. For three years before they arrived, Nancy Lou Anderson Glasgow ’70 had been the lone Black student on campus. In the freshman class came the Kennedys and Carolyn Pitts-Glymph ’73.\n\n“Ronald and I represented 50% of the African American population,” joked Donald.\n\nThe Kennedys said while there were challenges, they didn’t experience much discrimination as day students. “Our role was to go to school, get an education, and we had to work in order to get through school. So I wouldn’t say we felt ostracized from a social standpoint,” he said.\n\nThey commuted bright and early each day, attended class, put in a shift at the A&P, and headed home that night to do it all over again. “From just a logistical standpoint, it was very, very convenient,” said Donald of attending college and working with his twin.\n\nTheir greatest sense of belonging at Newberry came from their participation in the Air Force ROTC program, which was established during their junior year by Maj. Fred Current. The brothers excelled in the fledgling unit, took the Professional Officer Course, and served as officers in the Arnold Air Society. Despite being on the path to commissions, ironically, they hadn’t initially planned to enter the military at all.\n\n“We never had any intent to go into the Air Force,” said Ronald. “It was during Vietnam. They had a draft lottery system back in those days, and our draft number was pulled, it was something like number nine. It was pretty low, which meant that as soon as we graduated and lost our student deferment, we would probably have been drafted into the Army, and neither one of us wanted any part of that.”\n\nThey were commissioned upon graduation and planned to take their accounting degrees to the Air Force Audit Agency. Though they hadn’t intended the Air Force to punch their ticket, they looked forward to venturing out into the world.\n\n“Growing up as African Americans in South Carolina, we had this vision of getting out of South Carolina,” said Donald. “He and I had a bet, it was a case of beer, and the winner was based on the farthest assignment away from South Carolina. He got assigned to San Antonio and I went down to Georgia, so he won that bet.”\n\nRonald and his fiancé were married two weeks after graduation and left for Texas the following day. The couple was able to travel the world together, with other duty stops in Guam, California, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and Naples, Italy. “My intent was to do my four-year commitment and leave, and a funny thing happened. I fell in love with the Air Force and stayed 27 and-a-half-years.”\n\nAfter six years with the agency, Ronald transferred to the Office of Special Investigations, or the “FBI of the Air Force,” as he called it. He retired in 2000 with the rank of colonel.\n\nDonald served 12 years in the Air Force, stationed from Georgia to Tokyo to Oklahoma City before transferring to the Airborne Warning and Control System, commonly known as AWACS, an airborne radar warning system designed to detect incoming aircraft, vehicles and projectiles at long ranges. He was based on a Boeing 707 and stayed “constantly deployed,” mostly in the Middle East during the First Gulf War, and then in Iceland as Cold War tensions rose.\n\nAfter leaving the military, Donald returned to accounting work. Most recently, he served as chief financial and administrative officer, then superintendent, and finally chief innovation officer, of the Charleston County School District. He went from being among the first of his peers to attend an integrated school to leading the second-largest school system in South Carolina. He retired from the district earlier this year.\n\nNow both retired, the brothers ended up returning to the Palmetto State for good, settling in the Lowcountry. They victoriously returned to campus with their wives in 2023 for their first Homecoming since graduation (right). Both have begun to reconnect with the College, particularly through the African American Alumni Chapter.\n\n“The liberal arts education and my degree in accounting were invaluable,” said Donald. “It allowed me to navigate through a lot of things in life, and I’ll always be grateful to the College.”\n\n“My experiences at Newberry, and particularly going into the Air Force ROTC program, set me on a trajectory that I never could have imagined,” said Ronald. “From a personal standpoint, I’m extremely proud of the school, the growth, the diversity. I’m proud to say I’m a Newberry alum.”\n\nA condensed version of this story appeared in the summer 2024 Dimensions, the magazine for alumni and friends of Newberry College.

He also created the acclaimed \"Eyes of a Generation\" website, which not only showcases his camera collection but has collected hundreds of stories and thousands of photographs and artifacts from the first century of television history.\n\nWhen Ellerbee recently bought a new home that didn't have as much room for his collection, he called his friend and fellow broadcast historian, Dr. Jodie Peeler, professor of communications at Newberry College, and offered to lend four cameras for display in the Langford Center. Peeler transported them from Ellerbee's home in Winder, Georgia, in February. With the help of a few students, Peeler reassembled the cameras and prepared them for display.\n\n\"It's a very good thing for all of us,\" Peeler said. \"Bobby really believes in the historical value of these cameras, and he's happy to have them in a place where up-and-coming generations can learn from them. For me, as a teacher, there's no better learning tool for our students than the real thing. And as a historian, for me it's a pure treat to have these rare treasures on display in our building.\"\n\nThe four cameras are an RCA TK-42, a large four-tube color camera built in the mid-1960s and used by many television stations when they switched to locally produced color programs; a Marconi Mark VII, a British-built camera from the late 1960s; a 1976 vintage Ikegami HK-312, the first all-electronic computer-controlled camera; and an RCA TK-47, introduced in 1978, which won an Emmy award for its innovative technology.\n\nThe Marconi, which currently wears CBS markings, originally belonged to Tele-Tape Productions in New York and was used in the production of several nationally televised shows, including the first two years of \"Sesame Street.\" The Ikegami, which Ellerbee outfitted with ABC markings, has an ABC property label on its box lens. The TK-47, wearing NBC markings, belonged to a station in Indianapolis, and the TK-42 was originally delivered to a Minnesota station in 1966. All the cameras are displayed on period-appropriate studio pedestals and are made to appear as they would have looked while in service.\n\nEllerbee's four cameras join Peeler's own TK-47, which belonged to KCET-TV in Los Angeles and was used in the production of Dr. Carl Sagan's 1980 PBS series \"Cosmos.\" Peeler has had the camera and its control room equipment on display in her office for the last several years.\n\nWhile none of the cameras on display at Newberry can make pictures any longer, they still tell stories that hold meaning for modern television.\n\n\"It's interesting to look at that huge TK-42 and realize the video you can capture on the average smartphone is so much better than anything that 260-pound camera could ever do,\" Peeler said. \"But you can't really appreciate how far we've come until you see that older technology for yourself. These four cameras really demonstrate the evolution of color television: from analog to digital, on through to the incredibly capable high-definition cameras we now use in our television studio.\"\n\nGuided tours of the collection may be arranged with Peeler at 803.321.5225 or Jodie.Peeler@newberry.edu.\n\nNEWBERRY — On a victoriously bright spring Saturday, Newberry College conferred a historic number of degrees upon the graduating class of 2024. The commencement exercises were held May 11 on Setzler Field.\n\nThe spring and summer class formed the largest in the College’s history, with 179 undergraduates and 17 graduate students, for a total of 196. The class also included the inaugural cohort for sport management & leadership, the College’s second master’s program, which launched in 2023. View the commencement program and event recording.\n\nCommencement Addresses\n\nSince 2014, the honor of the spring commencement addresses has been awarded to members of the graduating class, selected by fellow seniors, faculty and staff. This year’s addresses were delivered by Ishita Singh, a business administration major from New Delhi, India, and Vanessa Wilson, an elementary education major from Loganville, Georgia.\n\n“Yes, there were those 7:45 a.m.s that we did not want to attend, but we knew that if we didn’t, we would not be here today. Our professors were sometimes tough on us, but they know their stuff,” said Singh (right). “I hope you remember how Newberry College has given us lifelong memories and prepared us to be future leaders.”\n\n“I want you to realize that everything you’ve ever feared, you’ve survived,” said Wilson (left). “That is why you are here today: because you already know that you can overcome your fears. So, as we close this part of our journey, you have no reason to doubt yourselves. Be thankful for the fear. Be thankful for everything: from the struggles to the victories and everything in between.”\n\nSpecial Awards\n\nThe College’s most senior member of the faculty, Dr. Jesse Scott, professor of history, was presented with the title ‘professor emeritus of history’ on his retirement at the end of the academic year. He joined the faculty in fall 1985 as an adjunct instructor, joined the faculty full-time in 1986, was promoted to associate professor in 1991, and earned his full professorship in 2001. One of his most significant achievements has been the founding of the Summerland Honors Community in 1995.\n\n“You leave a legacy of passion, purpose and personal attention, and have enriched thousands of lives. Our earnest hope is that you may enjoy your well-earned retirement to the fullest,” said Dr. David Harpool, interim vice president for academic affairs.\n\nAs a special surprise, Scott (right) also received the Luceo Mea Luce Award, the highest honor the faculty can bestow, given to individuals whose lives of devotion, learning and service exemplify the motto, “by my light, I enlighten.”\n\n“His teaching, service, and scholarship — and his dedication to Newberry College and the local, state, national, and global communities we serve — stands as a powerful testament to the positive impact one person may make on countless lives,” said Dr. J. Tracy Power, associate professor of history and college archivist. “A modest estimate would be that he has taught, mentored, challenged, and encouraged more than 5,000 students since 1985. Dr. Scott, we honor and celebrate your lifelong devotion to Newberry College with the Luceo Mea Luce Award.”\n\nThe graduating class presents the Dr. L. Grady Cooper Awards to a faculty member and a senior who exemplify the loyalty and devotion to Newberry College that Cooper demonstrated during his tenure as a professor of religion and Greek. This year’s recipients were Dr. J. Tracy Power and Ishita Singh.\n\nThe Algernon Sydney Sullivan and Mary Mildred Sullivan Awards were established to honor one man and one woman of the graduating class who demonstrate outstanding character and service to others, traits valued by Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan. The awards were presented respectively to McGuire Raines, a biology major from Chapin, and Payton Cronen, a double-major in exercise science and sport management from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Dr. George B. Cromer Award, named for Newberry College’s fifth president, is presented by the faculty to the graduating senior who exemplifies academic excellence, leadership ability and personal integrity. This year, the honor was presented to Ja’kobe Bush, a social studies education major from Aiken.\n\nClass of 2024 Quick Facts\n\nThe spring and summer graduates represented 20 states and nine other countries — Canada, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Bahamas, Sweden, India, Panama and Zimbabwe. The most popular majors were business administration (33), sport management (19), exercise science (18), nursing (16) and criminal justice (14). This year also saw the largest nursing class since 2013, as well as the largest master’s cohort since the College’s graduate-level accreditation in 2021.\n\nNEWBERRY — Newberry College honored six outstanding alumni educators with induction into the prestigious Hall of Master Teachers. The event was held May 8 at the Center for Teacher Education.\n\nThe society’s awards recognize graduates of Newberry College for exemplary dedication, service and excellence in the field of education. Each year, honorees are selected for five awards, each recognizing a different area of distinction: new, veteran and retired classroom teachers, educators who works outside the classroom, and heroes for diversity and equity.\n\nNominees are evaluated on their professional activities, educational and community leadership, and influence on students and colleagues.\n\nGriffin Gunter ’13 received the Veteran Classroom Teacher Award. He teaches at Lexington County School District One’s College Center, which offers students the opportunity to earn an associate degree in high school. Gunter prepares freshmen and sophomores for dual-enrollment math courses. He works with the Gilbert High School wrestling program and makes a point of supporting other student-athletes in the off-season. He has also mentored Newberry College graduates in their first years in the teaching profession.\n\nDr. Terry L. Fellers ’69 received the William Dufford ’49 Retired Educator Award. Throughout his career, he taught math at Boiling Springs High School, served as a guidance counselor at Batesburg-Leesville High School, and taught night classes at Piedmont Technical College. After having retired from full-time teaching, Fellers now works in adult education in Newberry County. \"Terry Fellers is all about the students,” said his nominator. “He only wants to push them to their greatest potential. There is no better cheerleader to have on your side.”\n\nKaitlynne Goodman ’22 was honored with the New Classroom Teacher Award, which recognizes teachers in their first five years. She teaches English at Ridge Spring-Monetta Middle/High School and advises the Senior Beta Club and National English Honor Society. She has worked to make sure parents are informed and involved, and that her fellow teachers are appreciated. “Ms. Goodman goes above and beyond to make sure her students know she cares about them. She challenges her students to think outside of the box and her classroom is very student-centered and student-led,” said one nominator. “Her passion and commitment to her students never fails to impress me,” said another.\n\nDerrick Hines ’08 received the Educator Outside the Classroom Award. He mentors up-and-coming educators as director of the Teaching Fellows program at the University of South Carolina, and as a college coordinator for the teacher cadet program. His work takes him to high schools across South Carolina, where he inspires students to continue their education and even to pursue teaching as a vocation. He is a member of the Palmetto State Teachers Association and serves on numerous K-12 and college education advisory boards. He was a 2015 finalist for Dreher High School’s Teacher of the Year and a 2024 finalist for the University of South Carolina’s U101 Program Instructor of the Year. Hines also serves on the Newberry College Alumni Association’s Board of Managers.\n\nBrandarius Jones ’20 and Dr. Peggy Barnes Winder ’86 were co-recipients of the Nancy Lou Anderson Glasgow '70 Diversity & Equity Warrior in Education Award.\n\nJones teaches fifth grade at Killian Elementary School and works as a defensive coach for W.J. Keenan High School’s football program. He also serves as the campus site coordinator for Newberry College’s Call Me MISTER program, which works to address the nationwide shortage of male elementary school teachers from diverse backgrounds. He has also been involved in community service efforts in the Columbia area, including work with homeless individuals. In July 2023, he received the Neon Apple Award from the Columbia Fireflies.\n\nWinder has taught at Newberry College since 1990, when she became the college’s first Black full-time professor. In 2012, she assumed the role of director of diversity education and was instrumental in the creation of Dufford Diversity & Inclusion Week, which she spearheaded as committee chair for a decade. She also chaired the Multicultural Committee from 2013-22. She is a two-time SGA Professor of the Year, a 2011 recipient of the L. Grady Cooper Award, and a 2022 recipient of the Alumni Distinguished Service Award, among others. A skilled athlete and coach, in 1998, she became the first female inductee into the Newberry College Athletic Hall of Fame. In February, she was one of the first two women’s basketball alumnae to have their Newberry College jerseys retired.\n\nPictured: Dr. Peggy Barnes Winder ’86, Dr. Terry Fellers ’69, Kaitlynne Goodman ’22, Griffin Gunter ’13, and Brandarius Jones ’20.\n\nNEWBERRY — The City of Newberry honored a dozen Newberry College seniors Friday as part of an annual tradition that celebrates the impact of college students on the local community.

Six consecutive conference titles, and 10 Super Region championships. Attendance at the NCAA national tournament every year since 2006, and four national champions. There’s little doubt that the Wolves are forged for battle.\n\nThis season, the ranks have been bolstered by two retired and one currently serving member of the United States Armed Forces: Jacoby Benjamin, JP Gamez and John Parker. Each started wrestling as a teenager, joined the military, and, though they took different routes, found their way to Newberry.\n\n“These three in particular have brought so much to the program beyond what we even thought in the initial recruiting process,” said head wrestling coach Deral Brown ’13.\n\nBenjamin, a senior from Richmond Hill, Georgia, began his college career at North Iowa Area Community College, wrestling for a year before joining the United States Army in 2015 as a combat engineer. In that role, Benjamin said he and his team entered an area before the infantry, sweeping it for explosives. After four years, he became an aircraft mechanic, working on electrical components of Blackhawk, Chinook and Apache helicopters. While on a mission at Noncommissioned Officer Academy, Benjamin suffered pectoral muscle and shoulder labrum tears. He passed the course and obtained the rank of sergeant, but a nerve was damaged during the ensuing surgery, ending his military career.\n\nDespite this, Benjamin was able to return as a coach to the sport he loved. While attending Georgia Southern, he took his talents to Georgia’s Richmond Hill High, where, in an unexpected twist he would coach his soon-to-be Newberry teammate, Will Evans. Benjamin soon after applied to coach at Newberry. While there wasn’t an opening for a coach, there was a place on the mat with his name on it. With a degree already in progress and financial aid from the G.I. Bill, he transferred his remaining eligibility to the Wolves.\n\n“Coach [Bryant] Blanton ['11] was a big push towards me coming to wrestle,” he said. \"He stayed in contact with me, getting stuff in order. I came out to Super Regionals to watch them, get a feel for the team. I talked it over with my wife, and she was like, ‘hey, let’s do it.’”\n\nBenjamin hadn’t been on the mat in 10 years, but after getting back into the swing of things, he said he is better for it. “It’s helped mold me as a person, as an athlete, and as a man, just with resiliency, confidence and maturity. I love being here, working with the coaches and a great team. The biggest difference between our program and any of the programs I’ve been in is they really preach academics first, wrestling second. We do weekly progress reports, and I’ve never seen that before. The fact that we have the wrestling success we do have, and the academic success, is just a praise to the coaches and the dedication of the team.”\n\nIn his time with the Wolves, Benjamin posted a 19-7 record. He plans to graduate in May with a bachelor’s in exercise science and human performance, with the goal of becoming an athletic trainer and continuing to coach. He and his wife are also expecting their first child this summer.\n\n“Jacoby popped up later in the spring semester last year around this time,” said Brown. “He’s been such a breath of fresh air, the leadership he’s brought as an adult. He’s 29, going on 30, with a kid on the way, so just a different perspective than your traditional college student. That has really helped our team when it comes to the maturity it takes to win a championship, which is our goal at the end of the day.”\n\nGamez, a senior from Dade City, Florida, wrestled in middle and high school and joined the program at North Iowa Area Community for two years (where, coincidentally, Benjamin had been a few years before). He dislocated his elbow, and with his wrestling career set back a bit, he took a couple of years off from school, working various jobs. He joined the South Carolina Army National Guard in October 2020, graduated from bootcamp in July 2021, and enrolled at Newberry the following month. He attended One Station Unit Training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and now serves as a cavalry scout in addition to studying full-time.\n\n“We’re more of a stealth-operated kind of unit,” said Gamez. “Originally, U.S. cavalry scouts rode horses, and they were there to scout battlefields, locating enemy troops and using the terrain to their advantage. We do the same thing now except we’re mechanized. It’s cool.”\n\nOne of Gamez’s high school teammates came to wrestle at Newberry, and he “got the wheels turning for me,” he said. “It felt like home coming here. I wanted to come to a college with a good wrestling team. I never looked back after that.”\n\nDuring his time with the Wolves, Gamez has stepped up as a starter in the 141-pound division, and he represented Newberry at the NCAA Super Region tournament, held at Lander University on March 2.\n\nGamez plans to graduate in May with a degree in business administration. He plans to combine his love of business and the arts, as he works to complete his novel and produces short stop motion animation films.\n\n“JP, I can’t think of a bigger ‘team’ guy,” said Brown. “Any time the call was given to him, that we needed him to step up, he answered it, no questions asked. Perfect example was when Zach Harrington, our starting 141-pounder, he went down with a season-ending injury a month or two before regionals. But I called JP and said, ‘hey, man, we need you to step up, even though you’re undersized, and be the guy for the rest of the year. No complaints at all, did what was asked of him, answering the call for his teammates.”\n\nA native of Temecula, California, Parker attended high school in Florida and was a one-time state qualifier before he joined the United States Marine Corps after graduation.\n\n“I wanted to be physically challenged,” said Parker. “I wanted to serve my country and get a free college education while I was at it.”\n\nHe served four years of active duty as a Fire Support Man. “Basically I’d be telling the artillery, mortars, and if necessary, any aircraft where to shoot,” he said. “I went on a MEU [Marine Expeditionary Unit] so I was on ship for seven months just ready in case anything happened. We were all over the place: Hawaii, Guam, Thailand. We trained in Jordan and Kuwait.”\n\nAfter he concluded his four years in the Marines, Parker looked forward to returning to wrestling and earning a degree. “My high school coach knew Coach Cy [Wainwright]. I saw that this program had two national championships going here, so I knew that it was going to be a solid program where I’d be able to improve, and I definitely have.”\n\nIn March, Parker won the 197-pound division at Super Regionals. He was one of five wrestlers to represent Newberry at the national tournament in Wichita, Kansas. He was defeated in the second round, and in the consolation round, he defeated Limestone’s Jack Trautman for the third time in the season. His tournament run ended to Nebraska-Kearney’s No. 8 Jackson Kinsella.\n\nParker finished his junior season 31-9 and undefeated in South Atlantic Conference play, the best record on the team. Brown said he finished the season with 14 pins, which places him among the nation’s top 10, across all divisions. He was also named the Conference Carolinas Elite 23 Wrestler for his perfect 4.0 cumulative GPA, the best in the league.\n\nParker plans to graduate in spring 2026 with a degree in mathematics. He hopes to continue his education with a master’s in sport management, with the goal of eventually coaching wrestling at the collegiate level.\n\n“John Parker is a guy who leads by example. Not super vocal in the room, but he leads in his work ethic and the amount of work he puts in here,” said Brown. “John is in here every morning at 8 a.m. with Coach Blanton working on things that he needs to continue to improve on, and so much stuff that people don’t even see. This season was his first time as our starter and he ended up winning the region. It’s so awesome to have him.”\n\nSpeaking of all three, Brown said, “The biggest thing they bring is a disciplined lifestyle. I think in any sport it's important to have, but especially college wrestling, given the weight management piece and trying to do that on top of your school, on top of the regular training regimen that we have to maintain. They are assets to our program.”\n\nPhotos provided by Newberry College Athletics.\n\nNEWBERRY — The pipe organ in Newberry College’s Wiles Chapel has seen a lot — 57 years of commencements, convocations, weddings, funerals, concerts and much more. It has provided musical counsel and melodious enhancement in some of life’s grandest and most sacred moments.\n\nAfter decades of faithful service and with just about all its original parts, the instrument is beginning to show its age. To restore the organ to reliability and functionality, the College is requesting support from all who may have been moved by its majestic tones.\n\n“Music touches more than our ears. It is a part of our soul and very being,” said Campus Pastor David Coffman '97. “The right piece of music can invoke joy and heartfelt sadness. The organ is a vital part of the ongoing ministry to the Church, College and community and needs to be restored.”\n\nEquipped with 35 ranks and 1,994 pipes, the organ was built in 1967 by the Schantz Organ Company. The $60,000 purchase price (or about $556,000 in today’s dollars) was provided by Deems Haltiwanger (1897-1997), of Columbia, a faithful supporter of the Lutheran Church in South Carolina. Constructed simultaneously with the College’s Wiles Chapel, it would not be far off to say that the chapel itself was built around the organ.\n\n“Called the ‘King of Instruments,’ the pipe organ is a powerful instrument,” said Tony Roof '85, organist at Pisgah Lutheran Church in Lexington. “From the softest to fullest sounds, the organ can comfort us when we mourn, heighten our celebration when we rejoice, and help us lift our praises to the Lord.”\n\nThe grand instrument was designed for the space by longtime College organist and music professor Darr Wise (1929-2021), who would command its keys for the next three decades until his retirement. Today, however, due to a number of factors, the organ’s functionality has become limited. The College is raising $350,000 to not only restore playability, but also to outfit the instrument for many more decades of holy harmonies.\n\n“Some things have to be replaced. They don’t last forever, just like any other piece of machinery. It’s man-made,” said Dr. Jonathan Hall, College organist and coordinator of music education.\n\nHall said the biggest challenges to overcome stem from the organ’s console, the control center of the instrument where the organist sits. In short, in normal operation, the organist pulls stops, many of which activate ranks, or sets of pipes that share tonal characteristics and functions. These ranks belong to particular divisions of the organ, from the manuals (keyboards for the hands) or pedals (played with the feet). While the organ is turned on, air is pumped into the windchests. When a stop is pulled and a key on the corresponding division is depressed, a valve opens underneath the pipe to allow air to make contact with the pipe and produce sound.\n\nIn its present condition, the connection is not as stable between the console and the rest of the instrument, for various reasons. The windchests, which generate air for the organ’s sound, are wearing thin and need new leather. On the console, one of the three manuals does not produce sound at all. Due to aging among air-directing components, twenty-five of the organ’s 35 ranks are not complete.\n\n“If you think about each of these [ranks] being an orchestral instrument, right now we're missing 25 instruments of the 35 that we have,” said Hall. “When something goes wrong with the pipes, like we have a cipher or something where it would just continuously play, then it's common practice to remove that pipe temporarily. So, if you were to play a melody, you would be missing notes.”\n\nIn addition to restoring some elements of functionality, part of the renovation will include updates to allow the organ to meet present-day demands. This includes digitizing the console, which currently communicates with the rest of the organ via air dash driven components. Further, the organ’s memory system, which allows combinations of stops to be programmed to switch easily on demand, includes only six available presets.\n\n“Any service you play, this gives you six different options of presets. Organs today will have typically a minimum of 10 pages worth, typically about six to 10 memories, so we’re very limited if someone were to come play a recital. They would have to stop and program or pull the stops in time, which is very difficult and sometimes impossible to do, depending on the piece you’re working on,” said Hall.\n\nThe renovation would also include moving the console from the pit, in which it currently resides, to a mobile cart. This would create new space on the chapel’s stage, make the console more accessible to organists, and allow it to be moved depending on the occasion. With this refurbishment, the original ivory keys will be kept and built back into the console.\n\n“All organs get updated throughout the years. That’s not unusual. We’re not asking to build a brand new console or start from scratch or get all new pipes. It’s just making this current and where it’s playable,” said Hall.\n\nThe fundraising goal will include $300,000 for the necessary repairs and upgrades, with $50,000 for an endowment to help with future maintenance costs.\n\n“The Schantz pipe organ in Wiles Chapel has provided a majestic musical witness to our Lutheran heritage for the past 57 years,” said Dr. Huger Caughman '00, organist at the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Newberry. “The organ restoration project will ensure its continued splendor and glory as we continue to serve the church and posterity.”\n\nTo give, visit newberry.edu/give and enter “Wiles Chapel Organ” in the designation box, or make your check payable to Newberry College, 2100 College St., Newberry, SC 29108, with “Wiles Chapel Organ” on the memo line.

He guides and energizes an elite team that provides electricity to over 13,000 homes, schools, churches and businesses. He keeps watch over a complex 1,590-mile network of line with direct impacts on the daily lives of tens of thousands, itself part of a larger grid, powered by an industry evolving at the speed of light. In a business where a stray finger can take a life, steady hands are required on every end of the line. Throughout his career, Avery has stood at all of them.\n\nIn December, the 64-year-old utility executive crossed the stage at Newberry College’s Wiles Chapel to receive his Master of Science degree in organizational development & leadership. Avery says the degree wasn’t filling for a box on an application, but the fulfilling of a longtime personal and professional goal.\n\n“I had started my master’s a few years ago and never finished it. I wanted to finish it more for me than anything else, and I liked what I saw at Newberry,” he says. “Even though I can retire right now, there’s still a lot that I need to learn moving forward. Our industry is going through a lot of change right now. In looking at the organizational development part of the curriculum, and then looking at the leadership part, I’ll need both.\n\n“Plus, I wanted to do the master’s because I push my staff to continue their education, and if I’m gonna push them, I needed to continue and to get that done,” he adds.\n\nFor Avery, education is for life, and his graduate coursework has been a continuation of the training he began as a teenager, first in the South Carolina Army National Guard, then as a groundman for his local cooperative.\n\n“When I was 17, I joined the Guard, went through basic training, infantry school, whole nine yards,” he says. “I was in for four years, and I decided to go to Officer Candidate School, went overseas twice, and I retired after 21 years as a major. I had no intention of going to school. None whatsoever. But the Army did me a good turn because they straightened my head out. I realized real quick that I did not know everything, so I needed to go back to school.”\n\nAvery studied industrial electricity and electronics at Piedmont Tech, went to work for Laurens Electric, “started out as a groundman and worked my way up.” He soon made it to lineman, then crew leader, moved into engineering, and then to marketing, “of all things.” While climbing the ladder for Laurens, figuratively and literally, Avery worked toward a bachelor's degree at Limestone, which would allow him to be promoted in the National Guard. He started work on a master’s several different times, and then, in 2011, Newberry Electric’s top slot came open.\n\n“This job came up, I put in for it, and I was fortunate enough to get it,” he says.\n\nThirteen years into the job, Avery isn’t finished growing as a leader — a task he says is never really done, especially in an industry that is vital, dangerous, and ever-evolving. From preserving and growing reliable electricity generation sources, to maintaining local systems and load capacity, to keeping technology up-to-date, to battling the elements and ensuring crew safety, to leading a team and a community when it matters most, there’s no room for complacency.\n\n“It’s bigger than losing a sale, or losing a client, or something like that. Our folks literally can be killed on a daily basis in the jobs that they do,” he says. “When you get into a situation to where your work impacts people's lives, you’ve got to be able to handle that with empathy.”\n\nHe talks about the rolling blackouts of Christmas Eve 2022, when temperatures plummeted into the teens, as a recent test of leadership on all fronts.\n\n“The biggest thing is, I have to be up front. I have communications people, I have public relations people, but when a crisis happens, the leader of the organization needs to be the one out front with the plan,” he says. “I talked more to my staff than I probably did to some of my family members on Christmas Eve, until there was enough going online.\n\n“It can be stressful. I’ve been fussed at before because somebody’s had a high power bill. But if you really want to be cussed at, lose power during Christmas Eve when mama’s trying to cook dinner,” he says. “It's easy to lead when things are going well. True leaders come to the forefront when they're involved in a crisis.”\n\nAvery began Newberry’s ODL program in January 2023, and he says his coursework was beneficial and applicable from day one.\n\n“The [organizational development] part of it — navigating change, developing, looking at processes, those type things — have helped me look at how to manage change better in the future,” he says. “From a leadership perspective, the biggest thing with me, in kind of like the twilight of my career, is that it’s my job to make sure that somebody in my staff is ready to move up. So the coaching part of it, and how to do the coaching, has been very beneficial.”\n\nAs a seasoned CEO, he says having experienced faculty was quintessential to his success. “All of my professors have real world experience. They’re able to relate to the students, especially the students like myself,” he says. “We can have conversations where I can articulate what I'm dealing with on a day-to-day basis and they understand it. These folks have lived it.”\n\nAvery also says that, even though the degree was offered online, he forged meaningful connections with his classmates, who represent all walks of life. “I was talking about something that we were doing on economic development, and we were trying to determine how to attract young people to Newberry. And there was one young lady who gave me a lesson in life. She said, ‘why don’t you ask them?’ It was like a lightbulb went off in my head.\n\n“This course has taken me to a different level. I wish I had done this 15 years ago,” he adds.\n\nLeading by example, Avery demonstrates the power of education, not just as a way to keep the lights on, but to help oneself and others truly shine.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Newberry, the lifestyle magazine of Newberry County.\n\nThe year 2023 has been extraordinary for the people and campus of Newberry College, with milestones on all fronts. Let's take a look at just some of Wolf Nation's biggest stories from the past year.\n\nA Growing Campus\n\nIn August, Newberry surpassed its own enrollment records for the fifth time in the last nine years with an incoming class of 582 students and total enrollment of 1,521. The figure was a 15% increase over fall 2022. One-in-four new students are the first in their families to go to college, and over 40% come from underserved populations. Plus, the graduating class of fall 2023 was the largest in school history, with 91 graduates — 82 bachelor’s- and nine master’s-level. The College has maintained its personal attention and close-knit community, simultaneously pairing its largest-ever enrollment with a student-to-faculty ratio of 13-to-1.\n\nIn addition to growing by population, campus itself has seen exponential growth and improvement this year. This fall, the College officially opened the Darby Nursing & Health Science Center (left), along with its adjoining health clinic, the Newberry Medical Center of Newberry College, operated by Newberry County Memorial Hospital and led by nurse practitioner Casey Purcell '14.\n\nIn September, the College cut the ribbon on Founders Federal Credit Union Field House, with locker rooms for football, lacrosse and field hockey, coaches’ offices, field-view classrooms and reception areas, along with new east-side stadium seating, revolutionizing the Wolves gameday experience. Also as part of the College's partnership with Founders, the credit union opened its first Newberry branch on campus in Kaufmann Hall.\n\nThe College also partnered with Metz Culinary Management transforming campus dining services and bringing two new national brands, Starbucks and Freshens, to Steele Student Center. In another move toward a more student-centered environment, the campus game room was reimagined and reopened in the basement of Wessels Library. The College has also undertaken renovations of historic MacLean Gymnasium, which celebrated its centennial in 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, work has begun on the College's ninth residence hall, Midlands Hall, at the corner of Luther Street and Wolves Way. The 104-bed hall is expected to be ready for occupancy in fall 2024.\n\nAcademic Advancements\n\nTwo thousand twenty-three has also been a landmark year for academics at Newberry College. Three new undergraduate majors were launched — an online bachelor's in business administration, nutrition, and multi-categorical special education. The College also christened its second and third master's degree programs — an M.S. in sport management & leadership and, just this month, an M.A. in criminal justice. Newberry also launched its prestigious Speech & Debate Team in spring 2023. Shortly thereafter, several members (right) brought home high placements from the South Carolina Speech & Theatre Association’s annual State College Festival Competition (which Newberry College will host in spring 2024).\n\nThe College also welcomed three of its five division deans in 2023 — Dr. Jerry Alewine, of Nursing & Health Sciences; Dr. Steven R. McClung, of Business, Communications & Sport; and Dr. Wiebke Strehl, of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences. The remaining two — Dr. Bret Clark, of Sciences & Mathematics, and Dr. Susan Fernandez, of Education, were appointed in 2022.\n\nA Newberry College education is designed to help students succeed boldly beyond their college careers, thanks in large part to the high caliber of faculty leading its courses and programs. Numerous members of the faculty have made strides in their respective fields this year, including, but not limited to:\n\nDr. Jodie Peeler, professor of communications, who published the first-ever biography of Dave Garroway, original host of NBC's “Today” from 1952-61\n\nDr. Len Lawson, assistant professor of English, who published a new book of poetry and was honored by his undergraduate alma mater with its Alumni Professional Achievement Award\n\nDr. Philip Jacobs, adjunct instructor of art history, who published a book revisiting the significance of Joseph of Nazareth\n\nDr. Sarah Masterson, associate professor of piano and music theory, who won Third Prize in the 2023 Ernst Bacon Memorial Award for the Performance of American Music. In January, she is set to record more solo piano music for a second album\n\nDr. Jonathan Hall, assistant professor of music education, who was recognized by the South Carolina Choral Directors Association with the 2023 Leadership and Service to the Profession Award\n\nExcellence in Athletics\n\nThis year has been huge for Newberry athletics. For starters, the Wolves baseball team (left) took the South Atlantic Conference's regular season and tournament championships, won its first-ever NCAA tournament game, and set a new program record for most wins in a season with 42.\n\nField hockey also enjoyed its best season ever this year. The team racked up a program-high 14 wins before entering the South Atlantic Conference tournament with the No. 2 seed, a bye, and a regular season of 11-3. The historic season came to a close in the semifinals with a 1-0 loss to Limestone.\n\nThe Wolves' men's lacrosse team was crowned NCAA Statistical Champion for the spring 2023 season, with a .520 percentage when up a man on the offensive end with 39 extra man goals on 75 attempts. The Wolves also finished the season third in the nation with a .370 shot percentage. The Wolves' season ended with an 11-5 record and a SAC semifinal appearance. This was the first statistical championship in program history.\n\nIn November, Newberry's women's triathlon team finished eighth in the NCAA National Championship in Tempe, Arizona, marking the first time in program history in which the Wolves competed at nationals as a complete team.\n\nThe College has also launched two new sports — women's acrobatics & tumbling and women’s wrestling — which are both set to begin competition in the 2024-25 seasons.\n\nAffordability & Diversity\n\nIn 2023, the Newberry Board of Trustees renewed the College's Tuition Promise, which freezes tuition rates for incoming students at the time of enrollment. In addition to traditional undergraduates, the measure has been extended to students in the College's growing online and graduate programs. The Tuition Promise is one reason why Newberry was once again named No. 1 in South Carolina for least student loan debt per borrower, according to LendEDU.\n\nThis year, the College opened the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging, and welcomed its inaugural vice president, Dr. Altheia Richardson (right). The College's Board of Trustees also elected its first woman chair, Dr. Lenna Corley Young '77.\n\nRising as a Regional Leader\n\nIn addition to the No. 1 ranking by LendEDU, Newberry has risen in every category in which it is ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Newberry rose to No. 10 among the South's Best Regional Colleges, an all-time high, and rose to No. 3 for Best Value, No. 4 for Social Mobility, and No. 2 among Best Colleges for Veterans.\n\nNEWBERRY — Darius Starks ’16 has been playing saxophone since the age of 10. Nineteen years later, and seven after earning his music degree, he is coming home to make his debut at the Newberry Opera House.\n\nStarks will perform Sunday, Dec. 17, at 6 p.m. alongside David Glymph and Steven Galloway, who together form the soul-stirring trio DSG. The group’s smooth harmonies across contemporary jazz and R&B will be an unforgettable start to the Christmas season.\n\nStarks says he first fell in love with the instrument at a revival service at his grandmother's church, Columbia’s Temple Zion Baptist, where Greg Whittaker was playing as a guest. (As an interesting side note, Whittaker has been a member of the Lowcountry’s Deas Guyz Band, founded by another Newberry grad, Reggie Deas '89.)\n\n“He played 'Amazing Grace,' and it just brought chills,” he says. “I asked my dad, after he finished playing, like, ‘what is that?’ and he said, ‘a saxophone.’ And I knew right then, I wanted to be just like him when I grew up. And for Christmas, my dad got me a saxophone, and I’ve never put it down since then.”\n\nStaring when he was in fifth grade, Starks began taking lessons. The Irmo native played football for two years in high school, then decided to go out for the marching band. His junior year, he was Rookie of the Year, and then Woodwind Captain the next. Even at this stage, Starks says he was performing in front of audiences as a solo artist.\n\n“I would play at my grandmother’s church at the beginning, then I moved to [Right Direction Church] and was part of the band. From playing every Sunday, they asked me for small little gigs here and there, weddings and stuff like that. One gig would lead to the next gig, and it just kind of started from there, and it progressed definitely after college.”\n\nHis journey led him up the road to Newberry College, where he studied under the likes of woodwinds professor Dr. Barry McGinnis, professor emeritus and director of bands Bill Long, and director of bands and jazz conductor Dr. Jerry Gatch.\n\n“My experience at Newberry was great. It was a small community, everyone knew each other. I was part of the [Call Me] MISTER program. It was like a close-knit family, apart from my own family,” he says.\n\nAt Newberry, Starks was a member of the Scarlet Spirit Marching Band, the saxophone quartet, the College Singers, and the Jazz Big Band, which named him Most Valuable Player in 2015. The College band also gave him the opportunity to perform alongside big names, including trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis and “The Late Show” trumpeter Al Chez.\n\n“Newberry definitely gave me the work ethic to practice every day. Dr. McGinnis was on us about perfecting our craft and devoting at least one or two hours a day to perfect your instrument,” he says. “We had a lot of performances, going around to different schools, jazz tours, even choir tours, just the experience of performing in front of people, getting comfortable in front of a crowd.”\n\nAfter graduation, Starks took his musical and business skills to work as a full-time musician, performing solo and group shows, weddings and parties, and creating content across social media platforms. He released an EP, “Christmas in the Key of D” in 2018, and he has performed on television shows such as “Good Day Columbia.” He has performed in Washington State, Connecticut, Chicago, New Orleans and across the South. He has a “residency” at Halls Chophouse in Columbia, where he performs for brunch each Sunday. This summer, he, Galloway, and Glymph formed DSG, and the group is rapidly growing in skill and acclaim.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time, crossing pathways, and we’ve been trying to get something together,” he says of the group. “It just kind of happened this summer. We decided to do a video, [a cover of Boyz II Men’s “I'll Make Love to You”] that’s still going viral. I had the Newberry Opera House already booked earlier this year, so I wanted to bring my group with me. We get a lot further with us coming together.”\n\nStarks says he’s looking forward to recording an original single with his group and performing in bigger and more exotic venues, such as a wedding in Cancun booked for next year.\n\nTo purchase tickets to Starks’ Dec. 17 show, click here.\n\nTo learn more about his work, visit DariusStarksMusic.com and follow him on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBATESBURG-LEESVILLE, S.C. — Throughout his 97 years, Otho L. Shealy ’48 has played parts in both local and world history. His life’s journey has taken him around the world, from his home in Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina, to Newberry College, to scorched cityscapes of postwar Europe, and back.\n\nLast summer, he came across his ticket to the world’s first experiment in international criminal law, the 1946 Nuremberg Trials, which he was able to attend while stationed there as a medic immediately following World War II. He donated the pass to the South Carolina Military Museum in Columbia, where, opposite Great War gas masks and an M48 Patton main battle tank, it represents a path to peace.\n\nThe discovery gave us a chance to catch up with Shealy at his family’s business, Economy Furniture Co., where he happily reports to work five days a week.\n\nWhen Shealy (right) arrived on the Newberry College campus, fresh out of high school on the eve of summer 1943, he was the youngest of just 31 men enrolled. At the height of the Second World War, most college-age men and even some professors were spending their semesters across opposing seas or marking time somewhere in between. For Shealy, weeks away from his 17th birthday, age wasn’t just a number. It was the only thing standing between him and the arms to which conscience and country called. He looked forward to becoming a pilot in the Air Corps — the branch known as the Air Force didn’t exist until 1947.\n\nWeeks after he enrolled, on July 31, Newberry life was drummed to a whole new cadence. Three hundred twenty-five cadets in the U.S. Navy’s V-12 program, designed to supplement the supply of trained officers, took up residence on campus. The College provided the facilities and academic training, while the Navy handled discipline, physical fitness and military drill. Cadets came from among college students, various reserve programs, enlisted men from the fleet, and high school seniors who passed the nationwide qualifying examination. Newberry — one of two South Carolina colleges and 131 campuses nationwide to host V-12 — educated over 1,000 cadets in its 27 months of participation.\n\n“The boys that were there when I first went there that summer were probably gone the next year,” says Shealy. “I didn’t think about it, then, being such a serious time. We were playboys. We were ready to shoot more pool and play more cards. And just wait till tomorrow, I’m gonna get my notice that I’m supposed to report for service.”\n\nDuring his first year-and-a-half at Newberry, Shealy studied math & natural sciences, as it was known then, a versatile major encompassing mathematics, biology and chemistry. “I can’t say that I was going to be a doctor,” he says. “But I always liked the sciences.”\n\nDuring his sophomore year, he crossed paths with a two-year business student from Savannah named Mary Reiser (1927-2020). Dark-haired, dimpled and outgoing, she was a leader among her classmates — president of the business students, secretary of the Y.W.C.A., and a member of the Newberry Players. “She got my attention,” he says.\n\nUnfortunately, their relationship didn’t have long to bloom before Shealy’s number came up in December 1944, just as the Battle of the Bulge was taking shape in western Europe. Before he left Newberry, the pair promised to write each other. He was inducted into the Air Corps in January, and was sent promptly to Biloxi, Mississippi, for basic training, and from there to B-29 gunnery school in Florida. By this time, however, Germany had surrendered, and all eyes were on the war in the Pacific.\n\n“In Florida, I understood that we had around 15,000 cadets that were being prepared in some way. We had been told, before they dropped the A-bomb, that we would be going to Nebraska, and then would be assigned to a B-29 that would go to the south Pacific. So we were that close,” he says.\n\nLuckily, Japan surrendered weeks later on Aug. 15. As the theaters of action fell quiet, Shealy and his compatriots were “bounced around” as the United States determined its next moves in a postwar world. After serving and training at various stateside bases, he boarded the Pontotoc Victory in January 1946 to assume his new post among the Allies occupying Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nWhen Shealy arrived, the city, like many others in Germany at the end of the war, was a skeleton of its former self. “Many of the little villages that the train would go through, you could never tell a war was there. But anywhere that was of much size, there had been nothing done. Inside the walled city was known then as 95% destroyed,” he says. “The whole year, I didn’t see any work going on to rebuild.”\n\nThanks to his math & natural science coursework at Newberry, Shealy was assigned to a medical unit. “I didn’t ask for it, but that became a real blessing. First, I could drive almost anything. I had driven everything when I was [at home], and back then it was all straight shifts. The ambulance was a good fit for me.\n\n“We had a place that a patient could lie down to be examined, but nothing much more than that. I remember Dr. Floyd, and we acted as his nurses. Giving shots was one of the biggest things. I can just see them right on today, lines of GIs there for their different kinds of shots. What meant more to me was taking patients to the hospital in Nuremberg. I think about some of them that I carried there.”\n\nThroughout his assignment in Nuremberg, the International Military Tribunal was underway. In what became known as the Nuremberg Trials, the Allied coalition of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union tried two dozen surviving leaders of Nazi Germany. The charges included crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and conspiracy. Shealy was able to obtain a pass to attend a session of the trial.\n\n“In your seat, you put your headphones on, and you could dial it to English and hear what was being said, because it was all done in German. I can still see the Germans seated on two rows. I can still see the guards standing behind them. I don’t remember any one of the prisoners saying anything. At the time, it was like just another day,” he says.\n\nShortly after the trial ended and sentences were handed down, on Oct. 16, 1946, the day 10 of the Nazi defendants were to be executed, Shealy was shipped out. Back in the States, during his stay at Camp Kilmer, in New Jersey, Shealy remembers taking a detour to the City That Never Sleeps. “We’d heard some of the radio stuff from New York City, so several of us got a cab to take us from Camp Kilmer to New York and put us out. We went to NBC, we went to the Chesterfield hour, and there was the first TV I ever saw.”\n\nAfter he was discharged and spent Christmas at home in Leesville, he picked up his college career where he left off two years before.\n\nWithin a few weeks of his return to Newberry, he found himself a player in what would become local lore. According to the late College archivist Gordon Henry (1931-2020), on Jan. 31, 1947, Newberry played rival Presbyterian College in basketball, in what would later be named MacLean Gymnasium. Legend has it that a Newberry student climbed a ladder on the outside of the building, into an open window behind the visitors’ stands, and took a bowler hat off the head of a Blue Hose. Former student Corrin Bowers would later write that the hat was originally his, and that the whole operation was merely to recover stolen property.\n\n“You know who helped hold the ladder?” Shealy asks. “You’re looking at him! This fellow with this hat on, he was making a lot of noise. We lifted the hat out the window and I didn’t know where it went to.”\n\nSeveral altercations ensued after the game. Soon after, Presbyterian’s public relations director, Charles MacDonald, wrote Frank Kinard ’47 (1924-2021), Newberry’s sports publicity director, suggesting that the hat be recovered and made into a symbol of the schools’ rivalry. The hat was turned in anonymously, cast in bronze, and the Bronze Derby was born. The trophy would be passed to the victor of each meeting in basketball, baseball and football until 1956, and only in football until 2006, just before PC left Division II. Photo from the 1974 \"Newberrian.\"\n\nAfter settling back into student life, Shealy joined the College Singers, where he sharpened his vocal skills and connected with the director, fellow veteran Dr. Milton Moore (1914-94). Moore left Newberry to serve in the U.S. Army, where he served in north Africa and in Italy. “We probably spent half of our time together talking about our experiences in the service,” he says.\n\nShealy graduated in spring 1948, and took a position in Savannah as a chemist for Southern Cotton Oil Co. However, he admits he moved to Savannah for a different kind of chemistry. “Mary was working as a secretary for a building and loan place. She lived around the corner,” he says.\n\nTheir relationship budded in letters from across the sea. Now that they were reunited, it wasn’t long before wedding bells echoed from the church steeple. Their marriage would thrive for 71 years.\n\n“In the meantime, my daddy offered me a job at the store with him, and he’d pay me the same thing I was getting paid down there, which was $200 a month. That was pretty good pay back at that time,” he says.\n\nSince then, Shealy has worked alongside his family for most of the 84 years that Economy Furniture has been in business. It also happens that these three generations of Shealys are also Newberry College graduates, including (in photo order) Betsy Shealy Dority ’06, Brian Shealy ’04, and Brent Shealy ’77. At 97, Otho Shealy (seated) has no plans to retire, instead hoping to continue the work he enjoys for as long as he can. He has not only more stories to tell, but more to write.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. — Bill Hilton Jr. '70 has received South Carolina’s highest civilian honor for his contributions to science, nature and education. Gov. Henry McMaster awarded him with the Order of the Palmetto to recognize his life’s work, which includes bird banding, teaching, preservation, and serving his alma mater.\n\nBird banding involves catching and tagging birds to better study and identify them, as well as to monitor the health of bird populations. Hilton began banding birds in South Carolina in 1982, the same year he established Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History near his home in York. As of press time, Hilton has banded 78,814 birds of 127 species in his 41 years of practice.\n\n“That's a lot of birds,” said Hilton. “A lot of those I banded and never saw again, either they were in migration, or they just dispersed or whatever. But a lot of them have been resident birds or have come back after migrating away. They've been adding to the understanding of the behavioral ecology of birds in the Carolinas.\n\n“Since very little banding is done in the Carolina Piedmont, the work I'm doing here has potential for significant information that we wouldn’t have otherwise,” he added.\n\nHilton said bird banders catch birds using a variety of live traps and nets, affix a numbered band, issued by the Bird Banding Laboratory, to one of the birds’ legs, take a variety of measurements, and then release them. The identification allows other banders to record their findings in the national bird banding database, which compiles information on movements, longevity, site fidelity and more.\n\n“I think the furthest bird I've had was in Newfoundland, and that's pretty far to go,” said Hilton. “Not all of them are long-distance, but quite a few of them are.”\n\nWhile he has documented many species, his specialty is the ruby-throated hummingbird (one of which he is holding at right). The species can be found in the Carolinas during the spring, summer and fall, but they migrate south for the winter. Hilton is one of a select few who have studied them on the other end of their migration to Central America.\n\n“I’ve taken 30 different groups of citizen-scientists to the Neotropics — Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize — and we made a lot of discoveries down there that were unknown about ruby-throats on their wintering grounds,” he said.\n\nAfter graduating from Newberry College with a degree in philosophy, Hilton earned a master’s in teaching biology from Winthrop University. He then traveled to Minnesota, where he banded and studied Blue Jays while earning his master’s in ecology and behavioral biology from the University of Minnesota. After returning to the Palmetto State, he taught high school biology and established his namesake nature center, the only year-round, long-term banding site in the Carolinas.\n\nIn addition to pioneering ornithology in South Carolina, Hilton’s other accomplishments include helping to establish the Governor's School for Science & Mathematics with his wife, Susan Ballard Hilton '71; as well as working with the Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden, the Allison Woods Foundation, and RibbonWalk, Charlotte’s Botanical Forest.\n\nAt Newberry College, Hilton chaired the John Bachman Symposium of 2006 and served as president of the Alumni Association, which included a stint on the Newberry College Board of Trustees, from 2004-06. For his achievements and service, Hilton has been honored with a charter membership in the Hall of Master Teachers (2012), an honorary Doctor of Science degree (2013), and the Alumni Distinguished Service Award (2021), among many others.\n\nHilton was nominated for the Order of the Palmetto by his state senator, Mike Fanning, who surprised him with the news on his 77th birthday.\n\nHilton refuses to use the word, “retired.” A lifelong educator, Hilton encourages everyone to do their research about what they can do to help birds, prevent further habitat loss, and enjoy nature.\n\n“Birds are a really good indicator of the health of the environment, and there are a lot of indications that our environment is not all that healthy,” he said. “I encourage people to do away with manicured lawns and put in native plants, put out a bird feeder and maintain it properly, and watch what happens.\n\n“People don’t have to go to foreign countries or across the U.S. to see nature. The best place to watch nature, in my mind, is in your own backyard. Get familiar with what you have and what you can do to provide habitat right out your back door,” he said.\n\nTo watch CN2 News' special report (1:50), click here.\n\nTo learn more about Hilton’s ongoing research, visit hiltonpond.org.\n\nNEWBERRY — Dr. Joe McDonald, professor emeritus of sociology at Newberry College, has detailed the largely unknown events of the Civil Rights Movement in Newberry in his new book, \"'With All Deliberate Speed' - School Desegregation in Newberry: A Story of Protest and Resistance.\"\n\nMcDonald will give a free talk on his book Sunday, Sept. 17, at 3 p.m. at the Old Newberry Hotel, 1110 Caldwell St. in Newberry.\n\nHis book centers around the 1969 student boycott at Gallman High, the county's high school for Black students. He argues that this event was part of the national movement for equality, and was instrumental in bringing about reform in the rural community.\n\n\"It's good to know where your community has been, and how we got to where we are now, and I think this was an important event, really, in changing race relations,\" said McDonald. \"Once this had happened, I think opportunities really opened up for the for the Black community, and so it really made its mark on our very history.\"\n\nMcDonald said that, despite his living in Newberry for over four decades, he had never heard of the boycott until a chance meeting in 2019.\n\n\"I was doing some work with the Newberry Literacy Council, an adult education program, and we were running some college-like seminars for people in the community. One of the participants brought his brother along, who was visiting from Alabama, and he just mentioned, during our discussion about South Carolina history, about the boycott at Gallman High. I thought, this needs to be written down, needs to be part of Newberry history,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald took several interviews with students and teachers, beginning with this one gentleman, who was one of the boycott's organizers. He pulled archived issues of the Newberry Observer and other papers around the state. He then tied the local movement to the events happening at the national level.\n\n\"The first chapter of the book starts back in 1896, with the Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld 'separate but equal,'\" he said. \"That really began the whole Jim Crow era. Then in 1954, the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education finally declared 'separate but equal' unconstitutional. But very little happend from 1954 to 1964, when Congress passed legislation demanding school desegregation. The Gallman boycott of 1969 is part of that story. The schools were finally desegregated in the fall of 1970.\n\n\"The students all refused to go to class the first few weeks of the semester. Some students stayed out the whole semester. The students organized marches. They appeared before the school board. They engaged in all kinds of things that were typical of the Civil Rights Movement at the time. It was civil disobedience. This was not just an isolated series of events. Newberry was part of the nation's history and the history of the movement. A lot of the older Black citizens know about this, but most of the other population, I don't think we know anything about these events, which have been sort of ignored up to this point,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald taught sociology at Newberry College from 2006 until his retirement in 2014. He and his wife, Mary, are the proud owners of the Old Newberry Hotel, having renovated and revitalized the historic property after years of abandonment.\n\nCopies of McDonald's book will be available at the Sunday talk, and are also available from BookBaby, Amazon, ThriftBooks and Barnes & Noble.\n\nPhoto: Ted B. Williams / Newberry Magazine\n\nNEWBERRY — Nearly one year since conferring its inaugural master’s degrees of the 21st century, Newberry College is celebrating its fourth cohort of graduates in organizational development & leadership.\n\nThe graduates include: Jackie Aldrete ’21 (Oxnard, California), Nicole Borowinski (San Diego), Olivia Diggs ’22 (Titusville, Florida), Dre Harris ’21 (Greenville), Ryan Heriot ’22 (Fort Mill), Kody Varn ’22 (Clinton) and Jon Williams ’22 (Irmo).\n\nWhile the versatile online program is open to anyone, it so happened that each member of this cohort is no stranger to Newberry College, having earned their Newberry bachelor's degree or having coached for Wolves athletics.\n\nThe graduates, like those before them, have experienced professional and personal growth as a result of their academic achievements in this program.\n\n“I would say that something that I wish I would have known at the beginning of this journey would be how much of a growing process I would go through within the year,” said Borowinski, who was recently promoted to assistant head women’s soccer coach at Newberry College. “This program really pushed me out of my comfort zone and pushed me to grow.”\n\nBorowinski said her research, “Finding Identity Beyond Sports: A Journey of Transition and Transformation,” has immediate, real-world applications in her career.\n\n“I want to utilize the knowledge that I have gained and truly help athletes and their families before the retirement process,” she said.\n\nHarris — who led Newberry’s football team to consecutive South Atlantic Conference championships in 2021 and 2022 — finished his master’s degree from Germany, where he plays American football professionally with the Regensburg Phoenix. His research, “The Building of Team Camaraderie Overseas,” went beyond academic theorizing for the rookie chasing his dreams across the pond.\n\n“The task of taking on a major capstone project in the beginning stages of being a pro athlete has honestly been one of the best things that could've happened,” said Harris. “Getting to experience how a functional organization operates gave me insight that I will be able to carry on for the rest of my leadership journey.”\n\nTwo of Harris’ teammates, Heriot and Varn, will finish their final seasons on the Wolves football team this fall. Each of them also focused their research close to home, dealing with safety practices for community athletic facilities and stress of college football players, respectively. Heriot will take his newest leadership and communication skills back home, going into business in neighboring Charlotte. Varn aspires to a career in athletic administration.\n\nAldrete completed her degree from her home in California. After earning her bachelor’s in chemistry and playing forward on the Wolves women’s soccer team, her master’s studies allowed her to combine her passions for science and sports. Her capstone project examined the role leadership and communication play for athletes when choosing a college.\n\n“Leading involves making well-informed decisions and implementing constructive changes, and action research offers me a systematic approach to achieving these objectives through a structured framework,” she said. “Having such a supportive staff and faculty was very nice and I would highly recommend this program to anyone who's looking to seek further education, or just willing to learn more about how leadership goes beyond being in an authoritative role.”\n\nAldrete plans to pursue forensic chemistry in a crime lab unit, with aspirations to join the FBI.\n\n“One of the many things that I love about this program is that I can apply it anywhere I go and with anything that I choose to do,” she added.\n\nWilliams aligned his graduate research with his undergraduate studies in health care management and accounting. His capstone was titled, “Enhancing Small Business Growth in the Post-COVID Era: Strategies for Navigating Government Contract Bidding.”\n\n“This program has taught me a lot about myself, what I'm capable of, and it taught me what kind of leader I am and want to be,” he said.\n\nDiggs, an alumna of the Wolves volleyball team, researched pay equity in sports. She plans to continue her Newberry education even further with an internship as an athletic communication assistant.\n\n“My biggest takeaway from the MSODL program is being able to take the leadership skills I learned throughout the program to better myself and understand how to lead different people,” she said.\n\nThe seven graduates will be formally recognized at fall commencement on Dec. 8.\n\nThe August cohort brings the total number of Newberry’s master’s-level alumni to 15, with that number expected to double by summer 2024. At press time, there are 47 students currently enrolled across both graduate programs.\n\nNewberry’s second master’s program, in sport management & leadership, has begun its inaugural classes after achieving approval in January. Other graduate programs are in development, including criminal justice, education, public policy, and teaching.\n\nPhoto: Fall graduating class of 2022 on Commencement Day, Dec. 9, 2022.\n\nA bright glint on the high school diamonds of western North Carolina, Rusty Pulliam dreamed of pitching in the big league.\n\nIn 1976, with his diploma from Asheville’s T.C. Roberson High School and a full scholarship to Western Carolina in hand, Pulliam set off. He was second on the Catamounts’ pitching roster, and he didn’t lose a single game.\n\nBut the spring of 1977 also came with challenges at home. His parents had filed for divorce, and that May, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. His college career would have to take a detour.\n\n“My mother and I had moved out from our home, my parents had split up, and so I felt like I needed to stay at home and take care of my mother,” he said.\n\nHe transferred to Montreat-Anderson, a junior college 18 miles east of Asheville (present-day Montreat College).\n\n“I went from being a big fish in a big pond to a small fish in a smaller pond, but I needed to be there,” he said. “While I was at Montreat-Anderson, we played the No. 1 ranked junior college team in the U.S., Valencia College, in Orlando, Florida. We lost two-to-one, and they had mad players on that team that were drafted into the pros.\n\n“While I was pitching that day, the head east coast scout for the Atlanta Braves, a man named Smokey Burgess, was there,” said Pulliam. “He was flying from Palm Beach to Columbia, South Carolina. Jack Rhine had just been named head baseball coach at Newberry College, and they happened to be sitting beside each other on the plane. Coach Rhine asked him if he saw any players that he would recommend for scholarships. And he gave him my name and said this is a kid who pitched a great game against a great team.”\n\nThe next day, the Pulliams’ phone rang. Rhine extended Rusty and his mother an invitation to visit Newberry, along with a full scholarship, if he wanted it.\n\n“I did go down and visit and told Coach Rhine at the time, I had started having some issues with my pitching arm my sophomore year. I said I had pitched that year several times in pain and I didn’t know what was going on. And he said, ‘Well, that's not going to deter me from offering you a scholarship.’\n\n“I went down to visit the school, and they had a great school of business. At that time, it was the No. 1 ranked school of business in South Carolina, headed up by Dr. Sandra Logan (1940 - 2014). I wanted to major in business, which I did,” he said.\n\nPulliam transferred to Newberry and got off to a great start. But during fall workouts and practices, it became clear that the twinge in his shoulder wasn't going away. Rhine pulled some strings and sent Pulliam to see the team doctor for the Boston Red Sox. Following the thrill of the proximity to greatness, the visit brought devastating news.\n\n“They found that I had a torn labrum. They would’ve had to cut it wide open and he said your chances of ever coming back and pitching on a high level, whether it was college or pros, would be pretty much like two percent.\n\n\"That was the longest trip coming back from there with my dad, knowing that my baseball career was done,” he said.\n\nAfter returning to Newberry, he voluntarily gave up his baseball scholarship, saying it could help another good player. He stayed on the team, however, and was able to pitch in four games his senior year.\n\nAfter the diagnosis, Pulliam doubled down on his studies in business administration. Easier said than done, he said.\n\n“It was a difficult core of business classes. It was kind of like going to boot camp, I mean, it put me through the wringer. When I graduated in 1980, there was only one other baseball player that finished in business. It was really tough,” he said. “It pushed me to study and broaden my mind and my skillset, going from being focused on being an athlete to more being focused on being a good student.”\n\nHe said that in some of his classes, like price theory, only one-in-three students passed, at least the first time. He said he had to really fight for each letter grade, but that the academic rigor eventually paid off.\n\n“The discipline, knowing you’re doing something that most kids wouldn’t do. There were a lot of kids that dropped out of that major because it was so tough. But I learned a lot,” he said.\n\nBetween study sessions, Pulliam indulged in a burger, or two, at Dopey’s — the beloved dive on the edge of campus that served diner fare from 1950 until the owners’ retirement in 2017.\n\n“When we would bet on games, we wouldn’t bet money. It was Dopey’s burgers,” he said. “Those were very fun times.”\n\nPulliam received his well-earned diploma in spring 1980, spent a few years in banking, and then took up real estate, his passion and success for the last 38 years. Today, Pulliam Properties is western North Carolina’s largest full-service commercial real estate firm, with 72 commercial projects developed across multiple states.\n\n“I had four unique years in college, but I’ve had a career far greater than I could’ve dreamed of. My mom ended up beating cancer. I had two great years at Newberry that helped me to be very successful,” he said. “It was the best experience I could’ve had. I wouldn’t change that.”\n\nAn aspiring high school teacher and softball coach. A grandmother-of-two with an established career in human resources. A returning alumna climbing the ladder at UPS. A pastor, professor and college administrator. A defensive lineman on the verge of going pro. A collegiate cheer coach. A young alumna working in the nonprofit sector.\n\nThese seven individuals come from backgrounds diverse in every way: age, race, education, gender, industry, family, aspirations. But they all hold at least one thing in common: They are the first to earn master’s degrees from Newberry College in nearly a century.\n\nA year after they enrolled, they each received their respective graduate diplomas in organizational development & leadership. The online program was designed not only for leaders of organizations — of every kind — but for anyone for whom personal and professional growth is a worthy goal. The curriculum covers organizational behavior, change and talent management, performance optimization, leadership, and communication. Its students (and now alumni) are as diverse as the program is versatile.\n\nSince the flagship program’s launch in 2021, the College has christened a second graduate degree, a Master of Science in sport management & leadership. The newest program comes amid the College’s emergence as an impactful force in the online and graduate space, taking its signature passion, purpose and personal attention beyond the traditional, in-person, undergraduate realm. Starting this fall, the College will also offer an online bachelor’s degree in business administration alongside existing offerings in criminal justice, psychology, respiratory therapy, and RN-to-BSN. Plans are in the works for the College to add graduate programs in criminal justice, public administration, and education in coming years.\n\nThe SML program will incorporate many of the themes covered in the ODL program, along with coursework in sport business, finance, marketing, public relations, and research. Both programs are offered completely online. Students of each program can earn their degree within 12 months of the Aug. 21 course launch, and applications are still being accepted for the upcoming term.\n\nWe caught up with several ODL graduates, the College’s first graduate-level alumni, who earned their degrees in August and December 2022. So far, none of them have limited their praise for the program to the professional sphere, but testified to holistic growth since logging on for their first class.\n\n“The MSODL was a life-changing experience,” said Justina Teale, who earned her degree three years into her career as head Wolves cheerleading coach. “In a year of my program, Dr. [Jacki] Wisler poured so much into my life both professionally and personally. This institution has given me more than just a higher education. It has given me friends, family, and future growing professionals that I get to help mold.”\n\nSince earning her degree, Teale has begun teaching College 101 courses to first-year students, on top of her role as cheer coach.\n\nThe inaugural class’ members also span generations and stages in career. Chaunel Johnson (right) has worked in human resources for 15 years, recently became a new grandmother, and started a new job three months into the program.\n\n“I was slightly anxious because I had not been in school since 2005,” she said. “What I didn't expect was for it to produce such growth and development in a personal way that I experienced.”\n\nJohnson said her degree has not only allowed her to expand the contributions of her professional role. The program also gave her confidence to take on work and speaking opportunities as a consultant, helping other organizations. In March, she outlined the importance of competencies in job descriptions before the Charlotte chapter of the National Association of African Americans in Human Resources. She has also led similar talks and workshops across the country.\n\n“I was able to use content from my studies to for that presentation. Public speaking is a place in which I feel very comfortable. I desire to do much, much more of that, to teach in universities, to acquire many facilitation opportunities,” she said.\n\n“I believe that the program will impact many lives, not just the lives of the students that participate and acquire their degrees, but the people who will benefit from their presence in their organizations,” Johnson added. “I appreciate Newberry affording opportunities that have greatly impacted my life in a positive way and armed me to be successful in my future pursuits.”\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Christina Wendland joined the Newberry College faculty in 2007, and she now also serves as associate dean of academic affairs. Her daughter, Kayla, earned her bachelor’s from Newberry in 2021. As a professor and administrator, Wendland “jumped at the chance” not only to switch roles and experience the program from the ground up, but to continue her own education.\n\n“As a professor who regularly teaches online courses, it was quite a different experience being a student,” she said. “I experienced both the joys and the trials of student life. … Absolutely the biggest takeaway for me is the ability to see the larger picture … I believe I am a better leader because of what I learned in this program.”\n\nCaroline Addison ’20 had long planned to take her Newberry bachelor’s in communications to work for a nonprofit. With this program, her alma mater offered yet another way to help chase her dreams. She now serves as a community outreach coordinator for Agape of Central Alabama, a faith-based foster care and adoption agency.\n\nAnother undergraduate communications alumna, Megan Horton ’06, put her degree to work for UPS after graduation, progressing from sales to HR project management. For her, the program represented a “new Newberry,” and now she is taking her new degree back to her company. Left: Addison and Horton pose before fall 2022 commencement.\n\n“My professors took a vested interest in me, my success and challenged me to dig deeper when solving complex problems,” she said. “The program is challenging and takes a lot of commitment and discipline to achieve. … I found opportunities to dig into business challenges at my organization and use the time in my courses to try new approaches, bringing it back to my professional role to test the methods and find new solutions.”\n\nThe program has made such a difference in her life that Horton is “invested in the success of the program long-term.” She makes a point of “spreading the good news” to prospective students, especially fellow undergraduate alumni in whom any potential remains untapped.\n\nFor more information about Newberry’s online and graduate programs, please contact Bill Kuehl, director of online and graduate studies enrollment, at 803.321.5276 or OnlineAdmissions@newberry.edu.\n\nTop: The August 2022 master's program graduates: Teale, Ty'Ran Dixon '21, M'22, Wendland, Johnson, and Hannah Towery '21, M'22.\n\nA previous version of this article appeared in the spring 2023 issue of Dimensions, the magazine for alumni and friends of Newberry College.

Juneteenth is an important milestone in American culture. After President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, freeing our enslaved ancestors in the Confederacy, the news didn’t reach parts of the American South until after the Civil War ended (April 1865). In fact, more than 250,000 enslaved people in Texas didn’t receive the news until June 19, 1865. Yes, you read that right; a quarter-of-a-million people continued to suffer in slavery for two-and-a-half years after it was outlawed. You may be thinking, since it was a different time with limited communication outreach to citizens, such as internet and computers, that may have been the reason. Well, not exactly!\n\nOn the evening of April 14, when President Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth while attending a concert at the Ford’s Theatre, news of the president’s passing the next day spread quickly thereafter. In other words, important news could reach the entire country, if the people in charge of local newspapers chose to report it. Finally, on June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform the Lone Star State that slavery was outlawed in formerly Confederate states. Unfortunately, the path to liberation didn’t end there.\n\nWhen Union soldiers delivered the news, the ex-Confederate mayor of Galveston openly disregarded Granger’s orders and forced freed people back to work. On the local plantations, it was up to the enslavers to decide when and how to announce the news to enslaved men and women. Many enslavers waited until the harvesting process was complete so they could make a profit off their harvest and keep control over the enslaved. Even “legally” free Black men and women continued to be terrorized, shot, and hanged for minor “offenses” like expecting fair treatment from their employers or wanting to have the same basic rights as their White counterparts. As a nation, we are still battling the age-old curse of racism. People of color are still on the front lines fighting for their rights and freedom.\n\nIn 1872, seven years after Granger announced slavery was outlawed in formerly Confederate states, a group of Black ministers and businessmen raised enough money to purchase 10 acres of park land in Texas. The land, now known as Emancipation Park, offered surrounding Black communities a safe place they could celebrate Juneteenth. Many Americans have visited the site over the years to commemorate sacrifices made throughout the African American culture.\n\nJuneteenth has been celebrated with a sense of jubilation and the need to educate and empower those who are in our communities. Parties, barbecues, and church services were held, and there was a focus on how to pursue the so-called “American Dream.” Former enslaved men and women were freed to do things that they were restricted from doing such as praying, gathering, reading, and writing. The history of Juneteenth is not as recognized now as it once was due to limited knowledge and information in educational textbooks. With more awareness and more willingness to engage in research, many are determined to bring it back to the forefront. As a nation, we typically celebrate the Fourth of July during the summer. However, from an African American history standpoint, while we were independent as a nation, our ancestors weren’t independent, we weren’t free as a people. So, there has been a lot of conversation over the years about how we’re celebrating the American holiday, but not fully celebrating the day we were truly freed from slavery. As we continue to broaden our knowledge about Juneteenth and pay homage to our ancestors for all the many sacrifices they’ve made, it is vital that we continue to pass down our history to our younger generations. So they, too, will understand the ultimate sacrifices made for us to celebrate our freedom.\n\nFor some, it's eating barbecue, shooting fireworks, gathering at a cookout, and drinking hibiscus tea. This tea is a cure to help lower blood pressure, a tradition that symbolizes perseverance and honors the blood that was shed by African Americans. Some traditional foods that are cooked during the Juneteenth holiday are black-eyed peas and pork, which is a representation of wealth. Some other food for prosperity and side dishes consist of corn, cornbread, collard greens, cabbage, potatoes, yams and sweet potatoes. Like the New Year’s celebration in the African American community, many may recognize the foods that are cooked during Juneteenth. It’s all about celebrating good luck and wishing for the best! It is equally important that we as a culture and nation find healthier options, such as vegan and vegetarian. Fish fries, crab boils, and other seafood options are great ways to utilize a healthier way of eating.\n\nNow that more Americans are out and about, the City of Newberry was excited to offer the Third Annual Newberry Juneteenth Festival last weekend. The Newberry Juneteenth committee consists of Councilwoman Jackie Holmes, Councilman Carlton Kinard, Barbara Chapman, Sheila Brown, Margo Whitener, Mike Raiford, Tomekia Means, Yolanda Hair and Denise Graham. All are welcome to participate in the annual festival, celebrating Black-owned businesses, enjoying live music, delicious food, a talent showcase and car show, and visiting Juneteenth history displays at the Newberry Opera House. Even though many folks may not be familiar with the Juneteenth celebrations coming forth, we are hopeful that all Newberrians will enjoy a fun-filled day with family and friends.\n\nNEWBERRY — Dr. Jodie M. Peeler, professor of communications at Newberry College, has published a new book, \"Peace: The Wide, Wide World of Dave Garroway, Television's Original Master Communicator\" (Tyger River Press, 2023).\n\nPeeler's book is the first to cover the life of the groundbreaking original host of NBC’s morning show, “Today.” Garroway hosted the show from 1952 until 1961.\n\n“I have been fascinated with television history for almost as long as I can remember, and Dave Garroway was a big presence in those days,” said Peeler. “The older I got, the more it bothered me that he was so forgotten, or that when he was talked about, it was in terms of how he died or about his later years, when his world started to fall apart.”\n\nPeeler dove into the subject in 2015, when she befriended radio journalist Brandon Hollingsworth, who had begun work on his own biography of Garroway. The two decided to combine their efforts, and Hollingsworth compiled much of the sourc"
