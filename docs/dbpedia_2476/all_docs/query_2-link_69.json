        "text": "Photograph 1: Mayo Clinic employee photograph of Dr. John Silas Lundy, undated.\n\nPhotograph 2: Alice Magaw Kessel, undated.\n\nInitial Announcement\n\nThis is the first of 80 weekly email updates that you will receive as we celebrate the Mayo Clinic Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine’s 100th anniversary over the next 18 months.\n\nI am proud to announce that the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine will be celebrating the centennial anniversary of the department in April 2024. This date is based on the official designation on April 1, 1924, by the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors of the Section on Regional Anesthesia. The section was to evolve into our current Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. This Centennial Celebration will also recognize the 31 years of nurse anesthesia preceding the official recognition of the future department, the contributions of Mayo Clinic nurse anesthetists to the establishment of the field of nurse anesthesia, and the development of the specialty of anesthesiology, respiratory therapy and intensive care units at Mayo Clinic.\n\nWith the recruitment of John Lundy, M.D. from Seattle by Dr. William Mayo and Dr. Lundy’s start at Mayo Clinic on April 1, 1924, the new Section on Regional Anesthesia began what was to evolve progressively to the Section on Anesthesia, the Department of Anesthesiology, and now the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. Dr. Lundy quickly added innovative advances to the nascent specialty of anesthesiology, both internally at Mayo Clinic and nationally. As described by our colleagues Drs. Terry A. Ellis, Bradly J. Narr, and Douglas R. Bacon in a 2004 article in the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia, Dr. Lundy established the first anatomy lab at the Mayo Clinic. He believed that the lab would serve as a useful tool for teaching residents as well as research into regional anesthetic techniques. To advance the science of anesthesiology, Dr. Lundy developed the concept of balanced anesthesia, pioneered the introduction of barbiturates (e.g., pentothal) to the practice of anesthesia, and developed anesthesia section services for the use of ventilators, ventilator vests, oxygen tents, and nasal oxygen supplementation. Remarkably, in 1935 he also established the nation's first blood bank.\n\nFor the next year-and-a-half, the Centennial Project Team will be sending you short weekly emails, with each containing very brief descriptions of articles or vignettes that highlight the department’s development, remarkable personnel across the spectrum of the department (e.g., respiratory therapists, nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologists, scientists, and administrators), and contributions to the specialty’s advances and recognition. These emails will contain links to either the articles directly or to these stories on our new History of the Department of Anesthesiology website. The website will be available to everyone, both those within Mayo Clinic’s firewall and those outside of the institution. I promise that you will find many of the articles and stories to be quick reads, interesting, and often entertaining.\n\nFor this Introductory update, I’ve linked two published articles that showcase our founders, Dr. Lundy and Alice Magaw. I also have attached a pdf file of an article by Scott Atchison, written in our 2002 department newsletter, describing our good friend and long-time colleague, Dr. Rungson Sittipong. I believe you will enjoy reading them.\n\n“Alice Magaw (Kessel): Her Life In and Out of the Operating Room\" by Jeffrey E. Nelson, CRNA, MNA; Steve F. Wilstead, CRNA, MNA.

You will need to send me your name and contact information so that I can send out the card to the winner each week. Each person will be allowed a single win during the series of 80 updates during the Centennial Celebration’s 18 months.\n\nThis month’s mystery person, a remarkable leader:\n\nI’ll provide more information in the coming months as we near the start of the 100th anniversary and throughout the year of celebration. On behalf of the Centennial Project Team (listed below), we hope that you enjoy reading about the amazing colleagues who developed one of the world’s outstanding departments of anesthesiology.\n\nMayo Clinic employee photograph of John Silas Lundy, M.D., 1934.\n\nMayo Clinic, the American Board of Anesthesiology, and the Evolution of the Specialty\n\nIn a previous Update, we discussed the evolution of anesthesia at Mayo Clinic and the remarkable achievements of our earliest nurse anesthetists. The physician side of anesthesia developed more slowly, with modest advances during the first decades of the 20th century. Our own John Lundy and the University of Wisconsin’s Ralph Waters, a 1926 Mayo alumnus, were two of the leaders who spearheaded efforts to have anesthesiology recognized as an academic specialty. They pushed hard to develop certification in anesthesiology. Specifically, they were able to convince the American Board of Surgery to provide anesthesia certification in 1937. This led to the incorporation of the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) the next year as an affiliate of the American Board of Surgery. In 1941 the American Medical Association’s Council on Medical Education and the American Board of Medical Specialties approved the ABA as an independent certifying board. John Lundy’s influence with the American Medical Association provided the push to get final approval.\n\nLundy was appointed as one of the nine founding members of the ABA. For the next 18 years he influenced the ABA as it guided the fledgling specialty’s evolution, establishing norms for the certification of individual physicians and setting standards in education and research for anesthesiology training programs. What he lacked in political finesse in the ABA and national specialty societies, he made up for with a dominant personality and tenacity. He and Waters often disagreed on how the specialty should develop. The early ABA directors fell into two cliques: those linked to John Lundy and those linked to Ralph Waters. Lundy recruited a number of former Mayo trainees to become ABA directors. These included alumni Ralph Tovell, Charles McCuskey, Ed Tuohy, and Albert Faulconer. His efforts started a cascade of Mayo Clinic alumni who have served as directors of the ABA for 75 of the 85 years of its existence. No other department has provided more directors to the ABA. In addition, more than 100 department alumni from Rochester, Arizona, and Florida have served as examiners for the ABA or participated in the development of the ABA’s primary and subspecialty certifying examinations. The department’s sustained support for the academic development of the specialty and the certification processes of the ABA is astounding.\n\nWhy is Mayo Clinic’s continuous leadership in the ABA important? The ABA is one of the most influential organizations in U.S. anesthesiology because it determines the criteria for board certification. Training programs, through standards established by the Anesthesiology Review Committee of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), need to adapt to the criteria set by the ABA. As a consequence, much of the academic progress of the specialty is guided by the ABA.\n\nHere is a list of 11 Mayo Clinic directors of the ABA. Note that Mark Keegan currently is the ABA Treasurer (Mark T. Keegan, M.B., B.CH. - The American Board of Anesthesiology (theaba.org).\n\nJohn Lundy (1938-1955)\n\nRalph Tovell (1938-1949)\n\nCharles McCuskey (1940-1953)\n\nEdward Tuohy (1950-1955)\n\nAlbert Faulconer (1955-1969)\n\nRobert Patrick (1962-1974)\n\nRichard Theye (1969-1976)\n\nAlan Sessler (1977-1989)\n\nMark Warner (1998-2010)\n\nDavid Warner (2010-2022)\n\nMark Keegan (current)\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photo is Pauline Bisel.\n\nPauline is from Co. Meath, Ireland. She was one of twelve children and grew up in the country 30 miles north of Dublin. Following her elementary and secondary education she completed a two-year program on the care of children at St. Clare’s Dietetic Hospital in Co. Meath. On completion of this she worked for several years at St. Mary’s Hospital for children in Baldoyle, Dublin. Most of the patients were children who had post poliomyelitis complications.\n\nIn her early twenties she decided to become a Catholic nun joining a community in New York State involved in the care of the elderly. After two years in this endeavor she realized she could not spend her life living with all women! She returned home to Ireland and after a short while travelled to England where she attended the Chelmsford School of Nursing in Chelmsford, Essex. While there she met and married her husband Steve who was serving in the United States Air Force.\n\nUpon returning to the United States she worked for several years in various hospitals in different states gaining experience in multiple specialties including intensive care. During this time she and Steve were blessed with two daughters.\n\nIn 1979 Pauline applied to the Nurse Anesthetist program at Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, MN. As she drove to her interview in Rochester, she recalled first reading about Mayo Clinic in a book she discovered in her uncle’s house when she was 9 or 10 years old. At that time Mayo Clinic and Rochester, Minnesota were a very long distance away. The mere thought she could be there one day was absurd. At this interview she recalls meeting the esteemed Dr. Peter Southorn who impressed her with his warmth and sincerity.\n\nShe entered the Nurse Anesthetist program in September 1979 and upon graduating stayed on as staff anesthetist at St. Mary’s Hospital. The first two years were in Cardiac Anesthesia where she was very fortunate to be involved in pediatric cardiac anesthesia under the tutoring and mentoring of Drs Beynan and Raimundo. Pauline’s love for taking care of children was clearly met. In 1987 Dr. John McMichan invited her to join the anesthesia group going to Scottsdale, Arizona. It was a department of three MDs and one CRNA. This move created unique challenges. The local anesthesia providers were not welcoming CRNAs. However, over time and due to the excellent health care Mayo Clinic provided to the community acceptance was gained. Even though challenging this was also a very exciting time.\n\nAfter eleven years Pauline stepped down from administrative duties to be a full time clinical anesthetist. For several years she travelled to Mexico and Haiti with a small Mayo group who were part of International Medical Assistance. This was a very rewarding experience. Pauline retired in 2013 after thirty-two years on staff. In retirement she continues aiding her neighbors to the south by being part of a small group of Mayo Clinic Colleagues offering mobile medical clinics in Ensenada, Mexico.\n\nHere is this week’s Mystery Photo.\n\nGaston Labat, M.D., undated.\n\nOur Department of Anesthesiology Innovations: Gaston Labat and the Rise of Regional Anesthesia at the Mayo Clinic and Across the U.S.\n\nMayo Clinic was thriving in 1920 as the world rebounded from the impact of World War I. The Mayo brothers and their colleagues, including our nurse anesthetists, continued to produce excellent surgical outcomes. Their contributions of Mayo Clinic personnel, and their personal involvement, in the war had increased the Mayo reputation in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere around the world. However, Will and Charlie were never satisfied with the status quo; they wished for patient care to improve as medical practices evolved. To this end, they personally traveled across the U.S. and abroad to learn new surgical and diagnostic techniques and treatments. They also encouraged their colleagues to travel.\n\nWhile visiting Victor Pauchet, a well-known professor of surgery in Paris in 1920, Charlie observed the anesthesia performed by Gaston Labat. He was particularly impressed with Labat’s use of regional blocks and recognized the potential of regional anesthesia to improve muscle relaxation and operating conditions, especially for intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic procedures. Labat had worked for three years as a medical student at the University of Paris with Pauchet. Pauchet was a strong advocate for the use of regional anesthesia. In 1914, Pauchet had published the first edition of L’Anesthesie Regionale. A revised second edition followed in 1917. Charlie promptly invited Labat to Rochester to teach the Mayo surgeons how to administer regional anesthesia.\n\nOur own Doug Bacon provides an excellent summary (“Gaston Labat, John Lundy, Emery Rovenstine, and the Mayo Clinic: The spread of Regional Anesthesia in America Between the World Wars”) of Labat’s time in Rochester from September 1920 through October 1921 and the long-term positive impact of his Mayo connection on the growth of regional anesthesia in the U.S. During his stay, Labat produced his classic text, Regional Anesthesia: Its Technic and Clinical Application. It was published in 1922 after Labat had moved to New York City and was working at New York University and Bellevue Hospitals. His advocacy and the textbook led to the increase in enthusiasm for and use of regional anesthesia in the U.S. and elsewhere. His text was revised into a 2nd edition in 1928. Labat became a strong advocate for regional anesthesia and was a founding member of the original American Society of Regional Anesthesia.\n\nLabat’s regional anesthesia textbook created controversy of its own as it was very similar to the earlier Pauchet text. Our own Annie Côté, Claude Vachon, Terre Horlocker, and Doug Bacon describe this controversy, with Labat never crediting Pauchet in their 2003 article titled “From Victor Pauchet to Gaston Labat: The Transformation of Regional Anesthesia from a Surgeon’s Practice to the Physician Anesthesiologist”. Mystery arises with Labat’s death in 1934 and the apparent “loss” of a third edition of the text, described by our own Claude Vachon, Doug Bacon, and Steve Rose in their 2008 article titled “Gaston Labat’s Regional Anesthesia: The Missing Years”.\n\nSimply put, Labat was the primary catalyst for the rise of regional anesthesia in the U.S. His advocacy and textbook led to several generations of anesthesia leaders (e.g., Lundy, Ralph Waters, and Emory Rovenstine) who carried the enthusiasm for the use of regional anesthesia forward and across the country.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photo is Florence McQuillan, CRNA.\n\nAs described by the AANA (Profiles of Nurse Anesthetists/Nurse Anesthesiologists - AANA - American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology), she was born in 1903 in Mahtowa, Minnesota (25 miles SW of Duluth) and graduated from the Central School of Nursing at the University of Minnesota in 1925. She received her anesthesia education at the Minneapolis General Hospital in 1926. John Lundy invited Florence to join his staff at the Mayo Clinic in 1927. She worked closely with Lundy as chief nurse anesthetist, cared for the patients of the Mayo brothers, and served as a clinical instructor for new nurse anesthetists.\n\nIn 1936, Lundy asked Florence and Dr. Lloyd Mousel, a new resident, to select papers for presentation at a staff, resident, and nurse anesthetist journal club. Attendees were initially asked to review the papers and prepare reports for the journal club, an additional task that they resented. Within a year, Florence suggested to Lundy that an abstract for each paper be prepared by either her or our Mayo Section on Publications to reduce the burden on the attendees. This proved popular and in 1937 Lundy and Florence began publishing these abstracts in a new format, Anesthesia Abstracts. The journal Anesthesia Abstracts was produced from 1937 through 1966 and was widely read. It’s successor publication, Survey in Anesthesiology, was published through 2017. Florence also prepared abstracts for the fledgling Anesthesiology from 1940 through 1947.\n\nIn 1948 Florence resigned from Mayo Clinic and became the first AANA Executive Director (formerly Executive Secretary), a position she held until her retirement in 1970. In her 22 years as Executive Director, she was influential in virtually all areas of the AANA’s growth and expansion. Under her guidance, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare officially recognized the AANA’s authority to grant accreditation for nurse anesthesia programs and to grant certification for nurse anesthetists/nurse anesthesiologists. She also instituted the AANA’s voluntary continuing education program, which made the AANA the first professional nursing organization to recognize the need for continuing professional education; this eventually led to the adoption of a mandatory CE program. Florence received the AANA Award of Appreciation in 1970 and the Agatha Hodgins Award of Outstanding Accomplishment in 1981.\n\nAn excellent summary of her career can be found at Florence McQuillen (1903–1981), “Benevolent Dictator” of Nurse Anesthetists - Working Nurse.\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Kelsey Nelsen.\n\nHere is this week’s Mystery Photo.\n\nPlease email your response at warner.mark@mayo.edu within 3 days of this update.

John Lundy and Charles Adams, the first two chairs of our department in 1924-1952 and 1952-1953, respectively, worked closely throughout their careers. Both had a strong interest in improving patient care and safety. Adams joined the department as a fellow in 1935, the same year that Lundy established the country’s first hospital blood bank and used refrigerated, citrated blood. One of their common interests was preoperative anemia and its potential impact on the outcomes of surgical patients. Based on their clinical observations, they published a 1942 article in the Journal of Surgery, Gynecology, and Obstetrics (now known as the Journal of the American College of Surgeons) and highlighted the importance of transfusing blood when the preoperative hemoglobin was less than 8 to 10 grams per cubic centimeter of whole blood. Lundy also advocated for preoperative transfusions for anemia in his classic 1942 textbook, Clinical Anesthesia: A Manual of Clinical Anesthesiology (pages 380-381).\n\nAs with many new ideas, there was controversy around the issue of transfusion triggers. For example, Myhre noted in his work, “Clinical Commentary: The Transfusion Trigger-the Search for a Quantitative Holy Grail”, that Lundy and Adams presented no data upon which to base their recommendation. Nonetheless, their strong advocacy and, especially, Mayo Clinic and Lundy’s national visibility and credibility led to the general spread of using transfusion triggers in preoperative assessment of surgical patients. Lundy was particularly influential as his textbook became the official source for information used in the 90-day anesthesia training programs for physicians in WWII. Many of these physicians would become leaders of the specialty during the decades that followed the war.\n\nInterestingly, our department continues to lead the country in evaluating and treating preoperative anemia. Drs. DJ Kor and Matt Warner currently oversee a large clinical research effort that includes many of our colleagues to evaluate and implement perioperative patient blood management strategies. Examples from their work have been published extensively this past year in journals such as JAMA, Annuals of Surgery, Anesthesia and Analgesia, and the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photo is Bob Chantigian, M.D.\n\nBob was born in Philadelphia in 1951 and attended Temple University. Not content to be a typical college student, he was engaged in the university for a decade and graduated with not one but three degrees (B.A. in Mathematics, B.S. in Pharmacy, and M.D.). He came to Mayo in Rochester for his residency training in 1979, joining an incoming group of new residents that included Steve Rettke, Mary Ellen Warner, and Mark Warner. Amazingly, these four individuals have spent a cumulative 165 years in the department. By the time you read this Update, Bob will have retired as his last work day as a consultant is Wednesday, February 14th, a Valentine’s Day that many of us will associate with Bob’s retirement date.\n\nAfter completing his residency program, Bob trained in obstetric anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and then in pediatric anesthesia at Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He joined the staff of Brigham and Women’s Department of Anesthesiology from 1983 through mid-1985 before returning to Rochester. Upon his return he became the department’s Director of Obstetric Anesthesia, serving in that capacity for 10 years and remaining a mainstay in that area for two decades.\n\nBob is a remarkable teacher and clinician. He has been awarded 10 Teacher of the Year Awards from the residents and student nurse anesthetists and is a member of the Mayo Fellows Association Teaching Hall of Fame. In 2013, the department recognized him with its Commitment to Education Award. He also earned Distinguished Clinician Awards from residents and colleagues.\n\nIn 1992 Brian Hall and Tony Jones wrote the first edition of their best-selling board examination preparation book, Anesthesia: A Comprehensive Review. They published a 2nd edition in 1997 before Tony left Mayo to become chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. With Tony’s move, Bob joined Brian in producing editions 3 through 6 in 2003, 2010, 2015, and 2019, respectively. Their text is one of the best-selling in the U.S. over three decades and has become an anesthesia library staple. They currently are working on the book’s 7th revision. They believe it will be available at the end of this year.\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Monica Green.\n\nHere is this week’s Mystery Photo.\n\nPlease email your response at warner.mark@mayo.edu within 3 days of this update.

Frost, M.D., undated.\n\nRemarkable Educators: This Week’s Feature on Dr. Ron Faust\n\nThe department, institution-wide, has been blessed with outstanding educators and leaders during its first 100 years. In the coming months, we’ll highlight a number of those leaders. These will include anesthesiologists who have led national and internal graduate medical education schools and initiatives (e.g., Alan Sessler, Mark Warner, and Steve Rose in their roles as Dean, Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education); nurse anesthetists who have been legendary leaders in education, program directors, and the nurse anesthesia program’s medical directors (e.g., Alice Magaw, Florence McQuillen, Ed Thompson, Bob Johnson, Mary Marienau, Erin Martin; Virginia Hartridge, and Beth Elliott); and anesthesiology residency program directors (e.g., Alan Sessler, Ron Faust, Leslie Milde, Steve Rose, Tim Long, Renee Caswell, Marie DeRuyter, and others).\n\nThis week we are featuring Dr. Ron Faust. For those who were residents in my generation, Ron was an outstanding program director and wonderful colleague. Ron was the son of a New Orleans anesthesiologist. He attended the Louisiana State University Medical School, graduating in 1969. What was to follow for the next four years is best described by Ron:\n\n“I signed up with the Navy while a student at LSU Medical School in New Orleans in the class of 1969. My father, a physician, had signed up with the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked. An older brother of mine, an attorney in the Navy, was on a carrier in the late ’60’s.\n\nActive duty for me started July 1970 at the end of my rotating internship at Charity Hospital. When my orders came, I was very surprised to read that I would be going to the 1st Marine Division; they were in Vietnam. The Navy Medical Corps provided all medical support to the Marine Corps. By July 26, 1970, I was on the ground as a ”Battalion Surgeon” in the 1st Marine Division in what was to later become South Vietnam. The area was still a combat zone and my Battalion Aid Station consisted of two small rooms under sandbags near the village of An Hoa. This was a rural base about 30 miles south of Da Nang. When a big Battalion operation was in progress, I would rotate out to camp on a hilltop called “371” in support of the Battalion Command. My tour of duty in that country ended in late March 1971.\n\nFor my second year of active duty, I served at Oakland Naval Hospital as a general medical officer in their out-patient “drop in” clinic. We saw Navy personnel and their family members. I completed my second year of active duty there in June 1972.\n\nAdvancing into inactive Naval Reserve, I returned to Charity Hospital in New Orleans that summer. I started first-year residency in general surgery on the LSU service. A year later I ‘saw the light’ and transferred to anesthesia residency at Mayo in July 1973.”\n\nRon worked clinically primarily in our Division of Neuroanesthesiology with colleagues such as Jack Michenfelder, Joe Messick, Roy Cucchiara, Leslie Milde, Bill Lanier, Don Muzzi, Tom Lasasso, Margaret Weglinski, Bill Perkins, and others. He dedicated much of his attention to our residency program. During his time as program director, 248 residents and fellows trained in our programs and the annual number of residents grew from 26 to 62. Ron was a national leader in anesthesiology education and served as president of the Society for Education in Anesthesia in 1991-1992. His book, Anesthesiology Review, is one of the specialty’s most successful and widely read texts. It was initially published in 1991; the 6th edition is now entitled, Faust’s Anesthesiology Review, with Editor-In-Chief Dr. Terry Trentman, former chair of our department in Mayo Clinic Arizona. More than 100 department members have contributed chapters to the series of the book’s editions.\n\nIn recognition of his outstanding contributions to education at Mayo Clinic, Ron was recognized with Mayo Clinic’s Distinguished Educator Award in 2000. Others in the department who have earned that recognition are:\n\n2000: Ron Faust\n\n2009: Beth Elliott\n\n2015: Renee Caswell\n\n2017: Mark Warner\n\n2022: Beth Ladlie\n\n2022: Steve Rose\n\nRon has a passion for cars. He wrote an article describing this passion for Peter Southorn in our May 2026 department newsletter titled “My Automotive Avocation May 2006”. Ron and his wife, Claire, have two daughters and a son. His son, Jonathan, is an anesthesiologist alumni of our department and currently practices in the Twin Cities area.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photo is Gary Sieck, Ph.D.\n\nGary was born in Seward, Nebraska, and together with his twin brother Jerry, they were the first in the family to attend college. Gary is a University of Nebraska Corn Husker through and through, earning his undergraduate degree in Lincoln and PhD in Physiology & Biophysics in Omaha. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the UCLA Brain Research Institute, Gary was appointed to the faculty in the Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology at UCLA and the Department of Pulmonary Medicine at City of Hope Medical Center. In 1987, Gary transitioned to the faculty in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California.\n\nHe finally saw the light and returned to the Midwest, coming to Rochester in 1990 and joining our department as well as the Mayo Clinic’s Department of Physiology & Biomedical Engineering. From 1991-2002, Gary served as our Vice-Chair for Research. In 2002, he became Chair of the Department of Physiology & Biomedical Engineering, serving in that role until 2014.\n\nGary’s research focuses on cardiopulmonary physiology with an emphasis on neural control of breathing muscles. His research has been continuously funded by NIH grants since 1976. He has published extensively. Throughout his career, Gary has been incredibly active in education and mentorship. He has mentored more than 350 students and fellows. Many of his trainees have gone on to successful careers in biomedical research. In fact, two of his former PhD trainees are currently department chairs in our institution, Y.S. Prakash in Physiology & Biomedical Engineering and Carlos Mantilla in, of course, Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine.\n\nGary has received numerous honors for his research accomplishments, including recognition as a named professor and a Distinguished Mayo Investigator. Outside of Mayo, he has received the Rodarte Award for Scientific Distinction from the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Chairs of Departments of Physiology (ACDP), the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the Distinguished Advocate Award from the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).\n\nHe has served as a member of the ATS Board of Directors, a member of the National Council of the American Lung Association, President of the American Physiological Society (APS) and President of the Association of Chairs of Departments of Physiology. He is currently a member of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS). In his spare time (ha!), Gary has served as Editor-in-Chief of both the Journal of Applied Physiology and of Physiology.\n\nHere is this week’s Mystery Photo.\n\nPlease email your response at warner.mark@mayo.edu within 3 days of this update.

Belatti, M.D., undated\n\nSioux Falls, South Dakota: “Mayo Clinic West” in Anesthesiology\n\nDr. William Mayo was occasionally asked if he regretted making education such an important part of Mayo Clinic. For most of us who trained at Mayo, the question seems odd, and we ponder why anyone would have asked it. Education has always played an important role at Mayo Clinic. In fact, the Mayo brothers believed so strongly in the training of the next generation of health care providers that they donated a fair portion of their wealth to an endowment that sustains our educational programs even today. It turns out that people asked Will this question because they couldn’t understand why he and Charlie would train their future competitors. For the brothers, was not an issue that concerned them. They believed that many patients did not have access to excellent care and, therefore, they should help increase the quantity and quality of health care providers.\n\nTheir education initiatives extended beyond the training of new physicians. They consistently evaluated their practices, envisioned the types of health care providers that would be needed in the future, and created educational programs to train them. Examples of the health care fields that they started are nurse anesthesia, physical therapy, surgical assistants and technicians, and histology assistants. Their successors continued by developing the country’s first training programs for cardiac perfusionists, electro-neurodiagnostic technicians, and echocardiographic technicians. All in all, an impressive set of innovative new health care provider fields.\n\nIn many training programs, graduates leave our sites and go on to establish strong departments and groups elsewhere. Recognizing the quality of training that they received at Mayo, they subsequently reach back to our institutional programs and seek to recruit additional graduates to join them. These recruitment “pipelines” exist for many of our educational programs. Our best example in Rochester may be the pipeline of recruitment that led to anesthesia practices in Sioux Falls, South Dakota being labeled as “Mayo Clinic West.”\n\nIn 1979, Dr. Richard “Dick” Belatti completed his training in Rochester and moved to Sioux Falls where he joined Dr. Ed Daw, a 1960 graduate of our anesthesiology residency program, at Sioux Valley Hospital. Starting in 1983, Dick recruited Bill Horner (1983) to join him . . . and a cascade of Rochester anesthesiology resident graduates followed. Over time, a few of our graduates joined the anesthesia practice at McKennan Hospital (now Avera McKennan), the second Sioux Falls Hospital, and by 1995, more than 90% of the anesthesiologists in Sioux Falls were Mayo graduates. Today, 36 Mayo residency graduates have either worked or are now working in the anesthesiology practices of Sioux Falls. These include:\n\nSioux Valley Hospital (now part of Sanford Health)\n\nEd Daw\n\nDick Belatti\n\nBill Horner\n\nLes Steidl\n\nGary Halma\n\nDoug Bell\n\nScott Atchison\n\nSteve Kunkel\n\nArne Sorenson\n\nTom Christopherson\n\nKevin Ronan\n\nRJ Lunn\n\nJack Gaspari\n\nBob Grady\n\nMac Sanders\n\nMike Johnson\n\nGreg Hieb\n\nBarry Hein\n\nCasey Husser\n\nMarshall Holifield\n\nSteph Knight\n\nLoc Nguyen\n\nBrady Stocklin\n\nMatt Ulrich\n\nRyan Rowberry\n\nSeri Carney\n\nDan Thum\n\nKelly Doolittle\n\nAvera McKennan Hospital\n\nJohn Gray\n\nScott Lockwood\n\nDavid Munce\n\nDean Dewald\n\nJoel Farmer\n\nDusty Thorpe\n\nMatt Naatjes\n\nAndy Mortensen\n\nEmily Fowler\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photo is Dr. Tim Lamer.\n\nTim was born and raised in a small paper mill town in north central Wisconsin. After college and medical school at the University of Wisconsin, he moved to Rochester in 1983 to start our residency training program. He completed his residency as well as a Pain Medicine fellowship in Rochester and has been in the department ever since. He first split his time between the Pain Medicine Clinic and the operating rooms in Rochester. In 1991, Dr. Jim Harper recruited Tim to move to Jacksonville and help develop our Mayo Clinic Florida Pain Medicine practice and a fellowship program.\n\nTim was a leader in our Florida department during his 16 years in Jacksonville, starting as chair of the Pain Medicine Division and Director of the Pain Medicine fellowship program. In 1997 at the conclusion of Jim Harper’s term as department chair, Tim stepped into that role and served as chair until 2001. During that time period, Tim led the integration of the St. Luke’s private practice anesthesiology group into the Mayo department, opened an outpatient surgical center, and started what is now one of the country’s largest and most successful liver transplant anesthesia teams. He subsequently dedicated his remaining time in Jacksonville to the growth of our pain medicine practice, expansion of our fellowship program, and study of innovative techniques in pain medicine. The Pain Medicine Division became the Department of Pain Medicine in 2004 with Tim as its chair.\n\nIn 2007, Tim returned to Rochester and has dedicated his professional efforts to Pain Medicine both internally and externally. Tim has served on the editorial boards of Pain Medicine, the Pain Physician, and Clinical Journal of Pain. For the former, he is the current Section Editor on Neuromodulation and Minimally Invasive Surgery. He is a past president (2019-2020) of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. In addition, Tim has received numerous Teacher of the Year awards and was recognized in 1990 as our Rochester department’s Distinguished Clinician.\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Michelle Ewy.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.

It remained a major educational text in the specialty for three decades. However, it was not without controversy as his writing was based primarily on his observations in clinical practice. It was not well-referenced and contained ideas that were not universally accepted. In the excerpt below, Doug Bacon has summarized the textbook, its controversies, and its important value to the men and women who shouldered much of the anesthesia care in war zones and elsewhere during World War II.\n\nIn the late 1930s there was a clear need for an updated, “modern,” comprehensive textbook of anesthesiology. In discussion between Anaesthetists’ Travel Club members Drs. Emery A. Rovenstine and Arthur Guedel, the need was clearly acknowledged. The dilemma was over who would write such a book. Guedel was concerned that he was too old and out of touch. His good friend Dr. Ralph Waters, whose department at the University of Wisconsin could surely produce a “cutting edge” tome, had neither the time nor the interest to write. Guedel urged Rovenstine, the driving force behind academic physician anesthesia in New York City to write it. Emery demurred, procrastinated and when he was starting to compose the book, W. B. Saunders published Clinical Anesthesia. John Lundy had “scooped them all.” Did Lundy know of Guedel and Rovenstine’s plans? Was there discussion about a textbook at the Travel Club Meetings in Rochester, Minnesota (1938), New York City (1939) or Boston (1940)? What part did the conflict in Europe and eventually the world play in Lundy’s decision to write?\n\nThe 1942 publication is fascinating. The forward is written by William J. Mayo, M.D. who died in July 28, 1939. Thus, the book had to be well underway in 1938 or early 1939. Dr. Mayo writes, “In this book, Dr. Lundy presents in a practical form the place of anesthesia in modern surgery.” Realizing that the reader would know that Dr. Mayo had died, Lundy inserted a small footnote, “Dr. Mayo was much interested in preparation of the manuscript of this book. He wrote the forward after one of the many conversations with the author.” In the preface Lundy describes his method for creating the book, basing it largely on clinical cases. He built in redundancy so that busy military physicians could easily find the necessary material without consulting the index.\n\nAs the 90-day courses for physicians in anesthesiology rolled out during World War II, Clinical Anesthesia was touted as the textbook to study. Clearly clinically-aimed without considerable theoretical discussions, the book was comprehensive enough for the novice. Regional anesthesia was extensively covered, an inclusion that proved to be a lifesaver in combat anesthesia. But at 771 pages, it might well have been difficult to transport for physicians near the front.\n\nPerhaps the March 1943 review of the book in Anesthesiology by editor-in chief and fellow Travel Club member Dr. Henry Ruth best sums the book’s importance. It is remarkable for its polite but valid notations of potential controversial statements in the textbook, which Henry S. Ruth, M.D., comments on in a book review. He noted that Clinical Anesthesia was essentially a unique compilation of the personal experiences of a clinician with a wide and varied practice. Ruth also noted that there were few illustrations and references. Thus, the book was not structured or written in the format of the modern academic textbook. It never had a second edition and had one post-war second printing.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Burdette (Bud) Polk, CRNA and John T. (Tom) Martin, M.D.\n\nBud Polk was our first nurse anesthesia supervisor in Jacksonville when he moved from Rochester in 1986. Bud was born in Independence, Iowa. He completed his nurse anesthesia training in Rochester in 1968. After one year working in LaCrosse, Wisconsin at Gunderson Lutheran Hospital, he was recruited back to Rochester by Dr. Emerson Moffitt, chair of our Division of Cardiac Anesthesia. He served as the supervisor for our cardiac practice, working closely with Emerson and others in the operating rooms and on research projects. Things were soon to change for Bud, though.\n\nOur intensive care units (St. Marys Hospital and Rochester Methodist Hospital ICUs) were established in 1966 by Dr. Albert Falconer (chair of the department from 1955-1969). Dr. Paul Didier, with Renee Caspersen, CRNA, developed the Methodist Hospital ICU and Dr. Alan Sessler, with Bernie Gilles, CRNA, developed the St. Marys Hospital ICU. Bud joined the expanding Section on Intensive Care in 1972 as the new supervisor of our intensive care services at RMH. Other key members supporting the growing number of intensivists and critically ill patients included Myron Ricks, CRNA (1970), Lester Clapp, RT (1971), and Tom Holtackers, PT (1972).\n\nIn 1982, Bud transitioned back to the operating rooms, working closely with Steve Schmidt. Four years later, he decided to move to Jacksonville. He was joined by colleagues Drs. Jim Harper and Tim Shine and nurse anesthetists Linda Buck, Alicia Cassabar, and Phil Klineschmidt. These six individuals provided the anesthesia care for the Mayo Clinic patients who were receiving their care at St. Luke’s Hospital in south Jacksonville. They were joined by others in 1987 and, by 1988, they were appointed as a group to be the Department of Anesthesiology at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville. Jim Harper served as the department’s first chair. Parenthetically, the department cooperatively worked with the pre-existing private practice anesthesia group at St. Luke’s Hospital for a decade until the department took over full provision of anesthesia services for all patients in 1996. Bud served as the supervisor for the new department during its first 5 years before Linda Buck, CRNA succeeded him in the role in 1991. From 1991 through 2003, Bud provided care for cardiac patients and joined the nascent liver transplant service.\n\nBud retired in 2003 and lives today in Palm Coast, Florida. Palm Coast has 26 miles of saltwater canals connecting to the ocean, fitting Bud’s love for boating. In fact, he was a yacht broker for a period of time after his anesthesia career.\n\nTom Martin was the first mentor that Mary Ellen and I had when he was chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo. It was Tom who sent us to Rochester for our ASA Medical Student Preceptorships in 1978 and introduced us to Drs. Alan Sessler, Duane Rorie, Jim Prentice, Ted Janossy, Mark Sperry, Gary Baggenstoss, Charley Rich, and so many others great anesthesiologists and residents. Ann Brumm, Jane Post, and Donna Baxter worked in the department offices at that time and made sure we knew how to get to our daily assignments. In those assignments, nurse anesthetists such as Alice Johnson, Jeanne Tiemans, John Carter, Mary Marienau, Jack Hostak, and others graciously tolerated our ineptitude and lack of knowledge and taught us how anesthesia care was provided at Mayo Clinic.\n\nTom was born in Cleveland, Ohio but grew up primarily in the Cincinnati area. His mother, Clara Martin, worked at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and started the student boarding system and food services in that institution. Today, Martin Hall is one of the university’s primary dining halls and one that I used my first year at Miami. Tom met Marion, his wife of 59 years, in high school and they became a dynamic couple on the music scene during their time in Rochester (1958-1972). Marion was a master pianist and Tom was extraordinary as a trombonist. Tom was a member of the Mayo Clinic Notochords stage band, the Rochester Symphany Orchestra, and the Rochester Park Band. He also served as president of the Rochester Civic Music organization.\n\nTom was drafted into the military in 1944 and was the first graduating US. Air Force anesthesiology resident at Lackland Air Force Base (Wilford Hall) in 1948. Tom served as the Air Force’s residency program’s director until moving in 1958 to Rochester to join our department. He was the division chair downtown when the Rochester Methodist Hospital was being built and designed many of the elements in the hospital’s new operating rooms. The hospital opened in 1966. In 1972, Tom moved to New Orleans as chair of the Ochsner Clinic’s Department of Anesthesiology. After a short 2-year stint in that role, he moved to the Medical College of Ohio (MCO), joining Dr. Lucien Morris and colleagues. At MCO, he succeeded Dr. Morris as chair, served as medical director of intensive care and president of the MCO Faculty Senate.\n\nTom gained international recognition for his reports, presentations, and book dedicated to patient positioning. His text, “Positioning in Anesthesia,” was the primary authority of patient positioning during surgical procedures for more than 3 decades. Tom also was very involved in pre-hospital care training. He was the medical director of the northwest Ohio emergency medical technician program and paramedic training. He continued our department’s leadership of the International Anesthesia Research Society by serving as president of its Board of Trustees from 1979-1981. He was an editor of Anesthesia & Analgesia from 1966-1977. Tom passed away in 2005 in Toledo, Ohio. I was honored to speak at his funeral.\n\nMystery Photo Contest Winner\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Tom Murphy.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.\n\nReminder: We are now featuring two individuals each week for the Updates.

In 1993, the Hiliary Clinton-led “Task Force on National Health Care Reform,” advocated strongly for managed care models. Although the Clinton Health Care Reform recommendations ultimately failed to advance through Congress, the task force’s advocacy for managed care increased enthusiasm for this model of care. Managed care models in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul led to many mergers of independent providers into rapidly growing health care systems such as Allina Health and Health Partners. This consolidation of practices and limitations on patients who wished to get their health care outside of their health systems restricted patient choice in the Minnesota market and raised the specter of reduced Rochester visits from Minnesota patients. In addition, the Clinton Health Care Reform proposed barriers between states, potentially reducing inter-state competition, an action that would have negatively impacted the number of potential patients who could travel to Rochester by choice.\n\nIn response, Mayo Clinic formed its own health system in 1992, initially called the Mayo Health System. The name changed in 2011 to its current Mayo Clinic Health System. I had the privilege of serving on the initial institutional committee that considered opportunities to secure our Midwest future by forming our own health care system. Led by Dr. Michael O’Sullivan (Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology), the committee discussed which hospitals and practices within 150 mile radius of Rochester might best augment our Mayo missions, benefit from Mayo Clinic support and resources, and protect our referral interests. I specifically mention our Mayo missions as our clinical schools (i.e., medical school, graduate medical education school, and health sciences school) were growing and more clinical experiences were needed for the increased number of trainees. A summary of the growth of the Mayo Clinic Health System can be found at Mayo Clinic Health System - Wikipedia and in a Mayo Clinic Proceedings article from 2003.\n\nThere initially was no mandate or even encouragement for hospital-based departments such as anesthesiology and radiology to engage with our growing new partners in the health system. However, over time our department began providing support for our anesthesia colleagues in Austin, Albert Lea, Red Wing, and other sites. Our electronic ICU practice started to provide services across the system. Preferential referrals for pain medicine followed. In February 2014, Dr. Brad Narr created a Division of Community Anesthesiology within the department. Dr. Jim Hebl was appointed as chair of the division and Marlea Judd, CRNA was appointed as the division’s nurse anesthesia director. Mirroring the overall health system, the Division of Community Anesthesiology organized into 4 regions.\n\nThe Northwest Wisconsin Region was overseen by Dr. Richard Belmont and Gram Cotton, CRNA\n\nThe Southwest Wisconsin Region was overseen by Dr. Peter Schams and Michael (Jake) Jacobson, CRNA\n\nThe Southeast Minnesota Region was overseen by Dr. Jennifer Goins; Ryan Sportel, CRNA (River Corridor) and Alice Schrad, CRNA (I-90 Corridor)\n\nThe Southwest Minnesota Region was overseen by Dr. Tim Murray and Steve Ydstie, CRNA\n\nThe Division of Community Anesthesiology was initially comprised of 46 anesthesiologist and 108 nurse anesthetists. The division sought to evolve to implement a single operational and strategic structure that would align with the remainder of the institution-wide Department of Anesthesiology, including major initiatives and clinical protocols involving quality and patient safety and outcomes. Integration was a major challenge at times. As one example, in 2015/2016, we had 18 unique paper anesthesia records in the health system sites as we sought to transition to a single electronic record system.\n\nDr. Sandy Kopp succeeded Jim Hebl as division chair in 2015. Jim became the Regional Vice-President of the Southwestern Region of the overall health system and is based in Mankato. Today, the division has 66 anesthesiologists and 129 nurse anesthetists. An additional 9 anesthesiologists in Rochester support the community practices. Dr. Jim Ottevaere of Eau Claire currently chairs the division. Darlene Bannon, CRNA, becomes the division’s CRNA director this month.\n\nThe anesthesiology sites in the health system create many opportunities for educating our many trainees. All four regions train student nurse anesthetists from our Rochester and LaCrosse programs. Mankato and Eau Claire have resident rotations at this time. Most of our sites teach paramedic and EMT students from local community schools as well as nurse practitioner and physician assistant students. Without our sites in the Mayo Clinic Health System, we would fall short of our educational needs in our Rochester anesthesiology residency and two nurse anesthesia training programs. All of our division anesthesiologists and CRNA leaders hold academic rank in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science.\n\nThe 2014 leadership of the Department of Anesthesiology in Rochester and its Division of Community Anesthesiology: Brad Narr, department chair; Natalie Caine, department administrator; Jim Hebl, division chair; and Marlea Judd, CRNA director.\n\nThe 2024 leadership of the Department of Anesthesiology in Rochester and its Division of Community Anesthesiology: Dr. Carlos Mantilla, department chair; Pam Bowman, department administrator; Jim Ottevaere, division chair; and Darlene Bannon, CRNA director.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Steve Rose, M.D. and Karen Hammell.\n\nSteve Rose was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. He graduated from “the most prestigious public high school” in Valley City, North Dakota (population 6,000+). Our own Drs. Niki Dietz and Kami Anderson are also graduates of Valley City High School. Steve moved on to Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota and Mayo Medical School before completing his anesthesiology residency at Mayo Clinic. With help from Dr. Martin Abel, Steve spent a year as a Senior Registrar at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa and several months in London, England as a Mayo Foundation Scholar before joining the Mayo faculty in 1985.\n\nSteve was an outstanding athlete in high school, a talent that paid dividends during his training. He played as an all-star on various intramural, departmental, and community flag football and broomball teams. In one of the most shining successes in his training, he resuscitated a fellow broomball player from a cardiac arrest on the ice. Today, he and his wife, Dr. Beth Elliott, continue to participate in sports as avid, expert downhill skiers and frequent swimmers.\n\nThe focus of Steve’s non-clinical career has been medical education. He served as residency program director from 1994-2007 and as the department’s Vice Chair for Education from 1994-2009. He was the Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education’s (MCSGME’s) Associate Dean for Surgery and Surgical Specialties from 2003-2009; Vice Dean from 2007-2012; and Dean from 2012-2021. He also was the school’s Designated Institutional Official (DIO) from 2007-2022. As DIO, he oversaw and governed nearly 200 accredited residency and fellowship programs that trained more than 1,900 residents and fellows annually.\n\nSteve was appointed to the national Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education’s (ACGME’s) Institutional Review Committee in 2017 as served as its chair from 2020-2023. This is one of the country’s most important leadership roles in graduate medical education. He is the first Mayo physician to serve in the role since an earlier version of it was established by Dr. Louis Wilson, one of Mayo Clinic’s pioneers in pathology and education. In 2022, Steve received two of the highest honors for a physician in education, the Mayo Clinic Distinguished Educator Award and the ASA’s Excellence in Education Award. This article summarizes his many educational accomplishments.\n\nThree of six MCSGME Deans have been members of the Department of Anesthesiology. Dr. Alan D. Sessler was the inaugural Dean. He served as a mentor to Dr. Mark A. Warner and to Steve (the second and third department members, respectively, to serve in this position).\n\nIn clinical practice, Steve works in our Central Division at St. Marys Hospital, caring for patients undergoing complex orthopedic, spine, and thoracic procedures.\n\nKaren Hammell was born in Rochester and attended school in Chatfield. After completing studies as an administrative secretary, Karen joined Mayo Clinic, working with the Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education (MCSGME) for 5 years. She subsequently worked within our institution’s Legal Department before joining our department in 1991 as the Education Program Coordinator for our residency. Her program director partners during her 31 years of stellar time as the residency coordinator have been Drs. Leslie Milde, Steve Rose, Tim Long, and Bridget Pulos.\n\nKaren has been a primary contact for our trainees during her three decades with the residency program in Rochester. She’s been remarkably successful and respected. She was recognized in 2017 with the MCSGME Education Program Coordinator Award in Surgery and Surgical Specialties, the institution’s highest recognition for that position. In 2023, she was recognized by the Mayo Fellows Association with its Fellow Award. The award is given to exceptional individuals who are extraordinarily committed to our residency and fellowship programs and their success.\n\nKaren will retire in June this year after more than 3 decades of service to our residency program in Rochester. She has 7 grandkids in the St. Charles and Plainview areas who will benefit from her new-found time. Best wishes, Karen!\n\nMystery Photo Contest Winner\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Karen Nase.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.

David Byer and Kelly McQueen. In this Update, Anesthesiology alumni Gary Boeke (1983) and Phil Boyle (1984), as well as Plastic Surgery alumnus Paul Schultz (1985), provide a summary of their efforts and many other Mayo physicians, nurse anesthetists, and operating room personnel in Guatemala for more than the last three decades. As a department, we are blessed that many of our colleagues are involved in humanitarian medical efforts. This summary provides an excellent example of many of our alumni and staff coming together in a sustained effort to help others.\n\n“Guatemala is a beautiful country known as the “Land of Eternal Spring.” The indigenous Mayan people have a rich heritage. From 1960 until the peace accord in 1996, Guatemala was embroiled in a civil war. As a result of war and poverty, HELPS International was organized as a relief/development organization dedicated to assisting the indigenous population. An integral part of this effort has been to bring medical-surgical teams to the needy.\n\nCentral Minnesota was the first HELPS medical team to volunteer in Guatemala in 1988 and 1989. Mayo alumni on those teams were Drs. Gary Boeke (Anesthesiology 1983), Philip Boyle (Anesthesiology 1984), Paul Schultz (Plastic Surgery 1985), Paul Heath (Plastic Surgery 1983) and James Smith (Plastic Surgery 1983). Subsequently, other medical teams were established over the years from around the US. For the year 2024 there are 9 medical teams scheduled to serve. The original 1988 team only had 7 volunteers; several of the current teams have 80-90 volunteers. The teams and the care they provide are self-funded. Central Minnesota has continued to field 2 teams per year for the last 36 years. Most medical teams provide 3-4 surgical sites along with medical clinic and dental staffing. The most frequent operations performed are hernia repairs, cleft lip and palate repairs, cholecystectomies, burn scar revisions, and gynecological surgeries. Ophthalmological services may also be provided when available. Lack of basic medical care in Guatemala makes for challenging cases. Most teams perform 130-180 surgical cases during their trips.\n\nOther Mayo Clinic alumni have volunteered and continue to serve on HELPS teams over the 36 years of the program. They include Drs. Tom Spackman (Anesthesiology 1980), Jack Bagby (Anesthesiology 1983), Chris Martin (Anesthesiology 1994, Pain Medicine 1996), Dick Olson (Anesthesiology 1984), John Gray (Anesthesiology 1984) Matt Ritter (Anesthesiology 2005, Critical Care Medicine 2006), Chris Schmidt (Surgery 1992) and Mike Sarr (GI Surgery, 1980). Mayo volunteer nurse anesthetists include Lori Bennet, Jill Hardy, Tera (Cox) Wenzel, and Cathy Cook. Several Mayo Clinic nurses and OR technicians have also joined the teams.\n\nHELPS is also involved with community development. This involves providing stoves (over 300,000 installed), a corn micro-loan program, water filters and educational sponsorship. The medical experience in Guatemala has been very rewarding for the many involved. Quality care is given, and gratitude returned. Instead of monetary remuneration, hearts are filled. The opportunity has often allowed families of team members to be involved and share in the joy of medicine and serving. The experiences have impacted the vocations of many. Lives are changed, both the people served and the people serving.”\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Beth Elliott, M.D. and Allan Gould, M.D.\n\nBeth Elliott was born and raised in Kentucky. After medical school at the University of Louisville in 1981, Beth moved to Rochester to begin her training in Anesthesiology. Her fellowship year in Rochester focused on Regional Anesthesia/Pain and Neuroanesthesia. She joined the staff in 1985, originally working at Rochester Methodist Hospital with the Vascular and Gynecologic surgeons. Beth eventually moved to St. Marys Hospital to join the Ortho Anesthesia group where she was integral to the development of the Acute Pain Service and the use of epidural analgesia for thoracic surgery patients. She also helped cover chronic pain consults at St. Marys Hospital, creating a busy block practice in addition to her work in the operating rooms. In 1995, Beth was named Division Chair of the Ortho Anesthesia group where she promptly led an effort to rename it the Central Division. She continued in this leadership role until 2005. She was awarded the Clinician of the Year award by her peers in 2007.\n\nAs a visiting medical student in 1980, Beth had the serendipitous opportunity to care for Dr. Virginia Hartridge as one of her first patients. Dr. Hartridge was the longtime medical director for the Nurse Anesthesia program at Mayo. This led to her initial interest in the nurse anesthesia program, triggering an educational pursuit that became a major part of her stellar career. Beth succeeded Dr. Bob Lennon as medical director for the nurse anesthesia program in 1991 and has held it to this day. Along with her CRNA colleagues, program directors Ed Thompson, CRNA and Mary Marienau, CRNA, she helped guide the program over the ensuing decades in the transitions from a Certificate program to a master’s degree program to the Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia program that it is today. In recognition of her long-term commitment and contributions to the education, Beth was awarded the Distinguished Educator Award from Mayo Clinic in 2009. This award is Mayo Clinic’s highest recognition in education.\n\nAnyone who sees Beth away from the OR (meaning not wearing scrubs) knows that she loves scarves and can be seen wearing one almost every day. Her collection of Hermes scarves goes back many years, adding to her travel adventures and making friends across the USA and Europe.\n\nIn addition to her scarves, Beth enjoys quilting and needlepoint. She and her husband of 33 years, Steve Rose, are avid skiers and still spend several weeks a year chasing the perfect powder day at Vail. Beth holds a unique distinction of having not just one . . . but three (!) holes-in-one on various golf courses around Minnesota. She is as skilled on the golf course as she is in clinical practice and education.\n\nDr. Allan Gould was born in Buffalo, NY and grew up in Piqua, Ohio. After college at Ohio State University, he attended Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, graduating in 1952. Within a week of graduating, he married Marilyn Buxton, his wife of 52 years. He served in the U.S. Army after an internship in Philadelphia and the first year of his anesthesiology residency training at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. He joined the Korean conflict as a physician in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit. He often chuckled at the humor and simultaneously shook his head in disbelief at the way movies and television shows depicted MASH units. He described his time in Korea in a department newsletter article written in 2003.\n\nAfter the conflict, Allan returned to Rochester to complete his anesthesia training and joined the staff in 1958. He had a distinguished career as a remarkable clinician. In his retirement year of 1991, Allan was recognized by his colleagues with the department’s Distinguished Clinician Award. For 8 years from 1972 through 1980, he chaired the Section of Anesthesia at the Rochester Methodist Hospital. Extramurally, Allan served as an ABA oral examiner, an editor of the ASA Newsletter, chair of the ASA Annual Meeting (twice!), and a member of the ASA’s Board of Governors. He also was president of the Minnesota Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\nAllan was widely admired by his colleagues. He and Marilyn enjoyed their five children, 8 grandkids, and 5 great grandkids during their retirement. They found great joy in working with the walnut trees they planted on their Fillmore County farm in southeast Minnesota and watching birds. Allan passed away on October 14, 2014.\n\nMystery Photo Contest Winner\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Dr. Joe Messick.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.\n\nReminder: We are now featuring two individuals each week for the Updates.

Eisenach, M.D.\n\nDepartment of Anesthesiology Alumnus: The Outstanding Dr. Jim Eisenach\n\nThere are few alumni who have been at the forefront of anesthesiology research and advances in the specialty more than Dr. James C. (Jim) Eisenach. Jim graduated from the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine in 1982. After an internship in that city, he came to Rochester for his residency training, entering what was to be the graduating class of 1985 with future academicians such as Brad Narr, Beth Elliott, and Tim Shine. A great summary of Jim’s time in Rochester is found in Reminiscences, his short story written for our May 2005 department newsletter.\n\nJim left Rochester in 1985 and served one year as a fellow in obstetric anesthesia at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He had left Mayo with a newly written NIH proposal in hand . . . and the start of nearly 40 years of continuous NIH funding in which he systematically studied selective spinal analgesics. He is a rare recipient of an NIH MERIT Award. He quickly rose to professor rank and holds the Francis M. James, III, M.D. Professorship of Anesthesiology. Jim was very involved in the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) leadership and served at the ASRA president in 2003. ASRA recognized his contributions with its 2005 John J. Bonica Award, its 2008 Gaston Labat Award, and its 2012 Distinguished Service Award.\n\nJim’s excellence in research put him on a path that led to his becoming one of the most influential anesthesiologists in the country. Jim served as Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesiology from 2007-2016 and president of the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research from 2016-2023. He was inducted into the National Academy of Medicine in 2015, received the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Excellence in Research Award in 2013, and gave the ASA’s Emery Rovenstine Lecture in 2015 and its John Severinghaus Lecture in Translational Science in 2021.\n\nBest of all, Jim is a really great person and a strong advocate for Mayo Clinic. Congratulations, and thank you for all you’ve done for the specialty, Jim.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Dan Cole, M.D. and Albert Faulconer, M.D.\n\nDan Cole was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Michigan. After graduating from Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan (20 miles northwest of South Bend, Indiana), he earned his M.D. from Loma Linda University, 60 miles east Los Angeles. He also completed his anesthesiology training there. Dan subsequently was a neuroanesthesiology fellow at the University of California, San Diego. Dan was a faculty member at Loma Linda University from 1986 through 2003. During his time in California, he rose within the California Society of Anesthesiologists’ leadership, serving as president in 2001-2002. He also was president of the Society of Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care from 2001-2002. It was obviously a very busy year.\n\nDan moved to Phoenix in 2003 and became chair of our Mayo Clinic Arizona Department of Anesthesiology. During that period, he worked with Dr. Renee Caswell and started our residency program and led a time of departmental growth which included the addition of a cardiac transplant and assist device program, and expansion of non-operating room anesthesia. He also served as the Vice-Dean of our Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development. Dan moved to the University of California, Los Angeles in 2013 as vice-chair of its Department of Anesthesiology. A prolific author and investigator, he currently is Professor of Anesthesiology at UCLA.\n\nDan is one of only 17 anesthesiologists who have served as president of both the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Board of Anesthesiology. While with the ABA, Dan was its Executive Director of Professional Affairs for 4 years. He also has been a director of the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research. In 2021, Dan became president of the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation and holds that position currently. Dan initiated the ASA’s Perioperative Brain Health, one of the specialty’s major initiatives to improve patient safety in the past 4 decades. He was recognized in 2020 by the ASA with its Distinguished Service Award, joining 6 other Mayo Clinic colleagues as a recipient of that award.\n\nDan and his wife, Cristine, have two sons (Steven and Andrew) and live in San Monica, California.\n\nAddendum: Although Dan has experienced many memorable events over the years, I am pleased to report that one of the better ones occurred during a summer visit to Rochester when I invited him to speak to our local colleagues and residents. Since it was a social event, I took Dan to lunch with a small group and we sat outside at Famous Dave’s restaurant. Yes, I was being frugal with our Mayo budget. Unfortunately, Dan sat in a large dollop of the restaurant’s famous BBQ sauce. His light tan pants were colorful, to say the least. Knowing that he had an upcoming presentation in the later afternoon, we rushed to my home to wash his pants. Dan is fit, in shape, and weighs less than two-thirds of what I do, so the substitute gym shorts I could provide as a temporary substitute were a little on the large size. A nice piece of rope as a belt fortunately saved the day until the dryer had completed its task. To be fair to Dan, I am not sharing any of the funny photos from that afternoon.\n\nAlbert Faulconer was born in Arkansas City, Kansas, south of Wichita near the Oklahoma border. He graduated from the University of Kansas Medical School in 1936. After a general internship and medicine residency, plus several years in clinical practice, he came to Rochester in 1943 as part of the 90-day “short course” anesthesia training for physicians who would subsequently play a major role in caring for injured soldiers/seaman/marines during WWII. After the war, he returned to Rochester, joining the anesthesia staff after only 6 months of clinical anesthesia training during his abbreviated residency. He was an exceptional research talent, developing an acoustic gas analyzer as part of his master’s degree thesis. The department almost lost him to Boston’s Harvard programs but a reportedly impassioned plea by Dr. John Lundy to the Mayo Board of Governors resulted in him being hired as a consultant before completing his training.\n\nAlbert became a major force in anesthesiology research during his career. An excellent summary of his career and legacy has been published by our own Drs. Peter Southorn, Mary Ellen Warner, Alan Sessler, and Kai Rehder. He used EEG techniques to determine the impact of both inhaled and intravenous anesthetics on the cerebral cortex. He demonstrated that nitrous oxide worked as an anesthetic . . . an assumption that was not universally accepted in the late 1940s and early 1950s. At that time, there was a prevailing wisdom that nitrous oxide worked through diffusion anoxia of the brain. He used a pressure chamber to give percentages of nitrous oxide greater than 80% but ensuring sufficient oxygen to volunteers who were in 2 atmospheres of pressure. He used EEG monitoring of the brain to detect changes depicting levels of anesthesia but not cerebral hypoxia.\n\nHis experience with EEG techniques led him to the concept of intraoperative cerebral monitoring to estimate depth of anesthesia. From that and work he did to show that anesthetics, especially intravenous anesthetics, lost their cerebral effects by distribution to other tissues in the body, he developed a computer-activated model to predict uptake and distribution of anesthetics. This then led him to use the model to test a servo-controlled anesthetic machine and a similar intravenous anesthetic infusion device. He soon found that a “closed-loop” computer approach to delivering anesthesia was not going to be successful without the input of trained anesthesia personnel. However, his work formed the basis of today’s processed cerebral monitors to estimate depth of anesthesia.\n\nAlbert’s outstanding and novel research earned him a position for 11 years (1950-1961) on the National Research Council’s Committee on Anesthesia. The Research Council was and continues to be the operational arm of the National Academy of Sciences. He was a founder of the Association of University Anesthesiologists and its president in 1956. He also was a director and president of the American Board of Anesthesiology during the 1955-1969 period. In 1953, he was appointed as chair of our Section of Anesthesiology and Intravenous Therapy. He led the section through several name changes, including 1970 when it was renamed as the Department of Anesthesiology. He stepped down as department chair in early 1971. He was a member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors from 1963 through 1969. Albert died on December 10, 1985.\n\nMystery Photo Contest Winner\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Dr. Marie DeRuyter.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.\n\nReminder: We are now featuring two individuals each week for the Updates. To be placed into the Mystery Photo Starbucks contest, you will need to correctly guess at least one of the featured individuals.

Far ahead of nearly all other early leaders of the specialty, he looked into the future and dreamed of ways that he and the colleagues he would recruit could have a positive impact in medicine beyond the operating rooms. One of his first steps was to expand the scope of anesthesia through the education of surgical (and subsequently anesthesia) fellows in anesthetic as well as surgical techniques. With the support of Drs. Will and Charlie Mayo, he developed an anatomy laboratory in which trainees could perform procedures and dissections on cadavers, in essence establishing one of the country’s first simulated surgical programs. His anatomy laboratory evolved into today’s Department of Anatomy at Mayo Clinic and its two major programs, the Microsurgery Training Center and the Clinical Anatomy Lab. His concept of anatomic training (i.e., cadaveric simulation) has been widely adopted in health science programs, medical schools, and graduate medical education across the U.S. and internationally.\n\nOur own Drs. Terry Ellis and Doug Bacon summarized Lundy’s remarkable vision and actions in establishing the anatomy laboratory in their excellent 2003 Mayo Clinic Proceedings article.\n\nThe Passing of Dr. Hugo Raimundo\n\nAlthough the Centennial Updates are written to provide historical information and context on the development of our department and the important innovations and leadership roles of department members, it seems appropriate to use the Updates to share news that will match with the interests of many of our Update readers.\n\nIn this instance, it is the passing of Hugo Raimundo. He was a major contributor to the strong and successful pediatric cardiac surgical program in Rochester. The following is taken from an obituary dedicated to him.\n\n“Dr. Raimundo died peacefully in his Phoenix home near the Mayo Clinic Hospital on March 7, 2024 following a courageous battle with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nHugo was born in 1937, in Panaji, Goa, India, which at the time was a Portuguese Colony. At the age of 17 he left Goa, traveling by boat across the Arabian Sea and through the Suez Canal to Portugal. He settled in Oporto where he went to medical school and interned at Hospital de Sao Joao from 1954-1961. He served mandatory time in the Portuguese Armed Forces as a medical officer from 1961 – 1965 and was in the horrific fighting within the jungles of Angola for much of that time. In 1965, Portugal remained under the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar and it was necessary for him to arrange travel to the United States, under cover, where he arrived with one suitcase containing all of his earthly belongings. He interned at Robert Packer Hospital, Guthrie Clinic in Sayre, Pennsylvania from 1965 – 1966. - He entered the Mayo Graduate School as a resident in general surgery in January 1967 and transferred to anesthesiology in 1969. He was appointed Consultant, Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester in 1972, specializing in cardiac anesthesia, with a special interest in pediatric cardiac anesthesia. He retired on December 31, 1999.”\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Duane Rorie, M.D. and Emerson Moffitt, M.D.\n\nDuane Rorie was born in Yellville in the north central region of Arkansas in 1936. He completed his undergraduate and M.D. degrees at the University of Arkansas, then earned a Ph.D. in anatomy from the University of Mississippi. He subsequently moved to Rochester for his anesthesiology residency and joined the staff in 1970. With the initial class of the new Mayo Medical School entering in 1972, Duane became the school’s first anatomist and taught clinical anatomy for 10 years as well as working in our department and obtaining his first NIH grant in 1977. He continued his success with a string of NIH grants until 1999. His grants focused on understanding the mechanisms and impact of anesthetics on norepinephrine and other neuropeptides, specifically how anesthetics attenuate sympathetic vasoconstriction. His clinical research was directed towards the anatomic considerations of regional anesthetic techniques.\n\nDuane served as the chair of our department’s Division of Anesthesiology at Rochester Methodist Hospital from 1980 through 1991. He advanced to chair of the department and continued in that role until 1999. He was an examiner of the American Board of Anesthesiology and a member of multiple honorary societies within the specialty. His excellence in research and education was recognized by the institution when he was appointed as its Reuben Eisenberg Professor in 1991. He is one of only 4 department members to be recognized as a named professor. Upon completing his role as department chair, Duane was asked to serve as the medical director of Mayo Clinic’s Procedural Skills Laboratory. His appointment brought the department full circle as the anatomy laboratory was first started by our own Dr. John Lundy in 1925 (see section above on the anatomy laboratory’s origin). Duane’s return to clinical anatomy leadership was defined by his refinement and expansion of the Procedural Skills Lab (Clinical Anatomy Lab – RST (mayo.edu) as well as his advocacy for a new Microsurgery Training Center Microsurgery Training Center (mayo.edu).\n\nOn rare instances, Duane would tell of the start of his rise within the Mayo Clinic hierarchy. He delighted in telling the story of his first committee role at Mayo . . . and as its chair, no less. He was asked to lead the institution’s Meal Policy Committee by Dr. Gene Mayberry, chair of our Board of Governors at the time. Candidly, there are only a handful of committees lower on the rung of Mayo’s committee ladder. One of those is the Surgical Scrub Suit Policy Committee . . . which was my first committee assignment as a chair (thank you, Bob Waller, successor to Gene Mayberry). Both chair roles were challenging (and a little painful) because few personnel affected by the policies of these two committees are happy about them. Duane and I shared more than a few laughs at how these assignments launched our careers, nearly derailing them right from the start.\n\nDuane passed away on March 7, 2014. His obituary in the Rochester Post-Bulletin may be found at Dr. Duane K. Rorie — Rochester - Post Bulletin | Rochester Minnesota news, weather, sports. Dr. Stephen Carmichael, emeritus professor of anatomy, wrote a tribute about Duane’s contributions to Mayo Clinic. Duane had a wonderful wife of 50 years, Carolyn, and two daughters.\n\nEmerson Moffitt was born in New Brunswick, Canada in 1924. He went to the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, although his undergraduate studies were interrupted by WWII and service in the Canadian Royal Navy Fleet, Air Arm. He graduated from Dalhousie Medical School in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1950 and entered general practice in North Sydney, Nova Scotia near Cape Breton Island. During his three years in general practice, he delivered hundreds of general and spinal anesthetics, triggering his desire to pursue further anesthesia training. In 1954 he moved to Rochester as a new resident working with John Lundy and others. He became very interested in the launch of the institution’s first cardiopulmonary bypass use in March 1955. Under the mentorship of Dr. Jeremy Swan (of Swan-Ganz catheter fame) and working with colleagues such as Drs. John Kirklin (CV Surgery), Earl Wood (Physiology), and Bob Patrick (Anesthesiology), he studied the physiologic effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and the management of anesthesia, anticoagulation, transfusion, and electrolytes during bypass. His work at that time, augmented by further studies with fellow anesthesiologists Drs. Dick Theye, Bob Devloo, Alan Sessler, and Dick Lundborg, led to the specialty’s fundamental understanding of cardiopulmonary bypass and management of cardiac surgical patients. Our own Drs. Adam Jacob, Doug Bacon, and Hugh Smith wrote an outstanding, well-referenced summary of Emerson’s contributions in 2007. Dr. Peter Southorn also wrote a wonderful, more personal story in 2004 about Emerson’s time at Mayo Clinic in our department newsletter.\n\nEmerson chaired the department’s Division of Anesthesiology at St. Marys Hospital from 1966 through 1971. In 1971, Dick Theye was chosen to succeed Dr. Albert Faulconer as chair of the newly renamed Department of Anesthesiology. Two other valued candidates for that position were Emerson and Dr. John (Tom) Martin. That transition, coupled with the early death of Emerson’s wife in 1972, triggered Emerson to decide to return with his two daughters to Nova Scotia. He was offered and accepted a position as chair of his medical school alma mater’s Department of Anesthesiology. His work in Nova Scotia and his ascent as Dean of Clinica Affairs at Dalhousie are well documented in David Shephard’s excellent summary.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.\n\nReminder: We are now featuring two individuals each week for the Updates.

White, M.D., undated.\n\nThe Department of Anesthesiology: The Miraculous Superhero Professor Roger White\n\nFew people have made a greater impact on medicine that Dr. Roger White. His expertise in cardiac anesthesia, understanding of cardiac rhythms, treatment of cardiac arrest, and leadership of Emergency Medical Services have resulted in numerous awards. More importantly, they have saved many lives.\n\nRoger was born in 1939 in Ontonagon, Michigan. A neat trivia question about Ontonagon: What incorporated U.S. town or city is the furthest west of any that use the Eastern Time Zone? It is just east of the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park along Lake Superior and an hour’s drive SW of Houghton, Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. It’s remarkable that a young man from Ontonagon has become one of the world’s most recognizable names in cardiac resuscitation.\n\nRoger graduated from the University of Michigan and its medical school. After an internship at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit in 1965, he moved to Rochester to start as a resident in Internal Medicine. His residency was interrupted by a 2 year tour of duty with the U.S. Army during which time he received on-the-job training in anesthesiology. It was a career-changing event as he returned to Rochester and switched his residency training to our specialty. It was our win and Internal Medicine’s loss. He went on to start working in cardiac anesthesia, a subspecialty in which he has worked for 54 years on the Mayo Clinic staff . . . and counting as he still continues to work clinically as well as on research projects.\n\nThis description in the October 2, 1970, Mayovox announces the start of his time on staff in Rochester:\n\nDuring his career, Roger has advocated for emergency medical services. He played a major role in establishing Rochester and southeast Minnesota’s emergency medical services. During his second year on staff, he wrote an excellent article describing the importance of physicians as leaders in pre-hospital emergency care. He became deeply involved in introducing advanced cardiac life support training into our Mayo Clinic hospitals and emergency medical services and instituting cardiac telemetry, radio communications between emergency services and physicians, and the use of resuscitation intravenous medications in pre-hospital settings.\n\nExamples of Roger’s incredible contributions to emergency medical services include the 1990 introduction of early defibrillation in Rochester (defibrillators in fire trucks, ambulances, and police cars). At that time, the program reported the highest survival rates in the U.S. from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation. In 2008, Roger and 5 colleagues authored the American Heart Association’s recommendations on “hand-only” (“chest compressions-only”) cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques. In 2011, Roger oversaw the 96-minute resuscitation of a man in cardiac arrest in Goodhue, Minnesota. He survived neurologically intact; it is believed to be the world’s longest successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Here you can read a case report and watch a video about this resuscitation. In recognition of his contributions, Roger was inducted into the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) World Hall of Fame in May 2022. Mayo’s Discovery Edge (Winter 2012) turned Roger and his team into superheroes in their description of their work . . . perhaps the best way to describe hyper-achievers.\n\nThere is so much more that can be said about Roger. He taught many of us who are left-handed how to cannulate the right internal jugular vein before ultrasound was introduced into routine practice. He led many Rochester department members annually through modified CPR training and dazzling us as he taught us how to recognize common as well as rare rhythms. Nearly every Rochester department member reached out to Roger for advice on how to interpret ECGs in the perioperative period. Less known is his classic ambulance collection.\n\nAn excellent video documentary about Gold Cross Ambulance, featuring Roger’s narrative, will be posted online at the National Emergency Medical Services Museum later this month (Virtual National EMS Museum - EMS Museum). Here is a photo from that video:\n\nCongratulations, Roger, on an outstanding career. And for many more years that we can lean on your expertise.\n\nMystery Photos\n\nLast week’s Mystery Photos were Joseph Messick, M.D. and Michael Geisler, CRNA.\n\nJoe Messick was born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1935. After college at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, he earned his M.D. degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine. He was a resident in anesthesiology at the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia, one of several hospitals affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, from 1961 through 1964. He then spent two years in the U.S. Navy. Upon completion of his military duties, Joe moved to Rochester for additional training in anesthesiology and earned his Master’s degree from the University of Minnesota. His mentors for his thesis were Drs. Dick Theye, Albert Faulconer, Ward Fowler, and Jack Michenfelder, a pretty star-studded group. His thesis was directed towards understanding the impact of common anesthetics and adjuvant drugs on whole body and cerebral oxygen consumption rates.\n\nJoe was integrated into what was then, and was to remain, one of the most productive and visible neuroanesthesia groups in the world. He joined colleagues such as Drs. Jack Michenfelder, Kai Rehder, and Gerry Gronert. He was initially assigned to the cardiac group, but when Gerry was drafted into the Army, he was asked to transition to neuroanesthesia. Drs. Roy Cucchiara, and Ron Faust soon followed as members of the group, as did Drs. Leslie Milde and Bill Lanier. It was a remarkable period of discovery in neuroanesthesia. Drs. Thor Sundt, Ed Law, Frank Sharbrough, and others in neurosurgery and neurology contributed. Joe chaired the Section on Neuroanesthesia from 1978 through 1984. During that period he led the introduction of routine use of mass spectrometry into neuroanesthesia in Rochester, a project he and Dr. Duane Rorie expanded to all Rochester operating rooms during the mid-1980s when they chaired the Divisions of St. Marys Hospital Anesthesiology and Rochester Methodist Hospital Anesthesiology, respectively. Their strong support for mass spectrometry and the installation of pulse oximeters into every operating room during their division chair tenures led to advanced intraoperative monitoring that transformed the specialty and patient safety at Mayo Clinic.\n\nJoe served as chair of the Division of St. Marys Hospital Anesthesiology from 1984 through 1988. He earned Teacher of the Year recognition in 1988 as he transitioned his clinical activities and leadership to the management of in-hospital pain. He was indefatigable in that role, starting a pain medicine fellowship and in-patient services at both Rochester hospitals. He chaired the Division of Pain Medicine until his retirement in 1997. He retired as a Professor Emeritus.\n\nIt is worth noting that Joe was a wonderful and gentle soul with an amazingly gracious bedside manner. That characteristic served him well throughout his career, whether in patient care or administrative leadership roles. He was president of the Minnesota Society of Anesthesiologists in 1977-1978. He currently resides in Rochester.\n\nMike Geisler completed his nurse anesthesia education at the Mayo School of Health Related Science in 1984. Before that, he worked at Rochester Methodist Hospital as an RN in the old \"11-1 Unit\" (Respiratory ICU) and then as the Head Nurse of the Plastic Surgery Unit. Mike's father served our country as a member of the Defense Intelligence Agency of the US Army, which influenced Mike's childhood by living in numerous places around the world. He and his family lived in Tehran, Iran, for three years, in Bangkok, Thailand, for four years, and in Frankfurt and Stuttgart, Germany, for eight years. He spent most of his childhood in other countries, exposed to various cultures and languages. Mike was fluent in Thai as a toddler.\n\nMike and his family returned to the US in time for him to complete his senior year of high school in Southern Pines, North Carolina. Two years after graduating from high school, in 1972, Mike received his military draft notice. He enlisted in the US Navy and served as a Corpsman with the US Marine Corps. As a corpsman, he became aware of the profession of nurse anesthesia by watching Navy CRNAs at work in the operating room. This exposure led him down his professional career path, which he enjoyed for 38 years.\n\nIn 1997, Mike was asked by Dr. Jeffry Steers, a Liver Transplant surgeon in Rochester, to assist him in organizing and educating a new Liver Transplant team for Mayo Jacksonville. Mike was an integral part of the Rochester anesthesia team and participated, along with Dr. Steve Rettke, in the first liver transplant in Rochester. When Dr. Steers approached Mike about relocating to Jacksonville, the Mayo Department of Anesthesiology in Jacksonville was comprised of approximately 10 CRNA's and 8 anesthesiologists. A short time after the formulation of the Liver Transplant Team, he was asked by Dr. Tim Lamer, Chair of the Department of Anesthesiology, to assume the position of Chief CRNA. As a result of the Mayo Jacksonville Liver Transplant program and subsequent heart and lung transplantation, the nurse anesthesia component of the Anesthesia Care Team grew to approximately 34 CRNAs. Mayo Jacksonville’s Liver Transplant Program evolved into the nation's most extensive and successful liver transplant program.\n\nMike has been recognized for his clinical expertise and contributions beyond the boundaries of Mayo Clinic. In 1999, he was awarded the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists’ Clinical Practitioner of the Year Award. Mike remained in the Chief CRNA position in Jacksonville until 2002. He subsequently followed his desire to return to clinical practice, retired from the Chief position, and returned as a staff member in the department. He retired from Mayo in 2007 but not from the practice of nurse anesthesia. In 2007, Mike and his wife Deb formed an anesthesia staffing group that provided anesthesia services to local surgery centers, oral surgery groups, and hospitals. In recognition of Guedel's teachings, the group was named \"Stage II Anesthesia.\"\n\nMike continued providing anesthesia services until his retirement in 2022. He currently lives in Jacksonville, FL, on the Intracoastal Waterway within view of the Mayo Clinic campus. He enjoys fishing, sailing, playing guitar, and spending time with family, including three lovely grandchildren.\n\nMystery Photo Contest Winner\n\nLast week’s contest winner was Sandy Simonson.\n\nHere are this week’s Mystery Photos.
