        "text": "Jo Van Fleet was an American actress who had a long and distinguished career on stage, film, and television. She won an Oscar and a Tony award for her performances, and was known for playing characters much older than her actual age. She died in 1996 at the age of 80, but the cause of her death was never publicly revealed. What was the reason behind this mystery, and what did she leave behind as her legacy?\n\nEarly Life and Training\n\nJo Van Fleet was born on December 29, 1915 in Oakland, California, as Catherine Josephine Van Fleet. She was the younger of two daughters of Roy H. Van Fleet and Elizabeth “Bessie” Catherine Gardner, who were natives of Indiana and Michigan respectively. Her father worked for the railroads, but died of a streptococcus throat infection when she was five years old. Her mother, who had been widowed by 1920, worked as a sales lady in an Oakland dry goods store to support herself and her two daughters. They lived with Bessie’s relatives, Ralph and Mary Gardner, in Oakland.\n\nJo Van Fleet had an early interest in stage productions, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936, focusing on a variety of subjects. She then spent several years as a high school teacher in Morro Bay, California, before pursuing her theatrical training in a graduate program at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California. She moved to New York City after her graduation, where she continued her training with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She also became a member of Elia Kazan’s Actors Studio, where she studied with Lee Strasberg.\n\nStage Career and Awards\n\nJo Van Fleet made her professional stage debut in 1944, playing Miss Phipps in the production of Uncle Harry at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. She received positive reviews for her performance, and soon moved to Broadway, where she distinguished herself in various roles. She played Dorcas in Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale in 1946, and Regan opposite Louis Calhern in King Lear in 1950. She also appeared in plays by Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, William Inge, and others.\n\nShe won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 1954 for her portrayal of Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote’s The Trip to Bountiful, costarring Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint.

Her performance was praised by critics and audiences alike, and established her as a notable dramatic actress.\n\nFilm Career and Oscar\n\nDespite her success on stage, Jo Van Fleet did not work in films until 1954, when Elia Kazan encouraged her to move to Hollywood. He cast her in his screen adaptation of John Steinbeck’s East of Eden (1955) for Warner Bros., where she played Kate Ames Trask, the estranged mother of James Dean’s character Cal Trask. She was only 11 years older than Dean, but convincingly portrayed a woman who had aged prematurely due to her life of sin and crime. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her debut film role, beating out such actresses as Natalie Wood and Marisa Pavan.\n\nShe continued to work in films throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often playing mothers or older women.

She also worked with directors such as Daniel Mann, John Sturges, Robert Wise, Roman Polanski, and others.\n\nTelevision Work and Later Years\n\nJo Van Fleet also appeared in many television shows during her career, ranging from drama to comedy to musicals. She starred in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella (1965) as the wicked stepmother opposite Lesley Ann Warren as Cinderella.

She then retired from acting and lived a quiet life in New York City. She was married to William G. Bales, a dancer and choreographer, from 1946 until his death in 1990. They had one son, Michael, who became a musician and composer. She also had one granddaughter.\n\nCause of Death and Legacy\n\nJo Van Fleet died on June 10, 1996 at the age of 80, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City. The cause of her death was not reported, and her body was cremated and her ashes were returned to her family. According to IMDb, she died of undisclosed causes.
