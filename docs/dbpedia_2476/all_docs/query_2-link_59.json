As a result, the campus group was formed and sent delegates to the national convention of the League of Women Voters, which focused on international peace. Those delegates were Helen Greene Clark '31 and Marian Allen '25. I was among those who collected contributions to send them to the national convention, held in Richmond, Va. Mrs. Dexter Perkins was our advisor and Doctor Perkins often joined us at meetings. Over the years, many of my friends continued their interest in the League and in politics.\" She says that she was active in politics until recently and adds that \"Mary Leader Lewis is still only a phone call away and we visit from time to time.
