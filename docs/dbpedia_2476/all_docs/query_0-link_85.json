        "text": "Penn Graduate School of Education: $16.25 Million Gift from the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Family Foundation\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania has announced a $16.25 million commitment from the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Family Foundation to its Graduate School of Education (Penn GSE). The gift is the largest ever received by Penn GSE. It directs $10 million to the preparation of leaders who can navigate change, through the creation of the new McGraw Center for Educational Leadership. An additional $6.25 million will expand existing support for the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education, which has been housed within Penn GSE since 2020.\n\n“We all know that leadership matters, and few things matter more to our society than cultivating leaders who can navigate change and are devoted to educating people at every stage of their lives,” said Penn President Liz Magill. “With the launch of the McGraw Center, those dedicated to teaching and learning will be able to devise more effective responses to the rapidly changing needs of learners today. We are deeply grateful to the McGraw family for their exceptional generosity.”\n\nThe Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Family Foundation, Inc. is a not-for-profit private foundation whose primary mission is to improve the lives of others through thoughtful grantmaking focused on education, youth services, community health, and medical research. It honors the legacy of the former chairman and CEO of McGraw-Hill, a global educational publishing and financial services company. Mr. McGraw spent his career advancing education and literacy.\n\n“We are tremendously thankful that the McGraw family has made this new Center possible,” said Pam Grossman, dean of Penn GSE and the George and Diane Weiss Professor of Education. “More and more, society needs educators who are well prepared to respond to the accelerated rate of change in the educational landscape, to turn challenges into opportunities, and to develop pioneering solutions to complex problems. Building on Penn GSE’s outstanding legacy of preparing leaders in n preK-12, higher education, and workplace learning, the new center will champion innovation across thought and practice.”\n\nSlated to launch in fall 2023, the center’s portfolio of programs will focus on meeting challenges in education with an entrepreneurial spirit. Participants will include doctoral students, mid-career school and higher education leaders, and corporate chief learning officers.\n\n“My father would be thrilled by the partnership we have established with Penn GSE,” said Harold (Terry) McGraw III, former chairman, president and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies and a 1976 graduate of the Wharton School. “He believed that excellence and innovation in education should be celebrated, and Penn GSE provides a world class platform to fulfill and expand our mission.”\n\nThe McGraw Prize in Education honors those who are transforming teaching and learning with three $50,000 awards in preK-12 education, higher education, and learning science research annually. On the evening of November 3, Penn GSE hosted an awards gala honoring 2022 winners Cheryl Logan, superintendent of Omaha Public Schools; Barry Dunn, president of South Dakota State University, and Roy Pea, David Jacks Professor of Education & Learning Sciences at Stanford University.\n\nPast recipients have included Sal Khan, founder and executive director of Khan Academy; Alberto Carvahlo, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District; and Wendy Kopp, founder of Teach for America.\n\n“Our family is enormously excited about the new McGraw Center for Educational Leadership,” said Terry McGraw. “Our shared goal with Penn GSE is to develop future generations of leaders spanning all types of education—from pre-school through corporate learning—who are at the forefront of educational excellence in the 21st century.”\n\nMore than 50 graduates of the school’s doctoral programs in higher education management are currently serving as college presidents. The Chief Learning Officer doctoral program, the first of its kind when it launched more than twenty years ago, has prepared leaders in workplace learning in finance, internet and technology, and manufacturing. Hundreds of alumni of Penn GSE’s school leadership master’s and doctoral programs serve as superintendents, principals, and other school leaders across the nation.\n\n“The McGraw Center will have a multiplier effect, impacting schools, districts, colleges, universities, and workplaces on a vast scale,” said Dean Grossman. “We have deeply valued our ongoing partnership with the McGraw Family Foundation over the past several years and look forward to taking this next transformational step together.”\n\nThe center will be housed in Penn GSE’s ambitious building expansion (Almanac May 3, 2022), currently underway, which will feature 21st-century instructional spaces and support the school’s portfolio of innovation, education, and leadership programs in the heart of the Penn campus.\n\nReport of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility for the 2021-2022 Academic Year\n\nCommittee on Manufacturer Responsibility\n\nI would like to thank Steven O. Kimbrough, professor of operations, information and decisions, the Wharton School, for his leadership this past year as chair of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility. I also thank all committee members for their participation and thoughtful contributions.\n\nThe committee’s report for 2021-2022 is below.\n\n—Medha Narvekar, Vice President and University Secretary\n\nThe following report for the 2021-2022 academic year was sent to Medha Narvekar, Vice President and University Secretary from Dr. Kimbrough, chair of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility (CMR), in accordance with the effectiveness of monitoring; review the state of compliance of the apparel licensees and review any alleged violations of the Code.\n\nThe Code of Workplace Conduct for the Penn Licensed Product Manufacturers is attached hereto below and published of record.\n\nReport of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility for the 2021-2022 Academic Year\n\nIt is my pleasure to report on the deliberations of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility during the 2021-2022 academic year.\n\nCode Compliance\n\nAs of June 2022, 134 of 135 licensees were reviewed.

Introduction\n\nWith a view to stimulating economic growth and development, raising living standards, meeting staffing requirements and overcoming unemployment and underemployment, the University of Pennsylvania has adopted this Code of Workplace Conduct (the code) to promote full, productive and freely-chosen employment.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania expects its licensees to conduct their business in a manner consistent with this code, and to follow workplace standards that adhere to this code. The code is subject to amendment to reflect any subsequently developed standards by the University.\n\nII. Notice\n\nThis code shall apply to all trademark licensees of the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout this code the term “licensee” shall include all persons or entities that have entered a written licensing agreement with the University to manufacture products bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of the University. Additionally, this code shall apply to all of the licensee’s contractors. Throughout this code the term “contractor” shall include each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, or manufacturer that is engaged in a manufacturing process that results in a finished product for the consumer. “Manufacturing process” shall include assembly and packaging.\n\nAs a condition of being permitted to produce and/or sell licensed products bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of the University, each licensee must comply with this code and ensure that its contractors comply with this code. All licensees and contractors are required to adhere to this code, however, no licensee or contractor may represent that they have been certified as being in compliance with this code.\n\nIII. Standards\n\nUniversity licensees and their contractors must operate workplaces that adhere to the following minimum standards and practices:\n\nA. Legal Compliance\n\nUniversity licensees and their contractors must comply, at a minimum, with all applicable legal requirements of the country in which products are manufactured. Where this code and the applicable laws of the country of manufacture conflict or differ, the higher standard shall prevail. Such compliance shall include compliance with all applicable environmental laws.\n\nB. Ethical Principles\n\nLicensees shall commit to conducting their business according to a set of ethical standards that include, but are not limited to, honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and respect for the unique intrinsic value of each human being.\n\nC. Environmental Compliance\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors will be committed to the protection of the local environment, including their factories and their surroundings. They will protect residential areas around their factories, disposing of garbage and waste in such a way so as not to endanger the safety and health of nearby areas.\n\nD. Employment Standards\n\n1. Wages and Benefits\n\nLicensees and their contractors must provide wages and benefits which comply with all applicable laws and regulations and which match or exceed the local prevailing wages and benefits in the relevant industry, whichever provides greater wages and benefits. The University is strongly committed to the employees of licensees receiving a “living wage.”\n\n2. Hours of Work\n\nc. Except in extraordinary circumstances, or as required by business necessity, employees shall not be required to work (regardless of location) more than the lesser of:\n\niv. forty eight (48) hours per week and twelve (12) hours of overtime; or\n\nv. the limits on the regular and overtime hours allowed by the law of the country\n\nvi. In addition to their compensation for regular hours of work, employees shall be compensated for overtime hours at such a premium rate as is legally required in that country, but not less than at a rate equal to their regular hourly compensation rate.\n\ng. Employees shall be entitled to at least one day off in every seven (7) day period.\n\n3. Homework\n\nThe employer must ensure that work not done at the place of manufacture is performed in a manner safe for the employee and any persons who may be in the surrounding vicinity.\n\n4. Child Labor\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall not employ any person younger than 15 (or 14 where the law of the country of manufacture allows) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture where such age is higher than 15. Young workers will not be forced to work overtime hours that would prevent them from attending school. Licensees agree to work with governmental, human rights and non-governmental organizations as determined by the University and licensee to minimize the negative impact on any child released from employment as a result of enforcement of this code.\n\n5. Forced Labor\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall not use any forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise.\n\n6. Harassment or Abuse\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall treat every employee with respect and dignity. Licensees and their subcontractors will not subject any employee to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse.\n\n7. Nondiscrimination\n\na. Licensees and their subcontractors will not subject any person to any discrimination in employment, including hiring, salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement, on the basis of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital status, nationality, political opinion or political affiliation, union involvement, or social or ethnic origin. Because, historically, the overwhelming majority of workers in light industry are women, assuring and safeguarding women’s rights is of particular importance for all parties.\n\nb. Women workers will receive equal remuneration for comparable work, including benefits, equal treatment, equal evaluation of the quality of their work, and equal opportunity to fill all positions as male workers. Pregnancy tests will not be a condition of employment, nor will they be demanded of employees. Workers will not be forced or pressured to use contraception.\n\nc. Women who take maternity leave will not, because of the maternity leave, face dismissal or threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or reduction of wages. Licensees must permit women returning from maternity leave to return to their prior position or comparable position at least at their prior wage rate and benefits. Local laws and regulations, or the prevailing practice in the relevant industry, whichever is greater, shall determine appropriate length of maternity leave.\n\nd. Licensees and their subcontractors shall provide, to the extent required by applicable law and regulations, or the local prevailing practice in the relevant industry, whichever is greater, services and accommodations to pregnant women, including but not limited to access to legally required health care provided by the employer, government or other provider.\n\n8. Health and Safety\n\nLicensees and their contractors must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment free from recognized hazards and must, at a minimum, comply with local and national health and safety laws. If residential facilities are provided to workers, they must be safe and healthy facilities. Workers will not be exposed to conditions that may endanger their reproductive health without their informed consent.\n\n9. Freedom of Association\n\nLicensees and their contractors shall recognize freedom of association and collective bargaining with bargaining representatives of their own choice. No employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation as a result of his or her efforts to freely associate or bargain collectively.\n\nIV. Compliance\n\nPrior to the date of annual renewal of a license agreement, the licensee shall be required to provide the following to the University, as set forth in the license agreement.\n\nA. The company names, owners and/or officers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and the nature of the business association of all the licensees’ contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks and/or images of the University;\n\nB. Written assurances that it and its contractors adhere to this code (except that in the initial phase-in period, licensee must provide such written assurances within six months of receipt of this code); and\n\nC. A summary of the steps taken, and/or difficulties encountered, during the preceding year in implementing and enforcing this code at each site.\n\nLicensees and/or their contractors are responsible for conducting regular inspections of each facility at which University products are manufactured to ensure workplaces are free from recognized hazards as established in consensus standards as well as hazards as defined by local law.\n\nV. Remediation\n\nIf the University determines that any licensee or contractor has failed to remedy a violation of this code, the University reserves the right to terminate its relationship with any licensee in accordance with the terms set forth in the licensee agreement.\n\nVI. Public Disclosure\n\nThe company names, owners, and/or officers, addresses, and nature of the business association, including the steps performed in the manufacturing process, of all the licensees’ contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks and or images of the University shall be made public information.\n\nThe licensee shall be required to supply each year a list of all factory locations referred to in paragraph A above, and all locations licensee anticipates will be used during the term of the license. Any additions or deletions to this list shall be reported to the University within two months of the effective date of such addition or deletion.\n\nVII.

This responsibility will include the compilation of a list of licensees and the maintenance of any relevant records necessary to enforce the code, including information received from monitoring organizations about licensees for consideration by the committee. The intern will also actively work on developing mechanisms with other campuses who have signed codes of conduct to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the codes.\n\nB.
