        "text": "I grew up in a family of singers. When I graduated from Hollywood High, I was chosen to sing a Victor Herbert song at the Hollywood Bowl. I worked in nightclubs during and after high school. I sang in Vegas back when it only had two hotels. To get the jobs, you had to sing both popular and classical songs because you never knew what would be requested. Even before I went overseas to entertain the boys, I was traveling everywhere. But the thing I loved most in my performing days was singing for the soldiers. Oh, thereâs nothing like it.\n\nThere were about ten people in my USO crewâsingers, dancers, a comedian, a master of ceremonies.(1) We couldnât wear dresses when we were overseas; we had to wear uniforms, very nice jackets and pants. At night we put on the glamorous stuff. I remember singing the song âEmbraceable Youâ because the sailors requested it all the time. Sometimes we performed for five hundred people, sometimes we played for a group of ten. Once I sang and played the ukulele for two soldiers guarding a bridge.\n\nI was never homesick, and I loved every moment. We were stationed in the Moana Hotel in Hawaii for five months before we started traveling the islands in the Pacific. There was only one time when I got scared, and that was in Guam. A siren went off and we were driven up a hill to an air shelter. It ended up being a hurricane, and we stayed in the shelter with all the navy guys for three daysâfood rationing, cots, the whole experience. I felt like one of the boys.\n\nIt wasnât just sing-y and it wasnât just dance-yâreal stuff was going on. We performed in hospitals, sometimes where the boys were badly hurt. Someone once cried while I was singing prettyâthat was hard to take. But I just had to remember that I was doing something good. One time a soldier came up to me with his head all wrapped up and said, âIâm President Truman.â The hospital staff had told us, âWhatever he tells you, believe it.â So we all said, âOh, weâre very happy to know you, President Truman.â Every time we ran into him, we said, âHow are you, Mr. President?â There were a lot of terrible things going on, but there was a surprising amount of humor.\n\n1.

When the war broke out, I was just out of high school, and my brothers and I worked in my fatherâs bakery. In the mornings I went into the mountains to pick fruit from the trees so my mother could sell guavas and bananas from a little basket. Thatâs how we maintained our livelihood. There wasnât much news about the war. All I knew was that the Japanese started bombing Hawaii, and since we were an American outpost, they started to bomb Manila, too. We heard the Japanese would be coming from the north of the Philippines, so a strategy was devised to send defenses to Bataan.\n\nWe were not really prepared for the Japanese when they bombed us early in the morning. The airplanes kept coming and strafing our troops until around dawn, when we were told to withdraw. Then we heard the news that there was an order to surrender. The Japanese told us to come down the hills to the road to start marching. It was a very hot day in April, and whenever we came across a stream, soldiers would try to get a drink of water. The water was oily because there were dead soldiers up in the hill. People got sick with malaria, dysentery, and all kinds of diseases.(1)\n\nDuring the march I found two of my classmates from high school, and we started to plan an escape. When darkness came the three of us got out of the line and went toward the beach. We found some civilian clothes. We contracted with a fisherman to take us across Manila Bay. A man approached us soon after we arrived. He knew about all the Japanese roadblocks and the way the soldiers searched. He asked, âDo you know how they can recognize that you are soldiers? Look at your feet.â Our feet were kind of white, while the rest of our bodies were dark. Thatâs how the Japanese could pick out the escaped soldiers.\n\nWhen I got to my hometown of Tanay, I was trembling from malaria. It took a while to recover. My mom was very scared, because she had three sons, all in hiding. During the occupation, everyone was under suspicion. I immigrated to the United States in 1948. I took an entrance examination, which admitted me into University of California Berkeley. A friend told me about a Filipino girl who went to his wifeâs laundry shop. It turned out she was a guerilla nurse in a neighboring province during World War II, but I met her at a Chinese laundry in Oakland!\n\n1. On April 9th, 1942, American and Filipino soldiers charged with the defense of the islands of Luzon, Corregidor, and the Philippines were ordered to surrender to Japanese forces. Over seventy thousand troops in the province of Bataan were forcibly marched sixty miles over the course of a week to prisoner camps in the province of Tarlac. Undernourished and ill, vulnerable to extreme heat and thirst, and subjected to physical abuse, torture, and execution, thousands died along the way.\n\nEdited from The Last Good War, published by Welcome Books, text by VERONICA KAVASS, used with permission, photo 2009.\n\nI left my hometown of Beaumont, Texas, and didnât return for forty years. My strongest ambition since childhood was to learn languages and see the world. The man my father worked for owned Spindletop, the first oil gusher in Texas. He used his power to promote education and a solid local justice system. Under that influence, I went to college in Chicago and moved from there to Seattle because I heard that it was the best place for blacks to work. My first job was shining shoes, but within months I became a timekeeper for the Army Quartermaster Corps.(1) I kept climbing the ladder until I was drafted.\n\nI was assigned to the 780th Military Police Battalion, which was all black except for the officers. We landed in Casablanca, but I spent most of my time in Algiers doing military police duties. One of my stations was the Office of Strategic Servicesâwhich is now called the CIA.(2) It was my duty to observe everything that took place at the entrance gate to the OSS headquarters. After that post, I was transferred to Marseilles, France, where I was in charge of traffic control and guarding prisoners, who were mainly incarcerated Germans.\n\nWhen the war ended, all the American soldiers were impatient to get back to the States. Not me. I remained in France to learn French and got accepted into the London School of Economics, where I studied law and languages. I met my wife at a dance in London. She was a German and Japanese beauty who wanted to find an American husband. After we married she went by herself to take a medical examinationâthe final step in getting her visa. She returned very disturbed because they had rejected her due to her Japanese heritage. Having training in law, I was able to do what was proper and necessary to get her into the country, but I had to go through quite a lot of channels. I wrote letters to people of power, starting with President Truman and Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State. I was able to cite the law that proved she had a right to a visa. I sent letters to senators, the NAACP, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a United Nations delegate. In fighting for her, I was fighting against the blanket of racial prejudice, and it proved to be effective. Mrs. Roosevelt and several other politicians wrote back, stating that they were considering the matter. My wife was admitted into the country shortly thereafter, and I went on to study law at New York University.\n\n1.

On the way to my outfit, our ship passed the remains of the Japanese attack: planes and ships underwater, the water filled with oil. We were called to stand at attention and hand-salute because the divers were bringing up a black bag from the oily waters. We didnât know what it was, but we stood and saluted. I was just a young lad; it was touching.\n\nAt Kaneohe Bay, I serviced planes that were coming in from the mainland. Once my crew and I were assigned to replace a gas tank, and it wasnât aligning properly. An impatient officer among the others asked, âCan I get my foot in there yet?â I looked up to find a gentleman in a flight suit that said Commander OâHare. He was a big lanky guy. He stuck his long leg in there and took a couple of pokes and said, âIâm satisfied. Get it all together, let me know what the outcome is. Iâm missing out on my flights.â After it was assembled, to my dismay, I was told. that it was no good. One of the chiefs said, âWell, Commander OâHare is going to get a new plane.â Shortly after, he and his plane disappeared when he was leading a fight against two Japanese bombers. They named the Chicago airport OâHare in memory of him.(1)\n\nMy brothers and I were in the service at the same time. One went up in the Army and did severe fighting with General Patton. Another was on a destroyer in the Pacific Theater. There was the Marine who got injured in Iwo Jima. When the war ended, my motherâs prayers were answered: we all made it home. On my last day, my lieutenant told me that the war was over and that I was eligible to go home on the point system. He said, âBut Iâll make a deal with you. Youâre a first-class mechanic. Iâll give you a chief âs rating.â I said no. I told him: âI promised a young girl I would come home and we would get married.â And I came home. And here it is sixty-four years later, and weâre still together.\n\n1. Lieutenant Commander Edward Henry OâHare was a decorated fighter pilot from Chicago, the first naval aviator recipient of the Medal of Honor in World War II.\n\nEdited from The Last Good War, published by Welcome Books, text by VERONICA KAVASS, used with permission, photo 2009\n\nThe draft board sent all Los Angeles draftees to Fort MacArthur to be inducted into the service. After some very difficult basic training, I took an exam and got accepted and went down to Miami Beach, Florida. The Air Force had taken over all these resorts and used them to house all of the personnel. Our class in itself included five thousand people. Seventeen out of five thousand men in officers training for the U.S. Air Force were black. The experience was good there. The classes were integrated. When we finished the course, all seventeen of us were then assigned to Tuskegee, and to the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group.(1)\n\nWe were sent overseas to Italy, where I had an intelligence officer assignment. Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, our commander, really insisted on the planes escorting the bombers and not getting distracted by the enemy fighters. We had an excellent record in comparison to other fighter groups. The 332nd was good at protecting bombers, but the oss of our own pilots was a very emotional thing. It is difficult to accept the âhere today and gone tomorrowâ element of war.\n\nBut bad times were balanced out with good. One major mission was a long-distance one to Berlin. The fighters had to carry extra gasoline tanks in order to escort the bombers to the target and back. It was one of the few times that the Eighth Air Force and the Fifteenth Air Force coordinated to help knock the Germans out of the war. It was a hazardous mission, because the Germans were defending their capital as strongly as they could. But we succeeded, and it felt really good to be part of such a major moment in the war.\n\nOne of the reasons that the Tuskegee Airman organization was started was to let the world know that there were black pilots fighting in World War II. When we got back, nobody believed it had actually happened. It wasnât really until around 1972 that the Tuskegee organization formed to promote the legacy and formally asked people to do what they could to spread the word. We received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007, and President Bush saluted the Tuskegee Airmen for the many salutes that they had not received during their active duty. Often, a white enlisted person did not salute a black officer. The big salute from the president symbolized all the missed ones.\n\n1. Americaâs first black military aviators were trained at Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama, which provided the origin of their popular title: the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nEdited from The Last Good War, published by Welcome Books, text by VERONICA KAVASS, used with permission, photo 2009. Mr. Lumpkin is not a Belmont Village resident.\n\nThey drafted me two days before Pearl Harbor, but I was sent home because my heart was wrong. My this was wrong, my that was wrong; everything was wrong. That was on a Friday. On Sunday, Pearl Harbor happened. Monday morning, the Army calls me back again. âWe have to reexamine you.â And what do you know? I turned into the healthiest guy in the world. They put me in a cab with a couple of other boys and took me to the OâHare airfield in Chicago. Eight hours later, I was in Hawaii.\n\nThey told me I was in the Seventh Air Force. I met with the captain and he asked, âSo youâre a pretty good mechanic?â âYeah, yeah,â I told him. I lied. The next day I met with my newly assigned captain. âCaptain,â I said, âeverything you see on that record is a lot of BS. I only worked as a mechanic for about three weeks.â He looked at me for a whileâthe way teachers have looked at me certain times in my life. âOkay, at least youâre honest,â he said. âI want you to meet the boy who is the head of the maintenance department. Heâll stay with you about a month, teach you as much as he can get into your head, and then heâll be discharged.â I was ecstatic. He wagged his finger at me, âDonât BS these guys.â\n\nWe hopped from island to island, following the Marines as they knocked them out to get to the Japanese. We were sent down to a little island called Kanton in the South Pacific. It was as big as a postage stamp. No dirt. No trees. Just plain white sand. My officer would tell me, âFred, youâre going to get all kinds of garbage. God willing, I want to have the maximum of forty airplanes ready to fly. Beg. Borrow. Steal. Except one thing: if I ask you what happened, I want the truth so I know how to cover for you.â\n\nSome days were calm and we had fun. And there were some days when we were under attack. We would get into a foxhole until it was over. Weâd push our way out of the sand. There was always damage. People always got hit. So we had to have regular burials. They used to take the boysâall the pieces of the parts of their bodiesâout to the far end of the island, whichever island we happened to be on, and dig a deep hole, and dump everyone in it, close it up and that was it.\n\nEdited from The Last Good War, published by Welcome Books, text by VERONICA KAVASS, used with permission, photo 2009"
