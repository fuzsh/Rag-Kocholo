Despite stating that he was not and never had been homosexual, Craig announced on September 1, 2007 that he would resign from the Senate, effective September 30, 2007, but later reversed this decision and decided to finish the remainder of his term, although he chose not to run for re-election in 2008.He was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor and former Governor Jim Risch, who won the seat in the November 2008 election.
