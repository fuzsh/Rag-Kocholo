        "text": "10/17/1845 – 12/15/1898\n\nCalvin Stewart Brice was born in Morrow County, Ohio. Brice was the son of Rev. William K. and Elizabeth Stewart Brice. He did his preparatory and undergraduate work at Miami University, Oxford, where he enlisted in the Union Cause. Following his time in college and military service, he returned to Lima, where his family had moved. Brice then pursued graduate work at the law school of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and was admitted to the bar. He practiced in Lima but was not overly successful until he expanded his view to include the legal problems of the railroads. He first worked with the Lake Erie & Western Railroad and then became involved in the development of the Nickel Plate Road. Overall, he helped organize eleven railroads during his career. He was a delegate from Ohio at the 1888 Democratic National Convention, and the following year Brice was elected Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In 1890, he was elected Senator from Ohio and served from 1891 through 1897. At the time of his death in 1898, he was beginning to launch a Chinese railroad.\n\n7/17/1917 – 8/20/2012\n\n​Phyllis Diller was born and grew up in Lima, just two blocks from the old Carnegie Library.

She gave her first public performance there, playing the chimes, when she was ten years old. Phyllis graduated from Central High School in the Class of 1935. She attended Sherwood Music School in Chicago before entering Bluffton College. She married Sherwood Diller in 1939, and he encouraged her career in comedy—often being the butt of her many jokes as “Fang.” Diller debuted performing at San Francisco’s Purple Onion and played Carnegie Hall. In addition to her comedy, Ms. Diller was an artist and also a serious musician, having given solo performances as a concert pianist. She was considered a pioneer in the world of female comediennes with a career that spanned over 50 years. She wrote several best-selling books and appeared in numerous films and television shows.\n\n2/2/1921 – 7/1/2020\n\nHugh Downs was born in Akron, Ohio on February 2, 1921.

He originally started school at Bluffton College in 1939 and left shortly after due to receiving a job as an announcer at Lima’s WBLY radio station (later known as WLOK), earning $7.50 a week. Soon Downs left Lima for a job at Detroit’s WWJ and later went to Chicago’s NBS television affiliate, where he was an announcer for the children’s program The Kukla, Fran, & Ollie Show. In 1954 he moved to New York, where he hosted the talk show The Home Show with Arlene Francis all while playing sidekick to Jack Paar on what was to become The Tonight Show in the same year. From 1971 to 1977 he spent time traveling and writing, and in 1976 he came back to television to host the PBS Over Easy series, followed two years later by ABC’s 20/20, which continues to be a staple on television since it began in 1978. Hugh Down’s career spanned decades, and he started some of the most influential commercial television series to date.\n\n8/9/1911 – 3/14/1995\n\nOur Nobel laureate in physics was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to John M. and Jennie Watson Fowler. The Fowlers moved to Lima, Ohio, in 1913, and Bill attended Horace Mann School across the street from his 901 N. Jameson Street home. He was the president of Central High School’s Class of 1929, and he also played on Central’s football team. Fowler received a degree in engineering physics from the Ohio State University. He then enrolled in graduate school at Cal Tech, where, after receiving further degrees, he remained affiliated with their W.K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory in Pasadena. His major contribution to the field of physics consisted of an explanation of how the chemical elements of the universe were formed following the “Big Bang.” In essence, he said, “We are all stardust.” In addition to the Nobel Prize in Physics, which he received in 1983, Fowler received numerous other awards, including France’s Legion d’Honneur in 1989 and the United States National Medal of Science in 1974.\n\n9/2/1880 – 9/14/1968\n\nAlfred Joseph Frueh was born on Main Street, Lima, Ohio, on September 2, 1880.

There he was, turning Pitman Shorthand symbols into the faces of his teacher and friends. He farmed and worked for his father’s Lima Brewing Co. until 1903, when he left Lima to attend the St. Louis Post Dispatch School of Newspaper Art from 1904–1908, earning himself $6 per week. His work graced their editorial page from 1905 on. In 1907, his editorial cartoon of a music-hall star attracted notoriety, when she was angry enough to cancel her St. Louis performance. In the following years, he spent time in various European capitals (including studying with Henri Matisse in Paris) and worked for Pulitzer’s New York World. Frueh helped launch The New Yorker in 1925 with two cartoons in the first issue and even one on the cover! He remained with them, where he became famous for his caricatures of theatrical personalities as well as for his political commentary, until 1962.

Coming from a musical family, she got her break in her late teens filling in for her sister (who had gotten married) singing with Fostoria’s Jimmy Richards’ dance band. Richards’ tour took them to New York City, where Helen O’Connell was “discovered” by Jimmy Dorsey and hired to sing with his band. In fact, she popularized some of their biggest hits, such as “Green Eyes” and “Tangerine.” After her music career, she became a television celebrity and beauty-pageant hostess, and even went back on the road to sing her old standbys with another “big band” and with the “4 girls 4” act.

He was born to Stanley and Resa Copus Peltier. As a youth, Peltier was given a book on the stars for Christmas, and by age sixteen, he had become so interested in stargazing that he picked 900 quarts of strawberries to earn $18 to purchase a two-inch telescope. Peltier may not have finished high school, but he perfected his craft as a draftsman by charting the stars, especially noting the variable ones. His careful reporting of his avocation led scientists at Harvard and Princeton Universities to loan him larger professional instruments. He built a small observatory on his Scott’s Crossing farm, where on May 14, 1936 he discovered a new comet that would be named in his honor. Later, Peltier obtained an 1868 observatory from Miami University, which he set up near his Delphos home. Eventually, Peltier would discover and or co-discover twelve comets and two stars while developing products to patent for his employer, the Delphos Bending Co. (a toy factory). The self-educated farm boy­ — an expert in history, mineralogy, natural history and astronomy — authored three books before his death on May 10, 1980.\n\n4/4/1904 – 4/30/1973\n\nAlthough he was born in Chicago in 1904, Vice-Admiral Taylor always returned to his hometown of Lima for visits.

During World War II, Taylor commanded the destroyer USS Duncan, which torpedoed the Japanese cruiser Furataka before it sank in the Battle of Cape Esperance. During his military career, Taylor received the Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Legion of Merit. At his retirement, he was commander of the U.S. Navy Fifth Naval District. Previous assignments in his career include the Atlantic Anti-Submarine Force, Guantanamo Naval Base, and the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Force. Vice Admiral served as Chief of Information for the Navy and Aide to Naval Secretary Forrestal. Edmund Battelle Taylor died on April 30, 1973.\n\n1/29/1920 – 3/14/2002\n\nSergeant Major of the U.S. Army (ret.) Leon L. Van Autreve was born in Eckloo, Belgium, on January 29, 1920. He came to America with his parents, Antonine L. and Gabrielle Martens Van Autreve, and siblings Edgar and Mary Josie in October of the same year. Both parents were originally French, and the senior Mr. Van Autreve had been much-decorated for valor in WWI. The family first went to Montana then came to Delphos, Ohio, where they lived at 203 E. Second Street, and both parents became naturalized citizens. Leon graduated from Delphos-Jefferson High School and Ohio Northern University. Following graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 and served as a demolition specialist during the invasion of Africa in World War II. He remained overseas until 1945 and later served tours in Germany; Ft. Knox, KY; Indonesia; Ft. Belvoir, VA; Korea; Vietnam, where he was command Sergeant Major (CSM) of the 20th Engineer Brigade; and finally as CSM in Alaska. Van Autreve served as an advisor to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and he retired in 1975 after 32 years of service, thus ending his career as the highest-ranking non-commissioned officer in the United States Army. During his career he received numerous medals, including the Distinguished Service Medal through the Fouregerre of Belgium.\n\n1849 – 9/13/1939\n\nJohn W. Van Dyke, nicknamed the “Dean of the Oil Industry,” was not an Allen County native, but he spent 16 years living in Lima after establishing the Solar Refining Company here. Van Dyke was born about 1850 in Mercersburg, PA, and when he was young, he ran away to work in the oil fields in western Pennsylvania. He became associated with Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company in the early 1880’s and came to Allen County in 1886, when he was sent here to build and operate a refinery to utilize the newly developed Lima crude oil. Here he worked with Herman Frasch on the desulfurization of Atlantic Refining Co., which was then a unit of Standard Oil, where he eventually became chairman and president of its board of directors. He was known for designing the tank car and the first modern service station in Pittsburgh, PA. Van Dyke was also involved in other refining companies, railroads, shipbuilding companies, and more. Van Dyke died on September 13, 1939."
