        "text": "Dr. Andrew S. Erickson is Professor of Strategy (tenured full professor) in the U.S. Naval War College (NWC)’s China Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI). A core founding member, he helped establish CMSI and stand it up officially in 2006, and has played an integral role in its development; from 2021–23 he served as Research Director. Erickson is currently a Visiting Scholar in full-time residence at Harvard University’s John King Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, where he has been an Associate in Research since 2008. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Institute of Maritime Policy & Strategy’s International Advisory Committee, and the Japan America Navy Friendship Association (JANAFA)-Newport’s Board of Directors. Erickson serves on the editorial boards of Naval War College Review and Asia Policy.\n\nErickson helped initiate, and was part of, the original ‘China Maritime Studies Group’ that approached NWC’s Provost in fall 2004 with the idea of creating CMSI. Following the NWC President’s approval, the Provost established CMSI within the Center for Naval Warfare Studies’ Strategic Research Department on 1 October 2004. Erickson helped draft the above-core issue paper for NWC’s submission to Program Objective Memorandum (POM)08 that secured the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO)’s personal approval to inaugurate CMSI formally and sufficient funding to hire four additional faculty during FY 2008. On 1 October 2006, CMSI was launched in accordance with POM08 decisions by the CNO. In April 2008, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Robert Gates invoked CMSI as a model for the Minerva Research Initiative. By December 2008, CMSI held four influential conferences, with edited volumes following for each. These included CMSI’s leadoff cornerstone event, “China’s Future Nuclear Submarine Force” (26–27 October 2005). Among CMSI’s early publications, Chinese Mine Warfare pioneered the validation of open-source methodology, and remains a formative study in the field. CMSI inspired the creation of other analytical centers, which Erickson has advised and supported; he is a China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) Associate.\n\nIn 2024 Erickson was awarded the Navy Superior Civilian Service Medal. In 2017 he received NWC’s inaugural Civilian Faculty Research Excellence Award. In 2012 the National Bureau of Asian Research awarded Erickson the inaugural Ellis Joffe Prize for PLA Studies; he subsequently served on the selection committee. His publications have won various awards, including the NWC Foundation’s Hugh G. Nott Prize (first & second place), the U.S. Naval Institute General Prize Essay Contest (third prize), and repeated recognition by the Center for International Maritime Security (CIMSEC).\n\nErickson has taught courses at NWC and Yonsei University. He provides flag officer tailored education for NWC, both on and off campus; including in Honolulu, Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Naples. He advises and evaluates a wide range of student research, theses, and professional development at NWC, Harvard, and other institutions. Erickson contributes curricular instruction, inputs, and guidance to NWC, across the Naval University System, and beyond; particularly in support of SECDEF’s guidance for professional military education regarding China. In 2013, while deployed in the Pacific as a Naval Postgraduate School Regional Security Education Program scholar aboard the flagship aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, Erickson delivered twenty-five hours of lectures. He has also accompanied an allied military air patrol in East Asia. Erickson is coauthor of the Oxford Bibliography (Oxford University Press) on “The People’s Liberation Army (PLA).”\n\nFor two decades, Erickson has supported NWC’s scholarly research relationship with Japanese counterparts. In 2014 he helped to escort the Commander of China’s Navy and his delegation on a visit to Harvard. He subsequently helped to establish, escort the first iteration of, and further assist NWC’s first bilateral naval officer exchange program and field studies class in China. Erickson was a scholar escort on a five-member congressional trip to China in 2011. He participates in a range of Track 1, 1.5, and 2 discussions, including as a delegate at the Shangri-La Dialogue; and has joined delegations sponsored by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nFrom 2022–24 Erickson was a Visiting Professor in Harvard’s Department of Government, within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. During 2019–22 he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard’s Fairbank Center. From 2012–17 Erickson was an expert contributor to the Wall Street Journal’s China Real Time Report (中国实时报), for which he authored/coauthored thirty-eight articles. Erickson was the 2010–11 Princeton-Harvard China and the World Program Fellow in residence at Harvard’s Center for Government and International Studies. From 2008–11 he was a Fellow in the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations’ Public Intellectuals Program. In 2005–06, he was a Research Fellow sponsored by the late longtime director of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, Andrew Marshall.\n\nErickson presents at academic, private sector, and government institutions throughout the United States and Asia. He has broadened his knowledge by attending four Zhuhai Airshows, editing newsletters for a hedge fund, and speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Erickson has briefed a broad array of senior U.S. and foreign policy-makers and principals. Within the U.S. Navy: the CNO and Executive Panel, the Secretary of the Navy, and leaders throughout the Indo-Pacific. Elsewhere in government: the National Security Council’s Deputy National Security Advisor, Senior Director for Asia, China/Taiwan Directors, and Chief of Staff; Ambassador to China and other Executive Branch officials; SECDEF; Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Air Force Chief of Staff; Marine Corps and Coast Guard Commandants; other agency heads; and many Members of Congress. Internationally: numerous high-level officials, including heads of multiple foreign navies and other government organizations. Additionally: the National Academies’ Naval Studies Board.\n\nErickson testifies before such congressional bodies as the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees and U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. He has provided inputs for, and reviews of, multifarious government programs, wargaming/simulations, and reports; including in support of the National Intelligence Council’s Global Trends study and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Annual Report to Congress on China’s Military Power. Erickson’s research, presentations, and recommendations are consumed widely by key principals and have influenced specific aspects of U.S. and allied government military doctrine as well as civilian, military, and interagency assessments, policy, messaging guidance, statements, and actions.\n\nErickson received his Ph.D. and M.A. in politics from Princeton University (concentrations: China/comparative politics, international relations) and graduated magna cum laude from Amherst College (majors: history, political science; international relations certificate). He took many courses at The Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA); studied Mandarin in the Princeton in Beijing program at Beijing Normal University’s College of Chinese Language and Culture; and studied Japanese language, politics, and economics in the year-long Associated Kyoto Program at Doshisha University.\n\nErickson previously worked for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as a Chinese translator and technical analyst. He gained early experience interning at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, Consulate in Hong Kong, Peace Corps Headquarters, Senate, and White House. Beijing internship experiences included delivering documents for Colin Powell and climbing the Great Wall with Joe Biden. Erickson has traveled across the Indo-Pacific, from key features, waters, and airspace to China’s Zhongnanhai leadership compound, multiple nations’ military bases near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and remote hinterlands of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. He enjoys exploring strategic islands, e.g., Kinmen and Matsu’s Beigan and Nangan. Proficient in Mandarin Chinese and conversant in Japanese, he has lived and performed academic work in China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nErickson’s research focuses on Indo-Asia-Pacific defense, international relations, technology, and resource issues. He has envisioned, developed, and led a pathbreaking decade-long project to uncover China’s critically important but insufficiently understood Maritime Militia; his coauthored China Maritime Report No. 1—China’s Third Sea Force inaugurated a series of papers exploring topics of emergent interest. Erickson’s coauthored CMSI Note 1—“Admiral Hu to the Helm” initiates a series of timely analyses of recent PRC maritime events. Erickson has published chapters in numerous English- and Chinese-language edited volumes, including the two-part Fairbank Center “China Questions” series (Harvard University Press, 2018; and The China Questions 2: Critical Insights into U.S.-China Relations, 2022).\n\nErickson’s work has been published in such peer-reviewed journals as International Security, Journal of Strategic Studies, Orbis, Technology in Society, Acta Astronautica, Asian Security, China Quarterly, Journal of Contemporary China, The China Journal, and Journal of Chinese Political Science. It has also appeared in Foreign Affairs, The Washington Quarterly, The National Interest, Foreign Policy, Joint Force Quarterly, War on the Rocks, IHS Jane’s, Geopolitics of Energy, Global Health Governance, RSIS Commentary, IISS Strategic Dossier, Harvard Asia Quarterly, and Peking University’s China International Strategy Review and International & Strategic Studies Report. Erickson has published annotated translations of several Chinese articles on maritime strategy.\n\nErickson’s coauthored Foreign Affairs print article, “Competition with China Can Save the Planet,” has been read widely in U.S. and Asian policy circles. His National Interest article “Breaking Down the Pentagon’s 2020 China Military Power Report” received over 150,000 page views in its first 24 hours online. “China Reveals Two ‘Carrier-Killer’ Missiles” garnered 65,000 page views within the first day of its publication in The National Interest. Erickson’s RealClearDefense piece “What Sort of Navy America Needs” registered 60,000 page views in its first day of posting.\n\nErickson is the author of the book Chinese Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile Development (Jamestown Foundation/Brookings Institution Press, 2013). He is coauthor of two other books: Gulf of Aden Anti-Piracy and China’s Maritime Commons Presence (Jamestown/Brookings, 2015) and Assessing China’s Cruise Missile Ambitions (National Defense University Press, 2014). He has coauthored four additional volumes: Charting China’s International Security Activism (Center for a New American Security, 2015), the CMSI monographs Chinese Antipiracy Operations in the Gulf of Aden (2013) and Chinese Mine Warfare (2009), and the CASI monograph The PLAAF’s Campaign for a Bigger Maritime Role (2019). Erickson is the editor of, and a contributor to, three volumes: Maritime Gray Zone Operations (Routledge Cass Series: Naval Policy & History, 2022/paperback 2024), Chinese Naval Shipbuilding (Naval Institute Press/NIP, 2016/paperback 2023), and Proceedings of the 47th History Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics (Univelt, 2015). He is coeditor of, and a contributor to, twelve volumes. This includes eight (in addition to Chinese Naval Shipbuilding) of the nine “Studies in Chinese Maritime Development” books to date, for which he is the series editor; comprising the NIP volumes China’s Maritime Gray Zone Operations (2019/Japanese translation 2020/paperback 2023/Taiwan Defense Ministry translation 2023), Chinese Aerospace Power (2011), China, the U.S., and 21st Century Sea Power (2010/China Ocean Press translation 2014), China Goes to Sea (2009/China Ocean Press translation 2015/paperback 2021), China’s Energy Strategy (2008/China Ocean Press translation 2015), and China’s Future Nuclear Submarine Force (2007/China Ocean Press translation 2015); as well as the forthcoming NWC Press books Chinese Amphibious Warfare: Prospects for a Cross-Strait Invasion (summer 2024), Chinese Undersea Warfare: Development, Capabilities, Trends, and Going Global? China’s Naval Transformation. It also includes Basing and Forward Presence in the Asia-Pacific (NIP, 2014/paperback August 2024), the CMSI volume China’s Near Seas Combat Capabilities (2014), and the NWC Newport Paper China’s Nuclear Force Modernization (2005).\n\nErickson’s work has been cited widely in scholarly publications and reports from the U.S. government and think tanks such as CSIS and RAND. He tweets via @AndrewSErickson and is listed among The China Studies Twitterati 50. Erickson is co-founder of China SignPost™ 洞察中国 <www.chinasignpost.com>, an analytic portal covering key PRC-related developments; particularly natural resource, technology, industry, and trade issues; he has coauthored 94 reports. Analyses have anticipated policy options regarding Beijing’s coercive envelopment of Hong Kong (#102), limitations in the implementation and efficacy of Xi-era reforms (#81), China’s 2015 stock market slump (#89), and a long-run S-curved slowdown in China’s economic growth rate and overall development trajectory (#44).

He combines technical sophistication, great language skills, diligent research, and a keen understanding of which military policy issues and debates matter most. In my recent book-writing on the subject with Jim Steinberg, I have found Andrew’s work extraordinarily sophisticated and helpful.”\n\n—Dr. Michael O’Hanlon, Senior Fellow, Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence; Director of Research, Foreign Policy Program; Brookings Institution\n\n“Your insights and contributions to the national debate once again prove the wisdom of the decision to establish the China Maritime Studies Institute at the Naval War College.”\n\n—Prof. Craig H. Allen, Judson Falknor Professor of Law, University of Washington Law School\n\n“In the 10 years or so that I’ve attended and presented at domestic and international undersea defense conferences; including those at Sydney, Cannes, Hamburg, Glasgow and London; anytime the subject of Chinese naval power came up, so did the name of Andrew Erickson—undisputably one of the world’s foremost experts in this area.”\n\n—Capt. James Patton, USN (Ret.), Owner, Submarine Tactics & Technology, Inc.\n\n“Andrew’s edited volume on Chinese Aerospace Power is one of the most important books on air and space power I’ve ever read. I’m delighted that he has doubled down on his expertise with the equally important history of Chinese statesman and their effective use of airpower. With his combined talents of linguist, researcher and airpower historian, Andrew is leading the way in his field. Please go to his website, www.andrewerickson.com, and you’ll find insights you won’t find elsewhere!”\n\n—Col. Walter J. Boyne, USAF (Ret.), National Aviation Hall of Fame honoree and former director of the National Air and Space Museum; author of Beyond the Wild Blue: A History of the U.S. Air Force, 1947-2007\n\n“My sincere thanks for your advice, your guidance and your support over the last five years.”\n\n–James Barker, First Secretary – Foreign and Security Policy, British Embassy Beijing\n\n“I met Andrew at Harvard five years ago when I was Associate Director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. Andrew’s research and ideas were of great interest to our associated faculty. He regularly was invited to speak to our colloquia. He continues to be invited by Harvard to join other specialists to talk about issues concerning China. China’s naval modernization and the military implications for all other navies, especially for the United States, is a topic we frequently asked him to speak about. But his research extends from that point to also consider the strategic geo-political aspects of China’s naval development. Because of that his audiences are as likely to include scholars of diplomacy and recent history, as well as military experts. At Harvard we noticed that members of the diplomatic community were often in attendance.”\n\n—Dr. Ronald Suleski, Professor of History and Director, Rosenberg Institute for East Asian Studies, Suffolk University\n\nFor further assessments of Andrew and his work, see his recommendations on LinkedIn.\n\nPhilippe Rogers Chief of Staff at U.S. Military Delegation to NATO, NATO HQ, Brussels, Belgium; Senior Marine at NATO\n\n\"I wanted to take the time to write a recommendation for Dr. Andrew Erickson, PhD, who is a Professor of Strategy at the U.S. Naval War College and an Associate in Research at the Harvard Fairbank Center. Dr. Erickson's elective class \"China's National Security\" and his mentorship while I was at the Naval War College for an academic year were the highlights in a year filled with them. I was - with great luck, fortune, and tons of guidance - the recipient of the distinguished honor graduate award for the War College class and received several writing awards; the only reason why I write this is to give context to the following statement: Andrew's class and his mentorship in helping me get articles published in the Joint Forces Quarterly and The Naval War College Review were the highlights in an incredible year of my life. \"China's National Security\" was the best class I took all that year - thought-provoking, mind broadening, and of great current event-related immediacy. The depth and breadth of topics we covered in one too-short course, and the discussions we had in a class of 20-plus from all services and interagency entities, armed me with the potential to talk to everything from China's history to its modernization and global-strategic objectives. There has not been a week since I left that course that I have not used the information I garnered from this elective. Subsequent to the course, Dr. Erickson continued to mentor me and helped shepherd my series of writings on China-related subjects (Chinese UN peacekeeping operations and Chinese influence in Africa) into articles that were published in the abovementioned magazines. These articles, in turn, led to me testifying to Congress on Capitol Hill to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He has continued to provide me with guidance and mentorship over the years - a great unexpected benefit. I not only established a vital lifelong academic link with Dr. Erickson but a lifelong friend. I cannot recommend this course and his tutelage enough. Colonel Philippe \"Boz\" Rogers USMC\"\n\nJimmy Kan Wang International Engagement at U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Operations\n\n\"My name is Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Wang. I am a Navy Foreign Area Officer at U.S. Pacific Fleet (PACFLT), where I am the China Desk Officer. I am writing to let everyone know that Andrew is one of the very best assets that the Naval War College (NWC) is fortunate to have. I attended NWC from 2012-2014, and one of the highlights of my time there was being Andrew’s colleague. I worked with the China Maritime Studies Instituted and noticed Andrew to be both a sharp professional and a good teammate. As a Mandarin linguist, I’m extremely impressed at Andrew’s ability to digest a wide range of Chinese-language sources to find fresh insights that have literally been hiding in plain sight. As Andrew always likes to say, “China is usually more transparent in Chinese” and “So much is knowable from Chinese sources.” I reported to PACFLT International Plans and Policy section in 2014, and we read reports and publications from the NWC and CMSI. My colleagues and I find Andrew’s research and inputs to be extremely relevant useful, and we routinely brief his products to our chain of command. We always look forward to opportunities to discuss China and Asia-Pacific security issues with him, and find it particularly helpful when he comes to our offices to brief us. Andrew’s recent research on China’s Maritime Militia is especially innovative and has been particularly useful to the Fleet. His work is a testament to the value of open source research that takes advantage of this surprisingly underappreciated fact. Bottom line, Andrew is a tremendous asset for the Fleet and NWC, and we are immensely grateful to have him with us. \"\n\nChristopher Weuve Naval Analyst at US Department of Defense\n\n\"Andrew and I were collaborators on the faculty of the US Naval War College. During that time I was exceedingly impressed by Andrew's skills, networking ability, energy, productivity, and keen judgment. He combined deep understanding with a willingness to seek out expertise on subjects that were not his specialty, with a goal of both improving his skillset and bringing together disparate knowledge in support of better analysis, then making sure that analysis got out to those who needed to see it. Since I have left the USNWC, Andrew's name has continued to come up in discussion with national security colleagues, with whom he enjoys a first-rate reputation for insight and productivity. He has worked with academics and policymakers, engineers and social scientists, military and civilians. His efforts have been of great benefit to his institution, the US Navy as a whole, and indeed the entire US government. If Andrew did not already exist, we would have to invent him.\"\n\nDoyle Hodges Associate Professor at U.S. Naval War College\n\n\"Andrew is a prolific and insightful scholar who conducts, supports, and encourages research of immediate and urgent practical relevance to maritime and security studies in the Asia-Pacific region. I have had the privilege to interact with him when he visited Princeton University, at conferences of the International Studies Association, and at a conference he organized through the China Maritime Studies Institute on Chinese Naval Shipbuilding. In every case, I have been impressed with the energy, insight and scope of his work, as well as his ability to genuinely listen to and incorporate the knowledge of practitioners (Naval officers, intelligence analysts, and others) into his work. He is a catalyst for research into aspects of Chinese maritime security that are often overlooked. His deep knowledge of both the Chinese defense and security sector and the strategic role of maritime forces makes his work among the most important and accessible being done on the region. If I were to select a single scholar to advise me on the practical and strategic implications of Chinese efforts in the SCS and ECS region, it would be Andrew.\"\n\nBen Lowsen China Advisor at Air Force Checkmate\n\n\"Prof. Andrew Erickson is arguably the world's foremost scholar of contemporary Chinese maritime studies. His work is innovative, highly insightful, and prodigious. He both meets and anticipates the needs of the policy making community within which I work, for example by warning our Navy and Defense leadership of China's Maritime Militia. Any discussion of Pacific naval policy is incomplete without his input. Over the eight years I have known him, he has struck me as a skillful organizer, highly effective communicator, and adept listener. He has my highest possible recommendation as a leader of academic pursuits involving Asia-Pacific security studies.\"\n\nSteven Park Assistant Professor of Intelligence Studies\n\n\"Andrew's analysis is both timely and relevant. I find his products to be enormously useful -- because of his critical insights and strategic considerations. He has substantial credibility as a result of his thorough knowledge and his subject matter expertise. I just recently finished teaching a course on military capabilities and strategies in East Asia. I had students read a number of Andrew's articles in the class -- which were well received and generated useful seminar discussion. I look forward to Andrew's continued work on Asia-Pacific issues. I am confident that he will continue to be a valued leader and contributor to the academic and policy debates on security issues in the Asia-Pacific over the next decade!\"\n\nRob Dahlin Military Professor, Joint Military Operations at U.S. Naval War College\n\n\"Dr. Andrew Erickson is one of the top China experts in the United States. He has had a tremendous influence on the U.S. Navy's understanding of China and the Asia-Pacific region over the years. I first met him while I was a U.S. Navy attaché to Tokyo and accompanied a group of Japanese officers to Newport. Dr. Erickson gave detailed presentations to us, which ensured that we shared the same nuanced, forward-looking understanding of the region. His analytical writings caused many of us Asia-Pacific watchers to reconsider the potential challenges posed by China, as he drew conclusions that others did not at the time. Many of the regional security developments and dynamics that Dr. Erickson was the first scholar to identify and probe in-depth have since become conventional wisdom, but it is important to remember how innovative these ideas were when he first brought them to public attention. Several years later, while I was a student at the U.S. Naval War College, Dr. Erickson taught in most of my Asia-Pacific area of focus electives. He was a superb professor who combined an encyclopedic knowledge of the region with a teaching style that motivated both students new to Asia-Pacific studies and those with existing experience in the region. During subsequent visits to Newport as the Intelligence Officer for Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Japan, I saw that even my Japanese counterparts learned a great deal from Dr. Erickson's presentations. Moreover, they were amazed that he was not only proficient in Mandarin Chinese, but could also communicate with them in Japanese--unlike many American experts on the Asia-Pacific. On every visit, I would specifically seek out Dr. Erickson to learn what he was working on and to discuss how we saw developments concerning China and the broader region. For anyone who is interested in understanding China and the Asia-Pacific, I most strongly recommend reading Dr. Erickson's prolific writings, attending his lectures, or having an in-depth conversation with him. Doing each of these things has greatly benefitted my own career, as well as my understanding of the most important area of the world today. \"\n\nScott Cheney-Peters International Policy Advisor at National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office (NMIO)\n\n\"I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Erickson for the past several years. He is a consummate professional and everything the fleet could want from an academic – approachable, relevant, understandable, and pro-active in engagement. His remains some of the most meaningful and impactful outreach from the Naval War College since my graduation, constantly seeking new ways to not only bring the best of NWC to operators and decision-makers, but to also incorporate insights and participation from across the broader maritime stakeholder community. Through CMSI, his own work has often filled an intellectual void on the pressing maritime security questions of the day. His support of the CMSI conference series also performs the valuable service of catalyzing attention on overlooked or underdeveloped areas of concern and importance for the fleet. This work and outreach is held in the highest regard by colleagues at State and the fellow members of CIMSEC and has established Dr. Erickson as one of the leading experts on Asian naval and maritime security issues. \"\n\nTom Crowell Naval Intelligence Officer Transitioning in Summer 2018\n\n\"I'd spent a considerable amount of time in Japan and the Pacific and was enthused to better understand China by attending Andrew's course and getting to know him. He far exceeded my expectations! His presentations were insightful, clearly based on deep knowledge augmented by clear understanding of culture and language. Andrew was free with his time - we met outside of class to discuss Chinese capabilities and intentions frequently. I was particularly impressed by Andrew's interaction with the international officers in the class. While at the Naval War College, I knew I would leave to become the N2 at CTF-70/CSG-5 - the Navy's forward-deployed strike group in Japan. Not only did I apply that knowledge at CTF-70, but perhaps more importantly, it aided me in a later assignment as the J2 at US Forces, Japan. The credibility I gained from learning from Andrew were indispensable in my interactions with our Japanese allies. Andrew is a superb communicator, educator, and most importantly, an expert. I have enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy and appreciate Andrew's contributions to our national security.\"\n\nRaymond Keledei US Army Civilian Employee\n\n\"Prof. Erickson’s course was one of the highlights of my time as a student at the Naval War College (NWC). He helped me think of the Asia-Pacific in a new way and subsequently benefitted my career by refocusing my eyes to the rising power of China well in advance of the military’s “pivot to the Pacific”. Prior to attending NWC, most of my tactical, operational and strategic career experience had been focused on the Soviet Union followed by the continuing turmoil in the Middle East. China and the Asia-Pacific region were relative backwaters. After graduating from NWC, my next assignment was with the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command. I initially served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Assessments and subsequently as the command’s Chief of Staff. During that assignment, I assessed the U.S. Navy’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) readiness against the nearest peer competitor, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). Prof. Erickson’s insight and experience furthered my understanding of the Chinese and the PLAN and this education directly influenced my contributions to the U.S. Pacific Command’s operational and contingency planning vis-à-vis China. Prof. Erickson’s effectiveness as an instructor is incomparable. I can attest to this not only as one of his students but also as the former Dean of Students at NWC. As the former, I can recall his engaging speaking and presentation skills. As the latter, I read countless student reviews of their professors and Prof. Erickson repeatedly stood head and shoulders above his colleagues for his outstanding courses. One of my strongest memories of Prof. Erickson regarded my research paper. Not only was he highly accessible, he also helped guide me to a topic that resonated and suggested fascinating and relevant readings that made the paper enjoyable to research and write. As both an alumnus and former Dean, I can wholeheartedly write, that having a professor of Andrew Erickson’s intellect, engagement, and enthusiasm is a cornerstone of the worldwide reputation the Naval War College enjoys. When I consider the outstanding education I received at NWC, Prof. Andrew Erickson comes to mind as an exemplar of founding president, Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce’s quote that ,\"The War College is a place of original research on all questions relating to war and to statesmanship connected with war, or the prevention of war.\" \"\n\nBen Purser, PhD DAS in the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation\n\n\"Beyond simple classroom instruction, Andrew has mentored a large number of students in Newport and beyond; I am fortunate to count myself as one of them. Back when I was still a Navy officer and trying to determine how to approach doctoral programs, Andrew mentored me. After gaining entrance to multiple doctoral programs, Andrew mentored me in how to approach determining where to go — and how to manage the initial coursework. In preparing for my (doctoral) comprehensive exams, Andrew mentored me. After passing all of my comps, Andrew mentored me on how to put together a dissertation proposal and committee. While working on that dissertation, Andrew mentored me with respect to publishing, research positions (like the summer one I had there at the Naval War College), and how to ultimately defend that dissertation. In all of those conversations, I not only benefited from Andrew’s patience, kindness, and guidance — I learned of other students who were also benefiting from Andrew’s mentorship. Importantly, those students were spread across the Naval War College, the Navy, and the world. I can attest, first-hand, to how much time and energy Andrew has committed to helping with others’ academic and professional development. Whether he was offering strategic guidance about research topics or tactical suggestions with respect to specific methodological issues, Andrew manifested a proficiency with the entire spectrum of expertise necessary for helping students with research. Beyond that, though, Andrew offered extremely valuable guidance with respect to how I should structure the first courses I got to design for my own students. Moreover, Andrew offered important guidance for how to approach the process of publishing research as well as how to prepare for various academic conferences. Before entering a new phase of academic or professional life, I make it a point to touch base with Andrew; for his continuing guidance, I am extremely appreciative. Now that I am a Professional Staff Member for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have learned to appreciate an entirely different group of people who count on Andrew as a mentor and guide: the Hill staff with whom Andrew takes time to help understand everything from specific elements of Chinese policy to broader maritime patterns or concerns. Ad summum, Andrew’s commitment to mentoring is based firmly in the Naval War College but transcends its walls — helping make him one of the NWC’s greatest assets. \"\n\nTodd Freece Senior Program Manager\n\n\"I was fortunate to be in Professor Erickson’s course on China’s National Security during my time at the Naval War College. He was an interesting and engaging instructor with a tremendous depth of knowledge in the history, culture, national interests, and military organization of China. His course was invaluable in my following assignment to the Pacific Theater where I engaged directly with PLA officers during a short “exchange” tour for US military officers. It helped me to quickly find areas of common understanding and mutual interest when meeting with Chinese military and government officials. While serving as the Vice Commander for the Pacific Air & Space Operations Center, I used the knowledge gained in Professor Erickson’s class to conduct military operations in the Pacific that supported US interests while avoiding unnecessary flash points between US and Chinese military forces. I have and continue to strongly recommend this course to other officers bound for the Naval War College\"\n\nBrenden Kettner Transitioning Veteran\n\n\"I graduated from the Naval War College in May of 2008 and without a doubt, my engagement and interaction with the faculty and my cohort significantly enhanced my understanding and perspective of China and Asia-Pacific issues. Prior to beginning my studies, I had worked across agencies in the Middle East and Horn of Africa area and had personal accounts of Chinese engagement and activities in the region. This experience is what drove me to select China and Asia-Pacific studies as a focus area at the Naval War College. Upon graduation I was assigned as the Coast Guard Deputy Sector Commander to the U.S. Territory of Guam located in the midst of growing Chinese soft power expansion. Professor Erickson was an engaging and knowledgeable educator and was skilled at drawing out the experiences of students and focusing those experiences and questions into teachable moments that supported the main theme of the class. During discussions, he took my experience and wove them into the overall assessment of Chinese influence and was able to use that paint the much larger Chinese strategic objective. There is no doubt that Professor Erickson was skilled at transferring knowledge in his course, but more importantly he demonstrated and shed light on the thought process and cultural influences that shaped and drove strategic moves. In the remote islands of Palau, Yap, and Federated States of Micronesia, the influence of China is pervasive. Professor Erickson’s course was critical in preparing me to see how Chinese soft power as well as hard power influenced the region and to what end the influence was being projected. This translated into our interactions with various U.S. Embassies to advance the policies and objectives of the United States. I have always been very proud to have graduated from the Naval War College. The experience and knowledge has influenced my understanding, assessment and actions even as I transitioned out of the military and into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The education, interaction and experience will always be a part of me. Even following graduation, I was able to reach back to Professor Erickson and the rest of the faculty in the Chinese Asian Pacific program to discuss issues and ideas. I cannot say enough about Professor Erickson’s professionalism and continued support that has significantly continued to my lifelong learning. \"\n\nPJ Tech First Officer, 767 & 757, international at American Airlines\n\n\"Andrew was my first and most influential mentor in studying China and the Asia-Pacific region. His class, China’s Maritime Development (SE 672), designed as a capstone for the East Asia Studies sub-specialty, was the initial impetus to what has become a life-long desire to better understand the cultural and historical influences that directly affect not only China’s maritime development, but its dynamically evolving role in the world. His influence and example made me a better student, a better Foreign Area Officer, a better teacher, and a better Naval Officer. In the classroom, his infectious enthusiasm and sense of humor capture the attention of every student who has the honor of working with him. The profound depth of his subject matter expertise creates an atmosphere in which each clarified point opens an inexhaustible world of new questions and points of research and discussion. His in-depth understanding of maritime security challenges common to our allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region guaranteed foreign counterparts from across the region would exchange views, critically debate central strategic tenets, form friendships, and create lasting networks. Between classes, his generosity with his time complements and reinforces the learning cycle, motivating students and colleagues alike to greater understanding of the topic. While I was writing my research paper, Andrew provided exhaustive research support, offering detailed advice during each stage, and critically reviewing the result, always driving for a deeper analysis and understanding. He makes the subject come alive. As a mentor, colleague, and friend, Andrew has enriched my career. His tireless approach helped me become a more effective teacher in my own right as a Military Professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS). It was always an honor to be able to host him for discussions with our faculty, in which he never failed to provide new perspectives on the Asia-Pacific region. Whether in discussions at APCSS, the East-West Center, PACOM, in China or Taiwan, citing his name and work always invoked recognition and respect. Several times, after an interlocutor had mentioned his work, I was able to elicit reverent awe by mentioning that he was my mentor. His tireless alumni outreach and assiduous maintenance of a vast network of experts and colleagues creates powerful synergies for the Naval War College and the US. \"\n\nRobin Schilling Strategic Planning | Relationship Building | Project Management\n\n\"I had the pleasure of interning alongside Andrew at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. His dedication to his work, his desire to learn and understand everything occurring around him, his ability and willingness to converse with anyone in Chinese (or Japanese or English, of course), as well as his kindness, gentleness, and good heart made him a great colleague, a great traveling companion, and a great friend.\"\n\nDon Jagoe Senior Director, Sales & Business Development, Navy\n\n\"I have been an admirer--and for a short but stellar period of time, his senior manager (at SAIC). Andrew is an undisputed expert in Chinese history, culture, politics and naval strategy and infrastructure. He is widely traveled, has served on numerous panels and been a highlighted expert at innumerable international fora. Moreover, he has provided expert input into extremely high level politico-military games. Andrew is the consummate professional, is a superb colleague and a terrific team member. He has unparalleled communication skills, in writing and orally, in both English and Chinese languages. He was an absolutely superb employee and I've been so very pleased to maintain a friendship. A complete professional.\"\n\nMilton J. Singleton - Global Supply Chain and Emergency Mgmt A driven executive leader with a proven track record of directing global operations and supply chain networks.\n\n\"I had the unique opportunity to participate with PROF Erickson on the first student exchange between the U.S. Naval War College and the People's Liberation Army (Navy) naval staff college in Nanjing. Throughout the week I was continuously impressed with Andrew's incredible depth of knowledge regarding U.S. / Chinese relations and his ability to interact and communicate effortlessly with our Chinese counterparts. During the week long trip which included Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai our group met with senior academics at Chinese universities and think tanks as well as senior officers at PLA(N) headquarters. In Nanjing at the PLA(N) naval staff college our group met with our Chinese counterparts to discuss Chinese and U.S. shared maritime security in the region. Dr. Erickson lead our team flawlessly as its primary speaker, translator and interpreter of U.S. national security policy. I have no doubt that thanks to Andrew our Naval War College delegation made significant headway towards improving understanding between the U.S. and China. Very Respectfully, CAPT Milton J. Singleton, USNR milton.singleton@navy.mil\"\n\nTimothy K. Atmajian, M.D. Medical Director\n\n\"I give my highest recommendation to Prof Andrew Erickson from the US Naval War College. He is an incredible person and professor!!! I had the opportunity to meet Prof Erickson on a one-week intensive trip to China where we participated in relationship building and gained valuable insights into the people and places of China. Books can teach you a great deal, but to experience a place in person is irreplaceable. On our long bus or train rides, I would corner Prof Erickson and we would discuss countless pertinent topics, from politics of China to ethics in Chinese society to understanding the people and places of China and the history behind it. We discussed perspectives in China as well as manners and customs so that we offended none but built relationships with many! Not only does Prof Erickson understand the military and social aspects but he speaks the language fluently; that made our trip much more enjoyable and understandable. Not only did he impact those with him, he also reached out individually so that every member of our group appreciated and was touched by him. Back in Newport after the trip, it is not uncommon to send out an email at any one time and at least half of the group will attend a China group meeting. (The other half only unable because of an exam or class.) In short, Prof Erickson is a most amazing person and I am the better for having been given the opportunity to meet and interact with him and to have been a student at the Naval War College and in the real world of China!\"\n\nJack Hathaway Naval Officer & Test Pilot\n\n\"Prof Erickson recently helped lead an exchange between the US Naval War College and its Chinese counterpart institution in Nanjing, in which I had the honor to participate. His role was absolutely crucial to the trip's success. He maintains an in-depth knowledge of the culture and language of the Chinese people generally and the PLA and PLA(N) specifically. The trip consisted primarily of US military officers becoming more familiar with their counterparts in China, and Andrew's knowledge, personality and understanding of both sides of that interaction was critical to facilitating an effective visit. It is rare to find an individual with the academic talent, technical accumen and penetrating insight to be able to read foreign language open source documents--from techncial data reports to think tank policy arguments--and to connect them in a broad and useful way to people studying and watching Asia-Pacific relations with the US.\"\n\nJohn F Bradford Active Duty Navy Scholar in Tokyo & President, Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies (YCAPS)\n\n\"Dr. Andrew Erickson is a national strategic asset. As a naval officer leading Sailors on ships forward deployed to Asian waters, a policy maker working on the U.S. relationships in the Asia-Pacific, and an amateur academic, I rely heavily on Andrew’s prolific writing. He turns absolutely first-rate academic research into highly readable policy-relevant publications with amazing frequency. I can think of few scholars in the field of Asia-Pacific security that go back to the well to refresh their analysis with new foreign language primary research as consistently as he does. It is not hyperbole when I say that U.S. foreign policy would be less informed and less coherent if it were not for Andrew Erickson.\"\n\nBill Bunn Instructor, Advanced Maritime OPINTEL Course (AMOC) at United States Navy\n\n\"I have been responsible for imparting strategic and operational knowledge of America's potential adversaries to warfighters for over twenty years, and for most of that time, I have turned to Andrew Erickson for analytical expertise and research. Andrew possesses exactly the right attributes and talents at precisely the right time in history. His ability to translate and analyze original source documents, combined with the unprecedented access of such documentation, at a time of upheaval and flux in the Asia-Pacific, makes Andrew \"required reading\" for anyone interested in understanding the region. In particular, his writings on China's aircraft carrier development, anti-ship ballistic missile program, and anti-piracy operations have provided me invaluable insights I could find nowhere else.\"\n\nJessica Weiss Associate Professor at Cornell University\n\n\"Andrew is not only one of the most prolific and insightful scholars of Chinese foreign policy that I know. He is also a gifted teacher. Last year he gave a guest lecture to my course at Yale University on China's military and defense modernization. Students raved about his clear, lively, and approachable introduction to the topic. Through the annual Princeton-Harvard China and the World workshop and National Committee on US-China Relations Public Intellectuals Program, I've had the privilege of interacting with Andrew on a semi-regular basis. Conversations with Andrew are invariably stimulating and informative. He is a real asset to both the academic and broader policy discussions of US-China relations.\"\n\nTom Fargo Chairman, Huntington Ingalls Ind. (HII)\n\n\"Andrew is a valued contributor to our understanding of the PLA Maritime Strategy and Operations. His research and analysis is absolutely top notch and merits our attention.\"\n\nCortez Cooper International Policy Analyst\n\n\"Andrew is a prolific contributor of insightful analysis on Asia-Pacific security issues in general, and China domestic and foreign policy issues specifically. His articles and his blog contributions have proven especially valuable to me for research projects on Chinese military modernization, and the impact of Chinese military capabilities and concepts on regional and global geo-strategic environments.\"\n\nYoichi Kato National Security Correspondent at The Asahi Shimbun\n\n\"He is one of the top China military experts in the United States without doubt. When I interviewed commander of PACOM a few years ago and obtained some new infromation on the development of China's Anti-Ship Ballistic Mmissiles, I contactaed him right away for his evaluation. For me, a Japanese national security correspondent, he is the best source to seek comments on the military capabilites of PLA Navy. I have been closely following his works. I know a lot of fellow journalists in the Asia-Pacific region, who do the same.\"\n\nLloyd Thrall Scholar in Residence and Associate Director, Cybersecurity Program at CU Boulder\n\n\"As evidenced by the remarkable wealth of accolades, publications, and senior recommendations he has generated, Andrew is one of this generation’s foremost thinkers on Pacific geopolitics, security, and seapower. The breadth and depth of Andrew’s work—spanning from global energy geopolitics, naval and joint military strategy, tactical joint warfare, and evolving Chinese security and geopolitical dynamics—is exceptional. The quantity and quality of this research has made Andrew a thought-leader simultaneously in several fields. Andrew’s work is where I, like many, look first for nuanced and forward-leaning insight into this critical and complex region. As stated, all of the above is abundantly clear from a review of Andrew’s research and recommendations. In addition, I would like to add an element perhaps less clear and less directly quantifiable. Andrew has been a fine mentor and guide, helping more junior researchers like myself discover and develop our role in the U.S. national security community. I have known Andrew since 2007, when he gave a week to lead a week-long energy security roundtable for undergraduates. His guidance has since helped me bridge the gap between academia and applied security research and analysis. Both his writings and his openness to junior researchers have helped create the foundational literacy that younger researchers, myself included, have depended upon as we mature as analysts and thinkers. These less tangible effects go beyond the resume-style accolades Andrew has amassed in abundance. Andrew continues to be both a top-tier thought-leader in Asia-Pacific strategic affairs, and a community leader within the U.S. national security sphere. Both roles are of exceptional value.\"\n\nPaul Godwin Independent International Affairs Professional\n\n\"Andrew is without doubt one of the brightest minds to enter the field of Chinese security studies in the past decade and more. Not only are his language skills superb, but he uses these skills to produce clearly written, carefully and exhaustively footnoted, insightful assessments of whatever issue he has chosen to evaluate. Consequently, Andrew's publications are not only respected, but are core reading for all of us working in this particular vineyard. Andrew's analytic skills are not limited to his publications. He is equally valuable at conferences where his intellect, clarity of thought and detailed understanding of the issue at hand add considerably to the quality of discussion and debate. I must add that Andrew's interpersonal skills allow him to present contrary views without offense. These characteristics led his peers to award him the Ellis Joffe Prize in PLA Studies a year ago. In conclusion, I can state I regard Andrew as one of my most valuable colleagues.\"\n\nGuy Snodgrass Chief Executive Officer at Defense Analytics\n\n\"I had the privilege of meeting Andrew while at the U.S. Naval War College. As a service member recently returned from the Asia-Pacific region, I wanted to learn more about the strategic implications of the region. Andrew was the clear frontrunner when I asked college professors for their recommended point of contact and all of my subsequent interactions with him have only reinforced their choice. Andrew is an insightful strategic thinker who remains entirely approachable by students, professors, and staff alike. As a leading Sinologist, we will undoubtedly see more of Andrew as the Asia-Pacific region continues to gain importance.\"\n\nKim YongJae Public Relations Officer — Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat\n\n\"Dr. Andrew Erickson was a brilliant faculty member and also a friendly team member of the UCSD-IGCC 2013 SITC workshop which we attended together. Thanks to the article \"Demystifying China's Defense Spending\" which was co-authored by him, I've known his name already but it was not until this workshop that I could interact with him directly. His kindness, understanding on East Asian Cultures, and academic professionalism helped me to enjoy the whole two weeks of workshop. I have strong confidence that Dr. Andrew Erickson, armed with expertise on China, will provide us abundant knowledge and wisom.\"\n\nKerrie Dougherty curator, educator, author, science communicator\n\n\"Andrew is an expert in Chinese military and policy studies studies, whose language skills have contributed significantly to the Western understanding of Chinese civil and military space activities and their history. Through his ability to study original Chinese language sources otherwise inaccessible to Western researchers, Andrew has, in the past decade, made important contributions to the understanding of Chinese space history with his papers presented at the History of Astronautics symposia held during the International Astronautical Congresses and in other fora. His editorship of the proceedings of the 2013 History of Astronautics Symposium, held in Beijing, will represent a further contribution to our understanding of the background to current Chinese space activites.\"\n\nFrank Hoffman Senior Research Fellow at National Defense University\n\n\"Have been involved with Pacific strategy, Chinese naval modernization, and US strategic interests in the region for some time, and have valued Andrew's research, scholarship, and insights for years.\"\n\nClaire Topal Strategic messaging | High-impact fora | Global Health\n\n\"Andrew is a brilliant, thoughtful, and sincere political scientist with a knack for making the dry details of current political, security, and scientific events fascinating and clear. Andrew contributed a wonderful chapter to an NBR publication on Pandemic Influenza in 2006. He stood out as a highly valuable contributor not only for the quality of his analysis but also for his professionalism, writing skills, project management skills, and graciousness. His contributions to the health security field are significant and worthy of attention.\"\n\nEric Holmes Director, Undersea Warfare Capture Management at L3 Technologies\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is an invaluable national asset due to his understanding and analysis of the People's Republic of China's military capability.

I look forward to his continuing contributions to this and other fields.\"\n\nJohn Shissler Principal Professional Staff at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory\n\n\"I've known Andrew professionally for a number of years. I consider his research to be essential reading for anyone interested in Asian military affairs. His knowledge, insight, and analytic judgement are unsurpassed.\"\n\nBrett Witthoeft --\n\n\"I have known Andrew Erickson since 2010, when he accepted our invitation to appear at our Maritime Security Challenges conference (http://www.mscconference.com/). Andrew did a superior job speaking on the Chinese navy, leading us to broaden our relationship, including hosting me at the US Naval War College to exchange ideas on Canadian and American strategic naval thought. Andrew kindly returned to Maritime Security Challenges in 2012 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFdg4LGZak), where he again delivered excellent insight into Chinese naval developments, but our relationship is greater than conference organization: Andrew has consistently provided timely and relevant information on issues of importance to Maritime Forces Pacific and the Royal Canadian Navy. Indeed, Andrew's research is a cornerstone of my work for the Royal Canadian Navy and Department of National Defence, and is one of the first resources I strongly recommend to Defence coworkers and academic colleagues. I cannot possibly recommend Andrew in higher terms.\"\n\nMohan Malik PROFESSOR IN ASIAN SECURITY at APCSS\n\n\"I have known Dr Andrew Erickson as a fellow China-watcher for more than a decade. I am an avid reader of Andrew’s writings. Andrew enjoys a solid professional reputation and has a wealth of experience in providing intellectual leadership, teaching, and research in the broad disciplines of Chinese Studies, International Relations, and Defense & Security Studies. He is an internationally renowned scholar known for his superb knowledge of and insights into Northeast Asian issues in general and Chinese military affairs in particular. He is held in very high regard by his peers for his scholarship, intellect, analytical abilities and expertise. His writings are widely quoted in mainstream print and electronic media. In fact, in a short span of time, Andrew has established himself as one of the leading analysts on Chinese military-related issues in the United States and the world. His fluency in both Chinese (Mandarin) and Japanese languages gives him an edge over other China and Japan experts. In addition to having an abundance of intellectual horsepower, Andrew is an extremely hard-working, conscientious and thoughtful scholar. Andrew is the author and editor of several important and widely-quoted studies on Chinese military affairs. His published work constitutes a substantial, original, significant and continuing contribution to knowledge on Chinese military capabilities. Much of Dr Erickson’s work is policy relevant and of immense value to scholars and policymakers.\"\n\nMatthew Payne Chief Financial Officer at CPFD\n\n\"I’ve known Andrew to be interested in making an impact on China-US relations since I had the pleasure of knowing him through Princeton in Beijing, which we attended in the summer of 2003. I have subsequently had the opportunity to build a closer friendship with Andrew, including through his involvement in the Harvard Asia Business Club when I was pursuing my MBA at Harvard Business School. In the more than a decade since we first studied Chinese together, I’ve witnessed Andrew’s passion for understanding the more complex themes that shape US-China relations and now fully appreciate why his chosen area of research and education is so important to fostering understanding between the two countries. From my perspective as an interested reader of Andrew’s publications and a friend with substantial business experience in the U.S., China, and the Asia-Pacific, the unique value Andrew brings to his field is his ability to combine detailed and rigorous academic research with a highly personable and sincere approach to building relations with people that is greatly facilitated by his cultural skills and sensitivity. If the relations between the US and China as countries stand to be influenced ultimately by real relationships between Chinese and Americans —as opposed to only policy and politics, particularly at higher levels—I believe Andrew is among the few people who will have the capability to achieve this through the mediums of research and scholarship, building cross-border relations among public and private institutions, and demonstrating a strong determination and capacity for understanding and navigating deeper cultural issues. Andrew is an ambassador in the fullest sense and someone who will help lead the way forward into the new era of the China-US relationship.\"\n\nAlanna Krolikowski Assistant Professor of Political Science, Missouri S&T\n\n\"Dr. Erickson is an unparalleled academic authority on China's naval and air-force modernization and large-scale technology development programs. His articles, books, and online contributions are invaluable resources for any specialist or generalist studying contemporary China and its security relations with the United States or the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, Dr. Erickson's research makes effective and transparent use of primary sources in Mandarin. This feature sets it apart from other work on these topics. I have frequently cited Dr. Erickson's scholarship in my work. In my own experience, Dr. Erickson is a supportive colleague and mentor to junior scholars and students.

Specifically, he has made significant contributions in the fields of Chinese aerospace and naval research. Andrew's work has become invaluable to individuals studying Chinese military and Chinese security policy for the incisive research and analysis apparent in each of his publications. His incredible publication record reflects his commitment to expand knowledge on and promote discourse of China and Asia. Andrew is well known for his savvy in investigating under-utilized credible sources to delineate critical trends that have great implications on U.S.-China relations and U.S. military posture. As someone who has had the pleasure to work with Andrew in various capacities, I can testify to his nuanced knowledge of trends in Chinese military development and U.S.-Asia relations. Andrew continually pushes the boundaries of U.S. scholarship on China and Asia. Andrew also possesses sharp insight as a manager and practitioner who works well with individuals of all backgrounds and experience levels. Andrew is generous with his time and endeavors to promote greater understanding of China through his interactions with scholars, policymakers, businesses, and service members. The analytic community is lucky to have an individual with such capacity and potential contributing to this field.\"\n\nKenneth Lee Asian Equities\n\n\"Andrew's publications and insights on China SignPost have consistently been a unique source on topical issues in China.

I’ve also been fortunate to collaborate with him on a handful of scholarly activities, including our joint interest in America’s defense strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. We’ve co-written and published several articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Asian Security and the Naval Institute Proceedings. Andrew and I have known each other since 2001, when we were both graduate students at Princeton University. At that time, Andrew was a Ph.D. candidate in the Politics Department, and I was an MPA student at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Over the course of his doctoral studies, Andrew took six courses at the Woodrow Wilson School, and we took several of those courses together. Andrew has a deep appreciation for the curriculum and mission of professional schools of international affairs, especially members of APSIA. He is a passionate and articulate teacher, and his perspectives have had profound impact on impact on me throughout my career in the military and government. He has influenced my work at U.S. Central Command and at the Pentagon, where I was a speechwriter for Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. On his frequent visits to Washington, he always made time to educate me on his current research and ideas. He often presented his latest findings to senior military officers and civilian officials throughout the Department of Defense and the broader policy community. He is familiar with the full range of U.S. government institutions, and he has become one of the most influential and trusted sources of information and analysis on U.S.-China relations, Asia-Pacific affairs, and Chinese military culture and development. I can attest that he has helped shape defense policy speeches on the Asia-Pacific region, including Secretary Panetta’s remarks at the Asia Security Summit known as the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. I have often called Andrew for his perspective and assessments during my time in government, and he has provided his honest counsel without any political agenda.

His publications are well-argued, insightful, and impactful and always uncover new information or present known information in a new light. He has a strong record of providing policy relevant analysis that provides a nuanced view of the many complex problems associated with China’s rise as a global power. This is aided by Andrew’s superb Chinese language speaking and reading skills. Long gone are the days in which China analysis could be done without knowing Chinese. Andrew’s language abilities not only give him the ability to exploit Chinese language sources accurately and with ease but also to discuss and develop a rapport with interlocutors and to develop relationships that lend even more depth to his analysis. Andrew’s analytical ability is matched by his undying work ethic. His energy and enthusiasm for studying China is seemingly boundless. He is relentless in his pursuit of knowledge and publishes over a wide range of venues. This includes scholarly peer-reviewed journals, books and manuscripts, news outlets, the internet and social media. Like no one else I know, Andrew demonstrates the ability to reach multiple audiences, from those in academia to high level government officials to a broader public and the wider China-watching audience around the world. And I would be remiss if I were to neglect Andrew’s great interpersonal skills and friendly demeanor. He is able to interact effectively with a wide range of personalities, including experts, government officials, business people, and colleagues. Andrew is thus not only well-respected in his community, but is also able to establish long-term relationships that act as a “force multiplier” for his analytical efforts. In sum, Andrew possesses the universe of skills that make him a valuable and trusted China scholar who produces some of the finest analysis of issues relevant to US national security.\"\n\nJohn Campion Politcal Science Instructor at United States Naval Academy\n\n\"Andrew Erickson's teaching and mentoring have been instrumental to my development as a naval officer. Andrew has helped me cultivate the tools I need to grow into an important actor in the Sino-American maritime relationship. As a midshipman at the US Naval Academy, I grew increasingly interested in Sino-American maritime affairs. As this interest grew, numerous professors recommended that I become familiar Andrew's work. I frequently read articles written by Andrew and also attended guest lectures he gave at the Naval Academy. As I wrote my honors thesis on using maritime cooperation as a mechanism for avoiding great-power conflict, I reached out to Andrew and asked him to serve as an adviser for my thesis. While thesis advisers are generally only Naval Academy professors, Andrew eagerly agreed to advise me. He provided invaluable insight and editing of my work. I received the 2010 Naval Intelligence Foundation Award, given to the midshipman of the graduating class who has the highest level of academic achievement among those students participating in the honors program. I largely credit this distinction to Andrew's assistance. Andrew continued to mentor me throughout my graduate education. Andrew's recommendation of the Peking University-London School of Economics joint masters in International Affairs was pivotal in my decision to enroll in this program and allowed me to study under such influential Chinese scholars as Wang Jisi, Zhu Feng, and Pan Wei. Andrew continued to advise me on the two theses I wrote for this program, the first on the development of Chinese naval diplomacy and the latter on the London Naval Declaration of 1909. As a naval nuclear submarine officer, I continue to rely on Andrew to remain informed on Sino-American maritime affairs. While my current career focus is on becoming a proficient nuclear operator, Andrew's regular e-mails and the articles he posts on his website provide me with the impetus to continue to think critically about Sino-American maritime affairs. Continuing to monitor China's naval development under Andrew's guidance ensures that I will be a better informed officer down the line when I am called upon to play a larger role in Sino-American relations. Andrew's tutelage has been critical to my development as a naval officer. Andrew's expertise in international relations, maritime history, and naval technology has helped me not only become more knowledgeable about these matters but has also helped me develop the tools I need to frame the questions I ask and the results I find in my research on these topics. While Andrew's knowledge on Sino-American maritime affairs is unrivaled, I am most grateful for the time and energy he has devoted to my development. While I am still only a junior officer in the Navy, Andrew has consistently taken time out of his busy schedule to mentor me. I know that I am not the only one to receive this attention, and I truly value this effort.\"\n\nScott Truver Director, TeamBlue National Security Programs, Gryphon Technologies LC\n\n\"Andrew is a highly skilled and experienced research-analyst, broadly focused on international relations and national security affairs, but specializing in Chinese military/naval subjects. In that he is world class. We have collaborated on Chinese Navy research focusing on comparative USN/PLAN mine warfare capabilities. He is very articulate in speaking and writing. I cannot recommend him more highly.\"\n\nWalter Ladwig Assistant Professor (UK: Lecturer) of International Relations at King's College London\n\n\"I have known Andrew for more than a decade, dating back to our days as graduate students in Princeton. Even while he was a PhD student, Andrew demonstrated an ability to combine rigorous analysis with attention to policy-relevant conclusions—equally at home in the Politics Department and the Woodrow Wilson School. As an academic he has carried these twin imperatives into his scholarly work which is notable for both its rigor and its sheer volume. Andrew’s reputation as one of the foremost analysts of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)—particularly naval issues—is well established here in the UK: my own graduate students and colleagues who study the Chinese military frequently reference his writings in their own work. Having collaborated with Andrew on several articles and book chapters, I can also say that he is an affable and diligent colleague who not only brings out the best in other’s work, he is a genuine pleasure to work with. In short, Andrew is the kind of prodigious scholar and engaging personality that everyone wants in their department. If I thought I could woo him away from the Naval War College, I would….\"\n\nDrew Thompson Senior Research Scientist at CNA Corporation\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is a prolific author who has made valuable contributions to our understandings of China’s maritime strategy and naval modernization. His products are consistently of a very high-quality reflecting his exacting methodology and analytical rigor.\"\n\nBenjamin Armstrong Assistant Professor at United States Naval Academy\n\n\"Dr. Erickson's work is widely consumed in military and government circles because of his expert knowledge and analysis. On a personal level, his willingness to engage with junior members of the policy and naval analysis community sets him apart in helping to encourage future generations of analysts and officers.\"\n\nDr. Marc S. Aviation industry executive | Business school academic\n\n\"It is my absolute pleasure to write on Andrew's behalf. I have known Andrew since both of us spent a year at Harvard during the academic year 2010-2011. At the time, I had decided to take an academic leave from the aviation industry where I had served most recently as Senior Vice President, Airlines Operations Solutions, at Lufthansa Systems, the IT services business segment of Lufthansa Group. Andrew is an absolutely first rate scholar who distinguishes himself by virtue of his deep domain knowledge across an extraordinarily broad range of issues in Chinese and Asian-Pacific affairs, his ability to deep dive into arcane empirical details and to maintain a view for broader theoretical and strategic themes at the same time, his extraordinary scholarly productivity, his knack for translating academic research for the benefit of a broader audience, and his talent for identifying and communicating policy-relevant aspects of his research. Equally important, Andrew is an exemplary mentor of younger scholars who gives generously of his time to help younger colleagues and students develop their own research and professional careers. At Harvard, Andrew has gone far beyond the call of duty in terms of supporting the \"Harvard Asia Quarterly\", an academic journal of Asian studies which is affiliated with the Harvard University Asia Center and advised by its Director, Professor Arthur Kleinman, and for which I had the pleasure of serving as Deputy Editor-in-Chief. As a former industry executive, I would like to highlight Andrew's extraordinarily impressive interest in and grasp of technical details and developments that is rarely found outside industry and that inform and distinguish Andrew's research and policy recommendations. Last but certainly not least, Andrew is a true team player with whom it is a true pleasure to collaborate and whose outstanding track record as a scholar, mentor, and policy advisor has not affected his sense of humility and groundedness. I consider myself fortunate to have had - and to continue having - the opportunity to work with and learn from Andrew.\"\n\nTobias Harris Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence\n\n\"I have followed Andrew's work on the Chinese military for several years now. He is an indispensable source of analysis on China's military modernization and one of the first stops I make when trying to understand its regional consequences.\"\n\nVernon Bashaw Research Staff Member at Institute for Defense Analyses\n\n\"I first met Andrew while studying at the Naval War college, and have benefited from his insightful writings and analysis in a series of positions afterwards, including as the Seventh Fleet N2. Andrew's work is indispensable to anyone following the Chinese military particularly Chinese naval developments. I would not hesitate to say that the information Andrew derives from public sources would cost millions if it had to be obtained by intelligence means.\"\n\nPeter Dutton Professor and Director, China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is quite simply one of the very finest scholars of Chinese and Asian security affairs active in the field today. Every day I rely on his insights and thoughtful analysis to deepen my own understanding of China-related security matters, as do many of America’s most senior officials and scholars. Andrew has an extraordinary track record of publication across a range of China-related disciplines, including security affairs, international relations, Asian studies, and economics. Each publication presents highly sophisticated, policy-influential research and his writings often set the agenda for the development of US-China and Asia-Pacific policies. In particular, in the field of the national security implications of China’s aerospace development, Andrew has no peer. Andrew’s research often represents the first serious work on a given subject and sometimes challenges conventional wisdom. He is repeatedly the first to recognize and analyze critical developments in an era in which the rapidity of Chinese technology and weapons advancements surprises the vast majority of scholars and analysts. His work on the development and deployment of a Chinese an anti-ship ballistic missile and Chinese mine warfare capabilities are both definitive and authoritative. He wrote the first-ever scholarly analysis of China’s space event support ships and associated tracking infrastructure, the most advanced, comprehensive analysis to date on Chinese aero-engines. Andrew is an outstanding colleague and team member. He played an integral role in the founding and development of the China Maritime Studies Institute, assuming collaborative leadership over many of the Institute’s key functions. He has been especially instrumental in demonstrating the research value of electronic databases, developing and applying innovative analytical methodologies, and selecting and acquiring Chinese-language books, periodicals, and newspapers. Andrew possesses highly sophisticated Chinese (Mandarin) language skills and a working knowledge of Japanese. These skills enable Andrew to develop and maintain valuable relations with a wide range of academics, officials, and public intellectuals throughout Asia, allowing Andrew to develop insights from an ‘insider’s’ point of view. Andrew is an experienced educator in a wide range of venues. At the Naval War College he co-taught two courses: China’s Maritime Development, and China’s National Security. He leads groups of mid-career professionals in the University of California Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation’s annual summer studies of innovation and technology in China. Andrew is the consummate professional scholar and educator whose extraordinary portfolio of accomplishments demonstrates his deep dedication to producing the highest quality China-related national security research. His professionalism, collegiality, and work ethic make it a pleasure to work with him.\"\n\nCourtney J. Fung Assistant Professor of International Relations at The University of Hong Kong\n\n\"I turn to Andrew's webpage to read his of-the-minute analyses of China's security issues. Always succinct and clear in his treatment of contentious matters, Andrew's writings are an excellent resource for researchers of contemporary Chinese security and defense affairs.\"\n\nThomas Henderschedt Naval Attache at U.S. Embassy Beijing\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is THE authoritative open-source voice on the PLA Navy and Chinese maritime strategies, perspectives, and developments. As a former military attaché in Beijing, and still very much involved in issues regarding the PRC, I eagerly read every paper that Andrew publishes, and consider every blog entry he pens. While not always in agreement, I am always thankful that Andrew works with such energy and passion, possesses such objectivity on his areas of expertise, and utilizes such broad and deep resources. He is the academic with whom I discuss my theories and thoughts on PRC maritime issues. I have known Andrew for several years, and can say from very direct experience, that his research is not only consumed by the US security establishment, but the academic community also regards his work as authoritative, all-encompassing, and unprecedented. He is the recognized expert on Chinese maritime matters in and outside of the Navy, and possesses enviable worldwide contacts that serve to broaden his perspective and facilitate his novel views. I do not provide endorsements on this site; Andrew is the exception. If you want to understand developments in China you must follow his work. His finger is on the pulse of China’s maritime developments. Simply stated, he is the best!\"\n\nStanley Weeks Adjunct Professor, U.S. Naval War College\n\n\"Andrew is an exceptionally knowledgeable and insightful analyst of China and its security and military development--indeed, I consider him among the top four young China analysts in the United States and globally. He is unusually skilled in focusing on the key analytic issues, and articulating them clearly and concisely. Andrew is a national asset for US security policy.\"\n\nJean Hyun DPhil Candidate at the University of Oxford\n\n\"I had the pleasure of getting to know Andrew at Harvard. Not only is Andrew one of the foremost experts in Asia-Pacific security, but better yet, he is also an excellent communicator who can discuss complex research issues clearly and impressively in multiple languages. Authoritative as he is accessible, Andrew was a great mentor and active contributor to intellectual life at Harvard.\"\n\nKabir Sehgal Author, Banker, Record Producer\n\n\"Andrew is a leading light in understanding the most pressing security issues facing the US. He is an expert on China/Asia-Pacific security, and is able to marshal his knowledge to inform and advise policy makers and investors alike to make better decisions. Andrew is diligent, assiduous, and brilliant.\"\n\nAlan Park SaaS Entrepreneur and Co-Founder at Enux\n\n\"I have been fortunate to know Andrew for almost 10 years now, ever since first meeting Andrew at a conference on US-China relations. Even back then, it was obvious that he was a rising star who had amazing insight into East Asia, along with an incredible ability to bring people together under a common goal. Even so, what he has accomplished since then boggles my mind. His prolific, ground breaking, and insightful scholarship on East Asia is a go to resource for thinkers and policy-makers who are serious about China. His deep knowledge of Chinese culture and language enables him to infuse his work with original research, perspective, and insights which can't be found anywhere else. As someone involved in Chinese language education, I also admire his tremendous prowess in developing his online presence through influential medial channels like China Signpost. Andrew is already an influencer of the influencers and I am excited to see his next steps.\"\n\nchris heber Pilot at US Air Force\n\n\"I have known Dr. Erickson for several years. He is one of the preeminent scholars working on Chinese military capabilities and intentions, and what this means for both the Northeast Asian region and the world as a whole. Critically, Dr. Erickson’s work bridges the gap often present between the theoretical and practical, making him a relevant and oft-cited source for today’s military leaders and policy makers.\"\n\nKristen Gunness CEO at Vantage Point Asia, LLC\n\n\"Andrew's work on Chinese maritime and security issues has been some of the most well-researched and informed work in the field. Given the high quality of his analysis, I often selected his research papers and academic articles to send to the Chief of Naval Operations and other navy leaders to inform their perspective on China. Andrew's work has greatly contributed to the Navy's and DOD's understanding of China's maritime issues and military modernization programs. I would not hesitate to recommend him or his work to anyone who wants an in-depth, thoughtful, and well-researched perspective on these issues.\"\n\nJason Yuki Osuga U.S. Naval Attaché to Japan\n\n\"Professor Erickson is extremely dedicated to training and mentoring the next generation of Naval Officers through his passion to teach various disciplines in the maritime, security, and Science & Technology realms. As an academic, Andrew never spins the facts to fit any one agenda. His knowledge base spans the whole of the Asia-Pacific region, and across many functional domains. His analysis is cogent, timely, and piercing. Andrew is a true asset to the Naval War College, US Navy, the Defense establishment, and the national security think-tanks worldwide.\"\n\nJune Teufel Dreyer Professor at University of Miami\n\n\"Like Dr. Erickson, I have an interest in the Chinese military. His work in this area is consistently of the highest quality: well-informed, astute analysis, and objective in tone. The work that Dr. Erickson and his colleagues at the Naval War College's Maritime Studies Institute is invaluable for those engaged in policymaking\"\n\nGabriel Collins Baker Botts Fellow in Energy & Environmental Regulatory Affairs, Baker Institute for Public Policy -- Rice University\n\n\"I've known Andrew since 2001: first as a fellow Chinese-language student at Princeton and Beijing Normal University, then as a Research Fellow helping Andrew at the Naval War College from 2006-08, and most recently as a coauthor on numerous publications and co-founder of China SignPost, a research newsletter that we've published together since 2010. Andrew is a superb China scholar and a well-respected rising star--not just in the U.S., but in the global China and Asia-Pacific studies community as well. He has a keen intellect, strong language skills, and deep intercultural understanding. His analytic work reflects a powerful desire to seek the truth and apply it to help craft practical solutions to pressing, complex problems. Deeply incisive in his scholarly approach, Andrew identifies the key issues very rapidly in even the most complicated situations, then applies his unparalleled work ethic. The result is that his scholarly range is broad, but he can also dive deep on a wide spectrum of important subjects. I have seen no other China scholar who is able to do this; Andrew's one-of-a-kind capabilities set his work apart. His prolific research consistently embraces and shows the multidisciplinary impact China's growth and development have on myriad U.S. and global interests. Andrew also has an exceedingly rare trait for someone with a top-caliber scholarly mind: he is a superb organizer. With a strong track record of bringing people together for international China conferences, educational exchanges, and other activities, Andrew executes such events in top-notch fashion--even when balancing these efforts with a consistently prodigious research workload. The same applies to his classroom skills. For several years now, he has taught well-regarded courses to U.S. and international officers at the Naval War College and advised countless student research projects in Newport, Cambridge, Washington, and beyond--despite shouldering a research and organizational load that few others could sustain. Finally, Andrew has a unique ability to interact effectively with a wide range of officials, experts, and businesspeople across the Asia-Pacific, individuals who all too often do not communicate consistently or effectively among themselves. His earnest pursuit of empirically-grounded scholarship, coupled with his deep respect for people regardless of their background, culture, or politics, make him a trusted interlocutor for both the U.S. government decision-makers who rely on his counsel and the Asian officials and professionals--including those in China and its military--who likewise seek to discuss important matters with him. For anyone needing a leader who can produce first-class China scholarship while serving simultaneously as a cornerstone of classroom and curricular activities and an effective organizer and credible convener of major events, Andrew is absolutely my first choice. He should be yours as well.\"\n\nJoel Wuthnow Research Fellow at National Defense University\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is a remarkably prolific and talented scholar of Chinese security and defense issues. He has made valuable contributions both in the academy and in public policy discussions. His research is particularly impressive because he utilizes a broad range of often overlooked Chinese language sources and is able to distill them for both specialist and generalist audiences. I would recommend his research and teaching skills without reservations.\"\n\nDavid A. Deptula Dean, Mitchell Institute for Aerospace studies\n\n\"As a leader, strategist, commander, and scholar of airpower, I have participated in, and watched developments in Asia-Pacific closely, with the most authoritative sources at my disposal. As China continues to have a profound military-political impact in that domain, I know of no scholar offering better analysis on the subject than Dr. Andrew Erickson. In my current efforts, I value Andrew's work using Chinese-language open sources for its cutting-edge insights on Chinese aerospace developments and perspectives, which are simply unequaled elsewhere. Andrew's path-breaking study on Chinese statesmen and their use of airpower explains how Beijing's leaders have finally assembled a wide range of increasingly-capable air assets to support their statecraft. Andrew's just-published book on Chinese ASBM development contains a particularly valuable chapter documenting the PLA's rapid progress in building an advanced C4ISR network to support its operations. I endorsed his edited volume on Chinese Aerospace Power as a \"must read,\" and I commend him to you now as the foremost scholar on Chinese aerospace development.\"\n\nAbraham Denmark Director of the Asia Program at The Wilson Center\n\n\"Andrew is outstanding researcher and analyst, and is one of America's leading experts on China's military. A prolific and highly talented writer, Andrew's body of work has already made several important contributions to the acadmiec community and has provided important insights to American strategists and policymakers focused on China. For his outstanding contributions to the understanding of China’s military, Andrew was elected by representatives of the Chinese seucirty studies community to receive the inaugural 2012 Ellis Joffe Prize for PLA Studies. The prize honors the memory of Ellis Joffe, a founding figure in the study of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and recognizes a rising scholar who has enhanced the field of China security studies and who demonstrates Dr. Joffe’s traits of grace and civility. Dr. Erickson distinguished himself by the volume and quality of his work, signaling a promising future in PLA studies. Andrew is an extraordinary talent and a highly valued leader in the Chinese security studies community. He has my strongest recommendation.\"\n\nJoshua H. Ho Head of HR, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine\n\n\"Andrew has always been very prolific in his publishing of and interpretation of the military activities and force development plans of the PLA and especially of the PLAN. His analysis is insightful and is always referred to as primary material when writing or speaking about the PLAN. In terms of the names of scholars who you would refer to for expert opinion on the PLAN, his would be the first few names that would come to mind as well. He will definitely be or if not already is a leading scholar of the Chinese Military and its Navy in particular.\"\n\nGary Sampson Ph.D. Candidate, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy\n\n\"I knew Andrew by reputation years before I had the pleasure of meeting him in person. While I was a full-time graduate student at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Andrew's research and scholarship concerning the Chinese anti-ship ballistic missile was instrumental in my own master's degree research efforts. His works were the highest quality, most abundant source for reputable information about the DF-21D which I referenced as I wrote my master's thesis focused on China's anti-access and area denial (A2AD) capabilities. Later, when I found myself at the Naval War College for a brief visit, he took time out of his busy schedule to meet with me and talk about China. Not just a reputable and formidable scholar on Chinese weapons systems, defense and security issues, and East Asia in general, he is also a true gentleman. While my current graduate research into the Chinese nuclear weapons program has diverged somewhat from the A2AD realm, I find earlier scholarship by Andrew about Chinese nuclear systems to be helpful aids once again. I recommend Andrew wholeheartedly and without reservation.\"\n\nHans Kristensen Director, Nuclear Information Project at Federation of American Scientists\n\n\"Andrew is an outstanding analyst and resource for understanding Chinese defense programs and developments, policy, and related security issues. His productivity and professionalism are highly impressive.\"\n\nJan van Tol Senior Fellow at CSBA\n\n\"Andrew is extraordinary researcher and prolific writer on defense and national security issues pertaining to China as well as to the Asia-Pacific region more generally. His work on the evolution of the PLA Navy and other military forces continues to be cutting edge, and is tremendously useful both for military professionals and for others working in the national security/defense communities. Much official work in these areas is necessarily classified, so what makes Andrew’s open source research especially valuable is that his writings present very thorough, highly detailed analysis of important trends, issues, and challenges pertaining to the US-China relationship, including the military balance in the Western Pacific, to inform a wide range of audiences having diverse interests in how that relationship evolves. I recommend him most enthuastically!\"\n\nTimothy Heath Senior International Defense Research Analyst at RAND Corporation\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is without question one of the top experts in the field of PLA studies. I value Andrew's analysis and expertise when conducting my own research. His articles and books are insightful, thoughtful, and timely.\"\n\nJoshua Rovner Associate Professor\n\n\"Andrew Erickson was a terrific colleague when we worked together at the U.S. Naval War College. He was always willing to reach out across disciplinary and departmental lines in order to seek out other researchers. Andrew is a diligent scholar and a serious analyst of Chinese strategy and defense politics. I recommend him without reservation.\"\n\nBryan McGrath Managing Director, The FerryBridge Group\n\n\"Andrew Erickson is the preeminent scholar on the capability and capacity of the People's Liberation Army.
