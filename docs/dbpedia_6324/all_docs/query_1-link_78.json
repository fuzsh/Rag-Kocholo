        "text": "I'll preface all this by saying that I wasn't around yet when the full-game categories/rules were established, nor did I become a mod until after my 100% run, so Auaora probably has a more informed opinion on the matter than I do.\n\nThe StrategyWiki guide is an amazing resource, especially for 100% planning, but it isn't fully accurate (at least one optional quest is listed as mandatory, and the listed bug/fish locations failed me a few times when I went for 100%).\n\nI don't personally know if it's possible to complete every single quest and/or collect every accessory in the game in one playthrough (maybe you or somebody else does!). When routing 100% I had some trouble getting locked out of quests before I could get the required items, but that could have been just because I was approaching it with the Any% route in mind. I don't know if every single accessory is obtainable during one playthrough, or if it'd require radical re-routing due to having to save Woofs by not using Boris as often, or what.\n\n100% Scents might indeed be a more accurate name for the existing category, but as it stands, relatively few quests go unanswered during the course of a 100% Scents run (mostly the Circus quest line). The accessories seem to be the distinguishing factor, and I don't know how much research has gone into them other than the StrategyWiki guide, which includes the line \"Each type of animal in each area has a different accessory, and will drop an item 10% of the time, on average.\" If accurate, that kind of RNG is abysmal and would likely add hours of tedium on top of a category that's already ~6+ hours to begin with. Take it from me; fishing RNG is quite bad enough!\n\nI guess my tl;dr opinion is that the 100% (Scents) category is likely to remain as is, and a \"true\" 100% category would require so much additional research and ask so much of runners that it's unlikely to be implemented among our relatively-small community. I wouldn't personally be opposed to renaming the existing category \"100% Scents\" for clarity.\n\nAll that said, I'm absolutely willing to hear what others think about such an idea.\n\nGetting all accessories should be \"possible\" - it's something I believe a friend of mine has already done - but it's very tedious. The \"stunnable enemies drop accessories at a low rate\" thing is painfully true. Every individual enemy type will drop a different accessory per area (so every green snake in Green Meadows will drop the same accessory, I think it's a hat, but green snakes in Treely Woods drop a different one, as do boars and bear in Green Meadows). I think you have to charge your bark/howl fully to get the item too. Also remember the combination accessories from Malshige's.\n\nThere's limited accessory storage between your inventory and the treasure chest, so you probably can't have them all at once. You'd have to start tossing them once you get too many. I don't think this was something you were meant to do and the game certainly doesn't give you a way to keep track of it- if we get a true 100% category, then I'd say don't bother with accessories.\n\nAs for quests, there are some odd ones - a set that depend on gender (date with Amalia/Camu/McCoy) and the one with Henry's special painting (Hans will ask for it from you- if you say no, then that chef guy will ask for it instead). But I don't think there should be anything stopping you from completing them all if you pick them up at the right time...? Except the date for the gender you didn't pick. Petriform is right, though, that 100% scents and a true 100% would be very similar.\n\nI agree that changing the name to 100% scents is a good idea, both for clarity and accuracy.\n\nEDIT: Speaking of, if we ever do need to do more research on this kind of thing, said friend who got all the accessories would probably be very happy to help. She loves this game to death and did actually do a speedrun at some point, although she didn't submit it. I will have to keep this in mind\n\nI'm working on some information gathering stuff for the any% at the moment, but when that's done I'll see how close to 100% I can get.\n\nI have a feeling that the quests that change based on factors are considered the same quest? I haven't done them in a long time though, will check that when I can get around to it. Even if not, I'd say you pick the faster of the mutually-exclusive quests and call it \"99%\" or something silly like that.\n\nAnd Winter_Doggo, if your friend wants to look into this stuff before I can: by all means! (and of course no pressure :>)\n\nAs for accessories, considering video proof is required, storing all accessories at once probably doesn't need to be.\n\nAnd finally I suppose it should be asked if you should need to hand in items to the collectors? Although I'm suggesting this half jokingly because it would be a massive pain, it's still... t e c h n i c a l l y a thing you can complete.\n\nSince I'm currently working on 100% scents and it's been a while, I thought I'd provide updated thoughts on this.\n\nFirst, a correction: you don't actually have limited box space, at least to an extent that it would be a problem here. This was a misconception I had bevause I'd never actually used the box for more than a few items - but in one of Remo's older videos she has more than a dozen box pages full of stuff, so space is probably never going to be an issue.\n\nIn terms of a true 100%, I think the conditions should be something like this:\n\nComplete every quest/diary entry\n\nLearn every scent\n\nComplete the collector's books\n\nI still believe that accessories should not count towards a true 100%, because to me they don't feel like a \"completable\" thing, just a fun dress-up extra. By these rules, the main distinguishing factor would be the collectors - you need to not only get the items, but safely deliver them back to Pupsville. This makes most death warps a very big risk and not nearly as useful. Personally, I've always seen the collectors as part of completing the game, and I was surprised at first to see them not involved in 100% in any way (although that'd be because that category was what became 100% scents).\n\nSpeaking of diary entries, I would be interested in seeing an All Diary Entries category where you have to complete every quest. Someone mentioned this in the discord a while back and I actually really liked the idea - I do believe it to be possible, and I also think it could be an interesting category. It'd be a bit like 100% scents, but without having to worry nearly as much about RNG (which is most of the battle there).\n\nAlthough obviously, there's not any kind of rush on a decision :p I've got no shortage of stuff to work on in this game atm\n\nOh that's a good point on the crafting accessories- almost forgot about those. I'd be fine with those being part of 100%. After all, it is unlockable stuff you can complete. I wouldn't feel the same way about enemy accessories, though - the only difference between those and other accessories is the method of obtaining. Crafted accessories do at least have a list to whittle down, but enemy accessories are just... you scare the enemy and get lucky, you get the accessory. You don't unlock it in shops after that or anything, so I feel like I'd only include those if we're including every accessory in the game. (Slightly related, previously I mentioned that I thought you had to charge up your howl fully to get the accessory- I have since discovered this to not be true, and have recently got an enemy accessory from a half-charged bark, although I'm not sure if this affects the chances of getting the item.)\n\nI get your point on if these rules would make things too unfun. On the other hand, if we ever were to make true 100%, I don't think we should skip out on something that people agree counts as part of completion ...And I do just really like giving to the collectors to be honest, although that isn't really a good reason hah"
