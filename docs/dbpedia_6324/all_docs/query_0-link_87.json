This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\n\nFeatured in this article\n\nThe Switch is one of Nintendo's most successful and influential systems ever. There’s something unique about carrying a home-console-quality gaming device everywhere you go. Figuring out what to play, though—that's getting harder every year, as the roster of first-party and indie games grows deeper and deeper.\n\nThankfully, WIRED has plenty of opinionated Nintendo fans on staff, and we've put our heads together to compile a list of the best Switch games. We've listed the digital version for most of them here, so make sure you get a spacious microSD card to store all your game files. (We recommend this one.)\n\nBe sure to also read up on our Switch Tips and Secrets and Favorite Switch Accessories. And if you upgraded to an OLED Switch, here's how to transfer all of your data.\n\nUpdated June 2024: We've added Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Princess Peach: Showtime, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, and removed some older games.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off).
