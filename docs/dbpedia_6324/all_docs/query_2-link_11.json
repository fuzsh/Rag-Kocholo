        "text": "Ubisoft Sofia started operations in 2006 with a modest team of 11 pioneers and their journey began with smaller-scale projects and platform ports. Fast forward to today, Ubisoft Sofia has rapidly ascended to the ranks of a world-class AAA game development studio and it is now boasting a diverse team of 220+ experts. By 2024, Ubisoft Sofia has 22 games in their portfolio. Since 2012, they've tackled sprawling AAA open-world titles for almost all latest gaming platforms and technologies. The creative prowess and technical expertise of the team have left an indelible mark on iconic franchises like Assassin’s Creed®, Tom Clancy’s®, and Prince of Persia®. Ubisoft Sofia is a key contributor to the Assassin’s Creed series. As a co-dev studio, they've been instrumental in bringing to life acclaimed titles such as Black Flag, Origins, Valhalla, Mirage, and now Shadows. The Bulgarian team has led the production of six standout projects in the series' 17-year history, including Liberation, Rogue, Origin’s mythological DLC \"The Curse of the Pharaohs\", the ambitious AC Valhalla \"Dawn of Ragnarök\", and most recently Assassin’s Creed Mirage for iPhone and iPad.\n\nHere’s a list of our Studio’s projects throughout the years:"
