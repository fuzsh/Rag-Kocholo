The console supported both CD-ROM and DVD-ROM formats, with its games distributed on silver discs for DVDs and blue discs for CDs. It offered various peripherals, including the DualShock 2 controller, light guns, and dance pads, catering to a wide range of gaming experiences. Despite its eventual discontinuation in 2013, the PS2's legacy continues to reverberate through the gaming industry, leaving an indelible mark on both gamers and developers alike."
