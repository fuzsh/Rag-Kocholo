Meet Striker, the attacker recruit, and Sentry, the defender recruit, who will be unlocked for all players and in all modes, including Ranked. All Battle Pass owners will receive an Operator Voucher that they can redeem for any Operator. Year 9 Season 2 also brings the new Rainbow Six Siege Membership which gives players a monthly drop of exclusive content and full access to the Battle Pass. In addition, Operator balance updates for Fenrir and Solis as well as the Siege Marketplace full release, and a Map preset feature will be introduced.",

        "text": "BALANCING\n\nFENRIR\n\nFenrir now has 4 F-NATT Dread Mines, 2 tickets to activate mines, and the mines are no longer bulletproof. Tickets are recovered when a mine is destroyed or deactivated. Barbed Wire has also been replaced with Observation Blocker.\n\nSOLIS\n\nSolis' SPEC-IO Electro Sensor is unavailable during the prep phase, duration of the sensor has been reduced to 10 seconds, detection range is now set to 12 meters, and must be at full charge to use. Impact Grenades have also been replaced with Proximity Alarm.\n\nBARBED WIRE\n\nDeals 5hp damage every second while moving through it.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nEnjoy access to a voucher that can be redeemed for any operator and over 100 rewards from the Premium Battle Pass along with 10 level skips each month for quicker progression. Legendary, member-exclusive gear awaits you every month and are only available for a limited time. We are showing our appreciation to early adopters with extra bonus rewards! Become a member before June 19th to get an additional Ash epic bundle and 600 R6 credits.\n\nActive R6S Membership owners receive: Premium Battle Pass access during each R6S season, 1 Exclusive Legendary Item (Collect 1 item per month during a season to complete a full Legendary Set), 1 Exclusive Cosmetic Bundle per month, 1 Bravo Pack per month, and 10 Battle Token per month.\n\nLearn more\n\nOPERATOR VOUCHER\n\nFor Season 2 and Season 4 of Year 9, players with the Premium Battle Pass will be given an Operator Voucher that can be used to unlock any operator they want. At the end of the season, unused Operator Vouchers will be automatically used to unlock a random Operator that the player doesn't own, and if a player has unlocked all Operators, they will instead receive R6 Credits.\n\nMARKETPLACE\n\nOn June 25th, players who are at least clearance level 25 and have Two-Factor Authentication enabled will have access to the Rainbow 6 Siege Marketplace, a safe and anonymous web platform for players to securely trade skins with R6 Credits. Players without access can play a match that grants XP to verify eligibility. Ubisoft account sanctions or in-game sanctions will affect Marketplace access.\n\nNew life improvement features also coming to the Marketplace, such as : Item recommendations, Price History, Graphs and other UX/UI improvements.\n\nGO TO MARKETPLACE\n\nPLAYLIST\n\nSTANDARD PLAYLIST MAP FILTER\n\nThe Standard Map Filters provide a way for players to have some degree of agency when it comes to map selection while playing Standard.\n\nThe Standard Map Filters consists of:\n\nRanked Map Pool (all maps currently in the Ranked Map Pool)\n\nNon-Ranked Map Pool (all maps currently NOT in the Ranked Map Pool)\n\nAll Maps (all maps in the Ranked and Non-Ranked Map Pool)\n\nOnce a filter is selected by the player, every time they start a queue for a Standard Match they will be queuing only for the selected maps. Settings can be found in the Settings Menu for Standard.\n\nNEW ATTRITION ARCADE\n\nPrepare to adapt and outwit in Attrition. Attrition returns to Siege as a tweaked, limited-time event. In this bomb mode, once an operator is chosen, it’s locked for both teams for the match. Players must adapt and strategize with unconventional team compositions to win. The match starts with 5 Defender and 5 Attacker Operators randomly removed from the pool at the beginning of the match, giving both sides a random handicap.\n\nAttrition will be available from June 18th to July 2nd.\n\nMAP UPDATES: STADIUM ALPHA AND STADIUM BRAVO\n\nStadium Alpha and Stadium Bravo were given some quality of life changes that will make the maps more competitive. Across both maps, bulletproof glass has been removed. The layouts and destructibility for both maps has also been changed to improve player comfort and navigation, and provide more of a challenge for Attackers. Both Stadium maps will be included in all rest of playlists: Standard (with the new filter system), Quick Match (with correspondent preseteups), as well as Arcade and Custom Game.\n\nPLAYER COMFORT\n\nADVANCED AUDIO OPTIONS\n\nAudio options have been updated to provide a deeper level of control over the soundscape of the game. The feature will give more comprehensive and granular audio customization options to the player, including voiceover and music. Players will be able to fine tune their experience of a variety of audio elements in-game to better suit their own playstyle and needs. Previous audio settings have been reverted to default to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nFLASHBANG CUSTOMIZATION\n\nThe new flashbang customization feature allows players to select the type of visual and audio effect applied whenever the player is blinded by a flashbang or other blinding device. The purpose of the feature is to improve accessibility of the game and make the blinding effect less taxing on people with photosensitivity and tinnitus.\n\nTRAINING AND ONBOARDING\n\nVERSUS AI\n\nFor Y9S2, Versus AI playlist has been updated with some new additions.\n\nNew Maps\n\nCoastline\n\nNighthaven Labs\n\nNew AI Operators\n\nVigil\n\nThunderbird\n\nNew Playable Operators\n\nAce\n\nBlackbeard\n\nHibana\n\nDeimos\n\nNew Behaviour\n\nAI Operators may wallbang against red pinged players, especially Deimos. Advanced difficulty only.\n\nMAP TRAINING PLAYLIST\n\nMap training playlist has added a new mode called Endless Drill to help you warm up and sharpen your skills before hopping into matchmaking. Run 60 minute sessions to train your aim while navigating a map and getting important feedback such as how much damage you took during the run.\n\nNew settings have also been added to the map training playlist. Maps can now be set up with soft walls pre-destroyed, a headshot only mode, and the option for a simplified objective HUD.\n\nTo help players better understand important sections of the map, we've added a guidance tool. Players can set markers for stairs, drone vents, and hatches to better familiarize themselves with the map and improve their tactics.\n\nEndless Drill now has 4 new maps: Outback, Villa, Kanal, and Thempark.\n\nSEASONAL WEAPON SKIN\n\nCracked and battered, yet still standing tall, the Fracture Bundle is here to show it withstood adversity. Get your hands on the Shattering Point weapon and attachment skin, the Mark of Six charm, as well as the Duality operator card background. The seasonal weapon skin will be released at season launch and is available for purchase throughout the season. Once unlocked, it remains in your inventory indefinitely and can be applied to all available weapons."
