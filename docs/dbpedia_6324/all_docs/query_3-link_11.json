I believe the video only played like half of the beginning intro and then at the end of the video, a disturbing and kinda disgusting looking baby popped up (with a scream but i think i had the sound off on that video). The baby's face honestly looked a bit like a yellowish stained soccer ball (complete with a soccer ball pattern), i don't know if it's even still up on youtube now but i was just curious if anybody else remembers ever watching that exact video!\n\nP.S I think the video was uploaded sometime between 2007-2009?\n\nby the way here's a screenshot from the games intro"
