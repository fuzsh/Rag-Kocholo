If yes, they can keep them forever.\n\nExactly my problem, you're buying a shortcut on Steam essentially with these games with other launchers.\n\nIf it's not a native steam port, it's likely cheaper and less complicated to just buy direct on the launcher they were originally made for.\n\njetsetrez\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,050\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#28\n\nThen I will consider buying them roughly a year and two months after they release (for them to get put on the platform I want to use and for them to be discounted, because I'm not going to wait all that time and still give them their full asking price).\n\nThankfully Ubisoft very rarely makes anything I find remotely appealing anymore, but I would've bought the new Price of Persia if it were on Steam, and I'd probably be interested in whatever Splinter Cell they're working on. But if they want to treat me like a second class customer I will treat their products like second tier games not deserving of full price.\n\nGenesius\n\nNov 2, 2018\n\n16,875\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#29\n\nConsidering how quickly their games lose value, I am curious how they'll price them.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\ndex3108\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n23,507\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#30\n\nThose dumbasses still refuse to implement achievements for their steam releases.\n\nTheir point is to make experience bad for Steam users so users would go and buy on Connect.\n\nNameless\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n15,855\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#31\n\nWhile I'd love everything from everyone Day 1 on Steam , Ubi isn't a huge loss for me. If it isn't Splinter Cell, Far Cry 2 style Far Cry or maybe The Division, I probably wouldn't play it until a deep, deep discount years down the line anyway(if at all). We'll see about Outlaws.\n\nI would, however, pony up the $15 for Ubisoft+ for any of those at launch, so their release strategy is working as intended. Idk, though, $70 upfront sounds better to me than a month sub + discounted sale a year or more after release. .\n\nGavalanche\n\nProphet of Regret\n\nOct 21, 2021\n\n20,158\n\nRoshin\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n2,892\n\nSweden\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#33\n\nI would argue that these games are not actually on Steam.

I can't think of many companies that can overcome the gap by selling on their own store. Certainly not Ubisoft.\n\nCheapJi\n\nApr 24, 2018\n\n2,837\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#43\n\ncan't believe a new pop is releasing in 2025.

I would have rebought AC Valhalla complete on day 1.\n\nAs it is, I'm pretty sure I'm done buying their shit until this business strategy changes.\n\nFlappy Pannus\n\nFeb 14, 2019\n\n2,386\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#47\n\nThere's little point to buying them on Steam if they're still going to launch through Ubisoft Connect.\n\nExactly my thought when I see a 'game has finally launched on Steam' announcement. So often it means 'We put an icon for our game on Steam so you can launch our launcher from Steam's launcher now'. Wee.\n\nTheMadTitan\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n27,977\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#48\n\nThere's little point to buying them on Steam if they're still going to launch through Ubisoft Connect.\n\nGuides and in-launcher/in-game message boards are pretty big reasons, especially on a Steam Deck where you can get even more by slapping in a browser and shortcuts to outside sites. Not everyone plays at a desk and not everyone -- me, this part is me since I'm exclusively in BPM when I play games -- wants to alt-tab all the time once they're in game mode.\n\nCosmiKu\n\nJul 9, 2023\n\n1,119\n\nWales\n\nMar 9, 2024\n\n#49\n\nMost of Ubisoft's games have the same boring gameplay, so getting last year's game is like getting this year's game with a different skin.\n\nNo big loss to wait a year for their slop.\n\nLast edited: Mar 9, 2024"
