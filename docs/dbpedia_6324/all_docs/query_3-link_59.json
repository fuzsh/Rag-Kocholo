The game was released exclusively in Japan. It was followed up by a 2007 adventure game, The Dog Island.[7] In 2009, the series also released a pet simulation game on mobile phones and smart phones.[8] In 2016, they were featured as themes for the Japanese Nintendo 3DS home menu.[9]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
