        "text": "Ubisoft is a massive company. According to its own data, the video game publishing giant owns over 45 development studios and employs over 20,000 people — significantly more than competitors such as EA — though Ubisoft is reportedly dealing with an exodus of talent.\n\nDespite its ongoing struggles, Ubisoft continues to focus on producing new entries in its stable of established franchises — Assassin’s Creed, Tom Clancy, and Far Cry, to name a few — while intermittently experimenting with new franchises like Immortals Fenyx Rising and Riders Republic. It’s a one-two punch that makes Ubisoft and its development decisions interesting to follow, even if those experiments don’t always pan out.\n\nTo give you a better idea of the company’s current production pipeline, we’ve created this list of every Ubisoft game we know to be in development for consoles and PC. (Rumored projects and mobile games, such as Assassin's Creed Jade and The Division Resurgence, are not included.) Click through the gallery below or continue scrolling for our rundown of all 16 announced games in development at Ubisoft.\n\nLast updated July 21, 2022, to reflect the recent Ubisoft cancellations.\n\nOddBallers\n\nOddBallers is a multiplayer party game that, according to Ubisoft, plays like \"dodgeball turned up to 11.\" Gameplay differs from arena to arena with different rules, environments, and mini-games. It supports four-player (six- on Switch) online and local matches.\n\nIt features a colorful, minimalist style and various customization options — from your character's appearance and celebration to the length and difficulty of matches.\n\nTom Clancy’s The Division Heartland\n\nTom Clancy’s The Division Heartland is one of three free-to-play shooters in development at Ubisoft. It’s in the works at Ubisoft’s Red Storm Entertainment, which contributed to development of the mainline Division games.\n\nHeartland is described as “a standalone game that doesn’t require previous experience with the series but will provide an all new perspective on the universe in a new setting.” Last we heard it was quietly delayed to Ubisoft’s fiscal year 2022-23. You can now sign up for a chance to participate in a future playtest.\n\nHeartland is one part of Ubisoft’s future plans for The Division. Another is a Netflix film starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Chastain.\n\nSkull & Bones\n\nSkull & Bones began life as a multiplayer expansion for Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag back in 2013 before becoming the standalone title it is today. However, it wasn’t until E3 2017 that Skull & Bones was properly revealed with a Fall 2018 release window — a window that has been pushed back once a year since. The game was delayed yet again in early 2023, moving from March 9 to \"early\" in Ubisoft's fiscal year 2023-24, which begins on April 1.\n\nIn 2022, following a reported reboot, Skull & Bones officially resurfaced. Out November 8, Skull & Bones is an open-sea adventure without a campaign. Instead, players will captain customizable pirate ships and embark on their own adventures, perhaps akin to Rare's Sea of Thieves. Skull & Bones can be played solo, though its shared world hosts 20 players on each server. Players can accept contracts, gather resources, and attack (and loot) the ships of merchants and other players.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nUbisoft also confirmed Skull & Bones will receive multiple years of free post-launch content, including regular updates, new content, activities, stories, and challenges.\n\nElisabeth Pellen, a longtime Ubisoft employee who wrote and directed 2003’s XIII, serves as the game's creative director. A female-led Skull & Bones TV show is also in the works.\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage\n\nUbisoft's next Assassin's Creed game takes the series back to its stealth-focused roots. Set 20 years before Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Mirage stars Basim Ibn Ishaq and is set in Baghdad, which will be split into four districts. The game is built on the three design pillars used to create the original Assassin's Creed: stealth, parkour, and assassinations.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nMirage removes the RPG elements from modern Assassin's Creed games in favor of a more linear, story-focused experience. It will feature a revamped detection system in an effort to enhance stealth encounters.\n\nMirage's smaller scale compared to that of recent games like Odyssey and Valhalla is reflected in its $50 USD price point.\n\nAvatar: Frontiers of Pandora\n\nAlso due out this year is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a first-person open-world game set in the universe of James Cameron’s Avatar film series. Ubisoft’s Massive Entertainment is developing the story-driven game in collaboration with Disney and Cameron’s Lightstorm Entertainment production company. Magnus Jansen, previously creative director on The Division, is leading creative direction on Avatar.\n\nDeveloped in Massive’s own Snowdrop engine, Frontiers of Pandora is a standalone story in which you play as a Na’vi fighting against the human-run RDA. It’s set in the Western Frontier, a “never-before-seen part of Pandora. Ubisoft gave us our first look at Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora during E3 2021. The trailer showed off Pandora’s vibrant world of alien flora and wildlife juxtaposed with an industrial RDA complex, culminating with a clash between the two.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nFrontiers of Pandora is skipping PS4 and Xbox One due to the technical limitations of last-gen consoles. By developing exclusively for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, Massive said it’s able to realize its vision of aerial gameplay, organic map design, and overall immersion.\n\nAnother benefit of dropping last-gen hardware is the impact on AI and NPCs. Lead narrative realization designer Alice Rendell said Massive has “created a system where our NPCs understand the state of the world – for example, weather, player progression, or time of day.\"\n\nThere’s currently no specific release date for Frontiers of Pandora, though it’s worth noting the next Avatar film hits theaters on December 16.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Infinity\n\nAssassin’s Creed Infinity isn't a game but an upcoming platform for future Assassin's games. \"It’s going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin’s Creed franchise into the future,\" said series executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté. \"Infinity is going to be a hub that will unite all our different experiences and our players together in meaningful ways.”\n\nThe first two games to launch into Assassin's Creed Infinity will be Codename Red and Hexe (more info below). In addition to Red and Hexe, Ubisoft is \"investigating how\" to bring back standalone multiplayer to Assassin's Creed. That potential project would also live in the Infinity Hub.\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Red\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Red is the series' next big-scale open-world RPG and its long-awaited venture into feudal Japan. Ubisoft has yet to reveal much about Red, including an official title or release window, though it did reveal a cinematic trailer during the latest Ubisoft Forward.\n\nCodename Red is in development at Ubisoft Quebec with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey creative director Jonathan Dumont at the helm. It will be the first game to launch into Assassin's Creed Infinity.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Hexe\n\nThe second game coming to Assassin's Creed Infinity is Codename Hexe. Even less is known about Hexe, though we do know it will be released sometime after Codename Red. It's in development at Ubisoft Montreal under the direction of Clint Hocking (Watch Dogs: Legion).\n\nHexe is described as “a very different type of Assassin’s Creed game.\" Given its creepy teaser trailer, which features ominous music and the series' signature triangular logo made of twigs and twine hanging from a tree branch, Hexe may be a horror-based take on Assassin's Creed.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nAssassin’s Creed VR\n\nAnother new game in the expansive world of Assassin's Creed is in development exclusively for Oculus VR.\n\nRed Storm Entertainment, the studio behind previous Ubisoft VR games Werewolf Within and Star Trek Bridge Crew, is leading development with support from Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Mumbai, and Reflections.\n\nUbisoft has yet to reveal much about its Assassin’s Creed VR game, only saying it’s being created “from the ground up specifically for the Oculus platform” and will incorporate “elements from the franchise that fans know and love.”\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2\n\nWhere to begin? How about fourteen years ago, in 2008, when Ubisoft first announced a follow-up to Beyond Good and Evil. Ubisoft would mention the project intermittently between then and 2017 when Beyond Good and Evil 2 was officially revealed.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 is an interplanetary action-adventure RPG. It’s intended to be a “massive, seamless online environment\" that can be experienced solo or cooperatively.\n\nStory-wise, Beyond Good and Evil 2 will be a prequel, though Ubisoft is billing it as a “spiritual successor” to the 2003 original. It’s set on the System 3 solar system, home to human and hybrid clones. Here’s a more detailed story synopsis from Ubisoft: “While corporations fight over resources and power, the clones weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth, a past and planet they never knew. In this new era of piracy, you will rise from a lowly pirate to a legendary one, adventuring alongside colorful characters to forge your own path across the stars.” Returning characters include original protagonist Jade, pig-hybrid Pey'j, and rhino-hybrid Mammagos.\n\nDevelopment was initially led by the original game’s creator, Michel Ancel, before he retired in 2020 to open a wildlife sanctuary. Ancel had been under investigation at Ubisoft shortly before his departure due to allegations of toxic behavior. Speaking with GamesIndustry, he claimed there was no link between the investigation and his departure. A new creative lead has not been publicly announced.\n\nShortly after news of Ancel’s departure broke, Ubisoft put out a statement saying the director hadn’t been “directly involved in BG&E2 for some time.” It also announced its intention to show gameplay in 2021, though that never materialized.\n\nA Bloomberg report published in February 2022 claimed Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in pre-production, five years after it was officially revealed. The last official development update came during a 2021 earnings call when Ubisoft was asked about a potential release year. CFO Frederick Duguet responded, ”We've progressed well with Beyond Good & Evil 2, but it's too early to tell you at this stage.\"\n\nIn our E3 2017 write-up, IGN’s Jon Ryan wrote,”I can’t recall how many times during my meeting with the development team of Beyond Good & Evil 2 I thought to myself, ‘This is impossible.’” Perhaps it was, JR. Perhaps it was.\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIn 2020 Ubisoft announced it was remaking Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, its excellent action-adventure game from 2003. It’s Ubisoft’s first-ever full-scale remake, and it’s being made by the publisher’s India-based studios in Pune and Mumbai.\n\nThe new Sands of Time tells the same story as the original, with Yuri Lowenthal returning to voice the prince. However, the remake will include new camera angles, “fully remade sequences,” and “a fresh approach to combat, puzzle-solving, and rewinding time.”\n\nAs for why Ubisoft is considering this a remake rather than a remaster, game director Pierre-Sylvain Gires told IGN, “It’s a remake because we rebuilt everything from scratch.” Motion capture, facial animation, and voice recording have all been re-recorded.\n\nThe remake was originally due out in January 2021. It was first delayed to March of that same year, before being delayed again without a new date. It’s now scheduled to launch during Ubisoft’s 2022-23 fiscal year that runs from April 2022 through March 2023.\n\nIn May 2022, Ubisoft announced it was moving development on Prince of Persia from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to its Montreal-based studio. Ubisoft Montreal will now \"take the time they need to regroup on the scope of the game to deliver you the best experience for this remake of an all-time classic, when it's ready.\" Then in June, the company delayed the remake beyond its 2023 fiscal year.\n\nProject U\n\nIn late September Ubisoft announced Project U, \"a new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat.\" The game is in early development, according to Ubisoft.\n\nProject U will have a closed, PC-only playtest in Western Europe. Those in the region can register on the game's official site.\n\nUbisoft has yet to reveal any further details about the shooter besides the concept art seen above. However, based on the art and short description, Project U may feature horde-style gameplay.\n\nThe Settlers\n\nThe eighth entry in the classic RTS series, The Settlers is a brand reboot for the 29-year-old franchise and the series' first new game since 2010. It features a story-driven campaign, multiplayer modes for up to 8 players, and three playable factions. Ubisoft Düsseldorf is leading development on the Snowdrop engine project.\n\nUbisoft previously announced work on a new Settlers game in 2014. However, that project would ultimately be separated from the franchise and released as Champions of Anteria in 2016. The Settlers was initially due out on March 17 before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Remake\n\nThe past decade has been rather unkind to Splinter Cell fans: Dead-end teases, seemingly false leaks, fake-out announcements, and undesired crossovers had left fans pessimistic about the series’ future. That changed in late 2021 when Ubisoft finally announced it had greenlit a new Splinter Cell, a remake of the 2002 original game in development at its Toronto-based studio. It’ll be the series’ first new entry since Toronto’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist in 2013.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Snowdrop engine remake is “in the very earliest stages of development,” according to Ubisoft. Chris Auty, former level design director on Far Cry 6, serves as the project’s creative director. He said it’s important to the team to preserve the essence of Splinter Cell and the sense of mastery it can beget by “supporting players who observe the situations, make their plan, use their gadgets, and outsmart the enemy creatively to deal with the challenges they are presented with.”\n\nProducer Matt West echoed that sentiment, confirming the remake will remain linear, rather than becoming open world: “Every square inch is part of a choice, or directly offers a choice, or has a direct ramification. That density of gameplay is at the forefront in Splinter Cell, and that’s going to be really, really important for us. The gameplay experience we are targeting is directly tied to what we want players to feel, to capture the essence back when we were all playing the original games.”\n\nAs for what will be different this time around (aside from vast visual improvements) West says “some of the design elements [will be updated] to match player comfort and expectations” that have evolved in the 20 years since the original was released.\n\nUbisoft’s Star Wars\n\nUbisoft and Lucasfilm Games are officially collaborating on a narrative-driven, open-world Star Wars game. The project’s announcement in early 2021 signaled the end of EA’s long-held Star Wars video game exclusivity.\n\nMassive Entertainment is leading development, with The Division 2 lead Julian Gerighty once again at the helm. Massive is also working on the aforementioned Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Both games are being built in the studio’s own Snowdrop engine.\n\nJob listings for the project call for experience with both action-adventure and RPG games, as well as linear and non-linear stories, giving us a hint at what we can expect from Ubisoft’s Star Wars. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has said it will be \"an original Star Wars adventure that is different from anything that has been done before.\"\n\nThe project came to be after Ubisoft and Disney met to discuss their Avatar game, SVP of Walt Disney Games Sean Shoptaw told IGN. \"There was such alignment and such creative passion around the Star Wars IP from [Massive] that it just was a natural evolution to the relationship, and really led to the Star Wars game we announced not too long ago,” he said.\n\nThere’s currently no release window for Massive’s Star Wars game, though sometime in the mid-2020s seems likely, as the studio is still finishing up work on Avatar and hiring heavily for Star Wars.\n\nXDefiant\n\nThe last of three free-to-play shooters in development at Ubisoft is XDefiant, a fast-paced, 6v6 arena shooter. It was previously known as Tom Clancy's XDefiant, though Ubisoft dropped \"Tom Clancy's\" from the title in 2022.\n\nUbisoft is currently playtesting the shooter and publishing updates on the game's official website.\n\nDevelopment is being led by Ubisoft San Francisco. Mark Rubin, who previously worked on Call of Duty for 10 years, is an executive producer on the project, while South Park: The Fractured But Whole director Jason Schroder serves as creative director.\n\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft’s upcoming lineup? Let us know in the comments!"
