        "text": "THE DOG ISLAND WII - RVL-RDIP-SCN\n\nThe Dog Island (often stylized as \"THE DOG Island\") is a 2008 role-playing video game for the Wii and PlayStation 2 consoles in which players control a dog and must go on a journey to search for a special flower to aid their sick sibling, which can only be found by achieving their goal to become a \"sniff master\". The player interacts with various other animals in the game that give hints and information to aid on the quest. It was released on April 26, 2007 in Japan by Yuke's.\n\nOn the Wii, the character is controlled by use of the Wii Remote moving an on-screen cursor around. On the PlayStation 2 version, it is through free movement via the controller.\n\nThe player can customize their dog with Fashion accessory/accessories in the game such as hats, glasses, ribbons, and more. As they get further in the game, more items become available at shops throughout the island, or can be created at the accessories shop. The player will need certain materials to create different accessories such as silver, colored glass and beautiful stone, which may be found in houses, outside, or as prizes in minigames.\n\nKOMPLETT I BOX\n\nKommentarer"
