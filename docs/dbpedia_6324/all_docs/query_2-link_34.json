        "text": "The list of upcoming Ubisoft games is finally looking more concrete. It's been a promising six months for the publisher, with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Skull and Bones now finally out in the wild, but there's plenty more in store for us in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThere are several upcoming Assassin's Creed games in the works, and one of them has an official title and release date at long last. Another upcoming Ubisoft game doubles up as one of the upcoming Star Wars games we're especially excited for, especially given that it will be the first ever open world game set in George Lucas's galaxy far, far away. Of course, Tom Clancy is returning for a third mainline romp, with Massive Entertainment back heading its development – oh, and we should be seeing that Division Resurgence mobile game launching later this year, alongside a certain other mobile-only offering that riffs off the publisher's flagship stealth series. Have a guess which.\n\nUbisoft has proven itself capable of producing excellence and variety across the board, whether in the best Assassin's Creed games or the fast-twitch gunplay as seen in open world action-adventures like Far Cry 5. That means there's sure to be something here for everyone on on this list of upcoming Ubisoft games, so get your eyes down for all the juicy details.\n\nUpcoming Ubisoft games 2024\n\nStar Wars Outlaws\n\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease date: August 30, 2024\n\nStar Wars Outlaws is a brand new adventure is coming from Massive Entertainment, the studio behind The Division and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It's being billed as the ever first open world Star Wars game, set to take us into the galactic underworld as Kay Vess – a scoundrel who is trying to pull off the biggest heist the Outer Rim has ever seen. Better yet, it's set between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi!\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nPlatforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nRelease date: November 15, 2024\n\nUbisoft Quebec is at the helm of Assassin's Creed Shadows, an action-RPG set to bring the long-running game series to Feudal Japan. The Assassin's Creed Syndicate studio is heralding the return of dual protagonists, with combat master samurai Yasuke and stealthy shinobi Naoe sharing the spotlight in a winding tale of political intrigue and mystery. AC has long charted the push-and-pull rivalry between the Assassin Brotherhood – aka, the Hidden Ones – and the various iterations of the Templars, and Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to carry on that tradition as the fourth open world RPG instalment.\n\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: TBC 2024\n\nTom Clancy's The Division Resurgence\n\nPlatforms: Apple, Android\n\nRelease date: Early 2024\n\nMobile-only The Division Resurgence has all the open world gunslinging of the original title, only this time it's all in the palm of your hand. It's going the free-to-play avenue, much like The Division Heartland, and although there's no global rollout confirmed it's already being released in Southeast Asia under a different publisher. Following The Division Resurgence playtest signups , we got an update during the Ubisoft Forward 2023, which confirmed we can expect to see Resurgence this fall.\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC (expected 2024)\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity is less of a game in itself and more like a hub. The intent is to make it a \"single entry point\" into the Assassin's Creed franchise for all fans, allowing for a level of overlap between the games to give the whole experience a meta twist. Current plans are to add new releases to the project as it develops, including Assassin's Creed Red and Hexe. Ubisoft is also exploring the possibility of Infinity becoming the home for future multiplayer Assassin's Creed games.\n\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: TBC 2025\n\nAnno 117: Pax Romana\n\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X, PS5\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nAiming to deliver a \"Roman gaming experience unlike anything else\", Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming in 2025. A brief teaser trailer shown at Ubisoft Forward 2024 is all we have to go on right now, introducing us to the next chapter in Ubisoft's long-running series following 2019's Anno 1800. We'll be going way back in time to the golden age of the Roman empire come 2025 for what's sure to be a return to the series' unique blend of detailed RTS and city-building gameplay. Concept art is all we have to go on for now, so we'll have to wait a little longer to see what exactly that might look like.\n\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: 2026\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC 2026\n\nThe Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is one of the most mysterious upcoming Ubisoft games on the list. This \"heavily under wraps\" remake of a classic entry in the action-adventure series is now being developed by Ubisoft Montreal, much like the original – and despite the sparse information at hand, an update from Ubisoft confirms that the project is \"very much alive\". We know that it's only just officially entered development following a restart in 2023, and with a ballpark release window of 2026, it'll be quite some time before we get to see the 2003 original remade for modern consoles.\n\nUpcoming Ubisoft games: TBC\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Jade\n\nPlatforms: iOS, Android\n\nRelease Date: TBC\n\nA beloved franchise is getting the mobile treatment in Assassin's Creed Codename Jade. It's set in ancient China, and save for the initial announcement trailer, details on this one are still rather hazy. We do know that Codename Jade will be a mobile-exclusive, open world game. With free reign of iconic landmark locations, Assassin's Creed executive director Marc-Alexis Côté says we will be able to \"parkour atop the Great Wall of China, sneak through bustling cities, engage in intense combat, and discover the secrets, the vastness, of ancient China.\"\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Hexe\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nSomething wicked this way comes? Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe is perhaps the most mysterious upcoming Ubisoft game of them all, purely for the fact that its short teaser trailer gives up next to nothing. All we can see from it is a handmade talisman, resembling the Assassin's insignia, dangling against the backdrop of a dark forest. Ubisoft has only gone so far as to describe Hexe as \"a very different Assassin's Creed game\", with speculating fans pointing to hints that Hexe might be set during the German witch trials. This seems entirely plausible, especially given the Pagan connotations of the talisman, so we can't help but get excited for a darker and somewhat spookier AC experience.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nFirst hinted at in 2008, Beyond Good and Evil 2 has become synonymous with developmental hell. It's been six years since Ubisoft officially announced it during E3 2017, and with just a few promo shots and press releases to on on since then, it's anyone's guess whether we can expect news anytime soon. What we do know is that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is intended as a prequel to the 2003 original, this time featuring more open world RPG gameplay, branching narratives, and the choice between playing solo or multiplayer modes.\n\nProject U\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nFor a game that's already had one closed beta test, there's precious little online about Project U. According to the Ubisoft website, Project U is a \"new concept of session-based co-op shooter, where many players unite to prevail against an overwhelming threat.\" This isn't the first time the publisher has hazarded a go at a co-op looter-shooter, though, with the cancellation of Project Q earlier this year sending its crew to work on Assassin's Creed Mirage instead.\n\nSplinter Cell remake\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nOne upcoming Ubisoft game we would love to get a closer look at is the Splinter Cell remake, which went into development in 2021. With Ubisoft Toronto at the helm, the studio is keen to \"make sure the spirit of the early games remains intact\" – that means we'll hopefully see the stealth-heavy action gameplay we remember from the 2002 original. It's apparently possible to get through the whole game without a single kill, too, but we'll believe it when we see some gameplay.\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 3\n\nPlatforms: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nThis one is probably in its most embryonic stages of pre-production planning, but Ubisoft has casually let slip that Tom Clancy's The Division 3 is in the works. We don't know much else about it just yet, save that it'll be developed by Massive Entertainment and spearheaded by Julian Gerighty as executive producer of the whole Tom Clancy brand (via Twitter). Since he is currently directing Star Wars Outlaws, though, we don't expect to see the third Division game (or hear much more about it) until Outlaws launches at an as-yet unknown date in 2024."
