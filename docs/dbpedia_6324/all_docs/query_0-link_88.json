        "text": "There are so many exciting upcoming PS5 games to look forward to. With so many strong releases in 2024, it's already been a great year for the system, but more is yet to come!\n\nWith anticipated PS5 exclusives such as the Silent Hill 2 remake on the near horizon and a variety of third-party titles to look out for, there's no shortage of new games for 2024 to keep an eye out for. Plus, if you're looking to make use of your PSVR2 headset, there are also some upcoming PSVR 2 games to look forward to. So, if you're looking to add to your wishlist or get a refresher of everything that's on the way, read on below to find a roundup of all of the upcoming PS5 games, all in release date order.\n\nStill looking for Sony's new console? Here's the latest on PS5 restock updates\n\nUpcoming PS5 games to watch out for\n\n2024\n\nConcord\n\nDeveloper: Concord\n\nPublisher: PlayStation Studios\n\nRelease date: August 23, 2024\n\nConcord is one of the biggest PS5 exclusives on the books for 2024. It's the debut game from Firewalk studios, a studio which PlayStation acquired in 2023 and is headed up by former Activision CFO Tony Hsu and former Bungie creative director Ryan Ellis. Concord is a fast-paced 5v5 competitive shooter which looks like Overwatch meets Guardians of the Galaxy. It looks rad, and you'll be able to try it for yourself this summer when a beta goes live in July.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws\n\nDeveloper: Massive Entertainment\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft, Lucasfilm Games\n\nRelease date: August 30, 2024\n\nStar Wars Outlaws is the new open-world Star Wars project from Ubisoft, Massive Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games, and it'll see us taking up the role of Kay Vess. Described as a clever scoundrel, Kay can be found lurking in the underworld about to attempt one of the Outer Rim's biggest heists yet. You'll be accompanied by her companion Nix and a trench-coat-wearing BX-commando droid for the journey too.\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch Champions\n\nDeveloper: Unbroken Studios\n\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Games\n\nRelease date: September 3, 2024\n\nDidn't quite get enough of the Wizarding World from Hogwarts Legacy? You'll be able to take your frustrations out on the Quidditch pitch starting September 3. Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions hands you a broomstick and sees you zipping, dodging, and - probably - falling through airborne matches either solo or in co-op. Whether you're taking up the position of beater, chaser, keeper, or seeker, Quidditch Champions will put you in the middle of your favorite fantasy sport across a range of different arenas. The game will land on PS5 this year, with PS Plus members seemingly playing for free up to September 30.\n\nThe Casting of Frank Stone\n\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\n\nPublisher: Behavior Interactive\n\nRelease date: September 3, 2024\n\nThe Casting of Frank Stone is one of the most talked about upcoming horror games and comes from Until Dawn and The Quarry developer, Supermassive Games. Made in partnership with Behaviour Interactive, the story takes place in the universe of Dead by Daylight in the town of Cedar Hills, which is said to have been forever altered thanks to a killer by the name of Frank Stone. With a bloody history, you'll find yourself exploring the mystery of Cedar Hills with a new cast of characters, and every decision you make will shape your journey.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n\nDeveloper: Saber Interactive\n\nPublisher: Focus Entertainment\n\nRelease date: September 9, 2024\n\nIt's time to become a Space Marine in this return of the cult-classic series, in development at Saber Interactive (best known for World War Z). It's a third-person adventure that'll see you wield deadly abilities and weaponry to take down the Tyranid hordes as you work to protect humanity. It looks intense, as you'd hope.\n\nThrone and Liberty\n\nDeveloper: NCSoft\n\nPublisher: NCSoft\n\nRelease date: September 17, 2024\n\nAmazon Games and NCSoft are joining forces to bring us Throne and Liberty. It was originally intended as a continuation of the Lineage series, also from NCSoft, but Throne and Liberty is a brand-new experience. The Korean MMORPG will feature both PvE and PvP modes as you explore a unique fantasy world, using magic to battle all manner of foes on your quest to reclaim the throne. Announced during Summer Game Fest 2023, the game is set to release this year on September 17.\n\nEnotria: The Last Song\n\nDeveloper: Jyamma Games\n\nPublisher: Jyamma Games\n\nRelease date: September 18, 2024\n\nEnotria: The Last Song takes us on a soulslike journey through a historical Italian world, where deadly battles take place against gorgeous sunset backdrops. Between giant enemies, strange masks, and the mysterious power of Ardore there's still plenty to discover about this fantastical world and, by the looks of it, a sophisticated system of playstyle customization as well. We were first treated to the official trailer during Summer Games Fest, with the full title available from September 18.\n\nSilent Hill 2 Remake\n\nDeveloper: Bloober Team\n\nPublisher: Konami\n\nRelease date: October 8, 2024\n\nThat’s right, one of the best Silent Hill games is getting a fancy remake and is heading our way in October. Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he undergoes psychological torment and faces literal nightmares during his journey to uncover the truth behind a message left to him by his deceased wife. This is a PS5 exclusive and gives the iconic horror game a new breath of life. It’s a new title you definitely don’t want to miss.\n\nDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero\n\nDeveloper: Spike Chunsoft Co\n\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\n\nRelease date: October 11, 2024\n\nDragon Ball: Sparking Zero will hit PS5 consoles in October this year, updating the Budokai Tenkaichi series with a new installment featuring some particularly legendary characters. Each fighter comes with their own signature moves and styles, for a full sandbox of classic anime action.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio\n\nDeveloper: Studio Zero\n\nPublisher: Atlus\n\nRelease date: October 11, 2024\n\nEnjoy the Persona games but wish they were both weirder and set in a medieval fantasy world? I've got some great news for you then, because that's basically the description for Metaphor: ReFantazio. Production is being led by Katsura Hashino (director of Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5), and it looks utterly wild. Turn-based combat, nightmare-fuel enemies, and overworld exploration which factors in both a calendar system and light social simulation elements. Mark this one on your calendar.\n\nNew World: Aeternum\n\nDeveloper: In-house\n\nPublisher: Amazon Games\n\nRelease date: October 15, 2024\n\nNew World: Aeternum marks the MMO-meets-action-RPG's console launch, encompassing the base game as well as a massive update in the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion. October 15 is the day PS5 players will be able to step ashore the island of Aeternum for themselves, and with New World's new single-player mode, you won't have to hop online and muck in with your fellow players unless you're craving the MMO experience or some PvP action. Promising deep character builds and razor-sharp combat as you explore its punishing environs, this is one upcoming PS5 game to watch for in the coming weeks.\n\nUnknown 9: Awakening\n\nDeveloper: Reflector Entertainment\n\nPublisher: Bandai Namco Entertainment\n\nRelease date: October 18, 2024\n\nCurrently slated for October, Unknown 9: Awakening takes us into the soul-shifting world of Haroona, a dimension hopper that can move between our plane and another mysterious realm. This action RPG takes players on Haroona's journey to seek ancient knowledge and harness her own unique powers, all while being hunted by a nefarious sect known as the Ascendants who - you guessed it - want to use all that power for bad.\n\nSonic x Shadow Generations\n\nDeveloper: Sonic Team\n\nPublisher: SEGA\n\nRelease date: October 25, 2024\n\nGet ready for the most badass hedgehogs in gaming to make a show-stopping return in Shadow x Sonic Generations, an upcoming PS5 game landing on October 25. The reveal trailer shown at this year's Summer Game Show gives us a taste of its madcap platforming, pinball, and racing action that looks set to keep us occupied as the weather starts getting chillier and nights on the sofa look more and more appealing. SEGA describes it as \"an all-new collection featuring two unique experiences\", including one that takes us through Shadow's own backstory to reveal what makes him such a tried-and-true badass.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nDeveloper(s): Treyarch and Raven Software\n\nPublisher: Activision\n\nRelease date: October 25, 2024\n\nIf you are like us here at GamesRadar+ and love replaying the best FPS games in your downtime, then you’re probably excited about the upcoming PS5 title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. That’s right, after beating the record for the longest Call of Duty game in development, we are finally getting Black Ops 6 this year, presented in a neat spy-thriller package set in the ‘90s. There’re 16 new maps, and two new integrations of the iconic Zombies mode to look forward to here. So yeah, it sounds like we have one of the best Call of Duty games on our hands and that our patience will be worth it!\n\nLife is Strange Double Exposure\n\nDeveloper: Deck Nine\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nRelease date: October 29, 2024\n\nLife is Strange Double Exposure is the fourth main entry in the iconic Life Is Strange series. However, let’s make things clear: this is a direct sequel to the 2015 game Life Is Strange. Players will get to control Max Caulfield and get down to all that time winding gameplay that we love as a new murder mystery unfolds. The game is set to drop in October, so we only have a few more months of waiting!\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nRelease date: October 31, 2024\n\nWe finally have some news on Dragon Age 4 - or Dragon Age: The Veilguard as it's officially called! Although there was a time of platform concerns, the fantasy title is an upcoming PS5 game. We also know that it is releasing on October 31, meaning that Solas and Co. are making a return in the Fall. Besides a fancy trailer and teasers, there is some glorious concept art and the confirmation that it will continue on from where Dragon Age: Inquisition left off for us to look forward to.\n\nSlitterhead\n\nDeveloper: Bokeh Game Studio\n\nPublisher: Bokeh Game Studio\n\nRelease date: November 8, 2024\n\nThe first new game from Silent Hill's Keiichiro Toyama promises to get under your skin. If you're a fan of Japanese body horror mixed with crisp PS5 visuals, this is going to be a must-see, especially seeing as the newly announced release date will throw us straight back into Spooksville shortly after Halloween. This isn't quite the psychological survival horror that its studio started out with, rather Slitterhead's neon city lights, katanas, and - yes - tentacles look set to make for a more action-packed experience overall.\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Quebec\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nRelease date: November 15, 2024\n\nFormerly known as Assassin's Creed Red, Ubisoft has since confirmed that this upcoming Assassin's Creed game will be titled Shadows. Set in 16th-century Feudal Japan, Assassin's Creed Shadows will have you facing off against the Templar Order from the perspective of two playable characters – Naoe, a shinobi, and Yasuke, an African samurai with his roots in historical fact. Shadows is a return to the sprawling open-world RPG format, and it's going to be one of the biggest games of 2024.\n\nMarvel Rivals\n\nDeveloper: NetEase Games\n\nPublisher: NetEase Games\n\nRelease date: December 6, 2024\n\nIf you love the MCU as well as a good shooter, then the upcoming PS5 game, Marvel Rivals, is for you. Launching on December 6 across several platforms, PS5 players will be able to play a variety of heroes and supervillains from Marvel’s impressive character roster and play 6v6 matches across various colorful maps. This is one of our most anticipated upcoming Marvel games to keep an eye on right now, and from what we’ve seen from trailers and teasers already, it looks like it's going to be a hit.\n\nTBC 2024\n\nEverywhere\n\nDeveloper: In-house\n\nPublisher: Build a Rocket Boy\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nEverywhere is the new upcoming \"multi-world\" game first revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Developed by Build a Rocket Boy with former Rockstar president Leslie Benzie on the project, we got a very early look at the project, which, according to the official site, \"seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience\", that's claims to redefine \"how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.\" Since the initial reveal was shrouded in mystery, no platforms were announced, but we assume it's set to come to PS5.\n\nJohn Carpenter's Toxic Commando\n\nDeveloper: In-house\n\nPublisher: Saber Interactive\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nIf gunning down zombies in a game co-created by a horror icon sounds like your idea of a party, boy does John Carpenter's Toxic Commando have a surprise for you. We first caught wind of it at Summer Game Fest 2023, and the announcement trailer is suitably chaotic. From the spray of bullets raining down on legions of the undead to decidedly out-of-tune rendition of You Give Love a Bad Name underscoring it all, this is one horde FPS game worth keeping an eye on as we await a more concrete release date.\n\nLego Horizon Adventures\n\nDeveloper: Studio Gobo / Guerilla\n\nPublisher: Sony\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nAloy is heading to the Lego universe in an upcoming PS5 game bridging the gap between a post-post apocalyptic world and the beloved brick-based toy franchise. Lego Horizon Adventures will hit the shelves later this year, bringing our fiery-haired heroine into mini-fig form, alongside all your favorite machines (and a hot dog guy for good measure). Just how well the grittier world of Horizon translates into the whimsical planes of Lego remains to be seen, but so far this looks like a fun time.\n\nLittle Devil Inside\n\nDeveloper: Neostream Interactive\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nLittle Devil Inside first began life on Kickstarter back in 2015. Fast forward five years later and we see a debut trailer during the PS5 reveal stream with the news that it will be a timed exclusive. As an RPG with survival elements, Little Devil inside is set in the \"Victorian-like\" era in a semi-open world. The trailer showed off a whole host of monsters and also gave us brief glimpses of some of the combat elements and features. It was easily one of the biggest surprises of the recent showcase.\n\nLight No Fire\n\nDeveloper: Hello Games\n\nPublisher: Hello Games\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nNo Man's Sky developer Hello Games is bringing us a new experience with Light No Fire - a survival sandbox adventure you can play with others. Set on an open-world fantasy planet that's described as being the same size as the Earth, you'll be given the freedom to explore its diverse biomes as you try to unravel its lore and mysteries. With building and survival aspects, we also saw in the reveal trailer that you can fly through the vistas on the back of a dragon, climb mountains, and even set sail across the oceans.\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked\n\nDeveloper: Moon Studios\n\nPublisher: Private Division\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked from Ori and the Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps developer Moon Studios is a new action RPG set in the year 841.

The diablo-esque experience features different character builds to play around with, along with an online co-op mode that will allow you to play with up to three friends.\n\nNeva\n\nDeveloper: Nomada Studio\n\nPublisher: Devolver Digital\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nLittle is known about Neva at the moment, save for what we saw at the PlayStation Showcase 2023, but its stunning 2D landscapes speak to a fantastical world where man and wolf live in harmony. Another look at Summer Games Fest took us back into these almost water-color worlds to tell the story of a young woman venturing forth with a strange wolf cub in tow. The pair will platform their way through a slowly decaying world set against a plethora of gorgeous backdrops and moody sunsets.\n\nTowers of Aghasba\n\nDeveloper: Dreamlit Games\n\nPublisher: TBC\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nIf paragliding around Hyrule is your favorite part of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Towers of Aghasba is one to watch out for. We first caught wind of the fantasy adventure title almost five years ago, so it's a relief to hear that it's finally slated to launch in 2024. The game sees the player traversing a strange alien planet from the skies, battling bizarre monsters and creatures while coasting above what looks to be an expansive open world.\n\nWanderstop\n\nDeveloper: Ivy Road\n\nPublisher: Annapurna Interactive\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nRun a tea shop and farm for ingredients in this cozy upcoming PS5 game. Annapurna has a flair for delivering the quirkiest games out there, with last years' Thirsty Suitors being a prime example, and Wanderstop is carrying on that proud tradition. It's described by the developer as a narrative-rich cozy gaming experience about the simple things in life: change (the personal growth kind, we assume), and the healing powers of tea. This looks like a beautiful story-driven life and crafting sim already, so get it on your list of games to watch in 2024.\n\n2025\n\nCivilization 7\n\nDeveloper: Firaxis Games\n\nPublisher: 2K Games\n\nRelease date: February 11, 2025\n\nIt’s been eight years, but we’re finally getting the next installment in the Civilization series. And the good news is that there are plenty of details to dig into about the upcoming PS5 game. We know that Civilization 7 will launch consecutively on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on February 11, 2025. During Gamescom Opening Night Live, we also got a new trailer showing us tons of exciting new features. Honestly, it looks like we have one of the new best strategy games on our hands, folks!\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\nDeveloper: Warhorse Studios\n\nPublisher: Deep Silver\n\nRelease date: February 11, 2025\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a long time in the works, but Summer Games Fest gave us a new look at the stories, characters, and combat we can look forward to in the next installment. The 15th-century action RPG showed off its more comic backbone in the latest trailers, but between that quick sex-scene cutaway and the odd slightly clumsy quip, we were treated to a satisfying selection of first-person combat clips. Whether you pick up your bow and arrow or hop on your trusty steed, this looks like a raucously good time.\n\nLost Records: Bloom and Rage\n\nDeveloper: Don't Nod\n\nPublisher: Don't Nod\n\nRelease date: February 18, 2025\n\nLost Records: Bloom and Rage is a new story-driven adventure from Life is Strange developer, Don't Nod.

That’s right, we are getting another sci-fi looter shooter, and we couldn’t be happier. The upcoming game will see us exploring new alien worlds, as we say goodbye to Pandora for now. With new lands to uncover, treasure to claim, and enemies to shoot in the head, Borderlands 4 promises to be one of the most exciting new PS5 games heading our way in 2025.\n\nCrimson Desert\n\nDeveloper: Pearl Abyss\n\nPublisher: Pearl Abyss\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nFrom the developers of Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open world game that is packed with medieval action. Set on the war-torn continent of Pywel, players will take on the mercenary Macduff as they explore various settlements, take down massive bosses, and encounter mythical beasts on their journey. All the trailers and teasers that we’ve seen for Crimson Desert look fantastic, and we can’t wait to get our hands on it.\n\nDeath Stranding 2\n\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\n\nPublisher: Sony Entertainment\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nKojima Productions is back with Death Stranding 2, and although Kojima is claiming that it's just a working title for now, it is a sequel to the 2019 title. The teaser trailer shown at the Game Awards 2022 featured Fragile protecting what we assume to be a toddler version of BB, a greying Sam Porter Bridges, and a ship that looked very much like the Metal Gear Rex. Concrete details right now are scarce, but we do know that the cast currently includes Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna, and Troy Baker.\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages\n\nDeveloper: id Software\n\nPublisher: Bethesda Softworks\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages, the prequel to the Doom reboot and Doom Eternal, is coming to PC and consoles in 2025. That means we have the new entry to the franchise behind some of the best shooters heading to PS5 on the day it launches, a very welcomed surprise given how Microsoft own the Doom Slayer’s next outing. Doom: The Dark Ages will take PS5 and Xbox players alike to a medieval setting complete with demon dragons and burning castles. Its unique setting makes it the ideal game for fantasy fans who also love to punish the forces of hell. Trust us; we’ll be playing this one as soon as we can.\n\nGTA 6\n\nDeveloper: In-hoise\n\nPublisher: Rockstar Games\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nRockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 is coming to PS5 in 2025. The new Grand Theft Auto game is going to take us back to Vice City, albeit now in the present day. While the studio is yet to show off any gameplay, we do know that it'll be a crime thriller starring a new protagonist named Lucia – a criminal who is trying rehabilitate after a prison state, and survive the chaos of the sunshine state.

Xbox and PC players can start Indy’s new adventure on December 9, 2024. While no one likes to wait, we at least know that the game is heading to PS5 and that we’ll still get the chance to face Nazis, travel the world, and solve various puzzles during our treasure-hunting exploits. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, so it will truly be our chance to live out our action movie fantasies once 2025 rolls around.\n\nJudas\n\nDeveloper: Ghost Story Games\n\nPublisher: Ghost Story Games\n\nRelease date: March 2025\n\nBioShock creator Ken Levine has finally revealed his new project - Judas. With seriously strong BioShock vibes, Judas is a single-player narrative title where you must try to escape a disintegrating starship. You must survive by either making or breaking alliances with the other people on the ship, your so-called worst enemies. You're playing as the titular Judas, who is described as \"mysterious and troubled\", and seemingly has powers in her left hand that she can switch out - again very Bioshock in space vibes all round.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds is said to be the next generation of the Monster Hunter series that will take full advantage of the power of the PS5. With a reveal at The Game Awards 2023, we got a glimpse of the new experience, which features a \"new level of detailed creatures and ecosystems\" within what looks set to be one expansive open-world setting. There's still much we don't yet know about the adventure, but it's certainly giving similar vibes to Monster Hunter World.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2\n\nDeveloper: The Chinese Room\n\nPublisher: Paradox Interactive\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nLooking for a game with a bit of extra bite?Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 puts you in the seedy underbelly of Seattle, which should suit you just fine as a vampire ready to test out your new fangs. Turned as an act of vampire terrorism during the 'Mass Embrace', you'll soon get caught up in vampire faction politics, where you're still just trying to deal with your new way of life. This is an RPG at its core, too, filled with player choices, a strong narrative, and branching dialogue options.\n\nTBC\n\nAssassin's Creed Hexe\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nUbisoft Montreal – the birthplace of Assassin's Creed – is working on a very different type of entry to the series. Following the release of Assassin's Creed Valhalla in 2020, the studio has been quietly working on Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe under the leadership of Watch Dogs Legion's creative director Clint Hocking. While it's thought to be in early development, an early tease suggests a far darker setting that could revolve around Europe's bloody 16th century witch trials. Sadly, there's a good chance we'll be waiting until 2024 and beyond for this one.\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity\n\nDevelopers: Ubisoft Montreal, Ubisoft Quebec\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity remains one of the most mysterious projects in development at Ubisoft. This cross-studio collaboration sees Ubisoft Montreal (Assassin's Creed Valhalla) and Ubisoft Quebec (Assassin's Creed Odyssey) working more closely to shape and define the future of this long-running series. While details are light on the ground, it's expected that Assassin's Creed Infinity will act as an interactive hub, connecting players and future AC experiences into one seamless, evolving platform. Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first game available via Infinity, so we are anticipating that it will land on November 15 as well. But, we're still waiting for firm confirmation.\n\nCities Skylines 2\n\nDeveloper: Colossal Order\n\nPublisher: Paradox\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nCities Skylines 2 is finally coming to console after its PC launch last year, and is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular city builders of all time.

Dune: Awakening is said to blend the survival game genre with a multiplayer experience as you try to live in the harsh landscapes of the planet. You'll be building shelters to weather sandstorms, looking after your stillsuit, and trying to brave the deep desertland. It'll be interesting to see how the famous setting serves as a home for an MMO experience. During Gamescom 2024, it was announced that the game is set to release in Early Access for PC players in 2025. However, we are still waiting on a PS5 release window.\n\nElder Scrolls 6\n\nDeveloper: Bethesda Game Studios\n\nPublisher: Bethesda\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nAh, the Elder Scrolls 6. The 37-second trailer that blew the world's mind at E3 2018. The game that we know nothing about beyond this same trailer, that is in development somewhere within Bethesda Game Studios along with Starfield. Because it is so far away from release, you can bet your bottom coin that it's going to appear - at some point - on the PS5 (although hopefully not whatever the PS6 could be).\n\nFairgames\n\nDeveloper: Haven Studios\n\nPublisher: SIE\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nHaven Studios was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2022, becoming part of the PlayStation Studios family to help lead the PS5's expanding live service initiative. The studio's debut is Fairgames, an all-new co-op experience where you'll team up with friends to go up against the corporate overloads squeezing the life out of the world. This PS5 exclusive is still in early development, but we'll be keeping a close eye on this one in the months ahead.\n\nMarathon\n\nDeveloper: Bungie\n\nPublisher: SIE\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nA classic shooter is getting more than a fresh lick of paint in Bungie’s high-octane remake of Marathon. The announcement trailer seen during the PlayStation Showcase 2023 is peppered with nods to the arcade stylings of the 1994 original, this time in sleek, hyper-pigmented 4K graphics to introduce Marathon to a new generation. It’s good to see Bungie giving some love to other IPs aside from Destiny 2 and Halo, even without a confirmed release date, and it’s safe to say the trailer has whet our appetites for what lies ahead.\n\nMarvel's Wolverine\n\nDeveloper: Insomniac\n\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nUndoubtedly one of the biggest surprises of the PlayStation September 2021 showcase came in the shape of those famous adamantium claws belonging to none other than Wolverine. Yes, a new standalone Marvel's Wolverine game is currently in development. While we're light on details for the moment, we do know Brian Horton is Wolverine's creative director, and Cameron Christian is the game director. Horton was creative director on Spider-Man Miles Morales and has also worked on games such as Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nChristian previously worked on Spider-Man and Spider-Man Miles Morales, as well as other titles such as Sunset Overdrive.

Thankfully, Konami is working to introduce one of the best PS2 games to a whole new generation of players with a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake for PS5. While we're yet to get any concrete details on the expected changes or a look at any real-time gameplay, we are keen to see what steps Konami will take to modernize this exceptionally important (and incredibly strange) stealth-action game.\n\nNew Mass Effect\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nIt might be quite a way off release, but that isn't going to stop us being ridiculously overexcited for a brand new Mass Effect game - aka Mass Effect 5. Seemingly picking up after the events of Mass Effect 3, we'll be seeing some old faces return and some plot lines picked back up. Of course, the big question of whether Shepard will return remains, but we're ready for everything.\n\nPhantom Blade 0\n\nDeveloper: Cruel Man Studio\n\nPublisher: S-Game\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nIf you're a fan of samurai swashbuckling and moody feudal Japan as a setting, Phantom Blade 0 seems to be promising us both. The third person action title is yet to have a confirmed release date, but from what we've seen at the PlayStation Showcase 2023, your character has \"66 days to live\". What will he do with it? \"Get my heart back,\" he responds. We don't know much else just yet, but its brooding color scheme and fast-paced melee combat seem like a dynamic blend of Gungrave GORE aesthetics with Ghost of Tsushima action, and we're already here for it.\n\nPragmata\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nCapcom revealed a mysterious new game called Pragmata that leaves more questions than it answers but certainly piqued a lot of interest when it was added to the upcoming PS5 games list.

While it won't be coming any time soon, we're certainly eager to learn more about this rather enigmatic adventure.\n\nProject 007\n\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\n\nPublisher: IO Interactive\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nIO Interactive is gearing up to tell the origin story for James Bond in a brand new game currently titled Project 007. Although details are scarce, and an official name is yet to be revealed, what we do know is that it's going to be an entirely original James Bond story - so not tied to the novels or films. Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO says that it is \"the most ambitious game in the history of our studio\". Exciting times ahead.\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake\n\nDeveloper: Aspyr\n\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment and Lucasfilms Games\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nAfter many rumors began to circulate, the latest Sony showcase confirmed that a remaster of BioWare's beloved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is on the way and it's coming to PS5.

Developed alongside former Thatgamecompany artist, who helped shape the iconic look of indies like Flow, Flower, and Journey, this beautiful indie looks set to put a focus on exploration and free-flowing navigation, with your armament used not only for defense but hyperkinetic sand-surfing too.
