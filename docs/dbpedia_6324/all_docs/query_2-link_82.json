        "text": "It is a fact that Ubisoft has expanded the studios dedicated to Assassin’s Creed. Its star saga will continue to receive titles in the coming years, so much so that the French company has already drawn up a roadmap full of titles. Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming has confirmed that 11 games in the series are in development, including a remake of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag.\n\nAfter the rumor surfaced, Henderson has consulted his sources, who have confirmed plans to make a revamped version of the fourth installment, although the project has just been approved. Three of the additional titles were revealed by Insider Gaming in early 2023 (Project Nebula, Project Raid, and Project Echoes). These are the games in development:\n\nThe 11 new Assassin’s Creeds for 2023 and beyond\n\nUbisoft Sofia (Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation, Assassin’s Creed Rogue) is working on Project Nebula, a game that will have three different settings: India, the Aztec Empire, and the Mediterranean. Ubisoft Chengdu (Immortals Fenyx Rising: Myths of the Eastern Kingdom) is working on a free-to-play cooperative PvE for up to 4 players. Meanwhile, Ubisoft Annecy’s Assassin’s Creed multiplayer game, Project Echoes, will use Ubisoft Scalar technology."
