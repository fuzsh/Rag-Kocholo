        "text": "So I have been playing through this game, and most of the time, I have been in a state of, well, not quite awe, more like amazement. This game is better, way better, than it has any right to be. I picked this up in the states for $5, on a lark, and just got around to playing it the other day.\n\nConsidering that the Wii is known for crappy mini game collections, that it is the system that the developers usually (not always, see Mario Galaxy) half ass it on, this game is incredible. There, I said it. Keep in mind, this is a game based around the Artist series of super cute doggy pictures- this game should've been the biggest piece of junk ever (take note: Build a Bear Workshop, as an example of what I was expecting here). I got it because I thought it would be laughably bad, and I could show people how lame it was- I was completely wrong.\n\nWhomever made this should be in charge of licensed games for the rest of time- I honestly can't remember playing a better game with a worse license. This kills pretty much any movie or TV based game I have ever played.\n\nThe gameplay is basically the digging parts of Zelda and Okami- very simple, but this is a kids game. The graphics are super cute, but nice. Looks like Animal Crossing with cuter animals. The music is awesome- catchy acoustic guitar riffs, with some nice drums and bass added in. Not too many songs, but very nice. I would say that the gameplay can be thought of as repetitive, but I like collecting stuff, and the sniffing mechanic is pretty well done.\n\nThe fact that a company took this license, and made a gme like this . . . it boggles the mind. I have been playing for about four hours, and I figured I was pretty far into it- then, after completing a quest (all the quests involve sniffing around and digging up stuff), I was given the option to zoom out the map. I did, and that's when it hit me- holy crap, they put a lot of work into this game! The game world is huge. HUGE!!! I think I've seen maybe 1/6 of it- not Zelda sized or anything, but way bigger than I thought.\n\nAnd speaking of expectations, the storyline is pretty basic (save your sick brother/sister), but the cut scenes are interesting. And in one of them, they actually show someone dying- seriously. So, a kids game, but not a pandering one at all.\n\nWould I call it the greatest game ever? No. Not even close. But this is the most surprising, and strangest, game that I have played in years. It has no right to be this good.\n\nSorry, rambling on christmas\n\nby the way, Merry Christmas!"
