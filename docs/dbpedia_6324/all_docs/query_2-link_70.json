        "text": "Ubisoft narrowed the release date window for two major titles, announcing in its third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings Thursday that “Star Wars Outlaws” will release before the end of the year and that “Assassin’s Creed Codename Red” will launch by March 2025.\n\n“Moving forward, we’re gearing up for a very promising lineup for fiscal year 2025, including the upcoming release of ‘Star Wars Outlaws’ in 2024, which should be a major milestone in the video game industry, especially given the undeniable appeal of this legendary franchise that will be coming for the first time to the Open World territory, as well as ‘Assassin’s Creed Codename Red,’ set in the long-awaited feudal Japan universe,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a quarterly earnings letter to shareholders Thursday. “We look forward to revealing the full extent of the creative capabilities of Ubisoft’s teams, who are working hard to make these games a success that will live up to gamers’ expectations.”\n\nFrance-based Ubisoft’s fiscal year runs April-March, meaning that the latest “Assassin’s Creed Codename Red” would debut and remain in fiscal ’25, which ends March 31, 2025.\n\nPer Ubisoft, the company will unveil its fiscal year 2024-25 slate in more detail in May, including “Assassin’s Creed Codename Red” and “Star Wars Outlaws,” as well as free-to-play titles “The Division Resurgence” and “Rainbow Six Mobile.”\n\nIn its fiscal Q3 results Thursday, Ubisoft reported better net bookings than it originally forecast for the quarter, coming in at 626 million euros ($674 million) from October-December 2023 compared with its guidance of 610 million euros. Ubisoft says the results were driven by the release of “Assassin’s Creed Mirage,” as well as an uptick in back catalog sales."
