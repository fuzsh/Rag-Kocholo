        "text": "The momentum of GameFi is continuing to snowball into the latter half of 2024, with AAA game devs Ubisoft entering the market. The blockchain gaming industry exploded earlier this year, thanks to the messaging app Telegram cementing itself as the home of GameFi.\n\nEarning minigames utilising native cryptocurrencies – such as Hamster Kombat and Notcoin – have secured hundreds of millions of players within months. And with big names from console and PC gaming joining the sector, GameFi’s stellar trend is showing no signs of slowing.\n\nRelated: Sky Mavis Co-founder Jeff Zirlin Spotlights Gaming Expansion in Ronin Ecosystem\n\nCaptain Laserhawk Based on Netflix Show\n\nThe French gaming developers and publishers revealed their latest venture in the Web3 universe – Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E.\n\nThe title will be built atop Arbitrum, one of the most popular L2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, and will include fan favourite characters from other Ubisoft franchises like Rayman and Assassin’s Creed.\n\nThe game will be based upon Netflix’s new release, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, which in turn is a homage to a decade-old Far Cry 3 expansion.\n\nThere are very few details around gameplay, and the community will be hoping Ubisoft is bursting down the doors of GameFi, rather than meekly entering with a half-hearted money grab.\n\nUbisoft One of the Biggest Names to Take Part in GameFi\n\nUbisoft is well known among gamers thanks to its landmark franchise Assassin’s Creed and other hits like Far Cry, Just Dance, Prince of Persia and Tom Clancy. So when the publisher announces a game, you know it probably won’t be a low-effort play-to-earn title like many other blockchain-based games.\n\nAlthough GameFi is still in its infancy, there are still many deep, enjoyable titles available that leverage the power of the blockchain to unlock new gaming possibilities. However, games in the industry generally lack the scope, graphics and performance that you find with modern titles on PC or consoles.\n\nRelated: DOOM to Dogecoin! Now You Can Play Legendary Shooter On-Chain\n\nThat’s why Ubisoft’s announcement is both exciting and concerning for GameFi fans. The new title has the potential to demonstrate to other big-name gaming devs that Web3 gaming is a legitimate market worth their time – but it could also end in disappointment.\n\nOnly time will tell."
