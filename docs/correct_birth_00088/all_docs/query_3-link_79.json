        "text": "Mammootty's son Dulquer Salmaan is also a successful actor and he shared a wonderful note on social media for his father on his birthday.\n\nMalayalam superstar Mammootty, born on September 7, 1951, celebrated his 65th birthday on Wednesday. The actor cut a birthday cake on the location of his film The Great Father near Thrissur and later at a public function. Mammootty had also shared the first poster of The Great Father on his Facebook a day ago. Mammootty’s son Dulquer Salmaan is also a successful actor and he shared a wonderful note on social media for his father on his birthday. Dulquer Salmaan said, “My dearest vappichi. You are where our family begins. You are the tree that shades us all. And yet I can only imagine one day you were an infant. A baby boy born to Vellupichi and vellummichi after a long wait. You were born for greatness. You were meant to do extraordinary things. And you did all of that. You accomplished everything you dreamed of. Legendary feats. You climbed the tallest of mountains. And at the highest peak you held your family. Safe and sound. Today you are the legend. You are the mountain. And of all the feathers in your cap, your most celebrated is that you are the greatest husband and father ! And we are the luckiest family in the world. Wishing you a very happy birthday as you grow another year younger.”\n\nA handsome Mammootty started his film career in the 1980 and has starred in over 370 films. On his birthday, he arrived at a school near the shooting location of The Great Father and interacted with students, telling them that it was important to do service to the country so that one is remembered by it and not by his or her long life.\n\nA very happy birthday to our beloved Mammuka!
