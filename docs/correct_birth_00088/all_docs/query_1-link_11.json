        "text": "Kozhikode: Have you ever thought of a character in the real life of Mammootty who is similar to barber Balan in the movie ‘Katha Parayumbol’ directed by M Mohanan. Yes, there is a person in his life like Balan. His name is Appukuttan, who Mammootty fondly calls ‘Appuppi’.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nTaking a break from his busy life, the mega star finds delight at his friend’s newly built house in Munnar when he turns 70 on Tuesday. The day is very crucial for both, as the megastar turns 70 and Appuppi celebrates the house warming ceremony of his newly built house with his closest friend on his birthday.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nLike the character Balan in the movie, Appuppi used to wear ear-stud during childhood. Appuppi also has two girl children and a boy. However, Appuppi is not a barber. “We used to go for watching movies with the pennies pooled in and lived as one mind and two bodies. During childhood, there was hardly any day we did not meet. He used to come to my house and I used to visit his. He had a great passion for acting even from childhood. I still remember a long mirror at his house, infront of which he used to practice acting. He wanted me to sit with him during practices to judge his performance.”\n\nGradually, his relationship with Mammootty became very deep and he says he cannot forget him ever in his life.\n\nAppuppi recollects so many incidents in his life when the megastar came up with helping hands.\n\n“His love towards me is unexplainable. When my father fell ill. He used to visit and kept on calling me to know about the health of my father. His stardom was never a burden for him to keep the relationship with me.”\n\nDuring Appuppi’s childhood at Chempu in Vaikom, Mammootty was his neighbour and their childhood affection continues to flow uninterruptedly.\n\n“There is an inseparable bond of affection between me and Mammootty. Mammootty’s house was very close to my house. I am two years elder to him. When he was studying at 10th standard at Government High School Kulashekharamangalam in Chempu, I was doing my pre-degree. I was not good at my studies and failed in pre-degree. However, he excelled in his studies and became a lawyer. But it never stood in the way of our relationship. Even during his college time, I used to accompany him. When he started practicing at Manchery court, he asked me to accompany him and managed to get a job for me there.”\n\nHis companionship with Appuppi never ended and now he manages a cardamom estate of Mammootty in Munnar. Even after becoming an actor, Mammootty always found time to take care of him. As Mammootty's fame scaled greater heights so grew their friendship . \"He took me even to Dubai during his stage programmes there. He is so kind-hearted to all. My life wouldn’t have become this beautiful without him. Me and my family are ever grateful to him for helping us in many instances.”"
