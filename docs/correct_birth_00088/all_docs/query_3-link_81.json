        "text": "Malayalam actor Mammootty is facing online harassment over his character in the film 'Puzhu' released in 2022. He has been facing cyberattacks from some right-wing sympathisers online. A section of people on social media claimed that the film was anti-Brahmanical.\n\nThis began after the film director Ratheena P T's husband stated in a recent interview that the film aimed to insult the upper-caste Hindu community.\n\nIn 'Puzhu', Mammootty played the role of an upper-caste Brahmin who opposes his sister’s marriage to a lower-caste person. Some of those attacking the actor online, used Mammootty's birth name, Muhammed Kutty, to criticise the national award-winning actor. 'Puzhu' was was a psychological drama directed by debutant filmmaker Ratheena P T.\n\nSome right-wing pages also called for a boycott of the upcoming films of the actor, who has appeared in more than 400 films.\n\nAs the controversy intensified, political leaders, including ministers, came out in support of the actor.\n\nState Revenue Minister K Rajan asserted that Mammootty is “the pride of Malayalis, and he will always remain so”. “The Sangh politics of calling Mammootty as Muhammad Kutty, Director Kamal as Kamaluddin, and Vijay as Joseph Vijay is useless here. This is Kerala,” he said.\n\nCongress General Secretary KC Venugopal said that the “secular society of Kerala will not subscribe to the Sangh Parivar narrative, no matter how hard they try to label Mammootty, who has a clear political view and acting sense”. “Mammootty is the first among the actors who gave Malayalam cinema an identity in world cinema with his acting excellence in a career spanning half a century,” he added.\n\n“When Malayalam cinema is going through the historical stages of its growth, most times Mammootty has been able to overcome the weaknesses by shouldering it all alone. Such a personality cannot be tied to the framework of any religion or caste,” he wrote on Facebook.\n\nSenior CPM leader and Education Minister V Sivankutty shared a photo of himself with the actor and said these attempts will have no space in Kerala.\n\nThe actor, who has won three national awards among many other recognitions, has not commented on the matter."
