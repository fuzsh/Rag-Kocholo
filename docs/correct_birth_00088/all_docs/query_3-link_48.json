        "text": "MUSCAT: Age is just a number and no one proves it better than the Malayalam film industry’s veteran actor, Mammootty. The 70-year-old Indian actor has been hitting it out of the park with ace performances in one-of-a-kind movies.\n\nIn an interview with The Cue, Mammootty nonchalantly said, “It is only our body that ages but not our thoughts. I do not wish for it either. Our thoughts, desires and perspectives may have limitations but they should be evolving.”\n\nHe added, “I am not a so-called born actor. I had a desire to act and after doing it repetitively, I have refined my acting skills. If I continue acting, I may keep getting better at it.”\n\nAfter donning the role of Michel in Bheeshmaparvamand Sethurama Iyer in CBI 5- The Brain, Mammootty playing a helicopter dad in Puzhu has caught the attention of his admirers. Set to release exclusively on OTT platform SonyLiv on May 12, Puzhu has become the talk of the town.\n\nWhy is there a buzz around this movie you ask? For plenty of reasons, we say. It is the first time the megastar has collaborated with a debutante female director Ratheena PT on an ambitious project, portraying an antagonistic role with many shades of grey.\n\nDespite the chatter around the fact that it’s the National award-winning actor’s premier collaboration with a female director, in an interview with Mathrubhumi, he has emphasised, “Gender doesn’t matter. All directors say start, action and cut without any difference. Everyone has their perseverance and commanding powers. She did her role in the best way.”\n\n“In the past, directors and producers used to ask for our dates. Now they say: Can you hear a story? That is a big transformational change in Malayalam cinema. And now, cinema has become a collective vision rather than a director’s lone vision and that’s how meaningful movies are made,” he added.\n\nPuzhu also features Parvathy Thiruvothu, Athmiya Rajan, Malavika Menon, Nedumudi Venu and Indrans. Undawriter Harshad and Varathan writers, Suhas and Sharfu have penned the script for Puzhu. The movie is financed by Mammootty’s son, Dulquer Salmaan and S George, under Wayfarer Films and CynCill Celluloid banners."
