        "text": "Muhammed Kutty, better known by his screen name Mammootty, is a very popular Indian film actor. He has acted in more than three hundred films, most of them in Malayalam cinema. Mammootty is the recipient of three National film awards for Best Actor, six State awards and six Filmfare awards in the \"best actor\" category. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1998. Mammootty is also the current Chairman of Malayalam Communications, which runs some of the popular Malayalam TV channels.\n\nBiography\n\nMammootty was born on September 7, 1953 at Vaikom in Kottayam district of Kerala, India. He has two younger brothers, Ibrahim and Zakariah; and three sisters, Ameena, Sauda and Shafina. He received his education from Maharaja's College, Ernakulam and then studied law at Ernakulam Government Law College. It was during his days at Maharajah's that he got his first role in Anubhavangal Paalichakal (1971). He also practised as a lawyer for some time in Manjeri, Kerala. He married Sulfath in 1981 and has a daughter and a son.\n\nActing career\n\nHis first film as an actor, Devalokam, was not released in theatres. Famous writer and auteur M. T. Vasudevan Nair and Film director K. G. George played an important part in blooming his career.His first film as the hero was played in the movie \"Thrishna\" directed by the veteran director I.V.Sasi,who had also directed his come back film \"Aavanaazhi\".His \"New Delhi\" also played great amount of importance in his life as an actor. His talent was noticed in films like Vilkanundu Swapnangal directed by M T Vasudevan Nair and films like Mela and Yavanika, by K.G George.\n\nOne thing that sets Mammootty apart from his contemporaries is the fact that from the beginning itself, he has been able to treat both art-house cinema and commercial potboilers with ease. He made his mark during the early period of his career itself by enacting roles in films of stalwarts like M. T. Vasudevan Nair, K.G. George, Padmarajan, P.N. Menon, and Bharathan. Later on his talent was utilised by internationally renowned directors like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, T. V. Chandran, and Pavithran. He was a regular in movies of Harikumar, Mohan, et al. The movies by M.T. Vasudevan Nair and Padmarajan, arguably among the best of Malayalam writer-directors, widened Mammootty's acting horizon.It was also noticed that the M.T-I.V.Sasi combo had always worked wonders in Mammooty's films.\n\nTwo of M.T. Vasudevan's films with autobiographical elements were acted by Mammootty - Aksharangal (I.V. Sasi) and Sukrutham (Harikumar).\n\nThe film New Delhi directed by Joshy was a turning point in his career. The film was based on the novel, \"The Almighty\" by Irving Wallace. His portrayal of a victimized journalist, who systematically took revenge on politicians who beguiled him, was noticed and well accepted well by the masses. By then he had achieved superstardom.\n\nHis Oru CBI Diary Kurippu was also a major landmark in the history of Malayalam Cinema. It brought to fore a new concept of an investigative thriller, fresh presentation of politicians and above all a refreshing idea of the hero.The film went on to create box-office history in Kerala.\n\nFollowing the success of the first CBI film three more murder mysteries sequels were produced with the same cast of characters: Jagratha (1989), Sethurama Iyer CBI (2004) and Nerariyan C.B.I (2005, all directed by K Madhu, with Mammootty as Sethurama Iyer, an intelligent but unassuming CBI officer.\n\nMammootty touched the pinnacle of his career in Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha (roughly translated as 'A northern heroic folklore'), again an M. T. Vasudevan Nair creation. His depiction of a Chekavan of distinguished valour but vilified by circumstances won him the top honours of the country, National Award for best acting. His histrionics matched the literary genius of M. T. in each and every minute detail.\n\nIt was his acting talent, coupled with his willingness to go to any extent to rationally portray the roles, that enabled him to act in both offbeat and commercial movies.\n\nMammootty became almost a regular face in Adoor Gopalakrishnan's films. He starred in three of his movies, Anantharam('Thenceforth'), Mathilukal('Walls') and Vidheyan ('The Servile'). The easiness with which he illustrated on screen the protagonist in Mathilukkal(based on Mathilukal, a novel by the Malayalam literary genius Vaikom Muhammad Basheer) was also instrumental in getting him his first National Award for Best Actor. His performance in two commercially off-beat movies, Ponthan Mada by TV Chandran, and Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Vidheyan won him the award for the second time. His performance in \"Ambedkar\", an English movie by Jabbar Patel, won him the National award for a third time. He is also a recipient of Padma Shri, one of the highest civilian awards in India.\n\nMammootty had briefly crossed the boundaries of Malayalam cinema and acted in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi films. Though he proved only a moderate success in Tamil after Mani Ratnam's Thalapathi, his fan following is on par with other Tamil film stars. His notable successes in Tamil include Anandam by Linguswamy and Kandukondain Kandukondain by Rajiv Menon. However, his maiden Hindi film, Dhartiputra went unnoticed. Mammootty, nonetheless made his presence felt on the national level with the biographical film on Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Directed by Jabbar Patel.\n\nThough he has been criticised as unable to portray comic roles, his latest movies Rajamanikyam,Balram Vs Tharadas, Thommanum Makkalum,Thuruppugulan and Maayavi gave a fitting reply to critics. Mammootty, though a hugely popular star, is an exception in Indian films where dancing skills have to be a necessary part of an actor's repertoire. But the emotion and the depth that he lends to his characters makes him a well revered actor and makes up for his shortcomings.\n\nTrivia\n\n* Mammootty plays hero in real life. Mamootty and Dubai-based businessman M.A. Yusuf Ali met with the officials of the Dubai Internet City (DIC) and finally - the proposed Smart City project at Kochi is now within striking distance of the investment-starved state. This project could potentially bring over 90,000 jobs to Kerala.\n\n* Mammootty met with an accident on 19.02.07 on the sets of Amal Neerad's Big B that could have even cost his life. A dummy bomb used during the shoot exploded sending an iron rod flying towards him. He managed to dodge away in time. The shoot was stopped immediately.\n\n* Mammootty is the only second star after Prem Nazir to complete 300 films as the hero in Malayalam. Mammootty reached this feat as he completed his latest film with Renjith titled Kaiyoppu.\n\n* In malayalam movie history, the first star fan club was started in the name of Mammootty in 1989.\n\n* Mammootty also holds the rare distinction of appearing as hero in an astonishing 35 movies released in a single year, 1986, a feat exceeded only by Prem Nazir who acted in 39 movies as hero released during 1979.\n\n* In what is believed to be the first time in the banking history in south India, Mammootty was appointed as brand ambassador by Kerala-based South Indian Bank on 16 October 2006. The Bank chairman said this was taking into consideration the huge following Mammootty enjoys among the NRIs and his image as a clean, pan-Indian actor.\n\n* He is the Patron of the Pain and Palliative Care Society, a charitable organization in Kerala formed with the aim of improving the quality of life among patients with advanced cancer.\n\n* Akshaya, the prestigious Information Technology dissemination project of the Government of Kerala, has Mammootty as the star campaigner. He formally took over as the Goodwill Ambassador of Akshaya on February 26 at a video networked programme which was linked to all the district headquarters of the state. Mammootty will take up the responsibility of spearheading a campaign by appearing in print and visual media advertisements and other publicity materials that will send the message of Akshaya to the grassroots.\n\n* \"Mathilukal (The Walls) has been shown in almost 40 international film festivals beginning with Venice. Among my films, it is Mathilukal which has invited the maximum number of internaional honours. The sincere co-operation by Mammootty, the actor has played a major role in the success of the movie\" - Adoor Gopalakrishnan.\n\n* There was a rumour prevailing that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) would field him for one of the three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala during June 26 elections. Later on the news subsided as Mammootty denied any such possibility. However, Mammootty is known to be close to the CPI-M. He is the chairman of Kairali television channel in which the CPI-M has a high stake.\n\n* He was offered to act as Coca-Cola's brand ambassador/Model in Kerala during March 2004. But, pressure from various quarters, it seems, has prompted the Megastar to give up the ambitious offer. Several environmental groups were calling for the soft drink's boycott.\n\n* He recently published a book Kazhchapadu (perspectives), a compilation of articles he had penned for a column in the largest ciruclated Malayalam newspaper Malayala Manorama. M.T.Vasudevan Nair the doyen of Malayalam writers and a personal friend of Mammootty released the book published by Current Books, Trichur to C.V. Sreeraman.\n\n* His remarks during the 2006 IIFA Awards ceremony held at Dubai had gained a lot of media and public attention. He openly criticised the organisers of the IIFA awards for completely ignoring South Indian films. Mammootty suggested that the Bollywood film industry stand up to competition from the South Indian film industry before calling itself international. Take into account that South Indians have won 14 out of 26 National Film Awards over that many years (Mammootty has himself won it thrice, Amitabh Bachchan twice, Shahrukh Khan never!) and that a significant number of Hindi films are remakes of successful South Indian films — Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam. And these include all old record-breaking Telugu and Tamil remakes. He boldly made comments like, Indian cinema is not just Bollywood, and Hindi is not the only language. Why should our films be called South Indian cinema instead of being under the banner of Indian films?\n\nAwards and honours\n\nNational Awards\n\n* 1989 Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, Mathilukal (Actor)\n\n* 1993 Vidheyan, Ponthanmada (Actor)\n\n* 1998 Dr. Ambedkar (Actor)\n\nState Awards\n\n* 1981 Ahimsa (Supporting Actor)\n\n* 1984 Adiyozhukkukal (Actor)\n\n* 1985 Yathra, Nirakkoottu (Special Award)\n\n* 1989 Oru Vadakkan Veeragadha, Mahayaanam, Mrigaya (Actor)\n\n* 1993 Valsalyam, Vidheyan,Ponthanmada (Actor)\n\n* 2004 Kazhcha (Actor)\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n* 1984 Adiyozhukkukal\n\n* 1985 Yathra, Nirakkoottu\n\n* 1990 Mathilukal\n\n* 1991 Amaram\n\n* 1997 Boothakannadi\n\n* 2001 Arayannangalude Veedu\n\n* 2004 Kazhcha (Actor)\n\nFilm critics\n\n* 1982 Yavanika (Supporting Actor)\n\n* 1984 Aksharangal, Kanamarayathu\n\n* 1985 Yathra, Nirakkoottu\n\n* 1987 Thaniyavarthanam, New Delhi\n\n* 1989 Mathilukal, Mrigaya, Oru Vadakkan Veeragadha\n\n* 1992 Sooryamanasam, Aayirappara, Pappayudey Swantham Appose\n\n* 1994 Sukritham\n\n* 1997 Boothakannadi (Special Award)\n\n* 2004 Chalachitra Ratnam\n\n* 2006 Karutha Pakshikal\n\nVanitha Awards\n\n* 2004 Best Actor Kazhcha\n\n* 2005 BoxOfficeHero\n\n* 2006 Best Actor Karutthapakshikal & Kaiyyopu\n\nOther awards\n\n* V.
