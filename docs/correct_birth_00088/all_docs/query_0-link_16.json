        "text": "Biography\n\nMammootty Profile – Overview\n\nBirth Name Muhammad Kutty Ismail Paniparambil Date of Birth 7 September 1951 in Chempu, Kottayam, Kerala, India Height 5′ 10″ (178 cm) Parents Ismail\n\nFatima Spouse(s) Sulfath Kutty (1980 - present) Children Surumi\n\nDulquer Salmaan Sibling(s) Ibrahim Panaparambil\n\nShafina Panaparambil\n\nZakariah Panaparambil\n\nSauda Panaparambil\n\nAmeena Panaparambil Relative(s) Maqbool Salmaan (Nephew)\n\nMammootty – Biography\n\nMuhammad Kutty Ismail Paniparambil (Mammootty) has acted in more than 360 films. He holds the record for the 2nd highest number of lead roles in Indian cinema after Prem Nazir. He is the only actor to win National Awards in 2 different languages. He acts mostly in Malayalam films but has made appearances in other languages like Tamil (Azhagan, Thalapathy, Anandham, Kilipechu Kekava, Kandukondein Kandukondein), Telugu (Swathi Kiranam), Kannada (Shikkari) and Hindi (Dhartiputra, Thriyatri, Sau Jhoot Ek Sach) as well.\n\nDespite making his technical debut in 1971, it was from 1978 that Mammootty started doing proper characters. He attained stardom in 1982 through Yavanika and from then on has been one of the rulers of the Malayalam Film Industry. Mammootty had a rough patch in 1985-86 when he had to suffer a series of failures. But through ‘New Delhi’, he made a strong commercial comeback and thereafter he hasn’t had to look back. ‘Yavanika’, ‘Inspector Balram’, ‘New Delhi’, ‘The King’, ‘Oru Vadakkan Veera Gaadha’, ‘Hitler’, ‘Pazhassi Raja’, ‘Rajamanikyam’, ‘Oru CBI Diarykuruppu’ etc are some of Mammootty’s biggest box office hits.\n\nMammotty is married to Sulfath and the couple has two children, elder daughter named Surumi who is married and a younger son Dulquar Salmaan who too has married recently and has starred in 3 films already in the industry. Dulquer is already rated as the next superstar."
