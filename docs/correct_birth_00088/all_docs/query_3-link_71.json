        "text": "Adam Sabiq, the actor who played the younger version of Mammootty’s character in ‘Abraham Ozler’, would never have imagined the response he would get for his work in his debut movie. The actor says his phone has not stopped ringing since ‘Ozler’ hit the theatres last week. “I’m receiving a lot of love. It’s truly a dream come true moment for me,” says Sabiq, who hails from Muvattapuzha.\n\nMidhun Manuel Thomas’s team was looking for someone who could play young Alexander in the movie and Sabiq fit the bill. “Midhun sir has a clear cut vision about his film and characters. Mammootty sir essayed the older version of Alexander and I played his younger self during his college days. I was told to keep the same rhythm and mannerisms of the senior Alexander,” says Sabiq.\n\nSabiq says Midhun Manuel is a friend, an older brother and a mentor. “I met Midhun Manuel Thomas in 2019, a month before ‘Anjaam Pathira’ hit theatres. I introduced myself and told him about my willingness to work in his films. I met him again this year and the rest you know is history. Midhun is a great mentor and older brother. Sometimes, he is really strict. Other times, he treats you like a friend,” says Sabiq.\n\nFilms, according to Sabiq, have always been a passion. “I was addicted to cinema and TV shows as a kid. I particularly liked watching Tamil movies. As I grew up, I started dreaming about a career in films. I never had a Plan B. If I had, I never would have made it to films,” he says.\n\nSaqib kept his film debut a secret from his friends and family. “I didn’t even inform my parents about my casting in ‘Ozler’. I would leave the house telling my parents that I was acting in an advertisement. I would then keep my phone silent for several hours. My friends were getting a little worried since I would not pick their calls at the film location. This went on for a month. However, one of my friends found out when someone tagged me on Instagram at the ‘Ozler’ location. That’s how everyone in my town learnt about my acting debut,” he says, adding that he wanted to keep his debut a secret till the film hit theatres. “I wanted to keep everything low-key since it was my debut work. Nevertheless, I am happy with the way things worked out,” he adds.\n\nSabiq, who has worked in short films and advertisements in the past, says he has a lot of people to thank in his journey till date. “The film’s creative director Prince Joy is one person I am thankful to. Though I did not have any previous experience acting in movies, he showed immense faith in me,” he says.\n\nSabiq also recalls his interaction with Mammootty and Jayaram. “Neither me nor my co-actors shared any screen space with these stars at the film set. However, we met them during the press meets. Jayaram was particularly sweet and would go out of his way to make us comfortable. It was so humbling,” he says."
