        "text": "Read the version published on The Hindu on April 2, 2023.\n\n“There are two Mammoottys,” says veteran filmmaker Sathyan Anthikkad. “One corporeal, whom we see and assume to know, and the other, a spectre shadowing the former, closely observing him. The superstar is a carefully crafted project designed by a relentless self-critic.”\n\nYou might sense traces of this quality scattered throughout his public appearances, where he eloquently reflects on his craft and the world around him. He once admitted to being deeply embarrassed by his performances in his early films. “I realised everything I knew about acting was folly”, he wrote in his memoir. At film promotional events, he steers conversations towards the art and technology of cinema. “It is not make-believe,” he interrupted a journalist in an interview last May while discussing an actor’s transformation into a character. “An actor should believe.” To become a character is to enter the mould of an entire life lived by another person, he said, and elucidated how he decided that Raghavan in Munnariyippu (2014) would not swing his arms.\n\nMammootty, 71, has been acting for over five decades, a period long enough for a celebrity in a culture of incredible flux to fade into obscurity. However, he has not only endured the test of time but is currently in one of the most exciting phases of his career.\n\nIn contrast to his co-superstars in south India like Mohanlal, Rajinikanth or Chiranjeevi, he seems unruffled by the transformations cinema has undergone during the Covid-affected years. His recent filmography is an excellent mix of mainstream entertainers and smaller auteurist projects. In January this year, he delivered a terrific performance in Lijo Jose Pellissery’s Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam as James, a Malayali man who metamorphoses one afternoon into a stranger and begins to live a life hitherto unknown to him. Mammootty delves into the core of this transformation and richly animates the oneiric melding of the two souls. The film was produced by him under his newly launched banner, Mammootty Kampany, and distributed by his son, Dulquer Salmaan, who is one of the most bankable young stars in south India.\n\nWith around 420 films in six different languages, his filmography stands tall and continues to expand. Last year, he headlined two top-grossing Malayalam movies – Bheeshma Parvam, an ersatz Godfather directed by Amal Neerad, in which he starred as the patriarch of a Christian family in Fort Kochi, and Rorschach, a revenge-drama directed by Nissam Basheer. His upcoming film line-up includes Jeo Baby’s Kaathal: The Core and Roby Verghese Raj’s Kannur Squad.\n\nHis popularity is at an all-time peak, transcending the simplistic paeans for his rugged handsomeness, smooth skin and baritone to an awe-inspiring admiration for his ability to remain contemporary. Once mildly derided, his obsession with cutting-edge electronic goods is now emblematic of his youthful spirit. What was once seen as narcissistic behaviour is now celebrated as a manifestation of his self-possession.\n\n“Mammootty has always remained a man of today,” says Jeo Baby. “When I say he is a young man, I am not referring to his physical fitness but his interest in the world around him. He is constantly refurbishing himself as a social being”.\n\nBorn as Muhammad Kutty in Chandiroor, Alappuzha, in 1951, Mammootty was 20 when he first appeared in a movie, as a junior artist in KS Sethumadhavan’s iconic film Anubhavangal Palichakal (1971). A few minor roles later, he landed his breakthrough role in KG George’s Mela (1980). By then, he was a grown man, married, and had a degree in law.\n\nUnlike Mohanlal, the other superstar in the Malayalam film industry who began his career around the same time, Mammootty did not burst into Malayalam cinema as a spectacle exuding erotic charm. He is a force accrued over time, a constant work-in-progress. At the end of the 1970s, the film industry was in transition. The old guard of leading men had declined, and Mammootty and Mohanlal emerged as the dominant masculine figures on the screen. They led from the front as Malayalam cinema passed through its golden era over the next decade.\n\n“The presence of Mammootty and Mohanlal boosted the confidence of the film industry,” says Anthikkad. “They could and were willing to play all kinds of characters. They were crowd-pullers who could act exceptionally well.”\n\nIn the 1980s, Mammootty collaborated with a diverse range of writers and filmmakers, including Adoor Gopalakrishnan, IV Sasi, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Joshiy, Dennis Joseph, Pavithran, Padmarajan, Anthikkad and SN Swamy, among others, to create a solid body of work that earned him the superstar title and critical recognition. He was at his most prolific during this decade, starring in a staggering 30 films in 1986 alone, a number that by today’s standards seems unattainable. In 1987, New Delhi, written by Dennis Joseph and directed by Joshiy, famously revived his career from a deadly slump, becoming the most legendary anecdote in the dramatic narrative of his star trajectory.\n\nMammootty’s enduring collaboration with MT Vasudevan Nair, the Jnanpith-winning writer-filmmaker, has resulted in numerous exceptional films such as Trishna (1981), Aalkkottathil Thaniye (1984), and Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha (1989). The actor once wrote that MT was the “dowser who sensed the presence of an abundant spring of artistic talent within him.” They first met in Ernakulam at the end of the 1970s, where Mammootty was living as a young lawyer with the ambition of becoming an actor. Impressed by his demeanour, MT cast him as a labour union leader in Devalokam in 1979. The film was left unfinished due to financial constraints, but MT helped Mammootty secure his first acting credit in his next writing project, Vilkkanundu Swapnangal (1980), directed by his former assistant, Azad.\n\nMammootty’s resonant voice is one of his greatest assets, even though it may have contributed to the perception that he was matured beyond his age early on in his career, thus keeping lighthearted, romantic roles away. His colleagues attest that his perfection in voice modulation is the result of rigorous training. Anthikkad narrates an incident from the end of the 1980s when Mammootty had just signed on to play the legendary Chanthu in Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha. “He offered me a ride from Ernakulam to Thrissur in his car, and throughout the journey, a recording of MT reading out the screenplay played in a loop on his cassette player. He was studying how the writer had metered those lines”.\n\nMammootty’s silences are as evocative as the vocal shifts he creates, says filmmaker Salim Ahmed whose Pathemari (2015) ends with a compelling monologue delivered by the actor who portrays in the film the harrowing life of a Malayali immigrant in the UAE.\n\nOne of the finest voice actors Malayalam cinema has ever seen, he has brought to the screen a variety of regional accents with incredible accuracy. He spoke flawless suburban Thiruvananthapuram slang in Rajamanikyam (2005), a comedy helmed by Anwar Rasheed and effortlessly slipped into a Thrissur slang in Pranchiyettan And The Saint (2010), directed by Ranjith. These films marked a significant shift in his career as he departed from the hypermasculine template that had dominated the Malayalam film industry in the late 90s and early 2000s, in which he was a prominent figure. He subverted the macho hero by injecting into this construct a grand dose of humour.\n\nThere was a slew of silly formulaic movies, but the period around the onset of the millennium was not entirely bleak. In fact, in 1998, Mammootty won his third national award, for his performance in Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, an English language film. In 1997, he starred in Lohithadas’ magnificent Bhoothakkannadi, and in 2000, in Rajiv Menon’s Kandukondein Kandukondein, an adaptation of Jane Austen’s Sense And Sensibility, he played a decommissioned soldier with an amputated leg and a heart full of resentment. He stood out as an oddball in a pool of young beauty, and walked away with the best moments in the film.\n\nEven as he appears to be baring himself in front of the public, there is clearly a part of Mammootty that he keeps carefully guarded. Meena T Pillai, film critic and academic, notes that this reticence fuels his star persona. “Mohanlal’s fandom comes out of an approachability, while Mammootty remains reticent, enigmatic. His persona is intimidating, it is beyond your reach. If Mohanlal is about playfulness, Mammootty is about stoicity. You want to touch him,, but you can’t. He is a star beyond your grasp.This gels with the expectations of the fans. It fans fandom.”\n\nSometime in the mid-90s, he started to shy away from playing his age on the screen, which helped him prolong his status as a reigning megastar. His mammoth fanbase has grown into an uncontainable beast that launches into violent attacks on his critics. Actress Parvathy came to the receiving end of the vilest of such cyberattacks in December 2017, after she, at a public event, termed a scene from his film Kasaba (2016) misogynist and slammed his choice to be part of it. The megastar maintained a wall of silence as the young actress suffered verbal abuse and even rape and death threats on social media platforms for weeks.\n\nWhile his colleagues describe him as a habitual do-gooder involved in unpublicised charity missions, Mammootty appears chary when it comes to airing his views on political issues or the patriarchal nature of the film industry. Perhaps, it is not part of the design he has crafted for himself.\n\n“Mammootty is driven solely by his desire for success in movies,” remarks Anthikkad. “He is in perpetual, greedy pursuit of good characters to play. Over the years, he has transformed himself into a tool for filmmakers and writers to use. He does not have a life away from cinema.”\n\nMany years ago, in the pre-OTT era, Mammootty appeared in a television interview hosted by director Ranjith. Leaning back on a couch with his legs crossed, he spoke about a time when he set out to direct a film based on a screenplay by the late writer-filmmaker Lohithadas. “However, my enthusiasm vapourised soon,” he said, laughing at his own naïveté. Then his voice fell into a familiar melancholy as he continued, “All those people who gave me those magnificent characters have departed. I am now without any wealth.” He pauses to smile, and in the tenderness of it, you sense the actor vanishing and the human being seeping in through the cracks."
