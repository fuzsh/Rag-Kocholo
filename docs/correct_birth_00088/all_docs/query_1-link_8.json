Extension,\n\nRaja Annamalaipuram,\n\nChennai-28.\n\nMammootty is a popular Indian Actor. Mammootty has acted in more than 300 films in\n\nMalayalam and Tamil. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1998.\n\nMammootty was born in Chempu, near Vaikom, Kottayam district in a middle class family.\n\nHis father Ismail was an agriculturist and mother Fatima a housewife. Along with his\n\nsiblings he grew up in Chempu.\n\nDuring his school life he participated in sports and arts. He studied Pre-degree at\n\nMaharajas College, Kochi and later studied at Ernakulam Government Law College. It was\n\nduring his days at Maharajah's that he got his first role in Anubhavangal Paalichakal in\n\n1971. He was also a known mimicry artist. While at law school he and his friends streaked\n\nthrough the streets of Ernakulam as part of a bet.\n\nIn Manjeri he practiced as a criminal lawyer for two years but he was a man of many\n\ninterests. ?I have always wanted to be a writer, and had been writing even when I was\n\na student. I hadn't published anything though, after trying to be a singer and a writer\n\nthen only I became an actor? he said.\n\nMammootty married Sulfath in 1980 and as they believe in film world, he started getting\n\nprominent roles. He has a daughter, Surumi (born 1982) and a son Dulquar Salman (born 1986).\n\nFrom 1982 to 1986 Mammootty acted in more than 150 films as hero. During this period,\n\nhe has managed the rare distinction of appearing as the hero in an astonishing 35 movies\n\nreleased in the year 1986. But these also lead to a career slump.\n\nA lesser known fact is that he owned a production company ?Casino? during 1980s, along\n\nwith Mohanlal, I.V. Sasi, Seema and Century Kochumon. The production house produced\n\ncommercially successful films such as Nadodikkattu, Gandhi Nagar 2nd Street, Adiyozhukkukal and Karimpin Poovinakkare.\n\nAlong with Mohanlal he was the most prominent leading male actor in Malayalam movies\n\nfrom 80?s. During a career spanning more than quarter of a century, he has acted in more\n\nthan 300 films as the lead actor in Malayalam movies, a distinction he shares with\n\nPrem Nazir.\n\nThis trendy film icon is considered getting younger after each passing day. A survey\n\nconducted by Vanitha magazine among its readers, selected Mammootty as the actor with\n\nmost sex appeal. Mammootty is widely considered in film circles as manliness epitomized.\n\nHis profound looks, baritone voice and thick moustache underline his masculinity.\n\nMammootty is a youth icon and is a known techy. He is the first Indian actor to start a\n\nwebsite. He is known to have fascination for camera, electronic goods and sun glasses.\n\nWhile not acting he is seen with laptop. No wonder he is the Goodwill Ambassador of the\n\nAkshaya project.\n\nKnown for his short temperedness, Mammootty is good at spotting talents. He gave exposure\n\nto Lal Jose, Blessy, Anwar Rasheed, Amal Neerad and now to Renjith Shankar who directed\n\nPassenger.\n\nMammootty is considered by many critics to be one of the finest actors in Indian cinema\n\nwho excels in art as well as mainstream films. In each of his films he brings a fresh new\n\npersonality.\n\nHe is the only actor apart from Kamal Haasan to win National Film Award for Best Actor\n\nthree times. In 1998, the Government of India honored him with Padma Shri for his\n\ncontributions to Indian cinema.\n\nIIFA honored him by conducting a hit parade in Dubai in 2005.The University of Kerala\n\nhonored him with honorary doctorate in 2008.\n\nThis gifted actor has promoted humanitarian causes through out Kerala and is a Patron\n\nof the Pain and Palliative Care Society; a charitable organization formed with the aim\n\nof improving the life of patients with advanced cancer and chronic pain.\n\nHe is counted amongst the most talented actors of Indian Cinema, Mammootty; the Mega\n\nStar of Malayalam Movies captivates the audience with his looks and talent.\n\nFilm Career\n\nHis film career began with the Malayalam movie Vilkanundu Swapnangal by K.S Sethumadhavan\n\nin which his performance was noticed by the colossal writer in Malayalam cinema\n\nM T Vasudevan Nair, who cast him in yet unfinished film Devalokam.\n\nMammootty's mentor K.G. George made him a bankable superstar. K.G George?s films like\n\nYavanika and Valarthu Mrigangal made him noticeable.\n\nHis career saw a spectacular rise after the release of Joshi?s New Delhi. It heralded\n\nthe arrival of super star Mammootty.\n\nIn 90?s Mammootty became a regular face in Adoor Gopalakrishnan films. He starred in\n\nAnantharam, Mathilukkal and Vidheyan.\n\nA Folklore tale, Hariharan's Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, Mammootty portrayed Chanthu which\n\nbagged him first National Award for the Best Actor.\n\nIt can be said that he made it almost a habit of winning the national award.\n\nPonthan Mada won him national award for a third time.\n\nHis controlled acting, abiding the limits, and presentation of dialogues, which were\n\npregnant with meaning, gave Malayalam cinema a new concept of hero.\n\nMammootty is considered to be one of the greatest Method Actors in India along with\n\nNasirudeen Shah and Om Puri.\n\nThree national awards, five State awards many Filmfare awards all for best acting assert\n\nhis acting prowess.\n\nHis Oru CBI Diary Kurippu was a landmark. His representation of a Tamil Brahmin CBI\n\nofficer stays in everyone?s mind. A fifth film with the same character is set to be made\n\nimmediately which is a record of sorts in the Malayalam film industry, movies with the\n\nsame lead character a la James Bond.\n\nHe proved a success in Tamil with Mani Ratnam?s Dalapati and continued to shine in Tamil\n\nfilms. His maiden Hindi film is Thriyathri released in 1989. As hero Dhartiputra went unnoticed. His national presence was felt with Jabbar Patel?s Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar. He bagged the coveted Rajat Kamal for best acting.\n\nEarlier he was considered not good for comedy scenes and dancing. With his talent\n\nstreaming in right direction he is now the best man to do comedy. In the dancing front\n\nhe still has to improve as he still shakes the head even he only need to shake a finger.\n\nMisc\n\nMammootty is also the Chairman of Malayalam Communications, which runs Malayalam TV\n\nchannels like Kairali TV, People TV and We TV.\n\nMammootty has turned writer with his book Kazhchapadu, a compilation of essays written\n\nin various publications."
