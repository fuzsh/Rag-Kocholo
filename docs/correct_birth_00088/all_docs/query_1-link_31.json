But after it he got a role among the crowd in the film Anubhavangal Paalichakal, he got the acting bug.\n\nApart from Malayalam, he did films in other languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, English and Kannada.\n\nIn 1998, he was honoured with the prestigious Padma Shri Award.\n\nHe also has received National Film Award thrice.\n\nThere was a period in late 70s when he was looking for a big hit. In 1981 he used his official name as Sajin for a film to bring good luck.\n\nIn 2000, he played the role of B. R. Ambedkar in an English film Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, but initially he was reluctant to do this role as he did’t want to remove his moustache.\n\nOnce McAfee, an American computer security software company listed him as the Most Dangerous Celebrity as his searches can end with a virus on computer as cyber criminals were targeting him.\n\nHe loves writing and wrote a book called Kaazhchappadu (perspective). He also used to write a weekly column in Malayalam Manorama on his experiences.\n\nHe has played double roles in more than 15 films.\n\nHe is the brand ambassador of Kerala Volleyball League, and he even used to play it in his younger days.\n\nHe is very active in charity works and supports Street India Movement, Pain and Palliative Care Society, etc.\n\nMammootty’s love for cars is evident through his car collection. Sources suggest that during the early years of his career, he owned a briefcase with a lock bearing the number 369. Due to his fascination with multiples of 3, Mammootty ended up using ‘369’ as the registration number for all his cars.\n\nHe has a distribution company called Mammootty Technotainment.\n\nIn October 2023, the Parliament of Australia released personalised stamps featuring Mammootty at a ceremony held in the Australian Parliament in Canberra. The stamps were released by the Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese, the Member of the Australian House of Representatives Andrew Charlton, and the High Commissioner of India to Australia Manpreet Vohra. About 1,000 stamps were launched in collaboration with the Australia India Business Council (AIBC)."
