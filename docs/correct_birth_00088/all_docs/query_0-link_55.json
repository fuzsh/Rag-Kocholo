        "text": "Mammootty is one of the prominent actors in Malayalam cinema and has shown his acting mettle with Kaathal-The Core, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and others. However, do you know that he was in a different occupation before making great strides in the field of acting? Mammootty’s fans would be surprised to know that he used to practice law before he became one of the most sought-after actors in Malayalam cinema.\n\nBorn in Chempu village, the 72-year-old actor had even practised law for 2 years after he graduated with an LLB degree from the Ernakulam Law College. He completed his graduation in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2023, the veteran actor had even posted a video from his college classroom where he spent his final year. “Alma Matter\", the 72-year-old actor wrote in the caption while sharing the view of the classroom. He further talked about the classroom in Malayalam and added, “This was my final year classroom when I was studying here. They don’t take classes here anymore. We would hold our moot court and conduct small art programmes.\" Mammootty added that this classroom had once been the Cochin State Assembly Hall.\n\nAs of now, Mammootty is dominating the headlines for his latest released film Turbo. This was billed to be his first full-fledged mass entertainer after 2022’s Bheeshma Parvam. Besides Mammookka, Turbo also features Raj B Shetty, Anjana Jayaprakash, Kabir Duhan Singh and others in prominent roles. Turbo has received mixed to poor reviews from the audience and critics. As per the critics, the film falters in the writing aspect despite Mammookka’s ability to engage the viewers.\n\nIn addition to these films, the Kaathal-The Core actor has many other films to his acting credit. He will next play the leading man in the movie Bazooka, written and directed by Deeno Dennis. Bazooka stars an ensemble star cast of actors Gautham Vasudev Menon, Shine Tom Chacko, Hakkim Shah and others. Saregama India, Theatre of Dreams and Yoodle Films have produced Bazooka. This film is currently in the post-production phase and can be released in 2024."
