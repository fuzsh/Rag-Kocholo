        "text": "Two years ago, actor Nivin Pauly gave a book to his friend, Jude Anthany Joseph. It was the 300-page autobiography of Mollywood superstar Mammooty called Chamayangaliillade (Sans any make-up). When Jude began reading it, he found it so interesting, he could not stop. He read through the night. Next day, Jude told Nivin that he could make a film. Nivin said, “That’s why I gave you the book.”\n\nSince Jude was an unknown, he decided to make a 12-minute short film. “I felt I could do some scenes from Mammooty’s childhood,” says Jude.\n\nTo do research, the debutant director went to Mammooty’s village in Chempu, in Kottayam district. “I pretended to be a journalist to the locals,” he says. Jude took photos of Mammooty’s shuttered house, the school where he studied, and other places of interest.\n\nHe also met Mammooty’s school teacher Sahadevan and his wife Nalini, who are still teaching. “Sahadevan sir told me Mammooty was always interested in the arts from a young age,” says Jude.\n\nIn fact, in a scene from the film, Mamookka’s Biography, which can be seen on YouTube, the teacher asked the students what they wanted to be when they grew up. A couple of students listed the professions of policeman and chief minister. But, one boy, to the shock of the teacher and his classmates, said he wanted to be an actor.\n\nThe 10-year-old boy, MA Jeyasuriyaa, who played the younger Mammooty, was an inspired selection. Jude saw him at a drama club and quickly noted his acting talent. In the film, Jeyasuriyaa looked confident and mischievous.\n\nOne day, he saw a postman riding a bicycle near his school. He asked him whether he was going to deliver letters to his home that day. The man nodded. Then, impishly, the junior Mammooty asked the postman if he could carry his school books, along with the letters, and give them to his mother, while he went out to play.\n\nBut there were disappointments too. To get a role in a play conducted by the school drama club, senior students asked for 50 paise. Mammooty managed to persuade his father to give him money. But when Mammooty met the senior students, they told him his closest friend had paid the money and got the role. Mammooty felt crushed.\n\nIt is an inspiring story, nevertheless. “Who could have imagined that this boy from a village would become a megastar of Malayalam cinema,” says Jude.\n\nIn April, 2012, Jude showed the film to Mammooty in his trailer during a shoot at Kochi. “He liked many aspects,” says Jude. “I told him I wanted to make a full-length film. Immediately, Mammooty asked me to write a screenplay. Jude is busy with that at present.\n\nMeanwhile, two months ago, Jude released his first feature, Ohm Shanti Oshana, which stars Nivin and Nazriya Nazim in lead roles. It is an endearing love story between youngsters. And it has become a super-hit.\n\nBut Jude seems to be an unlikely candidate to make an impact at the box-office. An electronics engineer, he worked for three years at Infosys, Bangalore. But he had always nurtured a dream to be a film director. “I watched a movie every day on the computer for years together,” he says. “I learnt direction like that.”"
