        "text": "The Asian elephant Elephas maximus is currently re-colonizing the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal. We studied their impact on woody vegetation in the nutrient-rich floodplain and in the relatively nutrient-poor sal forest. The types and extent of tree impact were recorded along fixed-width transects (335 km). Species composition, density and size classes ≥8 cm diameter breast height (dbh) were recorded in 15-m radius random plots (n=95). Impact was higher in the floodplain complex than in the sal-dominated forest. Our hypothesis that elephants were more selective on species in the nutrient-poor sal forest was only partly supported; the niche breadth of impacted trees was slightly higher in the floodplain complex. Pushed-over trees accounted for the highest proportion of impact (55%), followed by killed trees (39%). Of the pushed trees, 10% were not used for food. Among food trees, elephants selectively impacted size class 12–16 cm dbh, whereas non-food trees were impacted independently of size. A large proportion of the freshly browsed trees had been felled previously, indicating that most felled trees survived, enabling elephants to feed on them again. This may reflect an evolutionary adaptation among long-lived species with high site fidelity. Owing to preferential use but low abundance, two species in sal forest, Grewia spp. and Desmodium oojeinense, were found to be particularly vulnerable to local extinction due to elephants. Although the elephants had impacted a large number of species (62, 73% of all), 56.4% of the impacted trees consisted of Mallotus phillippinensis. A recently observed increase in the density of M. phillippinensis and the concurrent reduction of the hardly utilized Shorea robusta indicates that the rapidly growing elephant population may modify the composition of the forest by increasing its preferred food species.\n\np>Initial assessment of cost and benefit aspect to the community managed forest for biodiversity conservation was conducted in Baghmara Community Forest at central lowland Nepal. Wildlife was being colonizing and forest was in early succession stage. The area was potential habitat for large wildlife too. Cost-benefit analysis indicated more cost than benefit during the initial stage. Eco-tourism was initiated after a few conservation management efforts in the area that resulted the numbers of tourist influx which will be on profit in near future. J. Nat. Hist. Mus. Vol. 26, 2012: 163-174</p\n\nOwing to landclearing and human expansion, Asian elephantElephas maximus Linnaeus, 1758 is declining throughout its range. In lowland Nepal, the species now only occurs in small remnant populations, shared with India. In order to develop guidelines for conserving the species in the country, we studied the habitat use of a small and recently re-established population in Bardia National Park. We used the distribution of dung in fixed width transects to estimate seasonal habitat selection at a general scale of the Park. We also analyzed a specific habitat selection by elephants within the sal-dominated forest, by comparing the composition of trees and frequency of previous elephant impact on them along fresh tracks with those at random points. Elephants strongly preferred floodplain communities both during the cool and the hot season, but there was a marked shift from forest to grass-dominated subtypes between these seasons. Within the sal-dominated forest, there were more trees with previous elephant impact and a higher density of important food trees, especiallyMallotus phillippinensis along fresh tracks than in random points. We found little if any effect of human activity or location of available water on the spatial distribution of elephant dung. The density of the colonizing population was low (ca 0.2 animals/km2), but numbers are expected to increase in the future. With the preferred floodplain habitat being quite small (ca 60 km2), animals are then expected to spread outside the national park. A large tract of government forest adjacent to the park may then, for some time, provide needed space for the expanding population. Key words Mallotus phillippinensis -Asia-floodplain-habitat preference-megaherbivores-patch selection-subtropical forest\n\nAsian elephants Elephas maximus are an endangered species and human—elephant conflict (HEC) is the major threat to their survival. HEC causes crop and property loss and occasionally results in the death of both humans and elephants in Nepal. Elephants are responsible for more than 40% of the human—wildlife conflict, 70% of the wildlife-caused human casualties, and a 25% loss in crop production in Nepal. Identification of the factors associated with elephant invasion can help mitigate conflict by allowing residents and representatives to address those factors. This study used face-to-face interviews in 1182 households in villages affected by elephants in southern Nepal using a structured questionnaire to understand how land-use practices are related to HEC regionally. Almost all (99%) of the surveyed houses had some damage from elephants within the past five years. A stepwise binary logistic regression showed that practices such as the growing of traditional crops (rice and large maize fields), maintaining bananas, and home alcohol production increase the chances of elephant attacks. Our data also revealed that HEC is most intense in winter months, when rice is harvested. People residing near protected areas had positive attitudes towards elephants, as they received economic benefits from ecotourism and improved mitigation practices such as electric fences. Changing some land-use practices could reduce HEC in the region. Therefore, alternative crops should be explored to reduce HEC in southern Nepal. Other management recommendations include moving fruit trees away from homes or fencing community orchards. Although home alcohol production is illegal in Nepal, those engaging in the practice should not ferment alcohol in their homes. Finally, growing bamboo on the edge of settlements would engage elephants and allow for a response to repel them before severe crop or house damage occurs.\n\nElephant-woodland interactions at the Nazinga Game Ranch in south-central Burkina Faso, West Africa, were studied. The ranch covers 940 km2 of tallgrass Combretum/Terminalia woodland. The density of tree and shrub stems abobe 1 m tall averaged approximately 800/ha, and remained relatively unchanged at densities from 0 to 0·6 elephants/km2. At higher elephant densities, woody-stem density was sharply reduced. At low elephant densities (less than 0·6 elephants/km2), the size distribution of woody stems had on increased proportion of larger trees compared with the stratum containing no elephants. The highest density of elephants (2·5/km2) showed no further changes in the size-class distribution of trees and shrubs, but a change in species composition was apparent with increasing proportions of species of low palatability for elephants. An elephant density between 0·5 and 0·6/km2 is suggested to keep major short-term vegetation changes to a minimum."
