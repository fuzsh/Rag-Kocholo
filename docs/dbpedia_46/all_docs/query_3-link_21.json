        "text": "A general analysis and overview of forest biodiversity is presented. Some important current topics will also strengthen the overall overview of assessment and monitoring of biodiversity. Emphasis has been given to the three main components related to biodiversity. Analysis, assessment and monitoring of forest biodiversity have been presented. A list of processes generating and maintaining biodiversity have been presented as well. Main key factors and indicators of forest biodiversity have been described. Silvicultural and management treatments creating disturbances and mimicking natural processes are highly important for preserving high quality of forest biodiversity. Management of biological diversity (including genetic diversity) has also been highlighted as an important part of silviculture and forest management. Finally, some important concluding remarks have been presented.\n\nTree species inventories, particularly of poorly known dry deciduous forests, are needed to protect and restore forests in degraded landscapes. A study of forest stand structure, and species diversity and density of trees with girth at breast height (GBH) ≥10 cm was conducted in four management zones of Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) in the Eastern Ghats of Southern India. We identified 128 tree species belonging to 45 families in 7.9 hectares. However, 44 species were represented by ≤ 2 individuals. Mean diversity values per site for the dry forest of BNP were: tree composition (23.8 ±7.6), plant density (100.69 ± 40.02), species diversity (2.56 ± 0.44) and species richness (10.48 ± 4.05). Tree diversity was not significantly different (P>0.05) across the four management zones in the park. However, the number of tree species identified significantly (P<0.05) increased with increasing number of sampling sites, but majority of the species were captured. Similarly, there were significant variations (p<0.05) between tree diameter class distributions. Juveniles accounted for 87% of the tree population. The structure of the forest was not homogeneous, with sections ranging from poorly structured to highly stratified configurations. The study suggests that there was moderate tree diversity in the tropical dry thorn forest of Bannerghatta National Park, but the forest was relatively young.\n\nFor 12 years, Biodiversity: Research and Conservation has been publishing scientific articles in the area of taxonomy, chorology, ecology and nature protection. In accordance with the journal’s profile adopted from the very beginning, the subject of publications are plants in the wide, traditional perspective of this group of organisms, as well as fungi and lichens. Over 12 years, 345 scientific articles were published in the journal’s pages. The frequency in individual sections is as follows: Variability, taxonomy and phylogeny – 95, Chorology – 92, Ecology – 79, Nature protection – 51, other topics – 28. The authors of these articles are 468 scientists from 28 countries. To ensure a high level of publications, the submitted works are send for review. To date, 171 scientists specializing in biological diversity research participated in the review process. Biodiversity: Research and Conservation, published at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (Poland), is open for the authors..."
