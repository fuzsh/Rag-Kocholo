        "text": "The aim of this study was to know the commonly available medicinal plants and to document their usages. Study was carried out around periphery of 'Gyaneswor Community Forest' of Bharatpur-16 of Chitwan district of Nepal. Altogether, forty household were selected by random sampling, and key informant interview was carried out with community forest personnel's and leading farmers. Most of the respondents of Bharatpur-16 were found to be dependent on medicinal plants for their primary health care. Because of no side effect, easy availability and cost effectiveness of medicinal plants, most people were found satisfied using it. However, the use of and preference for medicinal plant was found limited to minor diseases only. The findings of this study revealed that there are many medicinal plants in our periphery that can be used as an alternative for allopathic medicines, but they need to be systematically managed and conserved.\n\nThis article scopes the status and potential of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in community forests and the national forest of Bardiya district in western Nepal. The human ecological approach, participatory rural appraisal, focus group discussions and interviews were used to gather data and information for analysis. The results of the data analysis indicate that the area harbours a high diversity of potential NTFPs. Altogether, 101 species and their traditional uses were recorded. The NTFP species are clustered into first, second, third and fourth categories on the basis of their market value and resource availability. Despite a gradual but systematic socio-cultural transformation of the local communities, they still possess ample knowledge of plants and their uses. It is observed that the proper management of the NTFPs could play a vital role in the improvement of people's livelihood on a sustainable basis."
