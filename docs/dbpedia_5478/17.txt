Solna is one of Stockholm’s most dynamic municipalities. It is home to the national football arena, a university hospital engaged in world-leading research and Scandinavia’s largest shopping centre.

In Solna, we can satisfy our customers’ need for greater flexibility by upgrading our older properties, and we can offer a growing portfolio through extensive new construction. Our properties are mainly located in the districts of Arenastaden, including Haga Norra, and Solna Business Park.
