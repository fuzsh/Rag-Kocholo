        "text": "The 27‐year‐old heir to the Swedish crown, prepared for his position since early child hood, has mounted the throne in the waning of its power and glory and with his life's work still to be done.\n\nThe average Swede has no strong impression of the new King. Neither the efforts of the popular press to present Crown Prince Carl Gus tar as a “swing ing future king, nor those of the palace scribes to make his official biography the story of a serious apprentice king diverted only by healthy, character‐building outdoor sports, have made a convinc ing imprint.\n\nMan in the News\n\nThe Swedes think of Carl Gustaf as a pleasant, some what timid youth who is often photographed dancing with well‐born girls at a pop ular discotheque or raising a glass at the garden party of an aristocratic family, while earnestly preparing himself for a destiny of serv ice as an inactive symbol.\n\nUnder a new constitutional provision likely to become effective Jan. 1, 1975, the King of Sweden will be stripped of even the present semblance of having a say in affairs of state.\n\nCarl Gustaf became pre destined for the throne at the age of 4, when his great grandfather, King Gustav V, died and his grandfather, who died on Saturday, ascended the throne. Carl Gustaf's fa ther, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, died in a plane crash in 1947, shortly before his only son's first birthday.\n\nOnly Male Heirs\n\nThe Swedish throne belongs to the male descendants of the ruler, and this placed the new King ahead of his four older sisters. His mother, the German Princess Sibylla of Saxe‐Coburg‐Gotha, died last November.\n\nCarl Gustaf was schooled at the royal court until he entered a private boarding school in Sigtuna near the capital. He graduated in 1966 with grades somewhat below average and he had been chosen a member of the rifle team.\n\nThe Crown Prince spent the following two years serving in the various branches of the armed forces, with em phasis on the navy. He was commissioned in 1968. After attending the cadet schools of the army and air force and after several weeks' serv ice with the coast artillery, he also received captaincies in those branches.\n\nHe then pursued his aca demic career, with two se mesters at the University of Uppsala. He spent one term studying history and sociol ogy, the second political sci ence and economics.\n\nSystematic Study of Nation\n\nSince his university days, Carl Gustaf has devoted him self to a systematic study of the structure and functioning of Sweden. He began with the Stockholm County ad ministration and its branches and continued with local au thorities in the provinces. He then spent time with the Labor Market Board, the Board of Agriculture and the National Environment Pro tection Board.\n\nIn 1970, the Crown Prince studied the working of vari ous industrial enterprises here and in the provinces. He also observed the workings of co operatives, the board of edu cation, the courts and the national police board and headed the Swedish delega tion at Sweden Day at the Osaka World Fair. Later that year he spent a month in New York to study the Unit ed Nations at work.\n\nThe Crown Prince devoted the rest of 1970 to a study of the Swedish press, the Swedish church and the thanking system.\n\nAfter observing the work of various ministries, the Par liament and the royal chan cery, he spent two periods in London last year, observing the functioning of a private bank and the Swedish Chem ber of Commerce. Concur qently, he participated in the ;training course for candidates for the diplomatic service, studied economics at Stock holm University and pursued his military training.\n\nWhile attending the com mend course at the Royal Na tional Defense College last month, the Crown Prince was called to the bedside of his dying Grandfather, King ‘Gustaf VI Adolf, and stayed ‘with him until his death.\n\nBrought up without a fa ther, the new King was drawn close to his grandfather. From the time that Carl Gustaf reached the age of 25—the Minimum age for the kings of Sweden—the late King in creasingly placed royal bur dens on his successor.\n\nCarl Gustaf was called upon to, act as regent while his grandfather pursued his archeological studies in Italy. He received the credentials of foreign ambassadors and Acted as host at official luncheons. The Crown Prince came to international atten tion last year, when he re placed his indisposed grand father at the ceremony for the bestowal of Nobel Prizes.\n\nThe new King—who has assumed the name Carl XVI Gustaf—is of medium height and curly and rather longish of hair. But a court official declared emphatically that he was no “hippie” although “modern” of outlook and “in formal” of speech.\n\nAccording to an aide, King Carl XVI Gustaf—he is the 16th Carl and by Swedish custom the number appears between his two names—was restraining his tendency to portliness, caused by a liking for French and Italian food and the appropriate wines, by exercise.\n\nBut the new King enjoys the outdoors, likes to hunt and fish, loves animals and spent some time recently pre paring a deer park at a castle he owns in the south. He also enjoys practical jokes and can take one. He did not flinch recently when a friend, to whom he presented a ski ing trophy after a race, ac cepted a handshake by squeezing a sticky cream cake into the Crown Prince's hand.\n\nDespite the photographs in discotheques and frequent rumors of romance, palace officials said they knew of no likely candidate to become Queen of Sweden."
