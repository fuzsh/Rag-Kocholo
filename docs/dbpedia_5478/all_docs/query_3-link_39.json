First there was a shallow engraving, then there was a deep engraving. I think I have both types here, but I'm not sure.\n\nDoes anyone here has knowlegde about this or liks to info?\n\nMichel SE 356A\n\nScott SE 418\n\nYvert et Tellier SE 355\n\nStanley Gibbons SE 318\n\nAFA number SE 365\n\nFacit SE 399A\n\nPost by youpiao on\n\ntobben63 I tried to find information about this, but came up with nothing. I did find this blog about the series, which you may be aware of, but for which I will post the link for the benefit of others:\n\nswedishdefinitives.blogspot.com/p/gustav-vi-adolf-type-i.html\n\nThe author makes mention of the shallow engraving, but does not address the subject of re-engraving, only that other colors were tried out.\n\nI found the informaation on this series fascinating. Please keep us updated on anything you find out about the re-engraving.\n\nTed\n\nPost by tobben63 on\n\nyoupiao thanks a lot for the link, was not aware if this blog.\n\nI will investigate furter on these stamps. My best refference for now is the Facit catalogue, but I will sercth the internet for resources. Maybe the library in my local stamp club has something, but it is now closed for the summer. I will be nack ðŸ˜Š\n\nPost by tobben63 on\n\nI have not found more info regarding the two engravings on the first 10Ã¸re green Gustaf VI stamp.\n\nBut I have sorted mine (roughly) to what I think the two engravings must be. The two upper rows I'm most sure of, the rest I'm not that confident. There could be shallow engravings with good or har print and deep engravings with light print.\n\nScanned at 1200dpi, click on image to go to better resolution.\n\nEdit, I had to splitt image to several images do to file size.\n\nPost by vikingeck on\n\nAll too deep for me. I limit myself to the perf/imperfs as listed in Facit. A B AB and C.\n\nWith mint and used that gives me half a dozen or so...........................\n\n.\n\n....more than enough!\n\nPost by tobben63 on\n\nI have done that up to now vikingeck , but I got a huge load with Swedish definitives in a auction lot. So to justify the bid on a (not to good lot) I started to look closer to some of them and discovered the engravings differences decribed in Facit.\n\nI have nearly all of Gustaf VI Adolf from before, but only collected as Lighthouse set them up. That means I dont have collected the single stamps with various perforation sides, just pairs. And only used stamps.\n\nAsample on the side Im making. Putting a image of the stamp in first box when I start with a new stamp number.\n\nPost by darkormex on\n\nA question for tobben63..is it common practice to collect Swedish coils in pairs rather than singles or is it collector preference? Does Facit list them this way or is it just how your Lighthouse album has them laid out? I had a Facit catalogue a long time ago but sold it at one time or another.\n\nPost by khj on\n\nA question for tobben63 ..is it common practice to collect Swedish coils in pairs rather than singles or is it collector preference?

In the US, we collect coil pairs and booklet singles. But in Europe, you find they will collect coil singles and booklet pairs.\n\nI didn't know that until I got my first European made Scandinavia-area album. That's when I noticed it in FACIT. Some of those older booklet pairs on cover are worth more than the mint pairs.\n\nPost by darkormex on\n\nA question for tobben63 ..is it common practice to collect Swedish coils in pairs rather than singles or is it collector preference?

I was reading the thread this morning and sitting here with some Swedish stamps I had soaked which included a coil pair of a later definitive issue (not the Gustav in this thread) so it made me pause....thinking that I should not separate the two stamps.\n\nPost by tobben63 on\n\nkhj answered the question correct darkormex. Coil pairs are common but not collected if not there is something special with them ore they have a nice postmark as fare as I know.\n\nLighthouse arrange them as on the picture I posted. I have now made pages with the Gustaf VI Adolf Definitives with all the ways Facit describe.\n\nPost by khj on\n\nI should also clarify, there are some Swedish TÃªte-bÃªche coils, which obviously must be collected as pairs or multiples. That's something you don't see in the US.\n\nAlso, there are specialists who do collect Scandinavian coil pairs/multiples, in general. I forgot who, but I was told by one collector that a few of the early coils are really difficult to find in pairs/multiples. Facit doesn't list general coil pairs, but apparently those who specialize in them know which of the early coil multiples are difficult to get.\n\nPost by darkormex on\n\nkhj answered the question correct darkormex .

Steiner doesn't arrange them this way on his pages but that's okay. One less stamp collecting rule to worry about!"
