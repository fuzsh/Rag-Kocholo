sweet with friends.\n\nThis simple coffee break is enjoyed by people of all ages and is something that is traditionally taken with colleagues, friends and family.\n\nFika has been around in Sweden since the 18th century when coffee was first brought to the country.\n\nFollowing the introduction of patisserie in the 19th century, Swedes combined flaky pastry treats with their coffee, taking a purposeful moment to savour the experience.\n\nThe most popular treat to have during fika is a cinnamon bun, a lightly spiced swirl of dough often topped with a sweet icing.\n\nFika has become so

is well-known for its leafy landscapes and forested hills.\n\nThe country is large in size but has a relatively small population of around 10 million residents, allowing it to preserve and nurture its green spaces.\n\nThe natural landscape of Sweden is covered in vast swathes of forest, and adding to this natural beauty are its 90,000 lakes, shore line and pebble beaches.\n\nSweden’s forests make up 1% of the world’s forested lands, however despite this small number the country is the second largest exporter of wood-based products in the world.\n\nSwedish pulp, paper and sawn woods are shipped across the world for use in a variety of industries.\n\nOf the 40.8 million hectares that make up Sweden, its forests cover a staggering 22.5 million hectares with trees including spruce, pine and birch.\n\nAs a country that prides itself on its sustainability initiatives, Sweden has sustainable forests that are replanted with species following felling, and that focus on the growth of indigenous species of trees.\n\nRecommended tour: Stockholm: Forest Mountain Biking Adventure for Beginners.\n\n8- Vikings\n\nOne of the most well-known and famous things about Sweden is its Viking heritage.\n\nBetween the 8th and 11th centuries this fierce group of warriors, traders and settlers spread out across Europe.\n\nThe Viking Age in Sweden began in around AD700, however much of their travelling and fighting across Europe came much later.\n\nThe Vikings originated from modern-day Sweden and were a part of the larger Norse region, which also covered Denmark and Norway.\n\nVikings from Sweden were considered master shipbuilders and navigators, creating powerful and fast moving long ships.\n\nDue to the creation of these ships, the Vikings were able to easily move around the world and travelled extensively.\n\nDespite popular belief, not all Viking voyages were to pillage.\n\nMany trips across Europe were to open trading routes to allow the Vikings to connect with the British Isles, the Baltic and the Byzantine Empires.\n\nWhen Vikings settled in areas outside of Scandinavia, they introduced their traditional customs on the lands they arrived in, which gave countries such as Great Britain an influence of Norse mythology in their medieval writings.\n\nIn Sweden today there are clear reminders of the countries Viking heritage.\n\nThe legacy is shared through numerous museums and galleries dedicated to the Vikings and their influence not only on Scandinavia, but across much of Northern Europe.\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nStockholm: The Viking Museum Exhibition and Viking Ride.\n\nFrom Stockholm: Viking Culture Guided Tour with Transfer.\n\n9- Smorgasbord\n\nOne of the most famous things to enjoy eating in Sweden is a smorgasbord.\n\nThe term is used to describe a large buffet of various different items, typically consumed at large family gatherings or festivals.\n\nSmorgasbords often consist of both hot and cold dishes, with guests expected to contribute something to the table.\n\nThe literal definition of a smorgasbord comes from the terms used in Sweden for both open sandwich, however today it is customary to have a varied and plentiful spread.\n\nTraditional smorgasbords include cold dishes typically featuring a variety of sea food including prawns, cured salmon and pickled herrings.\n\nOther cold items may include hard boiled eggs, slices of cold meats, pickles, pates and condiments.\n\nWarm and hot dishes are served during winter and include meatballs, rich and creamy mashed potatoes, roasted meats and miniature sausages.\n\nThese warm dishes tend to be replaced by chilled ones during the summer months, such as tarts and cheeses.\n\nSmorgasbords also feature sweet dishes to finish the meal in the form of marzipan sweets, chocolates, or desserts using berries.\n\nAt Christmas, the traditional smorgasbord is elevated into a julbord, which follows the same structure but with more festive additions.\n\nExpect find a potato gratin, fondues and spiced cookies on the julbord spread.\n\n10- Avicii\n\nOne of the most famous and most popular musicians to come out of Sweden was DJ

warships from the 17th century.\n\nIn 1625 Gustav II Adolf had Henrik Hybertsson, a Dutch shipbuilder, begin designs on a warship, with the aim of creating one of the most formidable and powerful ships in the Baltic.\n\nFollowing Hybertsson’s death in 1627, the warship was ready to launch.\n\nIt measures 69m (226ft) in length and 50m (164ft) in height, weighed 1200 tonnes and had 10 sails and 64 cannons.\n\nDespite the fanfare around the ships launch, its maiden voyage was fated to be its last.\n\nAfter ignoring worries from Sofring Hansson, the ships captain, around the alarming rolling of the ship, the Vice Admiral Klas Flemming was pressured into launching the vessel by the king.\n\nThe maiden voyage of Vasa should have been a sight to behold, however after making it a mere 1300m (4265ft) from the ship yard, a strong gust of wind caused the ship to rock leading water to pour through the open gun-ports, swiftly filling it with water.\n\nIt took mere minutes for the ship to sink down to the sea bed.\n\nThere were various attempts to reach the ship during the 1660s, with one successful mission using newly engineered diving bells bringing the majority of the ships cannons back to the surface.\n\nFinally, after centuries of salvage operations, on 24th April 1961 the Vasa warship was finally pulled from the harbour, surprisingly well-intact.\n\nIt was displayed in the February of the following year in the former shipyard where it was first built.\n\nIn the decades that followed extensive restorations have allowed the ship to be as well-preserved as possible.\n\n1990 saw Vasa’s story continuing as it was moved to a new and more permanent home dedicated to the fated ship and its history.\n\nSince moving to the Vasa Warship Museum, Vasa has drawn thousands of interested visitors from across the globe to admire this huge warship."
