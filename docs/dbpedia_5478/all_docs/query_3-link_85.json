        "text": "1939 started off badly for the Danish Royal Family. Reports informing the public that all was not well began to appear in the newspapers in the beginning of January. Prince Waldemar, who had only two months earlier celebrated his 80th birthday with a large family gathering in Copenhagen, had been taken ill. According to the reports he had caught flu and was so poorly that he had had to remain in bed. Doctors had been sent for but according to the bulletins issued by them there was not much hope for a safe recovery. On January 11th it was reported that Prince Waldemar’s eldest son Prince Aage, who was serving in the French Foreign Legion in Morocco, had been granted leave and was hastily returning back to Denmark to be at his father’s bedside. Princess Aage, who resided in Rome at that moment, had also been taken ill with flu and was thus not able to make it back to Denmark. Prince Renée of Bourbon-Parma, Prince Waldemar’s son-in-law, was also reported having difficulties travelling to Denmark as he had had a toboggan accident in San Moritz. He had suffered an injury to his face necessitating several stitches and hospitalisation. The doctors treating him would not allow the Prince to travel in that condition at that moment.\n\nThose of Prince Waldemar’s children who were already present in Copenhagen attended on him at his sickbed at the Yellow Palace, Prince Waldemar’s residence in the centre of Copenhagen. So did his nephew and close friend Prince George of Greece.\n\nPrince Aage finally arrived in Copenhagen on January 13th, at 19:35. He had travelled the last stretch of his journey across Europe on the express train service from Hamburg. At the train station to meet him were his son Count Waldemar of Rosenborg and his brother Prince Erik. As soon as they arrived the Palace the Prince ran up the stairs to his father’s bedroom. Prince Waldemar had by this time been drifting in and out of consciousness and he was not even able to speak due to his lack of strength. When his eldest son entered the bedroom Prince Waldemar had opened his eyes and those present were convinced that the old man had indeed recognised his son.\n\nNow all his children were gathered around the dying man which must have brought them comfort. They remained in the rooms adjoining the Prince’s bedroom and stayed awake during most of the night. When they finally managed to get some rest they slept fully clothed in case they were quickly called to the sickbed.\n\nThe last three days a doctor had stayed at the Palace to be close at hand. At 8:30 he saw the signs showing that the end was near and he alerted the family. Only five minutes later the old Prince took his last breath.\n\nHalf an hour later, after the resident doctor and two more doctors had signed the death certificate, the flag flying on top of the Yellow Palace was lowered down to half mast. As the newspapers had already covered the illness of the Prince it did not come to a great shock to the citizens of Copenhagen to see the flag at half mast. The King had already been informed and at the same time as the flag was lowered His Majesty arrived at the Yellow Palace. During the day he would come by no less than three times and he was deeply moved by the demise of his uncle. The Queen was unable to accompany him as she had also had to take to bed due to a heavy cold.\n\nAlready that same day it was announced that the Royal funeral would take place only a few days later, on Wednesday 18th. Also a short service was held at the Yellow Palace that same afternoon. It took place in the large salon with windows towards Amaliegade (Amalie Street). The provost at Holmen Church Michael Neiiendam officiated. The small group of people who had gathered for the ceremony sang a hymn. All members of the Danish Family who were present in Copenhagen had come to show their respects, except the Queen as she was still confined to bed. Present were also the entire staff connected to the Yellow Palace and the Prince’s country residence Bernstorff as well as the Prince’s close personal friend Vice-Admiral Amdrup.\n\nThe coffin with the remains of Prince Waldemar would rest in the large salon at the Yellow Palace for a couple of days before being transferred to Holmen Church.\n\nNews of the Prince’s death spread quickly and already early in the day wreaths and floral arrangements, both from family and strangers, arrived at the Yellow Palace and they were placed around the coffin. Outside the Palace people walking by stopped and paused silently for a moment facing the open windows of the large salon. Throughout the city flags were seen flying at half mast. Not only from public buildings, but even from private homes.\n\nAs soon as the news reached the Swedish Royal Court the King declared Court Mourning for 8 days. At the Danish Court Court Morning was set to four weeks. The Norwegian Court was in fact still in mourning for Queen Maud who had died in November but announced that they would at the same time observe a three weeks’ Court Mourning in respect of the King’s uncle.\n\nTuesday, January 17th\n\nOn Tuesday evening the coffin with the remains of the late Prince was moved from the Yellow Palace to the Holmen Church. Many people had gathered in front of the Palace in spite of the rain. A forest of umbrellas was thus the sight which met the Royal Family and their guests when they arrived.\n\nA Royal Guard had been placed at each side of the doors leading into the Palace. Outside a detachment from the Life Guards under the command of Captain Henningsen had taken up position with drums and their Standard. Riding police officers had been charged with keeping order though it had hardly been necessary as the people who had gathered to show their support to the bereaved family were very respectful and no trouble was caused by anyone.\n\nAt precisely seven o’clock, with the church bells in the Marble Church near Amalienborg Palace marking the hour, the large frontal doors of the Yellow Palace opened. Slowly the Standard of the Guard of Honour was lowered but the drums remained silent. Then the hearse drawn by two horses dressed in black appeared. The hearse was also covered by black drapes with gold trimmings and golden crown embroidered onto it.\n\nInstead of taking cover from the rain and follow the coffin in closed cars the Royal mourners decided to follow of the coffin by foot. Thus, immediately behind the hearse, dressed in black coats and top hats, came His Majesty the King of Denmark and His Royal Highness Prince George of Greece. They were followed by the late Prince’s children accompanied by those of their spouses who were present in Copenhagen. Some of his eldest grandchildren were also there, including Their Highnesses Princes George and Flemming and Prince Erik’s daughter Countess Alexandra of Rosenborg. Also joining the mourners were His Royal Highness the Duke of Guise, the Duke of Magenta and Prince and Princess Radziwill. Vice-Admiral Amdrup, a close friend of the late Prince since their younger days, also followed the coffin on its last journey from the home which the Prince had loved so much.\n\nThe procession slowly made its way through the streets of Copenhagen towards Holmen Church which was lit up almost like a beacon in the dark and raining evening. When the hearse arrived at its destination the church’s provost Neiiendam came out to meet it. Under the tolling of bells the coffin was carried inside by His Majesty, Prince George, Prince Aage, Prince Axel, Prince Erik and Prince Viggo, Vice-Admiral Amdrup and two of the faithful servants of the late Prince Mr Carlsen, Butler, and Mr Larsen, Chauffeur.\n\nInside the church a prelude sounded softly as the coffin was carried up the aisle and placed on top of the catafalque. It was a very short and dignified ceremony just like the late Prince had wanted. Only fifteen minutes later the majority of the mourners left the church with only Prince Axel, Princess Margrethe and Prince René staying behind a few more minutes.\n\nWednesday, January 18th\n\nOn the day of the funeral a single Royal car was seen pulling up in front of Holmen Church in the early morning hours. It was Prince Axel and Prince Erik who arrived to oversee the last touches on the decoration inside the church. The large quantity of wreaths had been placed close to the coffin and along the aisle. Immediately in front of the catafalque the large laurel wreath from the King and Queen of Denmark had been placed. It bore a ribbon in white and blue with the names used by Prince Waldemar for the King and Queen in private: “Christian and Adini”\n\nApart from the wreaths the whole church was decorated with white lilacs filling it with lovely scent as well as being a beautiful sight. The balustrade separating the choir and nave was covered with lilies-of-the-valley while the altar itself had almost been hidden under a large quantity of white carnations. Wreaths hung on every door leading into the pews. The black trappings traditionally used for Royal funerals had been omitted as much as possible and it was only the flowers, the burning candles and the church walls themselves who helped create the tender and special atmosphere felt as one entered the church.\n\nWreaths had been sent even by people who were not present in person, like for instance Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, King Gustav V of Sweden, the Crown Princely Couple of Sweden, Prince Damrong of Thailand and Prince Oscar Bernadotte.\n\nDraped in the Danish naval flag the coffin had been placed on top of the catafalque in front of the altar. Four naval officers had kept vigil by the catafalque through the night and continued to do so during the funeral service.\n\nAlthough the day had started with rain this did not deter people from gathering outside the church. Already around ten o’clock a crowd began to form behind the police barricades. From eleven o’clock people with access cards to the funeral inside the church began to arrive. At the same time soldiers from the Royal Guard and a Battalion of Marines lined up to form a Guard of Honour. At the church entrance a marine had been placed on each side and each time an officer walked past them to find his seat inside the marines presented arms.\n\nBy half past eleven all the pews except had been filled up. Ten minutes later the large church bells started to toll and the first Royals began to arrive. First to arrive were Prince Harald and Princess Helen together with their children and son-in-laws. Princess Helen’s sister the Princess of Solms-Baruth was with them. They and all the other Royal attendees were shown to their seats by a group of ushers lead by the Master of Ceremonies, Marshal of the Court Juel. Once they had all taken their seats in the choir the church doors were shut. Then the prelude, which had been played softly on the organ during the arrival of the mourners, increased slightly in volume. The provost Michael Neiiendam who had been sitting up at the altar now rose and made his way down the aisle while the doors again opened up. In stepped Their Majesties the King and Queen of Denmark and His Majesty the King of Norway. They were greeted by the provost and accompanied by him up the aisle. The Queen walked between the two Kings. Both brothers were dressed in the uniform of Admirals and they wore the Sash and Star of the Order of the Elephant. As they reached the altar they stopped at the foot of the catafalque and one by one they made a solemn bow towards the coffin before taking their seat.\n\nA hymn was sung before the provost continued with the sermon. Another hymn was sung and the provost stepped towards the coffin on which he threw three small spadefuls of earth. This was followed by the Lord’s Prayer and the blessing of the congregation.\n\nThen twelve lieutenants from the Danish Royal Navy marched slowly up alongside the coffin, six on each side of it, relieving the four officers which had stood guard during the ceremony. The Marshal of the Court also positioned himself immediately in front of the catafalque, facing it for a minute during which there was absolute silence. When the minute had past and he was sure everything was ready for the next part of the ceremony he slowly turned around and started to walk down the aisle. He was followed by the coffin now carried by the twelve lieutenants.\n\nAs this was a family funeral rather than a State funeral it was not the King who walked immediately behind the coffin. Instead it was the late Prince’s nephew and close friend Prince George of Greece who walked in that place. He did so with a bowed head looking pale and truly devastated. The Prince was followed by the Duke of Guise and the deceased’s immediate family. Only after these did the procession continue with the King and Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway and the rest of the Royal mourners.\n\nThe coffin was placed back on the hearse and so began the last journey of Prince Valdemar. A procession was formed which would take the remains through the streets of Copenhagen to the train station where a special train stood ready to bring him to Roskilde Cathedral. Here he would be interred in one of the crypts beside his wife Princess Marie. She had died already back in 1909.\n\nIn front of the hearse marched a Guard of Honour from the Royal Guard. Immediately behind it walked the majority of the male Royal mourners. A detachment of Marines followed next and lastly the rest of the Royal mourners in cars. At this moment Prince George was accompanied by the two Kings, the King of Denmark to his right and the King of Norway on his left.\n\nBoth Kings wore a cape over their uniforms in order to keep out the cold. Prince George did not. He was, like the two Kings, dressed in a naval uniform (most likely a Danish one). Across his chest he wore the pale blue Sash of the Order of the Elephant. Pinned to his uniform tunic he wore the Breast Star of the same Order alongside two other Breast Stars. One of these is most definitely the Breast Star of the Order of the Redeemer, the highest Order in the Kingdom of Greece.\n\nBehind these three nephews of the deceased walked another two uniformed men; his sons Prince Aage and Prince Axel. Both wore the Sash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant. In the next line walked his other two sons, Prince Viggo (also in uniform) and Prince Erik (in a black coat), his son-in-law Prince René and his brother-in-law the Duke of Guise, the two latter also in black coats. Behind them came the late Prince’s grandsons Count Valdemar of Rosenborg (son of Prince Aage), Prince Georg and Prince Flemming (Prince Axel’s two sons)\n\nAn elderly man walking tall in his characteristic blue uniform in the next line is easily recognisable as Prince Carl of Sweden. To his right can be seen the Crown Prince of Denmark and the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Prince Harald of Denmark are seen to his left.\n\nIt gets more difficult to identify Royal mourners the further back in the procession one looks. But Prince Knud is walking behind the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz probably talking to Prince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe. The two boys are most likely Prince Gorm and Prince Oluf. .\n\nOne close member of the family who seems to have been absent from the funeral ceremonies is the late Prince’s nephew Prince Gustav of Denmark.\n\nThe streets making up the route had been covered with branches of cypresses and thujas which released a fresh scent when crushed by the wheels of the hearse and stepped on by the mourners. Thousands of people had lined the streets to show their Prince Valdemar, who was so well-liked, their last respect on his last journey.\n\nAt the railway station the special train awaited and detachments of soldiers had taken up position wearing their dress uniforms and large bearskin caps. As the coffin was carried into the specially prepared train carriage the Royal mourners in uniform, as well as the officers of the military detachments present, saluted it. They then got into their own train carriages and the train was put in motion.\n\nOnce the train arrived at the station in Roskilde the Royal party came onto the platform which had been covered in a red carpet and decorated with laurel trees. The coffin was then carried through the station building and placed onto another hearse. From the bell tower of the Cathedral one could hear the bells starting to toll. Again the procession started to walk slowly towards the Cathedral. The street was lined with people and it was covered with branches of evergreen spruce.\n\nWhen the funeral procession had reached the Cathedral the coffin was carried through the King’s Gate followed by the Royal mourners. It was received by Bishop Axel Rosendahl accompanied by Provost Dr Scharling and the two priests of the Cathedral G. Arnberg and Müller. They then went down to the southern crypt where the coffin was placed next to the white sarcophagus of his late wife Princess Marie.\n\nGuests attending the Royal Funeral (not complete):\n\nHH Prince Aage, Count of Rosenborg (son)\n\nWearing the red dress uniform of the Royal Life Guard\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant (10.06.1905)\n\nHRH Prince Axel of Denmark (son)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Royal Navy\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant (12.08.1906)\n\nHRH Princess Margaretha of Denmark (daughter-in-law)\n\nHH Prince George of Denmark (grandson)\n\nHH Prince Flemming of Denmark (grandson)\n\nHH Prince Erik, Count of Rosenborg (son)\n\nCount Valdemar of Rosenborg (grandson)\n\nCountess Alexandra of Rosenborg (granddaughter)\n\nHH Prince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg (son)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Guard Hussar Regiment\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant (25.12.1911)\n\nHH Princess Viggo, Countess of Rosenborg (daughter-in-law)\n\nHRH Princess René of Bourbon-Parma, Margrethe (daughter)\n\nHRH Prince René of Bourbon-Parma (son-in-law)\n\nHM The King of Denmark, Christian X (nephew)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of an Admiral in the Danish Royal Navy\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant, Neck-tie of the Order of Dannebrog\n\nHM The Queen of Denmark, Alexandrine\n\nHM The King of Norway, Haakon VII (nephew)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of an Admiral in the Danish Royal Navy\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant, Neck-tie of the Order of Dannebrog, Breast Star of the Order of St. Olav\n\nHRH The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Frederick Francis IV\n\nWearing the dress uniform of a General in the Danish Army\n\nNot possible to see what Orders he wore as he wore a cloack over his uniform, but he had been awarded the Order of the Elephant in August 1897 so it is very likely that he wore this)\n\nHRH The Duke of Guise, Jean d’Orléans (brother-in-law)\n\nHRH The Crown Prince of Denmark, Frederick (IX)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Royal Navy\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant (14.05.1912)\n\nHRH The Crown Princess of Denmark, Ingrid\n\nHRH The Crown Princess of Norway, Märtha\n\nHRH Prince George of Greece (nephew)\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Royal Navy (probably)\n\nSash and Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant (15.11.1888), Breast Star of the Order of the Redeemer\n\nHRH Princess George of Greece, Marie\n\nHRH Prince Knud of Denmark\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Royal Navy\n\nSash and Star of the Order of the Elephant (14.05.1912)\n\nHRH Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark\n\nHRH Prince Harald of Denmark\n\nWearing the dress uniform of the Danish Guard Hussar Regiment\n\nSash and Star of the Order of the Elephant (28.07.1894)\n\nHRH Princess Helen of Denmark\n\nHSH Prince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nHH Princess Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe, Feodora\n\nH Ill.
