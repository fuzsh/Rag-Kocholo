        "text": "After Gustav I Vasa was elected to the throne in 1523, he began to restore the power of the Swedish king and to organize a central administration under his own direct leadership. On the one hand, this task was facilitated by the elimination of a great part of the high nobility by the Stockholm Bloodbath. On the other hand, the influence of the king was limited by the economic dependence of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League. In connection with the war against Denmark and the liberation of Stockholm in 1523, Gustav Vasa had been forced to make great concessions to Lübeck, which had given him both economic and military support. In exchange, the merchants of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League were given privileges that created a monopoly of Swedish foreign trade and even had considerable influence on domestic trade and industry. The concessions also included a large payment and left Sweden heavily in debt to Lübeck. Under the mediation of Lübeck, the war with Denmark was brought to an end by a treaty concluded in Malmö in 1524.\n\nAfter the death of the Danish king Frederick I, his son Christian III became king in 1534. When Lübeck attempted at this time to restore the exiled Christian II as king in Denmark, Gustav Vasa gave the young Christian III strong military support in a war against Lübeck. The Hanseatic army was beaten in 1535, and by the terms of a truce in 1536 the Swedish debt to Lübeck was wiped out and the privileges of Lübeck traders were abolished. By this action Hanseatic hegemony was destroyed, other foreign traders were allowed to enter Sweden, and Swedish traders could now move freely beyond the Baltic. Sweden’s relations with Denmark remained peaceful for the rest of Gustav Vasa’s reign.\n\nGustav Vasa devoted the major part of his rule to domestic politics, and he is credited with establishing Sweden as a sovereign state. His initial goal as king was to stabilize the nation’s financial situation. Through stern acts passed by the Diet at Västerås in 1527, he was able to confiscate all the properties of the Roman Catholic Church. The church at that time held 21 percent of Sweden’s land, as opposed to only 6 percent held by the crown. The appropriation of the possessions of the church thus added enormously to the wealth of the state. To some degree the king could justify his actions on the basis of the doctrines of Martin Luther, which were being accepted nationwide with royal encouragement. The Swedish and Roman Catholic churches separated as the Reformation spread, and the Lutheran Swedish church was eventually adopted as the state church. The establishment of the new religious order occurred simultaneously with a reorganization of government, which was accomplished with the assistance of German administrators brought in by Gustav. The new, highly centralized administration attained an unprecedented degree of efficiency.\n\nDuring the latter part of his reign Gustav achieved absolute power and ruled Sweden in accordance with his own precepts. In 1544 the king established a hereditary monarchy in Sweden and accelerated the annexations of land, which finally gave the crown direct possession of about 60 percent of Swedish soil before he died. Gustav Vasa has been compared to a landowner in his behaviour toward the crown properties and the state incomes. He personally took part in developing their administration, and he continuously inspected the crown servants. He nominated county governors himself and reserved the most important charges for members of his own family. Money economy had barely come to Sweden, and many state incomes were therefore paid in kind; some of the goods exchanged were used directly to feed and clothe public servants and soldiers, while others were sold to foreign merchants. Gustav took great pleasure in literally filling the treasury, in which condition it was handed over to his son. The nobility was allowed no part in state affairs, and the Diet was convened only for royal propaganda, of which Gustav was a master. Not surprisingly, Gustav’s new system was not universally accepted. In such regions as Västergötland, Dalarna, and Småland, there was considerable resentment over the imposition of state control. In the 1530s and ’40s the farmers grumbled over taxes, and the clergymen complained about interference in church matters. Gustav met opposition from his former friends—e.g., the farmer-miners of Dalarna—with the same ruthlessness as that from other dissenters. Gustav led a careful foreign policy; nevertheless, a considerable army and a strong navy were created during his reign. Sweden also advanced culturally under Gustav’s rule: among the notable literary accomplishments of the period were a complete translation of the New Testament and the publication of the hymns and theological writings of Olaus Petri, who played an important role in the Swedish Reformation.\n\nFollowing the death of Gustav Vasa, his oldest son, Erik XIV, became king. In his will Gustav had, however, appointed his younger sons dukes and given them part of the realm as duchies with great power in domestic affairs. One of the first steps taken by Erik XIV was to strip his brothers of all power by a treaty that he forced them to sign at Arboga in 1561. The main interest of Erik XIV was, however, devoted to foreign policy. One of his goals was to gain control of Russian trade through the Baltic ports. As a first step he negotiated with the Estonian nobility, which agreed to Swedish rule in 1561 and thereby laid the foundation for a Swedish Baltic empire. His aspirations led to conflicts with Denmark and Lübeck, which, up to the 16th century, had been the leading powers in this region. Control of the Baltic Sea became a central issue. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Baltic region, Europe’s main source of grain, iron, copper, timber, tar, hemp, and furs, was as important as either the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. The Swedish effort to gain control over trade in the Baltic resulted in war with Denmark, Lübeck, and Poland in 1563. After seven bloody years, during which the southern parts of Sweden were ravaged, a peace was signed at Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in 1570, without change to any of the borders. Sweden was forced, however, to pay a large ransom to retrieve the fortress of Älvsborg, its only stronghold in the west. Before the peace was concluded, Erik XIV, accused of lunacy after having murdered some of the leading aristocrats by his own hand, was deposed in 1568 by his brother John, who was supported by the high nobility. Erik later died in prison, probably poisoned on the order of his brother.\n\nWith the support of the high nobility, John III ascended to the throne in 1568. His reign (1568–92) was characterized by conflict between the king and the high nobility, who asked for a constitutional government and greater influence for the council. At the same time, John tried to reintroduce Roman Catholic customs into the Swedish church, which led to conflict with the clergy. His religious policy was a consequence of his marriage to a Polish princess and the subsequent close political alliance between Sweden and Poland. Their son, Sigismund III Vasa, was elected king of Poland in 1587 before inheriting the throne of Sweden in 1592. Opposition to Sigismund developed because of his Roman Catholicism and his extensive stays in Poland. At a meeting in Uppsala in 1593 the clergy adopted a declaration that became the definitive confirmation of Sweden as a Lutheran country. The strong feelings against Sigismund were also exploited by his uncle Charles, who organized all conceivable Swedish opposition against the recognition of Sigismund. By doing so, Charles made the Diet (and of course the clergy) a political force against the high nobility. The final outcome was the resignation of Sigismund in 1599."
