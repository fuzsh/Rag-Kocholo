        "text": "Copenhagen - Thousands of Danes filed past Queen Mother Ingrid's coffin for the third day running on Monday as it lay in state in the chapel of Christiansborg palace in Copenhagen.\n\nMore than 20 000 people had stood for hours in the cold waiting to pay a final, silent tribute to the popular, Swedish-born Ingrid, who died aged 90 at her residence in Fredensborg palace north of the capital last Tuesday after a sudden deterioration of her health.\n\nWrapped in a flag with the royal coat of arms, Ingrid's coffin was placed on public display in \"castrum doloris\" on Friday, following its transportation in a cortege from Fredensborg to Christianborg, the seat of the Danish parliament, on Friday evening.\n\n\"Castrum doloris\", introduced in the German empire in the early 16th century, was first adopted in Denmark for the funeral of King Frederik III in 1670.\n\nRoyalty and heads of state from most of Europe are expected to attend the queen mother's funeral, which will take place at the Roskilde Domkirke cathedral 25km west of Copenhagen on Tuesday. More than 100 000 citizens also are expected to attend the ceremony.\n\nOn Sunday, Ingrid's daughter Princess Benedikte, ex-king Constantine of Greece and several of the younger members of the Danish royal family visited the chapel to lay wreaths at the foot of the coffin.\n\nThe queen mother's other two daughters, reigning Queen Margrethe II and ex-queen of Greece Anne-Marie, along with French-born Prince Consort Henrik, Crown Prince Frederik and his younger brother, Prince Joachim and his wife, Hong Kong-born Princess Alexandra, earlier had also laid wreaths and placed flowers in a private ceremony.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ingrid's coffin will be borne in a horse-drawn hearse in a procession through the streets of the capital to the central train station, where it will be place on board a special train pulled by two veteran stream locomotives to Roskilde.\n\nIngrid's husband King Frederik IX, who died in 1972, was also transported by train to Roskilde for a state funeral and burial in Roskilde.\n\nThe Danish royal family and around 80 of their guests will be seated in three restored first-class coaches dating from the 1930s, while the rest of the funeral guests will be driven in cars and busses.\n\nIngrid, daughter of the late Swedish King Gustaf VI Adolf, married the then Crown Prince Frederik in 1935, and came to Denmark the same year. She is credited with modernising the Danish monarchy, making it the overwhelmingly popular institution it is in the country today. - Sapa-DPA"
