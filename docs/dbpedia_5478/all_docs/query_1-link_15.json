        "text": "Solna (Swedish: Solna kommun or Solna stad, IPA: [ˈsôːlna]) is a primary settlement (or village) and a municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden, located just north of Stockholm City Centre. Its seat is located in the town of Solna, which is a part of the Stockholm urban area. Solna is one of the richest municipalities in Sweden.\n\nThe municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm. None of the area is considered rural, which is unusual for Swedish municipalities, which normally are of mixed rural/urban character. Solna is the third smallest municipality in Sweden in terms of area, after nearby Sundbyberg, as well as Burlöv, Scania County.\n\nSolna borders Stockholm Municipality to the south, southeast and northwest; to Sundbyberg Municipality to the west; to Sollentuna Municipality to the north; and to Danderyd Municipality to the northeast. The boundary with Danderyd Municipality is delineated by the Stocksundet strait.\n\nThere are two parishes in Solna Municipality: Råsunda (population 29,677) and Solna (population 28,317).[3] Solna Parish once included parts of present-day City of Stockholm.[4]\n\nSolna is divided into eight traditional parts with no administrative functions: Bergshamra, Haga, Hagalund, Huvudsta, Järva, Råsunda, Skytteholm and Ulriksdal. The largest districts are Råsunda, Hagalund and Huvudsta, with the Solna Centrum in between them.\n\nWith few exceptions, Solna's built-up areas have a suburban character, but there are also several large parks and Strawberry Arena, Sweden's new national football stadium adjacent to the Solna station of Stockholm commuter rail.\n\nThe final matches of both the 1958 FIFA (men's) World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup were played at Råsunda Stadium, the national football stadium from 1937 to 2012 (demolished in 2013)."
