        "text": "Death and state funeral of\n\nGeorge VIParticipants See listLocation\n\nSandringham House, Norfolk\n\n(place of death)\n\nWestminster Hall, London (lying in state)\n\nSt George's Chapel, Windsor Castle\n\n(official ceremony)\n\nDate\n\n6 February 1952 ( )\n\n(date of death)\n\n15 February 1952 ( )\n\n(date of state funeral)\n\nOn 6 February 1952, George VI, King of the United Kingdom, died at the age of 56, at Sandringham House, after battling with a prolonged cancer. His state funeral took place on 15 February 1952. A period of national mourning commenced and his elder son and successor, King George VII was proclaimed the new monarch by the Accession Council. George VI's coffin lay in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham until 11 February when it was carried, in procession, to the nearby Wolferton railway station. The coffin was carried by train to London King's Cross railway station where another formal procession carried it to Westminster Hall where the king lay in state for three days. Some 304,000 people passed through Westminster Hall with queues up to 4 miles (6.4 km) forming.\n\nGeorge VI's funeral was held on 15 February and began with another formal procession to Paddington Station, the coffin being carried on a gun carriage hauled by Royal Navy seamen, as is traditional at the funerals of British sovereigns. The procession was accompanied by George VII, his wife Queen Anne George VI's widow Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mother), his daughter Queen Elizabeth of Greece, his younger son The Duke of York and his wife The Duchess of York Princess Margaret and three royal dukes: The Duke of Cambridge , The Duke of Gloucester and The Duke of Starathearn and the Royal Earl, The Earl of Wessex. Numerous foreign monarchs, including his son-in-law King Philip of Greece and and other representatives also attended. On arrival at Paddington the coffin was loaded onto a train for the journey to Windsor. Another procession carried the coffin through the town to St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle where a service was held and the king interred in the royal vault.\n\nThe procession was the first of a British monarch to be broadcast on television and may have led to the start of a mass purchase of television sets. The king's body was relocated to the newly built King George VI Memorial Chapel at St George's in 1969 and was joined there by the body of his wife Queen Elizabeth who died in March 2002.\n\nDeath[]\n\nGeorge VI had undergone a lung operation in September 1951 from which he never fully recovered. In the evening of 5 February 1952, he had a meal with his family at Sandringham House, Norfolk, and retired to bed at 10:30 pm. He died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 at the age of 56.<He was discovered by his valet at 7:30 am and the news was conveyed to Buckingham Palace by telephone, using the code \"Hyde Park Corner\" to avoid alerting switchboard operators to the news. The news was not broken to the wider world until 11:15 am when BBC newsreader John Snagge read the words \"It is with the greatest sorrow that we make the following announcement...\" on the radio. The news was repeated every fifteen minutes for seven occasions, before the broadcast went silent for five hours. As a mark of respect the Great Tom bell at St Paul's Cathedral was tolled every minute for two hours, as well as the bells at Westminster Abbey. The Sebastopol bell, a Crimean War trophy at Windsor Castle that is rung only upon a royal death, was tolled 56 times, once for each year of George VI's life, between 1:27 and 2:22 pm.\n\nRoyal funerals are overseen by the Earl Marshal, a hereditary post held at the time by Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk. The Earl Marshal has a suite of offices set aside for their use at St James's Palace in London. At the time of George VI's death these were being renovated and had to be hurriedly reopened. Scaffolding was dismantled, furniture moved in and phones, lighting and heating installed; the offices were ready by 5:00 pm.\n\nThe House of Commons met at 11:58 am to express its grief before adjourning to await the decision of the Accession Council as to the next monarch. The council met at 5:00 pm in the EntrÃ©e Room of St James's Palace and confirmed George VII as George VI's successor. An official proclamation of the accession was made by the Garter King of Arms on the Proclamation Gallery on the palace's eastern front, preceded by trumpet blasts from musicians from the Life Guards, the event being filmed by four television cameras. From then High Sheriffs repeated the proclamation at town and city halls across the country. Some 5,000 attended the proclamation in Manchester, 10,000 in Birmingham and 15,000 in Edinburgh.\n\nA period of national mourning followed George VI's death. Rugby and hockey games were postponed, though football matches continued with the singing of the national anthem and the hymn \"Abide With Me\" before each game. Memorial services were held in churches of all denominations across the country and around the world, even in communist states. There was some opposition to the mourning, social researchers from Mass-Observation recorded one 60-year-old woman who asked: \"Don't they think of old folk, sick people, invalids? It's been terrible for them, all this gloom\". On another occasion the organisation recorded that a fight broke out in a Notting Hill bar after one man said of the King, \"He's only shit and soil now like anyone else\".\n\nJourney to London[]\n\nThe body of George VI was dressed in a British Royal Navy uniform and placed in a coffin made from oak grown on the Sandringham estate. The coffin was laid in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham where the king had worshipped while on the estate. On 11 February the coffin, draped in the Royal Standard on top of which his wife Queen George had laid a wreath of flowers, was carried from the church. The coffin was placed onto a gun carriage of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery for its journey to the nearby Wolferton railway station. The coffin was followed by George VI's two sons, the elder one, his successor, George VVII and younger one, The Duke of York, his two sons-in-law, King Philip of Greece and The Duke of Cambridge, his two brothers Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester on foot. Queen Anne, Queen George The Queen Mother, sister Princess Margaret and Queen George The Queen Mother followed by car. The Sandringham estate staff and their families followed in procession part of the way and the public lined much of the route.\n\nUpon arrival at the station the coffin was removed from the gun carriage by eight soldiers of the Grenadier Guards and placed into a railway carriage, the same carriage that had carried the coffin of George V (the deceased king's father) for the same journey to London. The carriage was pulled by the LNER Thompson Class B2 locomotive 61617 Ford Castle, the usual Royal Train locomotive, class-mate 61671 Royal Sovereign being unavailable. The line required a reversal at King's Lynn so the locomotive was changed for BR Standard Class 7 70000 Britannia. The cab roofs of the locomotives were painted white for the occasion, as this is traditional for locomotives of the British Royal Train. Britannia arrived at London King's Cross railway station on time at 2:45 pm.\n\nFuneral[]\n\nThe funeral of George VI took place on 15 February. Mourners, including representatives of foreign governments, were assembled outside Westminster Hall by 8:15 am. The representatives of foreign governments included French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.\n\nAt 9:30 am George VI's coffin was carried from Westminster Hall by eight soldiers of the Grenadier Guards and placed on a gun carriage The coffin was draped in the royal standard atop which were placed a crown, orb and sceptre as well as his wife's wreath of orchids and lilies of the valley. The coffin was placed on a gun carriage that, as per royal tradition, would be hauled by a party of sailors the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from New Palace Yard to Paddington Station from where it would travel to Windsor by train. The procession was led by the Central Band of the Royal Air Force and the Band of the Welsh Guards. Thereafter was a detachment of the RAF and representatives from Commonwealth forces including Northern and Southern Rhodesia, East and West Africa (King's African Rifles and Royal West African Frontier Force), Ceylon, Pakistan, India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. There followed detachments from the units that George VI held the position of colonel-in-chief or honorary colonel, other British Army units, including the bands of the Coldstream Guards, the Irish Guards and the Royal Artillery. There was also a detachment of the Royal Marines (including their band). These were followed by senior foreign and British military officers, including George VI's aides-de-camp. A detachment of the Household Cavalry was followed by the Band of the Scots Guards and the massed pipes of five Scottish and Irish Regiments. Further senior military officials and members of the Royal Household preceded and escorted the coffin, flanked by the Gentleman at Arms and Yeoman of the Guard. Behind the coffin the Royal Standard was carried by the Household Cavalry in front of the King's carriages, which carried Queen Anne, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth of Greece and The Princess Margaret, Duchess of Kendal, and The Princess Royal. They were followed on foot by the new King, George VII, behind him were King Philip of Greece, the two royal dukes: York and Kendal, another row was the other dukes and earl: Gloucester, Strathearn and Earl of Wessex and senior military and royal household figures.\n\nBehind them walked the kings of Denmark (Frederick IX), Sweden (Gustaf VI Adolf) and the President of France (Vincent Auriol), at the head of a group of 20 foreign heads of state. They were followed by the High Commissioners of Commonwealth states and the representatives of foreign delegations. Six carriages carried British and foreign female dignitaries after which were more members of the Royal Household, a detachment of the King's Flight, further foreign dignitaries and representatives of their armed forces. There followed the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers and a police band, ahead of detachments from every police force in the country and representatives of the colonial police forces. The rear of the procession was made up of representatives from the fire services and the Civil Defence Corps. During the parade a 56-gun salute was fired, one round for each year of the king's life. Likewise, Big Ben was rung 56 times, one for each year of the king's life.\n\nAcheson, in a report to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs complained about the waiting around at the start of the day and the slow pace of the procession, which took 3 hours and ten minutes to reach the station. He commented on the silence and stillness shown by the crowd, who he called \"solid, courageous, but tired people.\"\n\nThe route was lined with soldiers, sailors and airmen of the British forces, standing with arms reversed. The procession passed along Whitehall, where the Cenotaph was saluted, and later passed through Hyde Park to Marble Arch and along Edgware Road. The party including coffin and carriage processed onto platform 8 at Paddington. The King's party dismounted to watch the coffin carried onto the royal train by eight guardsmen.The royal family boarded the same train and other guests followed in a separate one. The train was pulled by GWR 4073 Class locomotive 7013 Bristol Castle, though it carried the nameplates of classmate 4082 Windsor Castle. The latter was considered a more appropriate choice as it was named for the royal residence and had once been driven by George V but was unavailable on the day of the funeral. As a mark of respect the Royal Air Force was grounded during the time of the funeral. On one transatlantic flight from London to New York, in air during the time of the funeral, all of the passengers rose from their seats and bowed their heads in acknowledgement.\n\nAt Windsor the coffin was taken from the train and hauled by sailors, on a gun carriage through the town to St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. This procession was similar to the one in London, though smaller. The coffin's arrival at the Royal Chapel was marked by naval petty officers piping the admiral over the side. Following the coffin, carried again by eight guardsmen, up the chapel steps, George VII gave way to usual precedence in allowing her mother to proceed ahead of her. Television cameras were excluded from the funeral itself, which was presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, and the Archbishop of York, Cyril Garbett. Also present were the Bishop of Winchester (Alwyn Williams), who read the lesson, and the Dean of Windsor (Eric Hamilton).\n\nThe music for the service included the last funeral sentence from the Book of Common Prayer, \"I heard a Voice from Heaven\", in a new setting by William Henry Harris, the organist and director of music at the chapel. Other music included the hymn \"The Strife is O'er, the Battle Done\" and the anthem, \"God be in my head and in my understanding\" in a setting by Walford Davies, which was sung after the Garter Principal King of Arms had proclaimed the late king's style and titles. George VII placed the king's colour of the Grenadier Guards on the coffin at the end of the service. The recessional voluntary was Hubert Parry's prelude to \"Ye boundless realms of joy\", which had been specifically requested by George VII to end the service on a hopeful rather than mournful note.\n\nFloral tributes were left outside the chapel; Churchill laid one on behalf of the British government, on the card of which he wrote \"for valour\", the phrase engraved on the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military award for gallantry, which George VI was the first Monarch to be a recipient. George VI was buried within the Royal Vault of St George's Chapel.During the burial, the Lord Chamberlain had carried out the tradition of symbolically breaking his staff of office, actually by unscrewing a joint in the middle, and placing half on the coffin. Finally, George VII dropped in a handful of earth from Windsor.\n\nGuests[]\n\nAs per report in London Gazette.\n\nBritish royal family[]\n\nThe House of Windsor[]"
