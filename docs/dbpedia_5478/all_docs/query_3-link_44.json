        "text": "The funeral of His Majesty King Michael of Romania was held on Saturday 16 December 2017 in Bucharest, eleven days after the deposed monarch died in Switzerland at the age of 96.\n\nThe ceremonies began with the arrival of King Michael's coffin at Bucharest's Henri Coanada Airport, aboard a special flight of the Romanian Air Force. His body was transported to Peles Castle in the Carpathian Mountains. This was the summer home of the Romanian royal family and a part of the royal estate where Michael was born in 1921. His body lay in state here privately, where members of his family, members of the Romanian government, and other designated diplomats were permitted to come and pay their respects. The following day, the funeral cortege went to Bucharest, where it was to lie in state at the former Royal Palace, which today is the National Museum of Art. During this time, the general public was granted access to file past the coffin and pay their respects to the deceased monarch.\n\nThe funeral began on Saturday, 16 December with a religious ceremony in the Royal Palace, followed by an outdoor religious and military ceremony in the square outside of the Royal Palace, where King Michael's coffin was placed atop a catafalque. Members of foreign royal families joined Romanian politicians and the Romanian royal family for the services.\n\nAs King Michael's coffin was lifted from the catafalque and placed on a gun carriage by Romanian soldiers, applause broke out among the spectators, and as the gun carriage paraded through the streets of Bucharest to the Patriarchal Cathedral, thousands of people applauded and chanted \"Regele Mihai\" (King Michael).\n\nAfterward, the coffin was then transported by train to the town of Curtea de Arges, where members of the royal house have been buried in the city's cathedral. A burial service was held at the cathedral that evening, and His Majesty King Michael was laid to rest beside his wife, Queen Anne, who died in September 2016.\n\nThe royal guests in attendance at the King's funeral included his immediate family and his relatives from many of Europe's royal houses. For the first time in years, all five of King Michael's daughters were reunited - Crown Princess Margareta, with her husband, Prince Radu; Princess Helen, with her husband, Alexander Nixon; Mrs. Irina Walker, formerly Princess Irina (she was deprived of her royal title following her 2014 conviction for operating an illegal cockfighting ring near her home in Oregon, USA); Princess Sophie, and Princess Maria. Two of King Michael's five grandchildren were in attendance - Nicholas Medforth-Mills (formerly Prince Nicholas of Romania) and his sister, Elisabeta-Karina Medforth-Mills, who are both the children of Michael's second daughter, Princess Helen. Nicholas was accompanied by his fiance, Alina Binder. It was a noteworthy appearance for Nicholas, as he had landed himself in the news recently due to a supposed quarrel with members of King Michael's household who blocked him from visiting his dying grandfather back in October after it was announced that the king's health had deteriorated. Two of King Michael's American-born grandchildren, Irina Walker's children Michael Kreuger and Angelica Knight - sent wreaths in memory of their grandfather, which were displayed on the gates outside of the Royal Palace.\n\nThe British royal family was represented by HRH The Prince of Wales (Charles's father, Prince Philip, was a childhood playmate of King Michael as well as his first cousin once removed; Michael's mother, Helen, was Philip's first cousin). Belgium was represented by Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este (Prince Lorenz is a member of the so-called \"Crown Council\" for the Romanian royal house). Princess Muna, the mother of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who has a close friendship with the Romania royals, was in attendance. HM Queen Anne-Marie of Greece represented her husband, King Constantine II, who is Michael's first cousin. The Greek royal party also consisted of Anne-Marie's son, Prince Nikolaos, and King Constantine's younger sister, Princess Irene. A former Greek princess, Queen Sofia of Spain, who is also Michael's first cousin, attended along with her husband, King Juan Carlos. The King and Queen of Sweden and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg were the reigning monarchs in attendance, along with the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Yugoslavia, the Crown Prince of Albania, and the heads of the deposed House of Romanov and House of Hohenzollern. During the funeral procession, Prince Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, walked alongside the Romanian royal family, ostensibly as the head of the House of Hohenzollern, from which the Romanian royal family descends.\n\nThe Beauharnais family – unexpected royal conquerors\n\nJoséphine de Beauharnais with her children, Eugène and Hortense. When Emperor Napoleon dissolved his marriage with Joséphine de Beauharnais over her inability to sire an heir for his newly minted imperial throne, it was sufficient to say that her legacy would probably be a tarnished one. Though her beauty had been renowned and her charm was indisputable, she had been put aside by the most powerful man in all of Europe. She perhaps went to her grave four years later believing she had failed in her duty. Ironically, the lineage that Joséphine had felt such pressure to continue would die out prematurely, while her own descendants from her previous marriage made surprisingly advantageous marital alliances with various royal houses of Europe. As it stands today, Napoleon has no surviving legitimate descendants, while Joséphine’s descendants currently occupy the thrones of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Furthermore, two of her grandchildren were consorts to past mo\n\n70th Birthday of HM Queen Anne-Marie of Greece\n\nHer Majesty Queen Anne-Marie of Greece turns seventy on August 30, 2016. The wife of former King Constantine II of Greece, she has led a remarkable life, from her beginnings as a princess of Europe's oldest monarchy to becoming the young queen of a politically unstable kingdom before facing nearly fifty years of exile. Despite such misfortunes, the Queen has drawn comfort from a loving marriage, a happy family life with five children and, later on, nine grandchildren, and the privilege of retaining close family ties to the other reigning houses of Europe. She was born as Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark on August 30, 1946 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, the third and youngest daughter of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid. Her father was the son of King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. Through her mother, Anne-Marie is a great-great-granddaughter of \"the grandmother of Europe\", Queen Victoria of Great Britain, an\n\nGolden Wedding Anniversary of King Constantine & Queen Anne-Marie\n\nOn September 18, Their Majesties King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece celebrate their fiftieth year of marriage. It has been a long and successful marriage for the couple, who endured the turmoil of Greek politics in the 1960s and spent over four decades in exile. Despite the challenges they faced, they have a large and happy family, and for the last decade or so have enjoyed a peaceful life with the company of their children and grandchildren. King Constantine II of Greece was 24 and Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark had just turned 18 when they wed fifty years ago, at a time when it was still relatively common for royals to intermarry with other royals. Constantine II had ascended the Greek throne only six months before when his father unexpectedly died, and Anne-Marie, the youngest daughter of King Frederick IX of Denmark, had just completed her schooling. Their wedding saw the largest gathering of royalty Athens had ever witnessed, and the photogenic couple's pictur"
