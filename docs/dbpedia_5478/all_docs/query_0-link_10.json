        "text": "Silvia Renate Sommerlath was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 23 December 1943. Her father, Walther Sommerlath was a German-born company director; while her mother Alice Soares de Toledo hailed from Brazil. Alice’s father Artur Floriano de Toledo was a direct descendant of King Afonso III of Portugal, who lived and reigned in the 13th century. Walther first met his wife-to-be during a pre-war visit to Rio de Janeiro. Silvia had three brothers, Ralf, Walther and Jörg. The family lived in Heidelberg until 1947 when they relocated to São Paulo, Brazil, where Walther had been appointed Managing Director of the Brazilian offshoot of the Swedish company, Uddeholm AB. They were to remain there for a decade, meaning that in addition to German, Silvia was equally fluent in speaking Portuguese. She attended Visconde de Porto Seguro School and spent holidays at her maternal uncle’s farm in the country along with members of her extended family. There were many cousins as Alice Soares de Toledo came from a large family. She had eight siblings-all brothers.\n\nIn 1957, the Sommerlath’s returned to live in Germany in the city of Düsseldorf. The reason for this relocation was that Silvia’s father had been asked to take charge of Uddeholm’s German operations. Silvia subsequently attended the Luisenschule there before enrolling, in 1965, at the Sprachen-und-Dolmetscher-Institut in Munich, to train as an interpreter, specialising in Spanish. On graduating, she was employed at the Argentine Consulate in Munich.\n\nHowever, she was soon destined for higher responsibilities and oversaw the training of Official Hostesses for the Olympic Games which took place in Munich in 1972 from August until September. During the event itself she acted as Chief Hostess and interacted with many of the VIP’s who attended. It was during these games that she met Crown Prince Carl Gustaf of Sweden in the VIP room. It was, she recalled, a ‘particularly amusing’ encounter as Carl Gustaf was observing her through binoculars, even though she was standing only one metre away from him! Something must have clicked for the Crown Prince invited her to attend a private family dinner attended by himself, his uncle Prince Bertil, the latter’s future wife Lilian Craig, the Crown Prince’s older sister Princess Birgitta and her husband Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. The dinner seemed to go without a hitch and soon Carl Gustaf and Silvia were dancing the night away at a local night club, Kinki. The couple were to keep in touch by phone, just as Carl Gustav was about to face many major changes in his life.\n\nIn November of that year, the Crown Prince lost his beloved mother, Sibylla, to cancer, only weeks after she had attended the 90th birthday celebrations of her father-in-law, King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. Born a Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Sibylla had been ‘first lady’ of Sweden since the death of the King’s second wife, Queen Louise in 1965. Sweden was now without a matriarchal royal figure. Then, in September 1973, King Gustaf VI Adolf died and his grandson now succeeded him as King of Sweden, taking the title of Carl XVI Gustaf. The royal title had skipped a generation as the new king’s father, Hereditary Prince Gustaf Adolf had been killed in an air accident in 1947 at Copenhagen’s Kastrup Airport en route home from a hunting expedition.\n\nBy this stage, Carl Gustaf and Silvia had been meeting up in Sweden (where she was photographed with Carl Gustaf as he drove his Porsche sports car through the countryside on the island of Öland) and also in Germany. Sometimes, Silvia resorted to wearing a wig as a disguise but very few were fooled as to her identity, as she would later admit. In due course, the couple went skiing in the Alps or sailing with friends in Sardinia. Meanwhile, Silvia had been appointed deputy chief of protocol on the organising committee of the 1976 Winter Olympics which took place in Innsbruck in February of that year. It was a frenetic period with great responsibilities. Ironically, the skills she learned both now and earlier in Munich would stand her in good stead in the future. It helped that she spoke German, Portuguese, Spanish, English and French.\n\nWithin weeks of completing her duties in Innsbruck, Silvia travelled to Sweden where the couple announced their engagement on March 12, 1976, in the sitting room of what had been the late Princess Sibylla’s apartments in the Royal Palace. The news was widely covered on the world stage and suddenly everyone was interested in the young Swedish king and his beautiful bride-to-be, who had already learned to speak some Swedish. The Swedes seemed keen to embrace their future queen and cheered the pair as they left the Royal Palace, following the press conference, to lunch with Princess Christina and her husband at their Villa Beylon home in the romantic parklands surrounding Ulriksdal Palace.\n\nThe King married Silvia in Stockholm’s Storkyrkan before 1200 guests on 19 June 1976. Crowds, estimated at around 200,000 lined the streets of the capital city. Silvia’s wedding dress was beautifully designed by Marc Bohan of the Paris fashion house Dior using white silk with a train of just over 3.5 metres. As if it to emphasise her new role as Queen of Sweden, Silvia wore the historical Kamédiadem, a diadem formed of cameos, gold, pearls and brilliants which was originally a gift from Emperor Napoleon I of France to his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais. The diadem, along with the matching parure of necklace, earrings and bracelets, was subsequently inherited by Empress Joséphine’s granddaughter, Joséphine of Leuchtenberg who was Consort to King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway. The suite of jewels was then passed down through the family to Prince Eugen, the youngest, bachelor son of King Oscar II, who gave the historical jewellery to Princess Sibylla as a wedding gift in 1932. The diadem was subsequently worn by Sibylla’s daughters Princess Birgitta and Princess Désirée at the time of their marriages.\n\nAt the time of Silvia and Carl Gustaf’s marriage, a royal charitable foundation was established, known as the King and Queen’s Wedding Fund. The fund, which supports the development of projects and activities, whether they be related to sport or culture or athletics, for the benefit of children and young people with disabilities through the award of grants (around 25 each year) to recognised bodies such as sports clubs or disability associations. This was an early indication of the charitable work the Queen would undertake with children and youths in the not too distant future. Indeed, today she has links with around 80 organisations in various sectors, some of which will be discussed in the course of this article.\n\nThe couple’s first child, Victoria, was born at Karolinska University Hospital on 14 July 1977. Carl Philip followed in May of 1979. For a brief period he was Crown Prince of Sweden. However, in a somewhat controversial move, the rules of succession of the Crown were changed from 1 January 1980, with the eldest child of the Sovereign becoming heir to the throne regardless of gender (where previously only males could inherit). This applied retrospectively, meaning Victoria was now Crown Princess. The royal couples youngest child, Madeleine, was born on 10 June 1982. The previous year the King and Queen and their children had moved out of the Royal Palace in central Stockholm and moved to a twenty-room apartment in the south wing of Drottningholm Palace in the suburbs. In the summer, Silvia and her family would move southwards to Solliden Palace, the King’s privately-owned residence on the island of Öland. Here Silvia still loves to garden, introducing new plants and enjoying the vistas of the extensive parklands. She has enthused too that ‘the air is so soft here.’\n\nThe Queen had by now established her Swedish credentials. She spoke the difficult language fluently and was present at National Day celebrations throughout Sweden, accompanied by her husband and children, wearing the traditional Sverigedräkten outfit. Silvia also proved a sparkling presence at the annual Nobel awards ceremony each December, for she had one of the largest collections of royal jewellery in the world at her disposal and this was an ideal occasion at which to showcase these items. A particular favourite is the Leuchtenberg sapphire suite which features a magnificent tiara set with diamonds and nine stunning sapphires. This is complimented by a sapphire and diamond necklace and earrings.\n\nYet, entering public life was not necessarily easy for the Queen. She is actually quite a shy person and during interviews she comes across as quietly spoken but concise. Princess Christina, the King’s sister, has recently admitted that ‘The Queen had no idea what she was getting herself into. And my brother wasn’t very helpful’. Neither, initially, were some of his friends nor members of his small staff from his bachelor days, who included a stern Finnish cook. It has also to be remembered that Silvia at that time had no friends or contacts out with the immediate royal family. Elisabeth Olsson, the Queen’s Lady-in-Waiting during those early years proved particularly helpful where matters of procedure and protocol were concerned. Another of the biggest challenges to be faced was the tremendous amount of planning that was required behind the scenes in relation to Queen’s forthcoming engagements. Like all newlyweds, the couple soon discovered their foibles: the King was punctual while the Queen was much more relaxed about timekeeping. This could put Carl Gustaf in a bad mood. However, the tension would soon dissipate.\n\nOn 23 December 1993 the Queen celebrated her 50th birthday. She received a most welcome gift from the people of Sweden: The Queen Silvia Jubilee Fund which provides assistance to children with disabilities. The Queen, as Chairperson, still takes a keen interest in the charity’s work.\n\nIn 1994, Silvia was involved in founding the what was then the Mentor Foundation and is today known as Mentor International, with operations in Sweden, Latvia, the United States and Arabia. This organisation provides mentors to children both to guide them in life decisions and to improve their self-esteem. A focus too is on a drug-free life environment.\n\nSilvia established the World Childhood Foundation in 1999, the aim of which is to improve conditions for vulnerable children who are exposed to violence or sexual attacks. Over the years, the Foundation has supported more than 1,200 projects in 19 different countries. The Queen is currently the Honorary Chairperson of the Foundation.\n\nThe Queen was rightly gaining a reputation, both at home and internationally, for being hardworking and committed to her charitable causes. She was regarded by many peers as a major player in relation to children’s rights issues. However, Silvia was about to expand her interests in yet another direction: The growing cases of dementia also became of concern to the Queen who today feels strongly that ‘it is our duty to know how to deal with dementia.’ She initially realised that many did not recognise it as a disease. Silvia had first hand experience of the problem as her mother (who lived with her for a period in Stockholm in the 1990’s) was a sufferer. The Queen was fortunate in that she had the help of two nurses who had previous experience with the elderly, but that was exceptional. The charity, Stiftelsen Silviahemmet, came into being on Valentine’s Day, 1996 and firstly focused on establishing a school to teach nurses and care assistants about the rudiments of dementia care. Later this awareness was expanded to include doctors, dentists, taxi drivers and professional in the financial sector. Certification programmes were then established. Apartments were also acquired which had special adaptations to make life easier for those caring for a someone with dementia. Then, in 2012, the Queen Silvia Nursing Award was established to foster positive change, growth, innovation and excellence in the field of nursing, especially geriatric nursing. The award (a scholarship) is available to both practicing nurses and nursing students in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and the United States. In recognition of Her Majesty’s dedication to the elderly and dementia care, the Queen was named an Honorary Ambassador of Alzheimer’s Disease International in December 2018.\n\nBut this deep interest in Alzheimer’s did not preclude Queen Silvia expanding her concern for matters relating to children and youths. In 2009, the Queen initiated the World Child & Youth Forum, now known as the Global Child Forum which works with business organisations to raise awareness of children’s rights, and develop effective tools to integrate these perspectives into their everyday operations. Then, in 2013, the Queen celebrated her 70th birthday with the establishment of Queen Silvia’s Foundation – Care About the Children. This provides support to at risk children both in Sweden and overseas through partnerships forged with established aid agencies.\n\nSilvia’s commitment to child welfare now led to her receiving several international awards, including the Martin Buber Prize in 2014. What Queen Silvia would have made of once being ranked 68th in Forbes’ Magazines ranking of the world’s 100 most powerful women must remain open to speculation, but it would not surprise if she was quietly bemused, not to say slightly amused. It seems fitting, however, that Sweden’s largest children’s hospital, Queen Silvia’s Children’s Hospital in Gothenburg, is named after her.\n\nOn her 75th birthday, the Queen gave an interview at the Royal Palace in Stockholm to Dirceu Martins of Brazil’s EPTV, for their television series “Our People”. Speaking in faultless Brazilian Portuguese, Silvia spoke of the ‘pleasant joy’ of her childhood and her enduring and very strong connection with Brazil, emphasising that ‘Brazil is part of my life’. She joked, ‘I think I’m the only one who has a jaboticaba tree outside of Brazil that bears fruit’. The tree is carefully kept under glass in a greenhouse in winter but brought out in the warmer months. The Queen also indicated that she still had relations (cousins and second cousins) in São João da Boa Vista, in the municipality of São Paulo, and that ‘I try to come back every year’. But the interview was not just full of pleasantries. Mention was made of Childhood Brazil, a charity the Queen set up in 1999 after visiting a favela where she met a child who literally lived in a box. Silvia was haunted by his situation and decided to act. Today the charity works against the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents, many of whom have been described in the past as “street children”. It was a controversial move at that time, for as Her Majesty acknowledged, ‘no one wanted to talk about it.’ The Queen however remained determined to draw attention to the matter even though the discussions shocked many. Today, the charity is heavily involved with establishing protection procedures and networks. She also spoke of her cultural roots, ‘I have a Brazilian heart, a mind perhaps which is more German, but the whole thing is now Swedish. I bring together all three of these nationalities and cultures.’ She feels that ‘this helps me a lot now also here in Sweden, we now have many who arrive from other countries and this respect for other cultures is always alive, it helps me a lot.’\n\nLeading such a busy public life, Silvia has to look her best. Peter Hägelstam has been the Queen’s hairdresser of choice almost since her arrival in Sweden. His business partner Johan Hellström has also been known to attend to Silvia’s locks. As to dressing for official occasions, the Queen has a very definite view of what suits her. For day wear two-piece suits are a favourite, although she is also sometimes seen wearing a blazer with trousers (or “pants” as they are referred to in North America). While the Queen may run to Chanel for special occasions, she has often been seen in clothes from high street outlets such as Zara or H & M. She is also keen on sustainability and on one occasion (at a Bea Szenfeld exhibition in Germany) she was photographed in a white suit which was forty years old. For evening wear, she is a devotee of the German fashion brand Georg et Arend, which is overseen by two brothers. During the recent celebrations held over three days in September and attended by Scandinavian Heads of State to celebrate the King’s fifty years on the throne, Queen Silvia wore several Georg et Arend evening gowns, one in a light pink colour, decorated with pearls and rhinestones and another in a striking yellowish-gold.\n\nBut having focused on the public side of Silvia’s life, it is also expedient to look at her private life. Where her children concerned, the Queen gave much time and thought on how to raise them, given their unusual situation as royal family members. She admits that ‘it is essential to show them what it all means, to teach them how to evolve in these special circumstances. They need to be helped to distinguish between what is “public” and what is “private”.’ This was particularly true of the heir, Crown Princess Victoria ‘who was always special, even when she was little. She was very observant as a child. She always looked at others with sympathy but also with great curiosity.’\n\nThe Queen has been fortunate to make some friends who can be relied upon for their loyalty and discretion. Four names in particular were mentioned in an article by Anna Clara von Hofsten of Svensk Damtidning in 2020. They are Catharina Stenbock Lewenhaupt, Elisabeth Fernström, Agneta Kreuger and Agneta Banér, who have been described as Silvia’s ‘inner circle’. These friends also rely on each other and each can also count on the Queen to be a caring, sympathetic ear should they have any issues or problems in their own lives. Furthermore, even with her busy schedule, Silvia never forgets her friends’ birthdays. Another friend, Marianne Bergengren, who lives in Klosters, notes that when Silvia pays her a visit in Switzerland, she is happy to make her own bed and load the dishwasher. A particularly close friend of the Queen was the late Agneta Génetay, who was married to a good friend of the King, Tim Génetay. This couple helped to ease Silvia’s path into Swedish society. The Queen is godmother to their daughter Josephine. The latter is also a friend of Crown Princess Victoria.\n\nBut of course, above all the Queen is closest to her growing family. In February 2012, Silvia’s first grandchild, a girl named Estelle, was born at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. As the eldest child of Crown Princess Victoria, she is second-in-line to succeed to the throne of Sweden. Today, Silvia has eight grandchildren, ranging in age from two to eleven. Currently, the three children of Princess Madeleine and her financier husband Christopher O’Neill live in the United States, although they visit Sweden frequently and it is hoped they will the family will settle in Stockholm in the near future. In the summer the O’ Neill family often inhabit the Cavalier House, on the Solliden estate, as do Prince Carl Philip and his family. This property was originally used to house retainers and royal servants. Meanwhile, Crown Princess Victoria and her family also have their own “summer cottage” nearby, the ultra-modern Villa Skönvik near the Kalmar Strait which was built in 2013.\n\nThe Queen has also been kind over the years to many members of her extended family. When Prince Bertil was nearing the end of his life, she would sleep overnight on a makeshift bed at his home, the Villa Solbacken, so she could be of assistance to his wife Princess Lilian. The latter was full of admiration for Silvia and would recall how each morning the Queen would rise (probably after a disturbed night of sleep) and depart for her office at the Royal Palace and a full day of engagements. When Princess Lilian herself became frail and forgetful, the Queen was a constant and comforting presence. The King and Queen and their children were at her bedside when she died in March 2013 at her Djurgården villa at the age of 97. Furthermore, Silvia’s aged brother Walther Sommerlath came to live in Stockholm, staying with his wife Ingrid at Nedre Sjöflygeln, a house in the park at Drottningholm, once used by Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Daniel. He died, aged 86, in October 2020 after a period of illness. The Queen issued a statement stating, ‘I and my family feel great sorrow and loss for my brother Walther’. She also asked for privacy for his family. Her brother Jörg had already passed away in 2006. Meanwhile, Walther’s son, Patrick Sommerlath has lived in Sweden since 1987 and has always been part of the extended royal family. He came to live in Stockholm following the break-up of his parent’s marriage.\n\nThe royal children adore their mother. Princess Madeleine finds that ‘She’s so caring. She cares!’ while her son Carl Philip observes that ‘She’s brave and not afraid to ask the uncomfortable questions, but she does ask them in an elegant way.’ This comment has echoes of a remark made by the Queen’s late father concerning her ‘delightful behaviour’ in her dealings with people and situations.\n\nWhen not working, the King and Queen will often walk his dog Brandie. Silvia is a keen swimmer too when she has the chance and in that respect, the Villa Mirage at St Maxime on the French Riviera (formerly owned by Prince Bertil and his wife Princess Lilian) must have seemed a welcome godsend for the house affords privacy and is set on a small private beach. Skiing too is a favourite pastime whether it be downhill or cross-country. For the latter Silvia only has to venture out to the parklands surrounding Drottningholm Palace, but for more adventurous skiing holidays she and the King venture to their lodge in the well-known ski resort of Storlien, near the Norwegian border, or they might even go abroad to Alpine resorts such as Klosters in Switzerland. Silvia also enjoys more leisurely pastimes, such as reading, visits to the opera, the theatre or to concerts (including the summer concerts held in the park at Solliden).\n\nLike everyone, the King and Queen had to adapt their lives to cope with the Covid pandemic. Meetings, audiences and conference calls were held on-line, as opposed to in person. Initially, a good deal of their time was spent at Stenhammar Palace near Flen, where they were joined for a period by Princess Birgitta, the King’s older sister. This mansion house (it is not particularly large) with farmland attached, has been used by Carl Gustaf since the 1960’s. The King and Queen often spend weekends here, which suits Silvia who loves walking and horse riding. Otherwise, the summer dining-room at Drottningholm was also used for on-line meetings.\n\nAs the Queen’s 80th birthday is reached, she has been keen to emphasise-through a court spokesperson, Margareta Thorgren, that she is does not dwell on her age; rather Silvia is focused on the future and what she wishes to achieve. Those who know and work with the Queen on a regular basis also observe that she is never short of ideas. Journalist and former court employee Barbro Hultman has said that ‘She places great demands on those around her, but even more on herself. Everything has to be perfect.’ Work is certainly her priority as she arrives most weekday mornings at her three-room office suite close-by the East Gate of the Royal Palace. Should it happen to be Tuesday, then the Queen will be faced with yet another of those interminable planning meetings to coordinate forthcoming engagements and to decide what she can or cannot fit in. Silvia’s own low-ceilinged office is reasonably large and is dominated by a large tiled stove. In one corner, there is a large antique desk at which the Queen works. There are also two separate seating areas for visitors, featuring gilded antique chairs set around tables. By contrast, Her Majesty prefers to make use of a workaday, modern office chair. Silvia clearly has a sense of humour for on display is a rectangular cushion on which are stitched the words “It Ain’t Easy Being Queen!” One downside, say observers, is that Silvia might continue to work too hard on her various projects when perhaps she should take a break!\n\nIt is fair to say that the focus this year has been very much on the King’s Golden Jubilee with numerous events held throughout Sweden to help commemorate Carl VI Gustaf’s fifty years on the throne-the longest of any king of Sweden in history. This has meant the King and Queen undertaking extensive “county” tours the length and breadth of the Kingdom, in addition to the normal work schedule which included a State Visit to Sweden in late October from French President Macron and his wife Birgitte, together with a State Visit in May by the King and Queen to Estonia. There was also the death, in early November, of a close and trusted friend of the King and Queen, 100-year-old Count Hans-Gabriel Trolle-Wachtmeister, whose late wife, Alice, was Mistress of the Court. Silvia was seen to be visibly upset and wiping away tears at his funeral. It is no wonder that commentators noted that the Queen appeared somewhat drawn at the recent Nobel festivities.\n\nBy contrast, on the 23 December, Silvia will celebrate her milestone birthday with a private dinner, attended by family and friends, at her home at Drottningholm Palace. There had earlier been a concert in her honour (on 30 November) organised by the Lilla Akademien (Music School for Youth) of which Silvia is Royal Patron. This event-which featured singing and musical renditions by pupils of the school-was also attended by representatives of her other charitable foundations. Present too were the King, Prince Carl Philip, Princess Madeleine (who had flown over from the United States), Princess Christina, her husband Tord Magnuson and Princess Benedikte of Denmark, representing the Danish Royal Family. The Queen (who was dressed in a two-piece light pistachio silk suit with sequin panels) and her royal party enjoyed a wide range of music including renditions of Bach’s Ave Maria and Abba’s Dancing Queen. According to Mr Magnuson ‘Silvia was super happy with the evening. It was only positive, so much fun.’ Another event was the Queen’s presence with her eight grandchildren, on 18 December, in the courtyard of the Royal Palace to receive Christmas spruce trees from the forestry students from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences at Umeå (who were dressed in Christmas attire). Silvia last did the honours some sixteen years ago.\n\nAs for birthday gifts, Her Majesty’s only wish is that people will show concern for the children of Ukraine by donating money to the Collection Box of the Children of the World campaign to improve their living conditions. Silvia has been keen to promote their plight and was filmed with a group in Stockholm, participating with gusto in the group actions to a well-known song.\n\nFor all her achievements the Queen remains remarkably self-effacing. She does not like to be described as powerful or having power. This is a sensitive area as the family must be politically neutral and power is very much associated with politics at this level. The most Silvia would be prepared-at a push-to acknowledge is that she has some influence and the ability to move matters forward on occasion using the ‘diplomatic ability’ her late father spoke of at the time of her marriage in 1976. In reality, she has become a formidable operator, with nearly fifty years of ‘regal’ experience behind her. Silvia’s friend, Catharina Stenbock Lewenhaupt has said ‘She [Silvia] really is the right person in the right place! And with the intelligence, dutifulness, thoughtfulness, and charisma she has, she really is a queen for her time. And a sweet and dear friend…!” Perhaps the last word might go to the Queen’s sister-in-law Princess Christina, who confided to royal biographer Ingrid Thörnqvist that ‘I admire her immensely.’ Sister-in-laws are not always known for kind words, so this is praise indeed.\n\nHappy Birthday Ma’am!\n\nSweden and Norway had been joined together in a union since 1814. From then, they had shared a common monarch, who was the pivotal link in this union of two nations, the last of whom would be King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, who had been crowned as King of Norway in Nidaros Cathedral on 18 July 1873 (and in Stockholm Cathedral as King of Sweden on 12 May 1873) . This Swedish-born King, who spoke fluent Norwegian, was largely based in Stockholm, although he did make regular visits to the Royal Palace in Christiana (now Oslo) as well as to other parts of Norway. The Norwegians had their own parliament (the Storting) and Constitution (formulated back in 1814 and signed in May of that year). Furthermore, matters relating to foreign affairs were dealt with in Stockholm, where the Foreign Minister was based. This was to be a source of increasing discontent in Norway, for the Norwegians were a proud people with a strong sense of national identity and a Norwegian royal line which stretched back to the 9th century and the reign of King Harald I.\n\nIn the 1870’s and early 1880’s the King had repeatedly vetoed constitutional amendments passed by the Storting. Yet, royal visits from Stockholm continued regardless. In 1881 the King established-at the instigation of Christian Holst, who was manager of the Bygdøy royal estate-what was known initially as Oscar II’s Collection, a small group of historic buildings, taken from their original locations around Norway and rebuilt at Bygdøy. This collection was to be the forerunner of what would become known as the Norwegian Folk Museum. Another frequent visitor was Oscar’s eldest son, Crown Prince Gustav of Norway and Sweden. Gustav ventured to Norway in June 1877 during which he included a visit to Tromsø and the following year, he was accompanied on his trip by France’s Prince Imperial (the only son of Napoleon III) during which the royal duo enjoyed a stopover at Osebro.\n\nIn February 1882, a Welcome Arch was erected in Carl Johans Gate in Christiana to commemorate the visit of Crown Prince Gustav and his wife, Victoria of Baden. This was Victoria’s first visit as Crown Princess to Norway, the couple having married only five months previously. Several buildings were handsomely decorated with the letters of G and V and there was a huge torchlight parade as the royal couple made their way, in an open carriage, through the capital’s streets, which were thronged by well wishers, to the Royal Palace. On another occasion the Crown Princely couple ventured to the theatre during which they passed through a royal arch lit by electric bulbs-something of a rarity in those days.\n\nThe Liberal Party, elected in 1884, led by Johan Sverdrup, was focused on establishing a strong parliamentary system (and some would say a diminution of the royal prerogative powers). The government would also become increasingly concerned with strengthening Norway’s position on the international scene, particularly as the country’s overseas trade became vital to energising the economy. It was argued by those in the business and shipping sector that there were now too few consulates to support this increase in foreign trade. Following their re-election in 1891, the increasingly nationalistic Liberal Party government, now led by Johannes Steen, therefore took the view that Norway should have its own autonomous consular service. They made NOK 50,000 available for this purpose. But a rattled King Oscar (who had also got wind of the possible appointment of an autonomous Norwegian Foreign Minister) was intent on vetoing such attempts by the government and this led to a constitutional crisis. This was only (temporarily) resolved by putting aside the matter of the consular service for the present.\n\nThe royal family, who were keen to maintain the union between Norway and Sweden, continued to make their presence felt in Christiana. In October 1893, King Oscar and Crown Prince Gustav made a joint visit during which they opened the Bandak Canal which connects Skien and Dalen in western Telemark. Another attempt, in 1895, in the Storting, to terminate consular cooperation with Sweden and push through a unilateral resolution for the establishment of a Norwegian Consular Service was met by menacing threats and sabre rattling on the part of Sweden (who were militarily superior to Norway). However, despite ongoing political rumblings, events were sufficiently settled to permit King Oscar to travel by train to Christiana in 1897 to mark the 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne of Norway. A service of thanksgiving was held in St Saviour’s Church, while the Stock Exchange, the Military Academy and many other official buildings were festooned with flags, bunting and greenery.\n\nThe Crown Prince also continued to make visits. For instance, in May 1898, he paid a visit to Ullensvang. However, another visit, in the spring of 1899, was to prove more eventful and troublesome as Gustav explained in a letter to his father, King Oscar, from the Royal Palace in Christiana. Most unusually, the Crown Prince had been jeered at by a crowd of around two hundred on his return to the palace from a meeting of the Military Society. Gustav was somewhat shaken by this turn of events, but put it down to ‘half drunk’ students. After the Royal Guard had eventually intervened and arrested a couple of demonstrators, the others soon dispersed.\n\nThe Crown Prince then issued invitations to members of the Storting to dine with him at the Royal Palace. Around 70 members (whom Gustav would later describe to his father, as being of a left-wing persuasion) returned their invites. Nonetheless, the Crown Prince went ahead with the dinner although he decided not to make the customary toast to the Storting (whilst simultaneously declining Mr Viggo Ullman, the President of the Storting’s, request to toast Gustav’s health). Instead, the Crown Prince limited himself to toasting the health of the King. Yet Gustav also made clear his displeasure at this snub by the Norwegian politicians to those members who did attend the event at the Royal Palace. This protest by the Norwegian politicians had also garnered much criticism in Sweden.\n\nIndeed, by October 1900, Crown Prince Gustav was growing increasingly exasperated by events in Norway. Writing to his tennis partner, Pontus Quarnström, he spoke of his longing to leave Christiana and bemoaned the behaviour of Norwegian politicians, three government ministers having recently resigned. Furthermore, Gustav (who had vice-regal authority) felt that the government were not observing the necessary constitutional niceties, by not consulting him about the appointment of new ministers, in particular a Minister of War. A meeting about the matter had proved ‘unpleasant and difficult’ but the Crown Prince seems to have been equal to the task, warning the offenders that if they stepped on his toes, he would most certainly step on theirs. Despite these feelings, the Crown Prince continued to reach out to the Norwegian people and, in 1901, he was present on the balcony of the Royal Palace during Norway’s National Day, 17 May (the first member of the royal family ever to do so, for the Bernadotte’s had customarily avoided being in Norway at this time) to greet flag-waving Norwegians who had gathered before the palace, as had been the tradition for the past thirty years.\n\nHowever, at least a war between Norway and Sweden-the thought of which King Oscar had regarded as ‘abhorrent’-was averted and an agreement was made whereby the matter of a separate consular service was to be considered by a joint committee of members from both countries in 1902. In February 1903, Gustav was once again in Christiana and complained to King Oscar of a ‘terrible state of affairs’ with ‘hardly a single person who now wants to support the present Union, and most of them are openly crying out for its dissolution’ rather ‘than remain…as a vassal of Sweden.’ Although ‘calm’, the Crown Prince admitted that he was ‘prepared for anything.’ On this occasion, Gustav was accompanied by his son Prince Wilhelm.\n\nTo his younger brother Prince Carl, Gustav wrote about the consular crisis on 22 February, 1903 ‘I think that you know enough both of my opinion and the views and thoughts of [Swedish Prime Minister] Boström to know that neither he nor I want to make any further concessions. I consider the Norwegian proposals to be completely unacceptable, well written to be sure, but very insidious.’ In other words, the chance of an accord on the consular matter seemed slim.\n\nNevertheless, despite the Crown Prince’s scepticism, a form of agreement was eventually reached and a subsequent communiqué issued by the joint committee, dated 24 March 1903. This proposed that any relations between the consuls (of both Norway and Sweden) and the still unified Foreign Ministry in Stockholm, as well as with the joint diplomatic missions overseas, should be governed by separate but identical laws, which could not be altered or repealed without the consent of the governments of both Norway and Sweden. Meanwhile, in July, King Oscar ventured to Norway to open the Ofoten Railway- the Norwegian section of a railway which carried iron ore to the port of Narvik.\n\nIn the spring of 1904, Crown Prince Gustav enjoyed a brief respite when he and his eldest son Prince Gustav Adolf participated in some cross-country skiing at Holmenkollen and watched some downhill ski action from the Royal Box. The political problems were not abating. Building upon the agreement reached the previous year, in May 1904, the Norwegian Government presented proposals for inclusion in the new ‘identical’ legislation. However, Swedish Prime Minister Boström’s government proved somewhat truculent and when the Swedes made their response in November of that year, one of their counter-proposals was that the Swedish foreign minister should have sufficient control over the ‘independent’ or ‘separate’ Norwegian consuls so as to prevent them from exceeding their authority. Norway interpreted this as placing their consuls in a subordinate position, effectively still under Swedish control.\n\nIt so happened that the Crown Prince was again in Christiana in the spring of 1905. One of his final vice-regal acts was the appointment, in March, of a coalition government led by Prime Minister Christian Michelsen. The latter announced in his inaugural address that his government would implement ‘Norway’s constitutional right to its own consular service and assert Norway’s sovereignty as a free, independent kingdom.’ On 29 April, Gustav informed his father that ‘The situation here [in Christiana] is utterly hopeless, and it is impossible to speak a reasonable word to a single person.’ Those politicians the Crown Prince encountered were acting like ‘wild dogs’; although to him personally, they were ‘polite, but ice-cold and there is a lot of hatred …in the air’. He now was firmly of the view that ‘I really cannot do any good here’.\n\nThen, in keeping with Michelsen’s inaugural vow, in May 1905 both chambers of the Storting passed the Consular Act, to establish an independent Norwegian consular service, this to be effective from April 1 1906. On 27 May, King Oscar II refused to ratify the legislation during a cabinet meeting at the Swedish Royal Palace with Norway’s senior politician in Stockholm, Jørgen Løvlandat (also in attendance were Crown Prince Gustav, Norwegian ministers Harald Bothner and Edvard Hagerup Bull, as well as August Sibbern, a civil servant from the Norwegian Cabinet Department). Thereafter, the Norwegian government in Christiana duly resigned.\n\nThe crisis deepened when the King was unable to form a new government. In early June, the Prime Minister in Oslo, Christian Michelsen, prepared a statement which he would later make dealing with the current constitutional situation. He posited: It was the monarch’s responsibility to provide Norway with a constitutional government. Since King Oscar had failed to do this, the Norwegian monarchy had now ceased to function. And since it was the King who had bound the union together, these union ties were now broken. On 6 June, Paul Ivar Paulsen, a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Justice in Oslo, travelled to Stockholm on the night train. He had with him the Norwegian government’s final letter of resignation, addressed to the King and signed by Prime Minister Michelsen. The next day, 7 June, Paulsen handed this over to King Oscar II at the Royal Palace, around the same time as the Storting met in plenary session. After listening to the contents of Michelsen’s aforementioned statement, the Norwegian parliament proceeded to pass a resolution to dissolve the union with Sweden. It was then announced that the government ‘until further notice’ would now exercise ‘the authority [previously] granted to the King in accordance with the Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway and applicable laws’. In response, King Oscar sent a telegram to the government in Christiana protesting at this turn of events ‘in the most definite way.’\n\nMeanwhile, the following evening, at Rosendal Castle, where he was currently in residence, Oscar II was joined by his wife and other royal family members to receive a touching tribute from his shocked Swedish subjects, thousands of whom gathered and sang the patriotic song, Ur svenska hjärtans djup [From the Depths of Swedish Hearts]. It was so moving that Queen Sophie and her daughter-in-law Princess Ingeborg (the wife of Prince Carl) could be seen wiping away tears.\n\nIn Christiana, on 8 June, top-ranking men in the military were required to pledge their loyalty to an independent Norway. Then early on the morning of 9 June the Union Flag was ‘struck down’ at Akershus Fortress. At 10am a crowd (estimated at between twenty to thirty thousand) gathered at the Fortress to watch the flag of an independent Norway being raised.\n\nIt is fair to say that the Swedish royal family (as they now must be regarded) were taken aback by the Norwegian position. It was all something of a ‘bombshell’ according to Prince Carl. His younger brother Eugen would later observe that ‘My old father [King Oscar] felt the blow as an insult that he had a hard time digesting.’ On 14 June, King Oscar himself was quoted in the Swedish press talking of ‘this illegal conduct’ on the part of the Norwegians being as ‘an incurable wound’ and paid tribute to ‘my Swedish people.’ Despite the distress, Crown Prince Gustav, who had been in England attending the wedding of his eldest son, Gustaf Adolf to Princess Margaret of Connaught, a niece of Britain’s King Edward VII, now advocated that the dissolution of the union should take place in a peaceful manner.\n\nMeanwhile, a request was sent on 19 June from the Storting to King Oscar asking that negotiations commence for a final settlement on the dissolved union. The following day, King Oscar attended the State Opening of the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) in Stockholm, the Swedish Prime Minister, Ramstedt (who would soon be replaced by Christian Lundeberg) indicated that diplomatic negotiations, the commencement of which required the approval of the Riksdag, should now go ahead with Norway. All the members of Sweden’s State Council agreed with this proposal and King Oscar (keen to avoid what he regarded as the ‘greater evil’ of war) spoke movingly of the many years he had concerned himself with the ‘welfare of the brotherly people’ [i.e. the Norwegians] and how ‘it is painful to me to contribute to the dissolution of a union, in which I thought I saw the independence, security and happiness of both united kingdoms. If I am nevertheless willing to do this, it is to avoid a greater evil and in the conviction that a union without mutual consent would not bring any real advantage to Sweden.’ It should be stated that in Sweden, as in some other nations, the Storting’s actions were regarded as tantamount to a coup or revolution.\n\nHowever, the King decided to appoint Crown Prince Gustav as Regent throughout the period of negotiations. Oscar admitted in a message his people on 7 August that having consulted with his doctors ‘I must now….seek rest and refreshing air… in order to, with God’s help, regain health and strength after the tiring time for body and soul which has been a consequence of the worries which during have followed me for the past few months…’ Of course, the worries over the situation with Norway had actually dogged his reign for decades. Although he did not realise it, Oscar only had a short time to live and he would die in Stockholm in December 1907, at the age of 78.\n\nMeanwhile, on 13 August, the decision of the Storting of 7 June was backed by a referendum in Norway (held at the insistence of Sweden’s Riksdag) which resulted in 368,392 votes in favour of dissolution of the Union, and only 184 against. Negotiations between the delegations from Norway and Sweden took place in the Masonic Lodge in Karlstad from 31 August and lasted till 23 September, when a conditional agreement was reached. The main sticking point was border fortifications between the two nations. In the end several forts were demolished and a neutral zone established which could not be used for military purposes. Any further disputes would be solved by international arbitration. The Karlstad agreement was ratified by the Storting on 9 October; as well as by an extraordinary sitting of the Riksdag on 13 October.\n\nOscar II now formally recognised Norway as an independent state and, on 26 October, he abdicated from the Norwegian throne on behalf of both himself and his successors. The latter words are particularly important, as when the Storting unilaterally dissolved the union with Sweden, it also made an offer (sometimes referred to as the “Bernadotte proposal”) to King Oscar to nominate a prince of the House of Bernadotte to be the new King of an independent Norway. King Oscar wisely demurred fearing that the independence and impartiality of a new monarch in Norway with such close links to him and the House of Bernadotte might be constantly called into question. However, another (Swedish) source quotes him as having been ‘insulted’ by this offer and raging, “Sooner will they carry me to the Riddarholmen Church [at that time the final resting place of Swedish monarchs] than I consent to one of my family going to Norway [as king].” Yet Oscar also sent a final and conciliatory message to his ‘brothers’ in Norway: ‘To those who faithfully served me in Norway during my 30-year reign and who still have some love for their former king, I send my heartfelt thanks and my sincere good wishes in farewell.’\n\nYet the Bernadotte’s were still involved in one last act regarding the future of Norway. On 14 November Crown Prince Gustav of Sweden arrived in Copenhagen. He had been sent as an emissary to make it clear that, despite the recent dissolution of union with Norway, Sweden had no objections to Prince Carl of Denmark’s (the second born son of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark) imminent elevation as King of Norway.\n\nGustav-now King Gustav V of Sweden-returned to Christiana by train from Stockholm for a three-day visit on 28 November 1917 to attend a meeting of the three Scandinavian monarchs. Not only was this Gustav’s first visit since becoming King of Sweden in 1907, it was also the first since the break-up of the Union in 1905. Gustav was now hosted by the Danish-born King Haakon VII in the city and at the Royal Palace he knew so well from his days as Crown Prince of Norway. Haakon’s older brother, King Christian X of Denmark, completed the trio. Gustav hoped that this current visit would demonstrate that the dissolution between Norway and Sweden did not stand in the way of any rapprochement between the two countries. The Swedish king was not disappointed by his reception, as crowds lined the streets to welcome the visiting monarch and his Danish counterpart. Two aeroplanes flew overhead briefly spooking the horses. Local hotels were filled by the curious, many of whom had travelled from western Norway. At the Royal Palace the press reported that the trio of kings feasted on lamb, chicken, ice cream and petit fours.\n\nAnd today relations between the Royal Houses of Norway and Sweden remain extremely close. Sweden’s King has just celebrated his Golden Jubilee and his daughter, Crown Princess Victoria is a popular monarch-in-waiting. Meanwhile, King Harald of Norway, the mother of whom was a Swedish Princess, has reigned for over thirty years. He is the first Norwegian-born monarch of Norway since the Union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905 and he is due to be succeeded, in due course, by his Norwegian-born son Crown Prince Haakon and his Norwegian-born granddaughter, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, both of whose mothers were commoners.\n\nOn 1 May 1920, a ten-year-old girl dressed all in white marches through the streets of her native Stockholm behind a coffin draped in a flag accompanied by her four siblings. All around her in the procession are the great and good from among the royalties of Europe. In the coffin were the mortal remains of the child’s mother, Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden (born Princess Margaret of Connaught, the elder child of Britain’s Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught {third son of Queen Victoria} and his wife Princess Louise of Prussia.) The child in question was ten-year-old Princess Ingrid of Sweden. She was the third child and only daughter of Crown Princess Margareta’s marriage to Crown Prince Gustav Adolf, the eldest child of King Gustav V of Sweden. The royal couple had met in Cairo, in early 1905, and it seems to have been something of a coup de foudre. Prince Gustav Adolf (as he then was) proposed to Princess Margaret at a dinner party given by the British Consul-General in Egypt, Lord Cromer, and they were married at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on 15 June 1905, in the presence of Britain’s King Edward VII, who was pleased by his niece’s union to the Swedish prince, for it was indeed a happy love match. Interestingly, Margaret was not the only English princess to venture to northern Scandinavia that year, as her cousin Maud (a daughter of King Edward VII) arrived in neighbouring Norway as Queen, being the spouse of Prince Charles of Denmark, who was elected as King of Norway following the recent dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. He took the title of King Haakon VII.\n\nIngrid was born in the Royal Palace in central Stockholm on 28 March 1910. A twenty-eight gun salute rang out from the battery at Skeppsholmen to announce the arrival of a princess. She was christened on 10 May in the Royal Chapel. The Crown Prince couple had four other children-all boys: Gustav Adolf (b. 1906), Sigvard (b. 1907), Bertil (b. 1912) and Carl Johan (b. 1916). Being the only daughter, Ingrid and her mother-who unusually for the time breastfed her children-soon formed a close bond, as Margareta preferred to be closely involved in the upbringing of her children, rather than rely heavily on help from a nurse or nanny, as was the case among most European royalties. A visiting Spanish Princess, Eulalia wrote that the Crown Princess gave the Swedish court ‘just a touch of the elegance of the Court of St James’s [in London].’ And here lies the key to Ingrid’s personality: the English influence that was imbued in her from birth by her mother. Soon the young child was immersed in reading English-language nursery books such as ” Kate Greenway’s “Under the Window” or “Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens” by Arthur Packham. Margareta was also a keen gardener and photographer. She indulged herself by taking some wonderful rare colour photographs (for this was after all 1912) of her English-style garden at the family’s summer home, Sofiero Palace, near Helsingborg. These later featured in two books which were published in Sweden and accompanied by illustrations and drawings by the English princess, who counted artists such as the English sculptor Clare Frewen Sheridan as a friend. Often by her side in that wonderful garden was young Ingrid, doubtless entranced by the tripod camera which her mother used to capture such clear images. Another English trait was the use of nicknames en famille. Ingrid became known as ‘Sessan’ or ‘San’, abbreviations of the Swedish word for princess, prinsessan. It goes without saying that English was also widely spoken at Sofiero, although Margareta had been able to speak fluent Swedish within two years of her arrival in Sweden. This fluency in English-without the drawback of a heavy foreign accent-would serve Ingrid well in her future role as Queen of Denmark, as the Scandinavian languages are not widely understood in an international context.\n\nDuring Ingrid’s formative years, Margareta encouraged her children to participate in amateur dramatics. In one play, Ingrid was tasked with playing a princess and was quite insistent that she must have a tiara, ‘otherwise you are not a real princess.’ Ingrid’s brothers were also willing players in these productions, although they were more likely to dress up as sailors. However, all of the children liked nothing better than a game of cowboys and indians in the summer palace garden, with a white conical-shaped tent serving as a tepee. These images were caught for posterity by Margareta on her new cine camera. The camera also captured Ingrid being led on a horse and cart or feeding swans on the boating pond. She was also a bit of a tomboy, happy to indulge in a little football with her brothers or watch a game of curling with her mother and brothers in winter. Yet, Margareta also made sure Ingrid received an education. In old age, Ingrid would recall that ‘I had classes at the [Royal] Palace. My mother …thought [as the only girl] I should have [female] companions’ to study alongside her ‘as she did not think it was a good idea for children to be on their own.’ Some commentators have mentioned that the Princess may have been dyslexic. Like her mother, Ingrid showed an aptitude for art and would later enjoy photography. The family, on occasion, made visits to their grandfather at his home, Bagshot Park, in leafy Berkshire. This further imbued Ingrid with an understanding of English ways and gave her an understanding of her place in the British Royal Family. A particular focus of the day-whether it be at Sofiero, in Stockholm or at Bagshot Park-was afternoon tea. This wonderfully English feast usually consisted of tea, sandwiches, scones and cakes and was served around 4pm-5pm each afternoon.\n\nNonetheless, there was another side to Crown Princess Margareta which Ingrid must have observed. As a British princess, she always understood (for it had been drilled into her) that with privilege came duty. During World War I, Margareta set up a knitting guild to provide garments for the Red Cross. She also put her name to a scheme to encourage women to work on the land. Margareta was also interested in matters involving the welfare of mothers and their children and set up a charity to promote this. She was also Honorary President of the Association for the Blind in Sweden.\n\nIn 1918, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark paid a visit to Sofiero, which was not unusual as the links between the Danish and Swedish royal families were close, both through marriage and descent. At that time Frederik was a mere nineteen and Ingrid but a child of eight. This was also the year that King Gustav V celebrated his 60th birthday and there was a large gathering of the extended royal family, including Ingrid, at Tullgarn Palace. Indeed, images from that time make it clear that there were not many royal family events where Ingrid was not present. Of this period, Ingrid would note that ‘We were children who were happy. Everything was joyful and we were happy in a warm family atmosphere.’ Meanwhile, Ingrid was asked to be a flower girl at the wedding of her mother’s sister, Princess Patricia of Connaught, in 1919. Patsy married the a British naval officer, Captain Alexander Ramsay and relinquished her royal title, being known thereafter as Lady Patricia Ramsay.\n\nIn early 1920, 38-year-old Crown Prince Margareta was pregnant with her sixth child when she had endured a bout of measles which aggravated an ear. An operation then took place for the removal of diseased mastoid air cells. There seem to have been complications, as she died of sepsis (blood poisoning) on 1 May of that year. Ingrid’s father was devastated with grief (‘It was so unexpected’ Ingrid remembered) but gathered his children around him for comfort. Thereafter, he never spoke about their mother to them again, which must have been very difficult for all concerned. The joy had suddenly gone from all of their lives. Ingrid summed it up succinctly, ‘It’s a grief you never overcome. Never, never,’ adding ‘I stopped being a child.’ Crown Princess Margareta’s funeral took place in Stockholm’s Storkyrkan and she was buried in the Royal Cemetery, within the Hagaparken, Solna, with Ingrid looking on. Ingrid would later recall, ‘My mother was a lovely person. Very gifted, also artistic. Also a very practical person and full of energy. She achieved much in her very short life.’\n\nThe appearance of Lady Louise Mountbatten (born a Princess of Battenberg, although her father, Prince Louis renounced his German title during World War I and Anglicised the family name to Mountbatten) must have been something of a shock to Ingrid, who had become something of a surrogate mother figure to her young brothers, as Prince Sigvard recalled. Louise and Gustav Adolf met in London in 1923 when the Crown Prince came over for London ‘season’ with his two eldest children. They had previously met, in August 1914, when Louise and her mother Alice passed through Stockholm on their return journey to England from St Petersburg (where the duo had been on a visit to Alice’s sisters, Tsarina Alexandra and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia [Ella]) at the outbreak of World War I. The British press commented on the fact that Gustav seemed to be paying special attention to Louise as she and Gustav paid visits to the races and spent time at the home of Louise’s brother George, the Marquess of Milford Haven. Louise was apparently nervous and uncertain as to what she should do if the Crown Prince proposed, although her mother urged her to accept, observing that Gustav could offer her a good home and a ready-made family life in a pleasant country. Even after she accepted the proposal, her doubts lingered. At one stage, Louise told a Greek relation that she was too old (she was thirty-four) and too thin to be a bride. Although Prince Gustav Adolf and Prince Sigvard, being in England, were told in person that their father had decided to remarry, their younger siblings, including Ingrid, who had remained at home in Sweden, were given the news by their paternal grandmother, Queen Victoria of Sweden, to whom they were not particularly close. To say that they were surprised would be a gross underestimation. They were not alone, as so were the majority of the Swedish public who had never heard of Louise, despite the fact that she was a great-granddaughter of Britain’s Queen Victoria, as Louise’s maternal grandmother was the late Princess Alice of Great Britain and Ireland, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, the second daughter of the old Queen Empress. The bride-to-be was a thus a first cousin once removed of the late Crown Princess Margareta. Although somewhat set in her ways, Louise had been a nurse during World War I and was deemed a respectable bride for the royal widower due to her royal links and maturity. She also had a democratic outlook which would doubtless appeal to the Swedes. Ingrid is pictured with her father and brother Prince Bertil around this time in England’s “Sphere” magazine of November 1923 and titled “Royal Marriage at St James’s.” This is a reference to the wedding ceremony which took place on 3 November at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace in central London. After a honeymoon in Italy, Louise arrived with her husband by train into Stockholm on a wintry day, 11 December, the guns of Skeppsholmen providing a welcoming salute to Sweden’s new Crown Princess.\n\nThe Crown Prince and his new bride spent the first Christmas at Drottningholm Palace, on the outskirts of Stockholm, with Gustav’s children. King Gustav and Queen Victoria did their best to act as good hosts to their son, his new wife and their grandchildren. As in past times, a giant Christmas tree dominated the room where the children’s presents were arranged on small tables. Games of badminton were played in the ballroom. Otherwise, the newlyweds occupied the same apartments in the Royal Palace as those used by Ingrid’s mother and father during their marriage; there was a similar arrangement at Sofiero (which they still used in the summer). However, Louise and Gustav also refurbished and modernised many rooms at Ulriksdal Palace, during which they were able to put their own stamp on the place. The family made use of this residence in the spring and autumn. It was in many ways neutral ground, for it was not so identified with Margareta. Louise was described as ‘gifted and determined and wanted things her own way.’ She was not perceived as ‘motherly’ and certainly did not have the captivating beauty of Margareta. Ingrid’s youngest brother, Prince Carl Johan, described Louise in his memoirs as shy and a little edgy in manner. But the one who was ‘hesitant’ and had the hardest time receiving this new addition to her family was thirteen-year-old Ingrid who, despite being only ten years old when Margareta died, had become accustomed to taking on the role as her father’s dutiful and diligent mainstay. It may have helped that, although born in Germany, Louise had been raised in England and so was accustomed to English traditions. Her introduction into this close-knit family cannot have been easy and was not helped by the trauma of delivering a still-born child in 1925. Yet, by 1930, she was first lady of Sweden following the death of her mother-in-law, the decidedly pro-German Queen Consort, Victoria. Pictures of this period often show Ingrid accompanying her father and step mother at engagements. Tactfully, Ingrid remains somewhat in the background but has invariably been given a bouquet of flowers similar in size to that of her stepmother. Yet Ingrid was also independent, living life in Stockholm as a modern, active woman. She rode, skied and skated, and was an accomplished tennis player. She learned to drive in 1928. Ingrid was also something of a royal style icon, draped in ostrich plumes, rubies and silk lames when for gala dinners.\n\nThe late 1920’s and early 1930’s were a further time of royal Swedish marriages. Ingrid’s father’s cousin Astrid married Belgium’s Crown Prince Leopold in November 1926, while Astrid’s sister Märtha married Crown Prince Olav of Norway in March 1929. Ingrid was a bridesmaid at both of these weddings, travelling to Brussels and Oslo for the festivities. She had often been in the company of these sisters prior to their marriage and still often met up with them during their visits home to Sweden, usually at Fridhem, the country home of Astrid and Märtha’s parents, Danish-born Princess Ingeborg and her husband Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland. In 1932, Ingrid’s eldest brother, Prince Gustav Adolf (‘Edmund’), married Princess Sybilla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Sybilla’s father, Charles Edward, was the British-born son of Queen Victoria’s eighth child and youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany. Although raised in England until the age of fifteen, Charles eventually moved to Germany, where he subsequently inherited the Dukedom of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900. As the 1930’s progressed the Duke became increasingly admiring of and involved with Hitler’s Third Reich, rising to the rank of SS Obergruppenführer in 1936. He continued to maintain close links with the British Royal Family. His sister was Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, a sister-in-law of Britain’s Queen Mary. Interestingly, Ingrid was to serve as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Alice’s daughter, Lady May Cambridge to Henry Abel-Smith in October 1931. Her future sister-in-law, Sybilla, was also a bridesmaid. Meanwhile, in 1934, Ingrid’s elder brother Sigvard was stripped of his royal rank when he married Erica Maria Patzek, the daughter of a German businessman. The same would apply when Ingrid’s younger brother Carl Johan married journalist Elin Wijkmark in 1946.\n\nBut what of Ingrid’s future? She was certainly ideally placed to make an excellent dynastic marriage. When the heir to the British throne, the Prince of Wales (David) and his brother Prince George visited Stockholm in 1932. Ingrid’s name was briefly linked romantically with David. In 1933, Ingrid, who was on a visit to her English family, was pictured at Wimbledon alongside David’s mother, Queen Mary. The latter would certainly have approved of such a marriage, given the close dynastic links between the British and Swedish royal families. Yet it was not to be: The future King Edward VIII, would fall into disgrace when he abdicated his throne, in December 1936, to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Talk of a royal romance was temporarily put on the back burner, when in late 1934, Ingrid undertook a five-month journey to the Middle East by sea and plane, in the company of her father, Crown Princess Louise and her younger brother Bertil, visiting archaeological sites (the Crown Prince was a keen archaeologist throughout his life) and examining priceless artefacts in Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Jerusalem (Palestine) and Jordan.\n\nShortly after Ingrid’s 25th birthday, it was announced, by the Swedish and Danish Royal Courts that she was to marry Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik. Ingrid and Frederik seem to have been involved romantically for around two years, although the press had not picked up on this. Frederik had travelled over to Stockholm for the announcement but eluded the waiting press by leaving his train beforehand at Södertälje, where Ingrid was waiting in her car to drive the Crown Prince to the Royal Palace. Frederik was very much a man of the sea. Unlike most incumbents to the Danish throne, he had joined the Danish navy, as opposed to taking a commission in the armed forces. He underwent an exacting four-year spell at the Naval Cadet School in Copenhagen’s Gernersgade, together with periods spent on board the cadet ships Heimdal and Valkyrien. At his parents’ insistence, he was treated the same as any other naval cadet. Frederik was outgoing and cheerful and at ease with himself and the man in the street. He smoked a pipe and had a deep love of music and tattoos! By the time of his marriage, he had risen to the rank of Captain. It has been said that after her marriage to Frederik, Ingrid-who could be strict with herself and others-softened somewhat under his influence. The wedding in Stockholm saw a gathering of the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian royal families with some Prussian ex-royals, such as Crown Princess Cecilie also present. In addition, many of Ingrid’s British relations attended including her mother’s sister, Lady Patricia Ramsay (‘Patsy’), her mother’s cousin, Princess Helena Victoria (‘Thora’) and her mother’s sister-in-law, Princess Arthur of Connaught. The latter was also Margareta’s first cousin once removed (and thus Ingrid’s second cousin), as she was the eldest daughter of the late Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife, the eldest daughter of King Edward VII (and niece of the Duke of Connaught). Stockholm was filled with joy and cheering crowds as Ingrid entered the Storkyrkan, on 24 May, on the arm of her father wearing a wedding veil of Irish lace which had belonged to her mother. Instead of a tiara, she wore a crown of English myrtle grown in Margareta’s garden at Sofiero. The ceremony was broadcast on Swedish radio.\n\nFollowing the wedding, the plan had been that the newlyweds would travel south through Sweden by rail and then cross over to Copenhagen by sea in a Danish navy vessel. The Danish Royal Yacht, Dannebrog, had brought the Danish King and Queen and Crown Frederik to Stockholm for the wedding (the Danish suite being received with great fanfare and brought ashore in the ornate Vasaorden, the Swedish Royal Barge.) The Dannebrog was normally only used to transport the Danish Sovereign. It had certainly not, up until now, been put at the disposal of the Crown Prince. However, Ingrid thought it would be wonderful if she and her husband could travel to Denmark together aboard the Royal Yacht. Crown Prince Frederik was sceptical, feeling it unlikely that King Christian would grant such a request. However, such was Ingrid’s determination and charm that she won over her father-in-law, who graciously consented to permit this. A gun salute greeted the new bride as the Dannebrog arrived in Copenhagen. Even better, both King Christian and his wife, Queen Alexandrine, were waiting on the quayside to greet the new Crown Princess of Denmark as she landed in her adopted homeland and passed under a bridal arch festooned with flowers. After receiving a large bouquet, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were taken in an open carriage to the Amalienborg where they appeared on the balcony to the acclaim of the large crowd below. A banquet was held that evening at Christiansborg Palace. Meanwhile, the country’s bakers sold Ingrid cakes and Ingrid confectionery, and many citizens had put pictures of Ingrid on display in the windows as a salutation to their new Crown Princess.\n\nDuring their summer honeymoon, the couple stayed in Rome for a period of time, and invariably returned to the city almost every autumn when they could move around the streets or eat in backstreet trattoria unrecognised and undisturbed. However, they were returning to a country that was suffering, like others in Europe, from the economic downturn. Ingrid (who quickly mastered Danish and took lessons in Danish history) was soon, as Crown Princess of Denmark, at the forefront of many royal engagements, such as the Silver Jubilee celebrations for King Christian X in 1937. It is fair to say that Ingrid helped improve relations between her husband and his ageing father, who could be irascible. Queen Margrethe remembers that, ‘My mother wasn’t afraid [of the King as many members of the family were], she was used to dealing with older, slightly stiff gentlemen – there were so many old gentlemen in the Swedish family. It didn’t occur to her that she should be afraid of him, and in turn, he actually adored her,’ Ingrid’s charitable patronages at this time focused on those concerned with children and youths. Ingrid was involved too with the Girl Scouts and attended a summer camp. A Lady-in-Waiting Sybille Bruun was appointed to assist her. Sybille’s father had been the Danish envoy to Sweden at the time of her marriage. Meanwhile, for relaxation, Ingrid and Frederik built a small hunting lodge by Bjørnsholm Bay, at Trend in Vesthimmerland municipality using funds donated in 1937 from a ‘folk gift’ as the Crown Prince loved to hunt.\n\nIngrid and Frederik often travelled outside of Denmark on official business. In 1937, they made an official visit to Paris. Thereafter, in 1939, they undertook a two-month tour of the United States, visiting San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and New York, where they attended the World Fair. Ingrid charmed President and Mrs Roosevelt, with whom she and her husband dined, which was fortuitous as one of the main objects of the tour was to foster closer relations with the United States government, as the possibility of war in Europe grew ever nearer. The rise of Hitler and his Third Reich had long cast a long shadow over the continent, particularly after his annexation of the Sudetenland in October 1938. En route home from the United States, Ingrid and Frederik stopped off briefly in London to see her eighty-nine year old grandfather, the Duke of Connaught. It was fortuitous that she did as soon international travel would soon become impossible.\n\nWhen wore broke out in Europe, in the autumn of 1939, Denmark declared itself to be neutral. However, German forces (around 40,000 men) invaded in the early hours of 9 April 1940. Crown Princess Ingrid, heavily pregnant with her first child, was ‘furious’ and apparently let out a rare expletive to give vent to her feelings, as she lay in her bedroom at the Frederick VIII Palace of the Amalienborg, the Crown Princely couple’s residence in Copenhagen. Some of the fiercest fighting took place nearby in the Amaliegade and Bredgade. Many of the royal guards were injured as they bravely sought to hold off the intruders. In the end the King negotiated a cease fire, for he must have realised that otherwise many more of his guards would have been killed, for they were outnumbered. Officially, Germany claimed to be protecting Denmark from a British and French invasion. Danish-language leaflets were dropped from Luftwaffe planes to spread this propaganda to the masses. With the German military now firmly on the ascendant, a coalition government now chose to ‘cooperate’ with the occupying power to protect the country from the consequences of the war. Some would argue that what followed was more a process of ‘negotiation’ than cooperation for, whereas in other occupied countries an independent German administration was established, in Denmark it was still the Danish authorities who had the formal responsibility for governing. Nonetheless, German troops continued to maintain a highly visible presence and Danish citizens’ rights were restricted.\n\nDuring these dark times of World War 2, Copenhageners became accustomed to Ingrid and Frederik taking walks through the capital with their newly-born daughter, Margrethe, who was born just a week after the German incursion, an event which was seen as a positive symbol of light in the darkness. Danish spirits were also lifted by the sight of Frederik’s father, King Christian X, taking morning rides, in military uniform, through the streets of Copenhagen, cheered on by crowds of well wishers. It is something that Ingrid encouraged him to keep doing. The Crown Prince and his wife also took to using bicycles whenever possible, again as an emblem of solidarity with the man-in-the-street. These were symbols of a determined defiance to the government policy of ‘cooperation’, which officially the King supported. Ingrid, meanwhile, joined the Danish Women’s Preparedness organisation. Of this war period, Ingrid would later tell her daughter, Margrethe, that she and Crown Prince Frederik felt ‘so ashamed.’ The Crown Princess was no fan of the Nazis and would recall that, a few years earlier, she had been required to dine with Hermann Göring, and thought him dreadful. Apparently, King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine (who was born and raised in northern Germany in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) also felt aggrieved by the situation. Yet, no matter what their personal feelings were, the royal family all had to put on a polite public face for the sake of their countrymen and countrywomen. One telling image shows Ingrid and her husband at a animal show in the company of Prime Minister Vilhelm Buhl. The normally kind and outgoing Crown Prince looks decidedly ill-at ease, although Ingrid, who is seated next to Buhl, manages to look politely interested in the proceedings, as she holds on to a bouquet of flowers. Ingrid and her husband also visited areas where there had been bomb damage. In the autumn of 1942, the Danish Prime Minister gave his famous ‘anti-sabotage’ speech, urging the Danes to desist from acts of sabotage (which were on the increase). It is fair to say that his words would not have found favour with the Crown Prince and his wife. After a fall from his horse on 19 October 1942, King Christian X was more or less an invalid throughout the rest of his reign, so an increasing amount of the burden fell on Crown Prince Frederik (who acted as Regent for periods thereafter) and Ingrid. Interestingly, the Danes had now taken princess to their hearts. She was no longer referred to as ‘the Swedish Princess’ but as ‘our Crown Princess.’\n\nIt was not until 29 August 1943, when the Germans declared a ‘Military State of Emergency’, that the policy of cooperation between the Danish government and the Germans broke down. This development came about as a result of a change in public sentiment in Denmark which manifested itself in further sabotage activity (for instance the Danish navy sunk many of its own ships at Holmen rather than see them seized by the Germans; while civilian acts of sabotage were directed against companies that supplied or worked with the Germans). Civil unrest (including strikes and riots) was also on the increase in several major cities. Then, on the night of October 2, the occupying forces tried to round up Danish Jews. However, more than 7,000 Danish Jews were helped to escape by the Danish resistance to Sweden, although around 470 were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. It has recently emerged that, in all probability, King Christian gave money to assist with costs involved in the transportation of the Jews to safety, after an appeal was made to him by two nurses sent from a local hospital from where this evacuation effort was coordinated. Meanwhile, under what was effectively martial law, the King and his family were placed under house arrest at Sorgenfri Castle by the German authorities. The Danish parliament ceased to function and the government resigned rather than agree to a German ‘request’ to introduce the death penalty for saboteurs. Queen Margrethe feels that, ‘from that point on, I don’t think father and mother were ashamed of Denmark.’ Jon Bloch Skipper, royal historian and author, who wrote a biography of King Frederik IX, states that Ingrid and her husband were certainly aware of the activities of the Danish resistance at this time and, in all probability, met with some of them at the Amalienborg.\n\nThe Crown Princess and her husband had a second child, Benedikte in April 1944. Meanwhile, opposition to the German occupiers continued apace with further strikes in Copenhagen and other towns in Zealand, Lolland-Falster and South Jutland. Then, in September 1944, several thousand Danish police were sent to concentration camps by the increasingly embattled occupiers. In addition, Ingrid faced the same problem as other Danish women in relation to finding suitable clothes for her children to wear. She decided to make use of her wedding dress from which she made baby jackets with hoods for her daughters (a third daughter, Anne-Marie was born in August 1946).\n\nOn 5 May 1945, Denmark was officially free of German control. Citizens all over the country took down the black blinds that had been used to cover their windows during bombing raids and made bonfires of them in the streets. Two months later, Ingrid’s father and stepmother came over from Sweden for a stay at Fredensborg. The Swedish Crown Prince was delighted to see his daughter, son-in-law and his granddaughters Margaretha and Benedikte. However, both he and Ingrid were devastated by the death, in an air crash, of Prince Gustav Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten in January 1947. He was only forty years of age and left behind a widow (Sybilla) and five children, the youngest of whom, an only son Prince Carl Gustav, would one day ascend the throne of Sweden. The accident occurred on Danish soil, near Copenhagen’s Kastrup airport, following a stopover there. The prince was flying home to Sweden from a hunting holiday in the Netherlands with Prince Bernhard. The plane stalled almost immediately after take off and ploughed nose first to the ground. The six crew and sixteen passengers were all killed. A heavily-veiled Ingrid attended the funeral in Stockholm on 4 February. 100,000 were said to have lined the streets.\n\nJust as Ingrid was recovering from the trauma of the her brother’s funeral, King Christian X died on 20 April. Ingrid was now Queen Consort of Denmark. Her husband, the new King, Frederik IX, was so proclaimed from the balcony at Christiansborg Palace and gave a brief speech: ‘The two of us will now take over and continue in the same spirit as the former royal couple.’ Then he gave Queen Ingrid a hearty kiss on the cheek. One cannot imagine King Christian and Queen Alexandrine behaving in such a spontaneous manner. It was perhaps apt that one of their first official guests, in 1948, was Danish-born King Haakon VII of Norway (‘Uncle Charles’). Like his nephew Frederik, Haakon had previously served as a naval officer in the Danish navy. Then, in 1952, the royal couple would host Ingrid’s father and his wife Louise on a State Visit to Denmark. Overseas State Visits also abounded, including one by Frederik and Ingrid to London in May 1951 and then to Vienna in 1952.\n\nAlthough the heir to the throne was now Frederik’s younger brother, Hereditary Prince Knud, discussions were taking place to change the rules of succession. In Denmark, these changes were enacted via The Succession to the Throne Act of 27 March 1953 which introduced conditional female succession in Denmark as of 5 June. This meant that a female descendant of the current reigning sovereign could now inherit the throne, providing that there was no male heir, which, of course, in King Frederik IX’s case, there was not as all his children were daughters. Ingrid and Frederik’s eldest child, Margrethe, was now referred to as Crown Princess Margrethe. This changed occurred just as the role of Danish women were becoming more prevalent in the workplace. Some press sources noted that the (now) Prince Knud referred to his sister-in-law as ‘King Ingrid’ as it was she who really pulled the strings at the Amalienborg. Other commentators say Ingrid was a (or the) motivating force behind the change. However, it is highly unlikely that this change in the succession would have incurred without support from the average Dane in the street.\n\nQueen Ingrid, meanwhile, helped her husband to transform the monarchy from a distant, aloof institution into an outward-looking, accessible institution. In particular, she was aware of the need to promote the monarchy in a fast-changing world, while also adapting it to suit new circumstances. Photographers (such as Britain’s Patrick Lichfield [the mother of whom married Prince Georg of Denmark]) were given access and invariably produced images of a loving family of three daughters watched over by a doting father and loving mother. Nevertheless, in these pictures, the steely side of Queen Ingrid also shines through. A former guard at the Palace once told the writer that while the princesses were relatively relaxed and informal, Ingrid was decidedly more formal. Nevertheless, the King was said to have the ability to make his wife relax; while she contributed greatly to Fredrik appearing more dignified and confident in his role as monarch. In effect, the duo complimented each other perfectly. The Royal Court also allowed the cameras into the palace to film at teatime. In doing this, Ingrid gives a nod to her English mother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, in a wonderful film sequence of her acting as ‘Mother’, in the traditional English way, pouring and distributing afternoon tea to her husband and daughters. Princess Benedikte recalled that the hour between 4pm and 5pm was almost sacrosanct and if, for any reason, the Queen was delayed for reasons of duty, the palace staff ensured that everything was made ready for her to take tea on her return home. Teatime also provided the family with a rare opportunity to indulge in some candid conversation, as no staff were present. Another occupation with English overtones was Ingrid’s love of gardening, particularly at Graasten Palace-her summer home until the end of her long life and of course at Fredensborg.\n\nQueen Ingrid now expanded her official duties. She showed a great interest in matters relating to Greenland, following her visit with the King in the summer of 1952 aboard the Dannebrog. Ingrid was particularly concerned to learn that many of the Greenlanders were affected by tuberculosis. Thereafter, partly thanks to her interest, a new hospital was built and opened in 1954 in Nuuk (then Godthab) bearing her name (originally this dealt with pulmonary diseases but has now expanded into a general hospital). The King and Queen paid several visits together to Greenland (1952, 1960 and 1968) and the Faroe Islands (1959, 1963, 1969). Meanwhile, in Copenhagen there were several high-profile engagements concerned with European and international affairs: In May 1950, Ingrid attended a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Copenhagen. In February 1953, the King and Queen were present at a meeting of the first Scandinavian Council held at Christiansborg, during which closer political ties in Europe were discussed. Ingrid then assisted her husband in hosting an important lunch at Fredensborg Palace for foreign ministers attending a NATO conference. There continued to be a plethora of incoming State Visits. A particularly poignant one, given the recent history of Denmark, was the visit by the President of West Germany, Gustav Heinemann and his wife Hilda, in 1970. One with a more family feel was an earlier visit by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1957. The Danish royal couple also made many more visits overseas. In 1960 they again visited the United States, followed in 1962 by a visit to Thailand. They travelled to Africa too, visiting Emperor Haile Selassie in Addis Ababa in 1970. There was also a visit to Iran, in 1971, in connection with the celebrations at Persepolis to commemorate 2500 years of the founding of the Persian Empire. Ingrid and her husband also paid a visit to the Vatican, in 1959, during which they were received in audience by Pope John XXIII.\n\nOn 21 July 1962, Ingrid attended the confirmation service of her nephew Crown Prince Carl Gustav at Borgholms Church on the island of Öland. She liked to visit her homeland and kept in close touch with her father and her late brother’s children, as well as his widow Sybilla. Forays continued also to England. In 1952, Ingrid took her three daughters on a visit to London, said by the press to be the children’s first overseas visit. She was also photographed, in 1957, with Queen Elizabeth II and her family watching a game of polo at Smith’s Lawn in Windsor. Ingrid’s closeness, not to mention loyalty, to her British relatives was emphasised by the fact that she was the sole foreign royal to attend the 1960 wedding of Princess Margaret to the photographer, Anthony (‘Tony’) Armstrong-Jones. Other European royalties stayed clear of this unequal marital union of a king’s daughter to a commoner.\n\nQueen Louise of Sweden died on March 7, 1965 in Stockholm. Ingrid was present during the Swedish Queen’s final illness and kindly kept Louise’s brother, Lord Louis Mountbatten (who was on a trip to Australasia) appraised of the situation. A further development around this time was that Crown Princess Margaretha had met and fallen in love with a French aristocrat and diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who at the time was on the staff of the French Embassy in London. The couple married at the Holmens Kirke in Copenhagen on 10 June 1967. Margrethe wore a diamond daisy brooch which was a nod to her English grandmother, Margareta, who had been known by the family nickname of ‘Daisy’. Interestingly, Margrethe was also already known en famille as ‘Daisy’.\n\nOn 3 January 1972, King Frederik, who was suffering from a bad attack of flu, had a heart attack. Fortunately his doctor happened to be at the Amalienborg at the time, so he was hospitalised immediately and seemed to improve after a few days, but then his condition deteriorated and he died on the evening of 14 January. Ingrid had visited him faithfully every day at the Kommunehospitalet. Aged only sixty-two, she was a relatively young, fit and healthy widow facing a future without her husband of thirty-six years. Queen Ingrid (as she continued to be known) remained at her home in the Amalienborg complex, but moved out of the main palace at Fredensborg into the Chancellery House, a long, low wing, which is connected to the main palace buildings via the adjoining stable block and royal chapel. She also continued to have the use of Graasten Palace in South Jutland, where she loved nothing better than to do her embroidery or work in the English-style garden she had helped to create ever since she and her husband had first taken over the palace as their summer residence in the 1930’s. Visits from her children and their families were particularly welcome and Ingrid soon started to travel overseas, attending events in Oslo, in August 1972, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late King Haakon VII (who had been born at Denmark’s Charlottenlund Palace in 1872). At home, she attended the opening of the Annual Meeting of the World Bank in Copenhagen in 1973. Queen Ingrid would serve many times as regent during her daughter’s absences abroad. Until then, this function was traditionally reserved for those in line to the throne.\n\nThe death of her father, King Gustav VI Adolf, on September 15, 1973, was hardly unexpected given his great age. She had been by his side when he died in Helsingborg Hospital and was pictured leaving afterwards with her nephew, the new King Carl XVI Gustav and her niece Princess Christina. She later walked immediately behind the new King during the funeral procession in Stockholm. This meant that in just over a year Ingrid had lost the two men who had meant the most to her. Yet, she still faced the future with gusto. This included giving the benefit of her experience, if required: When her nephew, the King of Sweden found a future queen in the delightful and talented Silvia Sommerlath (they had met during the summer Olympics in Munich in 1972), Ingrid welcomed Miss Sommerlath to Denmark for three days to discuss her future role as a Queen Consort of Sweden and all that this would entail. Ingrid even drove herself out to the airport at Kastrup in her Jaguar car to greet Silvia off her flight. Some of the press referred to these discussions as ‘Queen Lessons.’ Silvia would later speak of Ingrid’s ‘tremendous wisdom’ noting too that ‘I could always telephone her if I had a question.’ Furthermore, ‘She had a lot of warmth but also a certain distance. She was easy to talk to and awe-inspiring. You weren’t afraid of her, but you had a lot of respect for her.’ Ingrid attended the couple’s wedding in Stockholm in June 1976, seated between King Olav of Norway and her brother Prince Bertil. With his nephew now settled, Bertil now decided to marry his long-time love, a Welsh actress, Lilian Craig. Ingrid attended the wedding in Stockholm on 7 December. Unlike his two surviving brothers, he retained the title of His Royal Highness.\n\nA source of worry during this period was the fate of her youngest daughter, Anne-Marie, who had married King Constantine of the Hellenes in 1964. Greece had always been a politically volatile country and the Greek royal family had been accustomed to spending long periods in exile in the first half of the 20th century. On 21 April 1967, a group of army colonels overthrew the caretaker government a month before scheduled elections in which Georgios Papandreou’s Centre Union was favoured to win. At one stage, tanks surrounded Constantine and Anne-Marie’s home at Tatoi, outside Athens. Following an unsuccessful attempt at a counter-coup, planned over many months by the King and officers loyal to the crown, Anne-Marie and her husband, accompanied by their children, as well as the dowager queen Frederika and Constantine’s sister Irene, had made a sudden dash by air to Rome, in December 1967, with barely any fuel left in the tank of their small plane. The family lived initially at the Greek Embassy, then in a villa on the outskirts of Rome. Ingrid had a chance to have a catch up with Anne-Marie when she arrived in Copenhagen, in January 1968, to attend the wedding, on 3 February, at Fredensborg’s Royal Chapel of her older sister Benedikte to the German Prince Richard Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. King Constantine did not attend this event (neither had he nor Anne-Marie been able to attend Crown Princess Margrethe’s nuptials the previous year, for it had been made clear [‘advised’] by the Danish government that Constantine should stay away. Queen Ingrid had responded to this ‘advice’ by placing pictures of the Greek King and Queen throughout the rooms of Fredensborg Palace where Margrethe’s wedding reception was held). Greece was declared a republic in 1973. Following the restoration of a democratic government in 1974, a referendum was held to decide the future of the Greek monarchy: 69% of Greek citizens were in favour of a republic; only 31% were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy. When the Greek royal family eventually relocated to England in 1974 and settled in a roomy home in Hampstead, Ingrid was able to make regular visits over to London, where she spent much of her time gardening. Queen Ingrid must have reflected back to a warm September day in 1964, when she and King Frederik had sailed into Piraeus, the port for Athens, on board the Dannebrog with Anne-Marie at their side, to be greeted by a flotilla of local ships hooting their horns accompanied by a twenty-one-gun salute to welcome their future queen consort.\n\nIn the meantime, Ingrid’s growing band of grandchildren were a source of pleasure. She was particularly close to Crown Prince Frederik, Margrethe and Henrik’s eldest son, who was born in 1968. She also saw a lot of his younger brother, Prince Joachim, who followed in 1969. Anne-Marie and Constantine had a very large family over an extended time scale. Their first-born (and Ingrid’s first grandchild) was a daughter Alexia, born in Corfu in July 1965. The royal couple then went on to have four more children, Pavlos (born in 1967), Nikolaos (1969), Theodora (1983) and Ingrid’s youngest grandchild, Prince Philippos, who was born in London in 1986. In 1973 Ingrid was pictured on a boating lake, during an excursion to Legoland in Jutland. with her daughter Benedikte’s two eldest children Gustav (born in 1969) and Alexandra (born in 1970). Benedikte would go on to have a third child, Nathalie, in 1975.\n\nAs the 1980’s dawned, Ingrid could not help but be concerned by the behaviour of her son-in-law, Prince Henrik. The latter had to establish a role for himself at the Danish Court as he was the first male consort in Denmark’s history. Not an easy matter when there are no established boundaries, no dedicated funds, initially, with which to run an office and you are also constantly criticised in the press for speaking indifferent Danish with a foreign accent! Henrik eventually stated, in public, that he wished to have his own dedicated civil list allowance, instead of relying on handouts from the Queen’s allowance. Danes were outraged with the ‘French prince’. Ingrid was concerned enough to send for a copy of an English newspaper which had carried a report on the situation, according to Nigel Dempster, a well-known gossip columnist of the time, based in London.\n\nIngrid appeared on the balcony alongside her daughter Margrethe to celebrate her 80th birthday in March 1990. The following year, she paid to a visit to Japan, accompanied by Queen Anne-Marie, where she was pictured admiring a collection of orchids in the company of the Japanese royal family. During the 1990s, Ingrid suffered from scoliosis and there was a gradual deterioration in her general health. In her final years, she sometimes made use of a walking frame to move around, and then often one that matched whatever she happened to wearing at the time – her sense of style was still very much intact. Ingrid never forgot her origins or stopped taking an interest in Sweden. Her daughters recalled, for instance, that she persisted in reading Svenska Dagbladet every morning throughout her life.\n\nIt was unusual for Ingrid to give public speeches and when she did it was with a written script which she followed to the letter, a no-nonsense pair of glasses all the better to read it with. But on the occasion of Margrethe II’s 25th anniversary as Queen of Denmark, in January 1997, she surprised everyone by making a rare exception at a banquet to celebrate this milestone. The closing words of the speech were: ‘And Daisy [Margrethe’s nickname], you have two wonderful sons, so I think I can now safely close my eyes, because they will do their best for Denmark.’ A realist, Ingrid knew in her heart that her days were numbered. Yet, she was able to travel over to London to attend the wedding of her eldest grandchild, Alexia, in July 1999, even attending the wedding ball in a cerise pink ensemble. For her 90th birthday, she was photographed in a family group at the Chancellery House with her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and her brother Carl Johan Bernadotte. On November 7, 2000, Ingrid died aged 90 (the same age at which her late father had died) at the Chancellery House, surrounded by her large family (three children and ten grand children), including her beloved Crown Prince Frederik, who arrived in the nick of time from a visit to Australia where he had been attending the Olympic Games.\n\nIngrid was laid to rest alongside her late husband, King Frederik IX at Roskilde Cathedral on 14 November, having made the final journey by train from Copenhagen. Highly revered, her funeral was attended by the King and Queen of Sweden, the Queen of the Netherlands, the King and Queen of Norway, the King of the Belgians (the younger son of the late Queen Astrid of the Belgians), Britain’s Prince Charles (representing his mother, Queen Elizabeth II), the Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg (the latter was the late Queen Astrid of the Belgian’s daughter) and Queen Sofia of Spain.\n\nRobert Prentice is the author of the biography the Greek-born Princess Olga of Yugoslavia: Her Life and Times. Available as a hardback from Amazon UK, Amazon.com and Amazon Deutschland. Olga was a Princess of Greece and Denmark and was briefly engaged to the future King Frederik IX in 1922.\n\nPrincess Ragnhild of Norway was born on 9 June 1930 at the Royal Palace in Oslo, where her parents, Crown Prince Olav and his Swedish-born wife, Crown Princess Märtha had decamped some three weeks before, as a fire had almost destroyed their family home at Skaugum, in the village of Asker, west of Oslo. Ragnhild was the first Norwegian Princess born on Norwegian soil in over six hundred years. In her autobiography (published in 1995), Princess Ragnhild relates how her Swedish mother was anxious that her first-born child should come into the world on the 25th anniversary of the dissolution of Norway’s union with Sweden (7 June 1930), so that target was missed by two days! However, despite being the eldest child of the Crown Prince, Ragnhild was not destined to become queen, as at that time there was no right of succession to the throne of Norway for females. Had she been born under the constitutional rules of today, the Princess would eventually have succeeded her father Olav as Queen of Norway.\n\nWhen a mere two and a half weeks old, Ragnhild was baptized by Bishop Johan Lunde in the Royal Palace Chapel in Oslo.
