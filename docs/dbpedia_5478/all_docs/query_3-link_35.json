        "text": "By August Strindberg\n\nTranslated by Wendy Weckwerth\n\nVolume 6, Issue 4 (Fall 2017)\n\nStrindberg’s Gustav Adolf: A Brief Intro to a Long Play\n\nI’m on something of a mission with Strindberg’s history plays—bringing these well-crafted plays to the attention of English-speaking theater makers and scholars. Of Strindberg’s approximately sixty plays, nearly a third are history plays—and he wrote them from the start of his writing career to the end. They display many of the same innovative dramatic structures that Strindberg implemented over his three decades of writing for the theater. His history plays not only embellish our dramatic repertoire; as a group they offer a vital, and largely unexplored, window into Strindberg’s work.\n\nMy first encounter with this group of history plays was reading the translations done by prolific mid-century Strindberg scholar Walter Johnson. Those translations piqued my interest, and they demonstrated that the passage of more than half a century has created ample space for fresh, playable American translations.\n\nGustav Adolf (1900) isn’t just Strindberg’s longest historical drama—it’s his longest play, full stop. If you were inspired to stage every scene of its five acts, you’d be in for at least a seven-hour theater experience.\n\nThe play dramatizes the last two years of the reign of Swedish king Gustav II Adolf (b. 1594, d. 1632), during which time he was engaged in the Thirty Years’ War (the same conflict at the center of Bertolt Brecht’s 1939 play Mother Courage and Her Children). Referencing Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s 1779 masterpiece, Strindberg called Gustav Adolf his Nathan the Wise, because it pairs the realities of a violent religious conflict with the burgeoning promise of religious tolerance. These are concerns that resonate throughout history, and are still at the crux of a number of violent conflicts today.\n\nIn Gustav Adolf, Gustav is a new iteration of Strindberg’s “characterless character,” a term he coined in his preface to Miss Julie to describe a “vacillating and disintegrating,” conglomerate of impulses, motivations, and cultural nurturing. Which is to say that “characterless” figures, according to Strindberg, transcend character type: a “fixed” sense in which a character’s temperament and actions are both quickly interpreted and consistent throughout a text.\n\nIn Strindberg’s post-Inferno dramas (those he wrote after the period of years commonly referred to as his Inferno crisis, 1894 to 1896), his central characters also call into question the stability of their dramatic realities. Strindberg employs this theatricalist strategy to keep us aware at all times that we’re watching a performance (or, as may be the case, reading a text intended to be embodied on a stage).\n\nAnother resonance with Miss Julie is that Gustav Adolf can be described as largely naturalistic in its style. Nonetheless, alongside its somewhat chiaroscuro naturalism, a particular source of delight for me is Gustav Adolf’s frequent self-consciousness—the wink-wink, nudge-nudge quality of its situational ironies. The play also features a parade of high and low characters—part of a seemingly endless cast of sixty—who come together to offer a wide-angle view of the Thirty Years’ War and it destructive consequences.\n\nOne of the challenges of translating Strindberg’s history plays is capturing the quotidian quality of his Swedish. Rather than trying to re-create the antiquated diction of the seventeenth century, the era in which Gustav Adolf is set, Strindberg uses the Swedish of his own moment. Rendering conversational banter, with its exclamations and interjections, is a perennial concern of translation, and it was a challenge for this piece, as was addressing Strindberg’s many allusions to Swedish history, unknown to most outside of Scandinavia. Instead of offering copious footnotes, I’ve opted to let the references exist within the play on their own terms, though readers may wish to keep a Web browser handy. In the event of a production, they could be addressed relatively simply through small trims or minor, contextualizing additions. The play’s unwieldy length could be adjusted with judicious trimming.\n\nIt’s all there for the plucking in Gustav Adolf—an engaging historical drama waiting to be staged.\n\n—Wendy Weckwerth\n\nDuring his forty-year career, Swedish dramatist, painter, experimental photographer, philosopher, scientist, and historian August Strindberg (1849–1912) created more than sixty plays. His dramaturgical innovations—e.g., the naturalist crucible of Miss Julie (1888), the expressionist journey of To Damascus I and II (1898), and the associative prism that is A Dream Play (1901)—helped usher in theatrical modernism. Nearly one-third of Strindberg’s almost sixty dramas are historical plays, yet they are almost unknown among English-speaking theater scholars and artists, and they’ve rarely been produced outside of Sweden.\n\nAs a Minneapolis-based freelance dramaturg, translator, editor, and teacher, Wendy Weckwerth is committed to collaboratively crafting stories about the human experience. In addition to new-play dramaturgy and editing book manuscripts, one of her ongoing projects is translating August Strindberg’s history plays—her translation of Kristina premiered at the August Strindberg Repertory Theatre in 2015, and her translation of Gustav Adolf had a staged reading there in 2014. She has also completed translations of Strindberg’s Erik XIV and Karl XII. Her translation of Ingmar Bergman’s screenplay for Autumn Sonata was the basis for Robert Woodruff’s adaptation that premiered at Yale Rep in 2011. Wendy has taught at Yale, Dartmouth, Colby, Mount Holyoke, and Bard Colleges. She holds a bachelor’s degree from Vassar College, and master of fine arts and doctor of fine arts degrees from Yale School of Drama.\n\nGustav Adolf\n\n1900\n\nCharacters\n\nGustav Adolf, age 36\n\nMaria Eleanora, his consort, Elector of Brandenburg’s sister, age 31\n\nAxel Oxenstierna, chancellor, age 47\n\nFabricius, court pastor\n\nGrubbe, the king’s secretary\n\nGustaf Horn, field marshal, age 38, cavalry\n\nJohan Banér, age 35, general\n\nÅke Tott, age 32, major general with the cavalry\n\nLennart Torstenson, age 27, artillery\n\nFredrik Stenbock, age 23, with the Småland Regiment\n\nNils Brahe, age 26, Yellow Brigade\n\nErik Rålamb, age 20, chamberlain\n\nThe Miller, later a driver [in the baggage train], Lutheran\n\nThe Miller’s Wife, Catholic\n\nThe Bailiff, a Jew from Wolgast, later the leader of the fire brigade\n\nHis Assistants\n\nThe Sergeant Major, formerly a student in Uppsala, from Västergötland\n\nThe Quartermaster, Zwinglian, from Småland\n\nThe Provost, a gypsy, pagan\n\nThe Schoolmaster, a former soldier, from Östergötland\n\nFinnish Ensign in the Swedish army named Axel Eriksson Sparre, son of Erik Sparre, who was executed in 1600 under the rule of Karl IX\n\nDanish Ensign\n\nThe Cooper\n\nHis wife\n\nLuise, their daughter\n\nRudolf, a student in Wittenberg, her cousin\n\nGovernor of Mecklenburg, acting for Wallenstein, age 70, Lutheran\n\nSchwarzenberg, minister for the Elector of Brandenburg, Catholic\n\nMarcus, representative of the Bank of Israel in Hamburg, Jewish\n\nGustav Gustafsson, Gustav Adolf’s son with Margareta Cabiljau, a student in Wittenberg and Rector illustris, 15 years old\n\nHrasan, the Jews’ reader for worship services\n\nGeorg Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg, Gustav Adolf’s brother-in-law, Calvinist\n\nJohan Georg, Elector of Sachsen.

The basis for that edition was Strindberg’s original manuscript, which is held in Stockholm’s Nordiska Museet.\n\nLanding on the German coast.\n\nAct One\n\nThe shore of Usedom. Oak forest, ancient, in the sunlight; grass and flowers under the trees. geraniums, elder-flowered orchids, lungwort, woundwort, etc. Through the woods a stripe of sea, light blue, is visible. Above, towering clouds in fantastic shapes.\n\nTo the right, a dilapidated cloister that’s now a watermill. Outside the gate is a long table with benches under white and lavender lilacs. Behind the corner of the building, a large water wheel and dam with a bridge at the sluice are visible; bulrushes and water lilies border the millrace. The watermill isn’t operating, and only the murmur of the water is heard. In the middle of the stage there is a covered image of the Madonna.\n\nThe Miller’s Wife approaches the Madonna with a lighted candle that she sets in a tube affixed to the fence; crosses herself and kneels. The Miller enters, stands still and waits. The Miller’s Wife rises.\n\nMILLER: I didn’t mean to intrude.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: I know, my dear. In the twelve years since we wed, even while war rages, we’ve kept peace in our home. You with your Lutheran views and me with my Catholic faith.\n\nMILLER: My mother taught me that we should let each be happy in his own faith.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: So they say. But when you’re crammed together to say grace over the last crust of bread, keeping the peace is hard.\n\nMILLER: Listen. It’s Midsummer Day, the sun is shining and we should celebrate with our friends. But there’s nothing to put on the table. The mill wheel has been still for a year, waiting for something to grind—because no grain will grow where Wallenstein’s horses have trampled. And they’ve been trampling for twelve long years. The millrace is overgrown and the only thing we’re getting out of it are a few flowers. Our son’s at war, and our daughter . . . Well, it’s better to stay silent.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: What are you getting at?\n\nMILLER: I wish I knew. — To get away from this endless misery!\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Where would we go? Pomerania has been ruined, Mecklenburg has been ravaged, Brandenburg is desolate. Where could we go?\n\nMILLER: To war with everyone else. Better to plunder than to be plundered.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: That’s not true! Better to eat acorns with the beasts than steal a steak for yourself. We have to take the bad days alongside the good.\n\nMILLER: So they say! — How did you take the “bad day” when the Croatians tossed your daughter over a horse and rode off? You took it so poorly you had be taken to the madhouse in Wolgast—\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Hush, hush, hush. That was God’s punishment for my sins, that I should walk through the valley of death and see what I had never imagined. Perhaps it was also a consolation—that memory became dull, that the bitterness couldn’t take hold.\n\nMILLER (looks toward the back of the stage): There’s rustling in the brush and the crunch of pebbles. (lies down and puts his ear to the ground) — hoof beats and the clang of weapons. Evil has arrived, dear. Worse than the year the Croatians murdered so many people upstream that the waterfall ran red and the big wheel whipped blood as if it were the autumn slaughter. Do you remember the body that got caught in the paddles and flopped up and down, up and down… I can still see it, and the axle still bears the mark. They say that’s why the water lilies are red this year, and why the eels in the pond are fatter than ever before, but no one dares eat them. Because they smell like a corpse and are blue as a dead man.\n\nThree acorn pickers, gaunt and ragged, enter. They gather acorns from under the oaks and put them in bags.\n\nIt’s the acorn pickers, the only birds around this year. The starlings never came, the nutcrackers are nowhere to be found. No swallows are building under the eaves, no rooks or wild doves in the fallow fields, where only thistles and thorns will grow. There are no pike jumping in the reeds—no perch in the rocky shallows. The fish in the stream and the brook have wandered out to sea, scared off by the gunshots and the thundering cannons. Ah, my country. My poor German country. What have we done to deserve this suffering?\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: We have sinned.\n\nMILLER: Which we? Hasn’t it hit both the bad and the good, Lutherans and Catholics, the emperor’s subjects and the elector’s? — Tilly even quarters his men and demands funds from his own Catholics. And Wallenstein, that rotten Friedlander, plunders Mecklenburg, his own lands. It’s the chaos of Babylon, a flood of sin, the last days. (Pause; he listens.) See, over there: the horsemen of the Apocalypse!\n\nA Bavarian cavalry officer, named Kronberger, rides in, in the background, from the left; the horse is black, with a black saddle that has silver trim. The officer is in black armor with a white skull on top of the closed helmet. He has a lance with a small white banner. He rides slowly and looks out to sea; stops in the middle of the background; opens his visor and looks out at the sea again; lowers the visor and rides out to the right.\n\nMILLER (and his wife have hidden behind the Madonna): Death’s scout? Who’s coming next? — A Croat?\n\nA Croat enters on a horse from left; knapsacks, dead geese and chickens, clothing, a basket, etc., hang behind him. He follows the Bavarian officer and looks straight ahead as he goes. The acorn pickers follow the Croat and can be seen picking something up.\n\nMILLER: See, the crows follow the sower! And the sower is the horse — ah, God, to be horse these days!\n\nBeggars and marauders enter, follow the others, silent and stealthy.\n\nMILLER: The rear attachment: misery, hunger, theft, vice. All the vices. And shame. — All for the sake of honor, and for virtue and religion.\n\nTwo Walloons enter on foot, climb the hill, and stand looking out to sea.\n\nMILLER: Tilly’s Walloons. And what are they looking for? Those clouds out over the sea mean thunderstorms. But those people don’t fear the thunder of the heavens or the fires of hell!\n\nThe Walloons rush out.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Evil is among us.\n\nMILLER: New evil. Is there any evil that isn’t old? A new crime, a new vice — it would take a genius to invent one.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Don’t blaspheme! Surely you noticed that in our fortunate days misfortune stood just behind the door. And that in our time of need, help sat by the fire and waited — (ecstatic) — Look to the north: the golden clouds don’t bring thunder, because behind those clouds the sun will rise. Out of the north the unweary Gideon will come, because the Spirit of the Lord resides in the northlands.\n\nMILLER: Where’d you get that? A cuckoo heard from the north sings of sorrow. The Danish Kristian IV barreled down from the north to help us, so they said, but he was so soundly defeated at Lutter by Tserclaes Tilly that we’ve had it seven times worse since.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Further north, further north!\n\nMILLER: Up where the Swedes live? They’ve been talking about them since they were down ravaging Polish Prussia, but they’re staying politely at home . . .\n\nMILLER’S WIFE (looks out to sea and shades her eyes with a hand): Believe me, believe me — I see crosses in the sky. One cross, four crosses, five, eight, nine, so many no one can count. And they’re like yellow rye. And then I see white gulls as big as ships. And the good blond man stands in the prow and waves his hand in blessing over the waters and the lands. I can’t see if he walks on the water, but thousands of people stand on the shores to greet the great blond man: Blessèd is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n\nMILLER: Where do you see all that?\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: In my eyes, when I lift them to the clouds.\n\nMILLER: So you’re seeing a vision, while I see nothing. — Well, I do see the bailiff from Wolgast riding with his assistant in front of him. (Looking left.) Go in, dear. This will probably be unpleasant.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: He’s a dark man, the bailiff. But after him will come the blond one. (Goes in the house.)\n\n***\n\nThe bailiff rides in on an ass, which is led by an assistant.\n\nBAILIFF (dismounting): God’s peace, Martin Miller.\n\nMILLER: God bless you, bailiff. Please sit down.\n\nBailiff sits at the table; thinks for a while.\n\nMILLER: Is it bad news or good news?\n\nBAILIFF (quickly): Martin, have you heard about the Edict of Restitution?\n\nMILLER: Edict of Rest-i-tu-tion? Must have.\n\nBAILIFF: Restitute, hoc est: to restore, to return to the original owner. Well then: when the Protestant movement began to spread here in northern Germany, the Lutherans confiscated all church properties, including the cloisters, which they said had no owners, or were res nullius. Among those was this Cistercian cloister, which you purchased and converted to a mill. (Pulls out a document.) Based on this edict, in my capacity as confiscator imperii, I am required to declare your property restored. Thus it is taken from you.\n\nMILLER: Now the emperor uses religion to seize property?\n\nBAILIFF: Just like the Protestants when they stole the church’s silver and its cloister properties under the guise of faith.\n\nMILLER: Yes, with the approval of the religious Peace of Augsburg.\n\nBAILIFF: And nullified by the Battle of White Mountain. You see: it all comes around. What’s wrongly taken is easily lost. You bought stolen property, and now you’ve lost it.\n\nMILLER: Will it be a cloister again?\n\nBAILIFF: No. It will be a storehouse for the emperor’s troops.\n\nMILLER: One question. Are you Catholic?\n\nBAILIFF: That kind of question is no longer asked, and for good reason. The hundred-year religious struggles were settled, and we learned to live side by side with Christian tolerance. Why do you want to raise the double-edged sword of conflict between us?\n\nMILLER: I don’t want to—\n\nBAILIFF: Well, then, you don’t need to know my faith. — On to other matters: Have you seen that cloud over the sea?\n\nMILLER: Yes, of course.\n\nBAILIFF: Some say it’s gunpowder vapor, others that it’s a thundercloud. We’ve heard thunder, seen lightning, and old women say they’ve seen signs—you know…\n\nMILLER: My wife was just saying something like that. What do you believe?\n\nBAILIFF: I don’t dare believe, but I hope—hope the great war will end, our fields will be planted again, and our children will experience better times.\n\nMILLER: Our children. My children, who are lost out in the world, who I expected to welcome home again. But our home isn’t mine anymore. To tell you the truth, I have nothing left to hope for. And my wife—she won’t get through it.\n\nBAILIFF: Martin, if you knew what I and my family have survived—if only you knew! (stands, orders his assistant) Post the notice!\n\nAssistant pastes a paper on the Miller’s door.\n\nBAILIFF: Move your belongings before the executors come.\n\nMILLER: Where? I can’t manage it alone, and my wife is ill. She’ll get worse. And if I drag my belongings outside, the Croats will come.\n\nBAILIFF: What’s the matter with your wife?\n\nMILLER (his wife appears on the stairs; points to his forehead): Shh!\n\nBAILIFF: My errand is done. Don’t be angry with me. I’ve only done my duty. (Pause.) Did you know this is a festival day? No? Yes, in Wolgast they’re celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the Augsburg Confession, which gave freedom to the Protestants.\n\nMILLER: Freedom?\n\nBAILIFF: Yes! — Come to the festival. It will distract you. Strengthen your courage and your faith.\n\nMILLER: Thanks very much, but since my wife can’t come along—because she’s Catholic—I’ll stay away.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE (looking at the notice): What does it say?\n\nMILLER: It says: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessèd be the name of the Lord. — In other words: we’ve lost it all.\n\nMiller’s Wife falls down, unconscious.\n\nMILLER: It was more than she could bear. — Help me!\n\nMiller and the Bailiff’s Assistant move toward the Miller’s Wife.\n\nBAILIFF (calmly): Is she dead?\n\nMILLER: No! But why are you standing there like a dead man?\n\nBAILIFF: Because I’ve seen so much misery that I can’t suffer or even feel anymore.\n\nMILLER (sits on the bench): My God, you’re right. It makes no difference if she lies inside or out here. I believe I’d rather see her at the bottom of the sea, and me too. It’s strange. I’m almost happy—that it’s come to this.\n\nWalloons run through the background.\n\nMILLER: Why are they running?\n\nBAILIFF: I’ve been asking myself the same thing all day. Something’s happening in the distance. We don’t know what, but these carrion birds smell it. Aren’t you going to help your wife?\n\nMILLER: No. I can’t lift a finger, even if my heart were breaking. Misfortune has paralyzed me and I’ll never see another happy day. But I can’t cry either. — There lies the bride of my youth, the only woman to own my heart—my son at war, my daughter raped. Imagine: raped. Oh, my wretched country, what have you done?\n\nBAILIFF: A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\n\nMILLER: Yeah! That’s what they say.\n\nASSISTANT (to the Bailiff): Look, sir—the mirage over the sea.\n\nThey look at the cloud hanging over the sea, which has taken the shape of an old city with towers, gables, battlements, and spires, but in shadows of the clouds’ colors.\n\nBAILIFF (to the Miller): What’s this?\n\nMILLER (without turning around): It’s a specter, maybe a mirage. People say it’s Vineta, the city that sunk to the seabed after being plundered by the Danes and Swedes.\n\nBAILIFF: Was it out there?\n\nMILLER: On the island of Wollin. Its inhabitants were avowed haters of Christ. That’s all I know.\n\nSmoke rolls out of the mill building.\n\nASSISTANT: The mill is burning! For Christ’s sake, put it out!\n\nBAILIFF: Open the millrace, Miller, and get the water going!\n\nMILLER: Why bother?\n\nBAILIFF: Save your belongings, man!\n\nMILLER: Nah. They’d just be taken by the Walloons, those murdering arsonists.\n\nASSISTANT: Look, Bailiff! It’s haunted out there again. See—crosses. The golden cross!\n\nIn the mirage a large number of masts with flags are now visible; the yellow cross on a blue background.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE (wakes up and rises): Vineta has sunk and its heathen houses have toppled in front of the symbol of the cross. The Gold King is here, the savior has come. Blessèd is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna!\n\nBAILIFF (to the Miller): What’s she going on about?\n\nMILLER: Since she lost her mind, she claims her soul wanders while her body lies as if dead. — Which may be true, but something has happened out there\n\nNoise offstage.\n\nVOICE: The Swedes are coming!\n\nANOTHER VOICE: The Swedes are coming!\n\nBAILIFF: The Swedes are coming!\n\nMILLER: The Swedes are coming!\n\nWalloons run from left to right, followed by the acorn pickers and the marauders.\n\nBAILIFF: Take care then, Martin. I’m going back to town to get more information.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: Why is there smoke in the mill?\n\nMILLER: Because it’s burning, and it’s burning because the Walloons torched it. — Let the emperor’s house burn. It will be a midsummer fire to guide the Swedes! — See, the rats are fleeing the burning house. Come, dear, we’ll do the same. Out into the wide world.\n\nNow the blue and yellow flags are more apparent and under them the uppermost sails.\n\nASSISTANT II: Bailiff, sir!\n\nBAILIFF: Spit it out.\n\nASSISTANT II: The Swedes landed this morning. They set up camp, and now they’re here.\n\nBAILIFF: And the imperial forces?\n\nASSISTANT II: They’re withdrawing. Without resistance.\n\nBAILIFF: Unbelievable. But everything’s off kilter in this war—no one knows who’s a friend and who’s an enemy. What do our people say?\n\nASSISTANT II: They’re celebrating the arrival of our liberators.\n\nPeople—farmers and city people—have gathered on stage.\n\nBAILIFF (to the people): The mill is burning. Put out the fire! Put out the fire!\n\nSome of the people rush into the mill, and the smoke gradually stops.\n\nBAILIFF (to the Miller): The sun has come out from behind the clouds. Now you can ignore the emperor and settle down under your own roof again. Such is life, Martin.\n\nMiller goes up to the sluice; opens the millrace. Miller’s Wife goes out left.\n\nMILLER (Miller comes down from the sluice, over to the Bailiff): Is it right that we pay taxes to the emperor?\n\nBAILIFF: Pharisee! — Render unto God the things that are God’s; the emperor will always get what’s rightly his.\n\nMILLER: Whose friend are you?\n\nBAILIFF: I am a friend to Cato and Plato—but preferably to justice.\n\n***\n\nA Swedish herald enters, preceded by three trumpeters and three drummers; followed by the Quartermaster and the Sergeant Major.\n\nBAILIFF: Aha! Now we’ll get some real information.\n\nThe trumpeters blow a fanfare and the drummers drum; the people gather around them.\n\nHERALD (reads from a proclamation): “Gustavo’s Adolphus Rex, King of the Swedes, etc., hereby declares and proclaims to all the people of the German nations and the evangelical confession that he has landed in Pomerania as a friend and protector to save those who share our faith from the papists’ intolerable oppression and to secure freedom of conscience for believers in the pure Lutheran doctrine. And we assure the nation’s citizens that they will maintain their individual and property rights, urging that anyone caught stealing, plundering, or extorting others should be reported to the commanding officer so that he may be remanded for the appropriate penalty without delay.\n\nIssued in Wolgast at Our Headquarters,\n\nGustavus, as above.”\n\nTrumpets and drums. The Herald goes out; Sergeant Major and Quartermaster move about, sizing up the area.\n\nBAILIFF (to the Miller): Well-ll?\n\nMILLER (scratching his head): Yes. That’s good, very good… but—\n\nBAILIFF: Didn’t you hear the sour note? Your wife’s a papist. So the Swedes have come to defend you against her.\n\nMILLER: I would have liked it to be a bit different — — — but one must be accepting, accepting.\n\n***\n\nQUARTERMASTER (reading the notice on the mill door): Is this the emperor’s mill?\n\nBAILIFF: Nope.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Belongs to the papists, according to this notice. (to the Sergeant) This will be a suitable accommodation for the generals. Make a note.\n\nBAILIFF: Excuse me, sir, but has the foreigner come as a friend this time?\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (blustering): Stranger? The Swedish king is no stranger to this country. The Elector of Brandenburg is his brother-in-law, as the Prince of Sibenbürgen, Gabriel Bethlen, once was. The Elector of the Palatinate is his kinsman, as are the Dukes of Mecklenburg, Lauenburg, and Holstein, and he’s related to the Landgrave of Hesse as well. And take note that his nephew King Sigismund of Poland makes the King of Sweden a relation to Emperor Ferdinand II himself. Furthermore, my king is a German prince in the general government of Prussia in its main settlements of Braunsberg, Elbing, Pillau, and Memel. So not really a stranger after all, is he? Eh?\n\nBAILIFF: A hearty welcome then, gentlemen, to your kindred country. Hope the trip over was good.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Good enough.\n\nBAILIFF: I present myself as the Bailiff of Wolgast and commend these well-intentioned people for your best consideration.\n\nSwedish soldiers and baggage train people come in; put up tents, set up stalls, make fires equipped with cooking gear; set up field forges, a shoeing stall, move in tables and benches, etc. It has darkened over the sea; the rustle of trees and waves are heard.\n\nBAILIFF (to the Miller): Now your mill is gone again, at least for now, but this is the surest way to get it back.\n\nMILLER: Dreams! No, now I’d rather enlist and prowl the kingdom instead of sitting here in an empty mill while the water flows in vain. — The kettles are in the camps and if you’re on the rolls, you know you’ll always get fed.\n\nSwedish banners are placed at the doors, where guards are also posted.\n\nBAILIFF: Good luck, Martin. A new tide has come—terrible for some, good for others. Good luck!\n\nGoes out with his assistants and the ass. Miller goes out right, pensive.\n\n***\n\nSergeant Major and Quartermaster sit at a table.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: That was a real — so-and-so — of a trip (shouldn’t curse in the service). Three weeks of bucking the wind. Wouldn’t you say that’s a bad start? And then they ate all the provisions so we had to plunder Öland. That was a slimy move, and the people there aren’t too happy with us. — Well, now we’re here. But there’s nothing to eat, and I don’t even want to talk about drink (yawns and licks his mustache). No horses for the baggage train, not to mention a driver. The generals, who are expected to arrive any minute now, will have to sleep on empty flour sacks with empty stomachs. Phew! It takes a lot of religion for a campaign like this.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Good to have a little religion. And you could stand some more.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: And you could use a little humor. We didn’t come to convert redskins or baptize Turks.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: The Turk, my son, is in your heart. Seek him there and surely ye shall find him!\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: So you’re off the deep end then, old man?\n\nQUARTERMASTER: I’m not off any deep end, but I want to ask you a question, a life-changing question, young man. A question for your whole life: (accentuating each word) Do – you – know – what – makes – a – Christian (faster now) what he is? — No – you – do – not! — I’ll tell you! It’s election by grace.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (turns his back and moves upstage): Go home and curl up in a corner.\n\nQUARTERMASTER (without letting himself be disturbed): There are sectarians and proselytizers who argue that the Formula of Concord is binding for all nonconformists, but they forget one thing — What is that? — The last of the Lutheran confessions of the Reformation, given in our year of the Lord 1577 at the convention in Torgau—\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Shut your mouth!\n\nQUARTERMASTER: — Did I say Torgau? I meant—what was it again? Just a minute, I’ll remember. (Thinking and counting on his fingers.)\n\nDrummers beat the drums. Sergeant Major sits at a table; takes paper and a writing implement from a bag. A group of women (soldiers’ wives) gather on stage.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Quiet with those drums! — Provost, come here!\n\nProvost enters.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (proclaims): Inasmuch as a camp will now be formed, and insofar as according to the articles of war no loose women may be allowed near it, only the wives of soldiers, the commanding general has ordered that every woman who can’t prove with a certificate of marriage her legal union with an active-duty foot soldier, cavalryman, or baggage worker will be driven off.\n\nAre your papers ready, women?\n\nThe women approach the table and show their soiled papers.\n\nWOMAN I: Kind and gracious sir—\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (speaks quickly): Shut up until I ask a question! (looking at the paper) Anna Magreta… I couldn’t care less about that: Who are you married to? Småland cavalry officer number 246. — Provost! Look at the rolls for the Småland cavalry: number 246.\n\nPROVOST (reading): Småland cavalry officer number 246. Married.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Go, woman. You can wash up in the mess hall. March!\n\nWoman I goes.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (shouting): Number two!\n\nWOMAN II: Kind sir… it’s number 68…\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (shouting): You’re going to correct me?! When I say number two, you are number two. Your husband, however, may be number 68. Let me see — Småland cavalry number 68! Provost, look at the rolls for the Småland cavalry. Number 68.\n\nPROVOST (reading): Småland’s cavalry number 68. — Vacant.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Vacant? — Is he dead?\n\nPROVOST: He’s dead.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: So, you hussy. Do you think this is a marriage mart? Have you gone to war to capture a husband? Do you think there’s any military support for widows or orphans here? Out. Out. Out! — — —\n\nWOMAN II: He’s not dead! He’s not dead!\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: If he took off, then we’ll hang him as a deserter. So his place will be vacant anyway. Out, woman! — Provost, take the woman away.\n\nQuartermaster! —\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Yes, well — that was almost like the Marburg Colloquy.\n\nProvost takes the woman out.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: God save the king! But it’s a real nuisance that they drag their women along with the baggage.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Paul says: It is better to marry than to burn.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: As if marriage isn’t burning. Will you just take the women with you and distribute the food over there? Soon the generals will be here, and by then the camp should be as polished as a parlor floor.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: You know what, son. I’ve made a covenant with my eyes—woman born of woman is a firebrand from hell.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Take the Provost with you. He’ll come with switches and scorpions if you can’t trust your flesh.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: My flesh? — Shame on you. — Follow me, women! (Goes, accompanied by the women.)\n\n***\n\nSCHOOLMASTER (an old soldier with a wooden leg, glasses, and a cane, enters): God save you, sergeant.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: God save you, Old Powder. — What do you need?\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: I’m trying to find a place for my boys.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Is there such a rush for your abracadabra? Give the boys a day off from school and let them throw stones on the shore. But if they holler you’ll have to wring their necks. It’s supposed to be quiet—the generals are coming here to sleep.\n\nIn the background Scotsmen have entered, dancing after a bagpipe; in the middle of the stage is a Swedish fiddler.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: God save the king, but does the Sergeant Major know why women and children must be along for the war?\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Because there’s nothing to eat at home, I suppose.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: Is there anything to eat here?! I haven’t even seen a cookie crumb yet.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Please keep your thoughts to yourself. And don’t be conspiring or you’ll hang from a tree until your flesh hangs off your rotted bones. Do you understand? (stands.)\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: So. That’s how you treat a source of knowledge, a forest of forests, a hortus deliciarum, whose only goal is to be a servus servorum eruditorum…\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Abracadabra, abracadabra, abracadabra, ortus meretricorum, in secula seculorum. Eistenueian panton ton filon; kai hapanton, kai panton proserkomenin filo. Do you know what that was?\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: It’s Finnish.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: No. It’s Greek… I spent five semester in Uppsala as liber studiosus. Drank and fought, got drafted—and now I’m here. So, source of knowledge, just follow the road to the forest of forests.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: Joshev beseter äljon.[1] Do you follow?\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Hassur tamin påålo.[2] — Got one for that? — Go to the quartermaster and abracadabra with him. Here come the bigwigs.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER (going): A nice midsummer day this is.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: You probably wanted to dance around the midsummer pole.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: You’re mocking my misfortune. You know it was my honor to lose a limb in battle.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: During your retreat from the tavern after a binge you fell into a ditch and broke your leg. That’s what the records say. That’s why you have to sleep like a rooster now—on one bony leg—you old boozer. Salaam alaikum!\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: So charming. — Ass. (exits.)\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Fool!\n\n***\n\nFinnish Ensign enters with a Danish Ensign.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (in a Finnish accent, yelling): Can you just imagine…\n\nDANISH ENSIGN (in a Danish accent): I spent a lot of money. But I don’t think my wife will bawl me out.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Still, can you imagine…\n\nDANISH ENSIGN: Where did we stop?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: I can’t tell you that now.\n\nDANISH ENSIGN: You won’t outsmart me, devil take you!\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Well, well, well, well. (Trumpet signals from around the stage.) Oof, they’re already sounding the call to bed down for the night.\n\nDANISH ENSIGN: So what? Why not find some more fun tonight?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Well, I don’t want to dance to that bagpipe like the Scots. And they should have given that fiddler the boot on a holy night when we shouldn’t have to suffer any shenanigans in camp. Ah, I’d like to be home. Away from all this papistry. Sure, they’ve had their fun with me. But by god, if I make it home, I’m planting myself there.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (has stood and given a signal that the Scots and the fiddle player should be quiet. Now he approaches the ensigns.): Ensigns shouldn’t be so loud! The generals are on their way.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: So? I don’t know any generals.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: You’re about to. Attention!\n\nTrumpet fanfares. There is silence on stage; all stand up and look to the left. The Sergeant Major and the Ensigns stand hidden behind a tree so they can’t be seen by the Generals. The march begins, from stage left to stage right, and then into the mill, where the honor guard stands.\n\nGustaf Horn first, dressed for mourning; shortly after, he’s followed by Nils Brahe.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (to the Ensigns): Gustaf Horn. Son of Karl Henriksson Horn.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Horn of Kankas, the Finn? Can you imagine…\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Yep, but do your imagining a little more quietly. Karl Henriksson was condemned to death by Karl IX at the bloodbath in Linköping, but he was pardoned.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Whew. That was a bloodbath.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Nils Brahe. — Son of Abraham Brahe, who was the judge at the Linköping bloodbath.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Yes! And a nephew or cousin of Ebbe Brahe.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Shhhhh!\n\nJohan Banér.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Johan Banér.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: That must be the king.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Nope. But he’s a lot like him. — Son of Kristina Sture and Gustav Banér, who was beheaded at the Linköping bloodbath.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Can you just imagine! —\n\nFredrik Stenbock.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Fredrik Stenbock. Grandson of Malin Sture and Erik Stenbock, Gustav Vasa’s brother-in-law; pardoned at Linköping.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Oh, no kidding. Vasas and Stures.\n\nLennart Torstenson.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Lennart Torstenson, son of the traitor Torsten Lennartsson, who went to Poland with Sigismund.\n\nErik Soop.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Erik Soop of the Västergötland cavalry—saved the king’s life at Weissenburg.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Never in my whole life…\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Shh. — Karl Hård of the Västergötarne, with Axel Lillie of the Österbottningarne.\n\nKarl Hård. Axel Lillie.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: The one coming next, you must know him? Torsten Stålhandske, of the Finnish cavalry.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Nope. I don’t think so.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (holds him back): Quiet!\n\nTorsten Stålhandske.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Good Lord, it’s like all of Swedish history is marching out in front of God and everyone—\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Hold! More are coming. — Åke Tott, Erik XIV’s grandson. Vasa blood and the king’s cousin.\n\nÅke Tott.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: It’s all been fun and games until now, eh, my Danish friend? (Looks around and notices that the Danish Ensign disappeared.) That kiss-ass got away! It killed him to see these big shots because none of them are slippery Danes.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Ensign, it’s my duty to remind you that in the Swedish camp we do not insult other nationalities — not even Jews or Gypsies. — That’s our king’s command, and we must respect it.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Well, they’re definitely not as prejudiced here as I’m used to. What about the emperor’s people?\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: The emperor’s people have no nationality.\n\nErik Rålamb enters; wearing black with two feathers in his hat: one white, one red.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: The king’s, or rather, the queen’s chamberlain, Rålamb. His uncle was beheaded in Kalmar by Duke Karl.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Then we can expect the king soon.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Of course, certainly.\n\n***\n\nÅKE TOTT (comes out of the mill, with his hat in his hand; irritated.): The devil himself couldn’t stay here! — Sergeant, what kind of quarters are you providing! It smells like a fire pit and it’s hot as hell.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: My lord, we have nothing else. We can’t help it that the Croats set fire to it before we got here.\n\nÅKE TOTT: At least set the table out here, and see to it that we get good wine.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: God help me, but there isn’t a crust of bread in the whole camp.\n\nÅKE TOTT: Get out there and forage then!\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: My lord, that means we’d be taking it from the people. But, first, there’s nothing to take. The emperor’s troops have plundered the country. And second—\n\nÅKE TOTT: And, third, you’ll ride the wooden horse[3] if you let your officers go without food. You and the quartermaster. And, fourth, the king will be here soon for his dinner.\n\n***\n\nJOHAN BANÉR (comes out of the mill, bare-headed): I’ve slept in barns and pigsties, but I’ll be damned if I’ve been stuck anywhere like this. — Where’s the quartermaster?\n\nÅKE TOTT: He’s mustering the women, but we have the sergeant major here.\n\nJOHAN BANÉR: So then the sergeant can put up the tents out here.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: As you wish, but the king’s tent is supposed to go here, and the baggage hasn’t arrived.\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK (enters with his boots in his hands and throws them toward Tott.): Isn’t there some poor devil around to polish my boots?\n\nÅke Tott kicks the boots aside.\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK: You dare to kick my boots!\n\nÅKE TOTT: Come here and I’ll kick you! In a place you won’t soon forget!\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK: You’ll answer for that—[4]\n\nERIK RÅLAMB (comes out): My lords! The field marshal begs for peace and quiet. Not only has his son’s recent demise bowed him with grief, the difficult trip damaged his health. Peace, for God’s sake, peace.\n\nÅKE TOTT: That’s a fine thing to say to hungry people. I’m so hungry I could eat my tongue.\n\nERIK RÅLAMB: Is this new for you, Åke Tott, to face hardships in the field?\n\nÅKE TOTT: No, not when it’s necessary. But this is the negligence of the baggage people.\n\nJOHAN BANÉR: Damned carelessness.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: No, my lords, it’s not negligence—\n\nÅKE TOTT: Cut his throat if he talks back—\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK: I couldn’t give a damn about food. If I could just get my boots brushed—\n\nÅKE TOTT: Peacock!\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK: And what about you? Pig!\n\nERIK RÅLAMB: Fredrik, don’t bait Åke. He’s just a spoiled royal brat.\n\nJOHAN BANÉR: Hey, Åke, there’s some kind of festival in Wolgast. Let’s get our horses; we’ll ride in and pay for a little midsummer grazing.\n\nÅKE TOTT: What a brilliant solution to the food problem. Let’s go. (Hurries out, followed by Johan Banér.)\n\nFREDRIK STENBOCK (pulls on his boots and hurries after.): Wait a minute! — I’m coming! — Åke, man, wait! (Exits.)\n\nQUARTERMASTER (has come in; turns to the Sergeant Major): And they’re the Lord’s instruments on earth…\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Not all brooms are clean, and even fewer shovels.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (comes up to them): It’s just amazing to see the offspring and relatives of the executed lords coming together in one place.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: That’s proof of our great king’s noble and conciliatory nature. But at home in Stockholm, sit even more Linköping lords: Johan Sparre, the councilor, is the son of Erik Sparre, beheaded; Per Banér, secretary of the chancellery, is the son of True Banér, beheaded; Nils Bielke, councilor, is the beheaded True Bielke’s kinsman. Brutal Karl IX’s gentle son atones for his father’s sins. The quartermaster might call that satisfactio vicaria personalis, or vicarious personal reparation.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Me? No, far from it. That was Anselm of Canterbury and the heretic Abelard, who in opposing the nonconformists and semi-Pelagians wanted to establish, as in the letter to the Galatians—\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Stop! Stop there. I can’t believe I opened the spigot. — Now he’s really spouting. Let’s go, ensign. — Ah. Here comes a minister.\n\n***\n\nFabricius, the court chaplain, enters with Secretary Grubbe.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (to the Finnish ensign): Court Chaplain Fabricius and Secretary Lars Grubbe. The king must not be far away.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: No, but listen now—\n\nFabricius speaks quietly with Grubbe.\n\nGRUBBE (to Erik Rålamb): His Majesty is on the way. He requests that his tent be set up near the generals’ quarters.\n\nERIK RÅLAMB (to the Sergeant Major): Quick! His Majesty’s tent, here under the oaks.\n\nThe Sergeant Major and Quartermaster go out and come back with men who set up an open blue-and-yellow-striped tent roof between the trees. The evening has become darker.\n\nGRUBBE (to Erik Rålamb): His Majesty requests a meeting with Field Marshal Horn, General Torstenson, and Colonel Nils Brahe.\n\nErik Rålamb bows.\n\nGRUBBE: The trumpets will sound the call to rest for the night and Court Chaplain Fabricius will lead prayers—after which there should be silence. Severity with our own people and patience with the locals: that’s the king’s command.\n\nErik Rålamb goes into the mill.\n\nFabricius speaks quietly with Grubbe, then goes out, right. Adjutants come out of the mill and disperse to the right and left. Then the call to rest for the night is heard, on drums and trumpets, near and at a distance, all around. Grubbe sits at a table, takes up a writing instrument and writes.\n\n***\n\nGustaf Horn, Lennart Torstenson, and Nils Brahe come out of the mill, sit at a table under the king’s tent. Erik Rålamb comes out after the others; stands behind Horn. Grubbe stands and goes out to the right. Silence; the generals appear worried and embarrassed; they stare at each other for a while.\n\nHORN: Say something!\n\nTORSTENSON: What?\n\nBRAHE: In all truth, it will take the king’s unwavering confidence and firm faith to not be discouraged by such a poor start.\n\nTORSTENSON: I can’t deny that the locals’ conspicuous coldness is disheartening. Why aren’t they greeting their liberators with jubilation, instead of running off to hide?\n\nBRAHE: That could be explained by their fear of the emperor—maybe even a natural aversion to strangers. But what’s inexplicable is that we’ve landed without seeing so much as a single imperial soldier. Where’s the enemy? Where’s Conti? Where’s Tilly? And most importantly, where’s Wallenstein?\n\nTORSTENSON: No reports have come in to answer those questions. But we know one thing: the emperor’s troops are scattered around us, and in numbers considerably greater than ours.\n\nHORN: Don’t worry. When the king comes, he’ll untangle the knot. Where we see unrelenting darkness, he’ll see pure light—he was born in light and holds it within himself.\n\nRÅLAMB (excited): Well said, Gustaf Horn. I always think of the sun or of gold when I see my hero approaching—and the day I find a blemish on his pure, welcoming soul, I’ll stop believing in anything good.\n\nHORN: That will never happen, Erik Rålamb.\n\nRÅLAMB: But if I did—\n\nBRAHE: Be quiet. The king is coming.\n\nAll who were seated stand up and wait silently. The glow of torchlight is visible from the left. Then three torchbearers, then three guards. Finally the King.\n\nKING (in light yellow with a light blue sash; in his hat he has one white and one red plume, the queen’s (Hohenzollern) colors; in his hand he has dispatches that he throws on the table): Well! Now I’m here. — How are you? — So quiet! Have you had supper?\n\nHORN: No, Your Majesty.\n\nKING: Why not?\n\nHORN: Because there’s nothing to eat.\n\nKING: Then we’ll have to bed down hungry for once—and still be thankful for such a brilliant start.\n\nHORN: Brilliant?\n\nKING: Isn’t it amazing that we could execute our landing without the slightest opposition? Isn’t it an unequaled success that the enemy has withdrawn? I’m so pleased that—I’m afraid, afraid as always, that our good fortune won’t last long. — Does anyone know where Wallenstein is?\n\nHORN: No, but they say Tilly is somewhere to the west.\n\nKING (unrolling a map): Good. — Look at this map, at the red line. First I’ll take Stettin, which is the key to the Baltic and the road to Berlin . . . . Then I’ll take Frankfurt an der Oder, and separate my cousin Sigismund from Brandenburg, my dear brother-in-law. After that, Spandau will be a gift and I’ll have Magdeburg sewn up. — You look hesitant, Gustaf. You’re like my good Oxenstierna, who always sees the problems. He didn’t like this war, but when he couldn’t stop it, he gave in. — — — Why are you so quiet? Say something, Nils. Lennart… say something.\n\nTORSTENSON: Your Majesty, the enemy who doesn’t show himself is more dangerous that the one we can see—\n\nKING: That’s foolish talk, Lennart. I’ll leave you since you’re trying to strip me of my courage. Where is my friend Johan?\n\nBRAHE: Banér, Tott, and Stenbock rode into Wolgast to attend a festival, and find some delicacies.\n\nKING: No! That’s comical. I just came from that festival—there was nothing wet or dry around. Well, it was dry. They’re celebrating the centennial of the Augsburg Confession with fasting and prayers. And since the reformed church wasn’t part of the Treaty of Passau, the good folks of Wolgast were at each others’ throats. I’m imagining Åke and Johan with empty stomachs and parched throats listening to an eight-hour exegetical discourse! Ha! Yes, let them soak it up. — Go to bed now, friends; I’ll stay out here under the stars.\n\nHORN: And in the morning?\n\nKING: In the morning we’ll take Stettin! Erik Rålamb, stay with me and let the guards go rest.\n\nHORN (going into the mill): Good night, Your Majesty.\n\nKING: I wish you the same, Gustaf, and that your grief doesn’t interfere with your rest.\n\nBRAHE: Good night, Your Majesty.\n\nKING: Sleep well.\n\nTORSTENSON (to the king): God’s peace and blessings.\n\nKING: The Lord be with you, Lennart. Believe God is good, and peaceful sleep will come.\n\n***\n\nGuards and torchbearers leave at a sign from Rålamb. The foreground and the king are lit by the reflection of an offstage fire. In the background it’s murky and the seven brightest stars of Ursa Major [Karlavagnen/the Big Dipper], which have gradually appeared as dusk fell, are now visible. Crashing waves are heard in the distance.\n\nKING: Sit down, Erik.\n\nRålamb sits, his head is bare.\n\nKING: Can anyone hear us?\n\nRÅLAMB: No, Your Majesty. But someone can see us.\n\nKING: Who?\n\nRÅLAMB: The all-seeing one, above the stars.\n\nKING: Yes. May he look into my heart and see that my love for my fellow believers is as boundless as my hate for the papists. “I hate them with perfect hatred,” says David about the unjust.\n\nRÅLAMB: David lived under the law just as the papists do, but we live in faith under the Gospels.\n\nKING: So you mean I should love them? Love Richelieu, love Wallenstein? Never.\n\nRÅLAMB: Isn’t there a middle ground between love and hate? Can’t we tolerate them?\n\nKING: I can’t tolerate intolerance—so I hate the Catholics. You know, I can smell a Catholic within gunshot, and when I’ve had to shake one of their hands, it seemed as if I were taking hold of a snake. That’s why my position is so clear, my task so simple. That’s why I didn’t need a declaration of war, why I didn’t need allies—because sheep know their shepherd, and the shepherd knows the wolves. And he who isn’t with me is against me! — Where are you, Erik, my friend?\n\nRÅLAMB (on his knees): Here, at your feet, my hero and my king. And may my soul wither the day I fail you.\n\nKING: Yes, yes. You’re so young! — But if I fail, what then?\n\nRÅLAMB: Then I’ll turn my back on you, shatter my sword, and despise you forever.\n\nKING: You love me, Erik—do so always, whatever may happen. But get up now, someone is coming.\n\nRÅLAMB (kisses the king’s hand and rises): My leader and my God!\n\nThe king pulls his hand away.\n\n***\n\nMILLER’S WIFE (enters with an armful of willow branches in her apron and scatters them in her path as shoe approaches the king): “And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the earth. Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all inhabitants of the land.”\n\nRÅLAMB: So said Jeremiah, woman. But Isaiah says: “I have raised one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.”\n\nMILLER’S WIFE: He didn’t understand. — Jeremiah says: “For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah. And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me…” Blessèd is he who comes in the name of the Lord!\n\nKING (offers her his hand): Stand up, woman. Your faith is as warm as your hand. My brethren know me, as I know them. (to Rålamb) The first Protestant to welcome me. (to the woman) Peace be with you.\n\nMILLER’S WIFE (crossing herself as she goes): Et cum spiritu tuo. Amen. (exits)\n\nKING (gives Rålamb a startled look that transforms into a smile): What was that?\n\nRÅLAMB: I’m not sure. But I know she was a Catholic.\n\nKING: Who welcomes me…?\n\nRÅLAMB: A Pomeranian woman who’s been waiting for liberation from the Austrians. So? Wasn’t her hand warm? Well, so was her heart.\n\nKING: Don’t grin at me, Erik. I’ll get wiser with each passing day. — And forget that; it was just a mirage. (Goes upstage with his arm across Rålamb’s shoulders, stops, and stares out at sea.) See there? Ursa Major. That way is home—to where my little girl sleeps. (Blows a kiss.) Goodnight, my royal child. Goodnight, my queen. Goodnight, stars of home. (Comes back downstage; stops, with a worried look.)\n\nRÅLAMB: Majesty, you’re worried.\n\nKING: No. Do you know what your king is? — He’s hungry! — But now I’ll sleep off the hunger. You’ll read me to sleep out of the Good Book. (sits down facing the fire)\n\n***\n\nTrumpet signals in the distance; new signals move ever closer. Finally, drums begin to beat close by. The camp awakes and launches into urgent action. Horn, Brahe, Torstenson, and the other generals come out of the mill with belts and swords, which they put on.\n\nKING: Over there! What’s happening now?\n\nRÅLAMB: An alarm.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (enters quickly with torchbearers): The enemy is here! Now—Torstenson, Horn, Brahe! All of you: the Swedish watchword. Take it: God is with us.\n\nCurtain.\n\nAct Two\n\n1) In Stettin.\n\n2) In a peasant’s cottage outside Frankfurt an der Oder.\n\n3) In a camp outside Frankfurt an der Oder.\n\n4) In the palace park in Berlin.\n\n5) In the Spandau fortress.\n\nScene One\n\nA rich burgher’s home in Stettin. Dark, carved cabinets; tables with heavy cloths in saturated colors; chairs of the same style. At the back one large, open window that faces the harbor, where Swedish warships are moored, flags flying. On the back wall copper-engraved portraits of Luther, Melanchthon, and Gustav Adolf. To the left, a table is set for a birthday party with two candles, flowers, and several gifts set on a white tablecloth that is festooned with greenery and flowers.\n\nRudolf, a student from Wittenberg, and Luise, his cousin, by the window.\n\nRUDOLF (sticking a Swedish flag out the window): The emperor’s eagles have fled the golden crosses, and the Snow King brought a coolness to this stifling July heat.\n\nLUISE (hanging a wreath under Gustav Adolf’s picture): Hail, golden king, who opened our harbor so ships can come and go. Just think, Rudy, now I’ll get silk from France again so I can finish your sash.\n\nRUDOLF: Luise, I’ll wear my sash the day my friend Gustaf Gustafsson is awarded a rectorship at Wittenberg. Me, Luise—friend to Gustav Adolf’s son. Too bad he isn’t a prince.\n\nLUISE: But his father is the king.\n\nRUDOLF: His mother isn’t the queen, though. (quietly) Margareta Cabiljau, his beautiful mother, is married now, up north somewhere.\n\nLUISE: You shouldn’t have told me that. I don’t know why, but—it isn’t right to abandon a woman.\n\nRUDOLF: True. But the king’s own mother, the dowager queen, brought them together to save her son from his great and true love for a lady at court—called Brahe, I think.\n\nLUISE: Enough, please. Father’s coming soon with company and by then there should be wine at the table, (she takes out wine bottles and glasses and sets them on the table) joy in our hearts, and only happy thoughts.\n\nRUDOLF (indicates the portrait of Gustav Adolf): Light and light don’t make a picture, Luise—take away the shadows from that likeness and you’ll just see a white paper with some water stains that were hidden by the shading.\n\nLUISE: Is it philosophy you’re studying now?\n\nRUDOLF: And erotica.\n\nLUISE: What’s that?\n\nRUDOLF: That’s—women.\n\nLUISE: I don’t like your words or your manner, Rudolf. Times are evil when war is on, and people turn into animals. Watch yourself.\n\nRUDOLF: Listen, Luise. It’s your birthday, your seventeenth. The whole harbor’s full of flags—in your honor. The Swedish navy is saluting—in your honor. Luise, won’t you—\n\nLUISE: Shh, Mother’s coming.\n\n***\n\nMOTHER (enters with a duster; muttering to herself): I don’t like this.\n\nRUDOLF: What, auntie?\n\nMOTHER: I don’t like this at all. The gun smoke that destroys my curtains. The explosions and shooting that scare the life out of the sick. And the whole town’s full of drunken sailors and soldiers.\n\nRUDOLF: Aunt Gertrude, forget all of it and think about how important this day is for us, for Luise. Listen to me, for God’s sake. It’s your Luise’s birthday today, and I—your brother’s son—have come to visit for a while— (raises his voice, annoyed) —for as long as—. Let me finish—\n\nMOTHER: Hush! Father’s coming. And he has our guests with him.\n\nCOOPER (in a leather apron and with hoop iron in his belt rather happily enters with the Finnish Ensign, the Schoolmaster, and the Provost): Here’s my home! — And here are my new friends. My Swedish friends. And a Finnish ensign in the cavalry — what was your name?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: My name’s Axel Eriksson, but I don’t think I should just barge in like this.\n\nCOOPER: Erik Axelsson, of course! And this is the schoolmaster. Rudolf, he’s your kind.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: Field schoolmaster, if I may be precise—\n\nRudolf seems contemptuous.\n\nCOOPER (points to the provost): And this is the professor.\n\nPROVOST: No, my goodness—\n\nCOOPER: Hush now, and sit down for a glass of wine. My daughter, Luise, will serve.\n\nMother moves around disapprovingly, fussing with her duster; then she takes a towel and wipes the table between the guests. Luise reluctantly fills the wine glasses. Rudolf approaches the Provost suspiciously.\n\nCOOPER: A toast to the king! Take a knee!\n\nThree cannon shots outside. They drink as they kneel.\n\nALL (except Mother, Rudolf, and Luise): Hurrah!\n\nMother wipes between the glasses and looks annoyed.\n\nRUDOLF (to the Provost): Professor!\n\nPROVOST: No, I’m not a professor. I’m the provost. Provost!\n\nRUDOLF (signals Luise and they sneak away): What a crew.\n\nMOTHER: I don’t like this. Not at all!\n\nCOOPER (pouring more): Why are you wiping here? — And watch your tongue, Gertrude.\n\nMother exits.\n\nCOOPER (raising his glass): Friends, benefactors, and liberators! With those three words I share my heartfelt opinion. — My house is yours, and mine together, all I own… Put up your feet, Ensign. Make yourself at home, Professor.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (and the others make themselves too comfortable): How long ‘til that beautiful girl’ll be back?\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: In Latin: Puella! Beautiful women—the warrior’s reward.\n\nCOOPER (a bit awkward): I don’t follow…\n\nSCHOOLMASTER (drunk; knocks over a glass): Estisne preparati? — Sumus! — A cantilena! (sings and drums on the table)\n\nSum, sum, sum,\n\nDum, dum, dum,\n\nBum, bum, bum,\n\nTrum, trum, trum!\n\nJumps on his chair; sings a mournful melody and dances along.\n\nYoung Sverckling rode away [Där var unge Herr Sverckling\n\non a horse of gray. Han rider på hasten grå\n\nHe passed a hundred miles Så rider han over hundra mil\n\nBefore looking back in dismay. Innan han sig tillbaka såg.\n\nBetween mountain and dale Emellan berg och dala\n\nLie the dead warriors. Där ligga de krigsmän döda\n\nIn Sweden are their small children, Uti Sverige efter dem barnen små\n\nCrying for their food.[5] Som gråta fast efter sin föda.]\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Come on—who sings such sad songs around strangers?\n\nCOOPER (with stifled rage): Get off that chair.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: Watch yourself, Finn.\n\nCOOPER: Get off of that chair! I’m expecting company for my daughter’s birthday party.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: You have company, Cooper, and you won’t find any finer!\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Come now, schoolmaster, don’t be so rude.\n\nCOOPER: It’s upsetting, even painful you might say, to see a down-on-his-luck old man make such a fool of himself. Forgive me for saying so, gentlemen—\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: I suppose you could say it was bad luck that this scarecrow went on a bender and snapped his leg in two…\n\nSCHOOLMASTER: You dare to taunt me, but no dares touch me. — I dare you: touch the cripple. Touch the cripple! Touch!\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Just listen to the wretched old duffer. That’s my thanks for taking pity on you.\n\nSCHOOLMASTER (deliberately knocks over a glass with his crutch): It’s amusing how much one can teach with the sharp edge of whip!\n\nSum, sum, sum\n\nTrumm, trumm, trumm—\n\n***\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (enters, back straight, but drunk): Get off that chair, you scoundrel. — Are you the leader of the coopers’ guild?\n\nThe Schoolmaster moves away from the table.\n\nCOOPER: At your service, Sergeant. Did you forget something?\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: Yep. I forgot a glass—a couple of glasses—a couple of glasses of wine. Bonum vinum infelix gaudeamus!\n\nCOOPER: An amusing man. Please help yourself.\n\nThey drink.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR: I had another errand too, but that’s for the Quartermaster to handle. In good company, with a good glass — — — (empties his glass) I’d rather not darken the mood with unpleasant news. Life is short, and after death there’s no pleasure. Ergo bibamus. (depression [as in—he really brings down the mood of the room]) This is the bright side of war! Yes, sir, it is!\n\nQUARTERMASTER (enters): Why are you planted here getting drunk, Sergeant Major? And you, Ensign? Provost? And you, Schoolmaster? — Are you the leader of the cooper’s guild? Is this your house? Yes, well, then. (takes out a paper) May I sit?\n\nCOOPER: Sit down and have a drink in honor of the day, Quartermaster.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: No, a thousand times, no.\n\nCOOPER: Oh, let me tempt you!\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Tempt me? For me there are no temptations. See, here is a glass. (lifts a filled glass) Here is some lovely wine, and here are my lips. Here is my nose that smells the lovely wine. And so what? So—I do this. (Puts down his glass.) I have overcome the last temptation. But now, to the point. — According to the treaty reached between the Swedish king and the Duke of Pomerania, the city is obligated to accept Swedish garrison. And during the allocation of resources, the commanding general designated this house as the royal headquarters. Is that clear?\n\nCOOPER: A great honor, certainly, but a greater inconvenience. We were celebrating a birthday here today—\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Yap, yap, yap. All of you, go. Except the cooper.\n\nSERGEANT MAJOR (emptying his glass): This is the dark side of war. (Exits.)\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Then clean this room. All the knickknacks should be removed, and all traces of dissipation swept away.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (going out): Nooo, just listen…\n\nSCHOOLMASTER (going out): Sum, sum, sum! Preparati sumus. We are ready for everything — except death.\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Prepare for the gallows, you godless heathen. —\n\n***\n\nCOOPER (worried): So I’m being driven out of my own house?\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Using a loose translation of the term billeting, I suppose you could say that. But that’s the punishment for your sins. For over a hundred years you Protestants have been sinning without consequence. When Luther proclaimed that faith is everything and good deeds are nothing, you embraced faith like a mutt after a lump of sugar. But you abandoned good deeds. Thus your degradation has entered its final phase, and now He who will punish you with beatings and scorpions is coming—and only after that will He give you true freedom.\n\n***\n\nThe Fire Chief, formerly the Bailiff of Wolgast, followed by the Provost, who carries a bundle of pitch wreaths.\n\nQUARTERMASTER (to the Cooper): This is fire chief. Do your work, chief.\n\nCOOPER (to the Fire Chief): We’ve met before. Aren’t you the bailiff in Wolgast?\n\nFIRE CHIEF: I was.\n\nCOOPER: You were with the emperor—and now you’re with the king.\n\nFIRE CHIEF: Yep. I am what they make me. If they’re good to me, I’m good to them—and the opposite.\n\nCOOPER: Depending on how well you’re paid.\n\nFIRE CHIEF: Of course. — So, Cooper, pony up your fire tax. 500 gyllen, your share of the 50,000 riksdaler that the city of Stettin has committed to pay (rattles a money bag).\n\nCOOPER (in a fury): Fire tax?! Is the enemy upon us, or has the devil sent a false friend to drive us out of our homes and squeeze us for money?\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Oh, stop. A soldier doesn’t argue.\n\nCOOPER: I’m not a soldier, but I could sign up with the Croats! — Think about that number of years our city has defended itself against the emperor, enduring the siege with honor. And now the liberators arrive, friends who fool us into opening the city gates so they can plunder and burn. And for these swine I open my home and offer a drink of welcome. To hell with it. (throws a tray with wineglasses out of the window) And for this Turk I’ve hoisted the flag of another country. Traitor that I am. (unfastening the Swedish flag and throwing out the window) No! I am for emperor and fatherland, not foreigners and their foreign king. (turns Gustav Adolf’s portrait toward the wall) But this is what we get for our dissent, for rising up against our lawful lord. Poor Germany, if only you knew what you’ve done.\n\nFIRE CHIEF (quietly): Yell all you want, just pay up.\n\nCOOPER: Yes, I’ll yell: long live the emperor! I’d rather one honest enemy than fifteen thousand faithless friends.\n\nFIRE CHIEF: Provost! Get your pitch wreaths. — And what are they? Symbols of the risk the city was taking if it failed to pay.\n\nCOOPER: Arsonists!\n\nFIRE CHIEF: They’re just symbols.\n\n(The Cooper grabs the wreaths from the Provost.)\n\nQUARTERMASTER: Now you’ve crossed the line. Call for help. Guards!\n\n***\n\nRålamb enters, followed by Luise; Mother appears in the doorway.\n\nRÅLAMB (signals that everyone should leave): Leave the room. The King will be here soon.\n\nEveryone starts to go except Rålamb, Luise, and Mother.\n\nRÅLAMB (to the Cooper): There will be justice, and all offenders will be punished. We’ve already hanged one of our own who stole a farmer’s cow. As for the fire tax, it will support the troops and fortifications for the city. It was levied with the duke’s approval—\n\nCOOPER: His approval while facing your cannons with his heart in his throat…\n\nRÅLAMB: My friend, don’t say anything else. It may be that I… share your opinion. But I can’t really do that. So go before that happens.\n\nCOOPER: Finally, the words of a friend (going).\n\nRÅLAMB: Just go!\n\n***\n\nRÅLAMB (to Luise): My lovely child, the hard realities of war, the current state of need, the soldiers’ grumbling have forced us to these actions. It’s not the best people who go to war, but we’re not all the worst either. It pains me more than I can say—this intrusion into your family and disrupting your party. Especially since it’s yours, lovely girl.\n\nLUISE (starts to clear the birthday table): What do you know about me and what I deserve?\n\nMother moves around, disgruntled, wiping up.\n\nRÅLAMB: Miss Luise, let the table be. No one will desecrate this little altar of parental love for a cherished child. I will keep watch over it each night, and before the candles burn down your home will be yours again. Where virtue and beauty abide, nothing evil or ugly thrives.\n\nMOTHER: What are you talking about? Get a hold of feelings!\n\nRÅLAMB: My feelings, woman, are so distant, so lofty, that your thoughts couldn’t reach them. (He removes his hat and preens over the red and white feathers.)\n\nMartial music on the street below.\n\nRÅLAMB: Come out quickly. The King is here. (Leads Luise and Mother out.)\n\nMOTHER: I don’t like this. It’s not fair.\n\nLUISE: Mother, perhaps we must go through much tribulation to attain happiness.\n\nThe King enters. Rålamb stares out the window and turns his back.\n\nKING: Erik!\n\nRålamb sulks.\n\nKING: Are you still displeased with your king?\n\nRålamb keeps sulking.\n\nKING: Erik! You’re a spoiled child and you’re abusing the power my friendship gives you.\n\nRålamb turns to him.\n\nKING: You despise me?\n\nRÅLAMB: Yes. A thousand times, yes.\n\nKING: But I can’t just turn back because the soldiers have no means of support. And I won’t resort to plundering.\n\nRÅLAMB: What’s this fire tax, then? It’s “pay up, or I’ll burn down your house!” If that’s how you treat friends, fellow believers, what can the enemy expect?\n\nKING (takes his arm): Clearly you don’t understand. Be reasonable, or go out and cool off.\n\nRÅLAMB: No. I won’t leave this room until it is restored, intact, to the woman who owns it.\n\nKING: The woman who owns it? Ah, are you already unfaithful to your sweetheart?\n\nRÅLAMB (embarrassed): No, of course not.\n\nKING (seeing his reversed portrait): Who else has turned his back on me?\n\nRÅLAMB: Just someone pushed into a corner.\n\nKING (rights the portrait): Erik Rålamb, the day I get angry at you—and stay angry—I’ll be so thoroughly enraged that I fear the moment.\n\nRÅLAMB: Postpone that moment, for as long as possible. Be good to everyone, even the humblest, and always do what’s just and right—\n\nKING: I’m always just, and I have nothing to apologize for—\n\nRÅLAMB (takes the king’s hands and looks in his eyes): Oh God, you believe that. You believe that.\n\n***\n\nLars Grubbe enters.\n\nKING: So, Lars, what do you have?\n\nGRUBBE: To be succinct: the French ambassador is here again to offer you an alliance.\n\nKING (sits): Again! And he dares to try again after his latest offence against the Edict of Nantes, after the siege of La Rochelle with all its horrors—where our fellow believers were starved and slaughtered. Instruct him to return to his country and tell Cardinal Richelieu that the Swedes will eat the bark off Brandenburg’s pine trees before they’ll eat French bread from the hand of a heretic.\n\nGRUBBE: Your Majesty, may I offer a word?\n\nKING: Speak.\n\nGRUBBE: The ambassador has 400,000 riksdaler with him to assist with the first year—\n\nKING: And I hope he chokes on them. Did Kristian IV benefit from the Jesuit money he accepted? — The negotiations are over. What else do you have to say?\n\nGRUBBE: The Duke’s 50,000 riksdaler has been distributed as half-pay to the soldiers, but they still have nothing to eat.\n\nKING: What’s that? Lars, go out and look at the birds in the sky, and then come back and tell me who feeds them. That will give you a new perspective on the matter. What else do you have to report?\n\nGRUBBE: Letters and audiences.\n\nKING: Start with the letters.\n\nGRUBBE (takes out an opened letter from a bag): From the Elector of Brandenburg.\n\nKING: What does he say?\n\nGRUBBE: He will not grant you the right of passage, and he won’t release any of his fortresses.\n\nKING (opens a map): No right of passage to rescue Magdeburg? Not exactly a friendly gesture. Well. Then I’ll go and take Frankfurt an der Oder. And Brandenburg and I can talk about it later. — A red X on Frankfurt! — What does the Elector of Saxony say?\n\nGRUBBE: Three letters so far, and no response.\n\nKING: Good. Then he can come to me three times to ask for help before he gets it. His high-and-mighty self. — Who wants an audience?\n\nGRUBBE: The Governor of Mecklenburg, Wallenstein’s representative in the duchy.\n\nKING: No, Wallenstein’s representative? Finally? Let him in immediately.\n\nRÅLAMB: Your Majesty, he could be a Jesuit.\n\nKING: So what if he is? They’re people too, just like the Mohamedans, Jews, and heathens on my payroll. Go, Grubbe, and send him in right away. —\n\nGrubbe goes.\n\nRÅLAMB: Your Majesty—\n\nKING: Quiet, Erik. Don’t you see that God is with us? So who can be against us? I hate Jesuits as deeply as you do, but I fear them less. If you’re worried, then stay. — Either way, my guards are coming.\n\n***\n\nBANÉR (enters without noticing the king; somewhat noisy): Isn’t the old man here?\n\nKING: Do you mean me?\n\nBANÉR: Beg your pardon, Your Majesty. I mean Gustaf Horn; he’s only thirty-eight, but he’s the oldest. And so—\n\nTorstenson enters.\n\nKING: Yes, Johan, I know you’re a warrior, especially when you’ve been drinking. But learn a little diplomacy from Lennart and I’ll like you more.\n\nHorn enters.\n\nAnd a little wisdom from Gustaf Horn.\n\nBrahe enters.\n\nA little charm from Nils Brahe. — Come sit here, Nils. (The King indicates a place at the table for Brahe; goes himself to the open door and looks out.)\n\nBANÉR (to Brahe, under his breath): Watch yourself, Nils.\n\nBRAHE (Puzzled look.)\n\nBANÉR: His Majesty might drown… in sweet memories… of your cousin Ebba…\n\nBRAHE: Hush.\n\nKING (sits at the table): Places. — The Governor of Mecklenburg is here. Bring him in, Erik.\n\nRålamb goes out the door.\n\nKING: Sober up, Johan. This is a serious game.\n\nRÅLAMB (enters again, followed by the Governor): The Governor of Mecklenburg presents his respects to His Majesty, the King of Sweden.\n\nGovernor enters, bows, and looks around for a chair.\n\nKING (stays seated): Welcome, Governor.\n\nGOVERNOR: Your Grace.\n\nRÅLAMB: Say “Majesty.”\n\nGOVERNOR: Your Grace.\n\nKING (angry): Is it out of ignorance or spite that you don’t use my royal title?\n\nGOVERNOR: Neither. I speak and act only in accordance with orders of my prince, the Duke of Mecklenburg, Albrecht von Wallenstein.\n\nKING: And he denies me the royal title of Sweden.\n\nGOVERNOR: The Majesty of Sweden, King Sigismund Vasa, resides in Warsaw.\n\nKING (violently): What?\n\nBANÉR (slams his fist on the table): Watch yourself, Jesuit!\n\nKING (to Banér): Quiet, Banér! (to the Governor) Let me inform you that I was elected King, elected by the Estates.\n\nGOVERNOR: Ah. We believed Sweden ceased to be an elective monarchy when the great Gustav Vasa made it a hereditary monarchy in 1544.\n\nKING (to Horn): I can’t speak with this Jesuit.\n\nThe Governor moves a chair to sit in, but Banér pulls it away.\n\nKING: State your errand. Quickly. Tell us what your lord, the Duke, has planned. What he intends.\n\nGOVERNOR (smiles): He doesn’t share his plans.\n\nBRAHE (to the King): Your Majesty, don’t cross words with a papist. Let a sword do your talking.\n\nGOVERNOR: Why are you calling me a papist and a Jesuit when I’m neither?\n\nKING: What are you then?\n\nGOVERNOR: I’m a Lutheran.\n\nKING: Serving the Duke of Friedland, the emperor’s own Wallenstein?\n\nGOVERNOR: Yes! That’s how my lord is. Born a Protestant himself, he’s finally put all religious conflict behind him. Life has taught him to have tolerance for all beliefs. That you’re treating me like the enemy surprises me. My prince admires Your Grace, whom he even considers a friend.\n\nKING: Unbelievable.\n\nGOVERNOR: If I may have a chair, I’ll explain further.\n\nKING: Erik, give the governor a chair. He’s an old man, and we’re young.\n\nRålamb reluctantly offers the Governor a chair.\n\nGOVERNOR (sits, puts on eyeglasses, and sizes up the room): You gentlemen are really very young, which is not to say immature—\n\nHORN: No, now he’s gone too far!\n\nKING: Let the old man prattle. His insolence amuses me.\n\nGOVERNOR (to the King): Your Grace was the late Gabriel Bethlen’s brother-in-law? Right? The prince of Siebenbürgen was a vassal of the Turks, and two years ago Your Grace attempted alliances with the Turks and the Tartars. That wasn’t nice and it wasn’t good politics. Because regardless of what we believe, we Christians are obliged to band together against the heathen dogs.\n\nBRAHE (draws his sword): You—\n\nKING (to Brahe): Put that sword away, Nils!\n\nGOVERNOR: My prince, my hero, Albrecht von Wallenstein — (stands and bows) — takes the long view. So he’s made it his life’s work to unify Germany, which can happen only by eliminating princes and electors—and then throwing the Turks out of Europe, restoring Byzantium, and rebuilding the Eastern Roman Empire. That is the plan of an emperor, don’t you think?\n\nKING (involuntarily intrigued): A great plan, certainly.\n\nGOVERNOR: Thus the great Russian powerhouse is folded into Europe and Asia ceases to be a concern. — And to circle back to the beginning, the unification of Germany through the elimination of petty princes, Your Grace (bows) has already appeared as the Friedlander’s ally. I end this audience by offering my lord’s sympathy and best wishes for your continued success. (Stands and hands the chair back to Rålamb.)\n\nKING: No, sit down again and explain further.\n\nGOVERNOR: Impossible. Duke Bogislav is expecting me — (assesses the group, one by one) — You are Field Marshal Horn. General Banér. Colonel Torstenson of the artillery—only twenty-seven. (smiles) Colonel Brahe, always standing closest to the king. All of you the king’s relatives, more or less. All young and glorious men, full of faith and zeal and ambition and self-indulgence. Farewell, young men. The future is yours. If you learn to not underestimate your enemy. (He goes.)\n\n***\n\nKING: What was that? Who was that man who in a few minutes turned my thoughts upside down? Wallenstein’s governor is a Protestant?\n\nHORN: Yes, Your Majesty, just as his Friedlander generals Hebron and Pechman are Lutheran and half his army are unbelievers or Protestants.\n\nKING: So I’ll be fighting against fellow believers. But the object of the war was to protect them.\n\nHORN: Life’s contradictions won’t be solved by us mortals.\n\nBANÉR: Maybe not solved, but cut off! —\n\nKING: Wallenstein has greater plans than I. He sees unity in the distant future, where I only saw divisions. — And this archenemy, this antichrist, says he’s my friend? Can I be my enemy’s friend?\n\nTORSTENSON: This apparent contradiction was resolved by St. Paul when he said: “When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended… that he might fill all things.)” But, the apostle adds, “Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man… that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men… But… grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.”\n\nBANÉR: Thanks very much, Lennart, but I didn’t come to hear a lesson from St. Paul; I came to fight.\n\nBRAHE: I agree.\n\nKING: If I don’t exactly agree, it’s because my thoughts are going another direction. — I’ll try to follow them.\n\n***\n\nTOTT (enters quickly): Your Majesty, I come uninvited!\n\nKING: You always do, Åke Tott. Have a seat.\n\nTOTT: A refugee from Magdeburg says Falkenberg is surrounded and Tilly arrived to begin a siege.\n\nKING: That means everyone to his post so we can take Frankfurt an der Oder. Then Brandenburg will have to grant us a right of passage. To Magdeburg! (Gets up. All get up.)\n\nTOTT (setting a packet of letters on the table): But here’s a stack of past-due bills for Hamburg brought by the Jew.\n\nKING (putting the packet in his pocket): Good. My brother-in-law will take care of them—in Berlin.\n\nTOTT: And the Jew?\n\nKING: Bring the Jew along and feed him like a king. — “For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him,” so says St. Paul. Right, Lennart?\n\nTORSTENSON: But surely he means something else—\n\nKING: Surely. — Let’s go.\n\n***\n\nSTENBOCK (enters): Your Majesty, I’m too late.\n\nKING: You’re always too late, Stenbock, because you’re always fussing with your clothes. Spit it out.\n\nSTENBOCK: Your Majesty. The troops are disgruntled and are threatening mutiny.\n\nKING: Give the signal to march immediately, and their discontent will collapse like a weary horse.\n\nSTENBOCK: A hungry horse won’t carry his burden. And soldiers want butter on their bread.\n\nKING: They won’t get it. March! (goes toward the birthday table, where Rålamb has been standing most of the time) What are you guarding?\n\nRÅLAMB: Two young people’s heartfelt secrets; two old people’s hope and joy.\n\nKING: I understand. You’re a dreamer, a knight protecting virtue and honor. Go tell your wards that— that—. Oh, figure it out on your own. (Exits.)\n\nCurtain.\n\nScene Two\n\nA peasant’s cottage cluttered with captured flags, drums, weapons, and other war detritus; the King sits at a table with a map in front of him. Horn, Torstenson, Banér next to him; all appear worried and thoughtful.\n\nKING (uses chalk to draw on the map): I’ll put a red X through Frankfurt an der Oder; it’s taken. (to Horn) What do you think, old man?\n\nHorn silent, distressed.\n\nKING: He says nothing. — Well, Lennart. What does St. Paul say about this?\n\nTORSTENSON (hurt): Your Majesty.\n\nPounding on the door.\n\nKING: There, there. Come on now, forgive me. (to Banér) Johan, what would you do now in my place?\n\nBANÉR: Well, I’d rather not say.\n\nKING: Didn’t you send Rålamb up to the main house?\n\nBANÉR: Yes, I did, Your Majesty.\n\nPounding increases.\n\nKING: Yes, well. I sent him away so we can speak freely. That young man has so thoroughly won my affection that he guards my conscience like a jealous woman. Sometimes I’m afraid of him! (The king’s speech is met with silence.)\n\nHe’s a tyrant—why, I’m not sure, but that’s how it is.\n\nWhat’s that noise outside? Speak up, Johan. You’re the bravest.\n\nBANÉR: It’s the soldiers, of course. Dissatisfied because they haven’t gotten their pay—\n\nKING: It’s always the pay!\n\nHORN: And they’ve only had dry bread to eat for the last three days—\n\nKING: Provisions are expected from Hamburg any moment!\n\nHORN: They’ve turned back and gone to the enemy—to the emperor’s troops outside Magdeburg—because their bills weren’t paid.\n\nKING: What else haven’t you told me! — — — How’s my friend Marcus of Hamburg?\n\nHORN: He isn’t suffering—Tott is pampering him. But he isn’t satisfied. He’ll probably retaliate.\n\nBANÉR: And he’s joined forces with the Jewish fire chief from Wolgast and other Israelites. They claim that when there are ten of them, they’ll worship together—read the Torah, as they call it.\n\nKING: What’s the Torah? Do you know, Lennart?\n\nTORSTENSON: The Torah scrolls? They’re the first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch. It’s the same holy book as—\n\nKING: Not the Gospels. So they’re heathens. Surely I can’t allow them to worship. — All this noise, it’s making me ill. — Johan, go and find out what’s happening, and ask Fabricius to come.\n\nBanér exits.\n\n***\n\nKING: Friends, you know I feel like someone has dragged me by the hair somewhere I don’t want to be. Those cries out there, they’re not cries of distress or suffering, they’re the evil passions let loose by war. — I know where it will lead. I know I don’t want to go there, but I’m being dragged that direction nonetheless. (stands, upset) I’ve been on the battlefield for twenty years, but I never get used to the hateful smoke from gunpowder. It smells like the devil—the sulfur and saltpeter. And it makes people evil, as if it rises straight from hell to challenge heaven’s thunder. But it only brings showers of tears and blood instead of blessèd rain for the earth’s crops.\n\n***\n\nBANÉR (comes in with Marcus): Your Majesty, the Jew Marcus of Hamburg requests an audience.\n\nKING: What do you want, Marcus?\n\nMARCUS: Majesty, if I don’t report back to my superiors with—\n\nKING: You’ll get your money, but I need a deferment.\n\nMARCUS: More time? But I won’t get more time from—\n\nBanér goes out; noise increases.\n\nKING: And that’s why you retaliated by rerouting the supply train?\n\nMARCUS: Yes!\n\nKING: Do you think that’s fair?\n\nMARCUS: It’s justice. More just than cutting down two thousand of the emperor’s troops in Frankfurt because they had cut down four hundred Swedes in Neu-Brandenburg. And it’s better than taxing fellow believers!\n\nKING (to Horn): Should I take this?\n\nHORN (Silent.)\n\nKING (to Marcus): Go to my secretary, Grubbe, who handles the money—\n\nMARCUS: No, I won’t do that. I just came from the secretary and he sent me here—to the one who signed the notes.\n\nKING (sits): What would you ask for a thirty-day deferment?\n\nMARCUS: I don’t have the right to negotiate for what I don’t own.\n\nKING (fiercely): Do you think I’m trying to do something illicit?\n\nMARCUS: Yes, that’s exactly what I think.\n\nKING (controlling himself): Listen. I’ve heard that you and others want to hold worship services together—\n\nTorstenson makes a sudden, impatient movement and rattles his sword.\n\nKING: I certainly don’t want to confuse matters of faith with money concerns—\n\nMARCUS: And yet…\n\nHorn—violently agitated—quickly stands, surges toward the King, leans forward and whispers to him.\n\nMARCUS (in the pause): For a Christian everything’s a commodity, even freedom of faith. And while he’s a happy buyer, he’s a poor payer.\n\nKING: Field Marshal Horn offers his personal fortune as a guarantee for the amount due. Will that satisfy you, Marcus?\n\nBanér enters.\n\nMARCUS: The field marshal’s name is good. He owns fine lands. Offer accepted.\n\nKING: So gracious. —\n\nBANÉR (takes Marcus by the collar and shoves him out.): Out, devil. Out! (to the King) He got the troops all worked up.\n\nKING: What do the soldiers want now?\n\nBANÉR: To plunder.\n\nKING: I knew it. — Plunder my brother-in-law’s city, my wife’s countrymen? No. We’re not doing that.\n\nBANÉR: There’s no other way. The Scots are angry, the Irish are drunk, the Dutch and the Saxons are running around with fire — the whole army has gone crazy.\n\nKING: I’ll go talk to them. — But send for Fabricius.\n\nBANÉR: Don’t go out there, the storm is raging.\n\nKING: I’ll quiet it, then. Get Fabricius. — Stay here. (When the others start to follow him.) Stay! (Hurries out.)\n\n***\n\nHORN (to Banér): Why did he send for the pastor?\n\nTORSTENSON: He always does that when he plans to do something wrong.\n\nBANÉR: He’s like an endearing child or a gorgeous woman: everything flatters him, even his less becoming deeds.\n\nHORN: That’s why he’s been called—\n\nTORSTENSON: Even called to sin. Without sin he’d be self-righteous.\n\nBANÉR: I think a little sin becomes him. Otherwise he wouldn’t be human, he’d be too powerful, too superhuman.\n\nHORN (listening to what’s happening outside): But this won’t end well.\n\nBANÉR: Everything ends well for God’s golden boy.\n\nTORSTENSON: But this will end with him accepting French money.\n\nHORN: So let it. When our natural allies—Pomerania, Brandenburg, and the Saxons—don’t want to help—\n\nTORSTENSON: For shame, Gustaf.\n\nBANÉR: If we’d just limit ourselves to serving rather than giving advice, I think we’d be better off.\n\nHORN: My thoughts exactly.\n\n***\n\nBRAHE (enters): Where’s the king?\n\nBANÉR: Who knows? — Here he is.\n\nKING (enters, upset, without his hat, clothes disheveled): Now this. Now this! Compromise, concede, withdraw! They threw stones at me. See, I lost my hat. And now they’re plundering. — Here are the articles of war—our good, pure intentions—torn to pieces. (Scatters around printed pages from a torn book.) The Swedish soldier is no better than the emperor’s men. Identical scoundrels. — Listen to the screams of the innocent people. (Puts his hands over his ears.) Nils, sit down here by me. You look like you have something to say.\n\nBRAHE: Your Majesty, there is a way out of this.\n\nKING: Can I get out of it?\n\nBRAHE: Yes, there’s one way. Only one.\n\nKING: Tell me.\n\nBRAHE: The French ambassador is here.\n\nKING (stands): He’s always after me. Tempting me to the devil. — — — Get him behind me.\n\nBRAHE: But then Marcus won’t get behind you. And he’d be right. Marcus would be ruined. He’s a family man with duties, feelings, and a legitimate claim on life.\n\nKING (childish, sly): Where is Erik Rålamb?\n\nBRAHE (roguish): He’s been sent too far away to hear you.\n\nKING: Why are you so mean to me? You all are, because I have to be lenient with you — thanks to the sins of my father [at Linköping]…\n\n***\n\nTOTT (rushes in): Your Majesty, this is going beyond all reason. I’m not squeamish, but I can’t stand to hear women and children screaming curses at us. — If they were the enemy, perhaps, but they’re our friends and fellow believers—\n\nKING: Stop, Åke —\n\nTOTT: No, I can’t be silent. Two thousand enemy troops cut down, a thousand Croats captured, but not a single enemy left in the city. Why in God’s name do we continue?\n\n***\n\nFABRICIUS (enters): The king called for me.\n\nKING: Yes, because I have these terrible advisors. Listen. The troops have mutinied because they weren’t allowed to plunder; without an army, I can’t wage war —\n\nFABRICIUS: The troops demanded plundering because they weren’t paid. Pay them and they’ll stop plundering.\n\nKING: I have no money. (Pause.) I can hear your thoughts through your silence. I’m listening. Go ahead, counsel me.\n\nFABRICIUS: No. I was sent here to comfort the dying and the ill, not to be a military advisor.\n\nKING (to Horn): Counsel me, Gustaf Horn.\n\nHORN: No. I’m just a servant. Only the king commands and is accountable.\n\nKING (to Tott): Åke?\n\nTOTT: I don’t understand statecraft; I’m just a soldier.\n\nKING (to Torstenson): Lennart?\n\nTORSTENSON: (silent.)\n\nKING: Nils Brahe, say this: Of two evils, one must choose the lesser, but if the two choices are equally evil, then one doesn’t get to choose. That’s Nils’s advice. — So now I’ll go to the French ambassador.\n\nBANÉR (blocks the doorway): No. Not the king. Our king will stay as pure as the flag we follow. Gustaf Horn, prove that you can get your hands dirty for your king.\n\nHORN (stands): Well said, Banér. Let us muck around in the dirt, but not him. To the French ambassador, then. We’ve heard the mandate.\n\nKING (childishly pleased, as if he escaped something unpleasant): Thank you, my friends. It takes more courage to do something repugnant than to capture a fortress. (When Brahe follows them.) No, Nils, not you.\n\nHorn and Banér go.\n\nKING (sinks onto a chair): This is exactly what I didn’t want. But thy will be done, Lord.\n\nCurtain.\n\nScene 3\n\nIn a camp outside Frankfurt an der Oder. In the foreground, the King sits by a simple table. Lars Grubbe stands beside him. In the background, part of the city is visible.\n\nKING: I’ve signed the agreement with France and I’m waiting for the money. Now I can force the Brandenburger and the Saxon into an alliance against the emperor.\n\nGRUBBE: Is it a substantial sum?\n\nKING: A half million French livres per year.\n\nGRUBBE: And the conditions?\n\nKING: I didn’t promise anything. I only signed my name. You know the bullet from Dirschau hinders me from writing anything more than that—and the wound has been bothering me more recently. Look, here comes the blood money.\n\nHorn, Banér, accompanied by the Sergeant Major, who are carrying blue linen bags, are escorted in by six Finnish cavalrymen led by the Finnish Ensign.\n\nHORN: Your Majesty, the agreement was ratified and the money is hereby submitted.\n\nKING: Lars Grubbe, go and pay the bills from Marcus of Hamburg. Then distribute half of what’s left to the soldiers. With the remaining half, try to make reparations for the plundering.\n\nGRUBBE: Pardon, Your Majesty, but then we’ll be just as poor in the morning.\n\nKING: So be it. Aren’t we Christians — even if we’re not apostles or missionaries? Go and do what is right first, or we can’t expect to be blessed.\n\nGrubbe goes, followed by the escort.\n\nKING (who has seen the ensign): Ensign, stay.\n\nFinnish Ensign remains, terrified.\n\nKING: Come here. What’s your name?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (speaking now without his Finnish accent): Axel Eriksson, of the Finnish cavalry.\n\nKING: Any other name?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Other name?\n\nKING: We’ll get to that. — You were among those who threw stones at me recently. And you were one of the leaders of the mutiny.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Majesty, that wasn’t me.\n\nKING: Ah, so then it was Sparre.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN (falls to his knees): Mercy.\n\nKING: Axel Eriksson Sparre. Your father lost his life in the bloodbath at Linköping because he didn’t want to break his oath of loyalty to King Sigismund. Your mother’s name was Brahe—Ebba, no less—and her father, old Count Peder called my grandfather King Gösta [Gustav Vasa] uncle. You’re my kinsman; that you can’t be my friend, I understand. What my father did to yours you can’t forgive. But I forgive you what you’ve done to me. — Do you want to stay in my service?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: Majesty, I’m not worthy of your mercy.\n\nKING: Rise, then, and try to be worthy.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: I don’t know—\n\nKING: Don’t you know if you can trust yourself?\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: No! I was a child when my father died in Linköping. And I was on my knees in the snow next to my mother to beg the Duke for mercy when he rode past. We stayed there for hours. I cried, I froze… When the Duke finally came, he looked away from us, but his horse kicked dirt into my face. I swore then—\n\nKING: I understand all that, and I would have done the same as that poor child. But now these two noble lords—Horn and Banér, also kinsman of those who fell at Linköping—they have forgiven. Go, Sparre, and try to do the same.\n\nFINNISH ENSIGN: I wish I could, but—\n\nKING: Just stay and if the temptation becomes to great, come to me, free yourself from your hate. But don’t try to hurt me. Behind my plain coat and unassuming manner hides the Lord’s anointed one. (stands) Farewell.\n\nThe Finnish Ensign goes, after looking back as if he’d like to say something else.\n\n***\n\nKING: Why should I have to be reminded of that today, of what needs to be atoned for? And why has the bullet from Dirschau, Sigismund’s souvenir, started to bother me again? The thorn in the flesh. — It’s sad to be alive — sometimes… There’s Lennart, nearly running. It must be important if it got him to hurry.\n\n***\n\nTORSTENSON: Your Majesty, important news —\n\nKING: Quickly!\n\nTORSTENSON: Wallenstein has been dismissed.\n\nKING: What does that mean for us?\n\nTORSTENSON: The Assembly of Electors in Regensburg demanded his dismissal, and he gave up his command, disbanded his army, and shut himself away in Gitschin, his castle in Bohemia.\n\nKING: Has the emperor lost his mind? To disarm in the face of your enemy, to withdraw!? What does it mean?\n\nTORSTENSON: No one knows.\n\nKING: Is the war over, then? Who would I fight?\n\nHORN: Tilly. Tilly remains.\n\nKING: He doesn’t matter. — No, Wallenstein was real the enemy. — Do you remember what the Governor said about the emperor’s plans? And now he’s gone. Don’t you miss him?\n\nHORN: No. Just focus on Tilly.\n\nKING: I have Tilly sewn up in the forests of Thuringia; all that’s left is to knot the threads. — Let’s go to Berlin. Follow me, Banér. (Exits, accompanied by Banér.)\n\nHORN: What now?\n\nTORSTENSON: This bright, cheerful mood usually only follows a clear conscience.\n\nHORN: This divine good cheer that makes him think everything he does is right.\n\nTORSTENSON: But you saw that what happened was unavoidable. How could he have a guilty conscience about something that couldn’t be avoided?\n\nHORN: Nevertheless, in just a few hours we’ve become mercenaries for Catholic France instead of their allies. France hasn’t committed to join the war, just pay for it. What has this war become? Cardinal Richelieu against the Hapsburgs. But do you know France’s conditions that the king didn’t want to read?\n\nTORSTENSON: No.\n\nHORN: Well, Sweden has agreed to remain neutral to the Catholic League and the Elector of Bavaria.\n\nTORSTENSON: That’s nonsense. Or it means the war is over.\n\nHORN: Do you believe our good king has a clear idea of what this war is?\n\nTORSTENSON: Hardly. But Oxenstierna did. Do you remember what he told the council? That “the main objective of the German war was by no means to defend religion—the weapons for that are spiritual, such as prayer and tears—but rather to obtain for the Swedish crown and its religious allies, the German electors, security and independence.”\n\nHORN: Thank God it’s not a religious war, because our weapons aren’t spiritual.\n\nTORSTENSON: But the king came over here with his bright, happy faith—\n\nHORN: Just let him be. He’ll walk safely on his rope as long as he sleeps, but if you wake him, he’ll fall into the net. He left Oxenstierna at home so he’d be undisturbed. He always has to analyze everything and rip the king’s impulsive conclusions to shreds. We can all see that we’re moving forward, forward toward something unknown, undefined—but forward all the same.\n\nPause.\n\nTORSTENSON: Do you believe the king intends to honor the neutrality provisions?\n\nHORN: Today, yes. Even tomorrow. But he’ll break them the day after that.\n\nTORSTENSON: That’s called the art of statecraft: to make a promise and not keep it. (stands)\n\nHORN: Let’s stick to the art of war then, Lennart, where we just do what we can. (stands) So then, to Berlin.\n\nCurtain.\n\nScene Four\n\nPark outside the palace, Berlin. Clipped trees and bushes, trellises, colonnades, a fountain, benches, tables. Above them the palace is visible with lighted windows and an open balcony with people in formal wear.\n\nHorn and Banér enter.\n\nHORN: The elector is certainly not expecting us at his party.\n\nBANÉR: It would be a bit much to expect him to receive twenty thousand men and Torstenson’s cannons in his salon.\n\nHORN: True, but it’s beyond insulting to reluctantly receive the Swedish king.\n\nBANÉR: There’s the king. — Now it will be the elector looking for an audience.\n\n***\n\nKING: Here we are, as planned. And promptly. Good. (looks up at the palace) Thoroughly ugly building, isn’t it? Regardless… — Now, Johan, go up to the palace and tell the Elector his brother-in-law is receiving visitors here in the park. And if he wants to throw you out, go to a window and wave your sash. Torstenson will respond with an immediate volley, which we’ll call a welcoming salute. — Are you scared, Johan?\n\nBANÉR: Scared? Only of the stares of beautiful women. I’m not afraid of rattling the Elector.\n\nKING: So then. Forward and upward.\n\nBanér runs up the stairs and enters the palace.\n\n***\n\nKING (sitting on a bench): Coming. Not coming. Coming. Not coming—\n\nHORN: He’s coming.\n\nKING: Where is Erik Rålamb now?\n\nHORN: He was sent to Magdeburg.\n\nKING: I miss him sometimes, despite his intolerable interference. He’s never easy, but his high ideals never troubled me, though they made me pale by comparison. (The widowed Princess Anna [the King’s mother-in-law] and Princess Catherine [the widow of Gabriel Bethlen and the King’s sister-in-law] walk past in the background.) No, look. My mother-in-law and my sister-in-law. And I let myself be surprised here like an apple thief in an orchard. (hides behind a tree; the women exit.) I don’t care for this. I’d rather have stormed the palace with sword in hand.\n\nHORN: I see Johan. The palace is taken.\n\nBanér is seen on the palace balcony; waves his sash; a cannon shot is heard and then a volley of musket shots. Movement in the palace windows. Banér disappears.\n\nKING: Now he’s coming.\n\n***\n\nGeorg Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg and Gustav Adolf’s brother-in-law, comes down from upstage with Banér; they’re having a heated exchange. The King moves toward them a few steps, then stops to wait.\n\nELECTOR (upset): I can’t bid you welcome, brother-in-law or not, when you show up with your army on my land.\n\nKING: No need. I come to a kinsman and a fellow believer—\n\nELECTOR (irritated): May I point out that I’m not your fellow believer—I’m a Calvinist, so the religious peace of Augsburg has nothing to do with—\n\nKING: There are so many confessions of faith here that there’s no point speaking of them. But we do have a common enemy—\n\nELECTOR: We had a common enemy: France. But now you’ve allied yourself with the enemy, which is why we can no longer be friends.\n\nKING: That’s direct. So, as an enemy, then, I demand with strength of my superior forces that you surrender the fortresses at "
