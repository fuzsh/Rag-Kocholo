        "text": "Sweden honoured the Duke of Edinburgh ahead of his funeral on Saturday afternoon. Flags at the Royal Place were flown at half-mast, the Swedish Royal Family sent a wreath to the British Royal Family, and the Seraphim Toll took place from 12.00 to 13.00 Swedish time in Riddarholm Church in Stockholm.\n\nThe Duke was a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim in Sweden, and it is a tradition in Sweden to hold a Seraphim Toll for a deceased Knight of the Order of the Seraphim on the same day as the funeral. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf on 23 June 1954; he was the 683rd Knight since the Order’s creation in 1748.\n\nVice Chancellor of the Royal Orders of Knighthood Per Sandin placed Prince Philip’s coat of arms with his date of death in the church’s chancel, and from today, on the shield will hang with the other shields of knights and members who have passed away. Sandin also gave a reading during the Seraphim Toll.\n\nThe Duke’s sash and Order of the Seraphim was on display today in St George’s Chapel, as well, during the funeral.\n\nSince the 1700s, the Coat of Arms of each Knight of the Order of the Seraphim has hung in Riddarholm Church. After a knight passes away, their date of death is added to their Coat of Arms that hangs in the church. The date of death is also announced during the ceremony that begins with the Coat of Arms getting a military escort from the Royal Palace to the church, where it is then hung among the arms and shields of other deceased knights and members."
