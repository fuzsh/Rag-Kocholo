        "text": "Am I the only one who thinks he became better-looking as he was older?\n\nTo me, he's always given the impression of being a very smart man (which of course he was). It seems like none of his descendants really picked up the intellectual bent (?) Queen Margrethe has the archeological mania and the multi talents, but not quite the professorial attitude.\n\nLouise's reaction to realizing he might want to marry her always makes me want to laugh.\n\nDid Queen Louise learn Swedish quickly? Just curious.\n\nAt this biography at the website of The Dictionary of Swedish National Biography it is said:\n\n\"L quickly learned Swedish, with a piquant German-English accent.\"\n\nLouise - Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon\n\nArticle at this blog which always has interesting articles.\n\nAfter a long break, I have again had the opportunity to visit the Apartments of the Orders of Chivalry at the Royal Palace. An interesting novelty in the exhibitions is a British admiral's uniform with orders worn by Gustaf VI Adolf.\n\nGustaf VI Adolfs brittiska amiralsuniform _ Phaleristica\n\nTranslation\n\nA very dapper-looking GA with his flowers at Sofiero. https://c7.alamy.com/comp/DE0CG3/ki...is-summer-residence-sofiero-castle-DE0CG3.jpg\n\n(If this was really 1972, then he was 90 or very close. He looks great! )\n\nThat's some enthusiastic crowd.\n\nI wonder if Carl Gustav remembers this?\n\nThe current king would have been just 4 and had lost his father aged just 1 and from what I've read his grandfather was a popular king!\n\nThe current king would have been just 4 and had lost his father aged just 1 and from what I've read his grandfather was a popular king!\n\nAs he was there in the video being held by his grandfather and that was a very exceptional occasion, I wonder if CG doesn’t remember something. But I’m sure one of our Swedish experts has more insight.\n\nThat's some enthusiastic crowd.\n\nI wonder if Carl Gustav remembers this?\n\nHe has never talked publicly about his grandfathers accession... Had he remembered it, he would have talked about it... They were very close...\n\nDid Queen Louise learn Swedish quickly? Just curious.\n\nI have heard a radio recording of Louise speaking swedish when she was still Crown Princess, and she spoke it almost fluently with an (for our time) old fashioned dialect...\n\nShe was fluent/almost native in at least German and possibly spoke something else in addition to English, so that probably helped with Swedish.\n\nhas the king ever spoken about his grandfather ? GA from what ive read and seen in the interviews with his grandaughters (Of denmark) he seems like a loving father /grandfather\n\nThe Royal Court published yesterday at its social media:\n\n50 years ago today, King Gustaf VI Adolf was laid to rest.\n\nThe funeral service took place in the Stockholm Cathedral in Old Town in Stockholm. The king was then buried at the Royal Cemetery in Haga park.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CxnTGGdqpSp/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=848941939937261&set=a.376116297219830\n\nRoyal expert Roger Lundgren's article\n\nGustaf VI Adolf: The old King saved Sweden's monarchy\n\nThis autumn it is 50 years since King Gustaf VI Adolf fell asleep, aged 91. Despite a life with many personal tragedies, he was a dutiful monarch who served Sweden to the end. Many believe that the monarchy still exists in Sweden thanks to the old King's personal qualities.\n\nGustaf VI Adolf_ Gamle kungen räddade Sveriges monarki\n\nTranslation"
