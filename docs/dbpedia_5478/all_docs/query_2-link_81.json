        "text": "Wondering where the royal family escapes for vacation? Most historians agree the British monarchy began losing political power all the way back in 1215, when King John of England signed the Magna Carta, transitioning the nation over to constitutional law. Eight centuries later, the royals serve more as regal figureheads than as lawmakers and rulers. Maybe that’s why, in modern times, they find so much more time to go on holidays, reportedly spending $5 million on travel in 2022.\n\nAlways the tastemakers, these contemporary regal Brits tend to seek out and check into some of the world’s most elegant hotels, from Texas to the Taj Mahal. And what they lack in political power, they make up for in influence: The Carlyle's “Royal Suite” is still one of the most requested rooms at the hotel, thanks to the late Princess Diana's fondness for it. Ready to follow in the monarchy’s stately footsteps?\n\nBelow, our favorite royal family vacation hideaways. Book a room at one of these 17 properties, all of them fit for—well, you know.\n\nSoho Beach House Canouan in St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nJust weeks ago, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle enjoyed their boho-chic stay at the Soho Beach House in the Caribbean. The couple’s history with the members-only club includes vacations at the Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds, and Soho House Toronto–where they celebrated Halloween with Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.\n\nFairmont Empress in British Columbia\n\nThe British monarchy has a long history with this fortress-like hotel in downtown Victoria, British Columbia. During their Royal Tour of Canada in 2016, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, known as William and Kate, were accompanied by their little royals, Princess Charlotte and Prince George.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla visited in 2009, and Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip made a stop in 2002. In 1939, King George VI and the Queen Mother spent the night as part of their Canada Royal Tour, and all the way back in 1919, Edward, Prince of Wales, spent the night waltzing with glamorous ladies in the hotel’s Crystal Ballroom.\n\nChaa Creek in Belize\n\nIn 2012, Prince Harry visited this eco-resort in western Belize, dining on traditional kak'ik soup, visiting ancient Mayan ruins, and sleeping in a Treetop Suite—an airy accommodation high up in the greenery, with a private jacuzzi and lots of light. The secluded resort, located on an organic farm and engulfed by jungle, played host to Harry during his Diamond Jubilee tour, which honored Queen Elizabeth II’s 60 years on the throne. Unsurprisingly, the hotel staff deemed Harry friendly, laid-back, and warm.\n\nThe Adolphus in Dallas\n\nIt’s perhaps not easy to imagine a royal couple traipsing around the great state of Texas, but in 1991, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip did just that, paying a visit to Dallas’s iconic Adolphus hotel. The lobby’s pianist played “God Save the Queen” when they arrived, and the couple had afternoon tea in the hotel before retiring to the Wendy Reves Suite, the most luxurious accommodation at the time. In 2018, the historic, 111-year-old property underwent a massive two-year renovation.\n\nHassler Roma in Rome\n\nThis legendary five-star hotel, perched at the top of the Spanish Steps, has played host to Prince Charles and Princess Diana (along with a laundry list of other European nobility, including King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, Prince Félix de Luxembourg, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and Prince Rainier of Monaco—during his honeymoon with Grace Kelly). The property is known for its views of the Eternal City and its Michelin-starred Imàgo restaurant.\n\nMeno a Kwena in Botswana\n\nHarry and Meghan Markle’s third date was a five-day trip to Botswana, just weeks after their initial blind date. The following year, Harry whisked Megan away back to Meno a Kwena for her birthday. The sustainable safari lodge, with romantic tents perched on the edge of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, is nestled on a secluded cliff overlooking the Boteti River. It's safe to assume that Botswana is a cherished destination for Harry, having visited multiple times over the last three decades. Falling in love while camping under the stars seems almost inevitable, doesn't it? Meghan's Botswana-sourced diamond engagement ring empathically says yes.\n\nHotel Adlon Kempinski in Berlin\n\nSteps from Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate sits the Hotel Adlon, a sprawling urban spot that’s equal parts old-world glamour and modern elegance. Queen Elizabeth II once counted herself among the guests, as did Barack Obama, who elected this hotel during his last overseas trip as POTUS.\n\nHotel Excelsior Dubrovnik in Croatia\n\nThis Croatian landmark, built into a one-time royal villa and overlooking both the Adriatic Sea and the city’s Old Town, offers up subdued elegance and a private beach; perhaps that’s why both Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret (not to mention American royalty Edward Kennedy) have all paid visits.\n\nRutundu Log Cabin in Kenya\n\nWhere Prince William proposed to Princess Kate in 2010. A rustic, off-grid cabin, completely cut off from the rest of the world, with no WiFi or network access. There's also no electricity, with the only sources of light being the sun, candles, and Kate's 12-carat sapphire-and-diamond cluster engagement ring.\n\nHotel Arlberg in Austria\n\nWhen her boys were young, Princess Diana elected to bring them to this half-century-old hotel. The sprawling lodge offers up the Austria you’ve been picturing since you first watched The Sound of Music: Think snowcapped mountains; elevated comfort food; and grand, comfortable guest rooms.\n\nLlangoed Hall in Wales\n\nThis charming mansion in Wales’s Wye Valley looks so downright regal that it's no surprise it was a filming site for Downton Abbey: Fictional royalty stayed inside the Edwardian estate. And, real-life British royals have been known to drop by, too, with Prince Charles making annual visits and Will and Kate planning regular stays.\n\nThe Williamsburg Inn in Virginia\n\nA bit of trivia: There’s only one American hotel where Queen Elizabeth II planned two separate stays. It’s this historic five-star hotel, built in the ’30s to evoke the experience of being welcomed into a gracious, upscale Virginian estate. The late queen visited in 1957 with her husband, Prince Philip, and again in 2007 for the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement.\n\nBroadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs\n\nIn 2013, Harry traveled to Colorado Springs for the Warrior Games, an athletic competition for wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans. He opted to stay at the century-old Broadmoor Resort, a five-star, five-diamond inn hidden in the Rockies and offering zip-lining, horseback riding, and fly-fishing. His guestroom was in the west building complex, then the property’s most luxurious accommodations; if you’re looking for a room similarly fit for a king, book the Parker Suite in the reimagined Broadmoor West building, insiders suggest.\n\nTaj Mahal Palace in Mumbai\n\nIn 2016, Will and Kate traveled to India and Bhutan. The first stop on their royal tour was a stay at this ornate Mumbai hotel, where the couple declined to sleep in the Presidential Suite, instead setting up in the 1,500-square-foot Rajput Suite. There, they made good use of the room’s amenities: Compliments of Jiva, the hotel’s spa, they enjoyed a couple’s Jivaniya treatment with an herbal scrub, a wrap with Indian herbs and spices, and a massage.\n\nThe Carlyle in New York City\n\nLong dubbed the “Palace of Secrets,” The Carlyle (and its Royal Suite) was a coveted retreat for Princess Di, particularly during her solo visits to the city, and in the lead-up to her divorce from Prince Charles. In 2014, Princess William and Kate followed suit with their visit to the iconic hotel, and in 2021, Harry and Meghan also made a stop.\n\nBlue Waters Resort & Spa in Antigua\n\nIn that same year, as part of his royal visit to seven sunny Caribbean nations, Harry stayed at the Blue Waters Resort & Spa in Antigua. Though the discreet hotel won’t share details, we’re unsurprised he chose this secluded spot on Antigua’s northwestern shore: It’s brimming with infinity pools, private beachfront, and 17 acres of heavenly scented tropical gardens.\n\nFairmont Chateau Whistler in British Columbia\n\nIn March 1998, less than a year after Princess Di’s death, Prince Charles brought William and Harry here for four quiet days of skiing and relaxation. The Alpine lodge sits inside Whistler Blackcomb, the largest ski resort on the continent with more than 8,100 acres of skiable terrain."
