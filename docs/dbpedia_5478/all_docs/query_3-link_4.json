The monarchs of the House of Vasa were buried in several different sites. However, most were buried at Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nAll photos are from Wikipedia unless otherwise noted.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden\n\nOfficial Website: Uppsala Cathedral\n\nUppsala Cathedral was built in the 13th to 15th centuries and it is the tallest church in the Scandanavian countries. Originally built as a Roman Catholic cathedral, it is now a place of worship for the Church of Sweden, a Protestant denomination. It is the burial site of King Erik IX, Sweden’s national saint, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was built. Uppsala Cathedral was the traditional site for the coronation of the Swedish monarch from the middle of the 15th century until the end of the 17th century when the Storkyrkan (Great Church) in Stockholm became the coronation church. After the coronation of King Oscar II in 1873, subsequent Swedish monarchs chose not to be crowned. Several of the chapels at Uppsala Cathedral were converted to house the tombs of Swedish monarchs and their families, archbishops, and notable people.\n\nHouse of Vasa\n\nKing Gustav I of Sweden (reigned 1523 – 1560)\n\nKing Erik XIV of Sweden (reigned 1560 – 1569, deposed)\n\nKing Johan III of Sweden (reigned 1569 – 1592)\n\nKing Sigismund III Vasa of Sweden (1592 – 1599, deposed)\n\nKing Karl IX of Sweden (Regent of Sweden 1599–1604, King of Sweden 1604 – 1611)\n\nKing Gustavus II Adolphus the Great of Sweden (reigned 1611 – 1632)\n\nQueen Christina of Sweden (reigned 1632 – 1654, abdicated)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Kingdom of Sweden Index\n\nWikipedia: House of Vasa\n\n********************\n\nGustav I, King of Sweden (reigned June 6, 1523 – September 29, 1560)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Gustav I, King of Sweden\n\nKing Gustav I was born as Gustav Eriksson Vasa on May 12, 1496, the son of Erik Johansson Vasa, a Swedish noble and the Lord of Rydboholm Castle, and Cecilia Månsdotter Eka, a Swedish noblewoman. Since 1397, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union in which the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ruled by one monarch. Denmark was dominant in the Kalmar Union and this occasionally led to uprisings in Sweden. In 1520, King Christian II of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, who asserted his claim to Sweden by force, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles. The actions of King Christian II stirred the Swedish nobility to a new resistance. During the Swedish War of Liberation (1521 – 1523), Gustav Vasa successfully deposed King Christian II from the throne of Sweden, ending the Kalmar Union between Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. On June 6, 1523, Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden by the Swedish Riksdag (legislature).\n\nGustav I, King of Sweden married three times:\n\nKatharina of Saxe-Lauenburg on September 24, 1531, had one son\n\nMargaret Leijonhufvud on October 1, 1536, had ten children\n\nKaterina Stenbock on August 22, 1552, no children\n\nKing Gustav I died on September 29, 1560, aged 64, at Tre Kronor Castle (Three Crowns Castle) which stood on the site of the present Stockholm Palace in Stockholm, Sweden, and was buried in the Vasa Chapel at Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden with his first two wives.

She married King Gustav I of Sweden in Stockholm, Sweden on September 24, 1531. In 1533, she gave birth to the future Eric XIV, King of Sweden.\n\nDuring her second pregnancy, Katharina had a fall that led to complications. 22-year-old Katharina died on September 23, 1535, along with her unborn child. She was initially buried in the Storkykan (Great Church) in Stockholm, Sweden on October 1, 1535. On December 21, 1560, following the death of her husband, her remains were reburied at Uppsala Cathedral together with her husband King Gustav I and his second wife Margareta Leijonhufvud.\n\nMargareta Leijonhufvud, Queen of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Margareta Leijonhufvud, Queen of Sweden\n\nA member of the Leijonhufvud family, one of Sweden’s most powerful noble families, Margareta Leijonhufvud was born on January 1, 1516, at Ekeberg Castle in Närke, Sweden. She was the daughter of Erik Abrahamsson Leijonhufvud and Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, the second cousin of King Gustav I. On October 1, 1536, Margareta married King Gustav I, a year after the death of his first wife. Margareta had ten children and her constant pregnancies took a toll on her health and she died from pneumonia at the age of 35. She was temporarily buried at Uppsala Cathedral until after her husband’s death when her remains were reburied together with her husband King Gustav I and his first wife Katharina of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n\nKaterina Stenbock, Queen of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Katerina Stenbock, Queen of Sweden\n\nBorn on July 22, 1535 in Torpa, Västergötland, Sweden, Katerina Stenbock was the daughter of Gustaf Olofsson Stenbock and Brita Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud, who was the sister of King Gustav I’s second wife Margareta Leijonhufvud. On August 22, 1552, 17-year-old Katerina married 56-year-old King Gustav I but they had no children. Katerina never remarried despite being only 25-yeas old when King Gustav I died. She dressed in mourning for the rest of her life. She survived her husband by sixty-one years, dying on December 13, 1621, aged 86, and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden but has no monument or memorial.\n\n********************\n\nErik XIV, King of Sweden (reigned September 29, 1560 – September 29, 1568, deposed)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Erik XIV, King of Sweden\n\nBorn on December 13, 1533, at Stockholm Castle in Stockholm, Sweden, Erik was the only surviving child of King Gustav I and his first wife Katharina of Saxe-Lauenburg who died due to childbirth complications two years after Erik was born.

Erik was imprisoned in various castles for eight years. He died on February 26, 1577, aged 43, at Örbyhus Castle in Örbyhus, Sweden. He was most likely murdered due to the three major conspiracies that attempted to depose his half-brother Johan III and place Erik back on the Swedish throne. An examination of his remains in 1958 confirmed that Erik probably died of arsenic poisoning. Erik XIV, King of Sweden was originally buried in a crypt at Västerås Cathedral in Västerås, Västmanland, Sweden. In 1797, Erik’s remains were reburied at Västerås Cathedral in a Carrara marble sarcophagus that King Gustav III originally ordered for himself.\n\nKarin Månsdotter, Queen of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Karin Månsdotter, Queen of Sweden\n\nKarin Månsdotter, also known as Catharina, was born November 6, 1550, in Stockholm, Sweden.

She was a maid to King Erik XIV’s half-sister Elisabet before became mistress Erik’s mistress in 1565. By 1568, Karin and Erik XIV had two children. On July 4, 1568, Karin married King Erik XIV and was crowned Queen of Sweden the next day. Two more children, who both died young, were born after the marriage. Karin survived her husband by 35 years, dying on September 13, 1612, at the age of 61, at her estate Liuksiala Kungsgård, located in Kangasala, Finland, which was part of the Kingdom of Sweden at that time.

On October 4, 1562, Katarina married the future Johan III, King of Sweden in the Lower Castle of Vilnius, Lithuania. The couple had three children.\n\nIn the spring of 1583, Katarina became seriously ill with gout, and after much suffering, she died on September 16, 1583, aged 56, at Tre Kronor Castle in Stockholm, Sweden, and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nGunilla Bielke, Queen of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Gunilla Bielke, Queen of Sweden\n\nGunilla Bielke was born on June 25, 1568, the daughter of Johan Axelsson Bielke, Governor of Östergötland and Margareta Axelsdotter Posse.

After the death of Queen Katarina, Gunilla married Johan III, King of Sweden on February 21, 1585, and they had one son. Gunilla survived her husband by only five years, dying at the age of 29 of a fever at Bråborg Castle in Östergötland, Sweden on July 19, 1597.

Upon his father’s death in 1611, 16-year-old Gustavus Adolphus became King of Sweden with his mother serving as Regent until he became of age. Gustavus Adolphus married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. The couple had two stillborn children, a daughter who died in infancy, and their last child, a daughter who succeeded her father as Queen Christina of Sweden.\n\nGustavus Adolphus, aged 37, was killed in the Battle of Lützen during the Thirty Years War on November 16, 1632. Gustavus’s wife kept his body at Nyköping Castle for over a year. Finally, the remains of Gustavus Adolphus were interred on June 22, 1634, at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nMaria Eleonora of Brandenburg, Queen of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, Queen of Sweden\n\nBorn on November 11, 1599, in Königsberg, Duchy of Prussia, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg was the daughter of Johann Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Anna of Prussia of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. Maria Eleonora married Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden in Stockholm, Sweden on November 25, 1620. After having two stillbirths and a daughter who died in infancy, Maria Eleonora finally gave her husband his much-needed heir Christina in 1626. Christina became Queen of Sweden at the age of six upon the death of her father. Maria Eleanora was offended when she was not included in the regency government during the minority of her daughter, as the council of the state did not consider her suitable as regent.\n\nMaria Eleanora survived her husband by twenty-three years, dying at the age of 55, on March 28, 1655, in Stockholm, Sweden, shortly after her daughter Queen Christina abdicated in favor of her cousin who reigned as Carl X Gustaf, King of Sweden. Maria Eleanora was interred next to her husband at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n********************\n\nChristina, Queen of Sweden (reigned November 16, 1632 – June 16, 1654, abdicated)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Christina, Queen of Sweden\n\nBorn on December 18, 1626, at Tre Kronor Castle in Stockholm Sweden, Christina, Queen of Sweden was the only surviving child of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden and Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. She became Queen of Sweden at the age of six upon the death of her father in battle. Christina caused a scandal when she decided not to marry and when she abdicated her throne and subsequently converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nChristina left Sweden and lived most of the rest of her life in Rome where she played a prominent role in the city’s cultural life. She died, aged 62, on April 19, 1689, at the Palazzo Corsini in Rome after suffering from erysipelas, an acute bacterial infection, and pneumonia. Christina had asked for a simple burial in the Pantheon in Rome. However, Pope Innocent XI insisted that her body be displayed and interred in the fashion of a pope. She is one of three women to be interred in the crypt at St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican.\n\n********************"
