        "text": "The funeral for Prince Philip has concluded at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle after hymns and prayers for the royal consort of 72 years.\n\nThe coffin of the late Duke of Cambridge, who died aged 99 on Friday, April 9, was lowered into the Royal Vault at the close of the ceremony on Friday. Royal Marine buglers sounded the naval battle call “Action Stations” in deference to a personal request from the departed royal.\n\nAt the funeral, the Duke was remembered as a man of \"courage, fortitude and faith\" who had supported the Queen and the British nation throughout his life.\n\nThe ceremony was led by the Right Reverend David Conner, the Dean of Windsor, while the blessing was given by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who praised the Duke for the \"courage and inspiration of his leadership\". There were no eulogies.\n\nDraped in his personal standard and topped with a wreath of flowers and his naval cap and sword, Prince Philip's coffin was borne to the chapel in a custom-built Land Rover hearse that he himself designed over a period of 16 years.\n\nHis coffin was draped in his personal standard and topped with a wreath of flowers and his naval cap and sword. The Queen followed behind in the State Bentley while the royal couple's four children, Princess Anne and Princes Charles, Edward and Andrew walking behind the coffin.\n\nThree of their grandchildren, including Princes William and Harry, as well as Peter Phillips, their nephew and the Earl of Snowdon, and Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, also walked behind the Land Rover.\n\nSenior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle during the eight-minute procession from the State Entrance of Windsor Castle to the chapel. Some 700 servicemen and women from the military are performing ceremonial roles in the procession in a nod to Prince Philip's own decorated military service.\n\nCrowds lined the long walk in Windsor earlier on Saturday as mounted guards from The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery paraded to Windsor Castle accompanied by gun salutes, alongside Guards regiments in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats, Highlanders in kilts and sailors in white naval hats.\n\nThe funeral service was limited to just 30 guests due to COVID-19 restrictions. The guests were all masked throughout the proceedings.\n\nPrince Philip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral had a maritime theme, including the hymn “Eternal Father, Strong to Save,” which is associated with seafarers and asks God: “O hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.”\n\nOther European countries also paid their respects to Prince Philip on Saturday. Bells rang out from the Riddarholm Church in Stockholm, Sweden for a full hour to honour the late Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe Duke was made a Knight of Sweden's Order of the Seraphim in 1954 by the country's previous monarch, King Gustaf VI Adolf. \"This is to salute the memory of the dead knight of the order,\" said Per Sandin, Vice Chancellor of the Royal Order of Knighthood. \"It's kind of a 'thank you' and 'goodbye' from the royal household of Sweden.\"\n\nIn nearby Denmark, flags were also flown at half mask at the Danish Royal Palace. Philip was born Prince of Denmark and Greece before becoming a naturalised British citizen in the 1940s.\n\nWatch Euronews' live TV coverage in the video player above."
