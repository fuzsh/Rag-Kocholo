        "text": "MAP OF VASTERNORRLAND\n\n(MAP CREDIT: GEOATLAS.COM)\n\nVasternorrland County (Vasternorrlands lan) is a county (lan) in the north of Sweden on the Gulf of Bothnia. The name Vasternorrland means “Western Norland,” as it was in the western part of the original Norrland (northern Sweden and northern Finland).\n\nVasternorrland’s area takes in most of the two traditional provinces of Medelpad and Angermanland. Vasternorrland has an area of 23,107 square meters (8,922 square miles).\n\nNorrland has high mountains, rushing rivers, small cold mountain brooks, lakes, sea, forests and wilderness. Along the coast of the northern part of Sweden are many beautiful cities and towns. Some of the cities along the coastline are Ornskoldsvik, Harnosand and Sundsvall, which are major shipping centers for timber and pulp.\n\nSkuleskogen National Park is located 27 km (17 miles) south of Ornskoldsvik and 40 km (25 miles) north of Kramfors. It covers a surface of 3,062 hectares (7,570 acres), of which 282 hectares (700 acres) are maritime. There are many rocky peaks. The highest peak is Slattdalsberget, which is 280 meters (920 feet) high.\n\nVasternorrland is said to be the land of Sweden’s “green gold” due to huge forests, forestry industries and a centuries-old tradition and expertise in wood-working skills.\n\nThe municipalities within Vasternorrland are Harmosand (population 25,269) Kramfors (18,681), Solleftea (19,846), Sundsvall (98,325), Timra (17,992), Ange (9,495) and Ornskoldsvik (55,964). The total population of Vasternorrland County is 245,572.\n\n(Source: Statistiska Centralbyran, Sverige.)\n\nThe largest populations within Vasternorrland County are Sundsvall (including Johannedal, Sundsbruk and Tunadal — 58,065), Ornskoldsvik (including Gimat, Overhornas, Arnasvall and Vasterhus — 32,700), Harnosand (18,600), Timra (10,497), Solleftea (including Sollefea norra — 8,885), Kvissleby (including Njurundabommen, Skottsund, Dingersjo, Essvik and Juniskar — 8,797), Kramfors (including Frano — 6,752), and Vi (Alvik including Gustavsberg — 5,827).\n\nHARNOSAND, SWEDEN\n\nHarnosand the seat of Harnosand Municipality. Harnosand is a beautiful small town near the island of Harnon. It is called “the gate to the High Coast” and “the Athens of Northern Sweden.” The town has the largest open-air museum in the northern part of Sweden. The museum is called “Murberget.” Harnosand has a long and rich maritime history. Harnosand was formerly a shipbuilding town. It is located on a beautiful and dramatic coastline. There are three marinas in central Harnosand. The Adalen 3 is a tourist boat that leaves from the dock at the wharf in central Harnosand. Harnosand opened its first theater in the early 1840s. Today’s theater building is located on Central Park and was opened in 1970. The town installed electric street lighting in 1885 — the first place in Europe with such lighting. The city was first built in 1585.\n\nThe High Coast Bridge (Hoga Kusten Bron) spans the Angerman River near Veda on the border between Harnosand and Kramfors. It is the fourth longest suspension bridge in Europe and the third longest suspension bridge in Scandinavia (after the Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark and the Hardanger Bridge in Norway). The bridge was constructed between 1993 and 1997 and was officially opened on Dec. 1, 1997. The total length is 1,867 meters (6,125 feet), the span is 1,210 meters (3,970 feet) and the column pillars are 180 meters (591 feet) tall. The maximum height for ships is 40 meters (131 feet).\n\nHarnosand was granted its town charter in 1585. It is the county’s oldest city.\n\nVIDEO (1:09) OF HARNOSAND # 1 — NARRATION IN SWEDISH\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: HARNOSAND KOMMUN)\n\nVIDEO (5:35) OF HARNOSAND # 2 — NARRATION IN SWEDISH\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: HARNOSAND KOMMUN)\n\nVIDEO (5:36) OF HARNOSAND # 3 — NARRATION IN SWEDISH\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: HARNOSAND KOMMUN)\n\nKRAMFORS, SWEDEN\n\nKramfors is the seat of Kramfors Municipality. The High Coast Bridge (Hoga Kusten Bron) crosses the Angerman River (Angermanalven River) near Kramfors. The suspension bridge spans 180 meters and is only 70 meters shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The larger communities of Umea and Sundsvall are situated within a commuting distance of Kramfors. (Umea is the capital of Vasterbotten County — Vasterbottens lan).\n\nVIDEO (3:34): AERIAL TOUR OF KRAMFORS\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: GUSTAV LORENTZEN)\n\nTHE HIGH COAST BRIDGE (HOGA KUSTEN BRON) AT KRAMFORS, SWEDEN\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: UNKNOWN)\n\nSOLLEFTEA, SWEDEN\n\nSolleftea is the seat of Solleftea Municipality. It is located at the lowest rapids of the Angerman River (Angermanalven). The Angerman River winds through the municipality on its way to the sea. The river is 450 km and is the longest navigable river in Sweden. A building called the “Pharmacy Building” was constructed in 1889 in the neo-Gothic style. The building now serves as a library and the city’s museum. A wooden structure, the Hotel Appelbergs, is located in central Solleftea. It was built in 1882 by lumberman and innkeeper Erik Appelberg. Guests at the hotel have included King Oscar II and King Gustav V.\n\nAlthough Solleftea is an age-old trading and commercial center, it was not granted its charter as a town until 1917. The town is well-known for its military regiment.\n\nThere is salmon and sea trout fishing in the Angerman River in the middle of the town of Solleftea and grayling fishing in the Meaforsen rapids of the Fax River.\n\nMAP OF SOLLEFTEA, SWEDEN\n\n(MAP CREDIT: SOLLEFTEA KOMMUN)\n\nSOLLEFTEA VIDEO (6:24) — NARRATION IN SWEDISH\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: HIGH COAST FILMS AND SOLLEFTEA KOMMUN)\n\nSUNDSVALL, SWEDEN\n\nSundsvall is the seat of Sundsvall Municipality. Sundsvall lies at the mouth of the Selanger River and the Gulf of Bothnia. Sundsvall is the center of one of the most important pulp and paper producing regions in northern Europe. Mid Sweden University (Mittuniversitetet) is located in Sundsvall. The university was founded in 1993 at has about 9,000 students and 550 faculty members. After fires in 1721 and 1803, the town was entirely rebuilt in brick and stone. Kulturmagasinet near the harbor is a cultural center that serves as a library and a museum. Located near Sundsvall is the county’s largest airport, the Sundsvall-Harnosand Airport (aka Sundsvall-Timra Airport).\n\nThe town’s website says:\n\n“Ideally situated in the middle of Sweden near the mouths of the Ljungan and Indalsalven rivers, the town of Sundsvall lies where Selanger Creek flows into Sundsvall Bay and the Gulf of Botnia. Our town is located 380 km North of Stockholm. The town of Sundsvall was rapidly transformed to the industrial centre of the Norrland region during the industrial revolution in the 1880s. In recent years the town has been less depending on heavy industry and more focused on trade and education. The Sundsvall region, home to some 115,000 people, is the most densely populated area of northern Sweden. It plays a prominent role, not only in sports, industry and commerce, but also in education, culture and the arts. In July we host one of the largest street festivals in Sweden. The Gatufesten festival attracts up to 180,000 people.”\n\nHirschska House (Huset) is located in the Nyttan neighborhood of Sundsvall. The Northern European Renaissance structure was completed in 1891 after the devastating Sundsvallsbranden in 1888.\n\nSweden’s largest coastal delta is formed at the mouth of the 430 kilometer Indalsalven River where it flows into the Gulf of Bothnia. (The Indalsalven River has 26 power plants located along its 166-mile stretch.) The airport is located in the middle of the delta. The 322 kilometer long Ljungan River empties into the Gulf of Bothnia just south of Sundsvall.\n\nThere is a ferry from Umea, Sweden to Vaasa, Finland (population 67,495) that is operated by Wasaline. The ferry is called the M/S Wasa Express. The ferry has the capacity to transport 850 passengers and there are two large car decks. The ferry is owned by the cities of Umea and Vaasa. During the peak season the ferry makes eight crossing per week. The ferry’s route across the Kvarken Archipelago takes 4 hours 30 minutes.\n\n(Source: sundsvalltown.se.)\n\nSUNDSVALL, SWEDEN\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: HENRIK SENDELBACH)\n\nVIDEO (1:08) OF SUNDSVALL — SUBTITLES IN SWEDISH\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: SUNDSVALL KOMMUN)\n\nTIMRA, SWEDEN\n\nTimra (10,497) is the seat of Timra Municipality. Indalsalven, one of Sweden’s largest rivers meets the Gulf of Botnia in Timra. A total of 26 hydropower plants are located along the course of the 430 km long river. Timra is located 13 km north of Sundsvall. A 3o-meter high sculpture known as “the Y” was constructed in 1995 at Midlanda Airport (Midlanda Flygplats AB) in Timra by Swedish artist Bengt Karl Erik Lindstrom (1925-2008). Lindstrom studied under Swedish painter Isaac Grunewald (1889-1946) and French painters Andre Lhot(1885-1962) and Fernand Leger (1881-1955). Villa Merlo (Merlo Slott), pictured below, is the only castle in Norrland.\n\nMASSIVE SCULTURE BY BENGT LINDSTROM AT SUNDSVALL TIMRA AIRPORT\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: SUNDSVALL TIMRA AIRPORT)\n\nVILLA MERLO (MERLO SLOTT) IS A CASTLE-LIKE BUILDING IN TIMRA THAT WAS BUILT AS A SUMMER RESIDENCE BY WEALTHY TIMBER MAGNATE FREDERICK BUNSOW BETWEEN 1883-1885\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: NILS JOHAN TJARNLUND)\n\nVIDEO (1:34) OF MERLO SLOTT\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: DANIEL HELLSTRAND)\n\nANGE, SWEDEN\n\nAnge (2,874) is the seat of Ange Municipality. Ange is a railway junction where the northern main line railway (Norra Stambanan) connects with the central main line railway (Mittbanan). Norra Stambanan is a 268 kilometer (167 mile) long electrified railway between Gavle, Sweden and Ange. Mittbanan is a railway from Sundsvall to Storlien to the Swedish-Norweigian border, from where it continues to Torndheim, Norway as the Merakerbanen.\n\nSwedish artist Bengt Lindstrom (1925-2008) created a 6.5 meter high Tangen sculpture made of painted concrete in Ange. It was inaugurated on Sept. 3, 1995 (or 1996) in the presence of the King and Queen of Sweden. The rock bands Takida, The Grand Opening and Corroded are from Ange.\n\nThe town of Borgsjo is located 13 kilometers east of Ange. (Borgsjo is located in Jamtland County (Jamtland lan), Sweden. Ostersund (population 112,717) is Jamtland’s only city.)\n\nRAILWAY TRACKS AT AGNE, SWEDEN\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: ANGE KOMMUN)\n\nORNSKOLDSVIK, SWEDEN\n\nOrnskoldsvik the seat of Ornskoldsvik County. In almost the middle of central Ornskoldsvik is a mountain named “Varvsberget.” The mount is 150 meters high and from the top there is a nice view of the city. There is a ski jump on the mountain called “The Paradise Hill.” Many world famous hockey players began the sport at Ornskoldsvik including Peter Forsberg, Markus Nashlund, Niklas Sundstrom and twins Daniel and Henrik Seldin. Umea University is located about 110 km northeast of Ornskoldsvik in North Middle Sweden, which is partially located in Norrland and mainly in Svealand. (North Middle Sweden is comprised of three counties: Dalarna, Gavleborg and Varmland.) Umea University was founded in 1965 has about 20,500 students and about 2,300 faculty members. Umea University is the largest institution of higher learning in Northern Sweden.\n\nOrnskoldsvik was granted its town charter in 1893. It is the trade and commerce center of the northern part of the province. It has many beautifully restored ancient stone buildings and dramatic new architecture.\n\nWATERFRONT AT ORNSKOLDSVIK\n\n(PHOTO CREDIT: ELITE PLAZA HOTEL)\n\nVIDEO (4:19) ON MODO HOCKEY AT ORNSKOLDVIK, SWEDEN\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: SPORTSNET.CA)\n\nIn 1628, the 69 meter Swedish warship Vasa sunk on its maiden voyage out of Stockholm harbor. The sunken ship was located in 1956 and was recovered in 1961. The ship has been displayed at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm since 1990. Vasa is the world’s only preserved 17th century ship and is Sweden’s biggest archaeological tourist attraction.\n\nVIDEO (2:30): THE SUNKEN WARSHIP FROM THE VASA MUSEUM\n\n(VIDEO CREDIT: VASA MUSEUM, STOCKHOLM)\n\nVasa had a width of about 11 meters and a maximum height of about 20 meters — not including masts. (The ship was more than 50 meters tall from the keel to the top of the main mast.) The hull consisted of three layers and was approximately 40 cm thick. The ship weighed 1,200 tons.\n\nIt is concluded that Vasa, which was fitted with 64 cannons weighing 70 tons, was top-heavy. It capsized and sank after sailing less than one mile. The ship had more than 100 crewmen aboard along with guests including women and children. More than 50 persons drowned. When the ship was recovered about 25 human skeletons were found in the ship.\n\n“Although Vasa was a Swedish warship constructed in Stockholm, it was designed and built by Dutch shipwrights. In the early 17th century, the Dutch rose to prominence as the premier shipbuilders in Europe. The quality of Dutch-built vessels were renowned and Dutch shipwrights were hired to build the merchant fleets and navies throughout Europe.” Source: Kelby James Rose, The Naval Architecture of Vasa, a 17th Century Swedish Warship at 8 (doctoral dissertation submitted to the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies of Texas A & M University — 2014).\n\n“Despite his pivotal role in the construction of Vasa and eminence as a royal shipbuilder, little is known about Henrik Hybertsson. He was born in the Netherlands . . . [and] in the early 1600s, Hybetsson moved to Sweden where he was commonly referred to as Master Henrik. . . . By the time he entered into the Stockholm shipyard contract, he was likely one of the most experienced shipwrights in Sweden. . . . Hybertsson eventually moved to Stockholm . . . [and] in 1621, Master Henrik joined the contract held by Anton Monier for operation of the Stockholm shipyard. Along with his partner Arendt de Groot, Hybertsson signed a new contract in January of 1625 and that was scheduled to take effect in January 1626. Hybertsson was likely concerned primarily with organizational and administrative matters of the shipyard and left most practical construction matters to two other shipwrights in his employ, Henrik Jacobsson and Johan Isbrandsson (both Dutch). . . . Master Henrik’s health began to deteriorate in 1625. In the summer of 1626, he handed practical responsibility for the operation of the shipyard to his chief assistant Henrik Jacobsson who would oversee the completion of Vasa. Hybertsson was bedridden by the end of 1626 and died in the late spring of 1627.” (Source: Rose dissertation at 45-46.)\n\n“Although Vasa was the largest naval architecture project of Henrik Hybertsson’s life, this was not the case with Henrik Jacobsson. Following Vasa’s sinking, Jacobsson went on to build at least three more large and successful warships. . . . All three of Jacobsson’s warships had successful careers.” (Source: Rose dissertation at 318.)\n\nIn an academic article by, Richard E. Fairley, a faculty member at the Oregon Graduate Institute School of Science and Engineering, Mr. Fairley wrote about Vasa’s sinking:\n\n“Around 4:00 PM on August 10th, 1628 the warship Vasa set sail in Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage as the newest ship of the Royal Swedish Navy. After sailing about 1,300 meters, a light gust of wind caused the Vasa to heel over on its side. Water poured in through the gun portals and the ship sank with a loss of 53 lives. The Vasa lay in shallow waters off Stockholm harbor (at 32 meters depth) and after initial attempts to salvage it failed, was largely forgotten until it was located by Anders Franzen in 1956. In 1961, 333 years after it sank, the Vasa was raised and was so well preserved that it could float after the gun portals were sealed and water and mud were pumped from it.” Source: Richard E. Fairley, Why the Vasa Sank: 10 Lessons Learned at 1.\n\nAuthors Lars-Ake Kvarning and Bengt Ohrelius described Vasa’s maiden voyage:\n\n“Between three and four in the afternoon of Sunday August 10th, Captain Sofring Hansson gave orders to cast off. Slowly, the Vasa was towed out from her place by the crane. Her maiden voyage had begun. In calm and lovely weather, with a light south-west wind the Vasa was towed along Skeppsbron. The great lion figure-head, glowing in its colours, gazed grimly over towards the slopes of south Stockholm. Men were all ready at the handspikes round the great capstan to start their circular march to wind up the huge anchor hawser. The march began and as the anchor hawser curled in, the Vasa moved slowly forward. In one of the ship’s boats, a new anchor was already being rowed in for the next round. The road from the palace down to the water outside the heights of Soder is long considering the anchors, manpower and capstan. There were many people out and about in town, vespers were just over and the churches emptying. A large number of Stockholm’s roughly 10,000 people had come out to enjoy this late summer evening and to witness the ship’s departure. . . . Everything on board was secured and made ready to go to sea. All gun tackle was secured and belayed — only one small one pounder, called falkon, lying on deck and with no gun-carriage, was not secured. . . . The stern cable was cast off, the wind not strong, the south cliffs providing lee. With only four sails hoisted, the ship was moving quite slowly with scarcely any steerage-way. Then the wind increased slightly. Water began swirling round the bows and rippling faintly round the sturdy oak hull. The Vasa fired svensk losen (two shots). A fierce gust from the clifftops made the ship heel over, but then she straightened up again. Slowly, the Vasa slipped along the southern shores, the evening sun high above the lake Malaren, its rays giving lustre to the colours and gold of the richly decorated stern, the cliff still providing lee. . . . Beyond what was then the bay at Tegelviken, the wind was suddenly given much freer play and again a gust of wind from inland made the Vasa unexpectedly heeled fiercely over. All at once, she straightened up again, but this fierce careening had caused some uneasiness. The captain shouted through his megaphone that all men should immediately go to their stations, and he gave orders to loosen the topsail sheets. But the wind was not even strong enough to pull the new rope through their well-greased blocks and help was actually needed to ease them through. She heeled over again. The list was even greater this time, and water began rushing in through the open gun-ports. The list increased even further until the Vasa’s railing was in the water. Her moment of destiny had come. Just off Beckholmen, she went to the bottom at full sail, flags and all. . . . No one knows with any certainty how many people were on board. According to available crew recommendations, however, the crew on the Vasa should have consisted of 133 seamen. . . . It is said that old Captain Hans Jonsson was drowned and that Ordnance Master Erik Jonsson and the captain got away after being for a long time under water in great danger of their lives. No list has ever been found in any of the archives of those who were saved or those who died. At the most, fifty or so people probably died in the disaster. In the excavation after the salvaging, however, only skeletons and parts of skeletons of twenty-five people were found.”\n\nSource: Lars-Ake Kvarning and Bengt Ohrelius, The Vasa: The Royal Ship 18-22 (1972 — reprinted 2002). (Paragraphing omitted.)\n\nHere is another account of Vasa’s sinking:\n\n“On her maiden voyage on August 10, 1628, the Vasa sailed out of port and into Stockholm’s harbor. Les than a mile out, her sails filled with wind, and she fired a salute. A cheer went up from the assembled onlookers. Suddenly, she heeled sharply onto her port side. She righted herself briefly before heeling again. This time, water rushed into her gun ports, and she promptly sank to the bottom of the harbor. Sweden lost 50 lives that day, and the crown lost a fortune. The Vasa’s guns, carvings, and majestic trappings plummeted into 110 feet (33 m) of cold, Baltic water.”\n\nSource: Liz Mechem, Disasters at Sea: A Visual History of Infamous Shipwrecks 44 (2009).\n\nSINKING OF VASA\n\n(PAINTING CREDIT: NILS STODBERG)\n\nKing Gustav II Adolphus of Sweden was in Poland at the time of Vasa’s sinking. The King demanded that those responsible be punished for “imprudence and negligence.” After an inquiry, no one was found to be negligent or punished.\n\nAdmiral Baron Carl Carlsson Gyllenheim (1574-1650) was a half brother of King Gustav II Adolphus (1594-1632). Gustav II was the King of Sweden from 1611-1632.\n\nKING GUSTAV II ADOLPHUS — KING OF SWEDEN FROM 1611-1632\n\n(PAINTING CREDIT: JACOB HOEFNAGEL — NATIONAL PORTRAIT COLLECTION AT GRIPSHOLM CASTLE, STOCKHOLM)\n\nThe King may have been partially responsible for Vasa’s sinking. He insisted that the ship take up her station as the flagship of the Baltic fleet as soon as possible. Captain Hansson, the person with some responsibility for the construction of the ship, had warned Vice Admiral Flemming that the ship had stability problems. However, Captain Hansson and Vice Admiral Flemming were apparently too timid to discuss the ship’s structural problems with the King.\n\n“That the Vasa was launched with known stability problems is the result of poor communication, pressure from King Gustav to launch the ship as soon as possible, the fact that the King was in Poland conducting a war campaign, and because no one had any suggestions for making the ship more stable.” (Source: Fairley article at 5.)\n\n“During his reign, Gustav Adolf invested enormous administrative effort and capital into the growth and improvement of the Swedish military. The king viewed military strength as a primary tool to advance the position of Sweden within the Baltic and as a defensive strategy against potentially hostile neighbors. Gustav Adolph began a campaign of strengthening his navy in the mid-1620s, which included the construction of several large and heavily armed warships. The first of these was Vasa.” (Source: Rose dissertation at 15-16.)\n\nVasa was not the only large ship to sink on its maiden voyage. The list includes the RMS Titantic (British passenger liner that collided with an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912), the MS Georges Philippar (French ocean liner that caught fire and sank in the Gulf of Aden on May 15, 1932) and the SS John Morgan (World War II liberty ship that collided with a tanker and sank off the coast of Virginia on June 1, 1943).\n\n“The sinking of the Vasa was a major disaster for Sweden. The country was at war with Poland and the ship was needed for the war effort. No expense had been spared. The Vasa was the most expensive project ever undertaken by Sweden and it was a total loss. The ship’s captain survived the sinking and was immediately thrown in jail. On August 11th, the day after the disaster, a preliminary board of inquiry was convened. Incompetence of the captain and crew was ruled out and the captain was set free. A formal hearing was conducted in September 1628. No exact reason for the sinking was determined and no one was blamed.” (Source: Fairley article at 1.)\n\n“Preliminary hearings by state councillors on the accident began at Stockholm Palace the very next day [after Vasa’s sinking], to which the captain, who had only just escaped with his life, and the Master Shipbuilder of Holmen were both summoned. Captain Sofring had been taken into custody at the palace as soon as he had come ashore, but was released a few days later. On September 5th, a major enquiry was held at the palace by an especially arranged court consisting of seventeen people, of which six were state concillors. The Admiral of the Fleet, Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, acted as chairman. . . . The records of this major enquiry are preserved only i a fragmentary copy, but they nevertheless provide certain opportunities to assess the causes of the accident and a reconstruction of the trial. . . . The intention to try to find a scapegoat quickly is very clear. Not least with the knowledge of the severe punishments of the day, it is impossible not to feel pity for those involved in the drama. It is also understandable that the atmosphere must occasionally have been ominously tense.”\n\nSource: Book by Kvarning and Ohrelius at 25-26. (Paragraphing omitted.)\n\n“During the formal inquiry, several witnesses commented that the Vasa was ‘heavier above than below,’ but no one pursued the questions of how or why the Vasa had become top-heavy. There was no mention of the weight of the second deck, the guns, the carvings, or other equipment. In those days, most people (including the experts) thought the higher and more impressive a warship, and the more and bigger the guns it carried, the more indestructible it would be. (Source: Farley article at 4.)\n\nTechnical data of Vasa: Total length (including bowsprit) — 69.0 m; greatest width: 11.7 m; Draught: 4.8 m; total height at main mast: 52.5 m; height of sternship: 19.3 m; displacement: 1,210 tons; area of sail: 1,275 sq m; number of sails: 10; guns: 64, of which 48 24-pounders, eight 3-pounders and six mortars; crew: 145 men, 300 soldiers.\n\nSource: Book by Kvarning and Ohrelius at 31.\n\nIn 2011, a documentary was released on Vasa by Swedish director and screenwriter Anders Wahlgren. The film is titled Vasa 1628 — The People. The Ship. The Era. Books written about the Vasa include Carl Olof Cederlund, Vasa I, The Archaeology of a Swedish Warship of 1628 (F. Hocker ed. 2006); Fred Hocker, Vasa: A Swedish Warship (2011); Larso-Ake Kvarning and Bengt Ohrelius, The Vasa: the Royal Ship (1998); Hans Soop, The Power and the Glory: The Sculptures of the Warshipo Wasa (1986); Anders Franzen, The Warship Vasa: Deep Diving and Marine Archaeology in Stockholm (1974) and Lars-Ake Kvarning and Bengt Ohrelius, The Vasa: The Royal Warship (1972).\n\nOn May 31, 1564, the Swedish warship Mars sank during a naval battle with a Danish force allied with soldiers from Germany off the coast of Oland, a Swedish island. At the time, Mars was the largest and fiercest warship in the world. In 2011, a group of divers located the sunken ship in 246 feet (75 meters) of water.\n\n“During the day of sailing ships, Dalaro was Stockholm’s outer harbour. . . . But ships have been lost even in the sheltered harbour of Dalaro. In the summer of 1676, the man-of-war Riksapplet [Apple of the Realm] was wrecked in a south-westerly storm on a small skerry and sank at sixteen metres in depth. The little islet is today called Appelskar [Apple Skerry]. The Riksapplet had a crew of 500 men and carried 86 guns. Yet another ship was lost in Dalaro harbour. The same year as the Riksapplet sank, the Grone Jagaren [the Green Hunter] blew up and sank to the depth of thirty metres. . . . Inside Nybroviken in Stockholm lies the 44-gun ship Vastervik. She caught fire and sank there during the 1676 year of misfortune, when Sweden also lost the sea battle against the Danish-Dutch fleet at Oland. In dramatic circumstances, the great ship Kronan [the Crown] was lost with 850 men on board.”\n\nSource: Book by Kvarning and Ohrelius at 12-13. (Paragraphing omitted.)\n\nTIMELINE OF THE WARSHIP VASA\n\nWinter 1624-1625: King Gustav II Adolf signs a contract with Dutch master shipwright Henrik Hybertsson and his business partner, Arendt de Groote, to build four ship including Vasa.\n\n1626: Hybertsson becomes ill and can no longer supervise Vasa’s construction. Hybertsson’s assistant, Hein Jakobsson, takes over for Hybertsson.\n\n1627: Vasa is launched during the spring at Stockholm. Hundreds of craftsmen work through the summer to finish the hull and rigging.\n\nSummer 1628: Captain Sofring Hansson calls Vice Admiral Klas Flemming to report that he is worried about the stability of the ship. Admiral Flemming is afraid that the ship might sink at tbe quay. Under pressure from the King, Admiral Flemming orders Captain Hansson to carry on.\n\nAugust 10, 1628: On Vasa’s maiden voyage the ship sinks within sight of the shipyard after water gushes in through the open gun ports. Thousands of Stockholm residents witness the scene together with several foreign ambassadors.\n\nAutumn 1628: An inquest is conducted. It is concluded that the ship did not have enough hull to carry the heavy upper works. Hybertsson is blamed for the ship’s design. He cannot defend himself because he died the year before.\n\n1663-1665: Repeated efforts to raise the ship all fail. A team of divers led by Albrecht von Treileben and Andreas Peckell succeed in salvaging most of Vasa’s cannons. The divers use a recently perfected invention, the diving bell.\n\n1920: Brothers Simon and Leonard Olschanski apply for a permit to salvage ships sunk in Stockholm harbor. They plan to blow up the wrecks and to sell black oak, waterlogged wood, which is popular for use in Art Deco furniture. Their application is dened.\n\nAugust 1956: Anders Franzen’s crew drags Stockholm harbor. While dragging, an obstruction is found on the bottom in front of the island of Beckholmen.\n\nSeptember 1956: Per Edvin Falting, the Navy’s chief salvage diver, discovers Vasa standing upright on the bottom of the harbor.\n\nSeptember 1958: One of Vasa’s cannons is brought up from the deep. Per Edvin Falting becomes a media hero.\n\nAugust 1959: Vasa is lifted and moved in 18 stages. By September the ship lies at a depth of 17 meters by the island of Kastellholmen. Divers will spend another 1.5 years preparing the ship for the final lift.\n\nApril 24, 1961: Vasa is lifted to the surface. The event makes headlines throughout the world.\n\nFebruary 16, 1962: Vasa is displayed to the general public at the newly-constructed Wasa Shipyard. During 1962 nearly 440,000 people buy a ticket to see the ship and its contents.\n\nApril 1962: The operation begins to reconstruct and preserve Vasa. The ship is sprayed with polyethylene glycol PEG to prevent the ship from being destroyed. This treatment continues until 1979.\n\n1979-1989: The ship continues to dry. The drying process will go on for decades until the ship completely stabilizes.\n\n1989: The graves of 11 people who died when Vasa sank are opened after having been buried at the National Naval Cemetery in 1963. Research is conducted on the remains. Ten of these people become part of a special exhibit at Vasa Museum in 2004.\n\nJune 15, 1990: A museum is officially opened to display Vasa. The museum was designed by Swedish architects Hidemark Mansson Arkitekkontor AB.\n\nSummer 2000: It is feared that Vasa is in danger of dissolving away due to high humidity combining with sulphur in the wood to produce destructive acids. A new, state-of-the-art climate controlled facility becomes on line in 2004.\n\n2011: Vasa celebrates the 50th anniversary of its recovery from the depths. A records 1.2 million people visit the museum.\n\n(Timeline credit: Vasa Museum)\n\n“THE SINKING OF THE VASA”\n\n(PAINTING CREDIT: ANDREW HOWAT)\n\nRIDDARHOLMEN — WHERE MANY SWEDISH KINGS ARE BURIED\n\n(Photo Credit: Daniel Jonason)\n\nSwedish monarchs date back about 1,000 years under 11 dynasties. The current dynasty, the House of Bernadotte, has ruled the longest.\n\nSweden’s current king, King Carl XVI Gustaf, is the seventh monarch of the House of Bernadotte. He became the King in 1973, at age 23, when his father King Gustaf Adolph died. King Carl XVI Gustaf is married to Queen Silvia Sommerlath, a German-Brazilian who was born in Germany. The King and Queen live at Drottningholm Palace, which is just outside Stockholm.\n\nThe King of Sweden is the head of state but, under Sweden’s 1974 constitution, has no political affinity and no formal powers. The King’s duties are mainly of a ceremonial and representative nature.\n\nSome of the most famous Swedish monarchs were Gustav II Adolf (1622-1632), Kristina (1632-1654) and Gustav III (1771-1792). The Swedish government set forth short biographies on these three monarchs:\n\nGUSTAV II ADOLPHUS (GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS THE GREAT) — The Riksdag elected Gustav Adolphus king in 1523. By intervening in the Thirty Years’ War, Gustav II Adolph came to assume great political importance, and internationally is the best known of Sweden’s kings. Under his rule, Sweden became a leading military power. Gustav II Adolphus was killed in 1632 at the Battle of Lutzen, which was fought during the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648).\n\nBattle in the Thirty Years’ War. “The Protestant army, led by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, had advanced into southern Germany with 20,000 men. In September 1632, [General Albrecht von ] Wallenstein invaded Saxony with 30,000 men, threatening Gustavus’s lines of communication. Gustavus was forced to respond, marching north before entrenching to wait for reinforcements. At this point, Wallenstein split off a third of his army. Hearing this, Gustavus rushed to attack. The two armies made contact on the evening of 15 November, and spent the night drawn up in battle formation, with the Imperial army defending a ditched road. On the morning of the 16th, a mist delayed the start of the battle, and Gustavus was not able to attack until 11.00 am. Gustavus led a cavalry charge, which forced the Imperial musketeers from the ditch, and pushed the Imperial cavalry back. Wallenstein set fire to the town of Lutzen, and the smoke from the town temporarily blinded the Swedish center, which was then surprised by an Imperial cavalry charge. The line held, and was reinforced by Gustavus, who led his cavalry back to aid his center. At this point, the Protestant cause suffered a serious blow — Gustavus himself was killed during the cavalry fight that followed. Command was taken over by Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. At this point, the force that Wallenstein had detached earlier in the campaign, and had urgently recalled on the 15th, arrived on the battle field, and temporarily forced the Swedish army back across the ditched road. Despite this temporary setback, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar was able to force the Imperial troops to retreat into Lutzen, abandoning their artillery and baggage, before being forced to fall back on Halle The Imperial army lost 12,000 men, while the Swedes lost 10,000 men as well . . . .” Source: The Thirty Years War by C.V. Wedgewood (1938).\n\nThe phrase “Lutzendimma” (Lutzen fog) is still used in the Swedish language to describe thick fog.\n\n(King Gustavus Adolphus died at age 37. He is buried at Riddarholmen Church on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm.)\n\nTHE BATTLE OF LUTZEN — DEPICTING THE DEATH OF KING GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS\n\n(PAINTING CREDIT: CARL WAHLBOM)\n\nKRISTINA — Excepting the short caretaker government of Queen Ulrika Eleonora 1719-20, Kristina is the only female monarch of the modern Swedish kingdom. She succeeded Gustav II Adolf in 1632, just before her sixth birthday, and ruled for 22 years. Kristina abdicated in 1654, converting to Catholicism and settling in Rome, and was succeeded by her cousin, Karl Gustav. When he died in 1660, she traveled to Sweden in the hope of reclaiming the throne. Her claim was rejected by parliament, however, and Kristina returned to Rome. (She died at age 62. She is buried at St. Peter’s Basilica at Vatican City.)\n\nGUSTAV III — Usually called the Theatre King, Gustav III was a keen patron of the arts, and founded the first opera in Stockholm in 1782, the Swedish Academy and the Royal Academy of Music. His reign was not popular with the high nobility, however, and opposition culminated in a conspiracy in 1792, when he was shot at a masked ball held at the opera. He died shortly thereafter. (He died at age 46. He is buried at Riddarholmen Church.)\n\nGustav III legalized Catholic and Jewish presence in Sweden. In 1782, Gustav III was the first formally neutral head of state in the world to recognize the United States during its war for independence from Great Britain. It was said that Gustav III personally profited from the transatlantic slave trade. From 1789-90, Gustav III conducted a war with Russia known as the Russo-Swedish War of 1788-1790. The war involved the greatest naval victory ever achieved by the Swedish Navy. Russia lost one-third of its fleet and 7,000 men.\n\nAmong those involved in Gustav III’s assassination — about midnight of March 17, 1792 — were Jacob Johan Anckarstrom, Adolph Ribbing, Claes Fredrik Horn, Carl Pontus Lilliehorn and Carl Fredrik Pechlin. Upon entering the masked ball, Gustav III was surrounded by Anckarstrom and his co-conspirators. The conspirators were all wearing black masks and accosted him him French with the words: “Good day, fine masked man.” Anckarstrom used a pistol to shoot Gustav III in the left side of his back. The wound became infected and Gustav III died on March 29, 1792. His final words were: “A few moments of rest would do me good.” Anckarstrom was arrested and immediately confessed. Horn and Ribbing were also arrested and confessed. On April 27, 1792, Anckarstrom was executed by beheading. His right hand was cut off before he was executed. Anckarstrom’s family changed their name to Lowenstrom. The Lowenstrom family donated funds for a hospital as a gift of appeasement. This resulted in Lowenstrom Hospital — Lowenstromska Lasarettet — in Upplands Vasby north of Stockholm. Ribbing was sentenced to death but was pardoned and exiled to France. Pechlin died four years later in prison. Horn died in 1823 in Copenhagen. Lilliehorn was exiled to Germany where he assumed the name of Berg von Bergheim. The story of the assassination was the basis of Giuseppe Verdi’s 1891 opera “Un ballo in maschera,” translated into English as “A Masked Ball.” Author/playwright August Strindberg wrote a play about Gustav III’s assassination. It was adapted for Swedish TV in the 1970s.\n\nFrench origins of the Royal Family — A publication by the Swedish government notes that the Royal Family has French origins. The publication states:\n\n“Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was the first Bernadotte on the Swedish throne. Born in France in 1763, he was named heir to the Swedish throne in 1810. His name as king was King Karl XIV Johan. The Swedish Royal Family is related to all the reigning royal courts of Europe.”\n\nEric the Victorious (modern Swedish: Erik Segersall) was the first Swedish king about whom anything definite is known. He is from the “House of Munso” and is said to be the son of Bjorn Eriksson. He ruled from 970-995. He is sometimes referred to as King Eric V or VI based upon counting backwards from King Eric XIV (1560-68). He acquired the name “Victorious” because he defeated an invasion from the south in the Battle of Fyrisvellir located close to Uppsala. In all probability he founded the town of Sigtuna, which still exists and where the first Swedish coins were stamped for his son and successor, Olof Skotkonung.
