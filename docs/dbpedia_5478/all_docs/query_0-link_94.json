        "text": "Stockholm is a stylish and civilised city with great shopping, restaurants and hotels. During the day, you can explore this archipelago city, connected by 57 bridges, by bicycle or foot and at night, you should soak up the atmosphere in one of the many designer bars springing up in the Swedish capital. It's perfect for a weekend break.\n\nWhere to stay in Stockholm\n\nBERNS\n\nEveryone from Robbie Williams to the Dalai Lama has checked in to Berns' boutique bedrooms, which are well-placed near the Opera House, the best shops and great nightlife. Bistro Berns and Berns Asian, the in-house restaurants, serve excellent food. Beware of the cabin-style rooms: their large skylights allow guests from rooms higher up to peer down on you. £\n\nNäckströmsgatan 8, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 566 32200; berns.se).\n\nHOTEL BIRGER JARL\n\nBuilt in 1974, the hotel has been revamped to become a showcase for Swedish design. The lobby doubles as an exhibition space for local artists, while 12 local designers have been roped in to create suites and bedrooms. Rates include breakfast, discounts at several local shops and restaurants, and free entrance to Kulturhuset and the National Museum of Fine Arts. ££\n\nTulegatan 8, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 674 1800; birgerjarl.se).\n\nHOTEL ESPLANADE\n\nOverlooking the harbour on one of the classiest streets in town, Esplanade is close to all the most fashionable Östermalm shops. This is a wonderfully unfashionable, cosy, family-owned hotel with typically Swedish furniture. Bright Josef Frank fabrics from Svenskt Tenn, Sweden's swankiest design company, adorn the interiors. The hotel attracts a varied crowd, from tourist to business travellers, plus the occasional actor appearing at the nearby Dramaten theatre. Original mid-century modern Scandinavian furniture furnishes many of the hotel's 34 bedrooms. There is no restaurant, but the hotel serves a buffet breakfast and provides sandwiches on request. ££\n\nStrandvägen 7a, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 663 0740; hotelesplanade.se).\n\nHOTEL J GASHAGA\n\nA simple but stunning waterfront property which is perpetually flooded with light and peopled with friendly staff. The 13 bedrooms have a rustic, Ralph Lauren-on-sea charm, making use of heavy linens and light woods, while the sitting room, called the Yacht Club, has armchairs to sink into and sailing memorabilia on the walls. Best of all is the soaring, glass-walled restaurant, where the fire is kept stacked with birch logs all day.\n\nVärdshusvägen 14-16, Lidingö, Stockholm (00 46 8 601 3410; hotelj.com).\n\nNORDIC LIGHT HOTEL\n\nThis cool, pale designer hotel has 175 rooms and friendly, helpful staff. The lobby bar Light Bar & Lounge is a trendy, casual after-work hangout. Each bedroom has images resembling glowing sea-anemones projected onto the walls. £\n\nVasaplan, Vasastaden, Stockholm (Tel: 00 46 8 505 63000; nordiclighthotel.se).\n\nRICA HOTEL KUNGSGATAN\n\nA central hotel with pleasant blond-wood furnishings. The hotel is located in department store PUB, and is close to all good shopping. £\n\nKungsgatan 47, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 723 7220; rica.se).\n\nRIVAL HOTEL\n\nBenny from ABBA is breathing new life into Stockholm's hotel scene with this hotel-café-bakery-cinema. Originally opened in 1937, the Rival has been reinvented, preserving two Art Deco treasures: a circular bar in the lobby and a sumptuous, red-velvet cinema that cries out for a Garbo retrospective. The 99 bedrooms are decorated in a modern Scandinavian style, with wooden floors, panelled walls and cosy beds. Wall-mounted, flatscreen TVs and DVD players are handy for when you aren't out exploring the nightlife of Södermalm, the trendy southern island. The lobby bar is more architecturally than atmospherically appealing, but thanks to the first-class café and bakery, it is a local hub. £\n\nMariatorget 3, Södermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 545 78900; rival.se).\n\nSTALLMASTAREGARDEN\n\nLocated next to the huge Haga park with beautiful views over a lake but only 10 minutes' drive from the city centre, Stallmästaregården is a rustic and romantic hotel popular with Stockholmers who want a slap-up meal and an overnight stay. The 49 bedrooms were added to the original inn in 2000; thanks to the Italian owner, many have cappuccino machines. Classic Swedish cuisine is served in the dining room. £\n\nNorrtull, Vasastaden, Stockholm (00 46 8 610 1300; stallmastaregarden.se).\n\nTHE GRAND HOTEL\n\nAcross the water from the royal palace stands this mighty old aristocratic hotel, dating back to the last quarter of the 19th century. The hotel lives up to its name, with rich furnishings, rich food and rich guests. There are 376 rooms, some with views of the glorious waterfront, and several excellent restaurants. The new Princess Lilian suite takes up the top floor and has a cinema. Superchef Mathias Dahlgren's two-part restaurant Matsalen (The Dining Room) and Matbaren (The Food Bar) seem set to get at least one Michelin star. The beautiful Cadier Bar serves brunch and afternoon tea. ££\n\nSödra Blasieholmshamnen 8, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 679 3500; grandhotel.se).\n\nTHE VICTORY HOTEL\n\nSlap in the middle of Gamla Stan (the Old Town), the Victory plays up to the Stockholm's nautical obsession: each of the 45 ship-shape rooms are named after a Swedish sea captain. The restaurant is highly regarded and maintains one of the best cellars in Sweden. Lilla Nygatan 5, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 506 40000; thecollectorshotels.se). You could also try its slightly less expensive sister hotels, the Lady Hamilton (00 46 8 234 680; thecollectorshotels.se) and the Lord Nelson (00 46 8 232 390; thecollectorshotels.se). ££\n\nCOTTAGES IN THE ARCHIPELAGO DESTINATION STOCKHOLMS SKARGARD\n\nCottages and chalets can be rented by the week, for 1,500 SEK-15,000 SEK (about £100-£1,000) depending on size and facilities, such as private swimming pools.\n\n(00 46 8 5424 8100; dess.se).\n\nWhere to eat out in Stockholm\n\nCAFES\n\nSwedes have a passion for coffee, and spending time in cafés has its own verb: fika. There are good cafés and bars almost everywhere so don't miss the opportunity to relax - alfresco in the summer and inside during winter - in true Stockholm style.\n\nCAFE FOAM\n\nA modern café with slightly macaroon-looking stools, Foam serves great coffee along with breakfast, brunch, lunch and light dinners.\n\nKarlavägen 75, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 660 0996; cafefoam.com).\n\nCHAIKANA\n\nSwedes like their coffee, but tea here is usually poison. Thankfully colonial-style Chaikana has more than 200 black, green and white teas, plus French pastries and English scones. Perfect for a break after visiting the German church next door.\n\nSvartmangatan 24, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 244 500; chaikhana.se).\n\nROSENDALS TRADGARDSCAFE\n\nThis is a lovely place in the Djurgården park where you munch organic lavender biscuits or cinnamon rolls under the apple trees. The café's recipe book was an instant bestseller when it was published a few years ago, and it is easy to see why. You'd be a fool not to buy a loaf of bread as you leave. Open Tue-Sun, Feb-Dec.\n\nRosendals trädgård, Djurgården, Stockholm (00 46 8 662 2814; rosendalstradgard.se).\n\nSTORTORGETS KAFFESTUGA\n\nThe best café in Gamla Stan (the Old Town) if you crave proper hot chocolate. You should also try the chocolate and oatmeal balls (a Swedish classic), delicious blueberry pie with custard, or breakfast on porridge and a stout salami sandwich. For lunch, you'll find potato pancakes with bacon and lingonberries. Open from 7am weekdays; 9am weekends.\n\nStortorget 22, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 205 981).\n\nVETE-KATTEN\n\nVete-Katten is a sprawling café that occupies an entire block of this shopping district. The draw here are the celebrated hand-made chocolates and the café's speciality - a French mousse cake.\n\nKlara Norra Kyrkogata 26, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 208 405; vetekatten.se).\n\nRESTAURANTS\n\nBAKFICKAN\n\nBakfickan (The Back Pocket) is adjacent to the Opera Bar and Operakällaren (see below). The restaurant serves Swedish classics such as meatballs in gravy and mashed potatoes, and the staff are lovely.\n\nJakobs Torg 12, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 676 5800; operakallaren.se).\n\nCARLSHALLS GARD\n\nAn opulent dining room awaits in this modest 19th-century mansion house on Långholmen, a small island between Södermalm and Kungsholmen. Långholmen used to house a prison and the mansion house, which was built by the prison governor, is the closest you will come to rural beauty in Stockholm. The food is seasonal and traditionally Swedish. Come during autumn or winter, and you might just find elk on the menu.\n\nLångholmen, Södermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 668 0710; carlshallsgard.se).\n\nDEN GYLDENE FREDEN\n\nThe Swedish Academy has been meeting in this inn from 1722 in Gamla Stan once a week for decades. It was perhaps after a candlelit meal of Baltic herrings, fillet of reindeer with juniper and lingonberry ice cream that they decided to award the Nobel Prize for Literature to Pearl S. Buck in 1938. Gyllene Freden is a great place to sample Swedish history.\n\nÖsterlånggatan 51, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 109 046; gyldenefreden.se).\n\nDJURET\n\nDjuret (meaning 'The Animal') would be a vegetarian's nightmare. Every week it pairs a different meat with a suitable wine: reindeer & Côtes du Rhône, for instance, or Cow & Chardonnay.\n\nIn the Victory Hotel, Lilla Nygatan 5, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 506 400 84; djuret.se).\n\nEAST\n\nA modern Asian restaurant, and one of the best of its kind in Sweden, East serves daily specials for lunch, along with Japanese-infused courses for dinner. A sushi and sashimi menu is also available.\n\nStureplan 13, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 611 4959; east.se).\n\nFREDSGATAN\n\nCal-Ital meets Northern Lite at Fredsgatan 12. The result is peculiar - but brilliant - unlikely combinations of tastes. Owners Danyel Couet and Melker Andersson aspire for Fredsgatan to be Sweden's most modern and coolest luxury restaurant, and have been awarded a Michelin star.\n\n12 Fredsgatan 12, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 248 052; f12.se).\n\nLASSE I PARKEN\n\nA fantastic summer restaurant, Lasse i Parken has a lovely garden with tables for 180 guests. The listed building hails from 1730 and the menu mixes traditional Swedish and Mediterranean food.\n\nHögalidsgatan 56, Södermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 658 3395; lasseiparken.se).\n\nLISA ELMQVIST\n\nThis fish restaurant, named after its owner, is a fantastic place for lunch. Specialising in fresh fish and seafood, lunch is served until 5.30pm and you don't need to book a table. Order Toast Skagen, a beer, coffee and homemade truffles.\n\nÖstermalms Saluhall, Östermalmstorg, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 533 40 400; lisaelmqvist.se).\n\nMATTIAS DAHLGREN AT GRAND HOTEL\n\nRenowned Swedish chef Mattias Dahlgren, who was awarded a Michelin star for Bon Lloc in the late 1990s, has created two restaurants for Grand Hôtel - the informal Matbaren (The Food Bar) and the formal Matsalen (The Dining Room). The menus for both are created around regional produce and mixes Swedish and international cuisine.\n\nSödra Blasieholmshamnen 6, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 679 35 84; mdghs.com).\n\nOAXEN KROG\n\nThere's no mystery about why people make the hour-long drive south from Stockholm to the island of Oaxen: Oaxen Krog is one of Sweden's finest restaurants. Over the past 15 years, Magnus Ek and Agneta Green have transformed it from rustic to remarkable. The menu takes note of current global trends: the crispy pig's-ear starter; the artful use of foam, gel and jelly; the unexpected ingredients, such as the smudge of seaweed purée beneath the scallop-and-kid tartare. Magnus catches the fish and forages for other ingredients, from wild garlic to lichen. Despite its international reputation, it couldn't be more local.\n\nMörkö, near Stockholm, Sweden (00 46 8 551 53105; oaxen.com).\n\nOPERAKALLAREN\n\nOnce famous for its lunchtime smorgasbord, Operakällaren is now only open in the evening. The change may have offended traditionalists, but the Michelin men approved, awarding chef Stefano Catenacci a star. Superb haute cuisine with a Scandinavian accent (chilled pea soup with crabmeat and bleak roe; fried char with potato and onion gâteau and horseradish cream; warm cloudberry soufflé) is served in fin-de-siècle gilded interiors. Jacket and tie required (and you may have to sell your shirt to pay the bill).\n\nOperahuset, Jakobs Torg 2, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 676 5800; operakallaren.se).\n\nPONTUS!\n\nAfter leaving his well-known Pontus in the Greenhouse restaurant in 2007, chef Pontus Frithiof moved his staff to this Norrmalm gem, where you'll find an oyster bar, a cocktail bar with Asian finger food, and Matsalen, the main restaurant. The menu is split in three parts - Harvest (vegetables), Catch (fish and seafood) and Season (the produce that is best right now). The interiors fuse minimalist Scandinavia with Japan. Open Mon-Sat.\n\nBrunnsgatan 1, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 545 273 00; pontusfrithiof.com).\n\nRESTAURANG J\n\nThis airy and modern restaurant on the waterfront is 25 minutes from central Stockholm by water-taxi. Sit out on the deck to eat stylish brasserie food (saffron risotto with grilled lobster, prawns and scallops) and watch the yachts sail by.\n\nAugustendalsvagen 52, Nacka Strand, Stockholm (00 46 8 601 3025; restaurantj.com).\n\nSTUREHOF\n\nSturehof is a classic Stockholm restaurant with more than 100 years in the business. The food is fine and the focus is on seafood. Reservations are essential.\n\nSturegallerian, Stureplan 2, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 440 57 30; sturehof.se).\n\nVILLA KALLHAGEN\n\nA favourite of Swedish food writers, Villa Källhagen serves Scandinavian specialities on a terrace overlooking former royal hunting grounds.\n\nDjurgårdsbrunnsvägen 10, Djurgården, Stockholm (00 46 8 665 0310; kallhagen.se).\n\nWEDHOLMS FISK\n\nOne of Scandinavia's finest seafood restaurants, Wedholms' white walls are hung with large modern canvases and the food is equally stylish. Dishes include sweet pickled herring with dill and browned butter; scallops with salmon roe and tarragon; marinated salmon with mustard potatoes and pickled cucumber. Closed at weekends during the summer.\n\nNybrokajen 17, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 611 7874; wedholmsfisk.se).\n\nThe best nightlife in Stockholm\n\nBERNS SALONGER\n\nA legendary music hall that host concerts as well as club nights.\n\nBerzelii Park, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 566 322 22; berns.se).\n\nKVARNEN\n\nA legendary Södermalm restaurant and bar, which hasn't forgotten the borough's working class roots, Kvarnen is housed in a beautiful fin de siecle building and you can choose to take your drink alfresco during the warm summer months.\n\nTjärhovsgatan 4, Södermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 643 0380; kvarnen.com).\n\nLE BAR ROUGE\n\nWith its banquettes and acres of scarlet velvet, Le Bar Rouge looks like a corner of fin-de-siècle Paris. It is the creation of the team behind several Stockholm hotspots (F12, Kungsholmen, Grill); good for late-night drinks, it also serves one of the city's best burgers.\n\nÖsterlånggatan 17, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 505 244 60; lerouge.se).\n\nNALEN\n\nWhen talking about legendary places, Nalen shouldn't be forgotten - it has played host to several jazz legends over the years. Today, people come here for concerts and club nights. Pay a visit to the restaurant where you'll find some classic Swedish food.\n\nRegeringsgatan 74, Norrmalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 505 292 00; nalen.com).\n\nRICHE\n\nA very fashionable bar, Riche is frequented by the rich, famous and very stylish. The restaurant serves traditionally Swedish food, whereas the bar is extremely vibrant and modern.\n\nBirger Jarlsgatan 4, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 8 545 035 60; riche.se).\n\nSPY BAR\n\nAlso a celebrity favourite, Spy Bar is a genuine nightclub with good and varying music. Popular with partygoers, it should be avoided if you'd prefer talking to dancing. The queue is legendary.\n\nBirger Jarlsgatan 20, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 545 076 55; spybar.se).\n\nSTURECOMPAGNIET\n\nProbably the most famous club in Sweden, Sturecompagniet is made up of four rooms over two floors and is popular with 23-30-year-olds.\n\nSturegatan 4, Östermalm, Stockholm (00 46 8 545 076 00; stureplansgruppen.se).\n\nTRANAN\n\nA bit further north, Tranan is another Stockholm classic that offers great drinks and fantastic bar food (most of the menu is very Swedish). The bar has rotating DJs and the music ranges from Brazilian jazz to 70s funk and deep house.\n\nKarlbergsvägen 14, Vasastaden, Stockholm (00 46 8 527 281 00; tranan.se).\n\nWhat to see in Stockholm\n\nBUILDINGS AND MONUMENTS\n\nKUNGLIGA SLOTTET\n\nDestroyed by a fire in 1697, the Swedish royal palace was redesigned by architect Nicodemus Tessin. The impressive building is influenced by Italian, French and Swedish architecture and, although the palace is no longer the official residence of the king, it is still used as a regular venue for official functions. The exquisite interiors should not be missed; make sure you pay a visit to Karl XI's gallery, which was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The palace also houses the silver coronation throne of Queen Kristina and two museums, which are filled with interesting artefacts and serve to illuminate the palace's history. Tourists gather at midday for the changing of the guard in the Outer Courtyard.\n\nSlottsbacken 1, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 402 61 30; royalcourt.se).\n\nRIDDARHOLMSKYRKAN\n\nThis 16th-century church houses the burial vaults of all the Swedish monarchs (with two exceptions; Queen Kristina, who abdicated, converted to Catholicism and is buried in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, and Gustav VI Adolf, who is buried by Stockholm's Haga castle).\n\nRiddarholmen, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 402 61 30; royalcourt.se).\n\nSTADSHUSET\n\nStadshuset, the city hall, is one of Stockholm's most easily recognised buildings. It opened its doors to the public in 1923, and is a testament to early 20th-century architecture in Sweden. The lavish interiors, to which many famous Swedish artists have contributed, provide the setting for major events in the Stockholm calendar, including the famous Nobel Prize ceremony. The Blue Hall should not be missed.\n\nHantverkargatan, Kungsholmen, Stockholm (00 46 8 508 29 058; stockholm.se).\n\nSTORKYRKAN\n\nStorkyrkan has entered history as the church from where Olaus Petri preached the Lutheran doctrine that led to the reformation of the Swedish church in the 16th century. The church's architecture spans 700 years, and Storkyrkan is definitely worth a visit. The cathedral is home to a number of interesting artefacts, including a late-Gothic sculpture of St George and the Dragon.\n\nStortorget 1, Gamla Stan, Stockholm (00 46 8 723 30 00; stockholmsdomkyrkoforsamling.se).\n\nMUSEUMS\n\nDROTTNINGHOLM\n\nThe beautiful Drottningholm palace, located on the island of Lövön, is the residence of the Swedish royal family. The palace has opened a selection of its doors to the public, and among the rooms available for viewing is the beautiful Queen Lovisa Ulrika's library. You should also visit the palace church, the baroque garden and the palace theatre, where a popular opera festival is held every summer.\n\nDrottningholm, Stockholm (00 46 8 402 62 royalcourt.se).\n\nMODERNA MUSEET\n\nIf modern art is what you crave, then make your way to the Moderna Muséet. The collection dates from 1900 to today, and covers paintings, photography and film. There are a number of must-see exhibits, including The Child's Brain by Giorgio de Chirico, an Italian artist whose work is widely regarded as a precursor to the Surrealists.\n\nSkeppsholmen, Stockholm (00 46 8 5195 5200; modernamuseet.se).\n\nNATIONALMUSEUM\n\nNationalmuseum, a grand and opulent space designed by German architect August Stuler, is home to over 500,000 paintings dating from the 18th century to the early 20th century. Among the museums gems is a collection of Rembrandt sketches, Alexander Roslin's The Lady with the Veil, and Cupid and Psyche by the great 18th-century sculptor John Tobias Sergel.\n\nSödra Blasieholmshamnen, Stockholm (00 46 8 5195 4300; nationalmuseum.se).\n\nSKANSEN\n\nSkansen is a museum with a twist: it opened in 1891 with the aim of providing an insight into how people lived pre-industrialisation and is entirely open-air (the first open-air museum in the world, in fact), with over 100 buildings from all over Scandinavia erected on the plot. Regular festivals and concerts are also held there throughout the year. Visit during summer, and you might just catch a glimpse of Allsång på Skansen - an open-air mass sing-along.\n\nDjurgården, Stockholm (00 46 8 442 80 00; skansen.se).\n\nVASAMUSEET\n\nThe Vasamuseet, one of the most visited museums in Scandinavia, is home to all things maritime. Its most popular exhibit is the restored 17th-century royal warship Vasa, which sank on its maiden voyage and is decorated with over 700 ornate figures and ornaments.\n\nGalärvarvsvägen 14, Stockholm (00 46 8 519 548 00; vasamuseet.se).\n\nPARKS\n\nHAGA\n\nAn English park in Sweden, Haga is located in a Stockholm suburb and was created by King Gustav III in the 1770s. The king was murdered in 1792, before the palace he was building in the park had been completed, and it has since never been finished. A beautiful park in the summer, Haga has a famous house filled with butterflies from all over the world.\n\nHagaparken, Solna, Stockholm.\n\nKUNGSTRADGARDEN\n\nKungsträdgården, known to many as Stockholm's open-air living room, is the oldest park in the capital. In the summer, it plays host to theatre performances, concerts and food festivals, and transforms into a winter wonderland, complete with skating rink, for the later months of the year.\n\nKungstädgården, Norrmalm, Stockholm.\n\nThings to do in Stockholm\n\nOUT OF TOWN\n\nLAKE MALAREN\n\nIf you fancy venturing further a field, Lake Mälaren is a must. With beautiful islands scattered across an expanse of still waters, Mälaren is the perfect escape for a city break holiday. Visit the town of Mariefred and stop off at the Gripsholms Slott, a beautiful Renaissance period building built for King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century.
