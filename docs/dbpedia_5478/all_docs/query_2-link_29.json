        "text": "Writing a list of top coffee houses for Vienna feels a bit like deciding on the best French wines. With rather a lot of good ones around, it’s often a matter of taste and personal preference.\n\nBut I canvassed opinion among friends and relatives to come up with this list of cafés, which will grow as more suggestions come in.\n\nBook a culinary experience* for your Vienna trip\n\nSee also:\n\nLocal Viennese experiences\n\nCoffee house traditions\n\nSadly, it fell to me to work my way through all the below one-by-one, bravely consuming coffee and mountains of cake to bring you a local review of each establishment.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list by any means. But, in no particular order:\n\nCafé Central\n\n(The coffee house at Christmas)\n\nEasily spotted because of the queues that always seem to snake out from the entrance. Possibly the most famous of the Vienna coffee houses and much loved by tourists (hence the queues).\n\nTrotsky and Freud both supped at their drinks in this ground floor location in Palais Ferstel. (In fact, in 1913, they both lived in Vienna at the same time as Tito, Hitler and Stalin, which must have led to some awkward conversations in the supermarket queue.)\n\nI went into Café Central a skeptic and came out a believer; the interior architecture is truly wonderful.\n\nHerrengasse / Strauchgasse, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Hawelka\n\n(Be sure to try the Buchteln)\n\nA more homely alternative and famously the subject of one of Vienna’s best-loved songs, “Jö Schau” by the late Austrian songwriter Georg Danzer. The chorus includes the line, “What’s a naked man doing in Hawelka?” (Not something you’re likely to see today.)\n\nPop legend, Falco, celebrated his 30th birthday here, and other prominent guests have included Andy Warhol, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and Peter Ustinov. As I wrote in my review, the place is “as comforting as a pair of well-worn slippers”.\n\nPerhaps the most central of all the locations featured here: around halfway between Stephansdom cathedral and the Hofburg palace.\n\nDorotheergasse 6, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Sacher\n\n(Be sure to try the cake)\n\nAnother famous one easily spotted from the queue that commonly forms outside. The elegant decor carries echoes of palatial interiors and the view out the front windows looks fittingly 19th century (it’s opposite the Staatsoper opera house, opened in 1869).\n\nThis café is the natural home of the original Sachertorte cake and it kind of feels wrong to go inside without having a slice (or three). Or at least that was my excuse.\n\nPhilharmoniker Str. 4, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Sperl\n\n(Also famous for its recent TV appearances)\n\nOpened in 1880 and traditional home to archdukes, generals, artists and actors (the café is close to the Theater an der Wien opera house). Also known for its billiard tables and beautifully patterned upholstery.\n\nThere’s a feeling of Edwardian refinement about the place. Definitely one of my favourites…not least because it also appears in the Vienna Blood period detective series that features so many gorgeous city locations.\n\nGumpendorfer Straße 11, 1060 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Goldegg\n\n(Modern signs with a historical interior)\n\nA jewel away from the centre and with original Jugendstil décor (from 1910).\n\nPopular with locals, Goldegg is close to Upper Belvedere palace. So a place for a nice cup of coffee after a morning admiring the efforts of Klimt, Schiele and others.\n\nArgentinierstraße 49, 1040 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Prückel\n\n(I often have breakfast meetings here in the summer)\n\nFirst opened in 1903. It even has a theatre in the basement, reflecting the long association between coffee houses and the arts. Inside is a mix of Art Nouveau and 1950s “Mrs Maisel” design.\n\nThe café is a favoured haunt of students from the nearby University of Applied Arts. In summer, outdoor seating lines the side of the Prückel so you can enjoy fresh air along with your fresh coffee.\n\nStubenring 24, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Schwarzenberg\n\n(One of the oldest of Vienna’s coffee houses)\n\nQuite a lot has changed since Café Schwarzenberg opened its doors in 1861. Though I think one of the original waiters might still be there (and I mean that positively: a fine old gentlemen with the aura of a million served coffees).\n\nThe darker decor imbues the location with a certain attractiveness for dull and wet days, and the views of old town architecture justify finding a window seat.\n\nKärntner Ring 17, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nAd:\n\nCafé Mozart\n\n(Apparently a favoured haunt of the makers of The Third Man)\n\nThis one has quite a location, sandwiched between the Albertina Museum, State Opera House and Hotel Sacher. So you might describe it as rather central. Which is why queues are also not uncommon here.\n\nInside exudes a cosy, traditional ambience, despite the comings and goings of tourists dropping by to take a deserved breather from all the art and architecture.\n\nAlbertinaplatz 2, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Ritter\n\n(Located just off one of Vienna’s main shopping streets)\n\nAnother literary coffee house that traces its roots back to the 19th century. Known particularly for its inter-war interior design and neo-rococo ceilings.\n\nThe most famous guest was probably Austrian author, Peter Rosegger, who came *this* close to winning the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nMariahilfer Straße 73, 1060 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Jelinek\n\n(Another location with a particularly local feel)\n\nA coffee house like a worn sofa; comfortable, relaxing and leaders of the counter-revolution against the pristine approach of more museal cafés.\n\nSeemingly oblivious to trends and the passing of time, Café Jelinek is slightly off the beaten track, so less likely to be full of tourists (just full of Viennese). Oh, and expect piles of homemade cakes.\n\nOtto-Bauer-Gasse 5, 1060 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Schopenhauer\n\nA rather elegant combination of the old and the new. The interior evokes the early 20th century, while the ambience and service has a contemporary feel. What I describe as “Vienna in miniature” in my review.\n\nThe café has plenty of good things going for it, but deserves a special mention for a breakfast menu based on notable philosophers. The place to order an Immanuel Kant or a simple Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nStaudgasse 1, 1180 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Landtmann\n\n(Where high society goes to see and be seen)\n\nOpened in 1873 and located next to the Burgtheater and opposite city hall. So a common drinking hole for politicians and actors even today.\n\nNow the elegant flagship coffee house of a group of cafés, the Landtmann is notable for the large sheltered outdoor section and a jolly big and nice Christmas tree outside during the holiday season.\n\nBe warned if you’re a weak-willed cake lover: the café draws on the wider group’s rather excellent in-house patisserie.\n\nUniversitätsring 4, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Korb\n\n(Also a thriving event venue)\n\nA classic, but not in the “turn of the century” sense, thanks to the 1960s decor. A bustling little coffee house and a popular haunt for locals and those of an artistic disposition.\n\nAlso famous for its toilets (seriously) and a mere hop and a jump from Stephansdom cathedral.\n\nBrandstätte 9, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Museum\n\n(Conveniently placed for a quick coffee before or after a performance at the nearby Staatsoper)\n\nNewly refurbished in 2010 but originally designed by Adolf Loos in 1899. He was a regular guest along with other giants of art and architecture, such as Otto Wagner, Gustav Klimt, Franz Lehár, and Egon Schiele.\n\nEasily reached, since it practically has its own exit from the central Karlsplatz subway station.\n\nOperngasse 7, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nAd:\n\nCafé Frauenhuber\n\n(Notable for the strong composer connections)\n\nIf you’re looking for something with a very long tradition indeed, then Café Frauenhuber ticks all the boxes.\n\nOpened in 1824 in a building where Beethoven and Mozart used to perform. The street outside dates back at least to the 1300s. So, yes, quite a historical pedigree.\n\nHimmelpfortgasse 6, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Diglas Wollzeile\n\n(Look out for unusual and unexpected decorative touches)\n\nThe oldest site of the Diglas group on Wollzeile has the advantage of a particularly central location. The coffee house mixes tradition with a subtle dose of contemporary flair.\n\nFor example, Franz Lehár apparently used to drop in regularly, but the clock on the wall is now a digital projection. And that lovely glass chandelier has kitchen utensils hanging from it.\n\nWollzeile 10, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Diglas im Schottenstift\n\n(Coffee drinkers now sit where monks once roamed)\n\nI also find myself regularly popping into the Diglas im Schottenstift, which occupies premises within an abbey complex just off the historical Freyung square in central Vienna.\n\nThe staff always seem a tick more friendly than usual and the outdoor area within the abbey compound under the trees offers respite from the sun and busy sightseeing.\n\nSchottengasse 2, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Diglas am Fleischmarkt\n\n(Coffees been served on this site since 1875)\n\nAnother Diglas sits quietly just down from Stephansdom cathedral on the Fleischmarkt street, which features several historical buildings (look especially for some lovely Jugendstil designs).\n\nSpot the innovative coffee cup interior lighting inside. And the room at the back feels like a comfortable sitting room.\n\nFleischmarkt 16, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nKaffee Alt Wien\n\n(First opened in 1922)\n\nA mix of old and new, where flyers for the latest independent film or music festival sit close to a Renaissance portal.\n\nDespite the very central location, still away from the crowds with reasonably-priced coffee and an authentic atmosphere.\n\nBäckerstraße 9, 1010 Vienna | My full review\n\nCafé Westend\n\n(Reopened in 2023)\n\nThis one dates back to the late 1800s but was completely refurbished in 2018. It closed for another refurbishment before reopening with new owners in early summer, 2023 (as a coffee house by day and bar by night).\n\nAnother café with glorious ceilings, upholstered wall seating and broad windows for plenty of natural light. So not one of the dusky haunts of yore.\n\nThe Westend is handy for rail and subway travellers, since Westbahnhof station lies just over the road.\n\nMariahilfer Straße 128, 1070 Vienna | My full review\n\nSomething different?\n\n(I’m a fan of the Café-Konditorei Oberlaa on Neuer Markt. Always remarkably friendly and swift service)\n\nIf you’re all about the cakes with the coffee an afterthought, consider a Konditorei instead of a coffee house. As you can imagine, Vienna has quite a few\n\nIf you like the art and philosophy of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, then grab a coffee at Café Friedlich, located on the same premises that house the Hundertwasser Museum. Not your average café décor and accessible without a museum ticket\n\nIf it’s impressive ambience you want, then the cafés in the Naturhistorisches and Kunsthistorisches museums both come with magnificent interior architecture. Coffee and Caravaggio?\n\nTalking ambience, if you want a break while in the central Hofburg palace complex, consider the café in the giant pillared atrium of the Weltmuseum (also accessible without a museum ticket)\n\nIf the crowds at Schönbrunn get too much, Café Pavillon offers an escape: hidden behind the trees close to the palace and a bit of a local secret\n\nIf you’d like a rooftop view across the old town, then try the works canteen of the Supreme Court: open to the public in the Justizpalast\n\nAnd…how about afternoon tea instead of coffee? Gasp! Tea? What devilry is this? Begone foul fiend for even suggesting such a thing.\n\nActually, the lovely Haas&Haas tea rooms bring English and international tea culture to the very centre of Vienna. Never underestimate the power of a cucumber sandwich\n\nSomething past?\n\nThese are all places I’ve reviewed that have closed either completely or temporarily at the time of writing…\n\nCafé Ritter Ottakring\n\n(A genuine insider tip off the beaten tourist track)\n\nA hidden gem a little away from the centre. The Jugendstil décor inside makes you feel like the last hundred years never happened. Very popular with locals for card games and chess. And the menu is almost entirely locally sourced, too.\n\nClosed with no date given for reopening (at the time of writing), so check locally for the latest info. I’m hopeful this one makes a return as its a Viennese jewel.\n\nOttakringer Straße 117, 1160 Vienna | My full review\n\nSadly, no more…\n\nCafé Residenz: classic coffee house style with an imperial touch helped by its location in the Schönbrunn Palace outbuildings\n\n(A new Café-Restaurant run by the renowned and traditional Gerstner confectioner opened in its place in early 2024.)\n\nLandtmann’s Jausen Station: a more al fresco, modern experience in the gardens of Schönbrunn Palace during warmer seasons"
