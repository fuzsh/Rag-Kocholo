        "text": "Category Archives: Swedish Royals\n\nAncestors of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2023\n\nBoth of Crown Princess Victoria’s paternal grandparents were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Her paternal grandfather Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Västerbotten was the son of Princess Margaret of Connaught, the daughter of Queen Victoria’s son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught. Her paternal grandmother Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was the daughter of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria’s son Prince Leopold of the United Kingdom, Duke of Albany.\n\nOn the side of Victoria’s father King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, all her ancestors from the last six generations are royal except for one great-great-great-great-grandmother Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe who was a member of a Danish noble family descended illegitimately from King Christian V of Denmark and his mistress Sophie Amalie Moth. Among Victoria’s ancestors from the last six generations are monarchs of the current monarchies of Sweden and the United Kingdom and the monarchs of the former German monarchies of Anhalt, Baden, German Empire, Nassau, Prussia, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Schaumburg-Lippe, and Waldeck-Pyrmont.\n\nOn the side of her mother Queen Silvia, born Silvia Sommerlath in Heidelberg, Germany, Crown Princess Victoria has a German maternal grandfather, Walther Sommerlath, and a Brazilian maternal grandmother, Alice Soares de Toledo.\n\nParents, Grandparents, Great-Grandparents, Great-Great-Grandparents, and Great-Great-Great-Grandparents of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden (born July 14, 1977)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Kingdom of Sweden Index\n\nThe links below are from Unofficial Royalty, Wikipedia, Leo’s Genealogics Website, The Peerage, or Geni.\n\nParents\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden (born 1946)\n\nSilvia Sommerlath (born 1943)\n\nGrandparents\n\nPrince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Västerbotten (1906 – 1947)\n\nPrincess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1908 – 1972)\n\nWalter Sommerlath (1901 – 1990)\n\nAlice Soares de Toledo (1906 – 1997)\n\nGreat-Grandparents\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden (1882 – 1973)\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught (1882 – 1920)\n\nCharles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1884 – 1954)\n\nPrincess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1885 – 1970)\n\nLudwig Carl Moritz Sommerlath (1860 – 1930)\n\nErna Sophie Christine Waldau (1864 – 1944)\n\nArtur Floriano de Toledo (1873 – 1935)\n\nElisa de Novaes Soares (1881 – 1929)\n\nGreat-Great-Grandparents\n\nKing Gustaf V of Sweden (1858 – 1950)\n\nPrincess Victoria of Baden (1862-1930)\n\nPrince Arthur of the United Kingdom, Duke of Connaught (1850 – 1942)\n\nPrincess Louise Margaret of Prussia (1860 – 1917)\n\nPrince Leopold of the United Kingdom, Duke of Albany (1853 – 1884)\n\nPrincess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1861 – 1922)\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1855 – 1934)\n\nPrincess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1860 – 1932)\n\nCarl Ludwig Ernst Heinrich August Sommerlath (1834 – 1897)\n\nAnna Lucie Tille (1830 – 1898)\n\nJohann Friedrich Waldau (1828 – 1896)\n\nSophie Schmidt (1824 – 1911)\n\nJoaquim Floriano de Toledo (1842 – 1916)\n\nMaria Julia de Toledo Barros (1849 – 1914)\n\nEmiliano Batista Soares (? – 1914)\n\nJoaquina Dias de Novaes (1856 – 1916)\n\nGreat-Great-Great-Grandparents\n\nKing Oscar II of Sweden (1829 – 1907)\n\nPrincess Sophia of Nassau (1836 – 1913)\n\nFriedrich I, Grand Duke of Baden (1826 – 1907)\n\nPrincess Louise of Prussia (1838 -1923)\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1819 – 1861)\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819 – 1901)\n\nPrince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828 – 1885)\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Anhalt-Dessau (1837 – 1906)\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1819 – 1861)\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819 – 1901)\n\nGeorg Victor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1831 – 1893)\n\nPrincess Helena of Nassau (1831 – 1888)\n\nFriedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1814 – 1885)\n\nPrincess Adelheid of Schaumburg-Lippe (1821 – 1899)\n\nFrederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1829 – 1880)\n\nPrincess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1835 – 1900)\n\nJohannes Heinrich Philipp Sommerlath (1800 – 1884)\n\nMarie Philippine Meine (1806 – 1874)\n\nErnst Gottlieb Tille (1789 – 1860)\n\nCaroline Friederike Pröpping (1790 – 1852)\n\nJohann Friedrich Waldau (1795 – 1866)\n\nJohanne Marie Fricke (1828 – 1896)\n\nHeinrich Andreas Schmidt (1792 – ?)\n\nCatharine Marie Christine Prien (1797 – 1855)\n\nJoaquim Floriano de Toledo (1815 – 1874)\n\nMatildes Martins Aguiar de Campos (1815 – ?)\n\nFrancisco Antonio de Barros (1810 – 1863)\n\nGertrudes Eulália de Toledo (1829 – 1854)\n\nJoão Batista Soares (? – ?)\n\nVictória de Freitas e Silva (1791 – )\n\nJoaquim Dias Novaes (1823 – 1879)\n\nLucia Maria Brandina (1823 – 1916)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It is now a Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran national church in Sweden. Uppsala Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala, the Primate of Sweden.\n\nAt the end of the Viking Age (circa 793 – 1066), the Viking temple at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala) was replaced by a Christian church. The date of construction of the church at Gamala Uppsala is unknown but a Bishop of Uppsala was appointed in 1123. After the church was damaged by a fire, local church officials sought permission from Pope Alexander IV to build a larger church nearby. Permission was given with the condition that the location name of Uppsala would be preserved. A new site was chosen in nearby Östra Aros whose name was changed to Uppsala.\n\nConstruction started in 1272 on the site of an earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity. This earlier church is related to the story of Saint Erik IX of Sweden (reigned circa 1156 – 1160), Sweden’s patron saint who is buried at Uppsala Cathedral. Magnus Henriksson, a Danish lord and a claimant to the throne of Sweden, gathered an army near Östra Aros where Erik planned to attend Mass, in that earlier stone church, on the Feast of the Ascension, May 18, 1160. After Erik attended Mass, he armed himself, and with a few men, went out to meet Magnus’ troops. Erik was pulled off his horse by Magnus’ troops who stabbed him and then beheaded him. Magnus Henriksson reigned for a year as King Magnus II before he was killed.\n\nThe church was designed by unknown French architects who supervised the construction until 1281. Progress on the construction was slow because of the cold climate, the plague, and financial difficulties. In 1287, French master builder Étienne de Bonneuil and his assistants traveled to Sweden to work on the cathedral. By the end of the 14th century, the initial plans were completed. However, when the cathedral was consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, it still was not complete. The cathedral was dedicated to Saint Lawrence (one of the seven deacons of the city of Rome who were martyred in 258) Saint Eric IX of Sweden (the patron saint of Sweden although he was never canonized by the Roman Catholic Church), and Saint Olaf (the patron saint of Norway).\n\nOver the years, fire damage required some renovations. From 1885 – 1893, the architect Helgo Zettervall oversaw comprehensive restoration work, seeking to give the cathedral a French High Gothic appearance. He added pointed French spires to the towers and in an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls. He has been criticized for not respecting the cathedral’s original Brick Gothic style. Further renovation work from 1963 – 1977 led by Swedish architect Åke Porne (link in Swedish) improved the building’s structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of Zettervall’s cement additions to the exterior of the cathedral were removed.\n\n********************\n\nThe Shrine of Saint Erik IX of Sweden\n\nSaint Erik IX of Sweden is said to have been buried first in the church at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). In 1273, his remains were transferred to the new cathedral in Uppsala which was still under construction. The gilded silver casket that we see today was made in 1574 – 1579 by King Johan III of Sweden to replace an earlier casket that was melted down when he needed money.\n\nFrom 2014 – 2016, the remains in the shrine were examined. The researchers were 90% sure that the remains are those of Saint Erik IX of Sweden. Carbon-14 testing matched the date of Erik’s death and the manner of death fits the story of Erik’s death. The remains are from a person who died a violent death, probably decapitation. The remains also show that the person was about 35 years old at the time of his death, was strongly built, healthy, and physically active during his life.\n\n********************\n\nThe High Altar\n\nThe high altar is used for the cathedral’s most important services. It is also here that all Swedish bishops are ordained. The silver chandelier is from 1647. The large crucifix in silver and crystal was installed in 1976.\n\nThe altarpieces have changed over the years. From 1725 – 1731, Swedish-German furniture maker and sculptor Burchard Precht worked on a large Baroque altarpiece. It remained in Uppsala Cathedral until it was removed during Helgo Zettervall’s restoration at the end of the nineteenth century. At that time, Precht’s altarpiece was replaced by a neo-Gothic oak altarpiece designed by Swedish architect Folke Zettervall, Helgo Zettervall’s son. However, Precht’s altarpiece can still be seen at the high altar in the Gustaf Vasa Church in Stockholm.\n\nFolke Zettervall’s altarpiece was removed in 1964. It was replaced for several years by the Skånelaskåpet, a late medieval altar cabinet in oak, made in Brussels during the early 16th century, purchased for the Uppsala Cathedral from Skånela Church in 1912. The current altarpiece consists of a cross in silver and crystal. It was designed by Swedish architect Åke Porne, who led the 1963 – 1977 renovation of Uppsala Cathedral, and was made by Bertil Berggren-Askenström (link in Swedish), a Swedish sculptor and silversmith.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Pulpit\n\nThe ornate pulpit, the largest in Sweden, was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and carved by Swedish-German furniture maker and sculptor Burchard Precht. It was a gift from Queen Hedwig Eleonora, the wife of King Karl X Gustav, after the fire of 1702 and completed in 1710. Helgo Zettervall had the pulpit removed during the 1885 – 1893 renovation he led. He wanted to replace the Baroque masterpiece with a pulpit in the Gothic style. However, he did not have the funds for a new pulpit and so Precht’s pulpit returned to its place.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Restored Frescoes\n\nDuring the Reformation, the medieval frescoes on the walls and ceilings had been whitewashed. Many of these beautiful frescoes were uncovered and restored during Åke Porne’s 1963 – 1977 renovations.\n\n*******************\n\nCoronations\n\nFrom 1441 – 1719, all but three Swedish monarchs were crowned at Uppsala Cathedral.\n\nSeptember 14, 1441 – Christopher of Bavaria, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJune 29, 1448 – Karl Knutsson, King of Sweden and Norway, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJuly 2, 1448 – Katarina Karlsdotter, second wife of Karl Knutsson\n\nJune 29, 1457 – Christian I, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, crowned King of Sweden\n\nJuly 3, 1457 – Dorothea of ​​Brandenburg, wife of Christian I\n\nJanuary 12, 1528 – Gustav I Vasa, King of Sweden\n\nOctober 6, 1536 – Margareta Leijonhufvud, second wife of Gustav I Vasa\n\nJune 29, 1561 – Erik XIV, King of Sweden\n\nJuly 10, 1569 – Johan III, King of Sweden and his first wife Katarina Jagellonica of Poland\n\nFebruary 19, 1594 – Sigismund III Vasa, King of Sweden and his first wife Anna of Austria\n\nMarch 15, 1607 – Karl IX, King of Sweden and his second wife Christina of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nOctober 12, 1617 – Gustavus II Adolphus the Great, King of Sweden\n\nJune 6, 1654 – Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden\n\nSeptember 28, 1675 – Karl XI, King of Sweden\n\nMarch 17, 1719 – Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden\n\n*******************\n\nWedding\n\nOctober 1, 1536 – Gustav I Vasa, King of Sweden and his second wife Margareta Leijonhufvud\n\n*******************\n\nBurials\n\nExcept for Saint Erik IX, all the royal burials at Uppsala Cathedral are members of the family of King Gustav I Vasa. He was the first king of the House of Vasa and is considered the founding father of the modern Swedish state. During the Swedish War of Liberation (1521 – 1523), Gustav Vasa successfully deposed King Christian II from the throne of Sweden, ending the Kalmar Union between Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. On June 6, 1523, Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden by the Swedish Riksdag (legislature) and soon all Danish troops were driven out of the country. King Gustav I Vasa ranks among Sweden’s greatest monarchs and some argue that he was the most significant ruler in Swedish history. He ended foreign domination in Sweden, centralized and reorganized the government, cut religious ties to Rome, established the Church of Sweden, and founded Sweden’s hereditary monarchy.\n\nSaint Erik IX (circa 1120-1125 – 1160)\n\nKatharina of Saxe-Lauenburg (1513 – 1535), Gustav I Vasa’s first wife\n\nMargaret Leijonhufvud ( 1516 – 1551), Gustav I Vasa’s second wife\n\nKing Gustav I Vasa (1496 – 1560)\n\nKatarina Jagellonica of Poland (1526 – 1583) Johan III’s first wife\n\nKing Johan III (1537 – 1592), son of Gustav I Vasa\n\nGunilla Bielke (1568 – 1597) Johan III’s second wife.\n\nGustav of Saxe-Lauenburg (circa 1570 – 1597), Gustav I Vasa’s grandson\n\nElisabet Vasa of Sweden, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch (1549 – 1598), Gustav I Vasa’s daughter\n\nKaterina Stenbock (1535 – 1621), Gustav I Vasa’s third wife\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Originally, a Roman Catholic church, Stockholm Cathedral became a Lutheran church during the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. It is now a Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran national church in Sweden. The church has several names: Storkyrkan (in Swedish, stor = great and krykan = church, hence Great Church), Stockholms domkyrka (Stockholm Cathedral) and Sankt Nikolai kyrka (Saint Nicholas Church). In Sweden, it is most commonly called Storkyrkan.\n\nAccording to tradition, the first church on the site was dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra and was built in the 13th century by Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm A large donation to the church in 1346 by King Magnus IV of Sweden and his wife Blanche of Namur probably indicates the beginning of renovations and additions. After significant renovations and additions in the 14th and 15th centuries, the church reached its present size and shape as a five-aisled hall church in 1480. The church was originally built in the Brick Gothic style of the 13th century with a tower. From 1736 – 1742, Swedish architect Johan Eberhard Carlberg was employed to renovate the exterior and build a new tower. The exterior was transformed from a Gothic style to a Baroque style. The exterior seen today is still largely the result of Carlberg’s work.\n\nThe Baroque altarpiece over the main altar was made in silver and ebony by Hamburg goldsmith Eustachius Erdmüller and was completed in 1652. The central part is divided into three levels with each level containing a panel with a silver relief. The reliefs depict, from bottom to top, the Crucifixion, the Entombment, and Christ in the realm of the dead. Silver statuettes of Moses and John the Baptist flank the Crucifixion panel. The second and third panels are flanked by the Four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\n\nOn either side of the nave are the two royal pews. The lower part is a seating area enclosed by a decorated wooden barrier. Originally a throne was placed in each pew. The upper part of each pew is a gilt wooden canopy in the form of an oversize royal crown carried by angels against a background of imitated drapery. The royal pews, intended for the royal family, were designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and made by Swedish-German furniture maker and sculptor Burchard Precht.\n\nThe gilt wooden pulpit in the French Baroque style was also made by the sculptor Burchard Precht between 1698 and 1702.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive sight at Stockholm Cathedral is the wooden sculpture that depicts the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. The statue was commissioned by Sten Sture the Elder, Swedish statesman and Regent of Sweden from 1470 – 1497 and 1501 -1503, following his victory over the Danish army in the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471. During the battle, Sten Sture had prayed to Saint George to protect his army. The sculpture is attributed to Bernt Notke, one of the foremost artists in northern Europe at that time. The 12 feet/3.75 meters high statue depicts Saint George on horseback and stands on a wooden plinth, decorated with scenes from the legend of Saint George.\n\n*******************\n\nRoyal Events at Stockholm Cathedral\n\nOver the centuries, many royal events have occurred at Stockholm Cathedral. The list below does not purport to be complete.\n\nCoronations\n\nStockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan) along with Uppsala Cathedral and a few other churches have served as sites for the coronation of Sweden’s rulers. In 1873, King Oscar II was the last Swedish monarch to have a coronation. His son King Gustav V of Sweden (reigned 1907 – 1950) chose not to be crowned and his successors King Gustaf VI Adolf and King Carl XVI Gustav followed suit.\n\nJuly 31, 1336 – King Magnus IV of Sweden and his wife Blanche of Namur, Queen of Sweden\n\nNovember 26, 1497 – King Hans of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden was crowned King of Sweden\n\nNovember 4, 1520 – King Christian II of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden was crowned King of Sweden\n\nSeptember 24, 1531 – Katharina of Saxe-Lauenburg, Queen of Sweden, 1st wife of King Gustav Vasa I\n\nJuly 5, 1568 – Karin Månsdotter, Queen of Sweden, mistress and then wife of King Erik XIV\n\nNovember 28, 1620 – Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, Queen of Sweden, wife of King Gustavus II Adolphus the Great\n\nOctober 20, 1650 – Queen Christina of Sweden\n\nOctober 25, 1654 – Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, Queen of Sweden, wife of King Carl X Gustav\n\nNovember 25, 1680 – Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, Queen of Sweden, wife of King Karl XI\n\nDecember 14, 1697 – King Karl XII of Sweden\n\nMay 3, 1720 – King Fredrik I of Sweden\n\nNovember 26, 1751 – King Adolf Frederik of Sweden and his wife Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, Queen of Sweden\n\nMarch 29, 1772 – King Gustav III of Sweden\n\nMay 28, 1772 – Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, Queen of Sweden, wife of King Gustav III\n\nJune 29, 1809 – King Carl XIII of Sweden/King Karl II of Norway and his wife Hedwig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, Queen of Sweden and Norway were crowned King and Queen of Sweden\n\nMay 11, 1818 – King Carl XIV Johan of Sweden/King Karl III Johan of Norway was crowned King of Sweden\n\nAugust 21, 1829 – Désirée Clary, Queen Desideria of Sweden and Norway, wife of King Carl XIV Johan, was crowned Queen of Sweden\n\nSeptember 21, 1844 – Joséphine of Leuchtenberg, Queen Josefina of Sweden and Norway, wife of King Oscar I, was crowned Queen of Sweden\n\nSeptember 28, 1844 – King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway was crowned King of Sweden\n\nMay 3, 1860 – King Carl XV of Sweden/King Karl IV of Norway and his wife Louise of the Netherlands, Queen Lovisa of Sweden and Norway, were crowned King and Queen of Sweden\n\nMay 12, 1873 – King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and his wife Sophia of Nassau, Queen Sofia of Sweden and Norway, were crowned King and Queen of Sweden\n\nChristenings\n\nSeptember 27, 1977 – Christening of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nWeddings\n\nWedding of Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling, 2010\n\nSeptember 24, 1531 – King Gustav Vasa I of Sweden and his first wife Katharina of Saxe-Lauenburg\n\nJuly 4, 1568 – King Erik XIV of Sweden and Karin Månsdotter\n\nJune 19, 1823 – King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway and Princess Joséphine of Leuchtenberg\n\nJune 19, 1850 – King Carl XV of Sweden/King Karl IV of Norway and Princess Louise of the Netherlands\n\nMay 22, 1919 – Princess Margaretha of Sweden, granddaughter of King Oscar II, and Prince Axel of Denmark\n\nMay 24, 1935 – Princess Ingrid of Sweden, daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and the future King Frederik IX of Denmark\n\nJune 5, 1964 – Princess Désirée of Sweden, granddaughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and Baron Niclas Silfverschiöld\n\nJune 19, 1976 – King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Silvia Sommerlath\n\nJune 19, 2010 – Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling\n\nFunerals\n\nFuneral of King Gustaf VI Adolf, 1973\n\nMay 13, 1920 – Margaret of Connaught, Crown Princess of Sweden, first wife of the future King Gustaf VI Adolf\n\nFebruary 4, 1947 – Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Västerbotten, son of King Gustaf VI Adolf, father of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nMarch 13, 1965 – Queen Louise of Sweden (Lady Louise Mountbatten), second wife of King Gustaf VI Adolf\n\nSeptember 25, 1973 – King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish monarch although the actual residence of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia is Drottningholm Palace in Ekerö municipality on the island of Lovön in Lake Mälaren, west of Stockholm, Sweden. However, the offices of the Swedish monarch, other members of the Swedish royal family, and the Royal Court of Sweden are located at the Royal Palace.\n\nThe current palace was built on the site of the former Tre Kroner Castle (Three Crowns Castle), built in the 13th century, which was destroyed by fire in 1697. Construction began in 1697 and was completed in 1760. The Royal Palace was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. After Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the Royal Palace was completed by Swedish architect Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its interior.\n\n********************\n\nThe Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, which this writer has visited, is a church of the Church of Sweden, an Evangelical Lutheran church. It is the parish church for the members of the Royal Parish which comprises the Swedish royal family, employees at the court, and their relatives. Services are held every Sunday and on holy days, and the royal family uses the church for other ceremonies.\n\nBuilt during the 18th century along with the rest of the Royal Palace, the Royal Chapel was consecrated in 1754. The ceiling paintings and decorations have the theme of the Ascension of Jesus Christ and were the collaborative work of Swedish architect Carl Hårleman, French painter Guillaume Taraval and Swedish decorative artist Johan Pasch and French sculptors Jacques Philippe Bouchardon (link in French) and Charles Guillaume Cousin (link in Swedish).\n\nThanksgiving service in 2013 marking the 40th anniversary of King Carl XVI Gustaf’s accession to the throne. There is a good view of the pulpit on the right.\n\nThe pulpit was created in the years 1748 -1751 mainly by French sculptor Jacques-Philippe Bouchardon.\n\nJacques-Philippe Bouchardon had been working on an altarpiece but he died before it was completed. His replacement Swedish sculptor Pierre Hubert L’Archevêque damaged Bouchardon’s incomplete work out of rivalry and began his own altarpiece. L’Archevêque eventually tired of working on the altarpiece and it was completed in 1779 by Johan Tobias Sergel, one of Sweden’s greatest sculptors. The magnificent altarpiece depicts Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane.

It is the private residence of the Swedish royal family. Drottningholm Palace was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. When he died, his son Nicodemus Tessin the Younger continued his work and completed the interior designs. Construction began in 1696 and was completed in 1728. The palace grounds include a beautiful baroque garden and other gardens featuring numerous sculptures and statues, along with several fountains and water features.\n\nThe Royal Chapel, which this writer has visited, is on the northern end of Drottningholm Palace with an entrance leading directly into the palace. It is a church of the Church of Sweden, an Evangelical Lutheran Church. The building is completely round with three slightly protruding middle sections and is covered by a copper dome with windows topped by a lantern. The main entrance is located on the west side facing the gardens. The construction of the Royal Chapel was completed in 1728 and during the following years, Swedish architect Carl Hårleman oversaw the interior decoration work. The altarpiece depicting The Last Supper was done by the court painter Georg Engelhard Schröder. In 1730, the church was consecrated and it has been in continuous use since then. The altar is facing north, opposite the royal pew. The pews in the side aisles in the east-west direction were installed from 1910 – 1912.\n\nThe christening of Princess Leonore, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, in 2014\n\nThe local Lovön Parish conducts services in the chapel on the last weekend of each month. The Royal Chapel has been used over the years for regular worship and events by members of the Swedish royal family. Below is a list of some royal events that have occurred at the Royal Chapel at Drottningholm Palace.\n\nAugust 29, 1744 – Wedding of the future King Adolf Frederik of Sweden and Princess Louisa Ulrika of Prussia\n\nDecember 7, 1976 – Wedding of Prince Bertil of Sweden, Duke of Halland (son of King Gustav VI Adolf) and Lilian Craig\n\nSeptember 9, 2016 – Christening of Prince Alexander, Duke of Södermanland (son of Prince Carl Philip, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nDecember 1, 2017 – Christening of Prince Gabriel, Duke of Dalarna (son of Prince Carl Philip, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nJune 8, 2014 – Christening of Princess Leonore, Duchess of Gotland (daughter of Princess Madeleine, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nOctober 11, 2015 – Christening of Prince Nicolas, Duke of Ångermanland (son of Princess Madeleine, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nJune 8, 2018 – Christening of Princess Adrienne, Duchess of Blekinge )daughter of Princess Madeleine, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nAugust 14, 2021 – Christening of Prince Julian, Duke of Halland (son of Prince Carl Philip, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It is Stockholm’s oldest preserved building and was originally the monastery church for the Greyfriars Monastery, Stockholm founded in 1270 and built with funds donated by King Magnus III Ladulås who is interred in the church. After the Protestant Reformation, Riddarholmen Church became a Lutheran church. A spire was added during the reign of King Johan III of Sweden (reigned 1569 – 1592) but it was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1835 and was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.\n\nSince 1807, Riddarholmen Church has functioned solely as a burial and memorial church. It is maintained by the Office of the Marshal of the Realm and the National Property Board (SFV). The only regular services are a Christmas Day carol service organized by the Stockholm Scout Association and a Catholic Mass organized by the St. Eugenia Roman Catholic Church on June 7, the anniversary of Queen Josefina’s death in 1876. Born Joséphine of Leuchtenberg, Queen Josefina was a granddaughter of Empress Joséphine (Napoleon Bonaparte‘s first wife) from her first marriage to Alexandrede de Beauharnais, Vicomte de Beauharnais, who was guillotined during the French Revolution. Josefina remained Roman Catholic and was given a Catholic funeral.\n\n********************\n\nThe Order of the Seraphim\n\nThe Order of the Seraphim, established by King Fredrik I in 1748, is the senior order in Sweden. Awarded in only one class, Knight, it is almost exclusively given to members of the Swedish Royal Family and foreign heads of state. When a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim dies, his or her coat of arms is hung in Riddarholmen Chruch. On the day of the funeral, the bells of Riddarholmen Church are rung continuously from 12:00 noon until 1:00 PM. This bell ringing is called Serafimerringningen (Seraphim Ringing).\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Swedish Orders and Honours\n\nWikipedia: List of current Knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Burials\n\nTwo medieval Swedish kings were buried at Riddarholmen Church, as well as the fifteen Swedish monarchs and their spouses from King Gustavus II Adolphus the Great (died 1632) to King Gustaf V (died 1950). The only exception is Queen Christina (reigned 1632 – 1654) who abdicated, then converted to Roman Catholicism and was buried at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Riddarholmen Church also has five non-royal burial chapels, built during the 17th century by various Swedish noble families.\n\nDue to the lack of space, Riddarholmen Church is no longer used as a burial site for the Swedish royal family. The burial place of the Swedish royal family is now the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park in Solna Municipality just north of Stockholm, Sweden, near Haga Palace. In 1922, Margaret of Connaught, Crown Princess of Sweden, first wife of the future King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, was the first person buried in the Royal Cemetery in Haga Park. King Gustaf V (died in 1950) and his wife Queen Victoria (died in 1930) were the last burials at Riddarholmen Church.\n\n1) Tombs of King Magnus III Ladulås and King Karl Knutsson Bonde\n\n2) Gustavian Chapel\n\n3) Karolinska Chapel\n\n4) Bernadotte Chapel\n\n5) Torstensonska Chapel – Built in 1651 for Swedish Field Marshal and military engineer Lennart Torstenson (1603 – 1651)\n\n6) Wachtmeister Chapel – Built in 1654 for Count Hans Wachtmeister of Björkö, Major General and councilor (1609 – 1652).

Before King Gustavus II Adolphus the Great left to fight in the Thirty Years’ War, he designated a burial place for himself in Riddarholmen Church. After he was killed in the Battle of Lützen in 1632, construction began on the tomb, which was completed in 1634. His tomb was made of dark veined Italian marble from Italy and bears the Latin inscription GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS MAGNUS, Gustav Adolf the Great.

In 1718, King Karl XII invaded Norway by laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. He was interred in a black marble sarcophagus topped with a crown, a scepter, and a sword, along with the lion skin and the sword of Hercules, all in gilded brass, as symbols of power and strength.\n\nAlso interred in the Karolinska Chapel in a green coal marble sarcophagus, are King Karl XII’s sister and successor Queen Ulrika Eleonora and her husband King Frederik I.

When Napoleon became Emperor of the French, he created Bernadotte a Marshal of France. In 1810, just as he was about to start a new position as governor of Rome, the Swedish Riksdag elected him heir to the childless King Carl XIII. The Riksdag wanted a soldier to be king because of their worries over Russia. In addition, Bernadotte was popular in Sweden because of his considerate treatment of Swedish prisoners during the recent war with Denmark. Bernadotte became king on February 5, 1818, upon the death of King Carl XIII and reigned as King Carl XIV Johan.\n\nKing Carl XIV Johan is interred in the large sarcophagus in the back of the chapel. The sarcophagus is made out of red Swedish porphyry. It measures 10 feet/3.04 meters × 7.5 feet/2.29 meters × 7.9 feet/2.4 meters and weighs 16 tons.

However, he was also Prince Consort of Sweden from 1718 to 1720 and Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1730 until his death. He was born Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel on April 28, 1676, in Kassel, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, now in the German state of Hesse. Friedrich was the third but the eldest surviving of the twelve sons and the third but the eldest surviving of the seventeen children of Karl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Maria Amalia of Courland. His paternal grandparents were Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg. His maternal grandparents were Jacob, Duke of Courland to Luise Charlotte of Brandenburg. Both his grandmothers were sisters and so his parents were first cousins.\n\nFriedrich had sixteen siblings:\n\nWilhelm of Hesse-Kassel (1674 – 1676), died in early childhood\n\nKarl of Hesse-Kassel (1675 – 1677), died in early childhood\n\nChristian of Hesse-Kassel (born and died 1677), died in infancy\n\nSophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1678 – 1749), married Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, no children\n\nUnnamed son (born and died 1679)\n\nKarl of Hesse-Kassel (1680 – 1702), unmarried, served in the army, died from tetanus\n\nWilhelm VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1682 – 1760), married Dorothea Wilhelmina of Saxe-Zeitz, had three children including Friedrich II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel who married Princess Mary of Great Britain, daughter of King George II of Britain\n\nLeopold of Hesse-Kassel (1684 – 1704), unmarried, died of illness while serving in the army\n\nLudwig of Hesse-Kassel (1686 – 1706), unmarried, killed in battle\n\nMarie Luise of Hesse-Kassel (1688 – 1765), married Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange, had two children including Willem IV, Prince of Orange who married Anne, Princess Royal, daughter of King George II of Great Britain\n\nMaximilian of Hesse-Kassel (1689 – 1753), married Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt, had eight children\n\nUnnamed daughter (born and died 1690)\n\nGeorg Karl of Hesse-Kassel (1691 – 1755), unmarried, served in the Prussian and Swedish armies\n\nEleonore Antoine of Hesse-Kassel (born and died 1694)\n\nWilhelmine Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1695 – 1722), unmarried\n\nUnnamed son (born and died 1696)\n\nAfter completing his education at the University of Utrecht, Friedrich made the Grand Tour, traveling in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, and the German monarchies. He then embarked on a military career, leading the Hessian troops in the War of the Spanish Succession alongside the Dutch and the Holy Roman Empire troops.\n\nOn May 31, 1700, in Berlin, Electorate of Brandenburg, now in the German state of Brandenburg, Friedrich married his first cousin Luise Dorothea of Brandenburg, the only daughter of the future King in Prussia, Friedrich I, and his first wife Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel. Luise Dorothea was sickly and died childless on December 23, 1705, aged 25. After the death of his first wife, Friedrich began to look for a second wife from Europe’s great royal houses. He had bigger ambitions than just being the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He wanted to have influence in a larger monarchy. Friedrich discovered Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden. Her brother Karl XII, King of Sweden was unmarried and Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a possible future heir to the Swedish throne. In 1708, Ulrika Eleonora’s elder sister Hedwig Sophia died from smallpox, leaving her only child eight-year-old Karl Friedrich as a possible heir to the Swedish throne. At the age of two, Karl Friedrich had become Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp upon the death of his father in battle.\n\nAs early as 1710, Hereditary Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel requested Ulrika Eleonora’s hand in marriage but their betrothal was not announced until January 23, 1714. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, who expected Ulrika Eleonora to move with her husband to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, thereby increasing the possibility that the young son of the deceased Hedwig Sophia, Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, would become the heir to the Swedish throne. Ulrika Eleonora and Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel were married on March 24, 1715 in Stockholm, Sweden. Friedrich took the Swedish version of his name, Fredrik, and was granted the title Prince of Sweden and the style of His Royal Highness. Instead of moving to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, the couple remained in Sweden.\n\nIn 1718, Karl XII, King of Sweden invaded Norway by laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl XII was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. Some historians claim Karl XII was assassinated instead of being hit by enemy fire, and that his brother-in-law Fredrik could have hired an assassin to kill Karl XII.\n\nAfter Karl XII’s death, his only surviving sibling Ulrika Eleonora claimed the Swedish throne even though her nephew Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of her brother and was elected Queen of Sweden by the Riksdag, the Swedish legislature. She was crowned at Uppsala Cathedral on March 17, 1719.\n\nUlrika Eleonora wanted to reign jointly with her husband Prince Fredrik as William III and Mary II had done in England but the Swedish nobility rejected the notion. Frederik increased his influence on his wife and in state affairs and then reached out to the most powerful men in Sweden who soon considered a change. Ulrika Eleonora wrote a letter to the Riksdag on February 29, 1720, informing its members of her desire to abdicate in favor of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. The Riksdag confirmed the succession of Ulrika Eleonora’s husband and the condition of her abdication which granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death. On March 24, 1720, Prince Fredrik acceded to the Swedish throne as Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora became Queen Consort. In 1730, Frederik’s father died and he became Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel but immediately appointed his younger brother Wilhelm Regent of Hesse-Kassel. The childless Frederik would be succeeded as Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel by his brother who would reign as Wilhelm VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nAt the beginning of his 31-year-reign, Fredrik was an active monarch. However, after the nobility had regained some power during the wars with Russia, Fredrik was not so much powerless as uninterested in the affairs of state. The battle losses in the Great Northern War suffered by Frederik’s brother-in-law Karl XII, King of Sweden ended Sweden’s position as a major European power. Under Frederik’s reign, this had to be accepted. Sweden also had to cede land to Russia in the 1721 Treaty of Nystad. In 1723, Fredrik tried unsuccessfully to strengthen his royal authority but failed and thereafter, he never had much to do with politics. Fredrik did not even sign official documents, instead, a stamp of his signature was used. He devoted most of his time to hunting and his affairs. One lasting accomplishment was the institution of the three principal Swedish orders of chivalry: the Royal Order of the Seraphim, the Royal Order of the Sword, and the Royal Order of the Polar Star.\n\nIn 1734, Swedish noblewoman Hedwig Taube (1714 – 1744) became Fredrik’s official mistress. She was given the title Countess of Hessenstein and bore Fredrik four children. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von Düben who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair because it would be beneath the queen’s dignity. Hedwig Taube died a week after the birth of her daughter Hedwig Amalia. She was originally buried at Vadsbro Church. At a later date, her son Karl Edvard had his mother’s remains transferred to Strängnäs Cathedral where she was interred next to her daughter Hedwig Amalia. After Hedwig Taube’s death, Fredrik took another official mistress, Swedish noblewoman Catharina Ebba Horn, who was given gave the title Countess. Catharina was Fredrik’s mistress for only three years, agreeing to leave her position after having received a great fortune and three estates.\n\nWhile both of his marriages were childless, Fredrik had four children with Hedwig Taube:\n\nFredrika Vilhelmina von Hessenstein (1732 – 1734), died in early childhood\n\nFredrik Vilhelm von Hessenstein (1735 – 1808), unmarried, had a career in the Swedish army\n\nKarl Edvard von Hessenstein (1737 – 1769), unmarried, had a career in the Swedish army\n\nHedwig Amalia von Hessenstein (1744 – 1752), died in childhood\n\nOn November 24, 1741, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora died from smallpox at the age of 53. She was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Because Fredrik and Ulrika Eleonora had no children, Fredrik had no heir. This situation was eventually solved by Elizabeth, Empress of All Russia.\n\nAfter the death of his first cousin Karl Friedrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp in 1739, Prince Adolf Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp became the administrator of the duchy for his cousin’s 11-year-old son Karl Peter Ulrich. Karl Peter Ulrich’s mother was the deceased Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, the elder surviving daughter of Peter I (the Great), Emperor of All Russia. When his mother’s sister Elizabeth succeeded as Empress of Russia, she named her nephew Karl Peter Ulrich as her successor. Now called Peter, he married Adolf Friedrich’s niece Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst. Later, he reigned briefly as Peter III, Emperor of All Russia until he was deposed by his wife who reigned as Catherine II (the Great), Empress of All Russia.\n\nIn 1743, after the Russo-Swedish War (1741-1743) which ended in Sweden’s defeat, negotiations were held with Elizabeth, Empress of All Russia. She agreed to restore part of Finland to Sweden if her heir’s uncle, Adolf Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp, was made heir to the childless King Fredrik I of Sweden. Thereafter, Adolf Friedrich was known by the Swedish version of his name, Adolf Fredrik.\n\nFredrik I, King of Sweden survived his wife by ten years. After suffering several strokes, he died on March 25, 1751, aged 74, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, and Adolf Frederik of Holstein-Gottorp succeeded to the Swedish throne. Fredrik was buried with his wife at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born on January 23, 1688, at Tre Kronor Castle, on the site of the current Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden, she was the youngest of the seven children and the youngest of the two daughters of Karl XI, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. Her paternal grandparents were Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg were her maternal grandparents.\n\nUlrika Eleonora had six siblings but only her eldest brother and her only sister survived childhood:\n\nHedwig Sophia of Sweden (1681 – 1708), married her first cousin Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and had one son, Hedwig Sophia and her husband were the paternal grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia\n\nKarl XII, King of Sweden (1682 – 1718), unmarried\n\nGustav of Sweden (1683 – 1685), died in early childhood\n\nUlric of Sweden (1684 – 1685), died in infancy\n\nFredrik of Sweden (born and died 1685), died in infancy\n\nKarl Gustav of Sweden (1686 – 1687)\n\nWhen Ulrika Eleonora was five years old, her mother died. Four years later, her father died and her fifteen-year-old brother succeeded to the throne as Karl XII, King of Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora and her two surviving siblings Hedwig Sophia and Karl were placed in the care of their paternal grandmother Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. She was quite formidable, was the Dowager Queen of Sweden for 55 years, and would remain visible in Swedish politics and society until she died in 1715.\n\nBeing seven years younger than her sister and six years younger than her brother, Ulrika Eleonora was overshadowed by her elder siblings. As the years went by and her brother Karl XII remained unmarried, Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a possible future heir to the Swedish throne, and her value in the royal marriage market increased. Suitors for her hand in marriage included Prince Carl of Denmark, son of King Christian V of Denmark, the future King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, and the future King George II of Great Britain but no marriage materialized.\n\nIn 1708, Ulrika Eleonora’s sister Hedwig Sophia died from smallpox, leaving her only child eight-year-old Karl Friedrich as a possible heir to the Swedish throne. At the age of two, Karl Friedrich had become Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp upon the death of his father in battle. Ulrika Eleonora’s brother Karl II, King of Sweden suffered a horrendous defeat in 1709 at the Battle of Poltava during the Great Northern War. The Swedish defeat at the Battle of Poltava marked the downfall of the Swedish Empire and the rise of the Russian Empire. After losing the battle, Karl XII fled south to the Ottoman Empire where he remained for five years.\n\nAs early as 1710, Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, the eldest surviving son and heir of Karl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, requested Ulrika Eleonora’s hand in marriage but their betrothal was not announced until January 23, 1714. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, who expected Ulrika Eleonora to move with her husband to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, thereby increasing the possibility that the young son of the deceased Hedwig Sophia, Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, would become the heir to the Swedish throne. Ulrika Eleonora and Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel were married on March 24, 1715. Friedrich took the Swedish version of his name, Fredrik, and was granted the title Prince of Sweden and the style of His Royal Highness. Instead of moving to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, the couple remained in Sweden, Their marriage was childless.\n\nIn 1718, Karl XII, King of Sweden once again invaded Norway by laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. The invasion was abandoned and Karl’s body was returned to Sweden where he was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm.\n\nAfter Karl XII’s death, his only surviving sibling Ulrika Eleonora claimed the Swedish throne even though her nephew Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of her brother and was elected Queen of Sweden by the Riksdag, the Swedish legislature. She was crowned at Uppsala Cathedral on March 17, 1719, and made her formal entrance into Stockholm on April 11, 1719.\n\nUlrika Eleonora wanted to reign jointly with her husband Prince Fredrik as William III and Mary II had done in England but the Swedish nobility rejected the notion. Frederik increased his influence on his wife and in state affairs and then reached out to the most powerful men in Sweden who soon considered a change. Ulrika Eleonora wrote a letter to the Riksdag on February 29, 1720, informing its members of her desire to abdicate in favor of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. The Riksdag confirmed the succession of Ulrika Eleonora’s husband and the condition of her abdication which granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death. On March 24, 1720, Prince Fredrik acceded to the Swedish throne as Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora became Queen Consort.\n\nAlthough Ulrika Eleonora had an interest in affairs of state, she withdrew from all visible participation in them, occupying herself with reading, charity, and her many friends. In 1730, Frederik’s father died and he became Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel but immediately appointed his younger brother Wilhelm Regent of Hesse-Kassel. Ulrika Eleonora acted as Regent of Sweden on two occasions: during Fredrik’s trip to Hesse-Kassel from July – November 1731 and during his illness from July – September 1738. In 1734, Swedish noblewoman Hedwig Taube became Fredrik’s official mistress. She was given the title Countess of Hessenstein and bore Fredrik four children. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von Düben who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair because it would be beneath the queen’s dignity.\n\nOn November 24, 1741, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora died from smallpox at the age of 53.

After losing a decisive battle during the Great Nothern War in which he was wounded and lost one-third of his forces, Karl fled to the Ottoman Empire and remained there for five years. Upon his return to Sweden, he started an offensive military campaign and ultimately lost his life in battle. Karl XII, King of Sweden was the second of the seven children and the eldest and the only surviving son of the five sons of Karl XI, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. He was born on June 17, 1682, at Tre Kronor Castle which was on the site of the current Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. His paternal grandparents were Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg were his maternal grandparents.\n\nKarl had six siblings but only his two sisters survived childhood:\n\nHedwig Sophia of Sweden (1681 – 1708), married her first cousin Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and had one son, Hedwig Sophia and her husband were the paternal grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia\n\nGustav of Sweden (1683 – 1685), died in early childhood\n\nUlric of Sweden (1684 – 1685), died in infancy\n\nFredrik of Sweden (born and died 1685), died in infancy\n\nKarl Gustav of Sweden (1686 – 1687), died in infancy\n\nUlrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden (1688 – 1741), married Friedrich V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and had no children, she succeeded her childless brother and two years later abdicated the Swedish throne in favor of her husband who reigned as Fredrik I, King of Sweden\n\nKarl’s mother Ulrika Eleonora was a very visible parent and active in raising her children. His father Karl XI gave orders that Karl was to receive a comprehensive education that would prepare him to be King of Sweden. Karl received instruction in riding, hunting, and fencing from his father. At the age of four, Karl’s mother began his academic instruction. He later received lessons in military science, foreign languages, math, geography, history, literature, and legal matters from specially selected tutors.\n\nWhen Karl was only eleven years old his mother Ulrika Eleonora died. Four years later, on April 6, 1697, his father died and the fifteen-year-old succeeded to the throne as Karl XII, King of Sweden. His paternal grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, who had been the Regent of Sweden for her son Karl XI, who became King of Sweden at the age of four, was also the Regent of Sweden for her grandson Karl XII. However, seven months later, on December 14, 1697, Karl XII proclaimed himself king and refused to continue with a regency. The Swedish Riksdag declared him to be of legal age. Karl XII’s grandmother Hedwig Eleonora was quite formidable and was the Dowager Queen of Sweden for 55 years. She remained visible in Swedish politics and society until her death and her grandson Karl XII had great respect for her. After the regency, Hedwig Eleonora continued with the upbringing of her three surviving grandchildren. Because of this Karl had strong ties to his grandmother and his two sisters.\n\nFor almost all of his reign, Karl XII led Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700 – 1721). He acted as the general of the army and achieved significant success for several years. However, a failed campaign in Russia in 1708 – 1709, drastically changed the situation. At the Battle of Poltava in July 1709, Karl XII was wounded and unable to lead the Swedish forces. One-third of the Swedish army was killed and the Swedish supply train was destroyed. The Swedish army was inferior to the larger and more modern army of Peter I (the Great) of Russia. After losing the battle, Karl XII fled south to the Ottoman Empire with a force of 1,000. The remainder of the Swedish army surrendered and most of them spent the rest of their lives in Russian captivity. The Swedish defeat at the Battle of Poltava marked the downfall of the Swedish Empire and the rise of the Russian Empire.\n\nKarl XII remained in the Ottoman Empire for five years. The main reason for his long stay in the Ottoman Empire was that Karl hoped to persuade the Turks to open a second front against Russia in southern Europe, easing the military pressure on Sweden. The Turks initially welcomed Karl’s presence but after five years, they wanted him gone. During his five-year stay in the Ottoman Empire, Karl corresponded with his sister Ulrika Eleonora who was now his heir as his elder sister Hedwig Sophia died from smallpox in 1708. Over the years, Karl ruled his kingdom from the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the Swedish Council of State and Riksdag tried to keep Sweden organized and independent. However, in the autumn of 1714, Karl received a letter warning him that unless he returned to Sweden, the Council of State and the Riksdag would independently conclude a peace treaty with Russia, Poland, and Denmark. Karl rushed back to Sweden on horseback making the journey in fifteen days.\n\nWhen Karl returned home, he found Sweden at war with Russia, Saxony, Hanover, Great Britain, and Denmark. Karl planned to attack Norway which was ruled jointly with Denmark. He hoped that if he cut Denmark’s Norwegian supply lines the Danish forces would be withdrawn from Swedish territory. Karl invaded Norway in 1716, occupied the capital of Christiania (today’s Oslo), and laid siege to the Akershus Fortress but he was unsuccessful and was forced to withdraw.\n\nIn 1718, Karl once again invaded Norway, laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. The invasion was abandoned and Karl’s body was returned to Sweden where he was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm.\n\nThe exact circumstances of Karl’s death remain unclear. His body has been exhumed three times, in 1746, 1859, and 1917, in attempts to determine the exact cause of death. Despite multiple investigations of the battlefield, Karl’s skull, and his clothes, it is still uncertain how he was hit or whether the shot came from the enemy or his own forces.\n\nKarl XII never married. He had been encouraged to find a suitable wife to secure the succession but he avoided the subject of sex and marriage. After his death, his only surviving sibling Ulrika Eleonora claimed the throne. Her deceased older sister Hedwig Sophia had a son Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, who had the better claim by primogeniture. However, Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of her brother and was recognized as his successor by the Riksdag. After a reign of two years, she abdicated in 1720 in favor of her husband Friedrich V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel who reigned as Fredrik I, King of Sweden.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born in Copenhagen, Denmark on September 11, 1656, she was the sixth of the eight children and fourth of the five daughters of Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her paternal grandparents were Christian IV, King of Denmark and Norway and Anna Katharina of Brandenburg. Her maternal grandparents were Georg, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Anna Eleonora of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ulrika Eleonora was the sister of Christian V, King of Denmark and Prince Jørgen of Denmark, better known as Prince George, Duke of Cumberland, the husband of Queen Anne of Great Britain.\n\nUlrika Eleonora had seven siblings:\n\nChristian V, King of Denmark (1646 – 1699), married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, had eight children\n\nAnna Sophie of Denmark (1647 – 1717), married Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony, had two children\n\nFrederica Amalia of Denmark (1649 – 1704), married Christian Albrecht, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, had three children\n\nWilhelmina Ernestina of Denmark (1650 – 1706), married Karl II, Elector Palatine, no children\n\nFrederik of Denmark (1651 – 1652), died in infancy\n\nJørgen of Denmark (1653 – 1708), married Anne, Queen of Great Britain, Anne had 17 pregnancies with only five children being born alive. Two died on the day of their birth, two died at less than two years old within six days of each from smallpox, and one died at age 11.\n\nDorothea of Denmark (1657 – 1658), died in infancy\n\nIn 1675, Ulrika Eleonora became betrothed to Karl XI, King of Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora’s brother King Christian V was not in favor of the match but he left the final decision up to his mother who favored the match because her daughter would be a queen. However, the Scanian War between Denmark and Sweden from 1675 – 1679 postponed the wedding. King Christian V broke off the engagement but his sister still considered herself betrothed to Karl XI. In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, a marriage between Ulrika Eleonora and Karl XI, King of Sweden was on the agenda, and a marriage was agreed upon. Ulrika Eleonora and Karl XI were married on May 6, 1680, in Skottorp Castle in Skummeslöv, Halland, Sweden. The new Queen of Sweden was crowned on November 25, 1680, at Storkyrkan (Great Church) in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nUlrika Eleonora and Karl XI had seven children but only three survived childhood:\n\nHedwig Sophia of Sweden (1681 – 1708), married her first cousin Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, had one son, paternal grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia\n\nKarl XII, King of Sweden (1682 – 1718), unmarried\n\nGustav of Sweden (1683 – 1685), died in early childhood\n\nUlric of Sweden (1684 – 1685), died in infancy\n\nFredrik of Sweden (born and died 1685), died in infancy\n\nKarl Gustav of Sweden (1686 – 1687), died in infancy\n\nUlrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden (1688 – 1741), married Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, later Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Friedrich V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, no children Ulrika Eleonora succeeded her childless brother and two years later abdicated the Swedish throne in favor of her husband\n\nUlrika Eleonora’s husband had become King of Sweden when he was only four years old. His mother Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, who was Dowager Queen for 55 years and would survive both her son and her daughter-in-law, was the Regent of Sweden until Karl XI reached his majority. Ulrika Eleonora had no political influence as her husband preferred to discuss politics with his mother. Hedwig Eleonora remained the first lady of the court. Karl XI always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as “My Wife” and his mother as “The Queen”. Foreign ambassadors always paid their respects to Hedwig Eleonora first, and then to Ulrika Eleonora. The hostility between Hedwig Eleonora’s homeland Holstein-Gottorp and Ulrika Eleonora’s homeland Denmark made the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law even more tense.\n\nUlrika Eleonora was very active in charity. She founded a large number of charitable institutions that were administered by her chamberlain Sophia Amalia Marschalk and her principal lady-in-waiting and mistress of the robes Maria Elisabeth Stenbock. It is estimated that 7/8 of Ulrika Eleonora’s income went to her charities and she even sold her possessions to finance her charitable projects. Her best-known projects were a tapestry school at Karlberg Palace where orphan girls were educated in tapestry manufacturing, the Queen’s House, a home for poor widows in Stockholm, and a poor house at Kungsholmen. Ulrika Eleonora arranged for food to be distributed to areas suffering from failed crops and starvation and paid the medical bills for a large number of people in Stockholm. She commissioned doctors and midwives to develop scientific-based obstetrics and an orderly birth system in Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora supported a large number of needy people with regular allowances from her income. In 1693, the year of her death, 17,000 people were supported by her.\n\nAfter the birth of her seventh and last child in 1688, Ulrika Eleonora’s health continually weakened, so much so that she seldom participated in court events. A trip to see her family in Denmark in 1688 had to be canceled. In 1690, Ulrika Eleonora developed a fatal non-diagnosed illness. Her doctors recommended a trip to the hot springs and funds were set aside for the trip but Ulrika Eleonora refused to go and instead used the funds for charity.\n\nUlrika Eleonora died at Karlberg Palace in Solna Municipality, Sweden, outside Stockholm, on July 26, 1693, aged 36, after having spent 1692 -1693 in bed. Her husband Karl XI mourned her greatly and remarked upon her death, “Here I leave half of my heart.” She had requested a simple funeral and that her husband give most of the funds set aside for her funeral to charity. Karl XI did not respect her wish for a simple funeral but he did contribute the cost of her funeral to the poor. Ulrika Eleonora was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Karl XI survived his wife by less than four years, dying on April 5, 1697, at Tre Kronor Castle in Stockholm, Sweden, aged 41. He had suffered from abdominal pains for three years. An autopsy revealed that he had developed cancer that had spread throughout the abdominal cavity. Karl was buried with his wife at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThere is an eerie legend associated with the death of Ulrika Eleonora. After the death of Ulrika Eleonora, she was laid out at Karlberg Palace before her funeral. One night, a carriage arrived from Stockholm carrying Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, Ulrika Eleonora’s principal lady-in-waiting and mistress of the robes. Maria Elisabeth, who was carrying her little dog Camillo, was escorted to Ulrika Eleonora’s room by the officer in charge Captain Stormcrantz. When he thought she was taking too long, he looked through the keyhole and saw Maria Elisabeth and Ulrika Eleonora standing by the window talking to each other. Captain Stormcrantz was so shocked by the sight that he started coughing up blood. Maria Elisabeth, as well as her carriage, were gone the next moment. When the matter was investigated, it was discovered that Maria Elisabeth had been in bed, gravely ill, and had not left her home. King Karl XI gave orders that the incident was not to be mentioned again. Whatever the explanation, Captain Stormcrantz died soon after, reportedly from shock after what he thought he had witnessed, and Maria Elisabeth Stenbock died of her illness on October 9, 1693.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
