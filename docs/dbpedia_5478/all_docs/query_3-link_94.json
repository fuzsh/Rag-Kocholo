        "text": "Hey, does anyone remember that bright young Bonaparte kid? Showed up out of nowhere, shot across Europe like a shooting star, had a great career ahead of him, and then BAM! Vanished. Anybody know what he’s up to these days?\n\nWell, he died of stomach cancer on a small South Atlantic island in 1821, and good riddance too, but his family is still around. Honestly, it’s pretty amazing. Napoleon was a dominant presence in European politics for less than two decades, and during that time virtually every member of his family managed to marry someone important. And while the family lost it’s political importance after 1871, its members remain embedded throughout the world. They’re like kudzu. Turn over any leaf or rock in the world and you’re likely to find a member of the House of Bonaparte or one of it’s associated families. There have been Bonaparte politicians and generals and Kings and scientists and artists and revolutionaries, in virtually every country in Europe and quite a few beyond. In this article, I’d like to continue the truly mammoth task of tracing these lines. Going through Napoleon himself and each of his siblings and children, I’ll trace the lines of descent to the present day (to the best of my ability) and note people of interest. Please note this is a non-exhaustive list, as many people are not important enough for any information to be available about them. So think of this as a highlights tour.\n\nLet’s continue.\n\nPrevious Installments: Part One\n\nEugène de Beauharnais (1781-1824)\n\nEugène was Napoleon’s stepson, the son of his first wife Josephine’s first marriage. Bonaparte, to his credit, showered his adoptive relatives with the same sort of nepotistic largess he showered upon his siblings, and Eugène (to his credit) was competent enough to live up to his responsibilities. He served as his stepfather’s aide-de-camp in Egypt and Italy, and showed remarkable valor at the Battle of Marengo. In 1805 he was named Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy and commander of the Army of Italy, which he led with distinction through the War of the Fifth Coalition, the Russian Invasion of 1812, and the War of the Sixth Coalition. As he had married the Bavarian princess Augusta in 1806, he was able to seek refugee in Munich after Napoleon’s first abdication. He remained there until his death in 1824 as a Bavarian nobleman, never again showing any interest in French politics.\n\nSo, de Beauharnais’s family tree is truly massive, and manages to twist it’s way into virtually every royal house in Europe. So I’ll do my best to keep this straight, but it may get confusing. Eugène had seven children. Princess Eugénie (1808-1847) and Princess Carolina (?-?) did nothing of any interest that I can find so we’ll ignore them. His oldest child, Joséphine (1807-1876), is another matter entirely. In 1822, she was chosen by Jean Bernadotte, formerly one of Emperor Napoleon I’s Marshals and now King of Sweden under the name Charles XIV John (Don’t ask, it’s a long story) as a potential wife for his son Oscar. Reportedly, her connections both to the Bonaparte dynasty and to the ancient House of Leuchtenberg were what drew the king’s attention. As Queen, Josephine distinguished herself as an important liberal advisor, supporting legislation in 1845-1846 that abolished guilds, reformed the prisons, and mandated equal inheritance for men and women. She was also a strong supporter of the 1858 legalization of Catholicism. She died in 1876, outliving her husband by seventeen years.\n\nJosephine had five children. Her youngest child was Prince August (1831-1871). All I know about him is that he loved trains, they named a locomotive after him, and because he was commonly believed to be an idiot, the expression “dummare än tåget” (“more stupid than the train”) entered the Swedish language. This is amazing. Princess Eugénie (1830-1889) was the next-youngest, and is remembered mostly for being an amateur scultpor and painter, as well as a philantrophist. Of interest perhaps is her refusal to every marry, her claims that as a child she’d wished she’d be born a boy, and the fact that she was the first unmarried woman in Sweden to petition for legal majority in 1858 when this was legalized. She was very close to her brother Prince Gustaf, who was an accomplished musician. He’s remembered for the Studentsången, traditionally sung at high school graduations in Sweden, and the Spring Song, sung by male choruses on Walpurgisnacht . None bore issue.\n\nHer oldest son was King Charles XV (1826-1872), a popular king and far-ranging reformer. He became king in 1860, overhauled Sweden’s municipal laws in 1862, it’s ecclesiastic law in 1863, and it’s criminal law in 1864. He was a strong supporter of Pan-Scandinavianism, and wished to aid Denmark against Prussia and Austria in the 1864 Second Schleswig War but was forced to declare neutrality by his government. His only legitimate child to survive into adulthood was Louise of Sweden (1851-1926), who married King Frederick VIII of Denmark. She had a difficult time in Denmarck—she and her mother-in-law cordially loathed each other, and she did not get along with the Danish court. She is mostly remembered his popularizing swimming and for her charitable work. Her children were more interesting. Well, some of them at least.\n\nHer oldest son was King Christian X of Denmark (1870-1947). In 1920, Christian sparked the Easter Crisis when he dismissed a democratically-elected cabinet and almost caused a revolution. This made him less than popular but his reputation recovered due to his actions during WWII, when he became a symbol of national unity. Though the story that he wore a Yellow Star in solidarity with Danish Jews is false (Danish Jews were never forced to wear the star), it is based on an excerpt from his diary where he says “I stated that I could not meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we would best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.” He also supported and financed the evacuation of Danish Jews to Sweden. He was followed as king by his son Frederick IX (1899-1972), who in turn was followed by his daughter Queen Margarethe II (1972-present). She is the first woman to rule Denmark since Queen Margarethe I, who reigned over a unified Scandinavia during the 1375–1412 Kalmar Union. As of today, Margarethe II has not conquered Sweden or Norway. Her oldest son is Crown Prince Frederik (1968-present), an avid supporter of climate science who has authored several papers on it and supports a number of scientific organizations.\n\nFredrick IX also had a daughter, Anne-Marie (1946-present), who was Queen of Greece from 1964 to 1973. However, both herself and her husband King Constantine II had been in exile in Italy since 1967 when he had attempted to stage a counter-coup against the Military Junta which had seized power. Anne-Maria mostly seems to be known today for an incident in 2004 at the Palace of Zarzuela in Madrid, when Vittorio Emanuele, last Crown Prince of Italy (and generally sketchy dude, though he’s been acquitted of all charges thus far) approached his rival claimant for the headship of the House of Savoy, Prince Amedo of Aosta, and punched him in the face. The Prince almost fell down a flight of stairs, but Anne-Marie caught him and provided first aid. Good for her!\n\nQueen Louise’s other interesting child was King Haakon VII of Norway (1872-1957). Norway had been in a personal union with Sweden until 1905, and Haakon was the new Kingdom’s first monarch. In 1927, when the Labor Party won a parliamentary majority he was advised to block them from forming a government. He famously said “I am also the King of the Communists” and invited their leader to become Prime Minister. He is, however, most famous for his actions in 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded Norway. With German forces landing across the country, the German ambassador ordered the Norwegian government to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Prime Minister and surrender as Denmark had. Haakon told his cabinet that they could do whatever they wanted but if they chose surrender he would abdicate. They chose resistance. King Haakon and his cabinet were able to escape to Britain, where he spent the rest of the war recording propaganda broadcasts and supporting the Norwegian resistance. Today, he is remembered as one of the greatest Norwegians of the 20th century.\n\nHe was followed as king by his only son Olav V (1903-1991), known as the Folkekongen (the people’s king). He is mostly famous because during the 1973 energy crisis driving was banned on certain weekends so he took the train by himself to go skiing. When asked why he didn’t take any bodyguards, he replied “I have four million bodyguards”, i.e, the entire population of Norway. Cool dude. He was followed as king by his son Harald V (1937-present).\n\nNow! Returning back to Queen Josephine of Sweden, we go to King Charles XV’s younger brother and successor, King Oscar II (1829-1907. He did very little of interest domestically, but was an important figure in foreign affairs. He mediated imperial disputes over Samoa in 1889 and 1899, and helped negotiate an end to the Venezuela Crisis in 1897. He was also basically the only European head of state to support Great Britain in the Second Boer War. His picture and name are used to this day by King Oscar Sardines and Göteborgs Kex AB gingerbread cookies. Oscar several children, most of whom were quite tedious. His son Prince Eugen, the Duke of Närke (1865-1947), however, apparently became one the era’s most prominent landscape painters. Also he was gay. His son Gustaf V (1858-1950) followed him as king, and was the last Swedish king to exercise royal prerogatives. In 1919, a government of Liberals and Social Democrats effectively turned Sweden into a parliamentary democracy with universal suffrage. Gustaf is till controversial for his alleged support for collaboration with the Nazis during WWII, and for his involvement in the Haijby Affair, in which he was accused of paying four million kronor to a man named Kurt Haijby, who claimed to have been the king’s lover. Also, he represented Sweden in competitive tennis tournaments into his 80s.\n\nGustav V had three sons but the only one I care about is King Gustav VI Adolf (1882-1973). He was an amateur archeologist with a lifelong fascination with Ancient Italian cultures. His reign as mainly remembered as the one during which a new Swedish constitution was promulgated stripping the monarchy of all but ceremonial powers. His eldest son was Prince Gustav Adolf (1906-1947). He represented Sweden in show jumping at the 1936 Olympics and he may have been sympathetic to the Nazis, though this is still debated. He died in an airplane crash in 1947. His son Carl XVI Gustav (1946-present) followed his grandfather onto the throne, and remains king to this day. He has done nothing of any interest. His next oldest son was Sigvard Bernadotte (1907-2002), born Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland, but stripped of his royal titles in 1934 when he married a commoner. This understandably annoyed Mr. Bernadotte and he spent much of the rest of his life involved in various legal battles to try and get his titles recognized, culminating in his attempt to get the European Court of Human Rights to force Sweden to acknowledge his royal status. The ECHR did not oblige. Bernadotte made his living as a very successful industrial designer, and is most famous for the Red Clara opener, EKA Swede 38 folding knife, the Margrethe bowl, the Bernadotte jug, and the Facit Private typewriter.\n\nGustav VI Adolf had several sons who I don’t care about, but I think it’s worthwhile mentioning his daughter Queen Ingrid (1910-2000), who married the aforementioned King Fredrick IX of Denmark, and is the mother of the current Danish queen Margrethe II. She is mostly remembered for modernizing the customs of the Danish court.\n\nWell, the GOOD news is that we’re now DONE with the Swedish/Danish/Royal families. Hooray! Are we done with the de Beauharnais family? HA HA HA, no, I wish. Eugène had a lot of children. His oldest son was Prince Consort Auguste of Portugal (1810-1835). He was put forward as a candidate for the newly created throne of Belgium in 1831, but came in second place in the election by the Belgian National Congress. In 1834 he was selected as husband by Queen Maria II of Portugal, who wanted a consort with no actual power-base or dynastic connections of his own. (Portugal had been having some minor dynastic civil wars at the time). Sadly, he died two months after the wedding. The de Beauharnaises had another Portuguese connection, however. In 1830, Eugène’s daughter Amélie (1812-1873) became Empress of Brazil, marrying Emperor Pedro I. Though it was apparently a very happy marriage, the Brazilian Empire was a highly unstable state, and her time in the country was marked by political turmoil and economic crisis. Don Pedro abdicated in 1831, and the couple returned to Europe, where Don Pedro got involved in a Portuguese civil war to put his daughter Maria on the throne. Yes, the Maria mentioned earlier.\n\nI’d also like to mention Théodolinde de Beauharnais (1814-1857). She did absolutely nothing of interest, but one of her descendants is “Danielle, Freiin von und zu Bodman, wife of prince Inigo von Urach, current pretender of Lithuanian throne”. God the Bonapartes are a weird family.\n\nNow, at long last, we come to last son of Eugène, Maximilian de Beauharnais (1817-1952), who entered the Russian imperial family with his marriage to Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, the daughter of Czar Nicholas I. He had a number of children. Prince Sergei Maximilianovich (1849–1877) was killed in the Russo-Turkish War. His daughter, Princess Eugenia Maximilianovna (1845-1925), married Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenberg, a Russo-German duke. Alexander served as Commander of the Imperial Guard, and was named chief of military medical services during WWI. At one point he was the Russian candidate for the throne of Bulgaria but he did not get the job. Both members of the couple survived the Russian Revolution. Their only son was Duke Peter Alexandrovich (1864-1924), mainly known for marrying Czar Nicholas II’s youngest sister the Grand Duchess Olga. It was a deeply unhappy marriage, as Peter Alexandrovich was widely believed to be gay. Olga openly took a lover in 1903, and the couple were divorced in 1916. Both survived the Revolution.\n\nMaximilian de Beauharnais’s youngest son was Prince George Maximilianovich (1852-1912). He’s not a very interesting person. In 1900, when married the Princess Anastasia of Montenegro he was considered a possible successor to the childless King Alexander I of Sweden but then Alex got overthrown and murdered in a military coup. So that didn’t happen. He also witnessed the Potemkin Revolt in 1905 when staying at a resort on the Black Sea. That’s pretty cool! He had some boring children, and also a son named Alexander Georgievich (1881-1941). In 1909, Alexander was widely rumored to be secretly engaged to Marjorie Gould, granddaughter of the railway tycoon Jay Gould. However, the two put out a statement saying they were just good friends. In 1917-1918, Georgievich was involved in discussions with the British and German governments to rescue the Czar and his family from the Bolsheviks, but these plans came to naught. He was arrested by Bolshevik authorities in 1917 but seems to have either been released or escaped. In 1919, a Bolshevik wireless message was sent to the Washington Post (?!) asserting that a convention of Monarchists in Siberia had named Georgievich Czar but there is no evidence of this.\n\nFinally, we have George Maximilianovich’s sister Princess Maria Maximilianovna (1841-1914). She married Prince William of Baden in 1863, after which they received a telegram of congratulations from Abraham Lincoln. That’s cool I guess. After her husband’s death in 1897 she founded the German Anti-Immorality Association, dedicated to suppressing vice among the upper classes. It sounds unimaginably tedious to me. Her only son was Prince Maximilian of Baden (1867-1929), a truly fascinating figure. Prince Max, as he’s often know, was a fairly marginal figure in Imperial German politics, known mainly for his eccentrically liberal politics. He came to prominence in October 1918 when he was appointed Chancellor of the German Empire and charged with carrying out a political reform and negotiating an armistice with the Allies, both of which he thought were impossible tasks. Unlike Kaiser Wilhelm II and the German High Command, Prince Max soon realized that the war was utterly lost and that the German State itself might soon collapse. In early November, elements of the German Navy mutinied and raised the Red Flag. As Berlin collapsed in chaos, Prince Max told the Kaiser he must abdicate. Wilhelm refused, and so Maximilian forced his hand by unilaterally announcing his abdication anyways and unconstitutionally appointing Fredrick Ebert, the head of the German Social Democratic Party, as Chancellor. Ebert would go on to be first President of the Weimar Republic. It is not an exaggeration to say that Prince Max was one of the pivotal figure in Germany’s transition to democracy.\n\nPrince Max had two children. Princess Marie Alexandra (1902-1944) died in a bombing raid on Frankfurt in 1944. His son Margrave Berthold of Baden (1906-1963) lived a long, boring life, notable only for his marriage to Princess Theodora, Prince Philip the Duke of Edinbourough’s older sister. This means that his son Margrave Maximilian of Baden (1933-present), who remains the head of the House of Zähringen to this day, is somewhere on the list of possible claiments to the throne the United Kingdom.\n\nJust to conclude this exhaustingly long tromp through European geneologies, here is a list of Royal and Imperial Families the de Beauharnais ended up part of:\n\nSweden\n\nDenmark\n\nNorway\n\nPortugal\n\nBrazil\n\nRussia\n\nGreece\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nMontenegro\n\nLithuania (?)\n\nJoin us next time for part three of this exciting series, when we dive into the history of Lucien Bonaparte, last of the Jacobins!"
