        "text": "Solna is very well placed between central Stockholm area and the international Stockholm Arlanda airport. Although Solna is an integral part of central Stockholm, it works as an independent municipality. Solna has an extensive – and growing – network of sustainable public transport and is easily reachable from other parts of the region.\n\nSolna is one of Sweden’s fastest-growing municipalities with six new city districts being currently built. Today’s 85,000 inhabitants are estimated to grow up to 100,000 by 2030. The city of Solna is also a popular destination for businesses, partly due to its location and partly due to the business-friendly climate and inclusiveness and diversity in the area that is a highlight of Solna.\n\nA third of Solna is green open spaces. A third of the Royal National City Park is part of Solna. The uniqueness and cultural beauty of the park is that it includes some of the beautiful neo classical Royal Palaces, which makes it one of the most-visited recreation areas in the city..\n\nNestled in nature, Solna boasts three nature reserves, several bays and lakes, known both for their biodiversity and recreation.\n\nSolna is very well connected to most of the city and Arlanda airport. Distance to Stockholm city center Drive to city – 11 min adjust 7 kms.\n\nSolna Centrum is a hub to connect to every part of the city with ease.\n\nSolna is on the blue line on the Stockholm metro. One can go straight to Kungstragården which is the city center directly. The nearest commuter train station is Sundbyberg.\n\nSolna is also well connected by the city bus services to get around to all the neighboring areas including the airport."
