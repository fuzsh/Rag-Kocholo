On his death in 1973, King Gustaf VI Adolf bequeathed Sofiero to the city of Helsingborg to ensure everyone now can enjoy the charming castle and its interesting history.\n\nIn the garden you will find Sofiero Slottsrestaurang, which is ranked as one of Swedenâs best restaurants, as well as the palace shop and Sofieroâs nursery where you can buy souvenirs, chocolates and flowers. Children have a lot of uproarious fun at âSofiero for Childrenâ, where they can run around on the large green lawns, play at the playground and hide in the labyrinth â just like princesses and princes used to do.\n\n2.
