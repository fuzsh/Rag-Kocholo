Throne Room, Royal Palace, Stockholm, 21st June 1905.\n\nFrom the book Oscar II En Lefvandsteckning by Andreas Hasselgren, Fröleen, Stockholm, 1908.\n\n​Source: Wikipedia/Unknown photographer (scanned by Ristesson Ent.)\n\n​​Having looked at the present Swedish Royal Family and their Ducal Titles, we turn now to the history of previous holders and their spouses.\n\nWe will just be looking at the House of Bernadotte, which was founded in 1818. The first date, however, is 1810 for Prince Oscar who became HM King Oscar I in 1844. He was created Duke in anticipation of his Father, Jean Bernadotte, ascending the Throne and succeeding the heirless King Carl XIII.\n\n​We will also be looking at the remaining Provinces not covered in Part One.\n\nAs was pointed out in the previous Blog on the subject, ducal titles were only extended to princesses after the change in the Act of Succession which came into force on 1st January 1980 and made Victoria Crown Princess. Also, as mentioned in the previous Blog, the placement of the Quarter representing the appropriate Dukedom/Province's Coat of Arms has settled down to a version which is more pleasing to the eye. The previous arrangements became awkward because of giving equal balance to Sweden and Norway due to the personal union of the separate kingdoms under a common monarch which lasted from 1814 until its amicable and peaceful dissolution in 1905.\n\nEqually, there were no Norwegian Dukedoms granted or created during the Union as the Norwegian Constitution of 1814 forbade the creation of new nobility and the Nobility Law of 1st August 1821 set about abolishing noble titles and privileges within two generations.\n\nThe present Dynasty considers that a Ducal Title is for life, even if the Duke (or, nowadays, Duchess) becomes monarch. We saw that the present King for a time around his Accession considered himself to be King and Duke (of Jämtland). However, this wasn't always the case in the beginning.\n\n​\n\n​Ångermanland (Angermannia)\n\n​2015–present Prince Nicolas.

On 10th December 1851, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nPrince August (1831-1873). Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: www.kungahuset.se\n\nOn 16th April 1864 in Altenburg, the Duke married Princess Therese Amalie of Saxe-Altenburg (Ansbach, 21th December 1836 - Haga Palace, Stockholm, 9th November 1914), Duchess of Saxony, eldest daughter of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg. The marriage did not produce issue. In Sweden, his wife was styled Princess Teresia.\n\n​In 1866 he became a Lieutenant, and had progressed to the rank of General by 1872. August did not share his brothers' talents, but he was a kind-hearted, down-to-earth person with a number of eccentric ways. As a young man, he lived periodically at Stjernsund Castle.\n\nThe Prince was very interested in trains and locomotives, and a locomotive was named after him. Since it was commonly thought the Prince was not very bright, this led to the expression \"dummare än tåget\" (lit. \"more stupid than the train\"), an expression still in use in the Swedish language.\n\nPrince August died at the age of 41 of pneumonia at the Stockholm Palace, Stockholm.\n\nAs you will see from the present Prince Gabriel's Coat of Arms in the previous Blog, the Field of the Coat Arms of Dalarnia has changed from red to blue. It is not clear when this happened.\n\n​\n\nHRH Prince ​Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarnia (1916-2012)​ (Count of Wisborg)\n\nHe died at the age of 95 at Ängelholm General Hospital.\n\n​On 29th June 2011, Carl Johann surpassed his elder brother, Sigvard (1907–2002), as the longest-lived of Queen Victoria's male descendants. This record was surpassed by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 13th December 2016. Carl Johann was the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, the last surviving child of Gustaf VI Adolf and the last surviving grandchild of both Gustaf V and Arthur, Duke of Connaught.\n\nIn 1951 Carl Johann was assigned the title Count of Wisborg by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. The Arms of Prince/Princess Bernadotte in the nobility of Luxemborg were granted as per a decree of 2nd July 1951 by the Grand Duchess and her government and issued for Sigvard Prince Bernadotte, Carl Johan Prince Bernadotte and Lennart Prince Bernadotte and their wives. They show the Vasa and Pontercorvo Arms taken from the Inescutcheon of the Swedish Royal Arms signifying the Bernadotte Dynasty tierced in pairle (divided into three sections) with a Pascal Lamb in the bottom third of the Shield. (Although there may be a connection as we will see below, this is not to be confused with the Lamb and Flag of Gotland.)\n\n​Gotland (Gothland)\n\n1859–1888 Prince Oscar from birth, title no longer recognized due to non-royal marriage, died 1953\n\n2014–present Princess Leonore. Already covered in Part One.\n\n​\n\nHRH Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland (1859-1953)​ (Count of Wisborg)\n\nPrince Oscar Carl August Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (15th November 1859 – 4th October 1953) was a Swedish religious activist and the second son of King Oscar II and his consort, Sofia of Nassau.\n\nHe completed his school exams and his naval officer training in 1879, after which he studied at Uppsala. When he married Lady-in-Waiting Ebba Munck of Fulkila in Bournemouth, England on 15th March 1888, he renounced all rights to the Swedish throne.\n\nHe and his wife were deeply religious, and in 1892 Oscar became Chairman of the Swedish YMCA. He was appointed Rear Admiral in 1897.\n\nPrince Oscar photographed in 1903 by Ernest Florman. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: www.kungahuset.se\n\nHe initiated the religious Södertälje Convention, following the model of the English Keswick Convention and in 1927 he donated his holiday home Fridhem on Gotland to the YMCA.\n\nOscar became a widower in 1946, and died in 1953. He was survived by his children Maria, Carl, Sofia, Elsa and Folke – the latter was the famous Count Bernadotte who in 1945 helped to save thousands of prisoners from the German concentration camps.\n\nOscar and Ebba were given new titles as Prince and Princess Bernadotte as of their wedding day. It has never been determined if that was a Swedish title of nobility or another form of unofficial courtesy title (such as some later dynasty members have been given). On 2nd April 1892, he and his wife were given personal noble titles as Prince and Princess Bernadotte when admitted into the nobility of Luxembourg by Oscar's uncle Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, previously Duke of Nassau, and also were then the first to be given the Luxembourgish hereditary title as Count and Countess of Wisborg. (Wisborg was derived from Visborg, castle ruins in Oscar's former Duchy of Gotland.)\n\nOscar's Arms are confirmed by his Stall Plate as Knight of the Order of the Seraphim as tierced in pairle​ Vasa, Pontercorvo and the Pascal Lamb, separated by the yellow cross of Sweden. The Shield, though, is shown ensigned by a Swedish Coronet and not one from Luxembourg. This was the first Count of Wisborg Achievement and it cannot be a coincidence that the choice of a Pascal Lamb would have been based on Oscar's religious beliefs and his former Dukedom of Gotland.\n\n​\n\n​Gästrikland (Gestricland)\n\n​1982–present Princess Madeleine, also Duchess of Hälsingland (same period)​.

Authorage: Wikipedia/Cheposo\n\nPrince Bertil, Duke of Halland (Bertil Gustaf Oskar Carl Eugén; 28th February 1912 – 5th January 1997), was the third son of King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught, as well as the uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nWhen his elder brother, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, died in a plane crash in 1947, Bertil became second in the order of succession and possible regent to his 9-month-old nephew, Carl Gustaf, Gustaf Adolf's only son. The next elder brother/uncle, Sigvard, had already given up his succession rights by marrying a commoner. Carl Gustaf did not come of age until 1964. From 1973 to 1977 Bertil was heir presumptive to his nephew who had now become HM King Carl XVI Gustaf. Even with the births of The King's first children and the change in the Swedish Succession Laws, Bertil remained in the Line to the Throne by special addendum, again a possible regent.\n\nA charismatic man, at home in a uniform as much as in a plain, ordinary shirt, Prince Bertil was a good athlete in his youth, leading to a lifelong commitment to Swedish sport. He was known as the 'Sporting Prince', and in 1947 was elected Chairman of both the Swedish Sports Confederation and the Swedish Olympic Committee.\n\nHRH Prince Bertil of Sweden, Duke of Halland as Swedish Admiral in 1964, photographed by Bergne Porträttstudio AB. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: Pinterest.\n\nUsing the alias \"Monsieur Adrian\", without his royal father knowing, he competed in over a dozen car races around Europe, having begun his fascination with driving very early with a ticket for underage driving.\n\nHe also worked hard to promote Swedish exports and led several industrial delegations around the world.\n\nIn 1943, while the Prince was working as a naval attaché in London, he met Lilian Craig. At that time, Prince Bertil could not marry the daughter of a foreigner without the consent of the king, since he – like his older brother Sigvard and his younger brother Carl Johan – would have lost his succession rights to the Swedish throne. Considering his position as possible regent, the couple lived together for 33 years before they were able to marry. Their private homes were in Sainte-Maxime in France and the Villa Solbacken on Djurgården in Stockholm.\n\nWhen King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the throne and married a commoner himself, Prince Bertil asked his nephew for permission to marry, which was granted. The couple were married in the Royal Chapel at Drottningholm in December 1976.\n\n​Prince Bertil died at the age of 84 at his home, Villa Solbacken.\n\n​\n\nThe Coat of Arms of Halland provided Prince Bertil with possibly the most balanced Achievement of a Swedish Prince with the white Lion on blue complementing and balancing the Folkunga Lion opposite.\n\n​\n\nHalland\n\nThe more peaceful conditions that followed meant that the province could start to develop again.\n\nHalland as a title goes back to the feudal magnates of the early Middle Ages, including Duchess Ingeborg (Princess of Norway) in her own right during the 14th Century.\n\nThe first known Coat of Arms of Halland consisted of a crowned Lion over 10 hearts and was used by Niels II and James I, Counts of (Northern) Halland, and most likely also by Niels I although no examples are preserved from the latter's reign. The colours of this first symbol are uncertain. In 1305, James used a seal showing a lion and 20 hearts. One of the seals used by Duchess Ingeborg of Halland represents Halland by Arms party per fess (split horizontally) with an unspecified colour in chief and a Lion in the larger lower base. This seal dates from 1336, and the figure was repeated in her seal used 1340–1352. A fresco in Søborg Castle, Denmark, dates from her stay there 1331–36 and shows the arms of Halland as a crowned upstanding silver lion on blue.\n\n​The present heraldic Blazon is as follows:\n\nAzure, a Lion rampant Argent langued, armed and dente Gules.\n\nHRH Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland ​(1915-2013)\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland. Authorage: Wikipedia/Cheposo.\n\n​If Bertil had married Lilian while they were young, he would have been forced to relinquish his succession rights to the Throne. He did not feel able to do this due the possibility of acting as regent for a large part of his life. Lilian and the Prince soon became a couple, but this was kept secret from the public for many years.\n\nWhen King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended to the Throne and married a commoner himself, Bertil was given permission to marry Lilian after 33 years together. The couple were married in the Royal Chapel at Drottningholm on 7 December 1976.\n\nLilian became an active member of the Swedish Royal Family and continued to represent them at various engagements and other occasions even after Bertil passed away. She was a very regal lady but with an impish sense of humour. She was a much-loved member of the family as a surrogate mother/grandmother figure, which is why her Alzheimer's and ultimate death hit the family hard.\n\nPrincess Lilian died at the age of 97 at her home, Villa Solbacken shortly before Princess Madeleine's wedding. Madeleine's first-born child, a daughter Leonore, has Lilian as one of her middle names in the Duchess's honour.\n\nAs a commoner, Lilian did not have a Coat of Arms and so, on her marriage, one was drawn up for her by the Swedish Court. She was granted three Fleurs-de-Lys conjoined on a branch in the Swedish colours of blue on yellow. They were placed as an Inescutcheon on her husband's Shield. This is a beautiful pun on her name, but also, lilies, especially lily-of-the-valley, were her favourite flowers forming her wedding bouquet and the wreath placed on her coffin.\n\nPrincess Eugenie's Crown and white lilies of the valley on H.R.H.

Although there were guards, we didn't have to keep too much of a distance and I simply watched a natural family on an afternoon visit. I remember The King's glance towards me as if to say, \"Aunt Lilian would insist on coming here.\" He may have equally meant that it was typical that it was raining...\n\n​​\n\n​Hälsingland (Helsingia)\n\n​1982–present Princess Madeleine from birth, also Duchess of Gästrikland​.

He helped to create the national Swedish landscape style of the 1890s and his works include The Old Castle, The Cloud and The Mill.\n\nIn 1898 he completed his first mural, Haga Moods, for the foyer of the Royal Opera. He also produced frescos for the Royal Dramatic Theatre and Stockholm City Hall. In 1899, he bought Waldemarsudde on Djurgården in Stockholm.\n\nHe was a great admirer of Norwegian nature and frequently visited Christiania (later known as Oslo). With the break-up of the personal union between Sweden and Norway, Eugen was suggested as a possible candidate for the Norwegian Crown. His Father, King Oscar II of Sweden, refused to allow any of his sons to become King of Norway and Eugen himself would not have wanted it as he was more interested in painting than in reigning.\n\nPrince Eugen, photographed by Oscar Halldin in 1909. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: www.kungahuset.se\n\nDuring the 1920s, he often drew inspiration from Italy and from Österlen in Skåne. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1945, King Gustaf V established the Prince Eugen Medal in recognition of outstanding artistic achievements.\n\nPrince Eugen died at Waldemarsudde in 1947. In his will, he left his home and his art collections to the Swedish State and in late June 1948, the Prince Eugen's Waldemarsudde museum was opened to the public.\n\nHe is, to date, the only Prince of the Bernadotte Dynasty to have carried the title Duke of Närke.\n\n​\n\nNärke\n\nGules between four Roses Argent two Arrows in saltire Or points upward pointed Argent.\n\nÖstergötland (East Gothland)\n\n​1829–1872 Prince Oscar from birth, became King 1872, died 1907\n\n1857–1872 Princess Sophia as wife of Prince Oscar above, became his queen 1872, died 1913\n\n1911–1937 Prince Carl from birth, title no longer recognized due to unapproved marriage, died 2003\n\n2012–present Princess Estelle from birth​.

Four sons were born of their marriage, the oldest of whom became King Gustaf V.\n\nSweden underwent a period of industrialisation and rapid technological development. At the same time, the union between Sweden and Norway grew weaker. This period is sometimes known as the Oscarian Period. The political events which led up to the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could hardly have been attained but for the tact and patience of the King himself. He was dethroned on 7th June 1905 by the Norwegian Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26th October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better relations between the two countries were restored before his death.\n\nIt is debatable whether Oscar, who died two years later at the age of 78, did so a bitterly disappointed man or not. He was the last monarch of Sweden to be crowned and can be seen in all his finery at the centre of the top photograph with Swedish Princes at an extraordinary session of the Swedish Parliament in 1905.\n\nThe Province of Östergötland has been looked at in a previous Blog as the title is now carried by Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel's eldest child, Estelle.\n\n​\n\nHRH Prince Carl, Duke of Östergötland (1911-2003) (Prince Carl Bernadotte​)\n\nCarl Gustaf Oscar Fredrik Christian, Prince Bernadotte (10th January 1911 – 27th June 2003) - originally Prince Carl, Duke of Östergötland - was the youngest child and only son of Prince Carl of Sweden and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. To distinguish himself from his father, he was widely known as Carl Junior. He was the brother of Princess Margaretha of Sweden, Queen Astrid of Belgium and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway.\n\nIn 1937, he relinquished his title and his succession rights when he married Countess Elsa von Rosen. That same year, his brother-in-law, HM King Leopold III of Belgium, conferred upon him the Belgian princely title of Prince Bernadotte. Included was the right to a comital title for his male-line descendants. He had one daughter, called Countess Madeleine Bernadotte (born Stockholm, 8th October 1938). His first marriage was dissolved in 1951, and in 1954 he was married for the second time, to Ann Larsson. He married for the third time in 1978, with Norwegian Kristine Rivelsrud.\n\nCarl Bernadotte was at the centre of the Huseby scandal that occurred in the late 1950's in Sweden amidst a great deal of publicity. A complex set of criminal transactions brought Bernadotte and others to court. Bernadotte was acquitted and left Sweden shortly after the trial and spent the rest of his life with his third wife in Spain\n\nPrivate photo of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Östergötland (1911-2003).

First published by Axel Eliasson in Stockholm in the early 1930s/Wikipedia.\n\nCarl quartered the Arms of Östergötland with the Royal Arms in the modern way, in the third Quarter, until his first marriage in 1937 when he had to relinquish his Swedish titles. As Prince Bernadotte he was assigned a Belgian Coat of Arms which quartered a Belgian-looking (or, rather, Brabant-looking) black Lion's head on a yellow/gold Field with, surprisingly, the Ösgtergötland Arms from the title he had just given up! This was surmounted by an Inescutcheon of the Arms of Pontecorvo representing the House of Bernadotte.

He was the oldest of the five children of HM King Oskar I and Josefina of Leuchtenberg.\n\nHe received his first officer's commission from his grandfather, King Carl XIV Johan, on Midsummer's Eve 1841. After his father ascended to the throne in 1844, he was elected chancellor of the universities of Lund and Uppsala, in accordance with an 18th-century tradition. In autumn 1844, he began his studies in Uppsala.\n\nCarl visited the Dutch court in The Hague during 1849 where he fell in love with Princess Louise of the Netherlands whom he married in Stockholm in 1850.\n\nPhoto of HM King Carl XV, photographed by Mathias Hansen in around 1865. The image has been cropped. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: www.kungahuset.se\n\nThe couple had two children, a son, Carl Oscar, who died in infancy and a daughter, Louise/Lovisa, who married the King of Denmark. No subsequent king of Sweden to this day is Carl's descendant. However, his descendants are or have been on the thrones of Denmark, Luxembourg, Greece, Belgium and Norway. A few weeks before Carl's death, his daughter Louise gave birth to her second son who was named after his Grandfather. In 1905 this grandson, Prince Carl of Denmark, was elected to the throne of Norway, thus becoming his maternal grandfather's successor in that country. He assumed the name Haakon VII. The present King, Harald V of Norway, is descended from Carl's Father King Oscar I through both his father and mother (born HRH Princess Märtha of Sweden).\n\nKing Oskar I died on 8th July 1859, and Crown Prince Carl was crowned the following year. He was so down to earth among the public that he shocked many people, but was perhaps Sweden's most popular monarch of all time. Despite this, during his reign he lost so much of the real power that his father and grandfather had wielded that his successor was never able to regain this power.\n\nKing Carl XV died at the age of only 46 without a son and was therefore succeeded by his brother Oscar (HM King Oscar II) as mentioned above.\n\nCarl's Father changed the Swedish/Norwegian Union Coat of Arms as shown in Carl's two Achievements above, as well as changing the flag of the Union, to show more balance between the two countries. I can only assume that the representation of his Duchy's Arms on a white background is an error, even on Carl's Stall Plate as a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim. Scania's Coat of Arms should be shown on a yellow/gold background as the white/silver background is for the Province's main city, Malmö, from where the Province's Arms were taken. The difference was made early on when the Province's Arms were adopted in 1560 in time for the funeral of HM King Carl X.\n\nHRH Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Scania (1882-1973) (HM ​Gustaf VI Adolf)\n\nOscar Fredrik Wilhelm Olaf Gustaf Adolf (11th November 1882 – 15th September 1973) was the eldest son of King Gustaf V and his wife, Victoria of Baden, and was known by his two last names. He was Crown Prince of Sweden for the 43 year reign of his father. When he eventually came to the Throne in 1950, he still had a reign of 23 years himself and was the last king to hold the traditional designation King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends.\n\nGustaf Adolf married the eligible British Princess Margaret of Connaught, Granddaughter of Queen Victoria, in 1905. Her story and Coat of Arms are covered in a previous Blog.\n\nGustaf VI Adolf photographed in 1951. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive. Source: www.kungahuset.se\n\nThey had 5 children - Heir Apparent Gustaf Adolf, Sigvard, Ingrid, Bertil and Carl Johan. (Gustav Adolf jnr (known as Edmund within the family) died in a plane crash before he could become Crown Prince and so Gustav Adolf snr was succeeded by his Grandson, the present King with Prince Bertil acting as possible regent. Ingrid was to marry the King of Denmark making the present Monarchs of Sweden and Denmark first cousins.)\n\nMargaret died in tragic circumstances in 1920 at the age of 38 from sepsis (blood poisoning) after a series of operations following a bout of measles. At the time, she was eight months pregnant with her sixth child and the baby was lost.\n\n​\n\nThree years after Margaret's death Gustaf Adolf married Lady Louise Mountbatten. ​She was the Great-Granddaughter of Queen Victoria through Princess Alice and would eventually become Queen of Sweden in 1950.\n\nGustaf Adolf's reputation as a \"professional amateur professor\" was widely known and he was a devoted archaeologist. He was admitted to the British Academy for his work in botany in 1958 and was an expert on the rhododendron. Gustaf VI Adolf participated in archaeological expeditions in China, Greece, Korea and Italy, and founded the Swedish Institute in Rome. He had an enormous private library consisting of 80,000 volumes and – more impressively – he hadactually read the main part of them! He had an interest in specialist literature on Chinese art and East Asian history.\n\nHe ​maintained wide, lifelong interests in sports, enjoying tennis, golf, and fly fishing. He was president of the Swedish Olympic Committee and the Swedish Sports Confederation from their foundations, and these positions were then taken over by his sons in succession.\n\nNot long before his death at the age of 90, he approved the constitutional changes which removed the last traces of political power from the Swedish monarch.\n\nDuring the earlier part of the 20th Century, after the dissolution of the Union with Norway, the Quarterings for Dukes became most awkward with a fifth Quarter! Gustaf Adolf's Grandson, the present King, appears to be the last to have this arrangement.\n\n​\n\nHRH Crown Princess Louise, Duchess of Scania (1889-1965)\n\n​(Lady Louise Mountbatten - HM QUeen Louise)\n\nLady Louise Alexandra Marie Irene Mountbatten (13th July 1889 – 7th March 1965), was born Princess Louise of Battenberg to Prince Louis of Battenberg, who was Admiral of the Fleet in the United Kingdom, and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria through Princess Alice. Louise was a sister of Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and of Princess Alice of Battenberg, who was the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nDuring the First World War, she volunteered with the Red Cross and served as a nurse from March 1915 to July 1917.\n\nPortrait of Louise in 1926, photographed by Jaeger.

Princess Louise of Battenberg thereby became Lady Louise Mountbatten, which remained her name until her marriage in 1923. By her own account and that of many others, her marriage to Gustaf Adolf was a happy one despite the fact that the couple never had any children together who survived birth.\n\nIn 1950, Louise became Queen when her husband ascended to the throne. But Louise has been described as a staunch democrat and a practical person who disliked the attention she received.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Queen Louise suffered a couple of minor heart attacks. Her health deteriorated significantly during the autumn of 1964, and she was taken ill following the Nobel Banquet in December, which was to be her final public appearance. She died the following year at the age of 75 at Saint Göran Hospital, in Stockholm.\n\nLouise's Coat of Arms as Crown Princess follow her husband's but unusually with her paternal Arms (Hesse and Battenberg/Mountbatten) in the second and fourth Quarters. Her Maternal Arms (those of Princess Alice) are therefore shown alone on her Inescutcheon. When she became Queen the Inescutcheon became her full Arms, maternal and paternal combined, on the King's Shield.\n\nEqually surprisingly, the Inescutcheon for both of Gustav Adolf's wives was a Shield shape instead of an Oval.

He was the only child of Jean Baptiste Bernadotte and Désirée Clary. The name Oscar was chosen by Napoleon after one of the heroes in the Ossian cycle of poems. When electing the successor to the throne in Örebro in 1810, it was deemed important that the future king should also have a son and heir. A portrait of the young Oscar was circulated at the Parliamentary Session in Örebro to assist with the candidature of his father (who was born Jean Bernadotte and made Sovereign Prince of Pontecorvo by Napoleon).\n\nWhen his Father became King of the Union as Carl XIV Johan in 1818, Oscar became Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway. He married Joséphine of Leuchtenberg at Stockholm Cathedral first by proxy at the Leuchtenberg Palace in Munich on 22th May 1823 and then in person at a wedding ceremony in Stockholm on 19th June 1823. Joséphine's surname was de Beauharnais as she was the paternal Granddaughter of her namesake, Napoleon's first wife. Her Father had been made Duke of Leuchtenberg.\n\nPortrait of Oscar as Crown Prince by Joseph Karl Stieler (1781–1858), 1823. Collection: Royal Palace, Stockholm. Current location: Bernadotte Apartments.\n\nAfter the death of his Father in 1844, Oscar assumed leadership of the country. As King, he was less liberal than the opposition had imagined and, after the political turbulence of 1848, he became almost conservative.\n\nKing Oscar I's hope that the Swedish-Norwegian union would be seen as a single kingdom came to nothing. Towards the end of his reign, he is said to have complained that the Union was unsuccessful, and could not be otherwise in the future.\n\nOscar I died at the Royal Palace of Stockholm in 1859 following a long period of illness and was succeeded in turn by his two elder sons as Carl XV and Oscar II.\n\nOscar was granted the Duchy of Södermanland on 5th November 1810 when he was made Prince of Sweden and Norway. This was done by his adoptive Grandfather, the childless King Carl XIII. This was unusual in that this had been Carl XIII's own Dukedom and means that the idea that a title reverted to the Crown still existed then, especially when, in his turn, Oscar granted this same Dukedom to his Grandson, Carl Oscar whose Blog follows. With this head start, Södermanland is the most granted Province with four Dukes including the present Prince Alexander, son of Prince Carl Philip. Oscar quartered Södermanland with the Swedish Crowns, Folkung's Lion and Norway's Lion and was the first Prince to do so as the personal Union between Sweden and Norway had occurred during the reign of the childless King Carl XIII, whom Oscar's Father succeeded. The Quarters in saltire (diagonal cross) look well-balanced, but still put Sweden in prime position.\n\nNaturally, as the first Prince of the new Bernadotte Dynasty, Oscar was the first Prince to carry the Vasa/Pontecorvo Inescutcheon which has gone through a number of changes. (His Father, as Crown Prince, had only carried an Inescutcheon of Pontecorvo.) It started off a simple black Bird (raven = Corvo in Italian) sitting on a simple brick Bridge (bridge = Ponte in Italian) but under Charles Bernadotte as Sovereign Prince had become an Napoleonic Eagle on a very much grander Bridge. Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century, chosen as a symbol of Sweden's 'eternal existence'. The constellation of the Great Bear or Plough is called Charles's Wain (derived from churl's or men's wagon) in Sweden. For a period the eagle reverted to black but appears to have gone back to the Napoleonic gold at the time of the dissolution of the Union of Sweden and Norway in 1905.\n\nOscar's Father - Jean Baptiste Bernadotte who became King Carl XIV John - was never granted a Swedish Dukedom, but was in turn Prince of Sweden, Crown Prince of Sweden and then Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway.\n\nHRH Prince Carl Oscar, Duke of Södermanland ​(1852-1854)\n\nCarl Oscar Vilhelm Frederik (14th December 1852 – 13th March 1854) was the only son of HM King Carl XV (who was Crown Prince at the time) and Lovisa of the Netherlands. During his short life, Carl Oscar was second in line to the throne of Sweden and Norway, after his father, and was also Duke of Södermanland. He was granted this Dukedom by his Grandfather, King Oscar I, whose own Dukedom it had been as Prince.\n\nHe had one elder sibling, Louise of Sweden who would become Queen of Denmark.\n\nHe contracted measles in February 1854 and was incorrectly prescribed cold baths, which caused pneumonia. Carl Oscar died at the age of just 15 months, as a result of which his uncle Oscar eventually inherited the throne as King Oscar II.\n\n​\n\nHRH Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland ​(1884-1965)\n\nCarl Wilhelm Ludvig (17th June 1884 – 5th June 1965) was the second son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife Victoria of Baden.\n\nIt was traditional for the second child in the royal family to follow a naval career. On his twentieth birthday in 1904, he became a Second Lieutenant in the Navy. Wilhelm was an excellent sailor, and advanced to the rank of Commodore, eventually becoming Rear Admiral.\n\nIn 1908 he married the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, with whom he had a son, Lennart. Their marriage was not a happy one and was dissolved in 1914.\n\nPhotograph of Prince Wilhelm dating from 1926. Photo from the Bernadotte Library's archive.

The Prince published books of poetry including Silhouettes of Reality (1955) and collections of short stories including Black Novels (1924), as well as global travelogues and books about Swedish nature. He also made short films. Between 1920 and 1949 he was involved in making almost 250 newsreels.\n\n​He lived at Stenhammar Palace in Flen (situated in his Ducal Province, Södermanland) until he died in his sleep, from a heart attack, just 12 days before his 81st birthday.\n\nWilhelm's Coat of Arms changed as above with the dissolution of the Union between Sweden and Norway.\n\n​Uppland (Upland)\n\n​1827–1852 Prince Gustaf from birth, died with title\n\n1907–1934 Prince Sigvard from birth, title no longer recognized due to unapproved marriage, died 2002\n\n​\n\nHRH Prince Gustaf, Duke of Uppland ​(1827-52)\n\nFrans Gustaf Oscar (18th June 1827 – 24th September 1852) was the second son of King Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg.

He was consequently known as the \"Song Prince\". More than 50 of his compositions have been preserved: marches, romances and ballads. His The Student Song (Studentsången) is traditionally sung at the graduation festivities for gymnasium students, and his Spring Song (Vårsång) is often performed by men's choruses on Walpurgis night.\n\nA portrait of the \"Song Prince\", Prince Gustaf, shortly before his death in 1852.

They had three children, the oldest of whom eventually became his successor, King Gustaf VI Adolf. With a reign of almost 43 years, he was the second-longest reigning monarch in the history of Sweden (after Magnus Eriksson) and also the oldest ever.\n\nHe was also the first Swedish king to refrain from being crowned, which had been the custom in Sweden since the 13th century.\n\nCrown Prince Gustaf photographed in 1906 by Ernest Florman.

This remains controversial to date. Although he is not known to have shown much support for fascism or radical nationalism, his pro-German and anti-Communist stance was well known also in World War I.\n\nHis personal interests included music, art and sports, and he was a noted tennis player under the pseudonym Mr. G.\n\nHis health deteriorated after his 90th birthday, and he died at Drottningholm Palace at the age of 92. His funeral at Riddarholm Church was the last royal burial to be held there. His 68-year-old son Gustav succeeded him as King Gustav VI Adolf.\n\nFollowing his death, Gustaf was implicated in the Haijby affair.

But, as we have seen above, this is not a full Province and the Cabinet objected.\n\nHaving been Duke of Norrland for a few hours [Trond Norén Isaksen relates], the newborn [Gustaf] transformed into Duke of Värmland, a title suggested by two of his ministers.\n\nEvidently, the Arms of Värmland experienced a change between Gustaf coming to the Throne, when he dropped the Värmland Quarter, and the grant of the Province as the Dukedom for Prince Carl Philip, the present Duke. Gustaf's Quarter shows a red Eagle on yellow, whereas Carl Philip's shows a blue Eagle on white. The Eagle on the Regimental Colours for the Province show various colour combinations - black on yellow and even white on deep yellow!

Victoria, called him \"my much loved child of grief\". Like the British King George and Queen Mary's youngest child, Prince John, Erik lived an extremely secluded life, and very rarely attended large social gatherings. Every two weeks, he was allowed a trip to the capital, during which he sometimes could be seen visiting the opera.\n\nPrince Erik, photographed by Ernst Florman in 1907.

Prince Gustaf Adolf was created Duke of Västerbotten and remains the only Swedish Royal Duke ever to carry that Province as his title.\n\nHe attended Lundsberg School in Värmland from 1918 until 1924, and took his school exams at the Royal Palace of Stockholm in 1925. He then carried out his officer's training and studied at Uppsala University.\n\nHis honorary roles and chairmanships included chairing the International Scout Committee, the Swedish Olympic Committee, the Swedish Sports Confederation and the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management.\n\nIn 1932 he married Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and they had five children: Margaretha, Birgitta, Désirée, Christina and Carl Gustaf, the present King.\n\nGustaf Adolf participated in the 1936 Olympic Games with the Swedish riding team, but was disqualified when his horse Aida refused to jump over the 13th obstacle in the show jumping event. The Prince was also an elite fencer with sabre and épée. In terms of prizes and awards, he is still by far the most successful royal Swedish athlete.\n\nThe Prince was killed in an air crash at Kastrup Airport, Copenhagen in 1947. The plane plummeted nose-first to the ground, where it exploded on impact. All 22 people on board the plane were killed. Also aboard the ill-fated flight was American singer and actress Grace Moore. An investigation found that, short of time, the plane's captain had failed to perform the final pre-flight check list properly and took off not realising that a gust lock on an elevator was still in place.\n\nGustaf Adolf was only 40 years old. His son, the present King, took over his Father's position as second in line to the Throne at the age of 9 months. Gustaf Adolf's brother Bertil would stand by in case he had to act as regent for his nephew but never did. Gustaf Adolf and Sibylla's other children were all girls and were collectively known as the Haga Princesses after the Palace they were all born in.\n\nAs confirmed by his Stall Plate as Knight of the Order of the Seraphim, Gustav Adolf placed the Arms of his Province, Västerbotten, in a fifth Quarter at the bottom of his Shield in the rather clumsy arrangement of the time.\n\n​\n\nA portrait of the heir to the throne and his family, 1946.

She was the daughter of Prince Carl Edward of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (a Grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert through their youngest son Leopold, who is covered in an earlier Blog) and Victoria Adelheid of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\nIn November 1931, Sibylla was in London to attend the wedding of Lady May Abel Smith as a bridesmaid. One of the other bridesmaids was Ingrid of Sweden, who introduced Sibylla to her brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf. Their engagement was announced at Callenberg Castle in Coburg 16th June 1932.\n\nThe couple had a civil marriage on 19th October 1932 and a church marriage on 20th October at St Maurice's Church in Coburg. From 1932, the couple lived at Haga Palace in Solna where all of their five children were born.\n\nSibylla became a widow in 1947 when Gustaf Adolf died in the plane crash outlined above. Their only son, Carl Gustaf, became second-in-line to the throne at the age of nine months and, later, Crown Prince at the age of four. In 1950, Sybilla moved from Haga to the Royal Palace of Stockholm. During the summers, she stayed at Solliden. During these years, she developed an interest in environmental issues.\n\nAfter her stepmother-in-law, Queen Louise, died in 1965, Sibylla became the highest ranking woman in the royal family. She took over duties in support of her father-in-law, King Gustaf VI Adolf. During these years, she enjoyed somewhat more popularity as her humour and sense of self-irony became more known and appreciated. She continued with the so-called \"Democratic Ladies Lunches\" for career women instigated by Queen Louise in 1962 as a replacement for court presentation.\n\nSibylla died in Stockholm of cancer at the age of 64 less than a year before her son ascended the Throne.\n\n​As Duchess of Västerbotten, Princess Sibylla showed her paternal Arms of Saxony on an Inescutcheon in the middle of her husband's Arms as the Duke.

The couple also had a son, Prince Carl Junior. Carl and Ingeborg's family was known for being conventional and harmonious.\n\nIn 1905, during the political struggle in which Norway obtained its independence from Sweden, Prince Carl was seriously considered as a candidate for the Norwegian crown but his Father refused. The eventual King of Norway was a Prince Carl of Denmark, whose son, Olaf, would, ironically, marry Carl of Sweden's daughter Märta, as mentioned above.\n\nPhotograph of HRH Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, 1929.

Photographer unknown.\n\nIn 1906, Carl Senior became Chairman of the Board of the Swedish Red Cross, which brought him world fame. He became an honorary Doctor of Medicine in 1917, and an honorary member of the Swedish Society of Medicine in 1921. He retired from the board of the Swedish Red Cross in 1945, whereupon King Gustaf V instituted the Prince Carl Medal for meritorious humanitarian efforts in his honour.\n\nCarl Senior lived to be 90 and passed away in Stockholm.\n\n​Before the dissolution of the Union between Sweden and Norway, Carl's Coat of Arms was the cumbersome version of the times. After 1907 his revised Arms were a simpler version with three Quarters - Sweden, Folkung and Västergötland - as confirmed on his Stall Plate as Knight of the Order of the Seraphim.\n\n​His Duchy of Västergötland was revived for the present Crown Princess, Victoria.\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Denmark (1878-1958)\n\n​(HRH The Duchess of Västergötland)\n\nIngeborg Charlotte Caroline Frederikke Louise (2nd August 1878 – 12th March 1958) was the daughter of King Frederick VIII of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden, making her the Granddaughter of King Carl XV.\n\nAnna Lerche and Marcus Mandal, in their excellent story of the Scandinavian Royal Families A Royal Family, 2003, tell of Ingeborg and Carl's engagement.\n\nDuring a dinner at Charlottenlund Palace [in Denmark], when the Swedish Prince Carl was visiting, Christian IX suddenly rose and announced his eighteen year old grandchild Ingeborg's engagement to the thirty-six year old Swedish Prince Carl. Ingeborg sat there and could not believe her ears, for it was the first she had heard about her betrothal. Very diplomatically, Carl said to the Danish monarch that it should have been the next day. He wanted the opportunity to propose first.\n\nIngeborg was much loved by both her family and the public for her happy, humorous and informal nature. King Oskar II is said to have called her the family's \"little ray of sunshine\". She carried out many official duties when Queen Sofia scaled back her public appearances and Crown Princess Viktoria spent long periods abroad for health reasons.\n\nThe first King of modern Norway, who took the regnal name of Haakon VII, would turn out to be her brother, Prince Carl of Denmark, rather than her husband, Prince Carl of Sweden.\n\nShe lived an informal and harmonious family life and they were known as \"The Happy Family\". In the historic traditions of the Danish Royal Family, the children were given a simple upbringing and were expected to learn household tasks. They were, for example, given a real stove in their play cottage on which they cooked real food.\n\nPrincess Ingeborg passed away in Stockholm, at the age of 79.\n\nIngeborg's Stall Plate as Knight (Lady) of the Order of the Seraphim confirms that she placed the simple Arms of Denmark - the three blue Lions amongst the red Hearts - on an Inescutcheon on to her husband's simplified Arms.\n\nThe happy and informal Ingeborg brings this Blog and our look at Swedish Royal Ducal titles to a close.\n\nIn conclusion, apart from remarks made in the previous Blog about Swedish Royal Duchies and the first few grants of the Bernadotte Dynasty, namely the reuse of the province of Södermanland, there really doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to the designation of the Ducal Titles. It is a practical way of providing both a historical link between the Royal Family and the country, and also a heraldic means of difference and cadency.\n\nDucal Coronet for Princes and Princesses of Sweden. Authorage: Wikipedia/Tom Lemmens (after Sodacan)\n\n​The Swedish title of hertig (from the German word Herzog, meaning duke) came into use during the 13th Century with Birger Jarl, who played a pivotal role in the formation of the country of Sweden, and his son Prince Magnus. Birger Jarl is also traditionally attributed with founding the Swedish capital, Stockholm in around 1250. Birger used the Latin title of Dux Sweorum which means Duke of Sweden. The design of his Coronet combined features used by continental European and English dukes.\n\nThe title replaced the traditional Nordic Jarl, which could loosely be translated as prince, although the word is etymologically close to the English word earl.\n\nA monarch, born as a prince or princess, will receive a ducal title as well. As we will see with the present King, the title is no longer used once on the Throne. As with all other ducal titles, the title only becomes available again once that monarch passes away.\n\n​In this first installment, we will look at the present Royal Family.\n\nThe Swedish Royal Family in front of Solliden's castle on Öland. Jonas: Jonas Ekströmer / Kungahuset.se (Kungahuset on Instagram 24th July 2017/Hello Magazine)\n\n​Jämtland (HM King Carl XVI Gustaf)\n\nJämtland is a historical province in the centre of Sweden and was originally an autonomous peasant republic, its own nation with its own law, currency and parliament. However, it lacked a public administration and is nowadays only semi-seriously looked on as an autonomous republic.\n\nHaving said that, Jämtland has been fought over by Norway and Sweden. During the period of unrest in Jämtland's history (1563–1677) it shifted alignment between the two states no fewer than 13 times. This in itself is symbolized by the province's coat of arms where Jämtland, represented by a silver Elk, is threatened from the east (an Eagle) and from the west (a Dog/Wolf). (Although not officially stipulated in the Blazon (or description) the Elk's Antlers are usually shown as red.)\n\nPrince Carl Gustaf was granted the title of the Duke of Jämtland at his christening. His father, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten was killed in an plane crash on 26th January 1947, at Copenhagen Airport. His father's death left the nine-month-old prince second in line for the throne, behind his grandfather, the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. When his great-grandfather Gustaf V died in 1950, the four-year-old prince became the Heir Apparent to the Swedish Throne.\n\nAs has been mentioned, a Swedish Royal Duke or Duchess, even the Crown Prince or, as we shall see, the Crown Princess, quarters the Arms of their Dukedom with the Royal Arms. When Carl Gustaf was a child, the Arms of Sweden and Folkung were split into two not four and the Ducal Arms appeared in a third portion at the bottom. All was still divided by the yellow cross, which, legend has it, 12th-century King Eric IX saw in the sky as he landed in Finland during the First Swedish Crusade in 1157 and which is also the basis of the Swedish flag.\n\nThis version looks most awkward to me and the present system, as we will see, looks better.\n\nCarl Gustaf ceased to use these arms in 1973 when he came to the Throne. He also ceased to use the Ducal title, as is customarily the case, although it is contested that he was called King of Sweden and Duke of Jämtland at the time of his accession. Queen Silvia, who married Carl Gustaf in 1976 after he had become King, was therefore never Duchess of Jämtland and no queen consort carries on the Ducal title either.\n\nVästergötland (Crown Princess Victoria)\n\nVästergötland is situated in the southwest of Sweden. Its largest town is in actual fact Sweden's second city, Gothenburg.\n\nVästergötland was granted its arms at the time of the funeral of King Gustaf Vasa in 1560.\n\nPer bend sinister Sable and Or, a Lion rampant counterchanged langued and armed Gules between two Mullets Argent in the Sable field.\n\nOne theory for the Coat of Arms (Elias Granqvist, 18 February 2001/www.crwflags.com) claims that Lions in shields parted per bend sinister were borne by both Tyrgils Knutsson and his relative Knut Magnusson, both of whom were important Swedish men in the middle ages who lived in Västergötland. It is placed, as is now the general rule, in the third Quarter of the shield, replacing the repeat of the Folkung Coat of Arms to produce a more balanced Achievement.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria was not without her controversy when she was a child. Although she was The King and Queen's first child, born on 14th July 1977, she was not automatically Crown Princess as daughters were still excluded from the Throne. ​Her brother, Carl Philip, was born two years later and from his birth on 13th May 1979 to 31st December 1979 he was Crown Prince. However, the Government made an amendment to the Act of Succession of 1810 that year which meant that the throne would be inherited by the monarch's eldest child regardless of gender, but also made it retroactive. Carl Philip was therefore stripped of the title of Crown Prince to the King's great annoyance and Victoria became Crown Princess on 1st January 1980.\n\nShe therefore also needed a Ducal title as she would need a Coat of Arms of her own. Princesses had until then simply used the Swedish Coat of Arms on an oval Shield and every princess' Arms were therefore the same. Victoria was granted Västergötland. As Duchies were granted at or shortly after the christening, the question is whether Carl Philip would have been granted Västergötland instead as the change to the law was presumably being discussed around about the time of his Christening in the August.\n\nVictoria, as the first Royal Duchess in her own right in the modern age, therefore also became Duchess of Västergötland as well as Crown Princess on 1st January 1980 at the age of three-and-a-half.\n\nCoat of arms of HRH Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nOn 19th June 2010 Crown Princess Victoria married commoner Daniel Westling. As the first female Heir Apparent there was the great question as to what her husband would be known as. There had been three queens regnant in Sweden's history, but none of them gave any clear precedent as none of the husband's had been commoners.\n\nThe Swedish Royal Court announced that Westling would become \"Prince Daniel\" and \"Duke of Västergötland\". He would not be Duke in his own right but simply take on the title of his wife. As was further announced the month before the wedding, Westling was made a prince of Sweden and was granted the style Royal Highness on his wedding day, making him an official member of the Swedish Royal Family. He also emerged from Stockholm Cathedral after the wedding ceremony wearing the Ribbon and Star of the Order of the Seraphim. He will remain a prince when his wife ascends the Throne, just like Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom.\n\nThey are currently generally known as the Crown Princess Couple.\n\nOn the subject of Prince Daniel's Coat of Arms the situation couldn't have been simpler once, as with any royal spouse who has been born a commoner, he was granted a Coat of Arms himself. This was placed on an Inescutcheon on top of his Wife's Coat of Arms just as HM The Queen's had on top of the King's.\n\nThe Coat of Arms and his Monogram were unveiled by the Swedish Royal Court on 15th June 2010:\n\nThe National Archives were commissioned by the Royal Court in autumn 2009 with producing proposals for a coat of arms and a monogram. H.M. The King has now confirmed the future Duke's coat of arms and monogram, which were drawn by the National Archives' heraldic artist Vladimir A Sagerlund and designed by State Herald Henrik Klackenberg, working closely with Mr Daniel Westling.\n\nThe coat of arms has four fields with an inescutcheon, and is crowned with a prince's crown. The four fields depict the lesser national coat of arms (fields 1 and 4), the coat of arms of the House of Folkung (field 2) and the coat of arms of Västergötland (field 3). The inescutcheon shows Mr Daniel Westling's personal coat of arms, which is derived from the coat of arms of Ockelbo Municipality. The fir twig line, which divides up the shield, and the hammer are found in the municipal coat of arms, but in a different position and in different colours.\n\nThe partition in the Arms refers to the large forests of the region and the hammer refers to the iron works. The actual Arms of Ockelbo Municipality are white and green, and divided vertically rather than at an angle.\n\nTwo questions remain: Whether Prince Daniel will retain his Ducal title when his Wife becomes Queen and whether he will retain the Ducal Quarter, or not, as a consequence. As is usual in these situations, the questions will probably only be answered if and as the matters arise.\n\nÖstergötland (Princess Estelle)\n\nÖstergötland is in the south of Sweden and, as the name would imply, lies to the east of Estelle's Mother's Duchy of Västergötland. The Province is full of fairytale castles, the Göta Canal and the oldest wooden church in Sweden at Tidersrum. The main city is Linköping.\n\nFrom 1560, Östergötland was represented with two separate Coats of Arms until 1884 when the current one was granted. The blazon reads as follows:\n\nGules a Griffin with Dragon Wings, Tail and Tongue rampantOr armed, beaked, langued and membered Azure between four RosesArgent.\n\nThese Arms are placed in the Third Quarter of Estelle's Coat of Arms which are carried on an oval Shield. Her Duchy, as well as her full names, were announced at a cabinet meeting on the day after she was born, as has become customary.\n\nIt is believed that Estelle was named after American-born Estelle Bernadotte who married Count Folke Bernadotte, a Swedish member of a United Nations mediating team and who was assassinated in Israel. At the time of the announcement, King Carl XVI Gustaf said that, \"...the name is very close to the heart of her mother and the family.\" Folke was the son of Prince Oscar Bernadotte who was, in turn, the son of King Oscar II. Oscar Bernadotte had contracted a marriage with Swedish noblewoman Ebba Munck af Fulkila, who wasn't of royal birth, and therefore had to give up his Swedish princely title and his Dukedom of Gotland.\n\nEstelle is the first first-born Princess with the right to inherit the Crown of Sweden which cannot be superseded by a later brother. She remains second in line to the Throne, though, after her Mother. It is believed that she will carry on the Dynasty of Bernadotte, even though members of the Swedish Royal Family have a traditional exemption from the law which requires all Swedes to have a surname. Her Father, Prince Daniel, officially and legally adopted his wife's surname of Bernadotte after marrying her.\n\nThe Duchy, as we will see in a later Blog on the subject, has been granted before. One holder of the title was HM King Oscar II, Oscar Bernadotte's Father, before he became King.\n\n​\n\nSkåne (Prince Oscar)\n\nSkåne (or Scania in English) is the southernmost province in Sweden. It's largest city is the country's third largest, namely Malmö, which is a heavily industrialized city. Having said that, the Scania AB heavy vehicle manufacturer does not have its Headquarters in the Province even though its logo carries the Skåne Griffin's Head and the bicycle-manufacturing half from the 1911 merger used to be based there. The area has also benefited from the building of 3 bridges over to Denmark, especially the Öresund Bridge.\n\nThe official Blazon of Skåne's quite striking Coat of Arms is as follows:\n\nOr, a Griffin's Head erased Gules, crowned, armed and langued Azure.\n\nSkåne was under Danish rule until the 1658 Treaty of Roklide ceded it and all Danish lands east of Øresund to the Swedish Crown. The sudden death of HM King Carl X Gustaf of Sweden in 1660 meant that a Coat of Arms for the Province became imperative for the funeral procession. Malmö had been granted a Coat of Arms in 1437 under the rule of Eric of Pomerania, namely the Head of a Pomeranian Griffin, only on a white background. The background (or Field) was changed to yellow for the Province and the Crown, Beak and Tongue to blue.\n\nSkåne is also distinctive heraldically as it has its own Nordic or Scandinavian Cross flag, with the vertical arm of the Cross displaced towards the flagpole rather than being in the centre of the Flag. It is not just a Banner of the Arms and is itself official as it is flown by the Council. Not only does it combine the main Colours of the Coat of Arms - red and yellow - it combines the red Field of the Danish Flag and the yellow Cross of the Swedish Flag to reflect the disputes over the region over the years.\n\nThere is a dispute as to when it was created, but it is safe to say that it emerged towards the end of the 19th Century and became established around 1902.​\n\nOfficial Nordic or Scandinavian Cross Flag of Skåna. Authorage: Wikipedia/GeMet.\n\nPrince Oscar was born on 2nd March 2016 as the younger child and only son of Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel. He is third in line to the Swedish Throne after his Mother and elder Sister, who, after the succession laws of 1980, he does not displace.\n\nHis names and title were announced in Council the day after his birth by his grandfather, the King.There have been two previous Dukes of Scania in the House of Bernadotte: Charles XV and Gustaf VI Adolf (Prince Oscar's great-great-grandfather and the King's own Grandfather and direct predecessor). Whilst Oscar's elder Sister's Dukedom reflects their Mother's, it might be thought that the King had reserved this seemingly important Dukedom for his eldest Grandson who, had things been different, might have become king. (Don't forget that all Swedish princes (and only princes), as well as receiving the Order of the Seraphim at birth, also receive the Order of Charles XIII. However, they cannot wear the Order's insignia unless they are Freemasons.)\n\nAs can be seen above, Skåne's Coat of Arms is shown in the third Quarter of Prince Oscar's Shield.\n\n​\n\nVärmland (Prince Carl Philip)\n\nVärmland is a rather mountainous and lake-filled Province on the western edge of central Sweden. The eastern part, away from the border with Norway, has a mining district and the area is rich in minerals, notably iron ore. The Province was sparsely populated and took a while to gain importance. It was, however, disputed by neighbouring Provinces, has been the battleground for numerous conflicts with neighbouring Norway and was strategic in World War II.\n\nIt's capital and largest city is, ironically considering the Prince who carries the Province's Dukedom, Karlstad. The agreement to dissolve the union between Norway and Sweden was negotiated and signed there in 1905.\n\nThe Blason for the Province's Coat of Arms is below. However, background information seems to be scarce, if not non-existant!\n\nArgent, an Eagle displayed Azure beaked, langued and membered Gules.\n\nAs has been mentioned above, at the time of her birth Prince Carl Philip's elder sister did not feature in the Line of Succession to the Swedish Throne as this was restricted by male primogeniture and all princesses were excluded. When Carl Philip was born, on 13th May 1979, he was therefore immediately Crown Prince. He was baptised on 31st August the same year and was also given his Duchy shortly afterwards, maybe because of the connection between his first name and the name of the Province's capital, Karlstad.\n\nHowever, the succession laws were changed by the Swedish Government, coming into effect on 1st January 1980. These were, surprisingly, made retroactive with the result that Carl Philip not only lost his title of Crown Prince which he had held for 7 months, but also lost his position in the Line of Succession to his elder sister who will become Sweden's next monarch.\n\nHis Dukedom remained the same and the Värmland Eagle features in the third Quarter of Carl Philip's Coat of Arms.\n\n​\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH Princess Sofia, Duchess of Värmland. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nOn 13th June 2015 Carl Philip married the former model and reality television contestant Sofia Hellqvist. The previous month the Royal Court had announced that she would receive the title of Princess of Sweden in her own right, although, as the spouse of a Prince, she ranks below her royal-born sisters-in-law.\n\nHer Coat of Arms is shown here and follows the usual pattern of, firstly, being shown on an oval Shield. The main Arms are those of her husband as she also takes on his ducal title. Her personal Coat of Arms is shown on an oval Inescutcheon in the middle.\n\n​As pointed out in a previous Blog, Sofia was not armigerous and the Grant for her personal Coat of Arms took a long while coming. It was only made public 2 years after the wedding!\n\n​The Arms are based on those of her homeland, Älvdalen and are the simplified background to the locality's Coat of Arms which amounts to a Silver Field, a Red (Gules) triple-topped mountain and a Chief Wavy Azure (Blue) which would appear to represent a blue sky. The sythe and crossbow from Älvdalen's version have been removed for the Princess.\n\n​\n\nSödermanland (Prince Alexander)\n\nSödermanland is bounded by Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea, and the other Provinces Östergötland, Närke, Västmanland and Uppland. The Province's name means \"Southern man land\" and was used as a directional reference in relation to the lake.\n\nThe terrain is flat and largely consists of water filled hollows and covered with woods on the heights.\n\nThe nation's capital, Stockholm, is shared between Södermanland and Uppland.\n\nOr, a Griffin rampant Sable beaked, langued, membered and armed Gules.\n\nAlexander was born on 19th April 2016. His full names, Alexander Erik Hubertus Bertil, and his ducal title were announced in Council by his Grandfather, The King, two days later.\n\nAs shown above, Alexander's Coat of Arms follows the usual pattern and the black Södermanland Griffin appears in the third Quarter of his Shield.\n\n​\n\nDalarna (Prince Gabriel)\n\nGabriel's Dukedom of Dalarna lies directly north of his Father's Dukedom of Värmland.\n\nThe word \"Dalarna\" means \"the dales\" or \"valleys\". The area is a popular holiday destination with good fishing lakes, beautiful camping grounds and deep forests. Many Swedes own or rent a second residence in Dalarna with vegetable gardens and apple trees. Summer festivals and dances are held in mid-June. Dalarna is a region full of historical associations, possessing strong local characteristics, especially its people, and enjoys a rich and unique folk culture.\n\nThe high level of calcium in the soil favours horse breeding - the Dala Horse is a traditional carved, painted wooden statue or toy - and the Stora Kopparberg (\"Great Copper Mountain\") in Falun has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nThe Province's Coat of Arms, which appeared as early as 1525, is ​as follows:\n\nAzure, two Dalecarlian Arrows Or in saltire point upwards pointed Argent and in chief a Crown of the second.\n\nPrince Gabriel was born on 31st August 2017. His full name, Gabriel Carl Walther and his ducal title were announced in Council by his Grandfather, The King, 4 days later.\n\n​\n\nHälsingland and Gästrikland (Princess Madeleine)\n\nHälsingland and Gästrikland are historic Provinces situated north of Stockholm at the southern end of the equally \"traditional\" Norrland region. Most of the area forms the basis of the modern Gävleborg County. For that reason it suddenly becomes logical as to why they are together as a duchy, although the County's Arms (above) show the two Provinces round the other way.\n\nSable, a Goat rampant Or attired and hoofed Gules.\n\nThis was granted, again, in 1560 when the Province was known for its large-scale goat breeding. In another surprise, though, the Province's symbolic animal is now the lynx!\n\n​Neighbouring Gästrikland, a small Procince south of Hälsingland, is often called the Gateway to Norrland. The South and East are largely agricultural and the North and West are largely hilly. The north-western corner is the home to Gästrikland's highest mountain, the Lustigknopp (literally \"Funny-hood\"). One tenth of the Province's area is home to small lakes.\n\nGästrikland's Arms are blasonned as follows:\n\nArgent Hurty an Elk statant Gules attired and hoofed Or.\n\nHaving said that Princess Madeleine's title of Duchess of two Provinces may not actually be surprising as Hälsingland and Gästrikland have a history of being joined together, it may be surprising that neither Province had been a duchy before. It is certainly the first time since the early 17th Century that a member of the Swedish Royal Family has received more than one ducal title.\n\nThere is one other innovation with Princess Madeleine. Up until her birth on 10th June 1982, the ducal title was not announced until the time of the baby's christening or shortly after. Madeleine's full name and ducal title were announced in Council by her Father, The King, shortly after her birth. This has become the pattern for announcements ever since.\n\n​\n\nGotland (Princess Leonore)\n\nGotland itself is Sweden's largest island, although the Province includes the islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands to the west. It occupies a strategic location in the Baltic Sea. Main sources of income include agriculture along with food processing, tourism, information technology services, design, and some heavy industry such as concrete production from locally mined limestone.\n\nMaybe because of its strategic position, the island shows that it has been occupied since prehistory with evidence of 5,000-year-old skeletal remains from Middle Neolithic times. It is also the home of many Viking finds, including the world's largest Viking silver treasure found in 1999.\n\nEarly in the Middle Ages, Gotland became a commercial centre, with the town of Visby the most important Hanseatic city in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Arms have been known from the 13th century in the shape of the seal of the Gutnish Republic with the proud ram and are blasonned as follows:\n\nAzure a ram statant Argent armed Or holding on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third.\n\nAgain, they were granted in 1560 for Gustaf Vasa's funeral.\n\n​The Flags of the World website has this to say about the Arms (www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/se_gotla.html)\n\nAt the time, Gotland was occupied by the Danish, a fact the Swedes had a hard time accepting. Thus arms were created for the island, signalling Sweden's claim to it. These arms were on red, a silver ram carrying a blue and yellow cross flag - the flag of Sweden. In 1570 Sweden ceded the island to Denmark, and the arms were no longer used. However, Sweden regained the island in 1658. At this time the island's arms were on blue an Agnus Dei carrying a silver banner with a red cross. It is possible that the old seal of Gotland (with the ram) was mixed up with the seal of the city of Visby. Visby's seal originally had an Agnus Dei combined with a tree of lilies (known from the 1340s). As a Hanse city, Visby had a German and also a Gotlandic population. In the 1340s the two communities were united. This was reflected in the seal: The lamb represented the Gotlanders, while the tree of lilies represented the Germans. Later, the tree of lilies disappeared, leaving only the lamb and banner. In 1945, Visby officially got arms with an Agnus Dei in red.\n\nPrincess Leonore was born on 20th February 2014 and her full name of Leonore Lilian Maria and ducal title were revealed when her grandfather, King Carl XVI Gustaf, met with the Cabinet on 26th.\n\n​\n\nÅngermanland (Prince Nicolas)\n\nÅngermanland is a historical province in the northern part of Sweden. The name is derived from the Old Norse anger, which means \"deep fjord\" and is a reference to the deep mouth of the Ångerman River (Ångermanälven).\n\nThe landscape is varied, with valleys, rocks, and bogs and there is arable farming in the areas adjoining the rivers – the Ångerman River in particular. The coast line, called the Höga Kusten, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The land still rises at the rate of about one centimetre per year, as an effect of the last ice age that ended in the 7th millennium BC.\n\nThe Coat of Arms represents the rivers being spawning grounds for salmon, i.e. two fish to the sea for each one up the river. There are many similar designs which represent salmon fishing and processing. The blason is as follows:\n\nAzure three Salmons naiant Argent finned Gules, the middle one counternaiant.\n\nStrangely, the Province's symbolic fish is the cod...!\n\n​​Prince Nicolas was born on 15th June 2015 and his names - Nicolas Paul Gustaf - and title were announced at a State Council by his grandfather, The King, two days later. This is the first time that Ångermanland has been used a Duchy.\n\n​\n\nBlekinge (Princess Adrienne)\n\nBlekinge is situated in the south of Sweden and is the country's second-smallest Province, often being called Sweden's garden due to its warm climate. The name comes from the adjective bleke, which corresponds to the nautical term for \"dead calm\".\n\nThe Province is particularly noted for its oak forests, hence the principle element of its Arms - an oak tree. The three Crowns around the trunk symbolize the change in status of the former Danish province, now belonging to Sweden, following many disputes and wars. The blason is as follows:\n\nAzure, an Oak Tree eradicated Or ensigned with three Crowns palewise of the same.\n\n'Eradicated' means that the tree's roots are left showing, rather than being cut off which would have been 'couped'.\n\n​Princess Adrienne was born on 9th March 2018. Her full names - Adrienne Josephine Alice - and title were announced at a State Council by her grandfather, The King, three days later. As with her brother Nicolas, this is the first time that the Province of Blekinge has been used for a ducal title.\n\nI am indebted to David Studham for sharing the following photographs with me for a gallery of Stall Plates of Royal Knights of the Order of the Seraphim.
