        "text": "The report Trevor Roper compiled, published as ‘The Last Days of Adolf Hitler’ remains required reading and an essential starting point for anyone intrigued by the circumstances regarding the Nazi leader’s demise. Most remarkable for the factual reassessments presented as forewords, annexes, and appendices, as Trevor Roper worked on no fewer than six editions – in his own words: “according to the opportunities of knowledge, and the resources of vocabulary”.\n\nPart detective mystery, part political exorcism – Trevor Roper, operating under the alias of “Major Oughton”, was led to confront not only the open case of Hitler’s fate but also the consequences of Soviet control in Berlin, specifically the site of the Führerbunker, and the stony faced response received from Soviet authorities whenever enquiries were made.\n\nNot only at this time did the Soviets forces:\n\npossess a formal statement of Hitler’s death (following an attempt by Wehrmacht General Hans Krebs to arrange a temporary local surrender with the Red Army on April 30th, thirteen hours after Hitler’s suicide)\n\nBut had taken complete control of the crime scene two days later, undertaking an investigation led by SMERSH counter-intelligence officers to retrieve what were believed to be the remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun\n\nAnd even captured – and identified – key members of Hitler’s entourage by May 4th, who could provide eyewitness testimony to the Nazi leaders fate.\n\nThese facts appeared concealed from the British agent in a thick ideological fog.\n\nAlthough, before Trevor Roper’s arrival in the city, the Soviet authorities had announced that Hitler was indeed dead. They would subsequently renege. Before admitting that the corpses of Hitler and wife Eva had indeed been identified. Shortly followed by accusations that Eva Hitler was hiding in the British sector of occupied Germany.\n\nWhy then were the Soviets so intent on obfuscating the matter? Placing an Iron Curtain around any attempt to ascertain the truth.\n\nTrevor Roper would conclude that alongside Cold War tensions, this approach may have had more to do with the Soviet modus operandi than the facts on the ground, stating:\n\n“Previous tyrannies of the spirit have sought to crush defeated but dangerous philosophies by emphatic, public executions: the gibbet, the block, the bloody quarters exhibited in terrorem populi. But such spectacular liquidations, however effective at the time, have a habit of breeding later myths: there are relics of the dead, pilgrimages to the place of execution. The Russian Bolsheviks have therefore preferred in general a less emphatic method: their ideological enemies have slid into oblivion in nameless graves at uncertain dates and no relics of them are available for later veneration.”\n\nPerhaps then it was a matter of keeping Hitler immune from discovery. And his legacy shrouded in confounding mystery.\n\nIn June 1945 – before the start of Trevor Roper’s assignment – Soviet Marshal Zhukov and Colonel-General Berzarin, had made public statements to the press on the last days in Hitler’s chancellery, with both doing little to address speculation of his death. Nothing of the Soviet investigations was mentioned, with both even going as far as speculating Hitler had fled – and was possibly hiding out in Spain.\n\nTrevor Roper would point to this event as being cataclysmic in the dilemma of comprehending Hitler’s fate: “Total silence enveloped the ostentatiously unresolved mystery, and this apparent repudiation of past admissions led, more than any other cause, to the growing belief that Hitler was alive after all.”\n\nPerhaps this was simply a choreographed theatrical display, the construction of which can be traced all the way back to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. An attempt to throw a veil of silence over the issue at best and use it to spread distrust and suspicion among the victorious allies at worst.\n\nIn 1945, Spain was still ruled by Caudillo Frascisco Franco, who despite espousing neutrality during the Second World War, would remain aligned to the Axis powers. And considered by the Soviets, post-WWII as a belligerent nation assisted by the West and the United States.\n\nIn the words of Hugh Trevor Roper, it is possible, however, that the Soviet approach to the issue of Hitler’s fate – that he remained alive – was simply a matter of Stalinist orthodoxy, and the adequate response from the bureaucratic machinery of the dogmatic Soviet system.\n\nThe infallible Stalin had declared the truth, before which inconvenient evidence must bow and retire.\n\nRegardless, the conclusion to the British counter intelligence officer’s report was eventually clear, and as final as it could possibly be, when presented on November 1st 1945.\n\nHitler had died by his own hand.\n\nA stage managed end with a single bullet to the head from a Walther 7.65.\n\nHis body burnt, lest it should be identified and insulted, in a rudimentary funeral pyre of dirt and kerosene.\n\nTrevor Roper would in a later revision – with the benefit of further information – write of the remains being discovered by the Soviet forces and identified by dental staff familiar with the intricacies of Hitler’s mouth. The bodies of both Adolf and wife Eva transported away to be stored in obscurity.\n\nIt would take until the 1968 for the Soviets to finally divulge that they had in-fact carried out detailed investigations in 1945 and 1946 – when they finally did pull back the Iron Curtain erected around the issue, they would focus on one important point of contention with Trevor Roper’s findings.\n\nWhile the British historian turned Intelligence Officer would conclude – specifically following interviews with Hitler’s chauffeur, Erich Kempka, and Hitler Youth leader, Artur Axmann – that Hitler’s death was the result of a self inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe Soviets would propose something to the contrary – death by poison pill.\n\nAn act of cowardice.\n\nRegardless of the deviations between these commonly held Western and Soviet perspectives, we can sufficiently refer to this sequence of events as the ‘official’ story. The facts and evidence to support this composed of an intricate web of eyewitness testimony, meticulous documentation – and forensic evidence – although we will get to that later.\n\nFirst, let’s closer examine the timeline and minutiae of the case for suicide.\n\n–\n\nApril 28th: According to Hitler’s bodyguard, SS Colonel Otto Günsche, after Hitler heard of Himmler’s betrayal his liaison officer, Hermann Fegelein, was immediately suspected of complicity in the plot. Arrested and subject to court martial, he was shot on the night of April 28th/29th. Despite Fegelein being married to Eva Braun’s sister, Hitler did not object or intervene to issue a pardon. Rochus Misch, telephone operator in the Führerbunker, would later describe how: “A Reichssicherheitsdienst colleague shot Fegelein from behind with a machine pistol in the cellar corridor”.\n\nApril 28th – Midnight: Gertrude Junge, Hitler’s secretary, would describe the atmosphere in the bunker at the end of April as having taken on “an aimless, dreamlike quality”. Noting that Hitler had finished dictating his personal and political testament within the first hour of April 29th.\n\nApril 29th – 1am: Hitler marries his long term companion, Eva Braun in a ceremony that lasts only ten minutes, and is carried out in the presence of Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Head of the Nazi Party Chancellery Bormann. There are no female witnesses. Hitler then returns to impatiently oversee Junge transcribing her shorthand notes of his personal and political wills that he dictated at the end of the night before.\n\nDescribing his grim intentions for married life, Hitler would announce: “I myself and my wife – in order to escape the disgrace of deposition or capitulation – choose death. It is our wish to be burnt immediately on the spot where I have carried out the greatest part of my daily work in the course of twelve years’ service to my people.”\n\nAccording to Junge she was then asked by Hitler to take note of his final political testament. In it he decries that he never intended to be faced with war in 1939, blaming Jewish interests for the subsequent carnage. Closing the first part of his political testament, Hitler again outlined his intention to end his life, saying: “I have therefore decided to stay in Berlin and there to choose death voluntarily when I determine that the position of the Führer and the Chancellery itself can no longer be maintained.”\n\nApril 29th – 4am: Hitler’s political testament is signed by four witnesses – Goebbels, Bormann, and Generals Burgdorf and Krebs – and distributed to three messengers. One copy to be sent to Admiral Dönitz (now designated acting Reichspresident), one to Marshal Schörner, head of Army Group Centre, and the other to the headquarters of the Nazi party in Munich.\n\nApril 29th – 5am: Hitler retires to his quarters with his new wife, as Traudl Junge is left to finish typing Joseph Goebbels’ testament. Goebbels’ and his wife Magda will conspire to murder their six children before committing suicide on May 1st. Junge would later say of the children: “they knew nothing of the fate awaiting them, and the adults did all they could to keep them unaware of it.”\n\nApril 29th – 10am: A Hitler Youth runner appears at the upper bunker of the New Reich Chancellery to report that Soviet tanks are now only 500m from the building. Thirty minutes later, the air balloon supporting radio-telephone communications between the bunker and army headquarters is shot down. All telephone communication between the bunker and the outside world have ended.\n\nApril 29th – 11am: Hitler’s valet, Heinz Linge, knocks on the door of his bedroom – for the previous six years it had been Linge’s job to time Hitler as he got dressed, but this time he is sitting on the bed fully dressed, except his tie. Hitler’s barber, August Wollenhaupt, then appears to attend to his hair and moustache, and Hitler receives cocaine eye drops, administered to his right eye by Linge, and takes a packet of anti-gas pastilles to suck on during the day (made of strychnine and atropine).\n\nApril 29th – 2pm: Hitler takes a meal with Eva Braun and a group of secretaries. Since the start of the battle of Stalingrad, the Nazi leader has always prefered female company during his meals. Easier to avoid difficult issues entering into the conversation. Traudl Junge notes that this time Hitler chooses to matter-of-factly explain the ‘best method of suicide’ – to shoot yourself. To which Eva reacts by explaining that she prefers cyanide, saying: “I want to be a beautiful corpse.”\n\nApril 29th – 3pm: One of the Reich Chancellery doctors, Werner Haase, is tasked with testing the cyanide on Hitler’s dog, Blondi, by crushing a capsule inside the dog’s mouth with a pair of pliers. To which Blondi falls sideways “as if struck by lightning”. Telephone operator Rochus Misch would note the smell of bitter almonds and have to rush from his position to the cellar of the new Reich Chancellery to escape it.\n\nApril 29th – 10pm: Hitler receives the news of Mussolini’s death from a transcript of a radio broadcast reportedly accidently picked up by an orderly who was trying to tune a shortwave radio. His valet, Heinz Linge notes that Hitler reads the text and underlines three words referencing Mussolini’s condition: ‘hanging upside down’\n\nApril 30th – 2am: Hitler, having summoned guards and servants for a final farewell, greets SS doctor Professor Ernst Schenck, who remarks on the Führer’s distant stare: “(his eyes are) like wet pale blue porcelain, glazed actually more grey than blue… filmy like the soft skin of a soft rice grape.” Leaving the meeting, Schenck encounters Frau Hitler with a party of drinkers, sitting at the table “like a Rhineland carnival queen.”\n\nApril 30th – 4:30am: Hitler retires to bed\n\nApril 30th – 6:30am: Valet, Heinz Linge, discovers Hitler awake, already fully dressed and lying on his bed.\n\nApril 30th – 7am: Eva Hitler decides to visit the garden above the Führerbunker to see the sun once more. As the sky is darkened with smoke from the nearby battle to take the Reichstag, she only remains briefly before returning to her quarters. Thirty minutes later, Hitler follows Eva’s example and ascends the steps of the bunker towards the Chancellery garden. As he approaches the door, shelling begins outside, and he instead turns around and returns to his quarters.\n\nApril 30th – 12:30pm: Eva Hitler is in her room choosing her final outfit, as Hitler summons Reichsleiter Bormann to come to his study, where he explains that he will take his life with ‘Fraulein Braun’ (Hitler would never refer to her as Frau Hitler) and has instructed his bodyguard Günsche to cremate the bodies. Bormann had earlier made every attempt to persuade Hitler to escape to Obersalzberg, but in vain.\n\nApril 30th – 12:45pm: Hitler summons Günsche and tells him that the time has come and that his chauffeur, Erich Kempka, should bring the petrol to burn the bodies immediately.\n\nApril 30th – 1pm: Hitler eats his final meal – prepared by his personal chef, Constanze Manziarly. A dish of spaghetti with a cabbage and raisin salad.\n\nApril 30th – 1:30pm: Switchboard operator Rochus Misch gets up to stretch his legs by visiting the New Reich Chancellery and encounters three men in uniform. Two high ranking SS officers and a third – Gestapo chief, Heinrich Müller.\n\nApril 30th – 2:45pm: The staff members are gathered in the Führerbunker corridor to say goodbye to Adolf and Eva. Among them, Martin Bormann, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, and Hitler’s secretaries. Traudl Junge would later comment that upon shaking Hitler’s right hand she realised he was looking right through her.\n\nApril 30th – 3:30pm: Otto Günsche stands guard outside Hitler’s office, as the Nazi leader commits suicide alongside Eva. Also waiting outside are Goebbels, Bormann, and some other staff. Traudl Junge is in the upper bunker corridor when she hears the sound of a gunshot, to which Helmuth Goebbels’ loudly exclaims: “Bullseye!”.\n\n“Bormann went in first. Then I followed the valet Linge. Hitler was sitting in a chair. Eva was lying on the couch. She had taken off her shoes and placed them neatly together at one end of the couch. Hitler’s face was covered in blood. There were two guns. One was a Walther PPK. It was Hitler’s. The other was a smaller pistol he always carried in his pocket. Eva wore a blue dress with white collar and cuffs. Her eyes were wide open. There was a stench of cyanide. The smell was so strong that I thought my clothes would smell for days – but this may have been my imagination.” SS Colonel Otto Günsche, Hitler’s bodyguard\n\nThree SS guards and valet Heinz Linge then carry Hitler’s body to the Chancellery garden, as Martin Bormann lifts the body of Eva Hitler, covered in a blanket out into the corridor where Erich Kempka carries her to the stairs before Günsche takes over. Chauffeur Kempka then arrives with petrol, the bodies are placed in a shallow depression outside the bunker, near an abandoned cement mixer. Joseph Goebbels’ produces a box of matches, whereup Linge lights some paper to create a torch and sets fire to the bodies. As the funeral party returns to the safety of the staircase, a final Heil Hitler is shouted, arms raised, before they descend again into the underground purgatory of the bunker.\n\n“(Even after the bodies were burned), we were imprisoned by the very presence of Hitler again. We could not get away from it (the smell). It smelled like burning bacon.” Erich Kempka, Hitler’s chauffeur.\n\nApril 30th – 4:15pm: Otto Günsche sits down next to Traudl Junge, grabs a bottle of schnapps from her hand and says: “I have carried out the Führer’s last order. His body has been burned.” Heinz Linge, Hitler’s valet, orders the blood stained rug in Hitler’s quarters to be taken to the surface and burned.\n\nApril 30th – 6:30pm: Two Waffen SS officers (Ewald Lindloff and Hans Reisser) manage to partially cover up the shallow bomb crater full of remains with dirt. It has been more than 2 hours since the bodies were brought to the surface, and the SS men have had to return to the remains with more petrol at least once to reignite the fire and complete the job. Subsequent interrogations would suggest around 200 litres of petrol was used.\n\nMay 1st – Evening: Joseph and Magda Goebbels arrange the deaths of their six children in the bunker before committing suicide.\n\nMay 2nd – 08:23am: General Helmuth Weidling, commander of the Berlin Defence Area, is taken to see Red Army General Vasily Chuikov and orders that the city’s remaining defenders should surrender.\n\nMay 4th 1945: Hitler’s remains are discovered by Red Army troops in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery\n\n–\n\nIf we are to attribute any veracity to the claims made by each of these characters, the conditions of their treatment must be considered.\n\nDespite systematic torture of this group in the Soviet dungeons of the Lubyanka and Butyrka at the hands of NKVD interrogators – and the prying ears of cell informants charged with milking every last detail from the group – nothing of Hitler’s plan to escape to Argentina was mentioned. Nor had the initial – more innocent – investigations of SMERSH in May/June 1945 unearth a smoking gun.\n\nCertainly of the main trio targeted by the Soviets – Günsche, Baur, and Linge – the latter two, with their lack of military training or preparation for interrogation, would surely have broken under the strain and spilled anything and everything. Yet, despite the pressure, even in their wildest stages of submission, they did not have the wherewithal to propose anything so drastic to alleviate their suffering.\n\nTo all intents and purposes, it would appear from the collated eyewitness Führerbunker accounts that Hitler had perished at his own hand. The disagreement would be in the details. Was it by bullet or by poison? And at what hour?\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, an investigative team composed of French journalist, Jean-Christoph Brisard, and Russian translator and filmmaker, Lana Parshina, were granted access to both the archives of the Russian state (GARF) and the Russian FSB intelligence service archives. In the process, offered the rare opportunity to consult the interrogation reports gathered by SMERSH and the NKVD of Hitler’s entourage – but more importantly the human remains considered to be those of Adolf Hitler.\n\nBrisard and Parshina would also be accompanied by French forensic examiner and archaeo-anthropologist Phillippe Charlier – the so-called “Indiana Jones of the graveyards”, previously responsible for pronouncing on the remains of Richard the Lionheart, Joan of Arc, and Tribune of the French revolution, Robespierre.\n\nThis unprecedented access to both the fragment of skull stored in the GARF archive and the rows of teeth kept by the FSB would present some interesting conclusions.\n\nIn 2009, Connecticut archeologist, Nick Bellantoni had been granted access to the skull section (the rear left side) and determined that it was from someone aged between twenty and forty, and thus could not be Hitler’s. Phillippe Charlier would find fault with his American colleague’s verdict.\n\nBellantoni’s basis for his conclusion was a rudimentary examination of the structure of the bones – claiming the skull too fine and too fragile to correspond to that of an adult male. Additionally, the sutures that hold the plates of the skull together were said to be too closed – contrary to those of someone Hitler’s age who would have been wide open.\n\nCharlier instead would state: “On a skeleton, the diagnosis of sex is performed only on the pelvis. It’s unthinkable with a skull, a mandible, or a femur. And you would need to have the whole skull. Which is not really the case here.”\n\nSpeaking about the sutures: “I wouldn’t risk giving an age to a bone like this based only on the gap in the sutures. They vary so much between one individual and another. It’s possible that my sutures are completely closed like those of an old person, while my grandmother’s were open when she died. I insist you can’t give the age of this skull on the basis of the sutures.”\n\nOn further examination, Charlier would find that the skull section shows signs of being buried – at least briefly – and that it bears marks that can only be ascribed to carbonisation from burning.\n\nThe skull also displays an exit wound from a gunshot – around 6mm wide. A bullet fired – Charlier concludes – at “cool, damp bone” – which would indicate impact either when Hitler was alive or shortly after his death.\n\nIn the GARF collection, the team were also allowed to examine a piece of sofa – said to have come from Hitler’s bunker – and discovered blood traces that corresponded to photos taken in 1946. “All of these traces can also be found identically in the photographs from 1946,” Charlier would say. “It would demonstrate astonishing counterfeiting skill if it was a copy.”\n\nBlood tests carried out by the Soviets could only conclude that the blood type on the sofa matched Hitler’s – Type A (the type given in testimony from Hitler’s personal doctor, Dr Morell).\n\nAn interesting detail unearthed in the detective work of the team would provide insight into how the competing branches of the Soviet state dealt with the Hitler question in 1945 and 1946. The first investigation carried out by SMERSH counter-intelligence officers, followed by a further fact-finding mission in 1946 from the Ministry of the Internal Affairs (MVD) – codenamed ‘Operation Myth’.\n\nBrisard and Parshina would have access to a wealth of Soviet era documents detailing how the initial investigation in 1945 gathered the bodies of Adolf and Eva, Joseph and Magda Goebbels (and their children), and General Krebs, the head of the German Army General Staff.\n\nThe section of the skull preserved in the GARF archives would only be discovered one year later in May 1946, as the second team – organised by the Ministry of Internal Affairs – was sent to conclusively confirm Hitler’s death, discovering remains the first team had overlooked in the process.\n\nThe bodies discovered by the SMERSH team were subsequently destroyed in the 1970s – following orders from future Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, then President of the Committee of State Security in the Council of Ministers of the USSR. This operation – codenamed Archive – would see the remains gathered from a plot in Magdeburg, in the military town on Westendstrasse, near house number 36 (now Klausenerstrasse), where they had been temporarily buried.\n\nOn April 5th 1970, a Top Secret document would record their destruction – stating the bodies were incinerated “by means of their combustion on a pyre on waste ground near the town of Schönebeck, eleven kilometres from Magdeburg. The remains were burnt, crushed to ashes with coal, collected and thrown into the River Biderin, which is confirmed by the present act. Signed Head of the Special KGB Unit u.m No. 92626.”\n\nOne part of Hitler’s body did avoid destruction, to be stored in the FSB (formerly KGB) archives. The team would also have access to the preserved sections of Hitler’s teeth to analyze.\n\nTeeth that the Soviets had originally used to positively identify Hitler based on statements from his dentist’s assistant, Kathe Heusermann.\n\nIt was photos of these teeth – compared with three X Rays of Hitler’s skull taken in 1944 – that two Norwegian dentists had used to conclude, in 1972, that the material held by the Soviets matched. Working only from documents, Reidar Sognnaes (Dean of Harvard School of Dental Medicine) and Ferdinand Ström (a pioneer in forensic odontology), would contribute the first non-Soviet scientific report to lend credence to the theory of Hitler’s death.\n\nThis would, of course, do little to put an end to the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt would be mid-afternoon inside office number 344, third floor of the FSB’s Lubyanka archive in Moscow on July 12th 2017, that Jean-Christoph Brisard and Lana Parshina – along with forensic examiner Phillippe Charlier – would finally be granted access to consult the remnants of Hitler’s teeth.\n\nArmed with a state of the art binocular microscope, Charlier reached the cold scientific conclusion of his study:\n\nthe teeth are authentic, not reproductions, time specific to the era, and definitively can be said to have belonged to Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler.\n\nOne final question remained to be resolved. Charlier consulted the teeth further to find traces of gunpowder, antimony, lead, or barium – the presence of which would indicate a gunshot through the mouth. While damage that could be attributed to fire was visible, Charlier noted something more curious – blue residue on some of Hitler’s original teeth.\n\nGranted an even rarer look at three teeth attributed to Eva Braun – although impossible to identify when lacking dental records – the team found the same coloured traces. The shade of this blue, ironically, is known as Prussian Blue – named after a German chemist in Berlin in the early eighteenth century who discovered it. The indication itself is enough: Dark Blue – kuanos in Ancient Greek – is where the substance in question gets its name: Cyanide.\n\nThe most likely version of events involves both a bullet and a capsule of cyanide. The capsule is broken open by biting, then the contents are swallowed, as potassium cyanide isn’t deadly on its own – it has to react with stomach acids to become hydrogen cyanide. Thus allowing enough time for a personal coup de grâce. In Hitler’s case, a self inflicted shot from a pistol.\n\nIf the story were to end there, it would be remarkable enough already. Yet, when returning to Paris after the Moscow trip in 2017, Phillippe Charlier would find tiny pieces of tartar from Hitler’s teeth that had broken away during the examination and travelled westward with the latex gloves used during the investigation.\n\nAnalysis of these small fragments would find traces of vegetable fibre – but no meat (Hitler had been a vegetarian for several years before his death). More importantly a deeper analysis would find a lack of antimony, lead, and barium – Hitler had not shot himself in the mouth.\n\nModern forensics had concluded that which could not be laid conclusively to rest 75 years ago.\n\n–"
