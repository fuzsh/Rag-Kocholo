        "text": "About the cemetery\n\nThe Municipal Cemetery of Monturque, also known as San Rafael Cemetery, is situated between the Parish of San Mateo and the Local Historical Museum, on the highest point of the hill where the town is located.\n\nIt is the only cemetery in Spain that houses an archaeological site within its grounds, offering access to Roman Cisterns partially located beneath its subsoil.\n\nThe cemetery was closed at the beginning of 2007 due to lack of space, as it was impossible to create new niches without risking damage to the Roman Cisterns. Consequently, a new cemetery, San José Cemetery, was built on the outskirts of the town in the area known as \"El Cañuelo,\" next to the A-45 Córdoba-Málaga highway.\n\nAbout the cemetery\n\nPlanning for Strandkyrkogården began in the first years of the 1980s and the facility was inaugurated on 20 September 1996. No chapel buildings were erected because Strandkyrkogården was considered complementary to Skogskyrkogården in Gamla Enskede.\n\nThe cemetery covers 25 hectares of land that alternates between open parkland and closed forest areas with the burial sites. In total, there is room for around 20.000 graves. The entrance is located by Gudöbroleden and is decorated with granite blocks from Göinge. Next to the cemetery 's memorial grove , there is a viewpoint with a view of lake Drevviken.\n\nText and photo source: www.wikipedia.org\n\nThe Western Cemetery\n\nThe Western Cemetery is a landscaped garden inaugurated in 1873.\n\nIt was the first neutral cemetery in Ghent that offered a resting place to all convictions with a complete freedom of choice of the personal tombstone. This results in a big individual diversity integrated in one garden.\n\nEspecially in the romantic 19th century people visited this cemetery for a Sunday-stroll and enjoyed the splendour of the monuments and the tranquillity of nature.\n\nMore about the cemetery: www.visit.gent.be/campo-santo\n\nThe Campo Santo of Sint-Amandsberg\n\nThe Campo Santo of Sint-Amandsberg is a 19th century cemetery located on a hill, which is special because of the lowland landscape.\n\nThis cemetery dates from 1847 and is a very important burial place for Flemish writers, artists and local nobility.\n\nIt was inspired by Père Lachaise, the largest cemetery in Paris, and now has more than 131 protected tombs.\n\nMore about the cemetery: www.visit.gent.be/western-cemetery\n\nAbout the cemetery\n\nThe decision made by the French authorities during the Napoleonic occupation of Spanish territory would bring to fruition the Cemetery of Our Lady of Health, which, since its construction in 1811, expanded until reaching its final form in 1833.\n\nThe final configuration of this cemetery took place in 1846 with the incorporation of the Chapel of Our Lady of Health, which would form the façade we know today and give it a harmonious appearance. This façade, which is an interesting example of neoclassical architecture, consists of two parts of adjacent columns that support a triangular pediment. This pediment frames a niche with the Madonna and Child and the words \"Salus Infirmorum\" (\"Health of the Sick\").\n\nAfter various vicissitudes caused by the political shifts during the reign of Ferdinand VII, it was established as one of the most stable and permanent cemeteries in the city since 1833. It was from this year onwards that burials began in the cemetery.\n\nAmong other important tombs, the cemetery includes the graves of Manuel Rodríguez Sánchez \"Manolete\", Rafael Guerra Bejarano \"Guerrita\", Rafael Molina Sánchez Lizard, and Rafael González \"Machaquito\". It also houses the family mausoleum of the Counts of Casillas de Velasco, the Marquis of Conde de Salazar, the Cabriñana family, etc.\n\nIn Córdoba, there are three other cemeteries. The Cemetery of San Rafael (1835) contains the graves of Julio Romero de Torres and Manuel Calero Cantero \"Calerito.\""
