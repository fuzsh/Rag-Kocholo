Recently, a critical situation has been drawn attention upon skipjack resources. Skipjack fishing along the coastal areas of Kochi has been experiencing severely poor catches. The causes are considered to be climate change and overfishing. To address the issues, in 2017, volunteers in Kochi Prefecture launched the Kochi Sustainable Skipjack Association (KSSA) to preserve skipjack resources and food culture. Currently, over 140 members are working towards establishing sustainable skipjack fisheries by following the vigorous activities such as (1) active information sharing and outreaching; (2) raising public awareness of the fishing industry and consumption manner; (3) conducting survey of resources and carrying conservation activities; and (4) preservation and sharing of food cultures.
