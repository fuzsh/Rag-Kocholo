The film was produced as part of the “Sustainable Recovery Project,” a collaboration between the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the film festival, and featured Tsurutaro Kataoka, Koh Maehara, Juki Iwamoto, Matthew Chozik, and director Shoji Yasui. Mr. Kataoka, who played the role of a craftsman of Edo kiriko, a traditional handicraft of Tokyo, which is the core of the story, said, “I hope this film will make many people aware of Edo kiriko, and encourage them to use it for Japanese whiskey and other beverages. The filming lasted only one day, but we borrowed an actual craftsman’s studio for the shoot, so I was able to get into craftsman mode.” He recounted a story of filming in a short period of time. Mr. Maehara, who played the role of Mr. Kataoka’s son, commented with a smile, “I thought I didn’t look like my father as I filmed.

The film was directed by Daisuke Kamijo, the director of “We Are Strangers.” When asked why he chose “tenement houses” as the theme of the film, Kamijo replied, “I chose this theme because I was attracted to the world of tenement houses, where people are connected to each other in an environment where they cannot meet the people they want to meet because of COVID.” Ikeda, who played the role of the cheerful and good-natured Rika, said, “I played the role while loving Rika’s brightness, kindness, and strength. When I was creating the role, Rika’s personality and thoughts were strangely easy to understand, and I think that Rika’s atmosphere had something in common with my own. The scene where she is drinking Hoppy drinks with everyone at the tenement is very nice, so I hope you will watch it. Ms. Nagata, who played the role of the egocentric and cool Hibiki, the opposite of Rika, said, “I had never played a character with such an indifferent personality, so it was refreshing. Playing the role made me feel that I could live freely without trying too hard.” “The Theory of Relativity and Row Houses” is a film that fits the theme of “Hoppy Happy,” which is a combination of “tenement,” “human connections,” and “hoppy,” and is scheduled to be shown on “Hoppy Happy Theater,” an online theater specializing in short films.\n\nAfter the cast members took the stage, the 4th HOPPY HAPPY AWARD was announced. Kenji Qurata’s “Ten Days and Eternity” won the award.\n\n■George Lucas Award (Grand Prix) announced and presented\n\nThe winners of the Live Action (International, Asia International, Japan), Non-Fiction, and Animation categories, as well as the official jury members, LiLiCo and Bessho, took the stage.
