        "text": "Never discourage anyone who continually makes progress, no matter how slow.\n\n– Plato\n\nIn this article your humble servant would like to introduce a Japanese version of a most mundane tool, one especially useful to the woodworker: the Little Turtle scrub brush.\n\nYour slovenly servant is not a neat freak, nor do I have a cleaning fetish, much as my long-suffering mother tried to stop me eating leftover dog food off the floor as a toddler. But there is one area of human endeavor where maintaining cleanliness in an otherwise dirty world is important to me, namely sharpening woodworking tools.\n\nThis is the story of a lowly brush, not a tool we typically sell at C&S Tools, but one we often provide as a service to Beloved Customers who purchase sharpening products from us. I don’t believe it can be purchased outside Japan, but the purpose of this article is to help Beloved Customer better understand an indispensible accoutrement for sharpening your woodworking tools. So with your kind indulgence I’ll try to present this subject in a sanitary manner.\n\nWhy a Scrub Brush?\n\nAs described in our previously published series about sharpening, a basic, effective set of stones for sharpening chisels and plane blades should include a rough stone or diamond stone of 400~800 grit, a medium stone 1000~2000 grit, and a finish stone 6,000~8,000 grit. The list can be found at this link.\n\nA nagura stone is also extremely useful IMO for cleaning and flattening sharpening stones and reducing the time required to get them operating effectively.\n\nAs mentioned above, these stones are almost always used in series, with the nagura dressing them all.\n\nA couple of extremely common problems we face when sharpening is dust and other hard particles, many of which are airborne, contaminating our precious stones and reducing their effective grit. For instance, an 8,000 grit stone contaminated with a bit of silica-based dust will be unable to produce scratches finer than, let’s say, a 1,000 grit stone, resulting in poor results, wasted time, money and steel, and dashed expectations. I’ve written on this subject elsewhere. Link\n\nThere are few tools mankind uses that are routinely made as sharp or sharpened as often as high-quality woodworking tools, a process that, when done efficiently requires 2-4 sharpening stones to accomplish, usually used in series. And high-quality sharpening stones, be they synthetic or natural, are pricey, so the wise woodworker who needs excellent results will seek maximum performance at minimum cost and time expenditure.\n\nHow do we prevent nature from effectively turning our expensive stones to bricks? Four ways.\n\nFirst, when not in use keep stones covered to reduce the dirt and dust that falls on them. Wrapping them in a clean rags or clean, ordinary newspaper works fine. I like newspaper best.\n\nSecond, before using a stone and/or nagura, scrub its faces, sides and ends with a clean bristle brush and rinse to remove contaminating grit.\n\nThird, before using your fine-grit stones, especially if there is any doubt about their being free of embedded contaminants, work their faces with a nagura stone to dig out contaminants, then rinse off the mud produced along with any contaminants thus exorcised with clean water.\n\nFourth, before sharpening, use a brush and clean water to remove dust and grit from the tools that will spend time frolicking on the stones.\n\nAnd finally, during sharpening use a dedicated source of absolutely clean, chlorine-free water to wash tools and stones and to re-wet them. What’s wrong with tap water? Depends. I use distilled water to eliminate chlorine with a bit of borax powder added to adjust the PH to reduce the potential for corrosion. In my workshop I store this water in a plastic laboratory wash bottle with a bent tube. In the field I carry a smaller volume in a plastic mustard or ketchup bottle. Whatever floats your boat, as the saying goes.\n\nSo exactly why do I say you need a scrub brush in your sharpening kit? Because if they do their job, the bristles of a quality brush are more effective at digging dirt and contaminating grit out of sharpening stones and the nooks and crannies of plane blades and chisels than any other tool including water faucets, hoses, chemical sprays, micro-fiber cloths or even kitten tongues (シ). Or did you imagine a simple wash in water or a wipe with a wet rag had stripped away all those nasty particles away just because you didn’t notice them anymore? Please restrict your optimism to reasonable limits.\n\nThe Scrub Brush\n\nBut isn’t one scrub brush much the same as any other? Nay, Beloved Customer, nay.\n\nIn the case of sharpening stones, we need to thoroughly clean our stones and tools without transferring contaminating dirt and grit from one stone to the next. I have found that the hard grit of sharpening stones becomes permanently embedded in the plastic and nylon bristles of every such brush I have examined, and even if I thought I had cleaned the brush thoroughly, hard grit particles remained and were transferred to the next stone by the brush.\n\nHow to avoid this? The solution is simply to avoid scrub brushes with nylon or plastic bristles. In my experience natural bristle brushes, and especially the Kamenoko (Little Turtle) brand brushes, simply last much longer than plastic and nylon bristle brushes, are more easily cleaned of sharpening stone grit, and tend to transfer less of it from one sharpening stone to another. These three points are the crux of this article.\n\nJapanese tawashi brushes are made from the fibers of coconut husks. As Beloved Customer is no doubt aware, in his eternal wisdom the design team the Good Lord assigned to coconut palms provided them fibrous husks to protect and float their seeds long distances over wide, soggy oceans for years at a time. To accomplish this Homeric feat, the fibers of these husks are caused to grow tough but resilient and resistant to degradation from long-term exposure to water, microbes and even detergents.\n\nIt’s a traditional product that’s been around a long time in Japan with one company producing them for over 100 years. Here’s a video of tawashi brushes being made in Japan, and another video of production in Sri Lanka.\n\nThese brushes are also good for cleaning dirty, greasy hands, scrubbing pots and pans, cleaning car tires and wheels, and getting mud off boots with very little scratching.\n\nIf they have one downside, it’s that, being made of natural and recyclable fibers, and despite not becoming mushy when wetted for long periods of time and drying quicker than plastic brushes, they still take a bit of time time to dry and can develop mold if neglected. There’s a stainless steel wire binding the fibers together with a loop on one end that can used with a string to hang them for drying. Problem solved.\n\nI’ve been using one Kamenoko Tawashi brush for cleaning tools and sharpening stones for over 20 years. I don’t say they’ll last that many years in the kitchen or garage, but they still last 5 times longer than plastic or nylon brushes and are therefore much more cost effective.\n\nMost importantly, they help me keep my stones cleaner and ensure they sharpen to spec.\n\nYMHOS\n\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about our tools, please click the “Pricelist” link here or at the top of the page and use the “Contact Us” form located immediately below.\n\nPlease share your insights and comments with everyone in the form located further below labeled “Leave a Reply.” We aren’t evil Google, fascist Facebook, or thuggish Twitter and so won’t sell, share, or profitably “misplace” your information.

Thus he passes through life.\n\n– Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nhis is the sixth article in our series about Japanese handplanes. In previous installments we compared Western and Japanese planes and discussed how to tune and adjust the Japanese hiraganna plane. In this article your humble servant will be so bold as to explain how to setup and maintain the sole of the Japanese handplane.\n\nThe sole of a handplane is critical because it positions the blade’s cutting edge in relation to the board being worked making it possible to cut useful shavings of the desired thickness and length. Sometimes we want to cut thick shavings to quickly remove material from a board when flattening and/or dimensioning it, the job of the arashiko plane (荒仕子鉋). Sometimes we want to take ultra-thin shavings to create a flat, smooth, even shiny surface, the job of the finish, or shiage plane (仕上げ鉋). One plane cannot do it all, nor can a single type of sole setup.\n\nIn this article we will consider ways to setup the sole of a Japanese plane for Beloved Customer’s specific purpose. We will also examine ways to maintain the sole and the necessary tools.\n\nSoleful Profiles\n\nBesides keeping the cutting edge properly positioned to take shavings the handplane’s sole has another important role many overlook. We examined this in Part 5 of this series. In summary, to cut efficiently and minimize wasteful tearout on the surface of a board being planed, a contact strip approximately 3-6mm wide located directly in front of the mouth opening must apply uniform pressure on the surface of the board. This important principle is effective in the case of all handplanes of all countries made of all materials be they organic or metallic.\n\nIndeed, depending on one’s skill with a handplane (there’s more than just pushing and pulling involved, after all), so long as this strip on the sole is applying even pressure to the board right up to the mouth opening, the rest of the sole can be pretty wonky and still yield good results with little or no tearout. And while this level of skill comes of experience, it all begins with understanding the aforementioned principle.\n\nBeloved Customer is not doubt aware that the basic, standard sole configuration for handplanes is a simple flat surface free of wind. A little different from the adjustable bed of an electrical jointer, of course. While all handplanes wear and require constant maintenance regardless of their construction, wooden-bodied planes are softer than metal-bodied planes and tend to wear and warp more in use, the price we must pay for the advantages of the wooden body.\n\nThe wise man, therefore, will strive to discover ways to make the necessary task of truing the sole of his planes as easy as possible, a mindset clearly reflected in the Japanese version of the wooden bodied handplane giving it a huge advantage over its Western counterparts, at least in the hands of the thoughtful and diligent craftsman. Sadly, many newbies and all wood butchers poorly understand how the sole of the handplane works, or fail to set it up properly, or fail to maintain it properly blaming the plane when it stops working instead of themselves. So sad. So self-defeating.\n\nWell-made Western planes ideally have a uniformly-flat sole. But is it really necessary to have the entire area of the sole in contact with the surface of the board being planed? Please consider this question in light of my earlier statement about the most important part of the sole being the contact strip directly in front of the mouth.\n\nJapanese craftsmen decided long ago that it’s most efficient to relieve (remove) areas of the sole located between two or three critical contact points on the sole thereby making it much easier and quicker to true the soles of their planes, while at the same time significantly reducing friction, both significant advantages springing from a simple modification. This is much the same principle as the hollow-ground ura in the blades of Japanese planes, chisels and knives. The application of this principle results in two basic profiles to plane soles described below.\n\nWhile lots of graphics would be nice, I beg Beloved Customer’s indulgence with the one I have available.\n\nThe Sole of the Arashiko Plane\n\nThe first and most common profile, illustrated below, is applicable to all planes intended for creating straight, flat surfaces, including the arashiko plane as well as the various types of jointer (nagadai) and shooting (suridai) planes. Finishing planes have a different sole profile described in the next section.\n\nContact area “C” is a strip of the sole located directly in front of the mouth and the full-width of the sole, and is the single most important detail of the sole. Contact area D is also a full-width contact strip located at the leading edge of the sole. And contact area A is located at the trailing edge of the sole. It’s very much a matter of personal preference, but a length of 6-10mm is typical for these contact areas.\n\nThe crosshatched areas in the drawing indicate where the sole has been scraped away leaving it hollow or “swamped.” These areas do not contact the surface of the board being planed. The precise shape of these swamped areas between A and B and C and D is unimportant, but it’s best if they are relatively uniform and approximately 0.2-0.5mm deep. Once again, personal preference.\n\nPlease note that point B, and the portion of the sole immediately behind the blade, is always relieved and does not contact the board being planed. This is important because if this area contacts the board being planed vexing problems often result. Most people get this wrong at least once, or fail to perform proper maintenance allowing this swamped area to bottom-out whereupon the usual undignified weeping, wailing etc. ensues. You’ve been warned.\n\nThis arrangement gives the plane three supporting strips, and because the front and rear contact strips are located at the extreme ends of the plane, the full-length of the plane’s body will act as a jig so the plane will tend to shave off the tops of high spots and skip over low spots producing a straight/flat surface quicker and more precisely than a simple flat, planer (meaning “lying in a single plane”) sole typically will. You will notice the difference if you pay attention.\n\nThis arrangement also makes it very easy to adjust the sole to keep the critical contact strip in front of the mouth in tight contact with the board being planed.\n\nSome people like to add another contact strip, or even two, between C and D. This works well tending to slow down wear on the sole, but it is a fiddly detail most people don’t bother with.\n\nBut as so much in life, not all is not blue bunnies and fairy farts for this arrangement of three or more contact strips tends to lift the cutting edge up and away from the surface being planed when they pass over even tiny irregularities on the board’s surface. This is hunky-dory in most cases, but once the board is as flat as we need it to be, this porpoising movement over every tiny irregularity, especially if the blade is set to take a fine shaving, can become counterproductive to producing a smooth, shiny surface. So how best to setup the sole when we need our plane to do more smoothing and finishing than truing and flattening?\n\nThe Sole of the Finishing Plane\n\nI apologize for not having a pretty illustration, but Beloved Customers are, without exception, highly intelligent and intuitive souls (no pun intended) so I’m confident a simple written description of the difference between the sole of a finishing plane and the one described above will suffice.\n\nThat difference in the soles of these two types of plane is simply that the sole is entirely swamped from the heel of the plane (contact strip A) to the mouth opening. In other words, contact strips C & D remain unchanged but contract strip A is completely shaved away. That simple.\n\nFor example, the overall length of the dai (body) of the finishing plane body cut by Mr. Inomoto I have in my hand as I write this (gotta be careful to not drop it on my inkpot!) is 280mm. If setup as an arashiko or flattening plane, the effective planing distance would be the entire length of the plane’s sole. In this case, however, Mr. Inomoto has it set it up as a finishing plane so he has swamped/relieved the entire sole from the mouth opening to the heel (Point A to Point B), approximately 108mm. The effective length of the sole for purposes of flattening measured from toe to mouth therefore is 173mm, a 38% reduction.\n\nWhy bother with a measly 173mm you ask? Ah, Beloved Customer is especially perspicacious today!\n\nSince the effective jig length of the sole is reduced 38%, and the cutting edge is located at the extreme tail end of that area, the cutting edge will tend to more closely follow irregularities in the board’s surface riding them up and down and in and out instead of bridging and porpoising over them allowing the blade to cut long, uniform shavings without the interruptions that would otherwise result from the sole riding the tops of residual irregularities in the board’s surface lifting the cutting edge up and out of contact with the board when we need it to more closely follow the contours of the board. It’s a genius concept that works well in application.\n\nBut of course that monster Murphy will not permit good things to continue for long, so if this arrangement stops working for you, be sure to check the following three things:\n\nYour blade is sharp;\n\nThe 2 or three contact strips you have provided (more if you like multiple swamps) are truly planar (in the same plane);\n\nAnd most importantly, the contact strip in front of the mouth is flat and in uniform contact with the board being planed. I can’t stress too heavily the importance of this little patch of wood.\n\nHere is Wisdom: When setting-up and maintaining the sole of a Japanese plane always always always give the contact strip in front of the mouth highest priority, while at the same time minimizing any shaving/scraping you do to it.\n\nWhy is your humble servant so irritatingly picky about minimizing shaving/scraping at this contact strip? More of that demon-chewed hard-earned wisdom: While wear is inevitable, any scraping/shaving you do to this contact strip will open up the mouth further reducing the plane’s useful effectiveness at taking fine shavings (think about it). This isn’t so much a problem for an arashiko, truing, or jointer plane but it imposes a significant detriment to the quality of a finish plane’s work. So don’t diddle with the mouth contact strip more than is necessary.\n\nTools and Techniques for Sole Setup and Maintenance\n\nYou’ll need the following tools, at minimum, for initial setup and periodic maintenance of your Japanese hiraganna handplane:\n\nA sharp handplane that can cut a smooth, flat surface. For a 70mm handplane, you really need an 80mm handplane, but with care narrower planes can also do the job. Don’t let it become a chicken and egg problem.\n\nA scraper tool of sorts. I prefer a simple card scraper, an ancient and uniquely Western tool that the Kezuroukai has made popular in Japan recently. You’ll need a burnishing tool of sorts to turn the burr. A wide chisel can also be used as a scraper, although it’s hard on the edge. I was taught to maintain a plane’s sole using the traditional dainaoshi plane, essentially a small scraper plane. These work well enough, but the card scraper works better IMHO.\n\nA straightedge. The classic Japanese tool for this job is the wooden “shitaba awase jougi” 下端合定規. More on it below. A better more modern tool is the hardened, stainless steel, beveled-edged, notched precision straightedge made by Matsui Precision. This tool has the huge advantage of being able to check the sole for straight, flat and wind with the blade installed and its cutting edge projecting through the mouth the appropriate distance.\n\nA piece of minimum 3/8″ (10mm) thick float glass longer than the sole of your plane.\n\nA pencil.\n\nA small square.\n\nProcedures\n\nCheck the Sole: The first step is to use your straightedge to check that the sole is straight, flat and free of wind. Install the blade and chipbreaker with the cutting edge projecting through the mouth just as it will be when the plane is used. This is important because the wedging action of the blade can cause the body to warp slightly. If you don’t have a notched straightedge and don’t want to make one yourself, insert the blade so the cutting edge remains recessed in the mouth without projecting. 0.001″ is probably OK. Check the sole lengthwise, crosswise, and multiple diagonals.\n\nTrue the Sole: When initially setting-up or drastically redoing the sole of a wooden handplane, you must make the sole absolutely flat and free of wind (twist) using your handplane and/or scraper and your precision straightedge. You may need to remove and reinstall the blade and chipbreaker several times to get this right. An alternate, but disgusting, technique is to use sandpaper and the float glass mentioned above supported on a stable, flat surface like the bed of a electric jointer or tablesaw to flatten the sole. Be sure to recess the cutting edge slightly. Don’t remove more wood than is absolutely necessary. Check for flatness and wind frequently.\n\nLayout the Contact Strips: Use your pencil and square to layout the locations of the contact strips. Use your pencil to crosshatch the areas to be swamped.\n\nRelieve the Crosshatched Areas: With the blade and chipbreaker installed, use your scraper, chisel, or dainaoshi plane to scrape away the appropriate amount of wood from the hollow, swamped areas. Be careful to not let your metal tools touch the blade of your plane.\n\nCheck the Sole: With the blade and chipbreaker installed but slightly recessed into the mouth, check how it feels on the supported plate glass. The plane should not rock or roll when you push down on its ends or corners, depending of course on the sole setup you chose and where you push. If it does rock rub a itsy bitsy teeny weeny bit of oil on the glass, place the plane sole-down on it, and move it around a few millimeters. Then check the oil transferred to the sole to determine areas of contact. It may help to add a little graphite from your pencil to the oil to make the contact areas show up better. The most important goal is uniform contact at the strip in front of the mouth.\n\nRefine the Sole: Use your scraper tool to carefully remove material preventing uniform, full-width contact at the mouth. If at all possible, accomplish this by removing material from the other contact strips first. Make only tiny adjustments while sneaking up on the final surface like a tiny, needle-clawed, big-eyed kitten stalking a grasshopper. This is important. During this process recheck the sole with your straightedge and glass plate frequently.\n\nThe Shitaba Awase Jogi 下端合わせ定規\n\nThe shitaba awase jougi is the first tool I was required to make for myself during training in Japan. This was once standard procedure in all woodworking trades.\n\nIt’s simply two sticks of wood, usually cut bookmatch from a single piece of stable, quartersawn soft wood, connected face to face with two dowels or dovetail tenons. If you shoot one edge of this tool with a jointer plane when the two halves are joined, then separate them and hold them up to a light source with their edges butted together, the gap between the two edges will reveal double the error. By rejoining the halves, carefully planing/scraping their edges, and frequently rechecking the gap, one can consistently create two high-precision straightedges that won’t damage your plane blade. The webpage at this link shows how to make one version. It’s a lifetime tool.\n\nWhen using your plane, sure as eggses is eggses the time will come when you will discover it’s stopped working, usually right at the the most inconvenient time for Murphy will have his way. At that juncture weeping, wailing and gnashing of teethses may ensue! When this happens remain calm and consider the experience for what it is: another step on the path to mastery. Then gird up your loins, really tight so the boys start to complain, and simply follow the three steps listed above. All will be well, I promise.\n\nIn the next installment in this series of inklings about stealthy kittens and Murphy’s pointy purple poisonous pecker we will discuss how to use the Japanese handplane, a task many people unwittingly get wrong.

So for the benefit our Beloved Customers, I will explain of some of the solutions learned over the years from senior Japanese craftsmen, and acquired during many decades of brutal study at the University of Stoopid, School of Hard Knocks (Lower Outhouse Campus), which may prove useful.\n\nWhat is the Kiwaganna Handplane?\n\nThe Japanese Kiwaganna is written 際鉋 in Chinese characters, and pronounced kee/wha/gah/nah. “Kiwa” means “edge” or “verge,” and “ganna” means handplane.\n\nWhile the design of the Japanese version of this handplane is unique, as far as your humble servant is aware many other versions exist around the globe. The Japanese version has a wooden body, a laminated blade, and is significantly lighter in weight and smaller in volume than its counterparts. It is a superior tool, IMHO, but it can be quirky.\n\nThis plane can handle a number of tasks, but it specializes in planing a straight-sided groove or rabbet right up to an edge or line with a clean 90˚ inside corner. A few common applications include planing the tongue around the perimeter of a board to make the bottom of a drawer, and raising a panel in frame and panel construction. In construction work it is frequently used to pare and clean tenons in timbers, especially those cut with circular saws which tend to leave a step, and to fit finish woodwork, among many other tasks.\n\nThis plane is of course used by joiners, cabinetmakers, sashimonoshi, and furniture makers but you would be surprised at how popular it is with carpenters and timber framers for cleaning the 90˚ inside corners of joints such as tenons.\n\nCraftsmen who use kiwaganna typically own a two-piece set comprised of a right-hand and left-hand version to deal with tight access and changing grain direction. But the right-hand version is the most popular by far.\n\nAdvantages of the Kiwaganna Plane\n\nIn general, a skewed blade in a rabbet plane provides two benefits. The first is that the reaction forces pushing back on the blade include a vector that tends to push the plane towards the line, edge, inside corner or verge being planed to, making the plane more stable in the cut, an important factor where precision is necessary.\n\nThe second and perhaps most important benefit of the skewed blade, however, is the smoother cut and reduced tearout it makes possible, especially important when planing cross-grain.\n\nAnother benefit the skewed blade provides in the case of the Japanese kiwaganna is the point of the skewed blade penetrating the body of the plane and ending flush with the side of the body, making possible a zero-clearance cut to a line without the extra weight and cost of complicated mechanisms and reinforcing plates. It’s a deceptively simple but clever design.\n\nPoints to Keep In Mind\n\nWhile a simple tool, the kiwaganna often proves frustrating to first-timers. Indeed, your humble servant struggled with kiwaganna for far too long before he figured them out. To avoid similar damage to brain and ego, Beloved Customers that wish to become proficient in using this elegant tool will find it useful to understand the following nine points. The articles linked to below, while not written specifically about the kiwaganna, are nonetheless relevant and may prove helpful\n\n1. First, a brief inspection of the body and the cuts made to receive the blade will make it clear that kiwaganna dai (body) are more fragile than that of regular hiraganna planes, so when adjusting the blade, please use a wooden, plastic or rawhide mallet, not a steel hammer.\n\n2. When removing the blade, strike the dai at the same angle as the blade is inlet into the dai to reduce unnecessary stresses. This means you will hit the top corner of the dai on the side opposite where the blade’s point exits. Clip off and round over this corner of the dai with a knife or chisel to prevent your mallet from chipping the dai. Striking the opposite corner can have bad results.\n\n3. The first step in truing/adjusting the blade of a kiwaganna plane is to sharpen and polish the blade and uragane (chipbreaker) well, make sure they fit each other tightly without a gap near the cutting edge, and check that there is adequate and uniform clearance at the mouth so that shavings flow smoothly without clogging. The skewed nature of the blade and chipbreaker make this difficult to judge, so exercise caution. In many cases, the plane will work just fine, and maybe even better, without its uragane. The uragane has a bevel ground into its pointy corner. Make sure this is not touching the dai when inserted properly. Keep in mind that you will need to periodically grind this bevel down after sharpening the blade every few times or it will touch the dai creating a restriction where shavings will become jammed. When you sharpen the blade, you will also need to resharpen the uragane too to ensure they match each other tightly. Not every time, but once in a while. A lot of people fail to maintain the uragane and then suffer emotional anguish when their plane mysteriously stops working. Mystery solved.\n\n4. The right and left side edges of the blade must fit the retention grooves tightly where they exit the top surface of the dai. If the fit is too loose, the blade will be difficult to keep in alignment, but if the fit is too tight the blade may crack the dai during seasonal shrinkage. Older dai are usually safe, but a plane shipped from a wet Tokyo summer to a hellishly dry Arizona may experience problems. This article provides more details about fitting the body to the blade.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to shave the grooves, work very slowly and carefully. Color the blade’s side edges with pencil lead, marking pen ink or Dykem. Insert it into the grooves and note the high colored areas. Shave these down just a tiny tiny bit with a very sharp chisel, or a metal file, then insert the blade and check. Repeat as necessary. Don’t create a big gap between the walls of the groove and the sides of the blade (versus face and underside of the blade which must be tightly pinched in the grooves), just make sure the width of the blade is not wedged tightly between the grooves.\n\n5. Check that the “ear” of the blade (the chamfered corner at the cutting edge opposite the pointy corner) is ground back enough so it does not terminate inside the groove, because if it does, shavings will become jammed. Don’t forget that, with each sharpening, the sharp portion of the blade will become a little wider and this chamfer a little smaller. If it becomes too small, shavings will become jammed between the blade and retention groove, I promise you, so please grind this chamfer back after every few sharpenings.\n\n6. Here is wisdom: Contact between the back of the blade and the block should not be too high-pressure, otherwise the area on the sole behind the mouth may be pushed out making the plane misbehave, an extremely common problem with this plane. You want uniform pressure where possible to ensure the blade is stable, but remember that it is the grooves pinching the blade that keep it in place, not pressure on its back. This is important: If you find your plane stops cutting, it may be because the portion of the dai at the sole behind the mouth is being pushed out as the blade becomes shorter/thicker. The surest way to check this is to use a notched straightedge like the 400mm Matsui Precision product we carry. If the sole behind the mouth is pushed out such that it contacts the straightedge, use a scraper or whatever to pare/shave/scrape excess material away. Indeed, a gap at this area is better than contact. As the blade becomes gradually shorter after much use, its wedging action on the dai may increase pushing the sole behind the mouth out, lifting the cutting edge away from the surface of the wood you need to plane thereby preventing it from cutting consistently, if at all, so check for proper clearance occasionally.\n\n7. With the blade fitted to the grooves and most of the pressure relieved from its back, insert the blade. Check that it projects evenly from the mouth its full width. This is very important. If it projects further on one side than the other, resharpen/reshape the cutting edge so it projects perfectly uniformly. Uneven projection is almost always the result of the user unintentionally and gradually changing the angle of the skew over multiple sharpening sessions, and it always causes problems. Besides projecting uniformly from the mouth (when the sole directly in front of the mouth is perfectly flat), the point of the blade must penetrate the dai (body) and be flush with the outside surface of the sidewall. Heed these words: Failure to get these two subtle details right is the most common cause of failure to perform in the Kiwaganna plane.\n\n8. The mouth opening, in other words the gap between the blade and the sole of the dai where it exits the dai, must be narrow, and even in width, but not closed or skewed, otherwise shavings will jamb in the mouth, another common problem with kiwaganna. If the mouth is not even, use an adjustable steel protractor to match the angle of the blade measured from the side of the dai where the point of the blade exits. Remove the blade and mark the mouth with a sharp marking knife so the mouth is exactly the same angle as the blade. When doing this layout, be extremely careful to make the mouth opening of uniform width to match the cutting edge, but keep the mouth as narrow as possible. Use a sharp chisel to cut to this line making the mouth perfectly uniform. Insert a thin knife blade (or sharpened utility knife blade) into the mouth to shave and clean it after chiseling.\n\n9. There is nothing wrong with leaving the sole perfectly flat instead of having the hollowed-out areas typically added to standard hiraganna planes. Just make sure it is truly perfectly flat. I have no problem with using sandpaper on float glass to true the sole of a kiwaganna, but a card scraper is a better tool for the job.\n\nJuggling Blades\n\nAlthough we addressed them above, let’s review the two critical factors you must juggle to keep a kiwaganna working well. I’m repeating these points not because I doubt Beloved Customer’s intelligence, but only because repetition improves understanding.\n\nFirst, maintain the angle of the blade’s cutting edge so that it projects a uniform distance from the mouth (with the mouth/sole flat and true). To do this you must pay more attention when sharpening the blade than is normally necessary. If you get this wrong, nothing will go right.\n\nSecond, as mentioned above, to cut into the corner of the rabbet cleanly, the point of the sharpened blade must penetrate the sidewall of the dai and be perfectly flush with the sidewall but without projecting out past the sidewall when the blade is projecting the right amount from the mouth and uniformly across its width. If the skew of the blade is wrong, or the dai is warped or worn, this point will end up being either recessed inside the sidewall or projecting outside it. It needs to be flush with the sidewall. If it’s recessed, the plane can’t possibly cut a clean step in a rabbet because the step in the rabbet will push the plane away from the inside corner with each cut.\n\nOn the other hand, if the blade’s point projects out through the side wall of the plane and is not flush with it, the rabbet will be raggedy and a 90˚ inside corner will be difficult to produce. Either of these problems will eventually occur if Gentle Reader uses kiwaganna, sure as Murphy loves optimists.\n\nIf the point of the blade is not flush with the outside wall of the dai, you may need to either shave material from the side of the plane (not recommended) or grind down the side of the blade near the point, a drastic measure. This is seldom necessary, and when it is, the reason is almost always a badly warped dai.\n\nAs you can see, this is a juggling act, but so long as you focus on these two points, and maintain the proper skew angle, all the blades will remain gleefully spinning in the air as you grin from ear to ear (knock on wood).\n\nYMHOS\n\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about our tools, please click the “Pricelist” link here or at the top of the page and use the “Contact Us” form located immediately below.\n\nPlease share your insights and comments with everyone in the form located further below labeled “Leave a Reply.” We aren’t evil Google, fascist facebook, thuggish Twitter or a US government IT consultant and so won’t sell, share, or profitably “misplace” your information.

However, the technique actually pre-dates the 1700’s by many centuries.\n\nThe Traditional London Finish\n\nWhile the traditional London Finish got its name from the justifiably-famous products of the high-end London gunmakers, some of the most famous of which are named above, since ancient times this technique used to seal and finish high-quality woodwork employed linseed oil, the squeezings from the seeds of a stringy plant called flax.\n\nThe difference between the linseed oil widely used for paint production and woodworking and the flax seed oil sold as a health product in the West nowadays is simply the method used to extract the oil from the flax plant.\n\nOf course, Gentle Reader is no doubt aware that the fibers of the cotton plant have been used to make textiles since at least 6,000 BC, but what you may not realize is that it was rare and so labor intensive to produce that at times cotton fabrics cost more than silk in the West, as recorded in tax records of the time. Indeed, it wasn’t until the invention of the Cotton Gin in 1793 that cotton textiles became affordable for ordinary people. My point is that linen cloth made from the fiber of the flax plant, and spun cloth made from animal hair, such as wool, goat and camel, were the most common textiles available probably since Methuselah wore goatskin nappies.\n\nIndeed, flax can be grown in even poor soil, and can be spun and woven into useable thread and cloth in small lots in most any home, so “homespun linen” was once the cheapest most widely-used textile available worldwide, used for everything cotton, polyester, rayon and silk is nowadays, and linseed oil was an ordinary but economically-important by-product of flax production.\n\nThe London Finish made famous by the gunsmiths of Olde Londinium consisted of many coats of boiled linseed oil, betimes with some added dryers, forcefully rubbed into the wood by hand (the warm, bare hand, as a matter of fact), allowing days and weeks between coats for the oil to partially polymerize. Indeed, this manual application technique is the source of the term “hand-rubbed finish” that furniture and cabinet companies everywhere lie about applying in our time. If you have a free month, please give it a try.\n\nThis finish was also used for furniture and cabinetry since ancient times as referenced in texts of the era which is probably why some modern woodworkers, ignorant of chemistry and eager to employ historical techniques, still soak their projects in linseed oil potions.\n\nWhile the final product of the traditional London Finish is indeed subtly beautiful, it takes a long time to accomplish, it’s expensive, it does little to prevent moisture from moving in and out of the wood (and therefore allows the wood to rapidly expand and contract with varying moisture content), and it does little to protect the wood from damage. Other downsides include the fact that linseed oil gives a yellow cast to wood, which gunstock makers and other woodworkers historically compensated for by dying the wood slightly red using alcanet root.\n\nAlso, linseed oil never fully solidifies and so attracts grime, eventually oxidizing and turning black forming a “patina” many people admire without realizing its dirty nature.\n\nThe Modern London Finish\n\nThe wood finishing technique described in this article is a modern, improved version of the traditional London Finish, one developed by American custom gunstock makers looking to replicate the beauty of the antique London Finish while providing better durability and moisture resistance for their customer’s expensive firearms and eliminating the expensive and time consuming work of rubbing in stinky, yellowing, dirt-magnet, spontaneously combusting linseed oil.\n\nI learned about it when I was looking for a better finish for the stocks I made for my own smokepoles, everything from flintlock rifles and pistols to large-caliber bolt-action rifles. Through applying, using in the field, and comparing the long-term results of both the traditional linseed oil London Finish and this modern version, I came to treasure the modern version’s subtle beauty, durability and effectiveness at moisture control. Soon I was using it for everything from tool handles to furniture and casework with excellent results.\n\nThe primary difference between the traditional and modern versions of the London Finish is that the traditional technique relies heavily on boiled linseed oil, a product that does little to protect wood, while the modern technique relies on modern varnish or polyurethane resins, but with a twist.\n\nWhere the two finishes are alike is that neither are surface finishes, but are soaked into the wood’s fibers. By contrast, normally-applied varnish or PU finishes are film finishes that, while they may adhere to the wood well when fresh, do not penetrate deeply, but remain on the surface where they quickly degrade due to UV light exposure, and the stress cracks resulting from expansion and contraction of the wood. Eventually and unavoidably their bond with the wood they are tasked to protect or beautify always fails, usually sooner than later, whereupon it stops doing its job.\n\nThe modern London Finish is not a surface film but soaks into the wood’s fibers where it hardens, and is protected from UV and shrinkage damage. It also fills the wood’s pores sealing them long-term and forming a smooth, flat surface free of the dents and streaks at the wood pores that always develop when shrinkable varnish or PU are applied as a surface finish.\n\nMost importantly, it seals the wood with a durable material that cannot be removed without actually carving or abrading the wood away, protecting it from moisture/dirt/oil intrusion. This makes it a better and more attractive long-term finishing solution, one that, unlike the traditional London Finish, doesn’t need to be refreshed annually (yes indeed, annually).\n\nNext, allow your humble servant to present the performance criteria I consider important when selecting a wood finish for tools.\n\nPerformance Criteria\n\nThe following criteria are focused on improving the longevity, durability and stability of the wooden components of handtools used in woodworking. These include the wooden bodies of handplanes, and the wooden handles of chisels, axes, hammers and gennou.\n\nSo what do we need a finish used in these applications to accomplish?\n\nStability: Minimize moisture movement into and out of the wood cells due to humidity changes, perspiration and rain thereby reducing the swelling, shrinking and warpage of the wood. This is specially important for handplanes, gennou handles, and some types of furniture and cabinetry. A surface finish that quickly oxidizes, suffers UV degradation, becomes inflexible and suffers shrinkage cracks or is easily chipped and/or abraded won’t get the job done for long.\n\nProtection from oil and dirt: Prevent dirt, dust and oil from the user’s hands or the environment from penetrating below the wood’s surface keeping it cleaner. To accomplish this a finish must both fill the ends of open cells exposed at the surface with a water-proof, non-shrink plug (a “filler”) and seal the cells with a waterproof and oil-resistant chemical binder.\n\nInsect and Bacteria Protection: The finish must lock away the yummy smell of raw wood so bugs will go beetling on by without stopping to snack, set up house, or lay eggs. It must also prevent bacteria spores, nasty things always present in dirt, from taking root.\n\nAppearance: A smooth surface that looks like wood, not plastic or varnish.\n\nThese are only your humble servant’s criteria, of course; Your needs and expectations may vary.\n\nWhy Is the Expansion, Contraction and Stability of a Wooden Tool Component a Concern?\n\nTrees are water pumps. Evaporation at the leaves sucks water, and with it, dissolved chemicals up from the ground. After a tree dies, most of the water contained in its cells migrates out of the wood, the individual cells shrink in size and crinkle as they dry, and the cell walls become stiffer and much stronger. However, despite its transition from a flexible, moist, growing plant to a stiff, dry board, left as-is a dead wood cell does not abandon its God-appointed duty to pump water but will faithfully continue to absorb and expel water, albeit to a more limited degree than when it was alive and kicking, causing its dimensions to shrink and swell in response to changing moisture conditions in the surrounding environment.\n\nThe problem is that the rate water enters or leaves the wood cells varies with a number of factors. One such factor is the location of the cell within the block of wood, producing differential expansion/shrinkage along with stresses and warpage. Most importantly, end grain absorbs and releases moisture much more quickly than side/face grain does. Slowing down the rate of water gain/loss is important to minimize and equalize internal stresses and to keep a wood product stable.\n\nBesides the natural seasonal changes in humidity, modern air conditioning and heating equipment can create wild swings in ambient humidity, causing wooden components of furniture and tools, such as the bodies of Japanese handplanes, to warp, harming their ability to plane wood as intended. When this happens, and it will, time and effort is periodically required to adjust a wooden-bodied plane’s sole. This can be frustrating. Short of using a vacuum pump to suck heavy hardening resins into a board’s cells, it is nigh impossible to entirely prevent moisture from entering and leaving wood with changes in environmental humidity, and the dimensional changes, internal stresses, and warping that results.\n\nIn the case of a wooden-bodied plane, both ends and the surfaces inside the hole cut to receive the blade have exposed endgrain which absorbs and releases moisture quicker than side grain, so that when the humidity of the surrounding air increases, airborne water penetrates the endgrain faster than the sidegrain, and the endgrain surface at the body’s ends and inside the mouth swell first, causing dimensional changes and differential stresses, and often, warping.\n\nBy reducing the rate of absorption of moisture by the endgrain fibers to more closely match that of sidegrain fibers, swelling, shrinking and warping can be reduced. This is where the London Finish shines.\n\nSince learning this method, I have used it not only on my guns, but also on timber frames, doors, tools, workbenches, furniture, cabinets, chests, tansu, tsuitate, and other wood products with excellent results.\n\nDanish Oil\n\nA note about so-called “Danish Oil” finishes is called for at this point. Danish Oil is boiled linseed oil combined with thinners, dryers, and resins. It polymerizes much quicker than simple boiled linseed oil, and is much easier to apply. By itself, varnishes and polyurethanes will not soak far into the pores of the wood (xylem tracheid), but by reducing its viscosity with linseed oil and thinner, the liquid will soak further into the grain and pores before more-or-less hardening. While superior to plain BLO (boiled linseed oil), Danish Oil is still not effective at either preventing water migration, or protecting the wood from dirt and oils. And besides, it changes the color of the wood to which it is applied, it stinks and it starts fires. Nothing good.\n\nApplying the Modern London Finish\n\nThis technique requires only a few inexpensive tools and materials, and no equipment of any kind, but it does take some time and effort to apply.\n\nYou will need the following tools and supplies:\n\nClear varnish or polyurethane finish in a can. Gloss finish is fine, but I prefer a satin finish. Minwax PU works well, while Epifanes is the best I have experience using.\n\nThinner or mineral spirits. Not the water/acetone/oil-based low-VOC toilet cleaner sold at home centers. A professional-grade thinner from a Sherwin Williams store or other specialist paint store selling professional-grade materials is best.\n\nMixing container the size of a soup can or jam jar with a lid.\n\nSmall paintbrush, perhaps 3/4″ wide. Cheap is fine.\n\n320 grit and 600 grit wet-or-dry sandpaper.\n\nClean rags,\n\nBrown paper from shopping bags\n\nLatex/rubber gloves to keep finish mixture off hands. It can get messy.\n\nMasking tape.\n\nThe Finish Mixture\n\nThe finish mixture to be used is the varnish or PU you selected thinned 100% with thinner. You won’t need much to complete a few plane bodies or tool handles, less than half a soup can in fact, and it’s best to use in small batches. The lid will keep it from hardening between sessions. It’s not a lot of work, but with drying time, the process may take five or six days.\n\nThe Steps in Finishing a Wooden Handplane Body or Tool Handle\n\n1. Remove the blade and chipbreaker. Tape the chipbreaker retention rod with masking tape. In the case of gennou handles, tape the entire head except the wood exposed at the top surface of the eye. For chisel handles, tape the ferrule, crown and the striking end of the handle (you don’t want the finish mixture to soak into the end of the chisel handle because it will make the fibers too brittle.) For paring chisels like usunomi that are not struck with a hammer, soak as much of the mixture into the handle’s end as possible\n\n2. Apply the finish mixture to the end grain at the plane body’s ends and all surfaces inside the mouth. In the case of hammer/gennou handles, apply it most heavily to the butt and eye. Apply it heavily, frequently, and forcefully to encourage the wood to soak up as much as possible. Repeat until the wood won’t soak up more. This is the step that matters most. Apply to all other surface of the dai as well. Allow to dry overnight. There’s absolutely no need to put any effort into making it pretty at this stage.\n\n3. Repeat Step 2.\n\n4. Apply another coat of finish mixture, and while it is still wet, use small pieces of 320WD paper with fingers and sticks to wet-sand all surfaces thoroughly. The goal is to produce a fine slurry of finish mixture and sawdust, and to force this deep into the wood’s grain, especially end-grain, clogging the pores solid. Don’t sand the area in front of the plane body’s mouth hard enough or long enough to remove material, change its shape, or round over the corners, though! This is extremely important. This slurry, combined with the varnish/PU already hardened in the wood’s pores, will serve to drastically slow down moisture movement once it sets. It won’t stop it entirely, but it will moderate it more than spindle oil, linseed oil or Danish oil ever could, and it won’t crack or flake off leaving the wood unprotected. Don’t wipe off the wet slurry, but leave it standing/smeared on the wood’s surface and let it dry overnight. It will look terrible for now, but never fear for tis all part of a cunning plan (ツ)!\n\n5. Apply another coat of finish and wet sand with 320 grit WD paper again making sure to hit all the places you might have missed before and knocking down any hardened slurry from step 4. Allow to dry overnight.\n\n6. Wet sand with the finish mixture using 600 grit WD sandpaper this time. Be sure to sand down and completely and thoroughly remove any hardened finish or slurry remaining on the wood’s surface. This is important. After sanding, but before the mixture hardens, scrub it down with clean rags and/or brown paper from shopping bags to remove all remaining finish from the wood’s surface. Allow to dry overnight. You may need to repeat this step for best results.\n\n7. The next day examine the wood’s surface for any remaining finish/slurry visible on surfaces. Remove any you find with 600 grit WD sandpaper and the mixture.\n\n8. Allow to dry for 24 hours.\n\n9. Scrub with brown paper from a shopping bag.\n\n10. Apply automotive carnuba paste wax, and polish out.\n\nRemember that, if applied correctly, the London Finish as described herein should not create interference or change tolerances in the tool because there shouldn’t be any finish material left proud of any of the tool’s surfaces to cause interference.\n\nWhen finishing the blade retention grooves, you will find it difficult to sand up inside them with your fingers, so use sticks. But don’t remove much material in creating a slurry or the blade may become too loose. And be sure to remove any and all slurry or finish that remains on the surface.\n\nAt this point in the process, the London Finish is complete. It is well suited, in my opinion, for guns, tools, workbenches, doors, timber frames, as well as any furniture or casework where protection is desired but a surface finish is not desired. This finish also works exceptionally well for carved wooden surfaces, but with less sanding. It also has the distinct advantage that it does not require careful application, so if brush hairs or sawdust get caught in the finish, or bubbles or sags develop, never fear, because in accordance with our plan so cunning we could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel, they are all going to be wet-sanded away. If you decide to apply a final surface coat, however, then greater care is necessary for the final coat.\n\nIf you are doing casework or need an attractive surface finish, a topcoat or two of the same mixture, freshly made, applied with a clean brush is just the ticket. If a really nice finish is desired, several coats can be applied, wet sanding between each, and finally polishing with polishing compound (automotive paint supply houses carry this in many grits) to create a mirror finish.\n\nIf you feel brave enough to tackle large surfaces, such as a tabletop where this finishing technique excels, some time and effort can be saved by using a pneumatic or brushless random orbital sander. The type of motor matters because you don’t want a spark to ignite the thinner when wet sanding. You have been warned.\n\nA quick note on frame and panel construction is warranted at this point. If possible, it is best to apply the finish (any finish for that matter) to all surfaces of panels, especially endgrain, before gluing them into their frames. In any case, a bit of paste wax (I use beeswax-based Briwax) applied to the inside of frame rabbets and the edges of panels before assembly will prevent finish from accidentally gluing the panels into the frames, thereby restricting expansion and contraction, and eventually producing cracked panels.\n\nThe Story of Why I Started Using the London Finish for Plane Bodies\n\nBack in 2010 I was transferred from Orange County in Southern California to Tokyo, Japan. Due to an error by the moving company, most of my beloved tools were left behind in a storage unit In Las Vegas, Nevada, placing my sanity at imminent risk. I bought replacement chisels and planes (hiraganna, mentori, shakuri, etc) in Tokyo at that time. I had become dreadfully tired of the warpage that often developed in my plane bodies each time I moved, so I considered ways to reduce this nasty tendency, and of course, tried the London Finish I had been using on my gunstocks back in the USA. The results were perfect.\n\nAfter applying the London Finish to them in Tokyo, I used them for about a year through all the seasonal humidity changes common to Japan and exposed to indoor heating and cooling. They stayed straight the entire time. My job then transferred me to the Pacific island of Guam, with high temperatures and constant 85% humidity, where I used and stored these high-quality planes in a hot and humid garage for 1.5 years. They still stayed straight. When I returned to Tokyo, my wooden bodied planes again made the 35 day land and sea voyage inside a hot and humid container. They arrived at their new home straight. At the time I am writing this, those same planes have been in my home here in Tokyo for over 8 years through the various seasons and humidity changes, and have mostly remained straight.\n\nNot having to regularly true the soles of my wooden planes since then has saved me a lot of time and headaches (as he is wont, Murphy carefully ensured that they warped and stopped working at the most inconvenient time possible), and of course has extended their useful life.\n\nAnother special benefit in my case is the resistance the finish has to sweat, oils, acid and dirt from my hands, which, in my case, causes white oak to turn black almost immediately. This is doubly true in the case of my chisel and hammer handles.\n\nI have taught this method to many people that admired my completed woodworking projects and cabinets and handmade gunstocks, but few have had the patience required to actually attempt it. Of course, being all handwork, and taking quite a bit of time to accomplish, it is not suited to most commercial situations.\n\nAs for hobby woodworkers, there seem to be two schools of thought. The first hasn’t the patience to deal with any finish that can’t be applied with either a spraygun or power roller. Most of the woodworking publications energetically promote equipment-intensive commercial production methods even to the amateur, and feverishly foster this attitude. At the the risk of sounding cynical, I ask you Gentle Reader, is owning an airless spray system really necessary to perform quality woodworking, or is such equipment more of a profit center for manufacturers and retailers?\n\nWith this statement, I am certain I would receive piles of poisonous complaints from advertisers to this blog (if I had any), and perhaps even threats about pulling said advertisements. Good thing I don’t give a rodent’s ruddy fundament about such things or the feeling of rejection might crush my fragile ego like a raw egg in a little boy’s back pocket (シ)。\n\nAt the other extreme, there are devotees of the Neanderthal school that have been indoctrinated by romantic viewpoints in the woodworking press, or influenced by things written in books a hundred years ago. These gentle souls are drawn to archaic finishes such as boiled linseed oil, beeswax, and unicorn piss.\n\nTo the production-method advocates I say save production methods for production work, and seek better quality for your handmade projects.\n\nTo the Birkinstock-wearing Neanderthals I say, there is a reason old unrestored furniture and gunstocks are dark, grungy, and yes, dirty: Linseed oil and beeswax. Consider what you want your work to look like in 100 years. Certainly not cracked, water-damaged, and dirty. And genuine unicorn tinkle is practically impossible to come by nowadays, anyway, even on Amazon.\n\nI promise you the results will be worthy, with no downside, and your planes, tools handles and wooden projects will not only look better longer, but will be tougher and more stable.\n\nThe Abura Dai\n\nI would like to add a note here about a Japanese technique intended to improve the stability of handplane bodies, namely the “Abura Dai 油台” which translates to “Oil Body.”\n\nThe idea is to soak the oak body (dai) of a handplane in low-viscosity spindle oil until it takes up a significant amount thereby minimizing moisture exchange and improving the stability of the handplane’s body. Does it work?\n\nI own and use a 65mm abura dai handplane I purchased as a sample around 10 years ago, and which seems to be fairly stable. But I am not a fan of abura dai for two reasons. First, by design spindle oil never dries and is always wet. Therefore, the dai is always a little oily and definitely stinky. I don’t like the smell of spindle oil nor do I want to feel it on my hands unless I’m being paid for it.\n\nSecond, it makes the sole of the handplane softer, an area I would prefer remain harder, increasing wear noticeably. I was told about the failings of the abura dai by professional woodworkers many years ago, and the wear on the sole of this 65mm plane confirms their observations.\n\nI encourage Gentle Reader to give the London Finish a try. You will like the results. And please share your impressions with your humble servant and other Gentle Readers.\n\nUntil then, I have the honor to remain,\n\nYMHOS\n\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about our tools, please click the “Pricelist” link here or at the top of the page and use the “Contact Us” form located immediately below.\n\nPlease share your insights and comments with everyone by using the form located further below labeled “Leave a Reply.” We aren’t evil Google, fascist facebook, or treacherous TikTok and so won’t sell, share, or profitably “misplace” your information.

Martin, Syrio Forel, Game of Thrones,\n\nIn this the fourth article in our series about the Japanese hiraganna handplane, we will discuss how to fit the plane’s wooden body to the blade thereby improving the tool’s performance.\n\nAs is the case for most of the articles in this blog, this one too is intended primarily for the information and entertainment of our Beloved Customers, but all well-behaved Gentle Readers are welcome to partake. Bon apetit.\n\nWhy Fit Body to Blade?\n\nBeloved Customers may wonder why your most humble and obedient servant is inflicting the digital world with another pointless article about Japanese planes, especially since the handplanes purveyed by C&S Tools are advertised as “ready to use” when new. Please allow me to address this absolutely valid concern herein.\n\nAs mentioned in the Part 3 of the Japanese Handplane Series, Mr. Inomoto, the daiuchi shokunin that cuts the bodies of our planes from Japanese White Oak to fit the blades forged and sharpened by Mr. Nakano, does indeed do more than just cut a gap for a blade to slot into, but fits the body to the blade so each plane is able to produce a decent shaving before it leaves his workshop. However, due to cost considerations and practical limitations to his prodigious prophetic talents and clairvoyant insights regarding who will eventually own each plane, and their preferences for the blade-body marriage, he fits the blade on the tight side, assuming the end-user will fettle the body to best suit his own purposes. Ergo the paragraph titled “Plane Philosophy” in Part 3.\n\nI suspect relatively few Beloved Customers have given the subject serious thought, but it is nonetheless true that each owner of a Japanese plane must develop their own philosophy regarding the relationship between blade and body, and if they deem it necessary, adjust their plane body accordingly.\n\nThis article assumes Beloved Customer has decided to refine the fit between blade and body, and instructs in how to achieve those refinements. Are they absolutely necessary? Nah. Will they make a difference? Yes, but the degree of improvement achieved will vary from plane to plane and person to person.\n\nNonetheless, your humble servant recommends Beloved Customers, especially those interested in obtaining professional-level plane maintenance and usage skills, to perform the operations described in this and future articles in this series. You’ll be glad you did even if it may take some years for the benefits obtained to become evident. At the very least you may be fortunate enough to avoid the stupid mistakes YMHOS made when he was green.\n\nSo with that out of the way, let’s assemble the tools we will need to make some righteous sawdust.\n\nTools\n\nThe following is a list of tools I recommend for this job.\n\nWooden, plastic or rawhide mallet for striking the blade and body;\n\nCarpenter’s pencil and/or marking pen;\n\nMasking tape to protect the wooden body from oily/graphity fingerprints;\n\nCaliper (vernier, dial or digital) and/or divider for measuring and comparing;\n\nVarious chisels (e.g. 3mm, 6mm, 9mm usunomi paring chisels). Although it may seem strange, wider chisels are typically not necessary for this task.\n\nMetal file (to be modified) or a 15~18mm wide chisel (to be modified).\n\nRegarding the modified file or chisel listed above, this is a push scraper, a truly ancient tool once commonly used for precision metalwork. Your humble servant uses it to shave the bed to fit the blade. You can make this tool as wide as you wish, but please note that if the blade of either file or chisel is too wide, your shaving efforts may not produce smooth results.\n\nYou can easily make this scraping tool from a chisel or an old file by grinding a flat on the end of the file or cutting edge of the chisel square to the centerline of the blade and at an 80~90˚bevel angle. Then hone this square cutting edge and at least one of the two adjoining surfaces to 1000 grit. Voila.\n\nIf you adapt a file to make this tool you will want to attach a handle to its tang to avoid getting red sticky stuff on your pretty wood.\n\nIf you prefer to use a regular chisel, that’s OK too, but you will find this scraper does a cleaner job with less effort.\n\nBlade Preparation\n\nThis explanation assumes the blade is sharp and the ura is in good shape. If not, please sharpen the blade because it will of course affect the fit of blade to body.\n\nWhile you are at it, check that the side edges of the blade are free of burrs or rough grinder marks which might abrade the grooves after some use. Some grinder marks may be unavoidable, but if the sides feel rough and abrasive to the back of your hand, smooth the edges a little using a sander and/or sharpening stones.\n\nIn addition, please make sure the right and left clipped corners of the blade’s cutting edge, called “ears,” are properly trimmed, meaning that they are ground large enough to reduce the width of the sharp cutting edge so the cutting edge fills the width of the plane’s mouth but does not extend into the grooves, because if it does get into the grooves, shavings will become jammed between the blade and groove wasting your energy and leaving nasty scuff marks and sometimes even tracks on the planed surface. それは困る.\n\nWhen sharpening a plane blade, therefore, it is important to check and trim these ears periodically. A few passes on a diamond plate or rough stone will do the job; It doesn’t need to be pretty, and the ears don’t need to be sharpened because they will never touch the surfaces to be planed.\n\nChecking & Tuning the Mouth\n\nBeloved Customers won’t need to worry about this, but Gentle Readers fettling plane bodies made by themselves or others should be careful the first time they adjust the blade’s cutting edge to project through the mouth to ensure there is adequate clearance because if the mouth isn’t wide enough to allow the cutting edge to pass through cleanly with a little clearance to spare, the blade may chip out the sole.\n\nIf there is any question about the adequacy of your plane’s mouth/blade clearance, the first time you extend the blade through the mouth press the plane sole-down on a piece of clean wood while tapping the head of the blade with your mallet to make a zero clearance cut at the mouth. The supporting board will prevent the mouth from chipping. This is also standard practice when opening the mouth of a new plane body.\n\nHold the plane up to a light and peer through the mouth to observe the gap between cutting edge and body. The width of this gap must be greater than zero, and it should be constant the full width of the blade, but how wide it needs to be will depend on the thickness of the shaving you intend to cut.\n\nUgly tear-out can be minimized and the polish of the planed surface increased by having a tight mouth. Indeed, the tightness of the mouth and the area of the sole directly in front of the mouth applying uniform pressure on the wooden surface being planed up to the last .001 millimeter in front of the mouth is critical for exceptionally fine tearout-free cuts. On the other hand a mouth gap that is too narrow to pass the intended thickness of shaving will jamb every time, so the user must balance the width of the mouth, the desired shaving thickness, and blade projection to obtain good results.\n\nHere is wisdom: allowing shavings to repeatedly become tightly jammed in the mouth is not only hard on the blade, but it will damage the mouth, so before this happens too many times, you want to either adjust the mouth or your expectations for shaving thickness.\n\nTo open up or adjust the mouth, cut a hardwood guide block to use with a chisel to pare the mouth opening, and clamp it to the sole. The angle of the block will vary with the angle of the blade.\n\nThen, using an exceptionally sharp paring chisel and this guide block, take minute shavings at the mouth using skewed strokes. A paring chisel with a three-hollow mitsuura ura is ideal for this task, but any sharp chisel with a longish blade will do the job.\n\nBody Protection\n\nThis process will involve graphite pencils, marking pen ink and fingers, so to keep the wooden body from looking dirty, please cover the top and sides with a low-tack masking tape. In this example, I used a pretty pink tape.\n\nAdjusting the Blade to the Mouth\n\nAs mentioned above, the blade fits into and is clamped in-place in the wooden body by the two tapered grooves cut into the body. Sometimes the fit between the side edges of the blade and the bottom of these grooves is too tight. This can occur in a new plane if the body was improperly cut to begin with, but the most common cause is shrinkage of the body due to humidity changes.\n\nOf course, the wooden body will change dimensions with changes in ambient humidity, while the blade won’t. If a plane is shipped from a highly humid climate like Japan (at some times of the year) to a dry climate like the Mojave Desert (all times of the year), for example, the body may shrink in width developing tremendous pressure on the side edges of the blade, sometimes enough to crack or split the body. Therefore, if you are located in a dry climate and acquire a plane from a wetter climate, it may be wise to remove the blade and let the body acclimatize for a week or so.\n\nAs mentioned above, the blade is tapered in width, being wider at the head and narrowest near the cutting edge. This is intentional. Ideally, you want the side edges of the blade to just kiss the bottom of the grooves where they exit the top surface of the body, and not touch the bottom of the grooves anywhere else. This type of fit will make it easy to make minute right or left adjustments to the cutting edge’s projection by tapping the shoulders of the blade right or left.\n\nObviously (and this is an important point to understand), if both of the blade’s side edges are in close contact with the bottom of the grooves their full-length, this important method of adjustment will be no bueno.\n\nUse you vernier, dial or digital caliper or mechanical divider to check that the blade does indeed become narrower in width from the point where it exits the grooves at the top surface of the body and the point where the cutting bevel begins. If it doesn’t, you will need to grind in some taper. How much? Mr. Nakano’s blades typically taper the amounts shown in the photos above, but they are handmade and each one is little different.\n\nIn any case, please ensure the body provides adequate clearance to just accommodate the blade’s width. Mark-1 Eyeball is often good enough for this task, but a divider is better and a caliper is ideal for this task.\n\nMake a final check by applying marking pen ink to the sides of the blade 1cm down from where the blade would normally exit the grooves at the top surface of the body. More ink is not necessary.\n\nIf some paring of the grooves is necessary to provide adequate clearance, please remove no more wood than is absolutely necessary.\n\nRemember that we want just a little clearance between the blade’s sides and the top of the grooves, as shown in the photos above, and more clearance at the bottom of the grooves to make it easy to adjust the blade’s projection from the mouth.\n\nGroove Maintenance\n\nA common problem we see with old planes is cracked and split bodies caused by the tapered blade becoming shorter over the years due to repeated sharpenings, and therefore the edges of the blade exerting excessive pressure on the bottom of the grooves when a careless user mercilessly pounds the blade into the body. This sort of damage is entirely avoidable by humans, but some gorillas advocate paring the bottom of the grooves of new planes to create a gap of 2~2.5mm between the groove and blade to accommodate all the reduction in length the blade may experience over many years of service at once. To this practice, your most humble and obedient servant can only respond “Poppycock!”\n\nWhy do I object to what seems to be a logical solution? Glad you asked.\n\nIf you chisel out a big gap between the side edges of the blade and bottom of the groove, not only will you unnecessarily weaken the body by severing continuous wood fibers at the narrowest, weakest, most critical point of the body (think about it real frikin hard), but the pivoting action required to adjust the blade’s projection right and left by tapping the head right and left will become more difficult, while at the same time the blade will become less stable in the body.\n\nI write this based on bitter experience obtained from following bad advice received before I knew better, and later being mocked by more experienced craftsmen who noticed my silly error. An embarrassing episode indeed, one I was ashamed of for many years.\n\nBeloved Customers will of course have purchased a high-quality plane from C&S Tools, with a blade hand-forged by Mr. Nakano Takeo and a Japanese White Oak body cut by Mr. Inomoto Isao, but just in case you are working on a lower-grade tool, here are some things you need to check.\n\nThe way to avoid body damage due to shrinkage of body or increase in blade width blade is simple: (1) Pay attention to the fit of the blade in the grooves; (2) Adjust the clearance when appropriate by either shaving the bottom of the blade retention grooves or grinding the blade’s side edges, and; (3) Avoid excessive use of recreational mushrooms which may dull the senses and cause chronic tool neglect.\n\nIn other words, when you notice the blade becoming tight in the grooves, simply pare the bottom of the grooves a nat’s mustache hair deeper. Don’t get carried away because a little contact is a good thing!\n\nOur 6mm and 3mm usunomi paring chisels are ideal for this job. but standard oiirenomi chisels can accomplish the task too.\n\nAnother option is to grind the sides of the blade making the blade a little narrower in width.\n\nBeloved Customer has the choice of learning from your humble servant’s stupid mistakes or from your own. Of course, I suppose there’s always the default option too many lost and wandering souls select of neglecting to learn anything at all…\n\nFitting the Bed to the Blade’s Back\n\nAssuming Beloved Customer has completed the checks and adjustments in the previous sections, the general steps for fitting the bed to the blade are as follows:\n\nBegin by rubbing the back of the blade from where the cutting bevel begins to the end of the steel lamination with your carpenter’s pencil giving it a light coat of graphite. Marking pen ink or Dykem works too.\n\nInsert the blade into the grooves and tap it with your wood, plastic or rawhide metal mallet (egads, not a metal hammer!) until the cutting edge is nearly projecting from the mouth. You may need to really wack the blade hard 5~10 times to accomplish this the first time.\n\nNext remove the blade by holding the plane in your hand and alternating strikes on the right and left sides of the chamfer on the body behind the blade’s head. Don’t strike the flat end of the body! The blade should wiggle out after some less-than-gentle persuasion. If your plane doesn’t already have a pretty 6~8mm wide chamfer cut on this edge, please make one.\n\nExamine the bed. You will notice how areas in contact with the blade are now marked with graphite. We need to pare or scrape down these contact points to achieve a more uniform contact. Don’t fiddle with the grooves yet.\n\nUse your chisel or scraper tool to carefully shave down the high spots marked with graphite. Cut/scrape only those areas marked with graphite. Before you begin making sawdust, however, please be careful to not remove any wood from any of the three surfaces inside each side groove (blade retention groove) for now. You need to sneak up on the final shape of the bed like a kitten stalking a grasshopper, with eyes wide open, gently and a little bit at a time. Be careful not to twitch your tail! It would be a serious mistake to try to make a perfect fit after only a few passes.\n\nRepeat steps 2~5. You may need to do this kitten stalk 10 times to get it right. You won’t need to apply more graphite each time, just rub the back with a piece of cloth to redistribute the graphite. Or you can use your carpenter’s pencil again. With each iteration, the graphite marks left on the bed will increase in number and become larger. You want to be able to seat the plane blade with only three or four medium strikes with your mallet, and make fine adjustments with just a few more. At no time should your plane squeal a complaint.\n\nWhen the blade can be easily seated with 3 or four medium wacks of your mallet, use a metal file to lightly smooth out the rest of the bed. Perfection is neither attainable nor should it be sought.\n\nThe Peppermint Twist\n\nNow that the bed is fitted to the blade, we need to return our attention to the grooves.\n\nIf one groove is pinching the blade significantly more than the other, the blade will want to twist out of alignment. This can be very irritating.\n\nThe surfaces inside the grooves touching the ura and back of the blade should be clean and straight. In any case, unless it causes a serious performance problem, it’s best to leave these surfaces alone for a while because after inserting and removing the blade several times the fit may improve automatically.\n\nIf the blade continues to twist out of alignment, however, determine where the high points are on the surface of the groove touching the blade’s ura. You can do this by peering into and through the mouth while shining a light into the groove.\n\nOnce you have identified the high spot(s) glue a piece of fine sandpaper to a thin stick of wood and sand it down a little bit at a time between inserting and removing the blade frequently to check the fit.\n\nDon’t sand down the surface inside the groove which contacts the blade’s back unless absolutely necessary because this will effectively open up the mouth, something we want to avoid for as long as possible.\n\nWith this, your plane’s hard, sharp blade and soft wooden body should fit together like hand in glove. It may sound like a lot of work, but it usually isn’t. In fact, besides prepping the blade, the whole process can usually be completed in less time than it takes to read about it.\n\nSo far in this series your humble servant has provided a lot more detail and explanation than I have ever seen in writing elsewhere. It took me many years of fumbling in the dark, much consultation with older, more experienced craftsmen, no few curses and ungentle slaps to the back of the head, and numerous expensive mistakes to learn these things. I hope Beloved Customer profits from them.\n\nIn the next post in this ongoing adventure towards the perfect Japanese handplane we will shift our attention to marrying the chipbreaker (uragane 裏金) to the blade.\n\nY’all come back now, y’hear.\n\nYMHOS\n\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about our tools, please click the “Pricelist” link here or at the top of the page and use the “Contact Us” form located immediately below.\n\nPlease share your insights and comments with everyone in the form located further below labeled “Leave a Reply.” We aren’t evil Google, fascist facebook, or thuggish Twitter and so won’t sell, share, or profitably “misplace” your information.

Why? Because to become proficient at using and maintaining the Japanese handplane, one must understand it more than just superficially, indeed, a healthy and mutually respectful relationship should be Beloved Customer’s goal.\n\nIn addition, I will be so bold as to briefly present the story of a single plane blade made for a famous carpenter by a famous blacksmith.\n\nThe Shin Un Mu Blade 神雲夢の刃\n\nThe plane blade pictured at the top of this article was forged 6 years after the end of World War II by a famous Tokyo blacksmith named Kato Hiroshi (加藤 廣 1874～1957), who used the nom de forge of Chiyozuru Korehide, (千代鶴是秀 ). The Chiyozuru name has been copyrighted and is still in use to this day, although the current holders of the rights to the name are unworthy to even pour Mr. Kato a beer, if Mr. Kato was still a drinking man.\n\nChiyozuru-san forged this blade at the request of a famous Tokyo carpenter named Nomura Sadao. The engraving on the back states the blade (and matching chipbreaker) was made by him for Nomura Sadao and was completed on June 4, 1951. I’m told Chiyozuru-san charged Nomura-san ¥10,000, a huge amount back in the day.\n\nYou will notice that it looks different from most plane blades in that it lacks the beveled “ears” at the right and left corners of the blade’s cutting edge commonly seen in Japanese plane blades intended to prevent the cutting edge from extending into the grooves on each side of the blade opening used to retain the wedge-shaped blade in-place thereby preventing wood shavings from becoming jammed between the groove and blade leaving unsightly marks on the surface of the wood being planed. More on this below.\n\nThe blade in question, however, has rabbets cut into the jigane at the left and right edges of the blade so the ura area is thicker than the sides which fit into the retaining grooves, and the cutting edge, therefore, does not intrude into the grooves, making beveled ears unnecessary. This is a very logical solution, although as it was explained to me by Tsuchida Noboru-san, it was not actually invented by either Chiyozuru-san or Nomura-san, but a design Nomura-san first observed at a technical school for cabinetmakers. He then made a wooden full-scale model and asked Chiyozuru-san to forge it for him.\n\nWhile it is an elegant solution to a real performance issue, it is much more difficult to make this style of blade than the conventional one, and so never became popular.\n\nOn the subject of materials, Chiyozuru is well known for preferring to use imported steel, mostly from England, instead of traditional domestic Tamahagane steel. Although the source of the soft jigane is uncertain, there can be no doubt the steel lamination is made of British high-carbon steel.\n\nGentle Readers are no doubt aware that Japan has always been a land of many disasters, some man-made and others natural, with earthquakes and city-destroying fires being especially common. To protect this important blade from becoming lost to posterity, as were so many valuable things during the war, upon his retirement Nomura-san entrusted the blade to the Takenaka Carpentry Tools Museum located in Kobe, Japan.\n\nIronically, a large earthquake struck Kobe on January 17, 1995 killing over 6,400 people and tearing the city a new one. Fortunately, while the museum’s exhibits were jumbled up, this blade was not damaged.\n\nUpon Nomura-san’s reassignment to the big lumberyard in the sky, his heirs formally donated the blade to the same museum where it remains to this day.\n\nThe four Chinese characters engraved into the face of the blade read, from top down, 神雲夢, pronounced “Shin, Un, Mu” which translates directly into English as “God, Cloud, Dream.” No doubt there is some deep poetic meaning being expressed through these three characters, but it is far above the poor understanding of your humble, barely-literate servant.\n\nInterpretations from Beloved Customers and Gentle Readers are welcome.\n\nDefinition of Fettle\n\nWhile we are on the subject of literacy, I would like to clarify the meaning of a word pertaining to working on tools, and especially planes.\n\nGentle readers have no doubt heard the word “fettle” used in the phrase “fine fettle,” usually referring to someone being in good health or physical condition. But it has other, older meanings.\n\nIn the British dialect, it means “to set in order,” or “to get ready,” from Middle English fetlen to shape, prepare; perhaps akin to Old English fetian to fetch.\n\nYour humble servant commonly uses the word fettle as a verb, mostly for truing or adjusting a plane or other tool.\n\nNever let it be said that the Gentle Readers of the C&S Tools blog are less than exquisitely erudite and edumacated.\n\nBlade Details\n\nMisunderstandings abound and deep, pungent rivers of BS frequently burst their banks when the details of the Japanese hiraganna plane’s blade are discussed; Buckets, mops and even garbage pumps are necessary to clean up the mess. I despair: What to do, what to do?\n\nWhile it appears to be a simple, crude, even haphazard component to the uninformed, the design of a well-made plane blade is subtle and its execution elegant. I am confident Beloved Customers willing to ignore ridiculous internet rumor along with the squeals, grunts and farts emanating from the orc-infested woodworking forums, and forego magic mushrooms for a time will quickly understand. So without further ado, let’s turn on the pumps and get our mops moving.\n\nLaminated Construction\n\nThe plane’s blade is made by forge-weld laminating a piece of hard high-carbon steel to a larger piece of softer low/no carbon steel/iron. These details are discussed in more detail in the two posts linked to below. It is important to understand these details if Beloved Customer intends to become skillful in using and maintaining Japanese planes.\n\nSharpening Part 8 – Soft Iron 地金\n\nSharpening Part 9 – Hard Steel & Soft Iron 鍛接\n\nThe Ura\n\nThe blades of quality Japanese chisels and planes have a hollow-ground area on the surface of the blade called the “flat” in the case of Western planes. In the case of plane blades, it is located on the surface your humble servant calls the “face,” which is oriented upwards facing the user when installed in the body. An accurate understanding of this structural detail is essential to using and maintaining the Japanese handplane. We discussed this detail in a previous article linked to below. Please review this post if you haven’t done so previously.\n\nSharpening Part 10 – The Ura 浦\n\nWe discussed how to perform periodical maintenance on the ura in an earlier post. Oh joy!\n\nBlade Retention\n\nThe blade of the Japanese handplane is retained in its wooden body by the pinching action on the face and back (top and bottom surfaces) of the blade inside the tapered grooves cut into each side of the mouth opening, not pressure on the side edges. This arrangement eliminates the dedicated wedges, usually made of wood, employed since at least Roman times to retain the blades of Western planes. It also makes irrelevant the widgets and linkages common to modern planes such as the Bailey-pattern, considered by many to be the pinnacle of plane design in the West. Simple is best, don’t you agree?\n\nA common misunderstanding about Japanese planes is that pressure between the wooden body and the back of the blade is necessary to both lock the blade into the body and to eliminate chatter resulting from blade vibration. In response, your humble servant can only turn up the speed dial on the garbage pump and say “poppycock!”\n\nExcept in the case of a poor quality body/blade, or one damaged through improper setup and maintenance, the pinching forces, and resulting friction, acting on the front and back of the narrow portion of the blade inserted into the two grooves in the body’s mouth must be sufficient to hold the blade in-place without relying on pressure on the blade’s back. If you know anyone who disagrees with this statement, rest assured the brown stuff dribbling out of their ears is not chocolate mousse.\n\nUnlike the potato chip-thin blades common to many Western planes, the quality Japanese plane blade of the sort we carry with its relatively thick, laminated construction may have a few female characteristics such as beauty, elegance, and a cutting wit, but despite fitting into a truly tiny mouth it simply will not chatter. After all, it’s chisels and squares that love to gossip.\n\nWhile a tiny amount of uniform contact and pressure between the bed in the wooden body and the back of the blade is desirable to steady the blade in-use, many fit their blades (or perhaps “neglect to properly fit their blades” would be a more accurate description) to develop high pressure between blade and bed, making it difficult to adjust the blade and distorting the body unnecessarily. In extreme cases, this pressure can even push out the sole, preventing the plane from working entirely, a situation that has shaken many a poor woodworker to the core! Pixie involvement cannot be dismissed. If your plane is misbehaving, this bulging sole phenomenon is something you would be wise to check for and remedy if found. You have been warned.\n\nWe will discuss this subject more in future posts.\n\nLengthwise Taper\n\nA casual observation reveals that the blade is tapered in thickness along its length, being thickest at the head sticking proud of the body, and thinnest at the cutting edge bevel.\n\nThe purpose of this taper is simply to wedge the blade into the grooves in the body. Please note that this wedging action does tend to cause the body to deflect to some degree, something which must be taken into account when fettling the sole, a subject we will discuss in a future post in this series.\n\nTransverse Taper\n\nThe blade is also tapered in its width, being widest at the head and narrowest at the cutting bevel.\n\nIdeally the side edges of the blade are in intimate contact with the bottoms of the retention grooves only where they exit at the top surface of the body, but should normally have no contact in the grooves elsewhere, making it possible to adjust the blade’s projection through the mouth to a uniform distance by gently tapping its head either right or left a small amount.\n\nCurved Back\n\nFinally, please observe that the back (vs. the ura) of a quality blade is not flat, but is slightly hollow-ground around the centerline of the blade’s length. The depth of this hollow should be more-or-less uniform over the blade’s length, disappearing near the head and shoulders.\n\nOne purpose of this detail is of course to lighten the blade’s weight, but more importantly it helps keep the blade from twisting out of alignment in-use. If you have ever made a wooden plane body in the Krenovian style to fit a blade with a flat back, you may have experienced the irritating tendency of the blade to twist out of alignment under heavy planing forces. This is typically not a concern with the Japanese design because of the curved back detail, so long as the body’s bed is well-fitted to the blade.\n\nSince each blade and its matched wooden body are a little different, and not yet in perfect accord when new, fitting the body to the blade is one of the first things one must do to a new plane. This fettling operation will be the subject of a future post.\n\nCommon Sense and Plane Philosophy\n\nTraditionally, everywhere planes were used around the world, a craftsman would commission or purchase the metal parts for his plane and cut the wooden body himself.\n\nIn recent history in Japan professional plane body makers called “daiuchi shokunin” 台打ち職人, which translates directly to “plane-body beater” (I kid you not) have become common. These craftsmen fit blade to body making a nearly complete retail product.\n\nMany of these ostensibly completed planes are sold in a “sugu tsukai” 直ぐ使い condition, meaning “ready-to-use.” As witness of this, such planes usually have a wood shaving resting in their mouths when sold. However, the fit between blade and body is intentionally very tight to allow for the end-user to fit the body to the blade and adjust it to his preferences. This is where philosophy comes into play.\n\nThere are regional preferences in Japan when it comes to tools, including sickles, saws, axes, adzes, chisels and of course plane blades. In far Eastern Japan, especially the Tohoku area and Hokkaido, thicker, heavier plane blades are preferred, whereas in Tokyo and Western Japan, thinner blades are traditional.\n\nBut while discussions of these differences make the hearts of historians go pitter patter, they are irrelevant to persons living outside Japan, so we will ignore them for now.\n\nThere are, however, two general, practical approaches to blade size and fit of which Beloved Customers should be aware. Namely, architectural (residential and temple) carpenters tend to prefer thicker blades that fit very tightly into the body because such planes tend to retain their settings better in the rough conditions of a construction jobsite. The downside to the thick blade is that it’s heavier, it takes longer to sharpen, and it’s more difficult to make fine adjustments to.\n\nCraftsmen that do finer, more precise work such as joiners, sashimonoshi, furniture makers and cabinet/tansu makers typically prefer thinner blades that are quicker to sharpen and easier to frequently adjust to make fine, precise cuts. Is your humble servant suggesting that carpenters tend to be less-skilled, or less delicate in using planes than joiners, furniture makers and cabinetmakers? In general, yes.\n\nWe have Mr. Nakano forge the blades for our planes more in the Tokyo style: thicker than some but thinner than most.\n\nNot knowing who will purchase the plane, unless directed otherwise most daiuchi shokunin cut tight-fitting bodies more suited to the carpenter, and assume the user will adjust the blade/body fit to their preference. This is the only practical solution in a “ride it like you stole it” handplane, but the reality is that too often the pressure on the back of the blade is so high it ends up creating problems for the user.\n\nToo many inexperienced users of Japanese planes, especially amateurs located overseas, learn how to use Japanese planes without knowledgeable supervisors or fellow workers near at hand to notice their mistakes, wack them upside the head, and tell them how to correct their errors (welcome to the gentle world of the Japanese craftsman), and consequently never really figure out how to setup, fettle and maintain Japanese handplanes. I suspect a similar lack of expert supervision is why so many Western woodworkers who give Japanese planes a try fail to ever get satisfactory performance out of them and become frustrated, eventually selling them on PeeBay.\n\nWhile your humble servant is eager to provide Beloved Customers all practical support and encouragement, the guidance I can provide is limited by distance, the written word, and the undeniable fact that he is a gentleman of great refinement and exquisite sensitivity (She Who Must Be Obeyed has been known to disagree, but what does she know?).\n\nTherefore, upon making a significant mistake, Beloved Customers must instead call themselves rude names and slap their own heads to aid learning retention. May I suggest “Blockhead” as an appropriate self-imprecation in the case of planes? (ツ)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post we considered some of the unique design features of the Japanese hiraganna handplane’s uncompromising and bitterly sharp iron and steel blade.\n\nWe even examined a historically-important, unusual, and exceptionally beautiful blade made by a famous blacksmith for a famous craftsman with curious engraving of mysterious meaning.\n\nAnd we discussed regional differences in tool design. You can’t make this stuff up, ladies and germs.\n\nIn the next adventure in this series we will turn our attention to the body of the Japanese handplane, the softer, gentler, wooden component of the tool, the one with the tiny mouth that directs and controls the work of cutting.\n\nAnd I promise we will make some sawdust. Until then, I have the exquisite honor to remain,\n\nYMHOS\n\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about our tools, please click the “Pricelist” link here or at the top of the page and use the “Contact Us” form located immediately below.\n\nPlease share your insights and comments with everyone using the form located further below labeled “Leave a Reply.” We aren’t evil Google, fascist facebook, or thuggish Twitter and so won’t sell, share, or profitably “misplace” your information.
