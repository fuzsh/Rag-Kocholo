        "text": "The âTsubaki-kaiâ is a group show launched in 1947 with the reopening of the Shiseido Gallery following the wartime suspension of its activities. Named after the camellia (tsubaki) of the Shiseido symbol mark, and grounded in the belief that art has the capacity to offer hope and courage, Tsubaki-kai exhibitions have been staged even at times of post-war restriction, disaster and recession, out of a desire to help the world flourish once more. Serving as the main exhibition of the Shiseido Gallery for over 70 years now, and featuring a different lineup of artists in every era, to date the Tsubaki-kai has showcased the work of a total of 86 talented art practitioners.\n\nMembers of the 8th Tsubaki-kai, which started last year, are Hiroshi Sugito, Ryuji Nakamura, Nerhol, Futoshi Miyagi, Aiko Miyanaga, and [mÃ©]. Their cross-genre activities and collaborations, and team-based production, make all these artists especially representative of their era. Here at Shiseido Gallery, until 2023 we will join them to ponder the possibilities and challenges of a post-corona ânew world.â\n\nCoronavirus pandemic has also changed the mindset of artists and their gaze toward the world. Last year, on the theme of âImpetus,â the artists made selection from the art collected by Shiseido at previous Tsubaki-kai exhibitions works that spark ideas around this ânew world.â By presenting what they have chosen from the collection, and their personal responses to it, via their own works and methods, they attempted to bring new perspectives to the collection works, and create links between these, and the future. In 2022, the artists work with each other and engage with experts in other fields in a âQuestâ to explore questions and realizations from the first year, and present works arising from these interactions.\n\nWe held a monthly meeting this year to share ideas with each other. Along with new keywords such as \"inside and outside,\" \"private and public,\" and \"richness in life\" that emerged there, we will try to create a platform for their expressions while building relationships with each other. We will share the process of creating the exhibition through Shiseido Gallery Twitter and website.\n\nThe logo of \"8th Tsubakikai Tsubakikai 8\" is newly designed by Yoshihisa Tanaka (graphic designer / Nerhol) every year.\n\nMeeting for âQUESTâ â ¢\n\nHomework: research on river\n\nFutoshi Miyagi: There is a place you can see it but you can't get close to, or you know itâs there, but you canât see.\n\nAiko Miyanaga: Talked with my child that the river is connected to the sea. We also talked about the meaning of colors and shapes of the national flag. This is a cookie box where my child drew about the recent war and weather forecasts by watching TV news.\n\nRyuji Nakamura: The place where building is never built. Relation between man-made and natural.\n\nNerhol: Looking at the waterside calm us down. It would be nice if you could somehow experience your way to the river when you enter the exhibition.\n\n[mÃ©]: The feeling of surrendering to the flow of ideas, not confirming to each other one meaning or answer, and the feeling of not desperately chasing something. The binary opposition are tiring, so dare to escape from the meaning, with a \"river\" that we have no attachment to, and these feelings will lead to the idea of \"less than a work\"."
