        "text": "Yokohama BayStars manager Alex Ramirez is wearing two hats as the regular season winds down.\n\nOne one hand, Ramirez is trying to guide the BayStars to wins in their final two games of the season to keep alive their hopes of overtaking the Yomiuri Giants for second place in the Central League. On the other, the first-year manager is assessing his players' readiness for the upcoming CL Climax Series, which will be the first postseason appearance for many of them.\n\n\"The Climax Series of course is a totally different game,\" Ramirez said Friday. \"It's a different feeling for the games. Some of our players have never been in that kind of environment. The Giants have always been in the Climax. For me to say, 'this is what we're going to try to do' is a little bit hard at this point."
