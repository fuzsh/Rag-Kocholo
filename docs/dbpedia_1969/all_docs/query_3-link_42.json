This Special Session welcomes contributions that concern rationale, theories, pedagogies, and best practices for the use of computers for language teaching and learning. The goals are to stimulate discussion among Technology-Enhanced Language Learning (TELL) scholars/practitioners about the advantage and issues of current research and practices in the use of advanced technology in language education, and to provide insights into the design, development, and evaluation of language learning environment using technology for successful language instruction. We invite TELL researchers to submit original research work in the following topics, but not limited to:\n\nLTLE-WSS2: Visualization of Educational Effects and Measurement of Their Effects\n\nOrganizer: Takeshi Matsuda (Hannan University, Japan)\n\nSummary: Educational activities utilizing ICT are used not only in schools but also in various situations such as training at companies. From this background, learning logs are being recorded in various formats, and it is very important problem to consider methods to make effective use of such data. In particular, it may be considered that visualization of learning logs can provide useful information for both learners and teachers. The simplest methods are to use traditional methods such as histograms and pie charts to visualize statistics information. However, various methods can be applied to data visualization such as gamification and multimedia graphics, nowadays. Therefore, this session focuses on visualization of education and utilization of learning logs. The session also welcomes research such as proposals for efficient learning methods and learning log analysis using machine learning and deep learning.\n\nDSIR 2021 Special Sessions\n\nDSIR-WSS1: Open Science, Library Science, and Research Promotion\n\nOrganizers: Takaaki Aoki (Nagoya University, Japan), Miho Funamori (National Institute of Informatics, Japan), Yuta Hashimoto (Natinal Museum of Japanese History, Japan) Yasuyuki Kano (The University of Tokyo, Japan), Hiroshi Masui (Kitami Institute of Technology, Japan), Eiri Ono (Kyoto University, Japan), Michiko Yasukawa (Gunma University, Japan)\n\nSummary: This special session focuses on discussing research promotion from the perspective of open science, library science, and other related research fields. Research data should be properly managed and research seeds should be duly evaluated to promote scientific research. Furthermore, research groups should be properly funded.\n\nOpen science is a movement that makes scientific research accessible to amateurs and professionals. The need to make scientific knowledge available to the public is evident. However, no definitive solution for evaluating and facilitating open science has been introduced so far. While it is technically common to store and share research data in a digital format, it is nontrivial to determine a policy for the management and dissemination of open data.\n\nThe scientific impact of research should be evaluated and opportunities for research funding should be provided, to promote advanced research in higher education and provide necessary incentives. Traditionally, bibliometrics and scientometrics are the fields of study in which the evaluation of the scientific impact of research papers is a subject of interest. When scientific research having a huge impact on society is underestimated by traditional metrics, alternative measures or methods should be devised for an accurate evaluation of the impact. Altmetrics are nontraditional bibliometrics that have been proposed as an alternative to citation impact metrics. They can be applied to a wide range of evaluation targets, such as people, books, datasets, and source code repositories. Library science technology can be applied to the database analysis of books and other data.\n\nResearch data management (RDM) is a generic activity through which researchers create, collect, store, analyze, share, and publish research data. To promote efficient RDM, various problems should be solved from multiple viewpoints, such as the obligations of researchers, the choice of suitable IT systems, and the analysis and understanding of research disciplines.\n\nThis special session, “Open Science, Library Science, and Research Promotion,” extensively discusses potential problems and innovative approaches to the alternative solutions of research promotion, including policy development, data management, the evaluation of the research impact, and the IT systems required for these purposes.\n\nDSIR-WSS2: Eduinformatics (Education + Informatics) of Higher Education\n\nOrganizers: Kunihiko Takamatsu (Kobe Tokiwa University, Japan), Nobuhiko Kondo (Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan)\n\nSummary: About 15 years ago, the human genome consortium, which consists of many researchers from all over the world, had sequenced the whole human genome that includes about three Giga base pairs. Many informaticians joined the human genome project adding the two fields of computers and informatics to this project because the original researchers found it impossible to analyze the data manually. This phenomenon led to the creation of a novel interdisciplinary field called bioinformatics, which is so named because it combines the two fields of biology and informatics. Recently, research on higher education has increased greatly. Additionally, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) promoted the establishment of Institutional Research (IR) in Japanese universities. This situation is similar to the era when bioinformatics was being developed. This is especially true since a lot of educational research is “evidence-based” similar to evidence-based medicine. However, this type of research is extremely difficult with conventional pedagogical techniques alone. Higher education can develop dramatically if researchers can apply informatics to their data, for example, statistics, machine learning (AI), data science, and so on, just as biology developed dramatically with the advent of bioinformatics. In this special session, I would like to discuss the “Eduinformatics” of higher education. I would also like to use this opportunity to enable the improvement of higher education.\n\nDSIR-WSS3: Merit and Demerit of the net use in higher education\n\nOrganizer: Nasen Chen (Kansai University of International Studies, Japan)\n\nSummary: In the higher education, internet and mobile device are often used for language and ICT education and so on. In the special session, we are studying the possibilities and problems of using e-learning and smart devices in higher education based on the statistics data and questioners survey.\n\nIn addition, we are thinking about how to educate to solute the problems when we use a smart device in higher educations. Particularly, we are thinking about how we should teach information security morals to university students and will point to several universities in Japan as examples.\n\nDSIR-WSS4: Learning Analytics and Institutional Research in Healthcare Professional Education during COVID-19\n\nOrganizer: Yoshikazu Asada (Jichi Medical University, Japan)\n\nSummary: Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have replaced face-to-face lectures with hybrid and/or online learning. In healthcare professional education, in addition to lectures, clinical clerkships are also considered important. Thus, both learning management systems such as Moodle for asynchronous education and web conferencing systems such as Zoom for synchronous education were found necessary.\n\nAlong with the shift to the online delivery of lectures and clinical clerkships, many learning logs were recorded and stored in the systems. These learning records are available for both learning analytics and institutional research.\n\nSome universities had incorporated online learning mechanisms on a few occasions before the pandemic. As a result, the analysis of records and the evaluation of the effectiveness of online learning have important implications both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe need for online learning has also been increasing in different fields of healthcare, especially at the post-graduate level, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn this special session, we would like to present online learning practices that were adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare professional education. We discuss (1) the findings from extant practice, especially in the areas of learning analytics and institutional research, and (2) what these practices remained for the education of after the corona era.\n\nDSIR-WSS5: Graduation Rate: A Crucial Indicator of Accountability at College\n\nOrganizers: Faxian Yang (University of South Carolina, USA), Yangzi Mao(University of South Carolina, USA), Minghui Wang (Stevens Institute of Technology, USA)\n\nSummary: As obtaining a college education is more readily available now with so many choices of universities, students, parents, and the academic community have started to question the quality of higher education for many reasons. The accountability of each college becomes more and more important, not only for the college’s accreditation, but also for their reputation and commitment to the students, parents, and community they serve. Usually, graduation rate is one of the key performance indicators of a college’s accountability. This is because college education not only helps elevate students’ socioeconomic status, but also prepares more young people to get college degrees, enter the labor force, and contribute to the economic development in the society.\n\nAs published in the OECD Education at a Glance 2020: OECD Indicators, based on the 2018 patterns of graduation, it is estimated that 41% of young adults will graduate from tertiary education for the first time in their life before the age of 30 on average across the OECD countries. The proportion ranges from 10% in Luxembourg to 71% in Japan (OECD, 2020, p.216). The OECD average graduation rate is 41%. The top five OECD countries with the highest college first-time graduation rates were Japan, Australia, Spain, Lithuania, and New Zealand. In 2016, 56% of first-time college students graduated in the United States. There are large gaps in graduation patterns at the college level across OECD countries. Factors that impact students’ college graduation rates greatly vary given each country’s own history, culture, value of education and economic development. In the United States, besides their socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, college preparation and academic performance in the first two years of college are the more important factors that influence students’ academic success. Historical tradition and value of education in East Asian countries may be the reasons why those countries tend to have higher graduation rates as exemplified in Japan.\n\nIn American colleges and universities, student counseling services, academic departments, as well as administrative offices like the Office of Financial Aid and the Registrar’s Office have attempted to support their students and improve their graduation rates. These intervention efforts would not be effective without the analytical support offered by institutional researchers. The Office of Institutional Research plays unique role in supporting the students’ success by collecting and analyzing multiple aspects of student data. Logistic regression analysis is often used to study the factors that impact student graduation rate. For example, the session will also share a case study conducted in an American research university by utilizing the confusion matrix in logic regression analysis to identify the “at-risk” students who were predicted not to graduate and offer suggestions how to help these students get their diplomas.\n\nThis special session will aim to open a platform for IR colleagues from different cultural and academic backgrounds to share and discuss their studies or experiences of improving college graduation rates.\n\nReference: OECD (2020), Education at a Glance 2020: OECD Indicators, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/69096873-en.\n\nDSIR-WSS6: Institutional Research for Learning and Teaching under the COVID-19 Situation\n\nOrganizer: Keita Nishiyama (Senshu University, Japan)\n\nSummary: Last year, the educational activity drastically changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all classes had not to face-to-face but online delivery of lectures. On the other hand, the institutional researcher has to change to a new approach and prospects to analyze educational data such as verification for online lectures, learning analytics of learning logs. This special session will be discussed and presented about case studies and prospects for the learning and teaching after the COVID-19 situation. For example,\n\n(1) The entrance exam under the COVID-19\n\n(2) The teaching under the COVID-19\n\n(3) The learning under the COVID-19\n\n(4) The Questionnaires Survey under the COVID-19\n\n(5) The Data Analysis under the COVID-19\n\n(6) The Career Education under the COVID-19\n\nAnd any theme.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastic changes to the university environment. However, this thing is chance. The online lectures and the face-to-face lectures will co-exist for the future. The organizers look forward to many good submissions for education improvement.\n\nDSIR-WSS7: Institutional Research in universities to encourage students to qualify for the national examination\n\nOrganizers: Yasuo Nakata (Kobe Tokiwa University, Japan), Kenjiro Sakaki (Tenshi College, Japan)\n\nSummary: In 2012, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) proposed the establishment of Institutional Research (IR) in Japanese universities. Most universities have since launched this department. One of the objectives of the IR department is to reform the education system in order to advance higher education. Universities can be classified into two categories. The first type is designed to enable students to qualify for the national examination. The second type includes the universities excluding those under the first type. We can refer to the former as a national license-type university. MEXT promotes higher education reforms in universities. However, the curriculum of the national license-type university has to conform with the rules in order to obtain a qualification for the national examination from the corresponding ministry. Hence, there should be a difference between the IR in a license-type university and a non-license-type university. We will discuss the differences and similarities between the IR in license and non-license-type universities.\n\nSCAI 2021 Special Sessions\n\nSCAI-WSS1: Hybrid Intelligent Systems and Software Functions\n\nOrganizers: Masashi Kawaguchi (National Institute of Technology, Japan) and Chihiro Ikuta (Suzuka College, Japan)\n\nSummary: Hybrid intelligent systems and software functions includes recent optimized combined methods and integrated technologies as neural networks, learning, artificial intelligence, intelligent information technologies and wide network technologies. Recent hybrid intelligent systems are rapidly developing in all areas of our social life and technology societies. Deep learning is a well-known topic of information technologies, which is based on the biological and artificial neural networks. But, further intelligent and superior abilities are expected in these neural networks. To develop further these technologies, the integrated hybrid technologies and systems are expected, which will combine the logical, reasoning and explainable technologies to the neural networks. Hybrid intelligent systems and software functions include Neural system, Neural-reasoning computing, Hybrid connectionist systems, Genetic evolutionary systems, Deep learning systems, Intelligent learning systems, Reinforcement learning systems, Fundamental intelligent software technologies, Intelligent network technologies and Security based networks.\n\nHybrid intelligent technologies will be a common base for the realization of the advanced society and its life. In this session, we take and discuss these topics related to the hybrid intelligent systems and their software functions. Papers related to these topics are welcome for the presentation in this session.\n\nSCAI-WSS2: Digital Innovation and Sustainable Society\n\nOrganizer: Hidehiko Hayashi (Hokusei Gakuen University, Japan)\n\nSummary: In recent years on the sustainable service-based view, there has been progress in developing smart and high-end information technologies based on intelligence infrastructure. It has been used widely in various areas like industry, education, medical information, and intelligence system. There are a few key elements of IT (Information Technology) systems for sustainable service in the knowledge-based society. Systems with sustainable progressive technologies have been discussed for all future generations. In this session, we focus on digital innovation and sustainable society.

We discuss issues related to human resources management and communications management in projects in Thailand, Vietnam and Japan, as well as strategies for resolving them.\n\nEAIS-WSS3: Improvement, Innovation and Change in Business and Socciety\n\nOrganizer: Hideto Ogasawara (Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan)\n\nSummary: Modern society is facing many challenges. Many problems, such as declining birthrate and aging population, social fragmentation, growing disparities, employment, security, disaster prevention, climate change, pandemics, diplomacy and defense are all interrelated and difficult to solve. Furthermore, the accelerating globalization and the rapid development of digital and other technologies are making it difficult to predict our future.\n\nWe are living in the midst of a “VUCA” era, where change is rapid and unpredictable. “VUCA” is an acronym that stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity.\n\nIn these times, three perspectives are important: improvement, innovation, and change. First of all, we need to build on improvement activities to make the present better and lead to innovation. And, what is needed to transform society in a desirable direction is the ability to be flexible in the face of change, to recognize complex events, to accept diverse values, and to have a holistic outlook and to be able to explain everything at a glance. Then it is necessary to set appropriate desired values and to realize them.\n\nThese are the concepts of “program management.” To consider and discuss such social change and program management will be of great significance for the future of business and society.\n\nIn this session, we would like to discuss with the participants how we can contribute to better and sustainable future with this theme.\n\nIDDC 2021 Special Sessions\n\nIDDC-WSS1: Bible Media Informatics\n\nOrganizer: Takayuki Fujimoto (Toyo University, Japan)\n\nSummary: “Bible Media Informatics” focuses on practices, technologies, applications and theories for Bible and Informatics, Bible and Media, including Smartphone Apps for Christianity and so onThe session offers a multi-disciplinary approach to Bible Media and Informatics. The session offers a multi-disciplinary approach to Bible Media and Informatics.\n\nIDDC-WSS2: Analog on Digital\n\nOrganizer: Ziran Fan (Toyo University, Japan)\n\nSummary: Special Session of “Analog on Digital” aims to explore the new possibility in the fields of interaction design and digital creation / computing. Analog on Digital refers to ideas and theories of using or controlling the various digitized tools through analog- like methods by merging analog and digital. In this session, we will discuss the modalities of current digitization and papers regarding the above fields are cordially invited.\n\nDSTM 2021 Special Sessions\n\nDSTM-WSS1: Applications of Optimization and Decision Making\n\nOrganizer: Takayuki Shiina (Waseda University, Japan)\n\nSummary: Mathematical programming has been applied to various fields in everyday life. However, for many actual problems, the assumption that the parameters involved in the problem are deterministic known data is often unjustified. These data contain uncertainty and are thus represented as random variables, since they represent information about the future. In this session, we consider a mathematical programming problem in which some parameters are uncertain.\n\nDecision-making under conditions of uncertainty involves potential risk. For example, setting up too few new plants in the supply chain, may result in a shortage of capacity for future demand. On the other hand, excessive investment will cause an excess of capacity. Our problem is thus a strategic decision problem under uncertainty, and can be viewed as a stochastic programming problem. Some applications of stochastic planning to real problems are shown in this session.\n\nDSTM-WSS2: Decision Analysis in Human Activities\n\nOrganizer: Husam bukhary (Tokai University, Japan), Tomoaki Tabata, (Tokai University, Japan)\n\nSummary: This session will provide an introduction to research on decision analysis in human activities such as business and personal. In particular, we will discuss practical topics in the above areas, utilizing several statistical methods and several decision making theories."
