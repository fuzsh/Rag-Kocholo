        "meta_description": "Abstract. To mitigate the human impact on climate change, it is essential to determine the\ncontribution of emissions to the concentration of trace gases. In particular,\nthe source attribution of short-lived species such as OH and HO2 is\nimportant as they play a crucial role for atmospheric chemistry. This study\npresents an advanced version of a tagging method for OH and HO2\n(HOx) which attributes HOx concentrations to emissions.\nWhile the former version (V1.0) only considered 12 reactions in the\ntroposphere, the new version (V1.1), presented here, takes 19 reactions in the\ntroposphere into account. For the first time, the main chemical\nreactions for the HOx chemistry in the stratosphere are also regarded\n(in total 27 reactions). To fully take into account the main HO2\nsource by the reaction of H and O2, the tagging of the H radical is\nintroduced. In order to ensure the steady-state assumption, we introduce rest\nterms which balance the deviation of HOx production and loss. This\ncloses the budget between the sum of all contributions and the total\nconcentration. The contributions to OH and HO2 obtained by the\nadvanced tagging method V1.1 deviate from V1.0 in certain source categories.\nFor OH, major changes are found in the categories biomass burning, biogenic\nemissions and methane decomposition. For HO2, the contributions\ndiffer strongly in the categories biogenic emissions and methane\ndecomposition. As HOx reacts with ozone (O3), carbon\nmonoxide (CO), reactive nitrogen compounds (NOy), non-methane\nhydrocarbons (NMHCs) and peroxyacyl nitrates (PAN), the contributions to these\nspecies are also modified by the advanced HOx tagging method V1.1.\nThe contributions to NOy, NMHC and PAN show only little change,\nwhereas O3 from biogenic emissions and methane decomposition\nincreases in the tropical troposphere. Variations for CO from biogenic\nemissions and biomass burning are only found in the Southern Hemisphere.",

Our results indicate a contribution to ground-level ozone from land transport emissions of up to 18 % in North America and Southern Europe as well as a contribution from shipping emissions of up to 30 % in the Pacific. Our estimates of the radiative ozone forcing due to land transport and shipping emissions are 92 mW m−2 and 62 mW m−2, respectively.\n\nAirborne in-situ quantification of methane emissions from oil and gas production in Romania\n\nHossein Maazallahi, Foteini Stavropoulou, Samuel Jonson Sutanto, Michael Steiner, Dominik Brunner, Mariano Mertens, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Antoon Visschedijk, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Stijn Dellaert, Nataly Velandia Salinas, Stefan Schwietzke, Daniel Zavala-Araiza, Sorin Ghemulet, Alexandru Pana, Magdalena Ardelean, Marius Corbu, Andreea Calcan, Stephen A.

The results from the evaluations performed for this article are independently consistent with the results from previously published article which was based on ground-based measurements during the ROMEO campaign.

The module is included in the AirTraf 3.0 submodel and uses weather conditions simulated by the EMAC atmospheric model. This paper focuses on the ability of SolFinder to identify eco-efficient trajectories, reducing a flight's climate impact at limited cost penalties.\n\nThe contribution of transport emissions to ozone mixing ratios and methane lifetime in 2015 and 2050 in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)\n\nMariano Mertens, Sabine Brinkop, Phoebe Graf, Volker Grewe, Johannes Hendricks, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Anna Lanteri, Sigrun Matthes, Vanessa S.

Chem. Phys., 24, 1743–1775, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1743-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1743-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVery fast aircraft can travel at 30–40 km altitude and are designed to use liquid hydrogen as fuel instead of kerosene. Depending on their flight altitude, the impact of these aircraft on the atmosphere and climate can change very much. Our results show that a variation inflight latitude can have a considerably higher change in impact compared to a variation in flight altitude. Atmospheric air transport and polar stratospheric clouds play an important role in hypersonic aircraft emissions.\n\nUpdated algorithmic climate change functions (aCCF) V1.0A: Evaluation with the climate-response model AirClim V2.0\n\nSigrun Matthes, Simone DietmÃ¼ller, Katrin Dahlmann, Christine FrÃ¶mming, Patrick Peter, Hiroshi Yamashita, Volker Grewe, Feijia Yin, and Federica Castino\n\nGeosci.

Such routing strategies requires a dedicated meteorological service in order to inform on regions of the atmosphere where aviation non-CO2 emissions have a large climate effect, e.g. by contrail formation or nitrogen-oxide (NOx)-induced ozone formation. This study presents calibration factors for individual non-CO2 effects by comparing with the climate response model AirClim.\n\nDifferences in microphysical properties of cirrus at high and mid-latitudes\n\nElena De La Torre Castro, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Armin Afchine, Volker Grewe, Valerian Hahn, Simon Kirschler, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Johannes Lucke, Nicole Spelten, Heini Wernli, Martin ZÃ¶ger, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos.

The in situ measurements are combined with backward trajectories to investigate the influence of the region on cloud formation. We show that HL cirrus are characterized by a lower concentration of larger ice crystals when compared to ML cirrus.\n\nA Python library for computing individual and merged non-CO2 algorithmic climate change functions: CLIMaCCF V1.0\n\nSimone DietmÃ¼ller, Sigrun Matthes, Katrin Dahlmann, Hiroshi Yamashita, Abolfazl Simorgh, Manuel Soler, Florian Linke, Benjamin LÃ¼hrs, Maximilian M.

This requires spatially and temporally resolved information on aviation's climate impact. We propose using algorithmic climate change functions (aCCFs) for CO2 and non-CO2 effects (ozone, methane, water vapor, contrail cirrus). Merged aCCFs combine individual aCCFs by assuming aircraft-specific parameters and climate metrics. Technically this is done with a Python library.\n\nRobust 4D climate-optimal flight planning in structured airspace using parallelized simulation on GPUs: ROOST V1.0\n\nAbolfazl Simorgh, Manuel Soler, Daniel GonzÃ¡lez-Arribas, Florian Linke, Benjamin LÃ¼hrs, Maximilian M.

Based on the optimization methodology, a Python library has been developed, which can be accessed using the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7121862. The developed tool is capable of providing robust trajectories taking into account all probable realizations of meteorological conditions provided by an EPS computationally very fast.\n\nOzone source attribution in polluted European areas during summer as simulated with MECO(n)\n\nMarkus Kilian, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Astrid Kerkweg, Mariano Mertens, Andreas Zahn, and Helmut Ziereis\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-528,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-528, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic emissions are a major source of precursors for tropospheric ozone formation. As ozone formation is highly non-linear, we apply a global-regional chemistry-climate model with a source attribution method (tagging) to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic emissions to ozone. We focus on two major polluted areas in Europe, the Po Valley and the Benelux region. Our analysis shows that in particular anthropogenic emissions from Europe contribute largely to ground-level ozone.\n\nThe CO2 and non-CO2 climate effects of individual flights: simplified estimation of CO2 equivalent emission factors\n\nRobin N.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-126,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-126, 2023\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a simplied method to estimate the climate effects of single flights through CO2 and non-CO2 effects, exclusively based on the aircraft seat category as well as the origin and destination airports. The derived climate effect functions exhibit a mean relative error of only 15 % with respect to results from a climate response model. The method is designed for climate footprint assessments and covers most commerical airlines with seat capacities starting from 101 passengers.\n\nPredicting the climate impact of aviation for en-route emissions: the algorithmic climate change function submodel ACCF 1.0 of EMAC 2.53\n\nFeijia Yin, Volker Grewe, Federica Castino, Pratik Rao, Sigrun Matthes, Katrin Dahlmann, Simone DietmÃ¼ller, Christine FrÃ¶mming, Hiroshi Yamashita, Patrick Peter, Emma Klingaman, Keith P. Shine, Benjamin LÃ¼hrs, and Florian Linke\n\nGeosci.

The ACCF V1.0 is based on the prototype algorithmic climate change functions (aCCFs) v1.0 to enable climate-optimized flight trajectories. One highlight of this paper is that we describe a consistent full set of aCCFs formulas with respect to fuel scenario and metrics. We demonstrate the usage of the ACCF submodel using AirTraf V2.0 to optimize trajectories for cost and climate impact.\n\nAn inconsistency in aviation emissions between CMIP5 and CMIP6 and the implications for short-lived species and their radiative forcing\n\nRobin N. Thor, Mariano Mertens, Sigrun Matthes, Mattia Righi, Johannes Hendricks, Sabine Brinkop, Phoebe Graf, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Steven Smith\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1459–1466, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1459-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1459-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report on an inconsistency in the latitudinal distribution of aviation emissions between two versions of a data product which is widely used by researchers. From the available documentation, we do not expect such an inconsistency. We run a chemistry–climate model to compute the effect of the inconsistency in emissions on atmospheric chemistry and radiation and find that the radiative forcing associated with aviation ozone is 7.6 % higher when using the less recent version of the data.\n\nThe climate impact of hydrogen-powered hypersonic transport\n\nJohannes Pletzer, Didier Hauglustaine, Yann Cohen, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Volker Grewe\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14323–14354, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14323-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14323-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVery fast aircraft can travel long distances in extremely short times and can fly at high altitudes (15 to 35 km). These aircraft emit water vapour, nitrogen oxides, and hydrogen. Water vapour emissions remain for months to several years at these altitudes and have an important impact on temperature. We investigate two aircraft fleets flying at 26 and 35 km. Ozone is depleted more, and the water vapour perturbation and temperature change are larger for the aircraft flying at 35 km.\n\nTransport patterns of global aviation NOx and their short-term O3 radiative forcing â a machine learning approach\n\nJin Maruhashi, Volker Grewe, Christine FrÃ¶mming, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Irene C. Dedoussi\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This study uses global-scale simulations to characterize the transport patterns between NOx emissions at an altitude of ~ 10.4 km and the resulting ozone. Results show a strong spatial and temporal dependence of NOx in disturbing atmospheric O3 concentrations, with the location that is most impacted in terms of warming not necessarily coinciding with the emission region.\n\nTransClim (v1.0): a chemistryâclimate response model for assessing the effect of mitigation strategies for road traffic on ozone\n\nVanessa Simone Rieger and Volker Grewe\n\nGeosci.

We propose a consistent approach for evaluating the simulated vertical distribution of NO2 using MAX-DOAS measurements while also considering its spatial sensitivity volume and change in sensitivity within this volume.\n\nInfluence of weather situation on non-CO2 aviation climate effects: the REACT4C climate change functions\n\nChristine FrÃ¶mming, Volker Grewe, Sabine Brinkop, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Amund S. Haslerud, Simon Rosanka, Jesper van Manen, and Sigrun Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 9151–9172, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9151-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9151-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe influence of weather situations on non-CO2 aviation climate impact is investigated to identify systematic weather-related sensitivities. If aircraft avoid the most sensitive areas, climate impact might be reduced. Enhanced significance is found for emission in relation to high-pressure systems, jet stream, polar night, and tropopause altitude. The results represent a comprehensive data set for studies aiming at weather-dependent flight trajectory optimization to reduce total climate impact.\n\nICON in Climate Limited-area Mode (ICON release version 2.6.1): a new regional climate model\n\nTrang Van Pham, Christian Steger, Burkhardt Rockel, Klaus Keuler, Ingo Kirchner, Mariano Mertens, Daniel Rieger, GÃ¼nther ZÃ¤ngl, and Barbara FrÃ¼h\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 985–1005, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-985-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-985-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new regional climate model was prepared based on a weather forecast model. Slow processes of the climate system such as ocean state development and greenhouse gas emissions were implemented. A model infrastructure and evaluation tools were also prepared to facilitate long-term simulations and model evalution. The first ICON-CLM results were close to observations and comparable to those from COSMO-CLM, the recommended model being used at the Deutscher Wetterdienst and CLM Community.\n\nThe impact of weather patterns and related transport processes on aviation's contribution to ozone and methane concentrations from NOx emissions\n\nSimon Rosanka, Christine FrÃ¶mming, and Volker Grewe\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 12347–12361, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12347-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12347-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAviation-attributed nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions lead to an increase in ozone and a depletion of methane. We investigate the impact of weather-related transport processes on these induced composition changes. Subsidence in high-pressure systems leads to earlier ozone maxima due to an enhanced chemical activity. Background NOx and hydroperoxyl radicals limit the total ozone change during summer and winter, respectively. High water vapour concentrations lead to a high methane depletion.\n\nNewly developed aircraft routing options for air traffic simulation in the chemistryâclimate model EMAC 2.53: AirTraf 2.0\n\nHiroshi Yamashita, Feijia Yin, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Sigrun Matthes, Bastian Kern, Katrin Dahlmann, and Christine FrÃ¶mming\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 4869–4890, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4869-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4869-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes the updated submodel AirTraf 2.0 which simulates global air traffic in the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model. Nine aircraft routing options have been integrated, including contrail avoidance, minimum economic costs, and minimum climate impact. Example simulations reveal characteristics of different routing options on air traffic performances. The consistency of the AirTraf simulations is verified with literature data.\n\nAttributing ozone and its precursors to land transport emissions in Europe and Germany\n\nMariano Mertens, Astrid Kerkweg, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Robert Sausen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7843–7873, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7843-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7843-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the contribution of land transport emissions to ozone and ozone precursors in Europe and Germany. Our results show that land transport emissions are one of the most important contributors to reactive nitrogen in Europe. The contribution to ozone is in the range of 8 % to 16 % and varies strongly for different seasons. The hots-pots with the largest ozone concentrations are the Po Valley, while the largest concentration to reactive nitrogen is located mainly in western Europe.\n\nHindcasting and forecasting of regional methane from coal mine emissions in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin using the online nested global regional chemistryâclimate model MECO(n) (MESSy v2.53)\n\nAnna-Leah Nickl, Mariano Mertens, Anke Roiger, Andreas Fix, Axel Amediek, Alina Fiehn, Christoph Gerbig, Michal Galkowski, Astrid Kerkweg, Theresa Klausner, Maximilian Eckl, and Patrick JÃ¶ckel\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1925–1943, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1925-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1925-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on the global and regional chemistry–climate model system MECO(n), we implemented a forecast system to support the planning of measurement campaign research flights with chemical weather forecasts. We applied this system for the first time to provide 6 d forecasts in support of the CoMet 1.0 campaign targeting methane emitted from coal mining ventilation shafts in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin in Poland. We describe the new forecast system and evaluate its forecast skill.\n\nAre contributions of emissions to ozone a matter of scale? â a study using MECO(n) (MESSy v2.50)\n\nMariano Mertens, Astrid Kerkweg, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Robert Sausen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 363–383, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-363-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-363-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates if ozone source apportionment results using a tagged tracer approach depend on the resolutions of the applied model and/or emission inventory. For this we apply a global to regional atmospheric chemistry model, which allows us to compare the results on global and regional scales. Our results show that differences on the continental scale (e.g. Europe) are rather small (10 %); on the regional scale, however, differences of up to 30 % were found.\n\nDynamics and composition of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone\n\nKlaus-Dirk Gottschaldt, Hans Schlager, Robert Baumann, Duy Sinh Cai, Veronika Eyring, Phoebe Graf, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Christiane Voigt, Andreas Zahn, and Helmut Ziereis\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 5655–5675, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5655-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5655-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study places aircraft trace gas measurements from within the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone into the context of regional, intra- and interannual variability. We find that the processes reflected in the measurements are present throughout multiple simulated monsoon seasons. Dynamical instabilities, photochemical ozone production, lightning and entrainments from the lower troposphere and from the tropopause region determine the distinct composition of the anticyclone and its outflow.\n\nRevisiting the contribution of land transport and shipping emissions to tropospheric ozone\n\nMariano Mertens, Volker Grewe, Vanessa S. Rieger, and Patrick JÃ¶ckel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 5567–5588, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5567-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5567-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantified the contribution of land transport and shipping emissions to tropospheric ozone using a global chemistry–climate model. Our results indicate a contribution to ground-level ozone from land transport emissions of up to 18 % in North America and Southern Europe as well as a contribution from shipping emissions of up to 30 % in the Pacific. Our estimates of the radiative ozone forcing due to land transport and shipping emissions are 92 mW m−2 and 62 mW m−2, respectively.\n\nThe on-line coupled atmospheric chemistry model system MECO(n) â Part 5: Expanding the Multi-Model-Driver (MMD v2.0) for 2-way data exchange including data interpolation via GRID (v1.0)\n\nAstrid Kerkweg, Christiane Hofmann, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Mariano Mertens, and Gregor Pante\n\nGeosci.

For the first time, it takes into account chemically competing effects, e.g., the competition between ozone precursors in the production of ozone. We show that the results are in-line with results from other tagging schemes and provide plausibility checks for OH and HO2, which have not previously been tagged.\n\nThe 1-way on-line coupled model system MECO(n) â PartÂ 4: Chemical evaluation (based on MESSyÂ v2.52)\n\nMariano Mertens, Astrid Kerkweg, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Holger Tost, and Christiane Hofmann\n\nGeosci.

For this, a simulation incorporating two regional instances, one over Europe with 50 km resolution and one over Germany with 12 km resolution, is conducted. The model results are compared with satellite, ground-based and aircraft in situ observations.\n\nAir traffic simulation in chemistry-climate model EMAC 2.41: AirTraf 1.0\n\nHiroshi Yamashita, Volker Grewe, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Florian Linke, Martin Schaefer, and Daisuke Sasaki\n\nGeosci.

AirTraf simulations were demonstrated with great circle and flight time routing options for a specific winter day, assuming an Airbus A330 aircraft. The results confirmed that AirTraf simulates the air traffic properly for the two options. Calculated flight time, fuel consumption and NOx emission index are comparable to reference data.\n\nEarth System Chemistry integrated Modelling (ESCiMo) with the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) versionÂ 2.51\n\nPatrick JÃ¶ckel, Holger Tost, Andrea Pozzer, Markus Kunze, Oliver Kirner, Carl A.

The manuscript documents the model and the various applied model set-ups and provides a first evaluation of the simulation results from a global perspective as a quality check of the data.\n\nDrivers of the tropospheric ozone budget throughout the 21st century under the medium-high climate scenario RCP 6.0\n\nL.

Under RCP 6.0, ozone in the future is governed primarily by changes in nitrogen oxides (NOx). Methane is also important, and induces an increase in tropospheric ozone that is approximately one-third of that caused by NOx. This study highlights the critical role that emission policies globally have to play in determining tropospheric ozone evolution through the 21st century.\n\nAircraft routing with minimal climate impact: the REACT4C climate cost function modelling approach (V1.0)\n\nV.

This research describes a new method of simulating these effects in an idealized, efficient atmospheric model. A volcanic eruption of sulfur dioxide is described with a simplified set of physical rules, which eventually cools the planetary surface. This model has been designed as a test bed for climate attribution studies.\n\nA 3D-Var assimilation scheme for vertical velocity with CMA-MESO v5.0\n\nHong Li, Yi Yang, Jian Sun, Yuan Jiang, Ruhui Gan, and Qian Xie\n\nGeosci.

A three-dimensional variational vertical velocity assimilation scheme is developed within the high-resolution CMA-MESO model, utilizing the adiabatic Richardson equation as the observation operator. A 10 d continuous run and an individual case study demonstrate improved forecasts, confirming the scheme's effectiveness.\n\nUpdating the radiation infrastructure in MESSy (based on MESSy version 2.55)\n\nMatthias NÃ¼tzel, Laura Stecher, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Franziska Winterstein, Martin Dameris, Michael Ponater, Phoebe Graf, and Markus Kunze\n\nGeosci.

After calibrating the model setups to the old and the new radiation scheme, we find that the simulation with the new scheme shows considerable improvements, e.g. concerning the cold-point temperature and stratospheric water vapour. Furthermore, perturbations of radiative fluxes associated with greenhouse gas changes, e.g. of methane, tend to be improved when the new scheme is employed.\n\nAn urban module coupled with the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to improve hydrothermal simulations in urban systems\n\nYibing Wang, Xianhong Xie, Bowen Zhu, Arken Tursun, Fuxiao Jiang, Yao Liu, Dawei Peng, and Buyun Zheng\n\nGeosci.

To address this, we developed an urban module, VIC-urban, in the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Tested in Beijing, VIC-urban accurately simulated turbulent heat fluxes, runoff, and land surface temperature. We provide a reliable tool for large-scale simulations considering urban environment and a systematic urban modelling framework within VIC, offering crucial insights for urban planners and designers.\n\nBayesian hierarchical model for bias-correcting climate models\n\nJeremy Carter, Erick A. ChacÃ³n-MontalvÃ¡n, and Amber Leeson\n\nGeosci.

However, the output is often afflicted with some bias. In this paper, a novel model is developed to predict and correct bias in the output of climate models. The model captures uncertainty in the correction and explicitly models underlying spatial correlation between points. These features are of key importance for climate change impact assessments and resulting decision-making.\n\nEvaluation of the coupling of EMACv2.55 to the land surface and vegetation model JSBACHv4\n\nAnna Martin, Veronika Gayler, Benedikt Steil, Klaus KlingmÃ¼ller, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Holger Tost, Jos Lelieveld, and Andrea Pozzer\n\nGeosci.

JSBACH mitigates earlier problems of soil dryness, which are critical for vegetation modelling. When analysed using different datasets, the coupled model shows strong correlations of key variables, such as land surface temperature, surface albedo and radiation flux. The versatility of the model increases significantly, while the overall performance does not degrade.\n\nReduced floating-point precision in regional climate simulations: an ensemble-based statistical verification\n\nHugo Banderier, Christian Zeman, David Leutwyler, Stefan RÃ¼disÃ¼hli, and Christoph SchÃ¤r\n\nGeosci.

After this time, the results of the reduced precision and the standard implementation are hardly different. This should encourage the use of reduced precision in climate models to exploit the speedup and memory savings it brings. The methodology used in this work can help researchers verify reduced-precision implementations of their model.\n\nTorchClim v1.0: a deep-learning plugin for climate model physics\n\nDavid Fuchs, Steven C.

We present a new software plugin for this integration, TorchClim, that is scalable and flexible and thereby allows a new level of experimentation with the ML approach. We also provide guidance on ML training and demonstrate a skillful hybrid ML atmosphere model.\n\nLinking global terrestrial and ocean biogeochemistry with process-based, coupled freshwater algaeânutrientâsolid dynamics in LM3-FANSY v1.0\n\nMinjin Lee, Charles A.

Such efforts, however, have been challenged by the difficulty of balancing details of freshwater biogeochemical processes with limited knowledge, input, and validation datasets. Here we develop a global freshwater model that resolves intertwined algae, solid, and nutrient dynamics and provide performance assessment against measurement-based estimates.\n\nValidating a microphysical prognostic stratospheric aerosol implementation in E3SMv2 using observations after the Mount Pinatubo eruption\n\nHunter York Brown, Benjamin Wagman, Diana Bull, Kara Peterson, Benjamin Hillman, Xiaohong Liu, Ziming Ke, and Lin Lin\n\nGeosci.

We include and test this process in a global climate model, E3SM. E3SM is tested against satellite and balloon observations of the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, showing that with these particles in the model we reasonably recreate Pinatubo and its global effects. We also explore how particle size leads to these effects.\n\nImplementing detailed nucleation predictions in the Earth system model EC-Earth3.3.4: sulfuric acidâammonia nucleation\n\nCarl Svenhag, Moa K.

With the global model EC-Earth3 we show that using a new method for NPF modeling, which includes new detailed processes with NH3 and H2SO4, significantly impacts the number of particles in the air and clouds and changes the radiation balance of the same magnitude as anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.\n\nModeling biochar effects on soil organic carbon on croplands in a microbial decomposition model (MIMICS-BC_v1.0)\n\nMengjie Han, Qing Zhao, Xili Wang, Ying-Ping Wang, Philippe Ciais, Haicheng Zhang, Daniel S.

Model Dev., 17, 4871–4890, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4871-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4871-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of biochar (BC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics is not represented in most land carbon models used for assessing land-based climate change mitigation. Our study develops a BC model that incorporates our current understanding of BC effects on SOC based on a soil carbon model (MIMICS). The BC model can reproduce the SOC changes after adding BC, providing a useful tool to couple dynamic land models to evaluate the effectiveness of BC application for CO2 removal from the atmosphere.\n\nHector V3.2.0: functionality and performance of a reduced-complexity climate model\n\nKalyn Dorheim, Skylar Gering, Robert Gieseke, Corinne Hartin, Leeya Pressburger, Alexey N. Shiklomanov, Steven J. Smith, Claudia Tebaldi, Dawn L. Woodard, and Ben Bond-Lamberty\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4855–4869, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4855-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4855-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHector is an easy-to-use, global climate–carbon cycle model. With its quick run time, Hector can provide climate information from a run in a fraction of a second. Hector models on a global and annual basis. Here, we present an updated version of the model, Hector V3. In this paper, we document Hector’s new features. Hector V3 is capable of reproducing historical observations, and its future temperature projections are consistent with those of more complex models.\n\nEvaluation of CMIP6 model simulations of PM2.5 and its components over China\n\nFangxuan Ren, Jintai Lin, Chenghao Xu, Jamiu A. Adeniran, Jingxu Wang, Randall V. Martin, Aaron van Donkelaar, Melanie S. Hammer, Larry W. Horowitz, Steven T. Turnock, Naga Oshima, Jie Zhang, Susanne Bauer, Kostas Tsigaridis, Ãyvind Seland, Pierre Nabat, David Neubauer, Gary Strand, Twan van Noije, Philippe Le Sager, and Toshihiko Takemura\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4821–4836, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4821-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4821-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate the performance of 14 CMIP6 ESMs in simulating total PM2.5 and its 5 components over China during 2000–2014. PM2.5 and its components are underestimated in almost all models, except that black carbon (BC) and sulfate are overestimated in two models, respectively. The underestimation is the largest for organic carbon (OC) and the smallest for BC. Models reproduce the observed spatial pattern for OC, sulfate, nitrate and ammonium well, yet the agreement is poorer for BC.\n\nAssessment of a tiling energy budget approach in a land surface model, ORCHIDEE-MICT (r8205)\n\nYi Xi, Chunjing Qiu, Yuan Zhang, Dan Zhu, Shushi Peng, Gustaf Hugelius, Jinfeng Chang, Elodie Salmon, and Philippe Ciais\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4727–4754, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4727-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4727-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ORCHIDEE-MICT model can simulate the carbon cycle and hydrology at a sub-grid scale but energy budgets only at a grid scale. This paper assessed the implementation of a multi-tiling energy budget approach in ORCHIDEE-MICT and found warmer surface and soil temperatures, higher soil moisture, and more soil organic carbon across the Northern Hemisphere compared with the original version.\n\nMultivariate adjustment of drizzle bias using machine learning in European climate projections\n\nGeorgia Lazoglou, Theo Economou, Christina Anagnostopoulou, George Zittis, Anna Tzyrkalli, Pantelis Georgiades, and Jos Lelieveld\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4689–4703, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4689-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4689-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study focuses on the important issue of the drizzle bias effect in regional climate models, described by an over-prediction of the number of rainy days while underestimating associated precipitation amounts. For this purpose, two distinct methodologies are applied and rigorously evaluated. These results are encouraging for using the multivariate machine learning method random forest to increase the accuracy of climate models concerning the projection of the number of wet days.\n\nDevelopment and evaluation of the interactive Model for Air Pollution and Land Ecosystems (iMAPLE) version 1.0\n\nXu Yue, Hao Zhou, Chenguang Tian, Yimian Ma, Yihan Hu, Cheng Gong, Hui Zheng, and Hong Liao\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4621–4642, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4621-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4621-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop the interactive Model for Air Pollution and Land Ecosystems (iMAPLE). The model considers the full coupling between carbon and water cycles, dynamic fire emissions, wetland methane emissions, biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, and trait-based ozone vegetation damage. Evaluations show that iMAPLE is a useful tool for the study of the interactions among climate, chemistry, and ecosystems.\n\nA perspective on the next generation of Earth system model scenarios: towards representative emission pathways (REPs)\n\nMalte Meinshausen, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Kathleen Beyer, Greg Bodeker, Olivier Boucher, Josep G.

Velders, Tokuta Yokohata, Tilo Ziehn, and Zebedee Nicholls\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4533–4559, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4533-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4533-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe scientific community is considering new scenarios to succeed RCPs and SSPs for the next generation of Earth system model runs to project future climate change. To contribute to that effort, we reflect on relevant policy and scientific research questions and suggest categories for representative emission pathways. These categories are tailored to the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal, high-risk outcomes in the absence of further climate policy and worlds “that could have been”.\n\nParallel SnowModel (v1.0): a parallel implementation of a distributed snow-evolution modeling system (SnowModel)\n\nRoss Mower, Ethan D. Gutmann, Glen E. Liston, Jessica Lundquist, and Soren Rasmussen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4135–4154, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4135-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4135-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigher-resolution model simulations are better at capturing winter snowpack changes across space and time. However, increasing resolution also increases the computational requirements. This work provides an overview of changes made to a distributed snow-evolution modeling system (SnowModel) to allow it to leverage high-performance computing resources. Continental simulations that were previously estimated to take 120 d can now be performed in 5 h.\n\nLB-SCAM: a learning-based method for efficient large-scale sensitivity analysis and tuning of the Single Column Atmosphere Model (SCAM)\n\nJiaxu Guo, Juepeng Zheng, Yidan Xu, Haohuan Fu, Wei Xue, Lanning Wang, Lin Gan, Ping Gao, Wubing Wan, Xianwei Wu, Zhitao Zhang, Liang Hu, Gaochao Xu, and Xilong Che\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3975–3992, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3975-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3975-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo enhance the efficiency of experiments using SCAM, we train a learning-based surrogate model to facilitate large-scale sensitivity analysis and tuning of combinations of multiple parameters. Employing a hybrid method, we investigate the joint sensitivity of multi-parameter combinations across typical cases, identifying the most sensitive three-parameter combination out of 11. Subsequently, we conduct a tuning process aimed at reducing output errors in these cases.\n\nQuantifying the impact of SST feedback frequency on MaddenâJulian oscillation simulations\n\nYung-Yao Lan, Huang-Hsiung Hsu, and Wan-Ling Tseng\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3897–3918, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3897-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3897-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses the CAM5–SIT coupled model to investigate the effects of SST feedback frequency on the MJO simulations with intervals at 30 min, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 d. The simulations become increasingly unrealistic as the frequency of the SST feedback decreases. Our results suggest that more spontaneous air--sea interaction (e.g., ocean response within 3 d in this study) with high vertical resolution in the ocean model is key to the realistic simulation of the MJO.\n\nSystematic and objective evaluation of Earth system models: PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP) version 3\n\nJiwoo Lee, Peter J. Gleckler, Min-Seop Ahn, Ana Ordonez, Paul A. Ullrich, Kenneth R. Sperber, Karl E. Taylor, Yann Y. Planton, Eric Guilyardi, Paul Durack, Celine Bonfils, Mark D. Zelinka, Li-Wei Chao, Bo Dong, Charles Doutriaux, Chengzhu Zhang, Tom Vo, Jason Boutte, Michael F. Wehner, Angeline G. Pendergrass, Daehyun Kim, Zeyu Xue, Andrew T. Wittenberg, and John Krasting\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3919–3948, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3919-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3919-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce an open-source software, the PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP), developed for a comprehensive comparison of Earth system models (ESMs) with real-world observations. Using diverse metrics evaluating climatology, variability, and extremes simulated in thousands of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), PMP aids in benchmarking model improvements across generations. PMP also enables efficient tracking of performance evolutions during ESM developments.\n\nA revised model of global silicate weathering considering the influence of vegetation cover on erosion rate\n\nHaoyue Zuo, Yonggang Liu, Gaojun Li, Zhifang Xu, Liang Zhao, Zhengtang Guo, and Yongyun Hu\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3949–3974, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3949-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3949-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCompared to the silicate weathering fluxes measured at large river basins, the current models tend to systematically overestimate the fluxes over the tropical region, which leads to an overestimation of the global total weathering flux. The most possible cause of such bias is found to be the overestimation of tropical surface erosion, which indicates that the tropical vegetation likely slows down physical erosion significantly. We propose a way of taking this effect into account in models.\n\nA radiativeâconvective model computing precipitation with the maximum entropy production hypothesis\n\nQuentin Pikeroen, Didier Paillard, and Karine Watrin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3801–3814, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3801-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3801-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAll accurate climate models use equations with poorly defined parameters, where knobs for the parameters are turned to fit the observations. This process is called tuning. In this article, we use another paradigm. We use a thermodynamic hypothesis, the maximum entropy production, to compute temperatures, energy fluxes, and precipitation, where tuning is impossible. For now, the 1D vertical model is used for a tropical atmosphere. The correct order of magnitude of precipitation is computed.\n\nLeveraging regional mesh refinement to simulate future climate projections for California using the Simplified Convection-Permitting E3SM Atmosphere Model Version 0\n\nJishi Zhang, Peter Bogenschutz, Qi Tang, Philip Cameron-smith, and Chengzhu Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3687–3731, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3687-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3687-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a regionally refined climate model that allows resolved convection and performed a 20-year projection to the end of the century. The model has a resolution of 3.25 km in California, which allows us to predict climate with unprecedented accuracy, and a resolution of 100 km for the rest of the globe to achieve efficient, self-consistent simulations. The model produces superior results in reproducing climate patterns over California that typical modern climate models cannot resolve.\n\nMachine learning parameterization of the multi-scale KainâFritsch (MSKF) convection scheme and stable simulation coupled in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using WRFâML v1.0\n\nXiaohui Zhong, Xing Yu, and Hao Li\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3667–3685, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3667-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3667-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn order to forecast localized warm-sector rainfall in the south China region, numerical weather prediction models are being run with finer grid spacing. The conventional convection parameterization (CP) performs poorly in the gray zone, necessitating the development of a scale-aware scheme. We propose a machine learning (ML) model to replace the scale-aware CP scheme. Evaluation against the original CP scheme has shown that the ML-based CP scheme can provide accurate and reliable predictions.\n\nImpacts of spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic aerosol emissions in a regionally refined global aerosolâclimate model\n\nTaufiq Hassan, Kai Zhang, Jianfeng Li, Balwinder Singh, Shixuan Zhang, Hailong Wang, and Po-Lun Ma\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3507–3532, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3507-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3507-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic aerosol emissions are an essential part of global aerosol models. Significant errors can exist from the loss of emission heterogeneity. We introduced an emission treatment that significantly improved aerosol emission heterogeneity in high-resolution model simulations, with improvements in simulated aerosol surface concentrations. The emission treatment will provide a more accurate representation of aerosol emissions and their effects on climate.\n\ncfr (v2024.1.26): a Python package for climate field reconstruction\n\nFeng Zhu, Julien Emile-Geay, Gregory J. Hakim, Dominique Guillot, Deborah Khider, Robert Tardif, and Walter A. Perkins\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3409–3431, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3409-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3409-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate field reconstruction encompasses methods that estimate the evolution of climate in space and time based on natural archives. It is useful to investigate climate variations and validate climate models, but its implementation and use can be difficult for non-experts. This paper introduces a user-friendly Python package called cfr to make these methods more accessible, thanks to the computational and visualization tools that facilitate efficient and reproducible research on past climates.\n\nNEWTS1.0: Numerical model of coastal Erosion by Waves and Transgressive Scarps\n\nRose V. Palermo, J. Taylor Perron, Jason M. Soderblom, Samuel P. D. Birch, Alexander G. Hayes, and Andrew D. Ashton\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3433–3445, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3433-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3433-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModels of rocky coastal erosion help us understand the controls on coastal morphology and evolution. In this paper, we present a simplified model of coastline erosion driven by either uniform erosion where coastline erosion is constant or wave-driven erosion where coastline erosion is a function of the wave power. This model can be used to evaluate how coastline changes reflect climate, sea-level history, material properties, and the relative influence of different erosional processes.\n\nEvaluation of isoprene emissions from the coupled model SURFEXâMEGANv2.1\n\nSafae Oumami, Joaquim Arteta, Vincent Guidard, Pierre Tulet, and Paul David Hamer\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3385–3408, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3385-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3385-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we coupled the SURFEX and MEGAN models. The aim of this coupling is to improve the estimation of biogenic fluxes by using the SURFEX canopy environment model. The coupled model results were validated and several sensitivity tests were performed. The coupled-model total annual isoprene flux is 442 Tg; this value is within the range of other isoprene estimates reported. The ultimate aim of this coupling is to predict the impact of climate change on biogenic emissions.\n\nA comprehensive Earth system model (AWI-ESM2.1) with interactive icebergs: effects on surface and deep-ocean characteristics\n\nLars Ackermann, Thomas Rackow, Kai Himstedt, Paul Gierz, Gregor Knorr, and Gerrit Lohmann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3279–3301, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3279-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3279-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present long-term simulations with interactive icebergs in the Southern Ocean. By melting, icebergs reduce the temperature and salinity of the surrounding ocean. In our simulations, we find that this cooling effect of iceberg melting is not limited to the surface ocean but also reaches the deep ocean and propagates northward into all ocean basins. Additionally, the formation of deep-water masses in the Southern Ocean is enhanced.\n\nThe regional climateâchemistryâecology coupling model RegCM-Chem (v4.6)âYIBs (v1.0): development and application\n\nNanhong Xie, Tijian Wang, Xiaodong Xie, Xu Yue, Filippo Giorgi, Qian Zhang, Danyang Ma, Rong Song, Beiyao Xu, Shu Li, Bingliang Zhuang, Mengmeng Li, Min Xie, Natalya Andreeva Kilifarska, Georgi Gadzhev, and Reneta Dimitrova\n\nGeosci.

We applied it to simulate climatic, chemical, and ecological parameters in East Asia and fully validated it on a variety of observational data. Results show that RegCM-Chem–YIBs model is a valuable tool for studying the terrestrial carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change on a regional scale.\n\nAn overview of cloudâradiation denial experiments for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1\n\nBryce E.

These experiments include both those that test the mean impact of cloud radiative heating and those examining its covariance with circulations. This paper documents the code changes and steps needed to run these experiments. Results corroborate prior findings for how cloud radiative heating impacts circulations and rainfall patterns.\n\nThe computational and energy cost of simulation and storage for climate science: lessons from CMIP6\n\nMario C.

Model Dev., 17, 3081–3098, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a collection of performance metrics gathered during the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), a worldwide initiative to study climate change. We analyse the metrics that resulted from collaboration efforts among many partners and models and describe our findings to demonstrate the utility of our study for the scientific community. The research contributes to understanding climate modelling performance on the current high-performance computing (HPC) architectures.\n\nSubgrid-scale variability of cloud ice in the ICON-AES 1.3.00\n\nSabine Doktorowski, Jan Kretzschmar, Johannes Quaas, Marc Salzmann, and Odran Sourdeval\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3099–3110, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3099-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3099-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEspecially over the midlatitudes, precipitation is mainly formed via the ice phase. In this study we focus on the initial snow formation process in the ICON-AES, the aggregation process. We use a stochastical approach for the aggregation parameterization and investigate the influence in the ICON-AES. Therefore, a distribution function of cloud ice is created, which is evaluated with satellite data. The new approach leads to cloud ice loss and an improvement in the process rate bias.\n\nINFERNO-peat v1.0.0: a representation of northern high-latitude peat fires in the JULES-INFERNO global fire model\n\nKatie R. Blackford, Matthew Kasoar, Chantelle Burton, Eleanor Burke, Iain Colin Prentice, and Apostolos Voulgarakis\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3063–3079, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3063-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3063-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPeatlands are globally important stores of carbon which are being increasingly threatened by wildfires with knock-on effects on the climate system. Here we introduce a novel peat fire parameterization in the northern high latitudes to the INFERNO global fire model. Representing peat fires increases annual burnt area across the high latitudes, alongside improvements in how we capture year-to-year variation in burning and emissions.\n\nThe 4DEnVar-based weakly coupled land data assimilation system for E3SM version 2\n\nPengfei Shi, L. Ruby Leung, Bin Wang, Kai Zhang, Samson M. Hagos, and Shixuan Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3025–3040, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3025-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3025-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImproving climate predictions have profound socio-economic impacts. This study introduces a new weakly coupled land data assimilation (WCLDA) system for a coupled climate model. We demonstrate improved simulation of soil moisture and temperature in many global regions and throughout the soil layers. Furthermore, significant improvements are also found in reproducing the time evolution of the 2012 US Midwest drought. The WCLDA system provides the groundwork for future predictability studies.\n\nContinental-scale bias-corrected climate and hydrological projections for Australia\n\nJustin Peter, Elisabeth Vogel, Wendy Sharples, Ulrike Bende-Michl, Louise Wilson, Pandora Hope, Andrew Dowdy, Greg Kociuba, Sri Srikanthan, Vi Co Duong, Jake Roussis, Vjekoslav Matic, Zaved Khan, Alison Oke, Margot Turner, Stuart Baron-Hay, Fiona Johnson, Raj Mehrotra, Ashish Sharma, Marcus Thatcher, Ali Azarvinand, Steven Thomas, Ghyslaine Boschat, Chantal Donnelly, and Robert Argent\n\nGeosci.

This is important as previous projections for Australia were for small regions and used differing techniques for their projections, making comparisons difficult across Australia's varied climate zones. The data will be beneficial for research purposes and to aid adaptation to climate change.\n\nG6-1.5K-SAI: a new Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) experiment integrating recent advances in solar radiation modification studies\n\nDaniele Visioni, Alan Robock, Jim Haywood, Matthew Henry, Simone Tilmes, Douglas G.

Model Dev., 17, 2547–2567, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2547-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2547-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effects of ozone (O3) stress on crop photosynthesis and leaf senescence were added to maize, rice, soybean, and wheat crop models. The modified models reproduced growth and yields under different O3 levels measured in field experiments and reported in the literature. The combined interactions between O3 and additional stresses were reproduced with the new models. These updated crop models can be used to simulate impacts of O3 stress under future climate change and air pollution scenarios.\n\nA one-dimensional urban flow model with an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme and refined turbulent transport (MLUCM v3.0)\n\nJiachen Lu, Negin Nazarian, Melissa Anne Hart, E. Scott Krayenhoff, and Alberto Martilli\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2525–2545, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2525-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2525-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study enhances urban canopy models by refining key assumptions. Simulations for various urban scenarios indicate discrepancies in turbulent transport efficiency for flow properties. We propose two modifications that involve characterizing diffusion coefficients for momentum and turbulent kinetic energy separately and introducing a physics-based mass-flux term. These adjustments enhance the model's performance, offering more reliable temperature and surface flux estimates.\n\nDCMIP2016: the tropical cyclone test case\n\nJustin L. Willson, Kevin A.

One way this is accomplished is through model intercomparison projects, where results from multiple climate models are analyzed to provide benchmark solutions for the wider climate modeling community. This study describes and analyzes the previously developed TC test case for nine climate models in an intercomparison project, providing solutions that aid in model development.\n\nInteractions between atmospheric composition and climate change â progress in understanding and future opportunities from AerChemMIP, PDRMIP, and RFMIP\n\nStephanie Fiedler, Vaishali Naik, Fiona M.

Thus, climate model experiments are performed and compared. The results of climate model experiments differ, as assessed in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. This article gives insights into the challenges and outlines opportunities for further improving the understanding of climate change. It is based on views of a group of experts in atmospheric composition–climate interactions.\n\nApplying double-cropping and interactive irrigation in the North China Plain using WRF4.5\n\nYuwen Fan, Zhao Yang, Min-Hui Lo, Jina Hur, and Eun-Soon Im\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-38,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-38, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigated agriculture in the North China Plain (NCP) has a significant impact on the local climate. To better understand this impact, we developed a specialized model specifically for the NCP region. This model allows us to simulate the double-cropping vegetation and the dynamic irrigation practices that are commonly employed in the NCP. This model shows improved performance in capturing the general crop growth, such as crop stages, biomass, crop yield, and vegetation greenness.\n\nCD-type discretization for sea ice dynamics in FESOM version 2\n\nSergey Danilov, Carolin Mehlmann, Dmitry Sidorenko, and Qiang Wang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2287–2297, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2287-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2287-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSea ice models are a necessary component of climate models. At very high resolution they are capable of simulating linear kinematic features, such as leads, which are important for better prediction of heat exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Two new discretizations are described which improve the sea ice component of the Finite volumE Sea ice–Ocean Model (FESOM version 2) by allowing simulations of finer scales.\n\nDynamic MJO forecasts using an ensemble subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast system of IAP-CAS model\n\nYangke Liu, Qing Bao, Bian He, Xiaofei Wu, Jing Yang, Yimin Liu, Guoxiong Wu, Tao Zhu, Siyuan Zhou, Yao Tang, Ankang Qu, Yalan Fan, Anling Liu, Dandan Chen, Zhaoming Luo, Xing Hu, and Tongwen Wu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article gives an overview introduction of the IAP-CAS S2S (sub-seasonal to seasonal) ensemble forecasting system and MJO forecast evaluation of the system. Compared to other S2S models, the IAP-CAS model has its advantages but also exhibits some biases, including underdispersive ensemble, overestimated amplitude and faster propagation speed when forecasting MJO. We also provide the explanation towards these biases and prospects for further improvement of this system in the future.\n\nCSDMS Data Components: dataâmodel integration tools for Earth surface processes modeling\n\nTian Gan, Gregory E. Tucker, Eric W. H. Hutton, Mark D. Piper, Irina Overeem, Albert J. Kettner, Benjamin Campforts, Julia M. Moriarty, Brianna Undzis, Ethan Pierce, and Lynn McCready\n\nGeosci.

The case studies demonstrate that the Data Components provide a consistent way to access heterogeneous datasets from multiple sources, and to seamlessly integrate them with various models for Earth surface process modeling. The Data Components support the creation of open data–model integration workflows to improve the research transparency and reproducibility.\n\nA generic algorithm to automatically classify urban fabric according to the local climate zone system: implementation in GeoClimate 0.0.1 and application to French cities\n\nJÃ©rÃ©my Bernard, Erwan Bocher, Matthieu Gousseff, FranÃ§ois Leconte, and Elisabeth Le Saux Wiederhold\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2077–2116, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2077-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2077-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeographical features may have a considerable effect on local climate. The local climate zone (LCZ) system proposed by Stewart and Oke (2012) is seen as a standard approach for classifying any zone according to a set of geographic indicators. While many methods already exist to map the LCZ, only a few tools are openly and freely available. We present the algorithm implemented in GeoClimate software to identify the LCZ of any place in the world using OpenStreetMap data.\n\nModelling water isotopologues (1H2H16O, 1H217O) in the coupled numerical climate model iLOVECLIM (version 1.1.5)\n\nThomas Extier, Thibaut Caley, and Didier M. Roche\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2117–2139, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2117-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2117-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStable water isotopes are used to infer changes in the hydrological cycle for different time periods in climatic archive and climate models. We present the implementation of the δ2H and δ17O water isotopes in the coupled climate model iLOVECLIM and calculate the d- and 17O-excess. Results of a simulation under preindustrial conditions show that the model correctly reproduces the water isotope distribution in the atmosphere and ocean in comparison to data and other global circulation models.\n\nCICERO Simple Climate Model (CICERO-SCM v1.1.1) – an improved simple climate model with a parameter calibration tool\n\nMarit Sandstad, Borgar Aamaas, Ane Nordlie Johansen, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Glen Peters, BjÃ¸rn Hallvard Samset, Benjamin M.
