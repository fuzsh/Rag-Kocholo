        "meta_description": "With a detailed historical analysis of postwar Japanese female employment, this article presents three underlying policy perspectives that shape the fact that women have less chance for high-quality employment despite the rising labor force participation rate. The three assumptions of women's role in policy-making are as follows: (1) women as housewives—dependent on males, do not earn a living salary and are thus marginalized in the labor market; (2) women as individuals pursuing gender equality should be treated without discrimination in the workplace; and (3) women as key drivers for economic growth can contribute to the solution to labor shortages. The postwar history of Japanese female employment is full of interaction among these three policy perspectives. Generally, it passes through phases of the dominance of the housewife perspective, the reformation from the equality perspective and the counterattack from the housewife perspective, as well as the mainstreaming of the economic actor perspective.",

        "text": "Japanese female employment in the postwar period\n\nIn the early postwar period, the whole Japanese society was in dire need of change. The massive urbanization and industrialization in the 1950s led Japan into a period that was later often described as miraculous. From 1955 to 1973, Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 9.1% per year. In this High-Growth Era, Japan went through rapid industrialization and consequently a great transformation of lifestyle. Many rural men and women went to the city for jobs and later made a home in the city. This exactly responded to the needs of large enterprises to absorb young labor to expand production in the rising tide of economic development.\n\nGender division of labor in enterprises\n\nAfter long and unremitting efforts of labor unions, a Densan Wage System in which labor unions dominate wage setting was established. The Densan wage is based on the “seikatsukyu” thought, highlighting the satisfaction of the basic living needs of laborers and their families by taking into account the age of laborers, the number of family members, the increase over time and so on. The “seikatsukyu” thought originated from the New System of Hardwork (勤労新体制確立要綱) during the war-time period. To mobilize as many laborers for the State, work was portrayed as a citizen’s responsibility and honor to the Empire, and one should dedicate to the Empire’s cause with great enthusiasm. In return, the State will treat different categories of workers equally and guarantee an income for basic livelihood. As a result, the divide between blue-collar and white-collar workers diminished, and people began to organize labor unions within enterprises instead of around occupations or industries. Furthermore, the wage gap between blue-collar and white-collar workers gradually closed. This was later summarized as an important feature of Japanese-style employment by an expert in the history of the Japanese labor economy, Dore (1973), in his work British Factory, Japanese Factory. Japanese-style employment practices took shape in the 1960s, and three pillars—lifetime employment, seniority wages and in-house labor unions—were taken as the key to the Japanese economic miracle by the OECD in 1973 (OECD 1973).\n\nHowever, the above personnel system does not apply to women, as it presupposes males as standard workers. In the High Growth Era, women would be hired by enterprises after graduation but soon were asked to resign if they entered into marriage. In Japanese, there is a particular word, “kotobukitaisha”, to describe the situation in which women quit their jobs because of marriage. This practice agreed with the traditional custom that young women need to serve as housekeeping apprentices in another family in agricultural society and continue to the present day in many large corporations. A woman in the publishing industry recalled her job interview in the 1960s when she received the offer mainly because of the promise of leaving the job after marriage. Those who continue working after marriage usually face intense social pressures. Even if women can work, they are given a secondary role in the enterprise, as women are regarded as naturally inclined to such auxiliary work as photocopying material, visitor reception and pantry cleaning.\n\nHousewifization\n\nThe impact of housewifization cannot be neglected either. Vogel (2013), in his seminal work Japan’s New Middle Class, described the rise of a new middle class in the 1960s—the salaried man and his wife as a housewife. In regard to the gender division of labor in Japan, housewifization and the male-breadwinner model are the two most mentioned features. However, these are essential items of industrial society. When agriculture was the leading productive sector, it was common to have women as laborers. Moreover, the gender division of labor was not so strict that the workforce in a small family could be fully utilized. Therefore, the female employment rate by age group at that time presents a trapezoidal distribution (Fig. 1).\n\nHousewifization in Japanese society emerged as early as the Taisho Era (1921–1926) in middle-class families. After the Second World War, the housewife model began to prevail among ordinary people (Ochiai 2019), with new trends in mass consumer culture and urbanization. An increasing number of women withdrew from the labor market after marriage. In 1970, the M-shaped curve was very obvious, with the bottom at 44.9% in the 25-to-29 age group. This number was even lower, at 41.4% in 1975. Indeed, the impact of housewifization is far greater than that of marginalization in the workplace before marriage, as mentioned above. Because Japanese-style employment does not welcome returning employees, when women want to go back to work, they usually can only find unstable jobs, such as part-time work. Additionally, due to the emphasis on family responsibility in child rearing, out-of-home childcare does not develop. Women undertake most parenting responsibilities when children are young, leading to even limited participation in the labor market (Fig. 2).\n\nThe increase in female part-time workers\n\nPart-time work first appeared in the recruitment advertisement of the Daimaru Department Store on September 19, 1954. It was described as a fashionable employment form only for women, through which women and married women could pass their leisure time in a recreational and self-fulfilling way. It was once called into question whether the wage from part-time work could sustain a living. However, given that the advertisement was targeted at women, whose income was not seen as a living wage but as extra revenue, the criticism about low income did not evoke controversy at that time.\n\nThe Report of Policy Symposium convened by Prime Minister Ohira Masayoshi (the Ohira Report) expounded Japan’s development plan in the 1980s. Since Japan had caught up with developed economies in Europe and the US, it was time to reposition itself and devote more effort to spiritual and cultural development (Ochiai 2019). Instead of following the example of America and Europe, Japan should play through its unique cultural advantages. In terms of employment security, the Ohira Report emphasized the superiority of Japanese-style employment. Different from the American system, in which employees might be easily abandoned when a production adjustment is needed, the Japanese system, which is based on the relationship between people, usually does not fire employees, as the latter are seen as enterprise members with a sense of belonging. While alienated workers in American and European organizations might feel unvalued in the workplace and have to pursue the meaning of life outside the enterprise, thanks to the clever combination of lifetime employment and the seniority wage system, Japanese workers enjoy a reassuring competitive atmosphere resulting from the important feature of Japanese culture—group solidarity—and give the organization even more vitality. Concerning the employment of females and elderly people, the volume “Consolidating family foundation” in the Ohira Report designed an ideal lifestyle for women (Gordon 2018). After the childrearing period, less-burdened married women can participate in voluntary activities, develop hobbies and interests, and take part-time jobs. Here, part-time jobs are seen as a parallel to volunteer work and hobbies that serve to fulfill individual cultural needs instead of a means of obtaining incomes.\n\nPart-time work literally means a form of non-full-time employment. However, in Japan, it has not a matter of working hours. Part-time workers usually work as long as full-time workers. As Japanese labor law researcher Hamaguchi Keiichiro (2016) notes, nonregular employment in Japan is set up for particular social groups. Different types of nonregular jobs have different target groups. In this period, part-time work was so occupied by married women that the Japanese government let the Bureau of Women and Youth investigate the situation of part-time workers. That women mostly work part-time was to adapt to the lifestyle in the context of housewifization. Since women were widely considered supplementary earners, they were usually offered minimum wages and deprived of social insurance when working part-time. For employers, because part-time workers are cheap and can work flexible hours, they have become indispensable workforces, especially in service industries (Honda 2001). However, this does not change the fact that women are regarded as auxiliary laborers and their value is depreciated (Fig. 3).\n\nPromotion of gender equality policies and setbacks in enterprise reforms\n\nLegislation removing barriers to female employment: equal employment opportunity law\n\nAfter Japan ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1980, Japan created a domestic law accordingly—Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL)—which has been Japan’s major legal framework for implementing gender equality in private companies until now. This law prohibited discrimination against women in vocational training, fringe benefits, retirement and dismissal. As the first comprehensive law on protecting women’s rights, it was large progress. However, with regard to recruitment, promotion and job assignment, it only urged employers to “endeavor” to treat women equally with men and did not have any binding force. Before the enactment of EEOL, Article (4) of the Labor Standard Act provided the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. However, after a revision in 1997, the guideline of EEOL broke the rule by claiming men and women are under different employment categories, leading to ambiguous criteria for judging differential treatment and ultimately harming women’s rights (Mitsunari et al. 2019).\n\nThe establishment of four counter-effective institutions\n\nDual career ladder system launched by large corporations\n\nThe implementation of EEOL means that the practice of assigning jobs by gender violates the law. Therefore, Japanese enterprises headed by large corporations launched a dual career ladder system to avert possible risks. This system differentiates job positions into two types: comprehensive and general. People placed in comprehensive positions participate in core business, such as making important decisions, drafting business plans and liaising with customers. For future promotion, they are also needed to rotate among different posts. In contrast, employees in general positions often follow a fixed work routine without many challenges. They are paid less and have less chance for promotion. On the surface, this new classification has nothing to do with gender. However, in reality, because comprehensive positions usually require laborers to transfer among different locations, they are mostly given to men. According to a 2008 survey by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, in enterprises adopting a dual career ladder system, women accounted for only 6% in comprehensive positions, in sharp contrast to 77.9% in general positions. This figure was as high as 90% in large corporations over 5000 people. In the same type of survey in 2014, the situation seemed better, but the proportion of women in comprehensive positions was still only 9.1%. In this way, the dual career ladder system facilitates indirect discrimination that appears neutral to both sexes but indeed has an unfair effect on women. The United Nation once exhorted the Japanese government in the early 2000s to revise relevant provisions in EEOL and correct the part involving indirect discrimination in the dual career ladder system.\n\nWorker dispatch act\n\nFor a long period after the Second World War, private job placement services were prohibited by the Employment Security Act. In 1986, immediately after EEOL, however, the enactment of the Worker Dispatch Act legalized temporary agency firms by allowing dispatching for no more than three years in 13 occupations. The 13 occupations listed on the positive list included office equipment operator, translator, stenographer, and stewardess, in which women were concentrated. The 1980s witnessed a rise in the employment of women with advanced degrees. Many educated women who aim for long-term professional careers took dispatch work as a good chance to improve skills and accumulate experiences. It was expected that dispatch work could help them eliminate subordination and marginalization in the workplace. However, as the legal restrictions on occupations were removed bit by bit, the professionalism that dispatch work represents was significantly reduced. Instead, dispatch work had gradually turned into a form of employment that enterprises could take labor whenever needed in an uncertain prospect to save personnel costs.\n\nPension reform for female dependents\n\nAlmost the same time as EEOL, the Japanese government implemented a pension reform for male workers’ spouses. Under the Japanese pension system, there are three categories of applicants. While beneficiaries No. 1 are primarily self-employees and students, mainly participating in the national pension scheme, beneficiaries No. 2 are enterprise employees or civil servants, involved in both the national pension scheme and employees’ pension insurance plan. The 1985 pension reform added a category of No. 3 beneficiaries. This is the only group that can enjoy the pension without prior deposits. As the spouse of the No. 2 beneficiary, women can receive annuity benefits without paying insurance fees when their annual income is under 1.3 million yen. In 2010, the number of No. 3 beneficiaries joining employees’ pension insurance plans reached 10 million. The No. 3 beneficiary system made it possible for women, as spouses of enterprise employees, to have a decent pension even without a job. This not only guarantees a stable income for housewives when they get old but also consolidates the male-breadwinner/female-homemaker family model\n\nTax reform\n\nIn the 1986 tax reform, Japan set up a tax threshold of ¥1,030,000, the annual income level below which no tax is paid. More specifically, this ¥1,030,000 package includes ¥650,000—a taxation reduction for wages and ¥380,000—the basic taxation deduction that every taxpayer can enjoy.Footnote 1 In a system that takes family as the unit of taxation, a married person can claim a spousal deduction if his or her spouse earns an annual income of less than ¥1,030,000. If the female laborer earns more than that amount, not only her own income but also her husband’s spousal deduction might suffer loss. Such an income threshold has had a great impact on nonregular employment among Japanese females. Data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare show that 22.4% of female part-time workers consciously control their individual incomes under ¥1,030,000 to keep the family in a low tax bracket.Footnote 2\n\nIn this period, female employment was influenced by forces in opposite directions. On the one hand, pushed by the CEDAW of the UN, Japan established EEOL, which marked the beginning of the law-based promotion of gender equality in the workforce. On the other hand, factors holding back female employment appeared in enterprise, tax and pension institutions. The enterprises resisted by substituting gender division with the divide between comprehensive and general positions to sustain the traditional employment model. Because there was no overall framework to integrate polices of different sectoral departments with respective solutions, tax and pension systems actually reformed themselves to adapt with the male-breadwinner/female-homemaker family model. The implementation of EEOL thereby had not achieved the expected effects.\n\nDeregulation of the labor market in the 1990s and the breakout of the financial crisis in the 2000s\n\nThe expansion of nonregular employment\n\nBefore the 1980s, the total number and share of nonregular employees among Japan’s labor force was quite stable. However, in 1980, the number of nonregular employees increased very quickly, especially women workers. The rapid expansion of nonregular employment in this period could be attributed to the boom of the tertiary industry. More importantly, it was closely related to the transformation of the Japanese employment style. Moving away from the conventional system based on long-term employment, Japan began to reduce living guarantees and vocational training for some employees. In May 1995, the Japan Business Federation proposed an employment portfolio system in “Japanese Business in New Age: Challenges, Directions and Action Plan”. This system classified laborers into three types: long-term reserves, highly specialized workers, and flexible workers, corresponding to regular, fixed-term contracts or dispatch, and part-time employees. By combining different types of employees, enterprises were able to drastically lower personnel costs.\n\nSimilar changes that support nonregular employment occurred in labor-related laws in parallel. In 1996, the Dispatch Act was extended to cover 26 occupations. In 1999, the method of regulating occupation types was changed from positive listing to negative listing. Apart from construction workers, port transport workers, security guards, lawyers and accountants, restrictions on all other occupations were removed. In 2004, the one-year limit on workers dispatching for manufacturing occupations was finally lifted. In the same period, the Labor Standards Law also underwent a series of revisions to facilitate the hiring of workers under fixed-term contracts. In 1999, the revisions expanded the duration of fixed-term contracts from one to three years in select occupations such as those requiring specialized skills or knowledge and for workers aged 60 and over. In 2003, additional revisions increased the duration of fixed-term contracts to three years for all people. For jobs requiring specialized skills or older workers, the maximum duration of the contract further increased to five years.\n\nDespite the instability of nonregular employment, reflection on the working style under Fordism during this period made people care more about the problems of ignoring personal life, such as death by overwork and enterprise warriors. Indeed, nonregular employment was once regarded as a postmodern form of employment and popular among young people (Kosugi 2003). Great hope was placed on nonregular employment that could allow people to decide the pace of life and not to bind themselves to particular enterprises for life.\n\nAdjustment after the financial crisis\n\nUntil the breakout of the financial crisis in 2008, the image of nonregular workers was students earning pocket money, young people pursuing hobbies and working temporarily and married women working part time to supplement family income. One thing that the above groups have in common was that they did not rely on nonregular jobs for a living but worked to support household finance. However, as nonregular employment was scaling up, nonregular workers were extended to men groups, including young college graduates and those who depended on nonregular jobs for a living. Despite the fluctuations in economy, the proportion of both male and female nonregular workers continued to rise in the 2000s. Due to the fundamental transformation of the employment model within enterprises, the group of precarious workers expanded. Even men who used to be able to gain stable jobs fell into that group working part-time or for a fixed duration. The problem of nonregular employment was thereby elevated from a labor issue of women to an important topic of the whole country.\n\nIn 2008, a large number of dispatch workers were fired because of the sudden economic crisis. Later, their rally at Tokyo Hibiya Park aroused wide public concern. People began to realize that nonregular employment could no longer be integrated into Japanese-style employment routines and the social system of male breadwinners/female homemakers, as an increasing number of single and married people relied on nonregular jobs for a living and were profoundly affected by their unsteady jobs. The ensuing problems, such as the widening gap of wealth and social inequity, have also received substantial scholarly attention (Sato 2000; Tachibanaki 1998). To relieve these problems, after the financial crisis, Japan adjusted related laws and regulations. For instance, labor protection was added to the Work Dispatch Act, which was used to relax labor control in the past. Similar contents could also be found in the 2007 Part-time Employment Act.\n\nIncreasing female nonregular workers, decreasing male incomes and the trend toward a conservative gender division of labor\n\nAccording to the Labor Force Survey conducted by the Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, between 1995 and 2013, the number of women in the workforce was quite stable, approximately 26 million. However, during the same period, the number of female nonregular workers grew drastically and exceeded that of regular workers in 2003 (Fig. 4).\n\nNevertheless, in this period, not only were women facing the risk of instability and low income, but men’s labor market also changed greatly. An increasing number of men became nonregular workers, and male workers in general suffered a wage decline. After the peak of 4.088 million yen in 1995, the annual income of males exhibited a fluctuating downward trend overall, with 3.912 million yen in 2013 (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 2020). Affected by pay stagnation and job insecurity, both men and women were more inclined to agree with the traditional gender division. That women regained admiration for housewives provided a compelling portrait of the intensified stratification within the female group. With the female employment rate drifting higher, the shift to gender conservatism also reflected a complex reality of the gap between belief and action.\n\nAccording to Ronald Inglehart (2016), a society will experience a shift from materialist to postmaterialist values, from giving top priority to physical sustenance and safety toward a heavier emphasis on belonging, self-expression and quality life, including gender equality, when it reaches a certain level of affluence. However, this is not a unidirectional change as observed in Japanese’s notions of gender roles. According to Ojima (2000), both men and women were adhering less to traditional gender norms in the years between 1972 and 1995. However, a perceptible change occurred in approximately 2000. With the latest data, Nagase and Taromaru (2016) found that the year 2003 marked a reversal in both genders, although there was an obvious trend in gender role norms from 1973 to 2003.Footnote 3 Moreover, this result was verified in all age groups. A survey conducted by the Cabinet Office in 2012 showed that the number of supporters of the male breadwinner/female-homemaker model exceeded that of objectors. In particular, it is worth noting that the increase in supporters was the first since 1979, which reflected a time lag between the change in values and socioeconomic dynamics.\n\nFemale employment after 2010\n\nCall for female and senior employment under labor shortage\n\nSince the 2010s, Japan has been facing a serious challenge in filling the labor gap for economic development due to the acute shortage in the 15–64 working-age population in the context of rapidly aging and dwindling populations. Different from other developed economies, Japan has been taking a very cautious approach toward labor immigration, except for highly skilled talent and specialized nursery staff. In fact, to control the number of foreign laborers, the Abe Administration, in its second term, began to formulate policies to promote female and senior employment. The Japan Revitalization Strategy and Act on the Promotion of Female Participation and Career Advancement in the Workplace were announced in 2013 and 2015, respectively. To improve the female employment rate, the Japanese government presented the following measures: adding nursery resources to satisfy childcare needs, changing the corporate culture of working overtime to facilitate women and the elderly to participate in the workforce, and eliminating the unreasonable pay gap between nonregular and regular employees. As a result, the employment rates for all age groups have significantly increased, especially those in the 25–39 and 60–64 age groups, whose numbers reached the highest since 1959 (Employment Environment and Equality Bureau, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare 2021). The M-shaped curve basically disappeared, and the proportion of women who would like to return to work after giving birth also increased (Ochiai 2019).\n\nHowever, researchers have raised questions regarding whether the Abe Cabinet’s policy could give full play to women’s talent in the public sphere. Sechiyama (2014) noted that the key topics that hold women back from their full potential, such as different family names for men and women, tax reduction for spouses and No.3 beneficiary system were still untouched. In addition, Miura Mari (2015) drew attention to the expanding gap within the female group under the dual influence of neoliberalism and state familialism. To avoid women being treated as a policy instrument for achieving economic growth in the context of below-replacement fertility, women should take a more active role in policy-making.\n\nEmployment difficulty and unemployment among women since COVID-19\n\nToo high a proportion of nonregular workers, low-quality employment, and unstable jobs have long been the main problems of female employment that trouble the Japanese government. The Fourth Basic Plan for Gender Equality promulgated in 2015 included certain goals of improving the quality of female employment, especially setting the proportion for female entrepreneurs, senior officers, middle and senior managers, as well as national public servants, local civil servants, policewomen and firefighters.\n\nAs Fig. 4 shows, the numbers of both regular and nonregular workers among women have grown since 2013. From January 2013 to January 2020 (before the breakout of COVID-19), the number of female regular workers increased by 11.53%, from 10.58 million to 11.8 million. The same figures for female nonregular workers were 18.71%, 12.45 million and 14.78 million. This reflected an important trend that the share of nonregular workers among women might no longer increase rapidly but tend to stabilize."
