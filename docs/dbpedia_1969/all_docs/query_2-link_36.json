Dickson, a starter for his first six seasons before spending time as the Buffaloes – and Team USA closer – from 2019, was expected to return to Orix’s starting rotation this season.\n\n3 Fighters KO’d by virus\n\nThree Nippon Ham Fighters, outfielder Haruki Nishikawa, shortstop Takuya Nakashima and catcher Yushi Shimizu were all sidelined Friday by positive coronavirus tests, and they were joined by outfielder Daiki Asama, who is quarantining as a potential close contact.\n\nThe Coronavirus Kid returns\n\nThe Lotte Marines on Friday lifted the indefinite suspension on Ikuhiro Kiyota, who was held responsible for the Lotte Marines’ 2020 coronavirus outbreak that sidelined 14 players. The outbreak was discovered after the club returned from a road trip to Sapporo, although no players were known to have violated protocols. Kioyota, however, was suspended after photos of him eating out with a female companion while in Sapporo were later published.\n\nYanagi outduels Sugano\n\nDragons 3, Giants 2\n\nAt Tokyo Dome, Chunichi’s Yuya Yanagi (2-1) threw an artistic seven innings, locating his fastball and mixing it with a dynamite curve and changeup to strike out nine while allowing two runs in his seventh and final inning of work.\n\nThe right-hander gave up four hits, two in the seventh, and walked three. The walks forced him to escape a two-out bases-loaded jam in the second by retiring Sugano. Yanagi dominated for the next four innings before hard-hit balls by Justin Smoak and Zelous Wheeler set the table for the Yomiuri fightback.\n\nTomoyuki Sugano (2-2) lacked his customary razor-sharp command, and threw hittable strikes when he got behind in counts and allowed six hits but no walks. Sugano was burned in the second when Dayan Viciedo turned on an inside fastball and lined it into the left-field stands at the ballpark – emptied of fans due to the coronavirus state of emergency in effect that also forced the games at Koshien and Kyocera Dome to be held behind closed doors. The home run was Viciedo’s third.\n\nWith two on and one out in the inning, Akira Neo grounded to first but Smoak failed to stop it for a run-scoring error. After Yanagi hit the ball hard for the second out, Sugano hit a batter to load the bases. However, the ace passed his biggest test of the night by striking out Yota Kyoda on four pitches.\n\nAkira Neo doubled and scored in the fourth on a single by rookie Wataru Takamatsu, who drove in the first run of his career.\n\nKatsuki Matayoshi worked a scoreless eighth instead of regular setup man Daisuke Sobue, and Raidel Martinez carved up the heart of the Giants order in the ninth for his third save.\n\nGiants-Dragons highlights\n\nSwallows 4, BayStars 0\n\nAt Yokohama Stadium, Yakult rookie Yuto Kanakubo (1-1) struck out six over six innings, while DeNA lefty Yuya Sakamoto took a direct hit on his pitching shoulder from a Munekata Murakami line drive to open the second and left the game.\n\nTetsuto Yamada doubled in two runs in the third inning, and the visitors added two more in the sixth, when Jose Osuna doubled with two outs and scored on Domingo Santana’s second home run off fellow first-year import Kevin Shackelford.\n\nTigers 4, Carp 2\n\nAt Koshien Stadium, Hiroshima’s Allen Kuri (3-3) did well to only allow four runs over five innings after walking four over the first two. He walked six and allowed eight hits, while Hanshin’s Takumi Akiyama (3-2) gave up two runs over 7-1/3 innings.\n\nJerry Sands broke the ice in the first with a two-out RBI single, and walked and scored in the Tigers’ two-run fifth. Kevin Cron broke up the Tigers’ bid for a shutout in the eighth with a pinch-hit leadoff homer, his third. Hanshin closer Robert Suarez pitched a scoreless ninth for his seventh save.\n\nRookie Takumu Nakano reached base twice and scored the Tigers second run while putting on a fielding clinic at shortstop.\n\nEagles 8, Marines 1\n\nAt Rakuten Seimei Park, Rauten’s Hideaki Wakui (4-0) walked four, including three straight in the second inning to give Lotte the lead, only for the Marines to return the favor with back-to-back two-out errors and two unearned runs in the home half.\n\nBrandon Dixon and Japanese baseball culture\n\nMarines starter Toshiya Nakamura (0-1) allowed five runs, three earned over five innings. Brandon Dixon tripled in two runs in the third as the Eagles cruised.\n\nLions 5, Fighters 1\n\nAt Sapporo Dome, Seibu’s Kona Takahashi (4-0) allowed a run over six innings, followed by scoreless innings from Reed Garrett and Kaima Taira before the Lions opened the game up in the ninth on Sosuke Genda’s two-run triple. Tomoya Mori doubled and tripled and scored two of Seibu’s first three runs.\n\nDrew VerHagen (0-2) allowed three runs, two earned, over 5-1/3 innings to take the loss.\n\nBuffaloes 5, Hawks 4\n\nAt Osaka’s Kyocera Dome, Orix victimized SoftBank’s normally reliable bullpen to overturn the visitors’ late 4-2 lead, scoring a run off setup man Livan Moinelo and two off Sho Iwasaki (1-1), who worked the ninth in place of right-handed closer Yuito Mori, who was deactivated to have inflammation in his left elbow treated.\n\nShuta Ishikawa allowed two runs, one earned, over seven innings but came up empty.\n\nMasataka Yoshida opened Orix’s eighth with his sixth home run on an off night for Moinelo, who walked two batters. The lefty got a double play and escaped the inning with the tying run at the plate when pinch-runner Yuya Ota was out trying to take second on a bounced pitch.\n\nYuma Tongu and Kotaro Kurebayashi singled to open the ninth. After a failed two-strike bunt, Yuma Mune doubled them both home over the drawn-in outfield to win it.\n\nStarting pitchers\n\nPacific League\n\nFighters vs Lions: Sapporo Dome 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nNaoyuki Uwasawa (2-2, 4.31) vs Keisuke Honda (0-1, 4.91)\n\nEagles vs Marines: Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nMasahiro Tanaka (1-1, 3.27) vs Kota Futaki (1-1, 2.42)\n\nBuffaloes vs Hawks: Kyocera Dome (Osaka) 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nHirotoshi Masui (1-2, 2.82) vs Nick Martinez (-)\n\nCentral League\n\nGiants vs Dragons: Tokyo Dome 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nNobutaka Imamura (2-0, 1.62) vs Shinnosuke Ogasawara (1-2, 2.45)\n\nBayStars vs Swallows: Yokohama Stadium 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nKo Nakagawa (0-0, 0.00) vs Hirotoshi Takanashi (2-0, 3.43)\n\nTigers vs Carp: Koshien Stadium 2 pm, 1 am EDT\n\nMasashi Ito (2-0, 1.71) vs Koya Takahashi (1-0, 1.74)\n\nActive roster moves 4/30/2021\n\nDeactivated players can be re-activated from 5/10\n\nCentral League\n\nActivated\n\nDectivated\n\nPacific League\n\nActivated\n\nDectivated\n\nSubscribe this week and get 1 free month\n\nDo you enjoy jballallen.com?

Rather than play in an empty park on a holiday afternoon, the Yakult Swallows postponed their Central League game with the Yomiuri Giants while the Pacific League’s Orix Buffaloes also put off their home game against the Rakuten Eagles.\n\nChen links\n\nTigers 6, Dragons 4\n\nAt Nagoya‘s Vantelin Dome Chen Wei-Yin (1-0) returned to Nagoya with a flourish, winning his first game in Japan since 2011 and his first as a Hanshin Tigers against his old club, allowing a run over six innings, striking out four, walking none while allowing five hits and getting a pair of double plays. Cleanup hitter Yusuke Oyama drove in four runs to help the Central League leaders snap a seven-game losing streak at Nagoya Dome.\n\n“I wasn’t that good at the start of the game, and I was able to get a lot of support from my teammates,” Chen said in Mandarin through a Japanese language interpreter. “In particular (Jefry) Marte and Oyama put runs on the board that allowed me the breathing room to settle in.”\n\n“I never think much about whether the team is in a losing streak or on a winning streak,” said Chen, whose win snapped a three-game skid. “Thanks to Ryu (catcher Ryutaro Umeno) calling such a steady game, I could just focus on executing my pitches, so I’m grateful to him.”\n\nMarte sparked the Tigers offense with a two-out first-inning triple, a drive to the center field wall that Yohei Oshima nearly caught. Oyama then singled past short off Koji Fukutani (1-2) to open the scoring. The Tigers made it 4-0 in the third. Kento Itohara doubled with one out, Marte walked, and Oyama hit his fifth home run.\n\nFukutani allowed four runs over six innings on six hits and a walk.\n\nBeing Japan, we couldn’t be spared the number 3,497 — the number of days since Chen’s last win in Japan.\n\nBayStars 5, Carp 3,\n\nAt Hiroshima’s Mazda Stadium, Tyler Austin and Neftali Soto showed Japan what it’s been missing early in the season as the pair untied a 1-1 game with one home run each in a three-run third.\n\nAustin went deep for the second straight day with a leadoff homer, and Toshiro Miyazaki’s two-out walk set the table for Soto’s two-run shot off Carp rookie Shogo Tamamura (0-1) in his pro debut baptism of fire. The lefty had been 2-0 in the Western League with some solid numbers, striking out 17 in 17 innings with just three walks, 13 hits and no home runs.\n\nHaruhiro Hamaguchi (1-3) DeNA’s Opening Day starter, allowed three runs on seven hits and no walks over six-plus innings to post his fourth quality start. The lefty got the hook after allowing two runs on three straight no-out hits in the seventh. Edwin Escobar stranded a runner in the inning. Former closer Yasuaki Yamasaki and his successor, Kazuki Mishima kept the Carp of the board in the eighth and ninth with Mishima earning his third save.\n\nMarines 5, Lions 2\n\nAt MetLife Dome, Lotte’s Daiki Iwashita (3-2) allowed two runs over six innings while striking out seven, and Leonys Martin got the Marines rolling with a two-run first-inning homer, his Japan-best 10th, off Sho Ito (0-1).\n\nThe Marines bullpen resumed normal uninterrupted service with a hat-trick of one-strikeout perfect innings by Frank Herrmann, Yuki Karakawa and closer Naoya Masuda, who earned his fifth save. Marines leadoff man Takashi Ogino walked, singled and scored twice.\n\nThe Lions were poised to pull even in the home half of the first with one run in, one out and the bases loaded. Wu Nien-ting chopped a fat pitch up the middle, but Yudai Fujioka dove to keep the ball in the infield and flip to second for a force as a run scored.\n\nIwashita responded by retiring 16 of the next 18 batters he faced before making way for the bullpen, which retired nine straight.\n\nThe Lions’ bright spot was 5-2/3 innings of one-run relief from troubled starter Wataru Matsumoto, who struck out five and walked none.\n\nHawks 2, Fighters 1\n\nAt Fukuoka’s PayPay Dome, SoftBank’s Shota Takeda (2-1) won a pitchers’ duel against surprising Nippon Ham journeyman Takahide Ikeda (2-3), with seven scoreless innings.\n\nIkeda, acquired in the March deal that sent slugging reserve infielder Taketoshi Yokoo to the Eagles, held the Hawks to two runs over seven runs in his fourth straight quality start. Akira Nakamura opened the scoring with his second homer in the sixth, and Yusuke Masago hit his first of the season in the seventh.\n\nLivan Moinelo worked the eighth for SoftBank, and Yuito Mori worked around the third homer of the season by No. 2 hitter – Pro Yakyu News guys eat your hearts out – Sho Nakata to earn his eighth save.\n\nWang Po-jung went 2-for-2 with a walk in his season debut for Nippon Ham, but squandered his third-inning leadoff double trying for third in an inning in which the Fighters still stranded a runner.\n\nStarting pitchers\n\nPacific League\n\nFighters vs Lions: Sapporo Dome 6 pm, 5 am EDT\n\nDrew VerHagen (0-1, 4.26) vs Kona Takahashi (3-0, 3.06)\n\nEagles vs Marines: Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi 6 pm, 5 am EDT\n\nHideaki Wakui (3-0, 1.47) vs Toshiya Nakamura (0-0, 1.80)\n\nBuffaloes vs Hawks: Kyocera Dome (Osaka) 6 pm, 5 am EDT\n\nTaisuke Yamaoka (1-2, 2.32) vs Shuta Ishikawa (1-2, 3.15)\n\nCentral League\n\nGiants vs Dragons: Tokyo Dome 6 pm, 5 am EDT\n\nTomoyuki Sugano (2-1, 1.74) vs Yuya Yanagi (1-1, 1.97)\n\nBayStars vs Swallows: Yokohama Stadium 5:45 pm, 4:45 am EDT\n\nYuya Sakamoto (1-1, 3.27) vs Yuto Kanakubo (1-0, 2.93)\n\nTigers vs Carp: Koshien Stadium 6 pm, 5 am EDT\n\nTakumi Akiyama (2-2, 3.91) vs Allen Kuri (3-2, 2.65)\n\nActive roster moves 4/29/2021\n\nDeactivated players can be re-activated from 5/9\n\nCentral League\n\nActivated\n\nDectivated\n\nPacific League\n\nActivated\n\nDectivated"
