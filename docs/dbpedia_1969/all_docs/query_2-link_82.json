        "text": "Celebrate the day he paid off his mortgage after 32 years with Matsuoka Nohara Hiroshi Junmai Daiginjo, a liquor manufactured by the 1851-founded Matsuoka Brewing Co., LTD.\n\nNohara Hiroshi, the good dad representative, has paid off the mortgage after 32 years. Serialization of “Crayon Shin-chan” began in 1990 and ran for more than 30 years. “The mortgage loan that has been carried for 32 years has not been paid yet,” as the father of the main character Shin-chan, Nohara Hiroshi, once stated in the original comic. However, as time passes, and “Crayon Shin-chan” reaches its 33rd year of serialization, Hiroshi Nohara has also officially bid farewell to his 32-year mortgage.\n\nIn order to produce this commemorative edition of Junmai Daiginjo made by Matsuoka Brewing Co., Ltd. in Saitama Prefecture, the Japanese sake brand “KURAND” and the “Crayon Shin-chan” team worked together across international lines. It was awarded Japan’s “National New Sake” distinction for its superior quality and brewing technique. The general flavor is soft and pleasant, much like Hiroshi’s kind disposition. With its smooth and sweet flavor, “shu Junmai Daiginjo” is not only enjoyable to drink, but it has also earned eight gold medals in a row. This Junmai Daiginjo sake is a versatile drink that can play the lead or supporting part since it possesses both power and depth in addition to its graceful and beautiful side.\n\nAside from the carefully chosen sake rice from Saitama Prefecture, the label showcases the attractive picture of Hiroshi and quotes from “Crayon Shin-chan: The Storm is Rising!” A memorable line from the animated film “The Empire Strikes Back” is, “My life is not boring at all, and I want to share the happiness of my family with you!” With a limited edition Hiroshi Nohara label, it offers a mild and gentle sake that is ideal for Hiroshi, who enjoys alcoholic drinks. The ideal evening drink for diligent dads is now available with a limited edition “Hiroshi Nohara” sake label.\n\nEnjoy this bottle of naturally occurring water that is rich in minerals. This sake is a celebration of Nohara Hiroshi and a mark of respect for all fathers who work hard and support their family in all facets of their lives. Savor the subtlety and smoothness of the drink, and remember that all fathers do is work silently and selflessly out of love."
