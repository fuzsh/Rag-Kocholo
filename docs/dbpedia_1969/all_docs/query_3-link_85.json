        "text": "Background: Shift work sleep disorders (SWSDs) are associated with the high turnover rates of nurses, and are considered a major medical safety issue. However, initial management can be hampered by insufficient awareness. In recent years, it has become possible to visualize, collect, and analyze the work-life balance of health care workers with irregular sleeping and working habits using wearable sensors that can continuously monitor biometric data under real-life settings. In addition, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychiatric disorders has been shown to be effective. Application of wearable sensors and machine learning may potentially enhance the beneficial effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. Objective: In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate the effect of a new internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for SWSD (iCBTS). This system includes current methods such as medical sleep advice, as well as machine learning well-being prediction to improve the sleep durations of shift workers and prevent declines in their well-being. Methods: This study consists of two phases: (1) preliminary data collection and machine learning for well-being prediction; (2) intervention and evaluation of iCBTS for SWSD. Shift workers in the intensive care unit at Mie University Hospital will wear a wearable sensor that collects biometric data and answer daily questionnaires regarding their well-being. They will subsequently be provided with an iCBTS app for 4 weeks. Sleep and well-being measurements between baseline and the intervention period will be compared. Results: Recruitment for phase 1 ended in October 2019. Recruitment for phase 2 has started in October 2020. Preliminary results are expected to be available by summer 2021. Conclusions: iCBTS empowered with well-being prediction is expected to improve the sleep durations of shift workers, thereby enhancing their overall well-being. Findings of this study will reveal the potential of this system for improving sleep disorders among shift workers.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Internet-based individualized cognitive behavioral therapy for shift work sleep disorder empowered by well-being prediction\n\nT2 - Protocol for a pilot study\n\nAU - Ito-Masui, Asami\n\nAU - Kawamoto, Eiji\n\nAU - Sakamoto, Ryota\n\nAU - Yu, Han\n\nAU - Sano, Akane\n\nAU - Motomura, Eishi\n\nAU - Tanii, Hisashi\n\nAU - Sakano, Shoko\n\nAU - Esumi, Ryo\n\nAU - Imai, Hiroshi\n\nAU - Shimaoka, Motomu\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: Â© Asami Ito-Masui, Eiji Kawamoto, Ryota Sakamoto, Han Yu, Akane Sano, Eishi Motomura, Hisashi Tanii, Shoko Sakano, Ryo Esumi, Hiroshi Imai, Motomu Shimaoka.\n\nPY - 2021/3\n\nY1 - 2021/3\n\nN2 - Background: Shift work sleep disorders (SWSDs) are associated with the high turnover rates of nurses, and are considered a major medical safety issue.
