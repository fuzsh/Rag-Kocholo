        "text": "This post is a continuation of the public structure I am designing for University of Arts London Graduate Diploma in Interior Design Unit 2 Project. This project explores the idea of community and interaction. As the pandemic has drastically changed our way of living, I want to look further at how we can strengthen our sense of community and social responsibility after having lived and worked so long in self isolation. How can design interventions spark interactions between strangers and their environment in public spaces post lockdown to foster a sense of belonging and community? For my research, I will be exploring the origins and evolution of glass pavilions, outdoor installations and glass manipulation. I will be analysing what aspects of my selected inspirational images I would like to take forward.\n\nGlass Pavilions\n\nI am intrigued by the evolution of the pavilion for its ever changing form and function and the opportunity for experimentation that it provides. Though the materials possibilities are endless, I will be focusing on glass pavilions. These glass pavilions are relatively new beginning in the 19th century. Two examples being the Crystal Palace in 1851 by Sir Joseph Paxton and the Glass Pavilion in 1914 by Bruno Taut. The Crystal Palace was built with 1000 iron columns and 84,000 square meters of glass and built in 5 months. (Merin, 2013) The Glass Pavilion was made with new glass technology and concrete.\n\nThese designs though vastly different are both monumental in stature with a very solid and ornate appearance. Going forward, I plan to take forward the play and use of glass but in a more fluid and modest way. Instead of a space for or piece of an exhibition, it will be a place for leisure and reflection.\n\nTwo modern designs of the glass pavilion that I am contemplating are the Glass Pavilion Bus Shelter by WV-Studio (2013) and the Shell Centre Pavilion proposal by Marks Barfield Architects (2014). I am interested in the way these two designs melt into the landscape providing an almost magical touch, inspiring a feel of wonder and calm. Unlike the Shell Centre Pavilion, I would like to continue with the near-liquid movement of the Glass Pavilion Bus Shelter and will look at playing with similar forms. It is interesting to see as well the effects created by the fluted glass, and I look forward to conducting my own experiments to see how different glass manipulations could possibly work together or with their landscape surroundings.\n\nOutdoor Installation Art\n\nArguably one of the first examples of installation art was 176,000 years ago as seen in this Bruniquel Cave of Southern France where Neanderthals framed the room with circles of collected stalagmites. What carries over here to my project proposal is this use of 3 dimensional, site-specific works that transform the perception of the space. This contrast of man-made (or Neanderthal-made as we have here) dramatizes the landscape through the sharp contrast, enticing an air of mystery. One difference, however, is that I would like my art installation to blend in with the outdoor space. This is where I will focus my research.\n\nSculpture gardens can be seen back as far as the Roman Empire as statues were placed in public spaces and gardens. It wasn’t until the thinking of designers changed, such as Isamu Noguchi in the 1920’s that we see the sculptures begin to transform the landscape. Kirsch (2012) states that Noguchi realized a problem of integration, “of considering the site not merely as a background but as an essential part of the sculptures to which every element relates”. I believe it is with this way of thinking that we see a move from static sculpture gardens to intimate and interactive, outdoor instillations.\n\nReferences\n\nMerin, G.

In Unit 2, we move from the domestic to public sphere. For part one of this project, we are asked to create a brief for a temporary structure and propose a design. We are provided the freedom to determine our own design research interest. I have chosen the social realm, comparing personal interactions between strangers and community members. As the pandemic has drastically changed our way of living, I want to look further at how we can strengthen our sense of community and social responsibility after having lived and worked so long in self isolation. My research question is how can design interventions spark interactions between strangers in public spaces post lockdown to foster a sense of belonging and community?\n\n1. Media\n\nThe temporary structure is composed of a glass structure with a circulating pathway through the space. The manipulation of glass and light is used to re-frame and distort the view of neighbouring people and the cityscape. As it is a temporary structure, the building materials are all repurposed or biodegradable with exception of the adhesive glue for the flooring.\n\nThe supporting frame for the structure’s ramp floor is made from reclaimed wood from the area. This supports the winding floor of the interior made of custom-made, biodegradable wheat bran panels. The four inch panels share the translucent effect of the glass, are waterproof, and will have a rough, waved texture to provide traction and prevent slipping. The supplier for these panels are BioTrem. The panels are fixed to the wooden support beams via neoprene glue. Alternatives to these panels would be bio-composite resin from Ottan Standard Materials or recycled glass mosaic tiles from Zumi.\n\nThe walls are constructed of triple-ply recycled glass bottle tiles by Cao | Perrot Studio. Medicine bottles and glass beads comprise of these glass tiles that are insulating, sound diffusing, scratch resistant and can be infinitely recycled. The tiles are assembled and held together using bio resin. The panels are then raised into place and held together using bio cement. Ideally, for this project, two metre custom, circular panels would be optimal. If this is not possible, the panels would only have a length of one tile and be placed side by side in order to achieve a more rounded appearance for the walls.\n\nFinally, the interior glass panels dividing the curved ramp walkway are of glass sculptures and panels of different height and thicknesses. When looking through these glass sculptures panes, the object on the opposite side seems distorted from its natural form. The series of panels go from very obscure to clear through the different effects and forms of the glass.\n\n2. Image Content\n\nAs people begin to move back into public areas post lockdown, it can be intimidating leaving home and coming into regular contact with people. The purpose of this space is to provide the average passer-by an amusing distraction from the unease of being outdoors as well as allow them the opportunity to meet someone new in a fun, light-hearted and non-intimidating way. These unplanned meetings foster a sense of community, belonging and social responsibility.\n\nThe site is located at the Duke of York Square to the right of Vardo Restaurant when facing the entrance from King’s Road. This was decided in order to collect the greatest diversity of users, may they be tourists or long-standing members of the community. This square is also an area in which people are a bit more free with their time, as some may be using the day for shopping, meeting friends or sight-seeing. The space will be open during the business hours of local shops and restaurants.\n\nThe entrance of the building is two purpose. The user is not immediately engulfed by a full wall but walks into it gradually. This is to ease the user into the space but also mark this transition from a period where we became used to only seeing a colleague, friend or family member’s torso and never their full body. Once inside this space, we are back to our current reality where it is once again possible to see the full body.\n\nThe structure’s location within the Duke of York Square. (Artist’s own, 23 March 2021)\n\n3. Emotional Response\n\nThe first emotional response inspired by the design is first curiosity. The structure does not shout for attention through garish colours or patterns it sits patiently, blurred in its surroundings, it waits for you to take notice. If you have some minutes to spare, the peculiarity of this design with its dazzle glass camouflage will lure you in.\n\nAs you enter the space, the textures and the light hitting the glass as the you moves through the space captures your attention and you are gradually swallowed by the space. You begin to feel you are in a world away from the one you were just in, a bit disoriented.\n\nYou begin to feel the sense of being watched. To you are slightly shocked at the creature next to you. It seems familiar but distorted. You laugh, look closer, and move on once you realise it is a person on the other side looking at you through opaque glass. As you continue to the next glass sculpture/panel to the next the glass becomes clearer and clearer until you reach the top to the inclining ramp. You couldn’t resist touching the glass from time to time to feel the soothing cool textures of the glass. Hopefully no one noticed.\n\nYou are eager to see where this opens out into. It is a room that centres everyone’s attention to a window. There is a long rectangle framing the view of the Saachi field and its background of trees. The wall cut-put window is partially filled in different size squares of glass. The new version of this possibly otherwise boring view makes you stop. You are completely distracted admiring the different frames and how they change the image behind it. People sit on short pillar stools of different heights taking in the view. You however have a lunch to attend and instead continue down the other side of the ramp separated by morphed glass.\n\nThe art is the other person. The passer-by taking interest in your image through the glass. It makes a form of interaction. It creates a moment to enjoy the sense of community. You leave the space, back into the square. You are a bit in wonder and reflect on what you experienced. It’s a story to tell your friends. Ah, just in case, a little hand sanitizer before reaching the lunch venue.\n\n4. Technical Description\n\nThe entire structure is fixed together once assembled and then stays put. The temporary structure then meets the people on the street by opening its entrance toward the flow of people coming west, down Chelsea’s Kings Road from The Sloane Subway Station. The right side of the ramp wall wings outward encouraging the flow of people to enter in and upward into the space. The glass sculptures lining the scenter of the ramp act as a division. At the same time, the glass distorts the image of the user through its form, texture or shape. The path brings the user counter clockwise into the top viewpoint. Low pillars offer individual seating, a few feet apart. As you turn back, you follow to the right back down and out onto the square. While the right ramp is wide enough for wheelchair users access the winds slightly steeper which is indicated by the blue glass pillars in front of the ramp access.\n\n5. Told Through A Story\n\nEverything I was once familiar with seems foreign. I am embarrassed to think it. But I am apprehensive of leaving my home. Excited but not sure of how the changes will be since I last explored the streets of Chelsea. I wonder what has changed. I keep my distance as I leave the house. I think I see my colleague from our Legal Department at work… at least that would be them should the decide on exploring the idea of a full lumberjack beard and moustache. Sounds seem louder and I am no longer sure how to approach things. I came out here for once for no errand but to do absolutely nothing but chill with a friend. I arrive at our location. Some things are different but overall familiar. A bit more people around then I am used to. I search for my friend or an escape where he may still see me. A sculpture or building of some sort catches my eye to my left. I stare. Watch people disappear inside. I watch. Finally, I am awoken to my senses as my friend calls out my name behind me.\n\nMedia\n\nThe image is a black and white photograph.\n\nContent\n\nIn the image, we are looking up at a rectangular building whose exterior is made up of aged, concrete slabs. The concrete slabs show watermarks and age. From the angle, the photographer must be crouched low, close to the cement floor. The building is shown from an angle that reveals two sides of the building. From the angle the photo was taken, the right wall appears twice as long. On this right wall, we see a door on its left side. The door is raised about 54 cm from the floor. There are no steps leading to the door. Instead, the door seems to be hovering, suspended in the air. To the right of the door is an antique bike with wide handlebars and a small headlight. On the top right of the wall are two white panels, the size of four cement slabs, with two metal clasps on each side of its corners. The building’s left wall is cut at a sharp angle by the roof that lowers down to the back left of the building. At the highest point, the wall is 5 cement slabs in height. At the lowest end, it is 3 cement slabs tall. The roof reaches out Extending out past the building’s edge. The ground around the building is flat cement that only rolls upward with a light hill upraised at the back left corner of the building. It seems to reach up towards the roof’s overhang. As for the surroundings, we can see a distant forest line to the far left. On the right, we have a small parking lot style garden with a tree and four short shrubs surrounded by raised cement barrier about 10 centimetres in height. A post is tied to the tree to keep it standing straight. The sky is clear.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nI froze at this photograph whilst scrolling down the seemingly endless columns of photographs. The building in the photo had a demanding presence. At first glance, the structure seems in ruins, forgotten but still standing. Perhaps demolished from a past bombing raid that took out the stair that would have once lead to the front door. Looking closer, we see the body is intact. Only aged by the weather. The intrigue is not lost. Perhaps it demanding presence protected is from the fashion the photograph was taken, for the building itself is rather ordinary. Or maybe the way it is able to hold itself so well, alone. It is still beautiful. Beautiful in its age and simplicity. It emits a feeling of peace. I am curious, I want to know the story behind the door. Is the lack of stairs a mistake? A measure of protection? Symbolism? Where will this door take me?\n\nTechnical Description\n\nThere are no windows on this building from what we can see. It is constructed, as previously mentioned, by concrete slabs. Each slab is around 100 cm. The left wall has a length of 5 1/3 slabs. The right wall has a length of 8 2/3 slabs. The shed roof slices the building with its single roof at a 40 degree angle. The door on the right wall also appears to be metal. It is inset 1 1/3 slabs from the edge of the wall. It is a bouquet of horizontal lines balanced by a weighty angle.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMy thoughts travel back to the doorway. What could be the reason for it being raised so high from the ground with no supporting steps? Is it to bring an unfounded sense on intrigue?\n\nLet us step back and think of what could be the purpose of this building… is it a house? I believe this unlikely for there is not a single window to let the light and view in. A factory? I would think it to be a bit too small but possibly a workshop. Maybe it is a store? A store where the door is a way of luring people in. And the door is a representation of the products inside made in the time of capitalism and the modern market. This door is obscure,like the products inside. The bag you hold states that its contents are muffins. Through the plastic window, they look like muffins. But there seem to be many unknowns about this product that will never be answered. Who has made them, how far they travelled and the meanings of the lengthy words scrolled in the ingredients? We know this is a door from its shape, from its handle. But what is its particular purpose in being raised off the ground? Like the 21st century muffin bag, the door holds mystery.\n\nPerhaps the door’s raised status reflects the shop’s ego? We only have the best products, think twice if you are really of a high enough standing in society to step up and enter into this pace. Or maybe the simple step up and strain on the calf muscles adds to the overall journey. The unique experience of visiting this particular shop.\n\nI finally step back from the image and look once more at the name. Blomsterkiosk. Blume in German I know means flower. It starts to click. It is a bit all the above. The door is utilized in such a way to show that its products inside entice in passers-by with beauty and sent. They have mysterious origins flying in from all over the world. Only those with money to spare on fleeting, lavish items may enter. And it is part of a bigger journey, to a friend or loved one, to a celebration or ceremony, or to a sunlit windowsill. Perhaps it was not the building’s demanding presence nor the frame of the camera but the power held within this particular doorway.\n\nImage Reference\n\nOrganisation (Year that the page was published/last updated) Title of web page.

The following link to the blog article I am referring to. Link.\n\nI love the concept of your design, combining Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory and the historic hotel La Dimora di Metello. Beautiful sketches of the different aspects of the chocolate factory! I agree that the combination of the chocolate factory and the La Dimora di Metello made for an interesting foundation of your design concept.\n\nEarlier you mentioned that you like the La Dimora di Metello’s design as it communicated not only the surrounding area in the design but the traditions and history as well. How would you say your finished design include its surroundings and history?\n\nAlso, I like your process of looking at a design or inspiration and extracting and building upon the aspects you like. It reminds me of the book Steal Like an Artist by . It might be need to take the inspiration from Willy Wonka and add in some of the eccentricities in the design. Though I did note on the fun mask in your final design that I wouldn’t expect in a bathroom space which was a nice touch.\n\nThe idea of fermenting the wastes was an interesting idea and I should look more into the Lotus Toilet, LooWatt toilet or nano-membrane toilet. It would be interesting to see how it is used afterwards. Can it be funnelled into a container with a hose for outdoor garden use? Or if in an apartment is it collected for community use?\n\nIt would be interesting to expand on the conclusion. What were some of the questions that they asked you? And how exactly would you go about incorporating the infrastructure of the water system into the design? What are some of the possibilities you discussed?\n\nOn a formatting note, for the image I think Owan mentioned it is best to label an image:\n\nImage 1\n\nLa Dimora di Metello\n\nThen at the end of your article you can put an Image References section with the citation:\n\nSurname, Initial. (Year that the site was published/last updated) Title of web page. Available at: URL (Accessed: date).\n\nAnd finally, I enjoyed your concept and reading about your design process. All the images were beautiful to look at! Can I ask what your used to create your plan, axonometric and section drawings?\n\nIt was an interesting read, nice work! \n\nFor those of you who have seen Mel Brooks’ 1974 American comedy horror film, Young Frankenstein, you can probably see the wide eyes of Gene Wilder as he shocks some life into his monster creation. If not, here is a quick click to boost your memory.\n\nPerhaps there is something in the beauty, the solitude, or the cheese of Switzerland. The original Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus was written by Mary Shelly while in Switzerland in 1816. (History.com Editors (2009/2019) Fast forward to 2003 and we have a Swiss Architect, Peter Zumthor at the Wendlinghausen Castle giving a lecture to a room of 400 on how to inject life into your spaces.\n\nThe promise of a key to designing atmospheres with soul lures you in, very much like his architecture, providing you a slight direction in order to guide you towards designing impressionable spaces. And like Frankenstein’s monster, Peter Zumthor’s atmospheres are made of a compilation of parts, 12 to be exact. There are:\n\nBody of architecture (the makeup of materials)\n\nMaterial compatibility (how the materials work together)\n\nSound of space\n\nTemperature of a space\n\nSurrounding objects\n\nBetween composure & seduction\n\nTension between interior & interior\n\nLevels of intimacy\n\nThe lighting of things\n\nArchitecture as surroundings\n\nCoherence\n\nThe beautiful form\n\nAll of these pieces work together like the instruments in an orchestra to create one design language and evoke an emotional sensibility in the viewer.\n\nOur previous reading on In Praise of Shadows by J. Tanizaki reconfirmed the importance of the use of lighting and shadows in design. Zumthor takes it a step further, instructing on how to actually go about approaching the light in your spaces. He explains that lighting must be factored in from the beginning. He states “plan the building as a pure mass of shadow then, afterwards, to put in light as if you were hollowing out the darkness, as if the light were a new mass seeping in.” (Zumthor, p. 59) Then “to go about lighting materials and surfaces systematically and to look at the way they reflect the light.” (Zumthor, p. 59) This is advice that I will need to keep with me going forward in interior design.\n\nWhen looking at materials in Atmosphere, for me, the most significant ideas where to look at material compatibility as well in relation to proximity. And to not forget the endless possibilities within each material. As Zumthor states “Take stone. You can saw it, grind it, drill into it, split it, or polish it – it will become a different thing each time. Then take tiny amounts of the same stone, or huge amounts, and it will turn into something else again. Then hold it up to the light – different again. There are a thousand different possibilities in one material alone.” (Zumthor, p. 25) I find this important to challenge my thinking of materials especially when using biomaterials as I have in my projects which I can feel at times are limited as it is still new and not commonly applied to interiors spaces.\n\nReflecting back on the first project, the temporary live-work-play space, my problem was coherence. In the second project, window-scape, I began to think of lighting, sound and movement in my designs which improved my overall designs. In the third project, future bathroom, I lost the flow of movement with the final design and forgot to consider the temperature of the room until I had run out of time. Which is important in an intimate space. For this final project I will reflect back to the list explore how to add these ingredients to this unique design.\n\nIn the future I will work on creating this singular density in mood, beauty and harmony described by Zumthor as I continue to look for and develop my design language. The most challenging aspects for me will be learning to visualize the potential sound and temperature of my designed spaces and material compatibility. Hopefully, with the libraries’ eventual opening, I will have access to the material collections to advance this work further.\n\nReferences\n\nZumthor, P. (2006) Atmospheres.

It was designed in 1928 and the year of production was 1965. Originally called the infinitely adjustable lounge chair (chaise longue à réglage continu) or simply Chaise longue, it was later given the name B306 by Thonet and LC4 by Cassina in 1965. (Lombardi Borgia, no date)\n\nLike Corbusier’s buildings, the user is at the centre of the design. The weight of the chair, like his buildings, is supported by the centre, being raised on piers. This leaves the rest of the chair free to be shaped as desired. There is also very little separation between the exterior and interior. Just by looking at the chair we can see how it was made. There is no hidden interior system. This makes the design minimal, elegant through the curves but also raw. While his buildings brought the inhabitant light and freedom in their space, the LC4 was brought relaxation and comfort. The trio looked at the shape of the body for an ergonomic form with simple geometry. This can be seen in Charlotte Perriand’s words, “While our chair designs were directly related to the position of the human body… they were also determined by the requirements of architecture, setting, and prestige.” (Heals, 2020)\n\nThe material balances natural and industrial. The industrial being the steel and metal elements of the frame and the natural being the covering of the seat. The original chaise long was made from chrome-plated tubular steel, painted sheet metal, metal springs, rubber and horse-hide upholstery. Now the LC4 is trivalent chrome plated (CR3) tubular steel frame and black enamel steel base, polyester padding covered with either leather, pony skin, cow-skin or canvas. Though often pictured in black or cow-skin, the finishes are now offered in a range of colours.\n\nI have found two different chairs claiming to be the inspiration of the LC4. The first is the chair for the L’Esprit Nouveau pavilion pictured here as featured in the film Chair Times: A History of Seating: From 1800 to Today.\n\nThe second is the Thonet n. 7500 that appeared in the Centennial Exposition – Worlds Fair held in Philadelphia where Lombardi Borgia (no date) states there was also a version of the chair without armrests and with an upholstered seat.\n\nWhen first meeting this chair for time I was at underwhelmed after having heard so much about it. It was cold, sterile and probably created in collaboration with Edward Scissorhands and my dentist’s interior designer. But getting to know it further, I appreciated the clean lines and simple form that give it a timeless appeal along with the amount of thought that must have gone into it to make it both comfortable and adaptable for the user. I have since had the opportunity to sit in the chair, while I do have to agree it is a ‘relaxation machine’ of wonders. It is most comfortable chair I have tried, with only the Eames Lounge Chair coming in a close second. But how one could read in the chair without drifting to sleep is beyond me. I would say the functions range from unobstructed relaxation to sleeping.\n\nWhen speaking with a fellow classmate who studied product design we went further into discussion on why there is not a larger range of adjustable home furnishings. Her response was that in her practice she found that either the adjustments were not enough to notice, or if they were noticeable, they were either uncomfortable or the user would eventually find their preferred setting and never change it again. This is something that I would like to look into more in my future practice.\n\nI enjoy looking at the designs that combine beauty in lines and form. The seemingly simplistic design for some reason reminds me of that of the Cabbage Chair by Nendo’s designer Oki Sato. The Cabbage chair developed from the request of Japanese fashion designer, Issey Miyake who seeing too that too much paper was wasted from the factories, asked that Oki Sato design a chair from the rolls. After a series of cutting and peeling the chair emerged. Though being two entirely different chairs, I wonder if it is not possible to make a chair adjustable, with multiple functions but still an organic and simple beauty. Both the LC4 and the Cabbage Chair provide us new ways of relooking at something as basic as the classic chair.\n\nImage References\n\nImage 1\n\nChaise longue (2021) Available at: http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O34133/chaise-longue-le-corbusier/ (Accessed: 6 January 2021).\n\nImage 2\n\nCassina (2020) Available at: https://www.heals.com/blog/icons-lc4/ (Accessed: 2 December 2020).\n\nImage 3\n\nCassina (2020) Available at: https://www.heals.com/blog/icons-lc4/ (Accessed: 2 December 2020).\n\nImage 4\n\nChair Times: A History of Seating: From 1800 to Today (2018) Directed by Heinz Bütler [Feature film].

A land of mystery, depth, trance and human imperfection is craft fully depicted. And though he reveals the world around him that was the world of 1933, his words still resonates today.\n\nTanizaki is the perfect tour guide. He is quirky, energetic, nostalgic, and engrossed in the topic. His insights are personal and honest. (Perhaps even too honest at times.) While walking you through his tour, Tanizaki’s finds it best to not to only describe but to compare, contrasting his world with the Western world. In my review of this tour, I will be referring back to Tankizaki’s most esteemed example, the toilet. “Of all the elements of Japanese architecture, the toilet is the most aesthetic.” (Tanizaki, p. 70) An example of art in itself, it is a place for contemplation, writing poetry and reflecting on what makes the traditional atmospheres in Japan beautiful.\n\nThe Japanese toilet is a place for peace. It is made of natural materials away from the main house. From my studies of Japanese literature, I am in agreement with Tanizaki that the Japanese toilet is indeed a place where the greatest’s haikus could have been written by Japan’s top poets. The toilet experience was meant to be calm, in nature and on natural materials.\n\nThe Western idea of the toilet is at complete odds with the Japanese toilet of 1933. Where the Japanese toilet is quiet the Western toilet is loud, blaring shades of white enhanced by the glare of the ceramic. I would have to agree that I would not call the average western bathroom relaxing until the lights are low and it is bathed in candle light, usually during the beloved bubble bath time.\n\nTo sum it up, in Tanizaki’s description for the wooden Japanese toilet we see the descriptive words:\n\nTanizaki argues the aesthetics show its long history such as that what comes with tarnished silver over the years, “We love the colours and the sheen that calls to mind the past that made them.” (Tanizaki, p. 12) Tanizaki states. And like the overlaying of the years, there is an overlying of shadow casting inexpressible auras of depth. These shadows create “… a moment of mystery, a moment of trance.” (Tanizaki, p. 15) Shadows, which are so often overlooked. This appreciation extends even to the depth of silence as mentioned in his statement “…we prefer the soft voice, the understatement. Most important of all are the pauses.” (Tanizaki, p. 8) In this lighting you appreciate what is before you versus when dinning in a Western setting where its harsh lighting is shallow and has the ability to cut the appetite.\n\nTanizaki from the contrasting brightness to the materials that are used in the opposing styles of East and West. Wood versus ceramic and the upkeep involved in maintaining them. Though difficult to clean the wood provides its own depth and texture that could arguably outweigh the need for complete cleanliness. “The cleanliness of what can be seen only calls up the more clearly thought of what cannot be seen. In such places the distinction between the clean and unclean is best left obscure, shrouded in a dusky haze.” (Tanizaki, p. 5) Do we really want to see everything?\n\nAnd where do we draw the line between convenience and easy cleaning and keeping the soul of craft and tradition alive. In the battle of comforts of technology and the comforts of tradition, he states “A man who has a family and lives in the city cannot turn his back on the necessities of modern life – heating, electric lights, sanitary facilities – merely for the sake of doing things the Japanese way.” (Tanizaki, p.1) And yet the whole essay is a sigh of a last breath escaping a departing soul, an obituary to the Japanese aesthetic. If only things had been different he says, if only Japan had the advancements in science and technology first, how things would have been different. Had the Japanese designed the ink pen, he uses as an example, it would have had the ink seeping down into the hairs of the paint brush in black Indian ink.\n\nNow the technology of the toilet has far surpassed the Western toilets of the time, in 1933 and 2021. It is even more sterile than we could have ever imagined. It wipes, cleans, sprays, sanitizes, and scents the air! It even cleans the audio pollution with music or the sound of running water. Though there is no longer room for mystery or shadow, except maybe when trying to figure out how to use it.\n\nSo while there has been swings from one extreme to another I believe that there has been an endless effort to find balance. Balance in atmosphere. Combining the necessities with a feel of comfort, warms, and seclusion from the outside world. Modern designers are now using technology to bring designs back to nature, injecting emotion and a story into their pieces and lessening our impact on the planet. Design answers the challenge of our needs of space and our objects. And our needs all have a similar foundation. A need for soothing light, for familiarity, for comfort. Design has is achieving a balance of emotion, imperfection, story and function.\n\nFor me, a clear example where this is being achieved is with Designer Oki Sato’s designs. He is a modern designer that ensures each product is raw and tells a story. “I guess I am not really interested in colours or aesthetics but it’s the story behind the object. An object has to be talkative, it has to tell an interesting story. A project has to be environmentally friendly, it has to be user friendly.” (British GQ, 3:12) And like people, designs should not be perfect nor sterile. “I think technology is about making things flat and smooth and about making things perfect. And what makes people interesting is that people are not perfect. Perfection makes things boring in the end so I think the next step for technology is how to make them not smart but stupid in the end so they make pleasant mistakes.” (British GQ, 4:52)\n\nAnother example is Hiroshi Sambuichi’s installation within a former underground water reservoir in Copenhagen is another example where the existing beauty was enhanced by technology uniting the past with the present.\n\nIn my practice I need to continue to not put design into boxes and break away from this all or nothing, standard approach to thinking. Is about endlessly working to achieve a balance. Working with space so that it tells a story that will have a strong effect on you and entice you in to hear more. The importance of shadow and depth is often overlooked and should be included as we design-forward making the most of our spaces. Let’s not limit ourselves but blend needs and aesthetics. I will end with a final image that could attempt to blend the aesthetics of a Western and Japanese toilet.\n\nImage References\n\nImage 1\n\nSzczygiel, M. (2001/2016) From Night Soil to Washlet.

My thoughts brought me back to my undergraduate studies of Asian art and architecture. One of my first thoughts of being interested in the power of spatial design was when visiting a teahouse or chashitsu to practice chado, the Japanese tea ceremony. We approached the building that was modest and blending seamlessly with its surroundings. The entrance was a surprise to me.\n\nThe door or nijiriguchi was a third of my height (I am 183 cm or 6 feet). Daunted by the idea of squeezing into the space, I was surprised how crawling on all fours brought me to a new frame of mind and prepared me for my new surroundings. I later learned that this was to force the visitor to remove their weapons and to put their ego aside before entering the space. I was fascinated by this manipulation of space as well as how every aspect of the interior was done in such a way to heighten the experience of chado.\n\nAfter having pictured this architectural detail, we were asked to use it as an inspiration to create a mask/face covering. It was a light, icebreaker project, and was relevant to time as masks are now mandatory and a fact of daily life and Halloween was quickly approaching.\n\nWhen looking at the nijiriguchi, I worked to communicate its essence by incorporating the concepts of\n\n• genkan, an idea of elegant grace, gradually inviting you in and preparing you for a transition of spaces,\n\n• yugen, a sense of mystery, creating an unknown world, and\n\n• mindfulness, blurring the boundary of self and space.\n\nI was excited at how quickly the ideas evolved in the concept design stage. Changes flowed easily from idea to idea around restrictions of time and material. My first design was a kind of elementary science experiment, a reverse periscope. The only way to view the face in the mask would be to crouch down and view into the periscope. And even then, it would only be a reflection. It would create a physical separation from the interior and invite the viewer to gradually enter into the space (genkan) through a hall of mirrors. I went about this thinking of the functionality and looking at where to place any additional openings for lighting.\n\nWhile looking around for inspiration, I was surprised to see a similar mask that gave a new perspective to the mask wearer instead of the person trying to see through the mask.\n\nLacking any mirrors, the ideas evolved from a periscope to an isolated, straight hall, in which the viewer would need to look through to see the mask wear’s face.\n\nIn the designing phase, my preference leaned towards the sketches with circular forms and an idea of a completely latticed mask to further invite light in to cast endless shadows across the viewer’s face to create a sense of yugen, or mystery but not revealing the full image of the face. The shadows would blur the clean separation of space from the interior and exterior.\n\nIntimidation then took hold, as I peered at the cliff before me. Having no experience, I cursed my high school for having not offered woodworking classes in the past. The design was too complicated and time-consuming.\n\nI simplified the version, focusing instead on the play of light, inspired by the quote in Dr. Yoko Kawai’s presentation: “Contrast between light and shadow influences (the importance of healing). It stirs one’s imagination toward an unknown world, which makes one feel healed.” Taniguchi et al. 2003) I thus decided to construct it from gold material due to the gold’s mesmerizing reflection and to add additional light to contrast with the shadows produced by the lattice. I found a paper sphere template that I enlarged to match the expanse of the paper and was able to construct a sphere-like structure.\n\nAt the time of presentations, I felt surprised by the diversity and unique ideas expressed in the masks of my peers. I was intrigued to see the odd and inventive uses of reused materials. I remembered how important idea of sustainability is to me. It is my goal to look into all of my designs and ask what I can do at each step of the design process in order to make my spaces more ecological. If I could go back, I would like to look into achieving the same gold leaf appearance through other means, recycled gold and bronze items example.\n\nThe second highlight of the presentations was the array of forms that emerged through the masks. There were organic shapes achieving unpredictable waves and sharp echoing patterns of the 3-D folds. It was impressive how a simple architectural mask could draw a story out of you and speak of their designer’s emotions or experiences for them.\n\nI remember beginning the project and thinking how limited and unoriginal my designs were. Yet once the presentations were finished, I found my design unique. In addition, I was inspired by the vast spectrum of art created by my peers that was achieved with the same level of model making experience. Going forward, I will work towards not being afraid to sketch and show my sketches. I will look at everything for material ideas. I will be brave, encouraging myself to test model-making techniques. I will slowly tear at the mask of restrictions constructed for myself and view the infinite possibilities available to me.\n\nInteresting views of interior design from my peers:\n\n• Interior design is the colouring of architecture.\n\n• Interiors have more of a connection with human feeling.\n\nImage references\n\nImage 1\n\nNiriguchi (2001) Available at: http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nijiriguchi.htm (Accessed: 28 December 2020).\n\nImage 2\n\nAlamy Stock Photo (2010) Vintage 3d glasses.
