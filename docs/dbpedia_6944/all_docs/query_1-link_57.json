We have the beginning of the House of Hanover in England, the American Revolution in the British colonies, the founding of St. Petersburg in Russia, not to mention the beginnings of the Enlightenment in Europe. Yep, the first few decades of this century definitely lead up to a new era of worldviews.\n\nAs you go along, keep your eyes and ears open, ask questions and be curious.\n\nReady to listen to the era?

(Photo: Farnam Hall, Yale College; Credit: Nick Allen, Wikimedia Commons)\n\n______________________________\n\nNo Catholics Allowed!\n\nThe Act of Settlement is passed, formalizing the succession of the English throne to exclude all Catholics\n\nActually, this is interesting because George I (r. 1714-1727) was an elector of Hanover, meaning he got to be one of the ones who elected the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire [or the German king], and the Holy Roman Empire is the empire of Catholicism, so even though George became king of England, which was super anti-Catholic, he was very much tied to the pope and Catholicism\n\n______________________________\n\nNovember 12,Augustine Washington, future father of the first U.S. president, George Washington, turns 7; His father died three years ago; His mother has married a man named George Gale and they've all moved back to England\n\nNovember 21, Future French Enlightenment writer, historian and philosopher, Voltaire, turns 7\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession continues (1700-1714)\n\n1702\n\nRULERS & ROYALTY: William III and (II of Scotland) is king of England until March 8 when he dies and his sister-in-law, Queen Anne ascends the throne – Peter the Great (I) is the tsar of Russia – Philip V (French, Bourbon) is king of the Spanish Empire – Louie XIV is king of France – Fredrick I is king of Prussia (German Kingdom) – Leopold I is emperor of the Holy Roman/German Empire\n\nFebruary 6,Anne (who is just about to become queen of England) turns 37\n\n______________________________\n\nThe Next Prince of Orange?\n\nMarch 8, William III, king of England, (and also William II of Scotland), is thrown from his horse during a hunt at Hampton Court Palace and dies, aged 51, at Kensington Palace from complications resulting from a broken collarbone; He is succeeded by his sister-in-law and cousin, Anne who becomes queen of England\n\nBut, in addition to being King of England and Scotland, William III was also...\n\nWilliam, Prince of Orange\n\nWhy was he called the Prince of Orange? Because he was the sovereign of the Principality of Orange which has been a principality in Provence, France, since 1163 (currently, it is in the Netherlands, and Catherina-Amalia is the present-day princess of Orange)\n\nSince William dies without an heir, a dispute breaks out between his cousin Frederick I of Prussia (who just became the first king of Prussia last year) and John William Friso, a descendant of William's brother\n\nJohn eventually wins the fight and gains the title (though oddly King Fredrick I of Prussia keeps the territory) and becomes the next Prince of Orange at 14 years-old\n\n______________________________\n\nApril 23, The coronation of Queen Anne takes place at Westminster Abbey\n\n______________________________\n\nQueen Anne's War\n\nQueen Anne’s War (1702-1713) begins in America, it is the second in a series of French and Indian Wars fought in North America; It's primarily a conflict between French, Spanish and English colonists for...\n\n...control of the American continent...\n\nwith each side allied to various Native American tribes; In the south, Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at Fort Louis de la Louisiane (near present-day Mobile, Alabama), with allied Native Americans on both sides (Wikipedia)\n\n______________________________\n\nMarch 21, Future German composer Johann Sebastian Bach turns 18\n\nNovember 12,Augustine Washington, future father of the first U.S. president, George Washington, turns 8;

Berlin has always been a major city in that Dukedom, but now that Prussia is a Kingdom, Berlin is its capital; Pictured below is the Hohenzollern family's residence in Berlin in 1702 (Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\n1703\n\nRULERS & ROYALTY: Anne is queen of England – Peter I \"The Great\" is tsar of Russia – Philip V (French, Bourbon) is emperor of the Spanish Empire – Louis XIV is king of France – Fredrick I is king of Prussia – Leopold I is emperor of the Holy Roman/German Empire\n\nFebruary 6,Queen Anne of England turns 38\n\nMarch 21, German composer Johann Sebastian Bach turns 19\n\n_____________________________\n\nThe Founding of St. Petersburg\n\nMay 27, Perter I \"The Great\" establishes the city of St. Petersburg, on the site of a captured Swedish fortress (St. Petersburg's name was changed to Leningrad between 1924-1991, it is now the second largest city in Russia);

People currently living in the colony surely had grandfathers and great grandfathers who remembered settling there and helped build the town themselves; Back in 1624, King James I of England revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made the Virginia Colony a crown colony, meaning it is now administered by The Crown, not by a company; Later in the 1680s, King Charles II nicknamed the Virginia Colony \"The Old Dominion\" because of its loyalty to The Crown of England; This is where George Washington's dad is growing up, and Later George Washington himself;
