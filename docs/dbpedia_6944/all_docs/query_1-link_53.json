In 962, Karl's grandson, Otto I of Germany was re-crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope John XII, thus giving the German kings once again claim to the title \"Holy Roman Emperor.\" From this time forward, the German kings would continually claim the right to rule this central European empire.\n\n| Top of the page | The Holy Roman Empire | Prussian Flags Before 1800 | Prussian Flags 1800-1892 |\n\n| Prussian Flags After 1900 | Imperial Germany Era Flags | German Colonial Flags | Weimar Republic Era Flags |\n\n| Third Reich Era Civil and Political Flags | Third Reich Era Military Flags | Modern Era Flags |\n\nFlags of the Prussia - Before 1800\n\nAmong the groups of knights organized during the Crusades (e.g Templars, Hospitallers) was a group, largely German, called the Deutscher Orden (German Order), or Teutonic Knights. In 1225, after the failure to reconquer the Holy Land, Pope Gregory IX ordered the Teutonic Knights to convert the Prussians, a people related to the Lithuanians and Latvians, and who were the last remaining pagans in Europe. This historic event would start Prussia on the road to empire and the process of forming a new Germanic empire. By 1701, Prussia became a kingdom and from then until 1871, it was in a continuous stage of expansion until it came to be by far the largest German state, almost as large as all the others together, and the neclus of the Second Reich.\n\n| Top of the page | The Holy Roman Empire | Prussian Flags Before 1800 | Prussian Flags 1800-1892 |\n\n| Prussian Flags After 1900 | Imperial Germany Era Flags | German Colonial Flags | Weimar Republic Era Flags |\n\n| Third Reich Era Civil and Political Flags | Third Reich Era Military Flags | Modern Era Flags |\n\nFlags of the Prussia 1800-1892\n\nAt the end of the Napoleonic wars, a paranoid Imperial Russia and an aging Hapsburg-dominated Austria and Hungary made sure they were protected from any future French menace by placing 38 small Germanic buffer states between France and themselves at the Congress of Vienna in 1816. While this reassuring Russia and Austria, it made the small German buffer states a bit nervous, and this combined with the dreams of a second Reich, led to a slow, but sure process of unification within what eventually became known as the \"Confederation of the Rhine\" under the leadership of Brandenburg/Prussia.\n\n| Top of the page | The Holy Roman Empire | Prussian Flags Before 1800 | Prussian Flags 1800-1892 |\n\n| Prussian Flags After 1900 | Imperial Germany Era Flags | German Colonial Flags | Weimar Republic Era Flags |\n\n| Third Reich Era Civil and Political Flags | Third Reich Era Military Flags | Modern Era Flags |\n\nFlags of the Prussia Since 1900\n\nDuring the beginning of the 20th Century Prussia was the heart of the Second Reich, and then with the defeat of Imperial Germany, a part of the Weimar Republic, until the rise of the Third Reich. Since the end of World War II the lands of Prussia have been divided between Poland and Germany. Germany itself was divided into East and West until 1992.\n\n- My thanks to \"Fornax\" for all his expert help, research, advise, and images used on this page - | Top of the page | The Holy Roman Empire | Prussian Flags Before 1800 | Prussian Flags 1800-1892 |\n\n| Prussian Flags After 1900 | Imperial Germany Era Flags | German Colonial Flags | Weimar Republic Era Flags |\n\n| Third Reich Era Civil and Political Flags | Third Reich Era Military Flags | Modern Era Flags |"
