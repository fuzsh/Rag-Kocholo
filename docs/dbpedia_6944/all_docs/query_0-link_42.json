        "text": "Most writers have taken Frederick II at his word and interpreted his sparse and generally derogatory comments about the Holy Roman Empire as indications of its low priority in Prussian policy after 1740. This article offers a reappraisal, based on a re-examination of his writings and his policy towards the Empire and its principal dynasties. Despite his distaste for the imperial constitution, Frederick swiftly appreciated its significance to his goals of security and international recognition. Certainly, relations with the imperial Estates remained secondary to diplomatic and military engagement with Austria and the other major European powers. Nonetheless, the Empire remained more than an arena in which Austro-Prussian rivalry was played out. The imperial constitution offered a means to neutralize threats to Prussia's more vulnerable provinces and a framework to constrain Habsburg ambitions, while ties to minor German dynasties offered avenues to maintain or improve relations with Europe's leading monarchies that were likewise bound within the elite kinship of the Christian old world. For this to be effective, however, Frederick had to engage in all aspects of imperial politics and not just representation in formal institutions.\n\n15 This provides one of the many interesting comparisons between Frederick and Joseph II whose efforts to adopt French as the Habsburg diplomatic language in 1789 was fiercely opposed by Kaunitz who maintained that German was the appropriate medium to deal with the Empire: Aretin, Heiliges Römisches Reich, i, p. 17. See also V. Wittenauer, Im Dienste der Macht: Kultur und Sprache am Hof der Hohenzollern vom Großen Kurfürst bis zu Wilhelm II. (Paderborn, 2007).\n\n19 See ibid., pp. 255–62, for Frederick's thoughts on princely education. His instructions for that of his two successors are in G. B. Volz, ed., Die Werke Friedrichs des Großen (10 vols., Berlin, 1912–14; reprint Braunschweig, 2006), vii, pp. 204–9. The Miroir [sic] des princes presented to Carl Eugen in Feb. 1744 is a hastily compiled selection of sentiments already expressed in his Anti-Machiavel. The former is printed in Volz, ed., Werke, vii, pp. 200–3. For the duchy's own education programme, see E. Schneider, ‘Herzog Karl Eugen: Erzeihung, Jugend und Persönlichkeit’, in Herzog Karl Eugen und seine Zeit (issued by the Württembergischer Geschichts- und Altertumsverein, 2 vols., Esslingen, 1907–9), i, pp. 25–8, 31–7.\n\n61 A.

Koss, eds., Patriotismus und Nationasbildung am Ende des Heiligen Römischen Reiches (Cologne, 2003), pp. 19–61; H. Schulze, The course of German nationalism from Frederick the Great to Bismarck (Cambridge, 1990); E. Hellmuth, ‘A monument to Frederick the Great: architecture, politics and the state in late eighteenth-century Prussia’, in J. Brewer and E. Hellmuth, eds., Rethinking the Leviathan (Oxford, 1999), pp. 317–41, and his ‘Die “Wiedergeburt” Friedrichs des Großen und der “Tod fürs Vaterland”: Zum patriotischen Selbsverständnis in Preußen in der zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts’, Aufklärung, 10 (1998), pp. 23–54.\n\n62 C. Jany, Geschichte der preußischen Armee vom 15. Jahrhundert bis 1914 (4 vols., Berlin, 1928–9; reprint Osnabrück, 1967), ii, pp. 3–12, 49–56, 76–88. The augmentation increased the army from 76,278 just prior to Frederick's accession to 134,910 at the conclusion of peace in 1745. The regimental numbering system follows that used by H. Bleckwenn, Die friderizianischen Uniformen, 1753–1786 (4 vols., Osnabrück, 1987). At the time, units were still known by their colonels' names.\n\n64 None of the Württembergers exercised command in person, though there is evidence that Maria Augusta at least corresponded about some aspects of her regiment's internal management: Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart (hereafter HSAS), g197 Bü. 19. For her, see P. H. Wilson, ‘Women and imperial politics: the Württemberg consorts, 1674–1757’, in C. Campbell-Orr, ed., Queenship in Europe, 1660–1815: the role of the consort (Cambridge, 2004), pp. 221–51 at pp. 240–6. See also D. Hohrath, ‘“Verwandte – Feinde – Vorbilder”: Aspekte der militärischen Beziehungsgeschichte Preußens und Württembergs im 18. Jahrhundert’, in J. Luh et al., eds., Preussen, Deutschland und Europa, 1701–2001 (Groningen, 2003), pp. 385–98. For other members of the ducal house mentioned here, see S. Lorenz, ed., Das Haus Württemberg (Stuttgart, 1997).\n\n68 Ludwig Eugen married Sophie Albertine (1728–1807) in 1762 who, as countess of Beichlingen, was deemed by her brothers-in-law as unequal in status. Ludwig Eugen became involved with the Austrian Archduchess Marie Christine (1742–98) and had to leave Vienna in 1766. He agreed to back the claims of Friedrich Eugen's children as part of a family reconciliation. The archduchess meanwhile married Albert von Sachsen-Teschen (1732–1822). For Friedrich Eugen, see P. Stark, Fürstliche Personen des Hauses Württemberg und ihre bewährten Diener im Zeitalter Friedrichs des Großen (Stuttgart, 1876), esp. pp. 43–51.\n\n77 The Schwedts descended from the Great Elector's second marriage to Dorothea von Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1636–89) in 1668. The line lasted until 1788. Examples of Hohenzollern–Schwedt intermarriage include Frederick's sister Sophie (1719–65) who married Friedrich Wilhelm of B.-Schwedt (1700–57), and his brother Ferdinand (1730–1813) who married Luise of B.-Schwedt (1738–1820). Frederick I had arranged the marriage of Elisabeth Sophie of B.-Schwedt (1674–1748) to the Hohenzollern Margrave Christian Ernst of Bayreuth (1644–1712, r. 1655) to stop him slipping too far into an Austrian orbit in 1703.\n\n87 T. Biskup, ‘The hidden queen: Elisabeth Christine of Prussia and Hohenzollern queenship’, in Orr, ed., Queenship, pp. 300–21. Ferdinand Albrecht II of Braunschweig-Bevern (1680–1735) inherited Wolfenbüttel when the ruling Dannenberg line died out in 1735. He died six months later and was followed by his eldest son, Carl I, while his younger son, Ernst Ferdinand (1682–1746) was given Bevern, establishing a new line running through his sons August Wilhelm (1715–81) and Friedrich Karl Ferdinand (1729–1809). After the latter's death, the line was established again for offspring of Duke Carl II Wilhelm Ferdinand of Wolfenbüttel, the Prussian field marshal, and lasted until 1884."
