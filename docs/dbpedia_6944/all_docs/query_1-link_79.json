This is particularly troe in the pre and post Charlemagne period. Probably since the death of protestant William III in 1702, it has been possible in Britain to ignore the monarch – the real story lies with parliament and a network of soldiers and businessmen. In Germany this is not the case. Some of the hundreds of rulers dealt with very small territories in which they could do as they liked, sometimes creating brilliant courts without which European culture makes little sense. Others were substantial, commanded great armies and settled the fate of millions. A slice through any given month in Germany’s history could turn up to a staggering array of rulers.\n\nMost historians consider the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire to be a process that started with the split of the Frankish realm in the Treaty of Verdun in 843, continuing the Carolingian dynasty independently in all three sections. The eastern part fell to Louis the German, who was followed by several leaders until the death of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian in the eastern part.\n\nHenry (Heinrich) I the Fowler (r. 919–936), a Saxon designated his son Otto to be his successor, who was elected King in Aachen in 936. A marriage alliance with the widowed queen of Italy gave Otto control over that nation as well. His later crowning as Emperor Otto I (later called “the Great”) in 962 would mark an important step, since from then on the Empire – and not the West-Frankish kingdom that was the other remainder of the Frankish kingdoms – would have the blessing of the Pope.\n\nAs opposed to the rulers of the West Frankish lands, which later became France, the Emperors never managed to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, Emperors were forced to grant more and more powers to the individual dukes in their respective territories.\n\nThe glory of the Empire almost collapsed in the Investiture Controversy, in which Pope Gregory VII declared a ban on King Henry IV (king 1056, Emperor 1084–1106). Although this was taken back after the 1077 Walk to Canossa, the ban had wide-reaching consequences. Meanwhile, the German dukes had elected a second king, Rudolf of Swabia, whom Henry IV could only defeat after a three-year war in 1080. The mythical roots of the Empire were permanently damaged; the German king was humiliated. Most importantly though, the church became an independent player in the political system of the Empire.\n\nFrom the 13th century onwards, the prince-electors had the privilege of electing the monarch who would be crowned by the pope. Consequently, rebellion fomented by nobles was nearly constant. Charles V (elected in 1519) was the last emperor to be crowned (1530); his successors were elected emperors by the electoral college, each being titled “Elected Emperor of the Romans.”\n\nBy the 16th century, the Holy Roman Empire had become an elective monarchy headed by a person styled as the Roman Emperor and King in Germany. His authority was recognized in the territories of the modern Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Liechtenstein, and in some territories that now belong to France, Poland, Italy, and other neighboring countries. Practically, the Empire had become a loose confederation of over 1800 autonomous territories.\n\nThis process culminated in constant wars between different owners of land and continued up until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Several attempts were made to reverse this degradation of the Reich’s former glory, but failed.\n\nSince the 13th century, the central Imperial government grew weak, and local authorities gradually established real political control over their territories known as Territorial Supremacy. Territorial Supremacy could belong to a duke, a bishop, a count, a city council, an abbess, a knight, or any other local authority that possessed the Imperial immediacy, the direct jurisdiction of the Empire. The only feudal overlord of an Imperial immediate territory was the Roman Emperor. After the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the right of Territorial Supremacy carried many attributes of sovereignty; however, governments of immediate territories legally recognized the Imperial suzerainty.\n\nIn order to solve the problem that the emperor was (after the Investiture Controversy) no longer as able to use the church as a mechanism to maintain power, the Staufer increasingly lent land to ministerialia, formerly unfree service men, which Frederick hoped would be more reliable than local dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later knights, another basis of imperial power.\n\nAnother new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities, both by the emperor and the local dukes. These were partly due to the explosion in population, but also to concentrate economic power at strategic locations, while formerly cities only existed in the shape of either old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include Freiburg, possibly the economic model for many later cities, and Munich.\n\nWhile Frederick brought the mythical idea of the Empire to a last highpoint, he was also the one to initiate the major steps that led to its disintegration. On the one hand, he concentrated on establishing an – for the times – extraordinarily modern state in Sicily, with public services, finances, and jurisdiction. On the other hand, Frederick was the emperor who granted major powers to the German dukes in two far-reaching privileges that would never be reclaimed by the central power. In the 1220 Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis, Frederick basically gave up a number of regalia in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, jurisdiction and fortification. The 1232 Statutum in favorem principum mostly extended these privileges to the other (non-clerical) territories (Frederick II was forced to give those privileges by a rebellion of his son, Henry). Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German dukes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick wanted to concentrate on his homelands in Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called domini terrae, owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\nThe long decline\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which gave the territories almost complete sovereignty, even allowing them to form independent alliances with other states, the Empire was only a mere conglomeration of largely independent states. By the rise of Louis XIV of France, the Holy Roman Empire as such had lost all power and clout in major European politics. The Habsburg emperors relied more on their role as Austrian archdukes than as emperors when challenged by Prussia, portions of which were part of the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts. From 1792 onwards, revolutionary France was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently. The Empire was formally dissolved on August 6, 1806 when the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French Army under Napoleon (see Treaty of Pressburg). Napoleon reorganized much of the empire into the Confederation of the Rhine. This ended the so-called First Reich.\n\nmm\n\nExpansion of early Germanic tribes from 700 BC to 1 AD\n\nFrom Rhine to Elbe to Oder to Vistula to Volga and Danube\n\nThis\n\nMigration of German tribes\n\nGermania\n\nGermany during the Roman Empire 1-450 AD\n\nGermany after the fall of Roman empire 450 – 800 AD\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire (800 – 1815)\n\nCharlemagne (800-814)\n\nKingdom of East Francia ( xxx)\n\n1648, Treaty of Westphalia: Switzerland won independence from the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nDissolution of Holy Roman Empire in 1806\n\nMap of the Holy Roman Empire in 1790\n\nFormation of The German Confederation at the Congress of Vienna 1815\n\nThe German revolutions of 1848–1849\n\nBismarck and German Unification\n\nThe German Revolution 1918-1919\n\nThe First World War\n\nThe Second World War 1939\n\nThe Nineteenth Century\n\nEclipse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806\n\nThe Empire and people in modern Germany 1806-1939\n\nThe Vienna Settlement 1815\n\nOtto von Bismarck 1871 – 1890\n\nThe Franco-Prussian War 1870-71\n\nUnification of Germany\n\n16 states of Germany\n\nThe Twentieth Century\n\nThe First World War 1914-18\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles 1919\n\nNext\n\nThe Weimar Republic 1918–1933\n\nThe Third Reich 1933-45\n\nThe Second World War\n\nThe Roman Germania 1 BC\n\nThe Latin name Germania means “land of the Germani”, but the etymology of the name Germani itself is uncertain. During the Gallic Wars of the 1st century BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar encountered peoples originating from beyond the Rhine. He referred to these people as “Germani” and their lands beyond the Rhine as “Germania”. In subsequent years, the Roman emperor Augustus sought to expand across the Rhine towards the Elbe, but these efforts were hampered by the victory of Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. However, territories east of the Rhine remained independent of Roman control. up until 200 AD.\n\nCharlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843. The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps. Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies. In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[35] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, or the Reformed faith as their official religion. The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet. The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI’s daughter Maria Theresa ruled as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I, became Emperor.\n\nGermany 50 BC\n\nThe two main types of “Germani” in the time of Julius Caesar. Later Roman imperial provinces shown with red shading. On the Rhine are Germania Inferior (north) and Germania Superior (south). (See map between Elbe and Oder)\n\nGermany 1 BC under Empire Tiberius: Expanding between Rhine and Elbe Rivers\n\nMagna Germania: Germany 125 AD\n\nArea between Elbe and Oder Rivers: Berlin\n\nRiver Elbe divides the old West and East Germany. The area east of River Elbe that was “non-Romanized” is East Germany that contains Berlin, the capital of Nazi Germany. It also contains Wittenberg from where the Protestant Reformation started. Finally, this area was culturally very different from areas west of Elbe.\n\nRiver Elbe: How a German river marks cultural divide between east and west\n\nThe main historical cultural boundary within Germany has been for centuries between the parts that used to be occupied by the Romans, and the parts that weren’t. Which roughly translates to a North/South boundary (along river Elbe) , rather than East/West. BTW, in this context, Austria should be considered part of Germany’s south; it is a separate country only due to a historic accident. This boundary was frequently reinforced by wars, and the resulting enmities, such as the war between Prussia and Bavaria that still kindles resentments between these two regions.\n\nThe 18th century saw the rise of the state of Prussia and the violent threat of the French\n\nRevolution and Napoleonic Wars, which revealed the weaknesses of Germany but led to a widespread growth of national feeling. Unfortunately the Congress of Vienna militated against the growth of unity. The rivalry between Prussia and Austria prevented the growth of any federation that might have led to a unified state.The revolutions of 1948 turning point for Germany during which the Germans failed to turn toward democratic government and create a successful unified state based on a liberal constitution. In the end it was the authoritarian Prussian Junker Bismarck who set himself the task of destroying liberalism in order to strengthen conservative Prussia and maintain its position as a great power.\n\nPrussia and Prussianism eventually triumphed over the rest of Germany, which was more passive, liberal, and good-natured. Bismarck and Prussia impressed on the Germans a spirit of militarism and the Machiavellian doctrine of the reason of the reason of state which justified every infringement of written and unwritten law. These were qualities that found even greater expression in the leadership of Adolf Hitler. The cleavages continued after WW II as West and East Germany were divided between a democratic Federal Republic and a communist German Democratic Republic. Today the Germans are still trying to bridge those differences since they were reunified in 1990.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire\n\nIt was the German emperor Otto I (r. 962–73) who, by military conquest and astute political policy, placed the territorial empire of Charlemagne under German rule and established in Central Europe the feudal state that would be called, by the thirteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAfter 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the German kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy (after 951), Bohemia (after 1004) and Burgundy (after 1032).\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the convention was that the (elected) king of Germany was also Emperor of the Romans. From the time of Otto’s coronation until the official dissolution of the empire in 1806, the imperial title was held almost exclusively by German monarchs and, for nearly four centuries, by members of a single family.\n\nEnd of the Holy Roman Empire 1806\n\nAlthough the empire defended itself quite well initially, war with France and Napoleon proved catastrophic. In 1804, Napoleon proclaimed himself as the Emperor of the French, which Francis II responded to by proclaiming himself the Emperor of Austria, in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor, an attempt at maintaining parity between France and Austria while also illustrating that the Holy Roman title outranked them both. Austria’s defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805 and the secession of a large number of Francis II’s German vassals in July 1806 to form the Confederation of the Rhine, a French satellite state, effectively meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The abdication in August 1806, combined with a dissolution of the entire imperial hierarchy and its institutions, was seen as necessary to prevent the possibility of Napoleon proclaiming himself as Holy Roman Emperor, something which would have reduced Francis II to Napoleon’s vassal."
