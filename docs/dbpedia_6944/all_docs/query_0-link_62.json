        "text": "This essay places Eugen Ehrlich and Hans Kelsen afresh in their common context, the late Habsburg Empire. It reframes Ehrlich's legal sociology and Kelsen's pure theory of law as co-original and connected responses to the problem of legal universals under conditions of fractured sovereignty and imperial diversity. At first glance, Kelsen and Ehrlich seem antipodes, an impression apparently confirmed by their prickly exchange in the 1910s: while Kelsen made universality reside in the formal features and sequences of imputation that held the normative order together, Ehrlich claimed that every normative system which purported to be meta-social and meta-cultural merely camouflaged its local conditions of emergence. Once resituated in their Habsburg environment, these strategies can be read as articulations of a broader set of common proclivities. Ehrlich's and Kelsen's proficiency in the empire's techniques of plurality management enabled them to demystify the state and to dismantle the nation: both perceived the state as a juristic construction, hence they unmasked its alleged social, cultural, and ontological unity as a delusion. The same held true for the nation: Ehrlich challenged its supremacy by showing that social relationships-\"associations\"-cut across national divides, while Kelsen delegitimized the nation's status as a rights-bearing collective and blurred the distinction between citizens and alien residents, working toward the civic enfranchisement of the latter. This dovetailed with Ehrlich's and Kelsen's unmaking of the distinction between private and public law: the false belief in the latter's superiority over the former served to license arbitrary rule. Both jurists deterritorialized state sovereignty by highlighting the brittleness of spatial dominion and the artificiality of political boundaries: Ehrlich and Kelsen discovered a gamut of sovereign authorities with overlapping spatial areas of jurisdiction that coexisted within the Habsburg polity. This in turn permitted them to effectively transcend the distinction between domestic and international law: while, according to Ehrlich, the state fizzled out on the local level, Kelsen redescribed it from a global perspective, turning it into a mere subordinate organ of world law. Ehrlich's legal pluralism and Kelsen's pure theory were the two most successful juristic legacies of the Habsburg polity whose imprint they bore. Both creatively reworked Habsburg constitutional reality into templates of legal order that survived the empire's demise.

Revisionist scholarship has since uncovered the empire&#39;s modern afterlife as a model for federative political order and archetype of the greater German (großdeutsche) nation. This article identifies a different kind of legacy, by examining the empire&#39;s role in shaping the constitutional configuration of an individual successor state – Prussia. In a debate over Prussia&#39;s unwritten historical constitution unfolding in the 1840s, narratives of the empire&#39;s constitutional history became the basis on which the juridical structure of the kingdom&#39;s sovereignty was negotiated by jurists and political actors. These included, among others, King Frederick William IV and his brother William, the leaders of the German historical school of jurisprudence Savigny and Eichhorn, and the Prussian statesman Kamptz. The ...\n\nNotions such as 'states-system' and 'international system' are central to IR. Yet, they have been neglected in our study of conceptual history. This paper focuses on the 17th-century debate about the status of the Holy Roman Empire as a political unit. During that time, several key figures of political philosophy such as Althusius, Pufendorf and Leibniz attempted to theorise the Empire and, in the process, the term 'states-system' was employed as a category of analysis. Althusius pioneered integration theory and proposed federalism as a description of the historical and legal formation of the Empire. Pufendorf did not find any relevance in the existing categories and argued that the Empire was \"a monster\", but almost a 'states-system'. Leibniz rejected Pufendorf's solution and claimed that the Empire was a federal union. In conclusion it is argued that, although they were discussing the same object, the three thinkers substantially differed in their analyses because of their own commitments to distinct philosophical systems. All three contributions are extremely relevant to the understanding of both IR as a discipline and our current political reality.\n\nArgumentation intervenes both in the management of the ordinary activities of an organization and during special circumstances that raise important and critical issues, such as when a crisis creates the exigence of defending the reputation and image of the institution. As a matter of fact, argumentation is at work in the establishment of the institution itself. The creation of an institution entails an argumentative speech act by which the rationale for such an institution is given. Indeed, institutions are not created by chance but in view of a purpose which represents their raison d’être. In this paper, we intend to explore more in depth such a constitutive function of argumentation by examining its role in the discursive acts that human beings perform in order to give birth to an institutional entity. As a case in point, we analyze the Foedus Pactum Helveticum, the 1291 Charter that is at the origin of the Swiss Confederation. We analyze the Foedus Pactum from a semantic-pragmatic point of view, interpreting this document as a complex connection of speech acts, which contribute to fulfill the overarching aim of the document, broadly corresponding to what the writer aims at doing to the reader (Rigotti 1993; Rigotti and Rocci 2001, 2006). From this perspective, we consider in particular the sequences fulfilling an argumentative function.\n\nWhat is it that makes a people? What is the identity of a nation? The question has been asked by philosophers, sociologists and lawyers ever since the birth of the modern nation-state. This contribution highlights an aspect of this debate: it discusses the commonly mentioned requirement of a certain homogeneity of the people of a nation. It tells the story of the requirement during the Weimar Republic and in our times, drawing on studies in behavioral and cognitive science to argue that it is not the absence of a common tie, but its arbitrariness that makes homogeneity a meaningless criterion."
