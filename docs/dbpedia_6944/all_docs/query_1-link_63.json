        "text": "From The Emperor’s Desk: In 1888 German Emperor Friedrich III ascended the Imperial throne. For a short while he was hesitant in deciding what to call himself. At first he wanted to call himself German Emperor Friedrich IV.\n\nI always found that strange and wondered if the new emperor really understood his history? But through the years my mind has been changed and now as I think about it, desiring to call himself Friedrich IV tpwas not a strange idea whatsoever.\n\nThis blog entry will be discussing how calling himself Emperor Friedrich IV was plausible and I will design the historical precedence behind it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn 1871, following Prussia’s victories, the German states were united into the German Empire, with King Wilhelm I of Prussia as the German Emperor and Crown Prince Friedrich as heir-apparent to the Kingdom of Prussia and the new German Empire.\n\nThree days after Crown Prince Friedrich was confirmed to be suffering, and dying from laryngeal cancer in early March of 1888, his father, German Emperor Wilhelm I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on March 9,1888, upon which Friedrich became German Emperor and King of Prussia.\n\nHis son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news of the death of German Emperor Wilhelm I to his father in Italy where he was convalescing from his illness. Later the same day, Friedrich wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, “…and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser!\n\nLogically, Friedrich could have taken as his regnal name as German Emperor Friedrich I, if the German Empire created by Chancellor Otto von Bismark was considered a new entity. Generally, though not always, when a monarch adopts a new title a new numbering system will begin. For example, in my previous blog post, Margrave Friedrich IV of Meissen, when he became Prince-Elector of Saxony, he adopted the name Friedrich I of Saxony.\n\nThe new German Emperor wanted to call himself Friedrich IV as he considered this new Empire a continuation of the old Holy Roman Empire, which previously had three emperors named Friedrich. This was the style and title he himself preferred to be called as he did view this new Empire as an extension of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.\n\nHowever, on the advice of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, he stated that this would create legal problems, and it was suggested that he opt to simply keep as his Imperial style and name the same regnal name he had as King of Prussia, which was King Friedrich III.\n\nIt is here where I questioned the emperor’s knowledge of History. I saw the German Empire created in 1871 by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck as a completely new entity separate from the old Holy Roman Empire. While this was the case, this was an entirely new Empire, I have come to see that wanting to give himself a regnal name of Friedrich IV and connecting himself to the old Empire did have its precedence.\n\nThere have been kingdoms and empires in the past where Regnal names and numbers were maintained from older States and transferred to newer States. Here are some examples.\n\nI will begin with Spain.\n\nIn 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of their monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and Fernando II of Aragon, respectively. The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon is often considered the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each Kingdom of Spain remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language.\n\nIn other words, the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon we’re in a personal Union with the monarch and not politically united.\n\nOn Fernando II’s death in 1516, his grandson was proclaimed as King Carlos I of Castile and of Aragon (in authority) jointly with his mother Joanna I as the Queen of Castile (in name). As the first monarch to reign over Castile and Aragon, King Carlos I may be considered as the first operational “King of Spain.” King Carlos I also became Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire in 1519.\n\nKing Carlos was the first king to officially use a derivation of the name “Spain” as the name of the realm. He also used Rex Hispaniarum et Indiarum (i.e. King of the Spains and the Indies). This title was often used after his title of Holy Roman Emperor which was superior to that of king.\n\nDespite the personal Union of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon the numbering system for its monarchs maintained the numbering system used in Castile. For example, King Fernando II of Aragon is often referred to as King Fernando V of Castile, even though his sovereignty was by the right of his wife.\n\nThe next Spanish ruler with the name of Fernando continued the Castilian numbering system and became King Fernando VI of Spain.\n\nThis system was tested when King Alfonso XII became king. On June 25, 1870, Infante Alfonso was recalled to Paris, where his mother Queen Isabella II of Spain abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to those of the exiled Queen.\n\nHe assumed the name King Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name “Alfonso”, the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of Asturias, León and Castile also named Alfonso.\n\nThe various Spanish states were not formally administered as a single unit, the Kingdom of Spain, but as separate political units under the same monarchs. The legal merging of Aragon and Castile into a single Spain occurred under King Felipe V in 1707–1715. The name Felipe is another example where the numbering of the monarch stayed consistent despite the change of the name of the state.\n\nArchduke Phillipp of Austria, reigning Duke of burgundy became King of Castile by right of his wife Queen Joanna of Castile. And in Castile he is known as King Felipe I. His grandson, Infante Felipe, when he became King of Spain he continued the Castilian numbering system by becoming King Felipe II of Spain.\n\nTherefore, despite there being many monarchs over the changing status of various Spanish States the numbering system remained consistent with that of the ancient Kingdom of Castile.\n\nTo continue my series on what language to use while writing the blog I want to discuss how I use German titles.\n\nHere is a list of titles in German and thier English equivalent.\n\nKaiser and Kaiserin (Emperor and Empress)\n\nKönig and Königin (King and Queen)\n\nGroßherzog and Großherzogin (Grand Duke and Grand Duchess)\n\nHerzog and Herzogin (Duke and Duchess)\n\nPrinz and Prinzessin (Prince and Princess)\n\nI don’t use any of these German translations of titles. I only use English.\n\nIt does create an unusual mixture. I will use Louis IV of Hesse and by Rhine, the son-in-law of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom for my example.\n\nGenerally when reading a book about this German Prince his name and title will be rendered in English as Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nIn German it’s Großherzog Ludwig IV von Hessen und bei Rhein.\n\nI will use German for his name but English for the title: Grand Duke Ludwig IV of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nI want to give a little background on the title German Emperor which in German is: Deutscher Kaiser.\n\nThe title German Emperor was the official title of the head of state and hereditary ruler of the German Empire. A specifically chosen term, it was introduced with the January 1, 1871 constitution and lasted until the official abdication of Wilhelm II on November 9, 1918.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor is sometimes also called “German Emperor” when the historical context is clear, as derived from the Holy Roman Empire’s official name of “Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation” from 1512.\n\nGerman Empire (1848–49)\n\nIn the wake of the revolutions of 1848 and during the German Empire (1848–49), King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia was offered the title “Emperor of the Germans” which is translated Kaiser der Deutschen in German.\n\nThis title was offered to the Prussian King by the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849, but the King declined it because he didn’t believe the title was “not the Parliament’s to give”. King Friedrich Wilhelm IV believed that only the German princes had the right to make such an offer, in accordance with the traditions of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nCreation\n\nThe title German Emperor was carefully chosen by Otto von Bismarck, Minister President of Prussia and Chancellor of the North German Confederation, after discussion which continued until the proclamation of King Wilhelm I of Prussia as Emperor at the Palace of Versailles during the Siege of Paris.\n\nWilhelm accepted this title grudgingly on January 18 1871, having preferred “Emperor of Germany” which in German translates to Kaiser von Deutschland.\n\nHowever, that would have signaled a territorial sovereignty unacceptable to the South German monarchs, as well as a claim to lands outside his realm such as Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and others.\n\n“Emperor of the Germans” was also ruled out by Wilhelm as he considered himself a king who ruled by divine right and chosen “By the Grace of God”, not by the people in a popular monarchy. This was the exact same belief his brother King Friedrich Wilhelm IV professed.\n\nBut more in general, Wilhelm was unhappy about a crown that looked artificial (like Napoléon’s), having been created by a constitution. He was afraid that it would overshadow the Prussian crown. Which it eventually did during the reign of his grandson German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nWhat is interesting is that when I speak of the German Emperors I will refer to them as Kaiser for the most part but will also refer to them as German Emperor. However in writing I always stick to the term German Emperor. Yes I’m not always consistent!\n\nHowever, there is one title I do render in German and that is…\n\nFürst and Fürstin (Plural: Fürsten)\n\nIt is a German word for a ruler and it is also a princely title. Fürstens were, since the Middle Ages, members of the highest nobility who ruled over states of the Holy Roman Empire and later its former territories, and ranks below the ruling Emperor or King.\n\nA Prince of the Holy Roman Empire was the reigning sovereign ruler of an Imperial State that held imperial immediacy in the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. The territory ruled is referred to in German as a Fürstentum (principality), the family dynasty referred to as a Fürstenhaus (princely house), and the (non-reigning) descendants of a Fürst are titled and referred to in German as Prinz (prince) or Prinzessin (princess).\n\nThe English language uses the term “Prince” for both a member of a Royal or Princely family and a reigning Prince. Therefore since the English language doesn’t distinguish between a non reigning Prince and a reigning Prince (Fürst) I will use the title Fürst when necessary and applicable.\n\nNext week I will conclude this series with discussion of titles in Russian.\n\nThe Imperial title\n\nAnother aspect of examining the origins of the Holy Roman Empire is to examine the history of the Imperial title itself. In other words, the history of the title gives us some understanding of the history of the empire itself.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor’s standard designation was simply, originally and officially “August Emperor of the Romans.” In Latin this was translated as “Romanorum Imperator Augustus.” In native German the title was translated as Kaiser der Römer.\n\nLet me expand on this a little further. In German-language historiography, the term Römisch-Deutscher Kaiser (“Roman-German Emperor”) is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman Emperor on one hand, and that of German Emperor (Deutscher Kaiser) on the other, the title held by the Hohenzollern Emperors from 1871 until 1918.\n\nThe English term “Holy Roman Emperor” is modern shorthand for “Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire” and not corresponding to the actual historical style or title. In other words, the adjective “holy” is not intended as modifying “emperor.” The English term “Holy Roman Emperor” gained currency in the interbellum period (the 1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered “German-Roman Emperor” in English.\n\nThe Empire was considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only legal successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Since Charlemagne, the realm was merely referred to as the Roman Empire. The term sacrum (“holy”, in the sense of “consecrated”) in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used beginning in 1157 under Friedrich I Barbarossa. “Holy Empire”: was the term added to reflect Friedrich’s ambition to dominate Italy and the Papacy. The form “Holy Roman Empire” is attested from 1254 onward.\n\nIn a decree following the Diet of Cologne in 1512, the name was changed to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (German: Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation, Latin: Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanicæ), a form first used in a document in 1474. The new title was adopted partly because the Empire lost most of its territories in Italy and Burgundy to the south and west by the late 15th century, but also to emphasize the new importance of the German Imperial Estates in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the term “Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation” fell out of official use. Contradicting the traditional view concerning that designation, Hermann Weisert has argued in a study on imperial titulature that, despite the claims of many textbooks, the name “Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation” never had an official status and points out that documents were thirty times as likely to omit the national suffix as include it.\n\nIn a famous assessment of the name, the political philosopher Voltaire remarked sardonically: “This body which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.\n\nThe title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. It was the pope who had the power to create an emperor. But as the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Heinrich IV and Pope Gregory VII.\n\nThe office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective, although frequently controlled by dynasties. As we have seen since 911, the various German princes had elected the King of the Germans, technically, King of East Francia, from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne.\n\nBeginning with the reign Heinrich II (1002–1024, emperor from 1014) the title King of the Romans (Latin: Rex Romanorum; German: König der Römer) was the title used by the German king following his election the mostly German prince-electors, the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire. Technically they would retain the title “King of the Romans”, until they were officially crowned emperor by the Pope. However, the Papacy’s hold over the emperor wained greatly after the Protestant Reformation as many states became officially Protestant despite the Habsburg emperors remaining Roman Catholic.\n\nCharles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of “Emperor-Elect” in 1558. Despite holding the title Emperor-Elect and forgoing the papal coronation the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire were still simply referred to as emperor. As we began this blog entry, we have seen that the final Holy Roman emperor-elect, Franz II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire’s final dissolution.\n\nHaving read its complex history I see the Carolingian Empire that began with Charlamagne as a “Frankish Empire” and was the first phase in the evolution of the Holy Roman Empire. This Frankish Carolingian Empire eventually died out in 924. Then, with the Revival of the Imperial title under Otto the Great, I view this act as a transition from Frankish Empire to the creation of a “German Empire” which is what came to define the Holy Roman Empire in its essense. As a Germanic Empire it helped foster and grow a diverse German culture signifying an important part of German history."
