        "text": "IMO it was one. As long as the leaders considered themselves Roman it was. If you look at the late Western Roman Empire during Xeno we have a similar system of rivaling Germanic warbands similar to the HRE.\n\nIt was an adoption by a Germanic power [Lombards did the same in Italy becoming \"the fathers of Italy\"].\n\nGenerally Germanic tribes weren't able to administrate great territories and wide populations. They needed some help.\n\nThey met something already ready: the Roman civitas.\n\nSome Germanic tribes even accepted it from the beginning [Ostrogoth tribes, just to say], other Germanic tribes, like the Lombards, needed to try and to fail before of understanding that it was better to adopt Latin customs.\n\nno no, the classical roman empire was indeed a state, very much a state. so much that the early US rushed to cloak itself under the same aesthetics and rethorics.\n\nprobably u might mean the western roman empire after the enter of late antiquity.\n\nit's after theodosius partition in 395 that the lines heavily blurred in the western branch. then, yes, the western section was pretty much a failed state, i'd call it a banana republic, or in this case, a banana empire?\n\nsame description is suitable for the holy roman empire. a banana empire.\n\nregards,\n\nIt wasn't exactly a state, very much in the modern understanding of what a state is, and what it does.\n\nThe early US copied its aesthetics and rethoric, but that doesn't mean they had a full understanding, or grasp, of how the Roman Empire was actually organized, and how Roman central power was emanated to the provinces.\n\nThe Roman Empire was more of a loose and interconnected self-administered number of city-states that followed a set of rules, norms, and the culture that were emanated from Rome, the big metropolis. Most of the administrative power of the Emperor and the Senate of Rome had on its provinces were pretty much only concerning military and religious affairs. Everything else came pretty much from local powers.\n\nI suspect Selim becoming the first Ottoman Caliph contributed heavily to their later dissociation from openly claiming the title Roman Emperor for themselves.\n\nCaliph in its purest form is a rather humble title meaning successor (of the Prophet). Ottoman Sultans like other Muslim rulers before them would style themselves \"The Shadow of God on Earth\" which is found originally in a hadith of the Prophet. Major scholars such as Al-Ghazali, As-Suyuti and Ibn Taymiyyah etc. had analysed and provided explanations of this narration. The hadith does not refer to rulers as shadows of God in the context of power but rather a place to which shade i.e. justice according to Islamic law could be sought. In the eyes of a Muslim ruler claiming such a role held heavy prestige.\n\nThe hadith was narrated by Ibn Umar the son of Caliph Umar\n\nIbn 'Umar reported the Prophet as saying, \"The sultan is God's shade on the earth to which each one of His servants who is wronged repairs. When he is just he will have a reward, and it is the duty of the common people to be grateful; but when he acts tyrannically the burden rests on him, and it is the duty of the common people to show endurance.\"\n\nIt wasn't exactly a state, very much in the modern understanding of what a state is, and what it does.\n\nThe Roman Empire was more of a loose and interconnected self-administered number of city-states that followed a set of rules, norms, and the culture that were emanated from Rome, the big metropolis. Most of the administrative power of the Emperor and the Senate of Rome had on its provinces were pretty much only concerning military and religious affairs. Everything else came pretty much from local powers.\n\nThis is getting very off topic, but the Roman Empire was as much of a state as anything pre ~1600. Perhaps more so. If you want to define \"state\" so narrowly that it can't be applied to any polity before then, you are of course free to do so; but that's not how most people use the term, especially in the given context.\n\nImperial Rome was certainly more of a state than, for example, Greek city-states or medieval feudal kingdoms. One way in which that's visible is that it had institutions that governed which existed beyond those that held sovereignty, ie, the Senate and the Imperial Bureaucracy were more than the citizen body or the Emperor. As for being decentralised, sure, the Roman empire was decentralised compared to modern states, but who said you had to be centralised to be a state? Besides, the Roman empire, especially after Diocletian, was vastly more centralised than anything comparable that came before (in the West at least). While the Imperial government gave provinces and cities some local autonomy, it was Rome's to give and take as it wished underlying just how centralised sovereignty and political legitimacy was, even if the day-to-day task of administration wasn't. And Rome kept a great deal: military matters, taxation, senior officials, grants for building projects, the (nominal) price of goods, etc... If you want to talk about abusing the term \"state\" then calling the cities under Roman control after Augustus \"city-states\" is a prime contender!\n\nRome loomed big in medieval mentality. After the fall of Constantinople Moscovia declared itself the Third Rome.\n\nanthropologically there's an explanation. we always look back to seek for better times.\n\nin mesoamerica, the same happened after the fall of tollan, and then everybody declared themselves the heirs of the toltecs. in south america still today everybody is looking after the heritage of the inca.\n\ni guess xi thinks himself as the new mao, or as the new qin shi huangdi. and of course, american politicians cannot stop portraying themselves in the lights of lincoln, lbj, reagan, bla bla bla.\n\npretty much the same happened in the late middle ages when some smart pals looked back and realized that the dark ages were pretty much, dark. very backward indeed in their eyes in comparison to rome - but i will not give my poisonous opinion.\n\nregards,\n\nCan't see it myself. Sure the \"Roman\" connenction still havd a hold of teh imagination, and soem parts of it were in past part of the Roman Empire.\n\nI mean you could call the Catholic Church a successor State to the Roman Empire with equal validity (Well IMHO) It;s not really true, but if you squint you see how the claim can be made,\n\nWeather of not Roman influence survived elsewhere (It idid), and what the locals believed (people believe all sorts of stuff it donlt make it true) are to my way of thinking irrelevant,\n\nThe Roman Empire was massiev and it;s long shadow was cast over a lot of suceeeding socities in one form or another. But I don;t see HRE as neing culturally or structurally directly built on the Roman Empire."
