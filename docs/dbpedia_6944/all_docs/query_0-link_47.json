        "text": "There is a common saying that goes “History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.” This quote is often attributed to Mark Twain, though there is no evidence that he ever actually said it.\n\nNevertheless, it is an accurate summation- through a combination of geographic, cultural, and social stimuli, patterns can emerge in the historical record that often seem too similar to be mere coincidence. But there are no millennia-old conspiracies or secret ancient societies working behind the scenes- historical trends just tend to be cyclical.\n\nSuch is the case for the relationship between the country of Poland and the geographical territory north of it, commonly known as Prussia. While Prussia has been the home for various cultures and nation-states, they are all connected in their often tumultuous relationship with their southern neighbor. Let us travel through the history of this regional relationship, along with the individuals, decisions, and consequences that drive its rhymes.\n\nThe Cycle Begins- Christianity vs Paganism\n\nIn the 10th century, the territory that now makes up northern Poland and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad was the home of the Old Prussians, a Baltic culture with close genetic and cultural ties with Lithuanians and Latvians. Residing in isolated tribal communities within the primeval forests and marshes in the region, they would frequently launch raiding parties against their neighbors and each other.\n\nIt was these raids that would first drive the Old Prussians into conflict with their southern neighbors, the newly-christened Kingdom of Poland. From its very inception, the Poles sought to secure the territory of Prussia to gain access to the Baltic, and Christianizing the pagan Old Prussians also became a strong motivator for the Roman Catholic kingdom.\n\nAs the Poles were to find out, however, conquering and converting the Old Prussians would prove to be a Herculean task. The Old Prussians were skilled ambushers who knew how to use the terrain to ambush Polish armies and send them fleeing back south. Even when a Polish duke or king raised enough levies to overwhelm the Old Prussians, control over the territory would usually be lost in a generation or two.\n\nThe Old Prussian faith would also prove to be one of the most resilient pagan faiths that the medieval church would ever face. Every time a Polish monarch would arrive and demand that the Prussians burn their idols and convert, the Old Prussians would smile and comply… only to dig up their hidden idols and return to their own practices the moment the Poles were gone.\n\nMissionaries sent by the church were met with utter hostility- when Bishop Adalbert of Prague arrived in 997 AD to convert the Old Prussians, he and his companions were beaten to death and decapitated by a mob. Though he would later be canonized as a martyr saint for his efforts.\n\nThis long back-and-forth between the Poles and Prussians finally culminated in the ambush at the Osse River in 1116 AD. Here, a Polish army under Duke Henry of Sandomierz was lured into a marsh where his horses became trapped in the mud, leaving them as sitting ducks as an Old Prussian army gathered around them in the forest and cut off their escape.\n\nThe ensuing battle saw the Polish army nearly entirely annihilated, with Henry also dying in battle. It was this devastating loss that convinced the Poles that the Old Prussians could not be subjugated, at least not without outside assistance.\n\nThe Rise of the Teutonic Order\n\nIn the 13th century, the once-powerful Kingdom of Poland had fragmented into a patchwork of squabbling dukes vying for power, the result of a messy dynastic succession. One of these dukes was Konrad I of Mazovia, whose territory was the frequent victim of Old Prussian raids from the north.\n\nSince he was surrounded by ambitious brothers and cousins waiting for any sign of weakness, Konrad I could spare little to counter the Old Prussians. Tired of their constant raiding, he made a fateful decision- he would outsource the problem to the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, better known as the Teutonic Knights.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights were a monastic order founded by German Crusaders in the Holy Land, where they protected pilgrims traveling to the many holy sites in the region. As the Crusades in the Levant tapered off, however, they realized that they would need to find a new theater of operations to maintain their existence.\n\nAnd Konrad’s offer of combatting the Old Prussians was exactly what they were looking for. Under the terms of the agreement, the Teutonic Knights would be allowed to independently operate in the territory of Prussia with the expectation that any Christianized territory would be return to the Polish crown.\n\nWith this newfound purpose, the Teutonic Knights zealously set out to achieve their goal of converting the Old Prussians. Any Old Prussians that did not convert were slaughtered with impunity, with their lands seized and their villages put to the torch. Many Old Prussian tribes attempted to resist the Knights, but their inability to work together resulted in their piecemeal annihilation.\n\nIn just 50 years after their arrival in 1226 AD, the Teutonic Knights had annihilated the Old Prussians as an independent culture. Their language and pagan faith was wiped out, and any converted survivors would eventually become Germanized. This did not end the Knight’s activity in the region- they would expand their operations into pagan Lithuania and Samogitia.\n\nAs for Poland, they were initially satisfied that the Old Prussian raids had finally come to an end. But they would soon discover that through Konrad’s invitation they had traded one problem for another…\n\nFrom Allies to Enemies\n\nIn 1308 AD, the Poles first realized they had made a Faustian bargain inviting the Knights into Pomerania when the Order took over the city of Danzig (or Gdańsk in Polish).\n\nThe Teutonic Order had responded to a call for help from Poland in order to free the city from occupation by the Margrave of Brandenburg- but they then refused to return the city afterwards. Although the city was Christian and legally part of the Kingdom of Poland, the Knights slaughtered the inhabitants and made it their own.\n\nThe Poles were infuriated at the loss of the city, as it now meant they were cut off from accessing the Baltic Sea. War would arise between the Knights and the Kingdom of Poland from 1326 to 1332, but it would end in the Knight’s favor as they seized more territory from the Poles.\n\nKonrad’s offer had thus only resulted in replacing the Old Prussians with the Teutonic Knights- it was as if the status quo of two centuries prior had been restored. The Kingdom of Poland, however, would maintain peace with the Teutonic Knights for another 70 years- by themselves they had little chance of fully subjugating the well-trained Knights of the Order. But as it turned out, they would soon no longer have to fight alone.\n\nThe Humbling of the Teutonic Order\n\nIn 1386, “King” Jadwiga of Poland married Grand Duke of Lithuania Władysław II Jagiełło, uniting the two realms under a personal union and initializing the Christianization of Lithuania. Although it would take time for the two nations to grow more political connected, the Poles and Lithuanians could now face their mutual foes together.\n\nFor the Teutonic Order, the union was a geopolitical disaster. Their two greatest rivals in the Baltic had joined forces and were already eyeing the lands the Knights had taken from them. Worse, their purpose in the region was now gone- with the conversion of Lithuania, there were no more pagan nations left to Crusade against.\n\nNonetheless, the Teutonic Order still had a strong military. And it was not like they were averse to attacking regions of the same faith. Thus, when the Samogitians rose up against the Teutonic Order and both Poland and Lithuania responded to their pleas for assistance, the Knights of the Order under Grandmaster Ulrich von Jungingen rode out to meet them.\n\nThe result of this was the Battle of Grunwald on July 15th, 1410, where 27,000 Teutonic Knights and their retainers faced an army of 39,000 Poles and Lithuanians in the largest battle in medieval history. The battle ended in a decisive defeat for the Teutonic Order, with their army largely wiped out and Grandmaster von Jungingen slain in battle. Although the Order would only face minimal territorial losses in the 1411 Peace of Thorn, they would never recover.\n\nAs there were no more pagans to convert in Prussia, fewer and fewer recruits arrived to join the monastic order, and church funding also dried up. The Knights were forced to tax Danzig and other Prussian cities to make up for the deficit in funding, which soured their relations with the residents of Prussia and led to a revolt that caused Poland and Lithuania to once again attack the Order. After 10 years of fighting, the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 saw the Teutonic Order lose Danzig and half their Prussian territory to Poland-Lithuania, where it would become known as “Royal Prussia.”\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Order effectively became a Polish vassal that had to swear fealty to the king upon taking office. With its territory reduced in size and its relevancy rapidly fading, the destruction of the Teutonic Knights appeared inevitable.\n\nFrom Monastic Order to Feudal Duchy\n\nBy the early 16th century, the Teutonic Knights were in terrible shape. Their castles were decaying into ruins, their treasury was empty, and few Europeans were willing to take up the cross anymore. Worse, the Protestant Reformation had reached Prussia as some Knights began considering to convert to Lutheranism, which threatened to tear the Order apart.\n\nIn 1519, war once again broke out between the Knights and Poland-Lithuania. The Teutonic Knights surprisingly managed to hold their own against the union of two nations despite their disadvantages, but both sides began to suffer economic woes as the conflict dragged on.\n\nIt was in 1521 that Grandmaster Albert of the House of Hohenzollern came up with a scheme to preserve his own power and control over Prussia- he would renounce his monastic vows by converting to Lutheranism, secularize the Order into a ducal fief, and swear fealty to Poland-Lithuania. The King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund I “The Old,” accepted Albert’s offer, and in February 1521 Albert knelt before the King and accepted the title of Duke of Prussia.\n\nWith this arrangement, the former territory of the Teutonic Knights would become known as Ducal Prussia and serve as a vassal to the Polish-Lithuanian monarch. It would retain some autonomy, but was expected to provide military support when the King called for it.\n\nFor the next few decades the Dukes of Prussia would serve Poland-Lithuania loyally, and they sent representatives to the Union of Lublin in 1569 when the personal union of the two nations was transformed into a Commonwealth. Perhaps now, at last, Poland could finally rest easy and consider the Prussian problem to be over?\n\nThe First Major Mistake\n\nIn 1618, the last Hohenzollern Duke of Prussia died without any heirs, leaving the succession of the Duchy in doubt. Another branch of Hohenzollerns ruled the Electorate of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire, however, and they petitioned King Sigismund III Vasa of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for inheritance of the duchy. The King agreed to their proposal.\n\nWhile it was not yet obvious at the time, this decision was a dangerous blunder. Instead of a vassal who would be dependent on the Polish crown for protection, the Dukes of Prussia could now use the resources of Brandenburg to increase their own power and cajole Poland-Lithuania for further concessions. In addition, freeing Prussia from Polish control would now be the dream of every following Elector of Brandenburg.\n\nThe Second Major Mistake\n\nIn 1657, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fought for its very existence as Cossacks, Russians, and the Swedes invaded at once and threatened to destroy the union of two nations altogether. This crisis would be known in Polish history as “The Deluge.” In addition to the foreign invaders, the Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, Frederick William “The Great Elector” had reneged on his duties as vassal and joined in the mass invasion of Poland.\n\nFor the beleaguered King John II Casimir of Poland-Lithuania, the Prussians needed to be pacified if the Commonwealth was to survive and free itself. So he proposed an offer to Frederick- complete independence from Polish vassalage in exchange for military support. Frederick, of course, agreed.\n\nWhile the Prussians would go on to assist Poland-Lithuania in successfully repelling the Swedes, in the long term John II Casimir’s decision would be ranked as one of the greatest mistakes Poland would make in its more than a thousand years of existence. Prussia was now once again an independent entity, and the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia would now always covet Royal Prussia in order to unite their two disparate territories.\n\nAs the 17th century went on, Brandenburg-Prussia grew in military and economic strength while Poland-Lithuania declined through its own political weaknesses. King John III Sobieski did plan to invade Ducal Prussia and reincorporate it into the Commonwealth in the 1680s, but the Ottoman Siege of Vienna distracted him and the opportunity was lost.\n\nIn 1701, Elector Frederick III received permission from the Holy Roman Emperor to upgrade his state from the rank of Electorate to that of Kingdom. In addition, he would drop the “Brandenburg” from Brandenburg-Prussia, leaving his kingdom with a new name- Prussia.\n\nThe Prussians Triumphant\n\nThe 18th century would see the Kingdom of Prussia rise to become a Great Power in Europe while Poland-Lithuania decayed into a near-anarchic backwater. Although their nation was short on natural resources, the Prussians developed a strong military tradition that allowed them to combat states far larger than their own.\n\nIn 1748, the Prussian army under Frederick II “The Great” would defeat Austria in battle and annex the territory of Silesia, giving them control over the resource-rich region. The Kingdom of Prussia now resembled a gaping maw ready to devour the western regions of the ailing Commonwealth.\n\nAnd devour it did. Frederick had always intended to seize Royal Prussia from the Commonwealth and finally connect his two land territories, and in 1772 he finally succeeded in convincing Russia and Austria to enact the First Partition of Poland.\n\nUnder the Partition, Poland-Lithuania would lose 30% of its territory while Prussia finally got the land connection it always desired. Danzig was still a Polish enclave for the time being, but brutal Prussian customs duties ensured that it could no longer enrich the Commonwealth with Baltic trade.\n\nFurther Partitions would occur in 1793 and 1795 as the Prussians seized Danzig and much of Poland’s western provinces, while the Commonwealth ceased to exist altogether. It appeared that after centuries of back-and-forth warfare and vast changes in culture and faith, the Prussian north had at last triumphed over the Polish south.\n\nRebirth of Poland\n\nBut Prussia would not get to enjoy victory in perpetuity- it was now Poland’s turn to wait for an opportunity to rise up and revitalize itself. Various Polish uprisings in the 19th century would end in failure, but Prussia and later the united German Empire never succeeded in successfully Germanizing their Polish provinces.\n\nFinally, in November 11th, 1918, the defeat of Germany in World War I saw the rebirth of an independent Polish state and the end of the German Empire (and by extension, the Kingdom of Prussia). Through the Treaty of Versailles, Poland would also regain control of Danzig and the Baltic Sea, severing East Prussia away from the rest of Germany. If one were to line up a map of 1918 with one before the First Partition, the borders of this new “Polish Corridor” are remarkably similar to those of Royal Prussia and Ducal Prussia.\n\nThus, in a stunning turnaround, it appeared that Poland had resurrected itself from the dead and finally triumphed against their Prussian rival. And unlike the Prussians it did not have to reinvent its cultural identity to survive. But though Prussia as an independent legal entity lost all relevancy, the cycle of conflict over Prussia as a geographical region was not quite over.\n\nWorld War II and Beyond\n\nIn August of 1939, the German Reich under the leadership of Adolf Hitler sent an ultimatum to Poland demanding the transfer of Danzig and the Polish corridor to Germany. When Poland refused, Germany invaded the country on September 1st, sparking the Second World War in Europe. Once again, Prussia was the focal point of a major European conflict.\n\nEventually, the tide of war would turn against the German Reich, and the Soviet Red Army would occupy East Prussia and drive the Germans out of formerly Polish territory in January of 1945. East Prussia was then split between Poland and the Soviet Union, and for the first time since its earliest years Poland now held the majority of the territory of Prussia.\n\nSo is the Prussian question finally settled? The Soviets forcefully transferred the German population out of the region, and the modern nation of Germany abandoned all claims to the region in 1990. Thus, German interest in the region is officially null.\n\nNonetheless, ongoing questions over the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad indicate that future historical events might still flare up in this Baltic region. While Prussia as an independent entity is dead and likely never coming back, who knows how the cycles of history will turn next?\n\nThe Polish could not possibly predict that the vassalized Duchy of Prussia would devour them 200 years later. And the pagan Old Prussians could not possibly predict that a Lutheran German kingdom would also go on to call themselves “Prussians.” Nothing is ever truly set in stone, and even the most innocent of decisions can have far-reverberating consequences long after the lives of those who made them."
