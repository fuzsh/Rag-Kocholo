        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nRussia has the longest border of any country on Earth. In the west it borders Norway, Finland, the Gulf of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, and Ukraine. (A small exclave of Russia, Kaliningrad—formerly part of Germany—borders the Baltic Sea on the north and west, Poland on the south, and Lithuania on the north and east.) In the south Russia touches the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, Georgia, Azerbaijan, the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and North Korea. In the east and north it borders various branches of the Pacific and Arctic oceans, respectively.\n\nTopographic Regions\n\nRussia contains two stable continental blocks—the East European and Siberian platforms. The suture that ties the two platforms together is the 250-million-year-old Ural Mountain chain, which forms the traditional boundary between Europe and Asia. Around these platforms are folded mountain systems of younger ages. The platforms’ ancient rocks (more than 550 million years old) are exposed on the Fennoscandian Shield of the northwest, in the southern Urals, and on Siberia’s Aldan and Anabar shields. The youngest materials are the sediments of the Azov-Caspian and West Siberian plains.\n\nEuropean Russia (the area west of the Urals) is dominated by the Russian Plain (also called the East European Plain). This vast lowland region extends 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the western border eastward to the Urals and from the Arctic Ocean more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) southward to the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian Sea. Rising above the plain are the low Valdai Hills, which have a maximum elevation of 1,125 feet (343 meters); the Smolensk Upland and the Central Russian Upland, both approximately 1,000 feet (300 meters); and the Volga Hills. The Valdai Hills and the Smolensk Upland are made up of deposits left by glaciers. The highest elevations west of the Urals are in the Greater Caucasus mountains, at Russia’s southern tip. In this range is Mount Elbrus, an extinct volcano that rises 18,510 feet (5,642 meters) and is the highest peak in Europe. On the Kola Peninsula of the northwest, the Khibiny Mountains reach heights of nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) above sea level.\n\nThe Ural Mountains are low-lying remnants of much higher ranges. For some 250 million years these once-mighty mountains have been worn down by erosion. The northern Urals are highest, with peaks above 6,000 feet (1,800 meters). The central Urals are lowest and are the location of the main transportation routes, including the Trans-Siberian Railroad. The southern Urals are of medium elevation but broad.\n\nRussia’s most extensive geographic region is the West Siberian Plain. It stretches 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) from the Urals eastward to the Yenisey River and 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) north to south. The plain rises above 650 feet (200 meters) in elevation only in the far south. The Ob River and its tributaries flow slowly across this massive lowland into the Arctic Ocean. When the southern tributaries swell with meltwater in the spring, the main trunk, the Ob, is still ice-dammed in the north. The flooding is extensive, creating the largest swamp in the Northern Hemisphere, the Vasyugan Swamp.\n\nEast of the Yenisey River lies the Central Siberian Plateau. This upland region, with elevations mostly between 1,000 and 2,300 feet (300 to 700 meters), covers most of the land between the Yenisey and the Lena River. To the north it descends to the North Siberian Lowland. To the south are the Sayan and Baikal mountains.\n\nRussia’s final geographic region is a series of high mountain ranges that dominates the south and east. The Altai Mountains, which reach a maximum elevation of 14,783 feet (4,506 meters), lie on Russia’s borders with Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The Altai merge in the east with the Sayan Mountains, which extend to Lake Baikal and its surrounding ranges. Swinging arclike first eastward and then northward along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk are the Stanovoy, Dzhugdzhur, and Kolyma ranges. The Anadyr, Koryak, and Kamchatka ranges compose the Chukchi and Kamchatka peninsulas. The latter is one of Earth’s most volcanically active regions. This is also true of the Kuril (derived from the Russian verb “to smoke”) Islands. In the southeast the Amur River is flanked in the north by the Bureya Range and in the south by the Sikhote-Alin. Deep in the interior along the eastern bank of the Lena is the Verkhoyansk Range, which links with the Chersky Range.\n\nIn eastern Siberia lowlands are dispersed. The North Siberian Lowland divides the same-named plateau from the hilly Taymyr Peninsula. The Lena River creates the Central Yakut Lowland in its middle course near Yakutsk. Likewise the Kolyma Lowland is the product of the Kolyma River’s winding course. Along the Amur is the fertile Zeya-Bureya Plain. Along the Ussuri River, a tributary of the Amur, is the Ussuri Lowland.\n\nRivers and Lakes\n\nAmong its 100,000 rivers, Russia contains some of the world’s longest. Four of the country’s five longest rivers—the Ob-Irtysh, Amur, Lena, and Yenisey—are in Siberia. All but the Amur flow northward into the Arctic Ocean. The longest European river is the Volga, which flows southward into the Caspian Sea. The Volga is famous for its major role in Russian history.\n\nThe most impressive of Russia’s many lakes is Lake Baikal (or Baykal), in southeastern Siberia. It is the world’s deepest lake, with a maximum depth of more than 1 mile (1,600 meters). Lake Baikal contains about one-fifth of the world’s fresh water—more water than all five of the Great Lakes of North America combined. Truly unique on Earth, Baikal is home to more than 2,000 species of plants and animals, the majority of which can be found nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe greatest concentration of lakes is in the Karelia region of the northwest. Here ancient glaciers left thousands of bodies of water as they receded. The largest of these are Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega.\n\nClimate\n\nAs with its topography, Russia’s climates span vast distances. The climates of both European and Asian Russia are continental except for the northern tundra and the extreme southeast. Great seasonal ranges of temperature are typical. In winter temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot and humid, even in Siberia.\n\nRussia has low annual precipitation that almost everywhere averages less than 24 inches (60 centimeters) and peaks in summer—usually in July or August. Rain and snow totals are typically higher in the mountains.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nRussia’s population peaked in the early 1990s at about 149 million people and then began a steep decline. The reasons for the decline included a low birth rate and a significant drop in life expectancy due to such factors as drug and alcohol use, high smoking rates, poor nutrition, and inadequate health care. Recognizing the decline as a national crisis, the Russian government took steps to reverse the trend in the early 21st century. For example, it authorized incentive payments to women who had more than one child and introduced programs that promoted healthy lifestyles.\n\nAbout four-fifths of the Russian population is concentrated in the European portion of the country, especially in the fertile region surrounding Moscow. Beginning in the 1890s and continuing throughout the next century, many people migrated from European Russia to Siberia. Still, however, Siberia contains only about one-fifth of the population though it makes up three-quarters of the country’s territory. Most of Siberia’s people live in the west or in pockets in the far south. Vast stretches of thinly settled and empty territories lie north of the main settled belt.\n\nEthnic Groups and Languages\n\nRussia has great diversity among its people, with more than 120 distinct ethnic groups. Ethnic Russians make up about four-fifths of the population. The largest minority groups include the Tatars, Ukrainians, Bashkir, Chuvash, Chechen, Armenian, Mordvin, and Belarusian. Linguistically, the population of Russia can be divided into several groups. The Indo-European group comprises East Slavic and Indo-Iranian speakers. The Altaic group includes Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus. The Uralic group includes Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic. The Caucasian group comprises Abkhazo-Adyghian and Nakho-Dagestani speakers. In addition, there are several Paleo-Asiatic language groups in far eastern Siberia.\n\nRussian is the official language. It is one of three languages in the eastern branch of the Slavic language family (the others are Ukrainian and Belarusian). It has origins in Old Church Slavonic, a language used by the Greek missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ad 800s to spread Christianity among the Slavs. Cyril and Methodius created a Slavic alphabet based on Greek characters. A modified form of this alphabet, named Cyrillic after Cyril, is still used to write modern Russian. Tsar Peter the Great made his mark on the language by altering the Cyrillic alphabet in the early 1700s. Peter’s alphabet was further simplified in 1918 to form the current system of 33 letters. Peter’s efforts to bring Western influences into Russian culture also began the incorporation of many words from western European languages into Russian. Since World War II it has borrowed many American terms.\n\nReligions\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity is the foremost religion in Russia. About half of all Russians who practice religion belong to the Russian Orthodox church. However, because religious activities were restricted by the government during the Soviet years, Russian Orthodox Christians number only about one-sixth of the population. The overwhelming majority of the population is nonreligious. Muslims make up Russia’s second largest religious group.\n\nAlthough there is some degree of correlation between language and religion, the two do not correspond entirely. Slavs are overwhelmingly Orthodox Christian. Turkic speakers are mainly Muslim, though several Turkic groups in Russia are not. For example, Christianity predominates among the Chuvash. Buddhism prevails among large numbers of Altai, Khakass, and Tyvans. Many Turkic speakers east of the Yenisey have retained their traditional shamanistic beliefs (though some have converted to Christianity). Buddhism is common also among the Mongolian-speaking Buryat and Kalmyk.\n\nJews make up a tiny percentage of the population. They long suffered discrimination in Russia, including purges in the 19th century, repression under the regime of Joseph Stalin, and Nazi atrocities on Russian soil during World War II. Beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist policies in the 1980s, Jewish emigration to Israel and elsewhere was permitted on an increasing scale. As a result, the number of Jews living in Russia (and all parts of the former Soviet Union) decreased.\n\nThe Arts\n\nRussia’s culture represents a melding of native Slavic traditions and influences from a variety of foreign cultures. Beginning in the 800s, following contact with Christian missionaries from the Byzantine Empire, the borrowings were primarily from Eastern Orthodox Byzantine culture. From the 1300s to the 1600s Asian influences brought by the Mongol occupiers were added to the cultural mix. Finally, since the 1700s, the cultural heritage of western Europe has contributed to modern Russian culture.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe Russian literary tradition began with a body of proverbs, folktales, legends, and heroic ballads that passed orally among the earliest East Slavic tribes. The oldest dated Russian manuscript is The Ostromir Gospel (1056–57). From that time until the reign of Peter the Great in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, written literature was mainly religious in nature.\n\nThe 1800s are recognized as the Golden Age of Russian literature, a time when it began to show a conscience, especially regarding serfdom and the downtrodden. Aleksander Pushkin, often described as the “Russian Shakespeare,” blended European and native Russian influences to reflect the thoughts, moods, and deeds of the society in which he lived. Mikhail Lermontov, considered Russia’s greatest Romanticist, was another important poet of the Golden Age. He was the first Russian poet to describe not only the beauty of the Caucasus Mountains but also Caucasian culture and folk art.\n\nOther great writers of the Golden Age include Nikolay Gogol, Ivan Goncharov, Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Maksim Gorky, and Aleksandr Blok. Chekhov, Gorky, and Blok wrote works that overlapped the 19th and 20th centuries. With them came another literary and artistic revival, designated sometimes as the Silver Age.\n\nDuring the Soviet era Russian writers and artists were expected to take a positive view of socialist society. Writers were organized into the Union of Soviet Writers, which was guided by the Stalinist doctrine of socialist realism. Some writers, however, wanted to maintain their artistic independence. Several chose to leave Russia and live abroad. Among the notable writers who left Russia during the Soviet period were Ivan Bunin and Vladimir Nabokov. The period after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 was marked by several “thaws” during which writers were given a bit more freedom. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn became famous during one such thaw, though he was eventually expelled from the Soviet Union. In 1958 Boris Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his epic novel Doctor Zhivago, but he had to decline the award because of Soviet opposition to his work. Anna Akhmatova produced brilliant poems during the Soviet period, though for years she was forced into literary silence. Other outstanding Russian writers of the Soviet period were the novelist Mikhail Sholokhov and the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Andrey Voznesensky. The collapse of the Soviet regime brought an end to government censorship and freed writers to engage in radical experimentalism. (See also Russian literature.)\n\nVisual arts\n\nLike literature, Russian art was the servant of the Orthodox church until the reign of Peter the Great. Until then borrowings from the Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns, and Turko-Mongols were the basis for the rich background of folk art that entered the liturgical tradition by way of embroidery, metalwork, leatherwork, wood carving, and some bas-relief sculpture.\n\nSculpture did not play a role in Russian art until relatively recent times because the church forbade the display of the human body in three-dimensional form. This also explains why the figures in icons are so two-dimensional in appearance. A serious art, icon painting was brought to its zenith as a Russian art form in the 14th and 15th centuries by Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublyov. Until the late 1600s the icon and the mosaic were the Russian artist’s sole outlet.\n\nModern Westernized painting and sculpture date from Peter’s reforms after 1700. Perhaps the most famous Russian artist in the last 200 years was Ilya Repin, who flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The stress on socialist realism in art as well as literature hampered artistic creativity beginning in the 1920s. Experimental art typically was banned and forced underground. With the opening of Soviet society in the 1980s, however, public exhibits of modern art were again permitted.\n\nBeginning in the 10th century Russian architecture was influenced by contacts with the Byzantine Empire. From the outset, however, Russian buildings had a higher, narrower silhouette than their Byzantine models. Russians experimented with the dome, which was derived from the yurt—a circular tent used by Central Asian nomads. This led to the onion-shaped domes characteristic of Russian Orthodox churches.\n\nEarly Russian architecture cannot be divided into periods like Gothic or baroque. Rather it sprang from different city centers: Kyiv (Kiev), Novgorod, Moscow, and later St. Petersburg. Soviet buildings were pragmatic products of standardized architecture, largely the result of the need to build quickly after the decimation of World War II. On a grander scale, several “wedding-cake” (tiered) skyscrapers built under Joseph Stalin still dominate Moscow’s skyline. Since the 1960s more innovative architectural styles have appeared around the country, often combining European and Russian traditions.\n\nMusic\n\nBecause musical instruments were forbidden in Russian Orthodox church services, Russian music and consequently opera were delayed in development as an art form until more recent times. Typically, Russian choruses chanted and sang without accompaniment except for an occasional drumbeat. Secular vocal music did not develop until the 1800s. Since then Russian operas, symphonies, instrumental compositions, and art songs have flourished. Most are based on the melodic and rhythmic patterns of Russian folk music and nationalistic themes. The latter were particularly stressed during the Soviet period.\n\nThe most ancient Russian folk instrument was a kind of zither, the gusli. Other traditional stringed instruments are the domra, gudok, and balalaika. The last, a triangular, three-stringed, short-necked instrument, was made popular in the 1800s in both city salons and in the countryside. Wind instruments include the flutelike dudka and suirel.\n\nRussian music came of age in 1836 with the performance of Mikhail Glinka’s opera A Life for the Czar, later called Ivan Susanin. Glinka also produced a musical fairy tale based on Pushkin’s poem Ruslan and Lyudmila (1842), but Glinka’s operas contain many examples of Italian style.\n\nThe Russian nationalist school was founded by Modest Mussorgsky with the production of the opera Boris Godunov (1869). Mussorgsky was one of a group of Russian composers whom critics at the time called “The Five.” The group included Mily Balakirev, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Aleksandr Borodin, and César Cui. Balakirev is noted for his classical renderings of Russian folk music. Rimsky-Korsakov developed Orientalism to near perfection in his fairy-tale operas and in the brilliant symphonic suite Sheherazade. Borodin also followed this pattern in his opera Prince Igor. Cui composed miniature forms.\n\nNot one of The Five, but the most famous of all Russian composers, is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composer of the well-known 1812 Overture and many other works, including symphonies, symphonic poems, operas, ballets, concertos, and piano pieces. Distinctively Russian, Tchaikovsky’s melancholic lyricism was perpetuated by the music of Sergey Rachmaninoff, the last of the Russian Romantic composers.\n\nFamous Russian composers of the 20th century were Igor Stravinsky, Sergey Prokofiev, Aleksandr Scriabin, and Dimitry Shostakovich. Stravinsky, however, was a resident of France and the United States for most of his creative life. Prokofiev left Russia in 1918 after conducting the first performance of his well-known Classical Symphony. He did not return permanently until 1932. Shostakovich composed 15 symphonies and two operas, some of which received severe criticism for not following the line of socialist realism.\n\nPerforming arts\n\nBallet was introduced to Russia as court entertainment in the early 1700s. By mid-century it had spread to the estates of the wealthy. Simultaneously, imperial ballet theaters and companies were created. In the 1800s the distinctive style of Russian ballet was strongly influenced by French, Italian, and Swedish choreographers and dancers, including Marius Petipa, considered the father of modern ballet. Only late in the century did the first Russian choreographers arise—Lev Ivanov and Michel Fokine.\n\nAs the great dancers Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky rose to fame in the early 20th century, Russian ballet reached a high technical and stylistic level. In 1909 the impresario Serge Diaghilev founded the Ballets Russes and took Russian ballet to the capitals of Europe and the major cities of the United States.\n\nSoviet ballet continued the 19th-century traditions. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Mariinsky (formerly Kirov) Ballet in St. Petersburg remain famous throughout the world. Some of the more notable dancers to emerge during the Soviet era were Maya Plisetskaya, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The latter two dancers made headlines by defecting to the West at the height of their careers.\n\nRussian theater originally was inspired by folk entertainment. Peasant companies performed for serfs and nobility alike, sometimes traveling from estate to estate. Later Russian theater was influenced by foreign models much like the ballet. The first Russian dramatists appeared in about 1750. Under Catherine the Great, herself an author of comedies, theater reached new highs, but most of the works were of foreign origin. Great Russian comedy came in the 1800s with the work of Aleksandr Griboyedov (Woe from Wit, 1822–24) and Nikolay Gogol (The Inspector General, 1836).\n\nAt the end of the 19th century Konstantin Stanislavsky founded the Moscow Art Theater, where Russian theater art came of age. Realistic plays produced there, among them the works of Chekhov and Gorky, stimulated the modern “method” school of acting. Nonrealistic theater, called conditional theater by producer-director-actor Vsevolod Meyerhold, flourished through the early Soviet period. As in literature under Joseph Stalin, experimental theater was replaced by socialist realism. Not until the 1980s, with the end of government censorship, was the performance of controversial works permitted. Writers shifted away from political topics and toward classical and psychological themes.\n\nCultural Institutions\n\nRussia has hundreds of museums, some of which are world famous. In Moscow, the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts houses treasures of western European art, while the Tretyakov Gallery has a strong collection of Russian art. Also in Moscow, the Kremlin—home of the Russian president—contains several museums. South of the city is the museum-estate of Leo Tolstoy called Yasnaya Polyana, which features an excellent literary collection. Prominent museums in St. Petersburg include the Hermitage and the Russian Museum. In addition to the Moscow Art Theater, world-renowned Russian theaters include the Bolshoi, Maly, Vakhtangov, and Novaya (New) Opera theaters and the Obraztsov Puppet Theater in Moscow. Among the famed theaters in other Russian cities are the Mariinsky and Tovstonogov theaters in St. Petersburg and the Novosibirsk Theater of Opera and Ballet in Novosibirsk.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nDuring the Soviet period, education was highly centralized, and indoctrination into Marxist-Leninist theory was a major element of schooling. The end of communist rule led to extensive curriculum revision.\n\nFree, compulsory education begins at age six or seven and lasts for 11 years. This period, increased from nine years by a 2007 law, encompasses primary and secondary education. Minority children are taught in their own languages, but the study of Russian is required at the secondary level.\n\nEntry to higher education is selective and highly competitive. The most prestigious schools include Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and Novosibirsk State University. Higher education is almost entirely in Russian, though a few institutions—mostly in minority areas—use the local language as well.\n\nPublic welfare funds are used to improve the material and social conditions of workers in Russia. Social welfare programs formerly were funded by the central government. However, in the 1990s employer-based social insurance and pension funds, to which workers also contributed, were introduced. A major portion of Russia’s public welfare budget funds free medical care, pensions, and scholarships.\n\nEconomy\n\nBecause of its great size, its natural resources, and its political domination, Russia played a leading role in the economy of the Soviet Union. During that period the Russian economy was heavily industrialized, with strong development in such areas as mining, metals, chemicals, and energy production. By the 1980s, however, the economy of Russia and the country as a whole was in serious decline. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian government implemented radical reforms to convert the centrally controlled economy into a market economy based on private enterprise. The transition proved to be slow and difficult, causing extreme hardships for the Russian people. By the end of the 20th century the economy had begun to recover, fueled mainly by a boom in the oil and gas industry. A decade of rapid growth ended with the global economic crisis that began in late 2008. The crisis hit Russia especially hard, suggesting that further reforms were needed to ensure the country’s continued economic growth and stability. The government has since established programs aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing dependency on oil and gas exports.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nBecause of the harshness of the Russian environment, less than one-sixth of the land is dedicated to agriculture. About three-fifths of the farmland is used for growing crops, with the remainder devoted to pasture. Many collective and state farms established during the Soviet era continue to operate, though many have been privatized and renamed as companies or cooperatives. Overall, agriculture contributes approximately 5 percent to Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs less than one-tenth of the total labor force.\n\nRussian farms produce mainly grains, particularly wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Fodder crops for livestock—grasses, clovers, root crops, and corn (maize)—are also grown. Other major crops include sunflowers, sugar beets, and potatoes and other vegetables. Cattle, sheep, and pigs are the most important livestock.\n\nWith access to three of the world’s oceans—the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific—Russian fishing fleets are a major contributor to the economy. The industry declined significantly in the post-Soviet years, however, as it struggled with the loss of government support and regulation. The chief fishing ports are Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea (which connects with the Atlantic), Murmansk and Archangel on the Barents Sea (Arctic), and Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan (Pacific). Smaller-scale fishing takes place in the Sea of Azov and the Black and Caspian seas. The Caspian sturgeon is the source of the world’s finest caviar. By the early 21st century, however, overfishing, poaching (illegal fishing), and pollution had pushed sturgeon to the brink of extinction. There are important inland fisheries on lakes and rivers, including a good deal of fish farming.\n\nRussia has the world’s largest forest reserves, which supply lumber, pulp and paper, and other products. Needle-leaf trees predominate, making the country a world leader in softwood production.\n\nIndustry\n\nRussian industry depends in large part on the country’s vast energy and mineral resources. The country ranks among the world’s leading producers of oil and natural gas. The great bulk of the oil and natural gas comes from huge fields in western Siberia. Extensive pipeline systems link producing districts to all parts of Russia and across the border to many Central Asian and European countries. Russia also has massive reserves of coal, especially in Siberia. Power plants fueled by natural gas, oil, and coal provide about three-quarters of the country’s electricity. The remaining power output comes from hydroelectric and nuclear plants. Russia is also a world leader in the production of numerous other minerals, including iron ore, cobalt, copper, nickel, platinum, gold, and diamonds.\n\nThese resources provide raw materials for Russia’s most important manufacturing industries—metals and machine-building. Iron ore is the basis of the massive steel industry. Machine-building factories satisfy most of Russia’s requirements for electric generators, steam boilers and turbines, grain combines, electric locomotives, and automobiles. It also fills much of its demand for shipbuilding, machine tools, instruments, and automation components. Russia’s factories also produce military equipment, including tanks, jet fighters, and rockets, for export. Another important heavy manufacturing industry is the production of chemicals. Chemical industries requiring large quantities of electric power are particularly important in Siberia, where both timber and electricity are plentiful.\n\nLight industry contributes only a small part of Russia’s industrial output. Production of textiles, clothing, leather, and footwear plummeted in the 1990s, as inefficient Russian factories suffered from competition with foreign companies. The most valuable light industry in the early 21st century was the manufacture of food products and beverages. A growing industry during that period was the production of electrical and electronic equipment, such as personal computers and cellular telephones.\n\nServices\n\nDespite the ongoing importance of agriculture and industry, services accounted for about three-fifths of Russia’s economic output and employment in the early 21st century. The wide-ranging service sector includes trade, government, education, health care, tourism, and financial services such as banking and insurance.\n\nForeign trade is very important to the Russian economy. The country has generally enjoyed a healthy trade surplus since the end of the Soviet Union. Primary exports include oil, natural gas, metals, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, and forestry products. Leading imports include machinery and transport equipment, foods, pharmaceutical products, and chemicals. Among Russia’s leading trade partners are the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, Turkey, the United States, and Belarus.\n\nTravel and tourism account for several million jobs in Russia. More than 20 million foreign visitors traveled to Russia in 2018. Among the country’s most popular tourist destinations are Moscow, St. Petersburg, and the Krasnodar territory. Free from the restrictions of Soviet times, Russians have increasingly traveled abroad.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nRussia’s great expanse requires an extensive transportation system. For carrying freight and passengers over long distances, railroads were dominant in the Soviet era and remain so today. The rail system is much denser in European Russia than it is in Siberia. East of the Urals it consists of only a few major routes—for example, the Trans-Siberian Railroad and Baikal-Amur Mainline—with feeder branches to areas of economic significance.\n\nOther than highways that link major cities in the European section, the road system is underdeveloped. Because motor vehicles were not much used for long-distance transport during the Soviet years, few paved roads were built outside of urban areas. The percentage of people who own vehicles is still quite small in comparison to other developed countries.\n\nMaritime transport is crucial to foreign trade and also links the various regions of Russia, especially those along the Arctic seaboard. Because of ice, however, traffic on the Arctic Ocean route is seasonal. The busiest seaports are Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea, and St. Petersburg, on the Baltic. Inland waterways are also important in Russia. River traffic is heaviest on the Volga system.\n\nAir transportation has played an increasingly important role in the early 21st century. It accounts for about one-fifth of all passenger travel. Aeroflot (renamed Aeroflot-Russian Airlines in 2000), formerly the state airline of the Soviet Union, is the country’s largest air carrier. Only a tiny percentage of Russia’s freight is hauled by air. Air freight is confined chiefly to high-value items carried to and from remote parts of Siberia, where aircraft are sometimes the only means of transport. Most major Russian cities have air service to international or domestic locations.\n\nThe Russian telecommunications sector is inferior to those of other industrialized countries. For example, in the early 1990s only about one-third of the country’s households had a telephone. Largely through foreign investment, however, the country’s telecommunications infrastructure has been greatly improved. Cellular phone use in particular has proliferated, and they now greatly outnumber landlines. Internet use grew very slowly in the 1990s, particularly outside the cities, but it has since grown fairly steadily. Much of Russian television is under state control, although there are several independent commercial television stations, some with wide viewership. There are also hundreds of public and privately owned radio stations.\n\nGovernment\n\nWhile Russia was a Soviet republic, the government was dominated at all levels by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, under reforms introduced by Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, the communist grip loosened and Russia and the other republics gained more autonomy. In 1991 the communist government collapsed, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and Russia became an independent country.\n\nIn 1993 Russian voters approved a new constitution. It gives significant powers to the president, who is elected by popular vote. In 2008 an amendment to the constitution, which took effect with the 2012 election, extended the presidential term from four to six years. Prior to 2020 the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms, but constitutional changes enacted that year abolished term limits for the office. As Russia’s head of state, the president appoints the head of government (prime minister), key judges, and cabinet members. The president is also commander in chief of the armed forces. The constitution created the bicameral, or two-house, Federal Assembly as the country’s legislature. The upper house is the Federation Council, in which each of Russia’s administrative divisions has two representatives. The lower house is the State Duma, which has 450 members. All legislation must first pass the State Duma before being considered by the Federation Council.\n\nThe highest judicial body in Russia is the Supreme Court. It supervises the activities of all other judicial bodies and serves as the final court of appeal. There is also a Constitutional Court, which reviews Russian laws and treaties. Judges for both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court are nominated by the president and approved by the Federation Council.\n\nThe Russian constitution gives regional and local governments an array of powers. For example, they exercise authority over municipal property and policing, and they can impose regional taxes. Russia’s administrative divisions include oblasts (regions), minority republics, okrugs (autonomous districts), krays (territories), federal cities (Moscow and St. Petersburg), and one autonomous oblast. The power of these divisions was lessened in 2000 when the central government created seven federal districts—Central, Far East, Northwest, Siberia, Southern, Urals, and Volga. An eighth federal district, North Caucasus, was added in 2010. A ninth federal district was created in 2014 after Russia annexed the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea. This territorial claim was not recognized by Ukraine or most other countries, but Russia exercised de facto control of the region. Each federal district has its own presidential envoy with the power to implement federal law.\n\nHistory\n\nThe land that is now Russia has been inhabited since the second millennium bc. In ancient times waves of nomadic invasions occurred on the southern steppes. The earliest invaders included the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians. Later came the Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and Khazars.\n\nSlavs\n\nSlavic peoples originally lived over a large area of eastern Europe that included parts of what are now Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. In the 5th and 6th centuries ad the Slavs spread south and east, some of them into southern Russia.\n\nSlavic ethnic distinction probably crystallized during a period of peace brought about by the domination of the Volga trade route by the Khazars. Established in the late 6th century ad, the Khazar Empire stretched as far west as the Dnieper River by the second half of the 8th century.\n\nThe Slavs accepted the domination of the Khazars, as they had endured the brief occupations of the invaders who came before. Loosely knit and socially bound mainly by extended families, the Slavs focused predominantly on farming and welcomed the protection they received from powerful warriors such as the Khazars.\n\nKyivan Rus\n\nIn about 830 traders from Scandinavia moved southward into the north Volga region. These traders were known as the Rus—the source of the name Russia. Soon the Rus and other Scandinavian groups—together called the Varangians—extended their raiding down the main river routes toward the Middle East.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Slavs of Novgorod, tired of political turmoil, invited the Varangian prince Rurik to rule the city. He arrived in about 862 and established the dynasty that ruled various parts of East Slavic territory until 1598. After Rurik’s death his relative Oleg became ruler of Novgorod and in 882 added Kyiv (Kiev) to his domains, making it his capital. This was the beginning of Kyivan (Kievan) Rus, the first East Slavic state. Between about 930 and 1000 the Varangians developed a trade route from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, which became the basis of the Kyivan economy.\n\nThe chief architect of Kyivan Rus was Vladimir I, whose reign began in about 980. He expanded the realm and also developed a political structure for ruling the scattered territories. In 988 Vladimir became a Christian in the Byzantine, or Eastern Orthodox, tradition. Greek missionaries moved into Russia, bringing their religion and art and architecture. The missionaries also developed the Cyrillic alphabet. During the reigns of Vladimir and his son Yaroslav I, Kyivan Rus developed into a well-organized, democratic, urban, commercial society. At the height of its glory in the 11th century, Kyivan Rus was populated by seven to eight million people. It was the largest and most populous state in Europe.\n\nFollowing Yaroslav’s death in 1054, Kyivan Rus entered a long period of decay. Yaroslav’s sons divided the empire into warring factions. At the same time the trade route from the Black Sea to the Baltic declined in importance. By the middle of the 12th century Kyivan Rus had lost supremacy to independent principalities, including Novgorod and Vladimir.\n\nBetween 1238 and 1240 Kyivan Rus was finally crushed by the onslaught of the Mongols, who were also known as Tatars. The Mongols were under the leadership of Batu, grandson of Genghis Khan. The once-flourishing populace either perished or fled into the neighboring forests.\n\nMongol Rule\n\nThe Mongols formed a kingdom with a capital at Sarai on a tributary of the Volga River. The influence of the so-called “Golden Horde” was felt to some extent almost everywhere in Russia. They did not attempt to settle the land but exacted tribute through Russian intermediaries. Asian customs became a part of Russian culture, but as long as they paid tribute the Russians were free to practice their religion and native customs. The one principality that escaped Mongol domination was Novgorod in the north. During this period Novgorod joined the European trading consortium, the Hanseatic League, and flourished.\n\nIn the second half of the 14th century the Mongols began to weaken because of war and internal discord. The principality of Muscovy (Moscow), nestled deep in the forest at the hub of all the major trade routes, developed at the expense of the Mongols as their power declined. Muscovite princes, who efficiently collected the tribute demanded by the Mongols, enhanced their coffers through reward and fraud. As descendants of the Rurik line, Muscovite princes came to be looked upon by the people as justified leaders of all Russians.\n\nBy 1480 Ivan the Great, grand prince of Muscovy, had stopped paying tribute to the Mongols. The Mongols sent an army against him, but the army withdrew without a battle. Ivan had added Novgorod to his domains in 1478 and eventually spread Muscovy’s rule to the Arctic. Being free of serious Mongol threats was fortunate for Ivan, because after 1480 he was often faced with rebellion by family members and war with neighboring Lithuania.\n\nFirst Tsars\n\nIvan IV, called “the Terrible” because of his savage cruelty, ruled Muscovy from 1533 to 1584. In 1547 he crowned himself tsar—the Russian word for Caesar. Russian sovereigns now ruled as absolute monarchs. Ivan defeated the Mongol states of Kazan in 1552 and Astrakhan in 1556, making the Volga a wholly Russian river. In the 1580s he spread Muscovy’s rule into Siberia, but westward expansion was blocked. Ivan futilely engaged the Swedes, and Kyiv still lay deep within the powerful Polish-Lithuanian kingdom.\n\nIvan IV killed one of his sons. Another of his sons died at age nine. The remaining son, Fyodor, was mentally unfit to rule. During Fyodor’s 14-year reign as tsar, government affairs were dominated by his wife’s brother, Boris Godunov. Fyodor died childless in 1598, thus ending the Rurik Dynasty.\n\nGodunov was elected tsar to succeed Fyodor. He proved to be an able ruler, but, soon after he came to power, drought, famine, and plague devastated the people of Muscovy. Peasants fled their villages, leaving their holdings in weeds. In response Godunov decreed that the peasants were forbidden to leave the estates on which they were born. The peasants were thus bound to the soil, and serfdom began in Russia.\n\nGodunov died in 1605. His successor was murdered within a few months. Leaderless Russia was rife with dissension. For the next eight years it coped with civil wars, raids by Cossacks (peasants who had escaped serfdom) in the south, Polish invaders, and impostors pretending to be sons of Ivan IV and trying to claim the throne. The frustrated Russians in 1610 temporarily accepted the son of the Polish king as tsar, but Russian guerrilla forces later ousted the foreigners.\n\nRomanov Dynasty\n\nThe Russian nobility sought a new bloodline for the aristocracy. They found it in Michael Romanov, who was a young nobleman, or boyar. His election as tsar in 1613 began the Romanov Dynasty, which ruled until 1917.\n\nPeter and Catherine the Great\n\nThe Russian Empire—and with it the beginning of modern Russian history—dates from the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1725). Peter defeated Sweden in the Second Northern War (Great Northern War) and gained an outlet to the Baltic Sea. He founded a navy, introduced factories, reformed the administrative machinery, and organized a modern army. He forced education upon his officers and members of his court, many of whom could not read. He created a new Russian capital—St. Petersburg—on the Gulf of Finland.\n\nAlthough Peter died in 1725, his work survived almost half a century of incompetent rulers. Then Catherine the Great came to the throne in 1762. She again took up the task of reform. She also greatly expanded the Russian Empire. Her armies defeated Turkey, giving Russia control of the northern Black Sea coast and the Crimean Peninsula. During her reign Russia also acquired vast amounts of territory from Poland, which was partitioned three times.\n\nAlexander I and Nicholas I\n\nThe reign of Alexander I from 1801 to 1825 began in the spirit of Peter and Catherine, both of whom were Westernizers. Plans were drawn for a duma, or representative assembly, to propose new laws. Alexander had begun to carry out his program when Russia became involved in the Napoleonic wars. Reform was then abandoned as the government focused on defense.\n\nAlexander’s successor, Nicholas I, ruled from 1825 to 1855 and devoted his attention to protecting Russia against what he considered corrupting Western ideas. During his reign all democratic reform was suppressed.\n\nIn 1854 Russia became involved in the disastrous Crimean War, which lasted more than two years. The Russian people were tired of war, and the serfs rose against the landowners and burned and pillaged their estates.\n\nEmancipation of the serfs\n\nNicholas I was succeeded in 1855 by Alexander II. Distressed at the outcome of the Crimean War, which had demonstrated Russia’s backwardness, the new tsar introduced a series of reforms. The most important of these was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, giving liberty to tens of millions of people. Another reform introduced self-governing local assemblies elected by the people.\n\nThe long years of tyranny and lack of progress, however, had produced discontent, especially among the young with university educations. Revolutionary activity, which had been brewing since an unsuccessful revolt against the tsar in December 1825, developed rapidly. In 1881 Alexander II was assassinated by a bomb hurled at his carriage. His murder set off waves of violence, much of which was directed at the Jewish population of the empire(see pogrom). Alexander II was succeeded by his son Alexander III, a Russian nationalist and no friend of reformers. Under Alexander III revolutionary organizations were completely suppressed.\n\nThe last tsar\n\nNicholas II, son of Alexander III, came to power in 1894. Weak-willed and indecisive, he was unsuited for the task of ruling a vast empire. In 1904 Russia and Japan went to war over Russia’s expansionist activities in the Far East. The war was unpopular in Russia. The country suffered a terrible defeat, encouraging greater revolutionary activity.\n\nAlthough small, a new factory laboring class was organized by the revolutionaries. Peasants sympathized and helped. Mutinies broke out in the army and navy. Manufacturers and landlords demanded reforms that would satisfy workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Revolution of 1905 reached its climax with a general strike and the formation of a soviet, or workers’ council, in St. Petersburg. In response, Nicholas called for the election of a duma as proposed by his ancestor Alexander I a century before.\n\nIn August 1914 Russia went to war against Germany and Austria over conflicting claims in the Balkans. The peasants and workers at first accepted the war without protest, but great military failures resulted because of the Russian government’s inability to equip its armies. Millions of Russian lives were sacrificed. The attitude of the public toward the war and the government changed.\n\nFood shortages in early 1917 sparked mass rioting in the capital of Petrograd (the name given to St. Petersburg in August 1914). Soldiers deserted the government and joined the people. The Duma demanded that the tsar step down. Nicholas II abdicated his throne on March 15, ending more than 300 years of rule by the Romanov Dynasty. He and his family were exiled to Siberia and later executed.(See also World War I.)\n\nThe Soviet Union\n\nIn the second phase of the Russian Revolution, in October 1917, a group of radical socialists called the Bolsheviks, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, emerged as the preeminent power in Russia. In 1918 they changed their name to the Russian Communist Party. Between 1918 and 1920 the Red Army successfully defended the new government against anticommunist forces in a civil war.\n\nThe communist government officially established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on December 30, 1922. The Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic dominated the Soviet Union for its entire 74-year history. It was by far the largest of the republics, and Moscow, its capital, was also the capital of the Soviet Union. (For a detailed history of the Soviet period, see Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.)\n\nThe Yeltsin Presidency\n\nFollowing years of economic decline and political turmoil, the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991. Boris Yeltsin, leader of the former Russian republic, became president of the independent Russian Federation. Russia joined with 11 other former Soviet republics to form a new organization called the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nRussia entered the post-Soviet era on the verge of economic collapse. Production plummeted while inflation soared. Manufacturing, geared toward defense and heavy industrial products during the Soviet years, was inefficient and unprepared for the production of consumer goods. Essential everyday goods were in short supply.\n\nYeltsin’s government began the difficult task of transforming the government-run Soviet economy into one based on private enterprise. Among other reforms, the government transferred control of most industries to the private sector. Privatization did little to improve the living conditions of the average Russian, however. It mainly benefited a select group of individuals who, because of their political connections, were able to buy companies for much less than they were worth. These individuals, called “oligarchs,” came to control huge segments of the Russian economy.\n\nYeltsin’s reform efforts were complicated by conflicts with the legislature. The constitution, held over from the Soviet era, did not specify which branch, legislative or executive, held supreme power. Yeltsin’s supporters argued that ultimate power rested with the president. His opponents—led by hard-line communists—held that the legislature was sovereign. Political differences made the power struggle even more intense. After Yeltsin dissolved the parliament in September 1993, its supporters rose up in armed rebellion. Yeltsin used the army to seize the parliament building and arrest the legislators inside. A new constitution, introduced by Yeltsin and adopted in December 1993, gave the president vast powers.\n\nAnother pressing issue in post-Soviet Russia was ethnic relations. Ethnic minorities made up more than one-fifth of Russia’s population. Many groups demanded more autonomy, or even complete independence. The republic of Chechnya, in the Caucasus region, declared independence in 1991, before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In late 1994 Yeltsin sent Russian troops into Chechnya, but they could not completely suppress the rebels. In 1996 a cease-fire was signed and Russian troops withdrew.\n\nThe war in Chechnya and the failure of his reforms to spur economic growth caused Yeltsin’s popularity to plummet. Nevertheless, the president displayed his remarkable staying power by winning reelection over his communist party challenger in 1996.\n\nYeltsin’s second term was tumultuous. Beset by declining health, the president faced continuing clashes with the parliament, including calls for his resignation. In 1998 the country faced a severe financial crisis and the collapse of the national currency, the ruble. Partly to maintain his grip on power, Yeltsin dismissed four prime ministers and in 1998 fired his entire cabinet. In 1999 the Duma tried unsuccessfully to impeach Yeltsin. Ever unpredictable, Yeltsin announced his resignation on December 31, 1999.\n\nPutin Succeeds Yeltsin\n\nVladimir Putin, Yeltsin’s final prime minister, followed him as president. He declared his priorities to be reestablishing a strong state, restoring law and order, and relaunching economic reform. As prime minister, Putin had blamed Chechen rebels for a series of terrorist bombings and launched a new military campaign in Chechnya. Although Russian troops won control of the region, Chechen rebels continued a guerrilla war against Russian forces and terrorist attacks against civilians.\n\nPutin sought to reassert central control over Russia’s wayward regions by reorganizing them into seven new federal districts, each headed by a representative appointed by the president. He also moved to reduce the power of Russia’s unpopular business elite—the infamous oligarchs—by closing several media outlets and launching criminal proceedings against numerous leading figures. Economic reforms brought about a strong recovery from the recession of the 1990s. Despite criticism that Putin had concentrated too much power in the presidency and was lessening freedoms achieved when the Soviet Union broke apart, he remained popular and was reelected in 2004.\n\nMedvedev as President\n\nAlthough Putin’s popularity continued to be high during his second term, the constitution prevented him from running for another term. Putin’s chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, was easily elected president and took office in May 2008. Medvedev appointed Putin as prime minister, giving the former president a platform to extend his influence in Russian politics.\n\nA few months after gaining office, Medvedev was faced with a growing military conflict within Russia’s neighboring country of Georgia. South Ossetia, a region of Georgia that borders Russia, was fighting to win its independence. Russia sent thousands of troops to support the rebels not only in South Ossetia but also in Abkhazia, another separatist region of Georgia. Even after a cease-fire was declared, tensions remained high.\n\nMeanwhile, sporadic fighting between Russian forces and local rebels continued elsewhere in the Caucasus region. In 2009 Medvedev announced the end of Russia’s counterinsurgency operations in Chechnya, but outbreaks of violence continued there and in neighboring republics. In early 2010 suicide bombers who were believed to be linked to Caucasus militants killed more than three dozen people on the Moscow subway.\n\nPutin’s Presidential Return\n\nIn the presidential elections of 2012, Putin was elected to a third term as president of Russia. One of his first acts was to nominate Medvedev as prime minister, a move that was orchestrated between the two leaders a year earlier. Putin’s first months in office were marked by attempts to quash or marginalize protest movements against the government that had materialized in the past few years.\n\nPutin also took an active role in the events in neighboring Ukraine, where a protest movement toppled the country’s pro-Russian government in early 2014. Putin’s administration did not recognize the resultant acting government. Armed men (whose uniforms lacked visible insignia but were thought to be Russians) took control of key sites in the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea. Shortly thereafter, Crimea declared independence from Ukraine and was annexed by Russia. The United States and the European Union responded by enacting sanctions against high-ranking officials in Russia and in the self-declared government of Crimea. After pro-Russian separatists occupied government buildings throughout southeastern Ukraine, Ukrainian forces retaliated. Although Putin denied that Russia was connected with the rebels, Western intelligence agencies, NATO, and the Ukrainian government documented multiple instances of troops and matériel crossing into Ukraine from Russia. Putin later publicly declared his support for the separatists but reiterated the claim that Russia was not involved in the conflict, which claimed thousands of lives. Western countries enacted a series of sanctions against Russia that included limiting Russian access to international capital markets. Those measures, combined with plummeting oil prices, sent the Russian economy into a recession in early 2015. Putin and other world leaders eventually approved a peace plan aimed at ending the conflict in southeastern Ukraine, though fighting in the region continued.\n\nRussian activities in Ukraine were part of a wider effort to assert military influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. In September 2015 Russia entered the Syrian Civil War in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia had long provided weapons and political support to Assad. Russia’s ensuing military campaign in Syria allowed the Assad government, which had been on the verge of collapse, to regain momentum against rebel groups and Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces.\n\nFollowing the victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had engaged in a systematic effort to influence the election in Trump’s favor. That effort reportedly involved the hacking of e-mails of members of the Democratic National Committee and the release of those documents through the media organization WikiLeaks. U.S. authorities opened an investigation into possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign advisers. For his part, Putin denied the existence of any campaign to influence the election. In July 2017 the U.S. Congress voted to impose tougher sanctions on Russia as punishment for its meddling in the 2016 election and for its military actions in Ukraine and elsewhere.\n\nIn December 2017 Putin declared his intention to seek reelection as president. As the March 2018 election approached, it seemed all but certain that Putin would win by a wide margin. Aleksey Navalny, a prominent opposition leader, was barred from running. Other opposition candidates faced incessant criticism from state-run media. As expected, Putin claimed an overwhelming majority of the vote. The independent monitoring agency Golos characterized the election as being rife with irregularities, however. With the win, Putin secured a fourth presidential term.\n\nIn January 2020 Putin announced his intention to modify the Russian constitution and remove term limits for presidents, paving the way for him to remain in office indefinitely. Medvedev soon announced his resignation, stating that a new government would give Putin “the opportunity to make the decisions he needs to make.” The Russian legislature quickly approved the constitutional changes. Putin then scheduled a national referendum on the matter. That vote was originally scheduled for April, but it was postponed until July because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The referendum results affirmed Putin’s agenda. Opposition groups noted that there was no independent monitoring of the election process, however.\n\nRussia was hit especially hard by the pandemic. By the end of 2021 more than 650,000 Russians had been killed by COVID-19.\n\nRussia-Ukraine War\n\nIn early 2022 the prospect of a major war in Europe began to dominate global headlines, as Putin continued a massive buildup of Russian forces along the Ukrainian border. On February 21 Putin recognized the independence of two separatist-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian “peacekeepers” into Ukrainian territory. On the morning of February 24 Putin delivered a televised address announcing the beginning of a “special military operation.” Within minutes Russian air strikes were carried out against cities across Ukraine. Many world leaders condemned Putin’s unprovoked attack and promised severe sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe sanctions that followed included the removal of key Russian banks from SWIFT, the main global financial messaging system, and a U.S. ban on imports of Russian oil and natural gas. Despite the raft of sanctions and the crushing effects they had on Russia’s economy, Russian troops and armored vehicles continued to pour into Ukraine. Deadly air strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities also persisted. In early March the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the invasion of Ukraine and to demand that Russia “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw” its forces from the country. However, as Russia increasingly faced isolation on the world stage, its devastating attacks on Ukraine continued.\n\nOver the following months Western countries provided billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, whose forces were able to repel Russia’s main thrust toward Kyiv by April. The Russian military also met stiff resistance elsewhere. In September the Ukrainians launched a surprise counterattack in the Kharkiv region that drove Russian forces from the area. In the wake of that counterattack Putin called up 300,000 reservists to active military duty to support the war in Ukraine. He also threatened to deploy nuclear weapons, insisting that his threat was “not a bluff.” In late September Russia annexed four regions of eastern Ukraine that remained under Russian military control. The international community widely condemned the annexation as illegal."
