        "text": "Bitterly cold, stark uncompromising weather was the perfect backdrop to my visit to Yekaterinburg in Russia to photograph an iconic landmark, the beautiful Constructivist White Tower built in 1931 by Moisei Reischer.\n\nAs I put on my double layer of socks, double layer of trousers and Canadian winter boots capable of crushing any opposition on the London Tube in seconds, I mused that it was a shame the snow-boots weigh a ton or I’d pop them on every morning just to stampede my way to a seat. I’d been told to wrap up for my visit to the White Tower, it was already minus 12 degrees outside …in typical Russian style, indoors a tropical 78 degrees, whipping layers of clothing on and off had become an art-form.\n\nMy guide and archi-hero was Evgeny Volkov, a key member of the Podelniki Architectural Group and a driving force in the White Tower Project. One of its missions is to protect what was, in its day, the world’s largest water tower and is today an iconic structure admired worldwide. Podelniki wants to ensure that the White Tower continues to be sympathetically restored, brought back to life properly understood and protected for future generations.\n\nEvgeny Volkov, Polina Ivanova and Antonina Savilova studied architecture together and formed Podelniki as a club, the name translates as partners in crime. Their raison d’etre was and remains to promote the development of architecture, history, culture and art – they’re now professional architects and their club has morphed into an association has gone from strength to strength. What’s so refreshing is that they are determined not to be a closed clique, they want as many people as possible to engage and enjoy their projects Early in their careers they recognized how important Yekaterinburg’s Constructivist architecture was, and as students held the city’s first online Architecture Day celebrating Russian architecture.\n\nThe White Tower wasn’t the only formerly loved building on their radar in Russia’s fourth largest City and industrial heartland, but it was iconic. When a vacuum occurred when the Red Cross vacated the building in 2006 a real risk arose. With no maintenance programme in place and no protection by 2012, local reports suggested it was in danger of being pulled down, which would have been tragic. The ‘partners in crime’ stepped in to save the unique monument of constructivist architecture. Determined and with an understanding of how to apply to get a protected status, Podelniki successfully registered their fledgeling organization to manage the tower. Of course, there can be a gap between aspiration and reality as the magnitude of the task unfolded. Working together with the Editor of Tatlin publishing house, a local lawyer and the Uralmash museum they contacted the architect’s family. Luckily they still had Moisei Reischer’s archive. It turned out that as recently as 1971, Reischer had hoped to convert his beloved water tower into a café with a birds-eye view of the city. What a cracking idea, but having headed up and down the internal staircases it was hard to imagine how that goal could be achieved\n\nDespite seeing photos of Moisei Reischer’s Constructivist 1931White Tower, nothing prepared me for its scale, beauty and otherworldliness when I visited it with Evgeny. It’s hard to describe the interior, photos do it visual justice but cannot capture the atmosphere. It struck me that the designer might have had a dreamy vision of a future Soyuz space capsule. The enormous water tank high above the ground feels as if it has the capability to separate and take off. To give a sense of the scale it could comfortably seat two dozen people on the edge of the tank and as you can see it’s been utilized as a drawing board. The fixtures and fittings of the tank now look mysterious and reminiscent of the Kola super borehole. The design is informed by the height, the concrete, the deep metal internal well and the open views in the round. It does not feel rooted the earth beneath, it sort of hovers over the city, a brilliant space which was so nearly lost."
