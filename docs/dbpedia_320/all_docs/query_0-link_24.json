        "text": "Important notice from the Editor in Chief\n\nMaintaining our Russian site is a delicate matter during the war. We have chosen to keep its content online to help our readers, but we cannot ensure that it is accurate and up to date. Our team endeavors to strike the right balance between giving information to those who need it, and respecting the gravity of the situation.\n\nSchool holidays in Russia vary according to what type of school your child attends. If you are a parent that lives and works in Russia, you will need to check with your child’s school for exact dates so that you can plan accordingly. State schools in Russia have a break in each of the four seasons plus an additional break in February for first graders. International schools have slightly different timetables. All schools also have additional days off throughout the year for nationally observed holidays and school-related events.\n\nThis guide cover all the essentials about school holidays in Russia, and includes the following:\n\nSchool holidays in Russia\n\nState and private independent schools have different holiday calendars in Russia. State schools in Russia follow a timetable set out by the Ministry of Education, but the regional authorities and schools have some freedom in deciding when holidays fall. It is essential to check holiday dates with your school, as they can vary.\n\nThe school year starts on or near 1 September.\n\nThe holidays are spread across the four seasons. Schools with a semester system have a 10-day break in autumn, an 11-day break in winter, a nine-day break in spring, and a break of around three months for summer (plus first graders get an extra 10-day break in February). Those with a trimester system have the same number of holidays but they might vary in length.\n\nEducation\n\nPrimary education in Russia\n\nRead more\n\nPrivately run international schools in Russia can set their own school holidays. Most follow a similar pattern of breaks – autumn, winter, spring, and summer – with the main differences being:\n\nLonger winter break: Russia follows the Orthodox Christmas calendar which celebrates Christmas Day on 7 January (Gregorian calendar). State schools typically don’t break up until the end of December. International schools usually close a few days before 25 December.\n\nDifferent dates for all breaks: Some international schools also have shorter autumn and spring breaks.\n\nAdditional holidays: Many international schools have an additional holiday of a few days around May. Some schools may break for a week or more at Easter (which often falls after the spring break).\n\nRussian school holiday dates 2022–2023\n\nThe following is an estimate of school holidays in Russian state schools for 2022–2023:\n\nAutumn break: 29 October – 7 November 2022\n\nWinter break: 31 December 2022 – 8 January 2023\n\nExtra break for first graders: 20–26 February 2022\n\nSpring break: 24 March – 2 April 2023\n\nSummer break: 1 June – 31 August 2023\n\nAll dates are subject to change.\n\nRussian school holiday dates 2023–24\n\nSchool holidays in Russian state schools for 2023–2024 are:\n\nAutumn break: 30 October – 5 November 2023\n\nWinter break: 1 January 2024 – 7 January 2024\n\nExtra break for first graders: 19–25 February 2024\n\nSpring break: 25–31 March 2024\n\nSummer break: 26 May – 31 August 2024\n\nSchools following the trimester system have the following holiday schedule:\n\nFirst trimester holidays: 9–15 October 2023\n\nEnd of first trimester holiday: 20–26 November 2023\n\nSecond trimester holidays: 1–7 January 2024\n\nEnd of second trimester holidays: 19–25 February 2024\n\nThird trimester holidays: 8–14 April 2024\n\nSummer break: 26 May – 31 August 2024\n\nAll dates are subject to change.\n\nAdditional holidays and days off\n\nAs well as the standard school holidays in Russia, there are a number of additional public holiday dates when most schools will be shut. These include Fatherland Day (23 February), International Women’s Day (8 March), Russia Day (12 June), and Unity Day (4 November).\n\nMost schools also have their own timetable of dates when there will be no school due to things such as staff training, pupil book days, or regional holidays. Consult your child’s school for a full list of these dates. Many schools also publish a full calendar on their website. International schools that publish online calendars include:\n\nBritish International School Moscow\n\nEnglish International School Moscow\n\nInternational School of Moscow\n\nLycée Français\n\nChildcare during school holidays in Russia\n\nIf you are working during the school holidays, you may need to make childcare arrangements. There are public and private kindergartens in Russia, some of which take children up until the age of 8. Public provision has declined since the end of the Soviet era and there tends to be more facilities in the busier cities. Check with your regional authority (область or oblast in Russian) for more information.\n\nHoliday and recreational programs for children and teenagers run in many areas. You can find information and search for local programs in your area from the Ministry of Education and Science.\n\nThere is also a variety of summer camps and seasonal activities for all ages run by private organizations in Russia. Costs and availability for these vary. You can search for programs on Russian sites such as My Camp and Best Camp. There is also EuroClub which runs camps in each of the school holidays in the Moscow region. Some of the international schools run their own holiday provision for pupils so it’s worth asking for details."
