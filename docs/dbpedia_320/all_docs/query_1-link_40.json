Adjust future predictions accordingly.\n\nThe 1982 zone shift in Pacific/Easter has been corrected, fixing a 2015a regression.\n\nSome more zones have been turned into links, when they differed from existing zones only for older time stamps. As usual, these changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only. Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file. The affected zones are: America/Antigua, America/Cayman, Pacific/Midway, and Pacific/Saipan.\n\nCorrect the 1992-2010 DST abbreviation in Volgograd from \"MSK\" to \"MSD\". tzdata2015a\n\n2015/01/29 8u45\n\n7u80\n\n6u95\n\n5.0u85 2.0.0\n\n1.4.11 The Mexican state of Quintana Roo, represented by America/Cancun, will shift from Central Time with DST to Eastern Time without DST on 2015-02-01 at 02:00.\n\nChile will not change clocks in April or thereafter; its new standard time will be its old daylight saving time.

As usual, these changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only. Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file. The affected zones are: Africa/Blantyre, Africa/Bujumbura, Africa/Gaborone, Africa/Harare, Africa/Kigali, Africa/Lubumbashi, Africa/Lusaka, Africa/Maseru, and Africa/Mbabane. tzdata2014g\n\n2014/08/28 1.4.7 Turks & Caicos is switching from US eastern time to UTC-4 year-round, modeled as a switch from EST/EDT to AST on 2014-11-02 at 02:00.\n\nTime in Russia or the USSR before 1926 or so has been corrected by a few seconds in the following zones: Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Tbilisi, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Europe/Riga, Europe/Samara. For Asia/Yekaterinburg the correction is a few minutes.\n\nThe Portuguese decree of 1911-05-26 took effect on 1912-01-01.

Also, Lisbon's pre-1912 GMT offset was -0:36:45 (rounded from -0:36:44.68), not -0:36:32.\n\nAsia/Dhaka ended DST on 2009-12-31 at 24:00, not 23:59. tzdata2014f\n\n2014/08/05 1.4.6 Russia will subtract an hour from most of its time zones on 2014-10-26 at 02:00 local time. There are a few exceptions: Magadan Oblast (Asia/Magadan) and Zabaykalsky Krai are subtracting two hours; conversely, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug (Asia/Anadyr), Kamchatka Krai (Asia/Kamchatka), Kemerovo Oblast (Asia/Novokuznetsk), and the Samara Oblast and the Udmurt Republic (Europe/Samara) are not changing their clocks. The changed zones are Europe/Kaliningrad, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Simferopol, Europe/Volgograd, Asia/Yekaterinburg, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Novosibirsk, Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Sakhalin, and Asia/Ust-Nera; Asia/Magadan will have two hours subtracted; and Asia/Novokuznetsk's time zone abbreviation is affected, but not its UTC offset. Two zones are added: Asia/Chita (split from Asia/Yakutsk, and also with two hours subtracted) and Asia/Srednekolymsk (split from Asia/Magadan, but with only one hour subtracted).\n\nAustralian eastern time zone abbreviations are now AEST/AEDT not EST, and similarly for the other Australian zones. That is, for eastern standard and daylight saving time the abbreviations are AEST and AEDT instead of the former EST for both; similarly, ACST/ACDT, ACWST/ACWDT, and AWST/AWDT are now used instead of the former CST, CWST, and WST. This change does not affect UTC offsets, only time zone abbreviations.\n\nAsia/Novokuznetsk shifts from NOVT to KRAT (remaining on UTC+7) effective 2014-10-26 at 02:00 local time.\n\nThe time zone abbreviation for Xinjiang Time (observed in Ürümqi) has been changed from URUT to XJT.\n\nPrefer MSK/MSD for Moscow time in Russia, even in other cities. Similarly, prefer EET/EEST for eastern European time in Russia.\n\nChange time zone abbreviations in (western) Samoa to use \"ST\" and \"DT\" suffixes, as this is more likely to match common practice. Prefix \"W\" to (western) Samoa time when its standard-time offset disagrees with that of American Samoa.\n\nAmerica/Metlakatla now uses PST, not MeST, to abbreviate its time zone.\n\nTime zone abbreviations have been updated for Japan's two time zones used 1896-1937. JWST now stands for Western Standard Time, and JCST for Central Standard Time (formerly this was CJT). These abbreviations are now used for time in Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin while controlled by Japan. tzdata2014e\n\n2014/06/12 1.4.5 Egypt's 2014 Ramadan-based transitions are June 26 and July 31 at 24:00. Guess that from 2015 on Egypt will temporarily switch to standard time at 24:00 the last Thursday before Ramadan, and back to DST at 00:00 the first Friday after Ramadan.\n\nSimilarly, Morocco's are June 28 at 03:00 and August 2 at 02:00. Guess that from 2015 on Morocco will temporarily switch to standard time at 03:00 the last Saturday before Ramadan, and back to DST at 02:00 the first Saturday after Ramadan.\n\nThe abbreviation \"MSM\" (Moscow Midsummer Time) is now used instead of \"MSD\" for Moscow's double daylight time in summer 1921. Also, a typo \"VLASST\" has been repaired to be \"VLAST\" for Vladivostok summer time in 1991. tzdata2014d\n\n2014/05/27 zic no longer generates files containing time stamps well before the Big Bang.\n\nThis works around GNOME bug 730332 tzdata2014c\n\n2014/05/13 8u11\n\n7u65\n\n6u81\n\n5.0u71 1.4.4 Egypt observes DST starting 2014-05-15 at 24:00.\n\nDetails have not been announced, except that DST will not be observed during Ramadan.
