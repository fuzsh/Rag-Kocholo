        "text": "Editor’s note: This is the third part of Janet Landfried’s story of a trip on the Zarengold train on the Trans-Siberian Railroad from Moscow to Beijing in September. Traveling with Landfried were Diann Rector of Corona, Barbara Krause of Redlands and Jeff Abuhl of Phoenix. As Part 3 begins, they are on the way to Kazan on the Volga River.\n\nBy Janet Landfried\n\nWe rolled along and settled into a routine on the train. There were two toilets at the end of our car. It was a newer car, so both toilets were vacuum assisted, as on an airplane. With toilets on other cars, it was, “Oh, I see the tracks.”\n\nTwo attendants were assigned to each car, and they were available 24 hours a day. They cleaned the lavatories once an hour, or as needed.\n\nOur Standard Class car had a maximum of 36 people although we were not full. The Classic had a maximum of 18. There was minimal space for luggage, so we brought soft luggage that could be stuffed under the beds.\n\nWe did not have a shower room in our car; it was in the car ahead. We had to gather our toiletries and towels and negotiate to that car to enjoy a 15-minutes shower. That was after we signed up for a time slot. Soap was provided. Laundry was a hit-or-miss affair, but the walls of our cars were heated, so laundry was “hung” on the handrail under the windows.\n\nEach car had a samovar for hot water. You take your own teabags. The water for that and the water circulating in the walls of our car was heated by burning coal. At one stop we saw workers shoveling coal into buckets for each car. That was part of the nostalgia of riding the Trans-Siberian Railroad.\n\nThe first stop was Kazan, capital of Tatarstan, one of republics in the Russian Federation. On the banks of the Volga River, it is a multi-ethnic city, predominantly Tartar, who are Muslim. Next in population are the Russians, who are Russian Orthodox. The Vikings were here centuries ago as were the Mongols of Ghengis Khan.\n\nWe visited the Kremlin of Kazan, kremlin being the walled area of a city where the political and religious power was concentrated. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it includes both a cathedral and a mosque. The site of the Kremlin was lovely with flowers, neat and tidy, and with freshly painted buildings.\n\nThe city has hosted world championships in fencing and aquatics and will be one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. A new stadium for soccer has been built and the city is looking to increase tourism.\n\nWe had a city tour followed by a bountiful lunch in a restaurant. Our closing event was a concert of classical music performed by students at a conservatory. This was to be one of many cultural performances we enjoyed on the trip.\n\nBack on the train — dinner and bed! After several days of walking and climbing stairs, I was beat. The first night on the train had not been relaxing, as we were getting adjusted to the noise and swaying. Learning the toilets, signing up for showers and meeting our travel companions left me exhausted.\n\nThe previous night we set our clocks two hours ahead; this night we set them two more hours ahead. Nothing like losing four hours in a day, and we weren’t even flying. We would have one more time change when we crossed into Mongolia.\n\nThe next morning we arrived in Yekaterinburg in the Ural Federal District. It is a city of more than 1.5 million people and was founded in the 18th century. That makes it a rather young city, as Moscow was founded in the 12th century. It was near here that Francis Gary Powers and his U-2 American spy plane were shot down in 1960.\n\nIn Yekaterinburg we had what was for me an important visit of the trip. In July 1918, Czar and Czarina Nicholas II and Alexandra, their five children and four servants were executed in Yekaterinburg, ending the Romanov Dynasty. It was part of the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, leading the way for the Bolsheviks to take control of the country. The execution took place in the basement of the mansion where they were staying when they were sent into exile from St. Petersburg.\n\nThe family was buried in a grave in the nearby woods. Their remains were re-interred in St. Petersburg in 1998 and the family was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. I visited their tombs in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg.\n\nBoris Yeltsin had the building where the execution took place torn down but in recent years a church and museum were built on the site. We toured the museum of the Church on the Blood, built in the traditional Russian fashion with golden domes. There is an extensive retelling of the tragic events that took place there — very sobering.\n\nWe then went into the countryside for a stop at a mass grave where more than 18,500 people were buried in the woods. It was part of Stalin’s purge in 1937-38. This area in the Ural Mountains did not support Stalin’s regime, and they paid the price — just some of the millions who suffered that fate. This was another sobering monument of Russia’s often bloody history.\n\nNext stop was an obelisk for the imaginary line between Europe and Asia. We had crossed the divide between the two continents and were now truly in Siberia. It was a photo op where we could straddle the continents. After our last two stops, it was a place to have some fun. We were also entertained by some local musicians.\n\nLeaving Yekaterinburg, we rolled across the steppes of Siberia on our way to Novosibirsk. The taiga forests were punctuated with small towns, factories in the distance and fields of grain.\n\nThe railroad opened Siberia to settlements, farms and mining. There are extensive ore deposits and minerals here, in addition to precious stones, oil and gold. Most are within 125 miles of the main line.\n\nNovosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia with more than 1.5 million people. Founded in 1893 with the start of construction of the railroad, it is a young city compared to the rest of Russia. There is more modern architecture and wider, straighter streets.\n\nNovosibirsk is the location of the largest ballet and opera house in the country. Named the Bolshoi, it is an elegant building, inside and out. “Romeo and Juliet” was playing that night, but we had to move on.\n\nThe trip dispelled our stereotype of Siberia. It should no longer be portrayed as a dark, bleak, cold, soulless place. We found it bright, vibrant and bustling. The new generation is finding its place in a capitalist society; the older folks who remember Soviet times are dying off.\n\nOur guide told us when she was in school under communism, children were not taught history. Apparently it was better to not know.\n\nNovosibirsk is home now to universities, technology schools, art and dance conservatories. People are dressed fashionably and cell phones are ubiquitous. I’m sure there are problems as in any country but as a casual visitor, I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.\n\nWe woke to a view of some trees that had lost their leaves, but the aspens were golden and quaking in the breeze. It had rained, and this day would probably be the coldest of our trip.\n\nAs we approached the city of Krasnoyarsk, we passed little towns, typical of what we saw all along the way — wood houses and shacks with corrugated steel roofs, weathered in this harsh climate. We hadn’t seen much livestock but each home had a vegetable garden and some flowers.\n\nKrasnoyarsk was a delightful surprise. Set amid rolling hills covered in the forest of conifers and deciduous trees now in gold leaf, it originated as a fort in 1623. The mighty Yenisey (Yenisei) River flows through the city on its way to the Arctic Ocean. Author Anton Chekhov called Krasnoyarsk the most beautiful city in Siberia.\n\nWe drove through wooded areas and up a hill to an overlook with a statue of a sturgeon, the fabled queenfish of caviar. There were dramatic views overlooking the river.\n\nThere is a nature preserve near here that draws many visitors but we did not have time to stop. There was more than a hint of rain; this was the only day on the trip that we had inclement weather.\n\nEarly in World War II, the Soviets dismantled entire factories in European Russia and reassembled them in Siberia. Krasnoyarsk received 40 such factories and the population of the city increased dramatically. Housing was needed, so everywhere you see the multiple-storied block apartment buildings typical in Russian cities.\n\nA short visit, way too short, was to a museum housed in a small ship of discovery. Nikolai Razenov was an explorer who sailed along the Aleutian chain and down the western coast of America. In 2007 San Francisco’s Mayor Gavin Newsom issued a proclamation commemorating the 200th anniversary of Rezanov’s visit. That proclamation is in this museum.\n\nPlace names along the California coast such as the Russian River and Russian Hill in San Francisco are reminders of that period of discovery and settlement.\n\nIn 1817 the Russians built Fort Elizabeth in my hometown of Waimea, Kauai. Last year was its bicentennial year. I found it compelling to see the connections we have to the seemingly remote areas of Siberia and pulled up memories of the past.\n\nWe returned to our train with the threat of rain. There was no rain but as we continued east there were puddles in the streets of the villages.\n\nIn the morning, approaching Irkutsk, the taiga forest was replaced with rolling hills and farms. We saw fewer trees and more grasslands. In the far distance to our south were snow-covered mountains.\n\nJoin me next week as we visit Irkutsk and Lake Baikal.\n\nJanet Landfried taught social studies at Redlands High School and Redlands East Valley High School for many years and retired in 2001."
