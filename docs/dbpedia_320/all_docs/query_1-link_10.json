Our calculator attempts to determine the correct time zone for the given location and date, but because time zones and the start and end dates of Daylight Saving Time sometimes change, this value may not be accurate for historical or future dates.\n\nClick the Show Sunrise, Show Sunset and Show Azimuth checkboxes to display color-coded lines on the map indicating the direction of sunrise, sunset and solar position based on the Local Time and Date entered.\n\nThis solar calculator is provided for research and entertainment purposes only. Due to variable atmospheric conditions and uncertainty inherent in the algorithms used, the actual observed values of sunrise, sunset and solar position may differ from the results presented here.\n\nQuestions?\n\nFeel free to write to us with any questions or comments at Webmaster.\n\nSolar Calculation Resources:"
