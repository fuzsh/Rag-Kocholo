You can plan your stops in cities alÐ¾ng the way and book trains using the Trans-Siberian timetable above, or book one of our tours.\n\nMoscow is connected by direct trains with Paris, Berlin, Helsinki, Nice, Prague, Vienna, Warsaw etc. It's also easy to travel from London to Moscow by connecting several trains - start your Trans-Siberian trip with Eurostar from London to Paris and then a ride on the excellent Paris-Moscow Express!\n\nIt can be a great idea to combine your Trans-Siberian journey with visiting other places along the way - be it Mongolia, China, South Korea, Japan or North Korea. We will be glad to help you get the most out of your time in this part of the world\n\nDon't miss Baikal Lake\n\nIt is the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world, containing roughly 20% of the world's unfrozen surface fresh water, the world's deepest lake, one of the world's clearest and is the world's oldest lake. Make a stop-over in Irkutsk to visit this beauty\n\nMake a stop-over in Mongolia\n\nMongolia is known as the 'Land of Blue Skies', it has over 260 sunny days each year - make a stop over in Ulaanbaator, the Mongolian capital, and pay a visit to the hometown of Genghis Khan - DelÃ¼Ã¼n Boldog, near the mountain Burkhan Khaldun\n\nGo all the way to North Korea\n\nIt is a great idea to combine your Trans-Siberian trip with an adventure to the most mysterious country in the world. You can travel from Moscow all the way through Siberia to Tumangang - the gateway to the DPRK\n\nWhen to go\n\nYou can go at any time of year as the Trans-Siberian Railway operates all year round. Naturally, the summer months from May to September have the best weather and the longest daylight hours so are the most popular. In winter (except for Christmas and New Year holidays) it's easier to get tickets, the trains are warmly heated and the Siberian landscape beautiful in the snow, but the hours of daylight will be shorter and stretching your legs at stations or visiting the cities will be chillier. In many ways it's the slushy thaw around April that's least attractive.\n\nOn board\n\nOn the regular public trains, bedding is supplied in first- and second-class carriages, the berths being folded into seats by day. Each sleeping-car has at least two western-style toilets and a washroom with sinks. The only public trains offering showers for a small fee are the Trans-Mongolian MoscowâBeijing train (train 3/4), and Rossiya Moscow-Vladivostok train (train 1/2) - these trains offer a shower hose in the small shared bathroom located in a special household carriage.\n\nEach carriage has a (male) provodnik or more usually a (female) provodnitsa who cleans, maintains the samovar and puts out steps at stations, so itâs as well to keep on the right side of them.\n\nFood & drink\n\nFood quality is generally adequate, though menus are limited, in Russia typically ham and fried eggs for breakfast, schnitzel and potatoes for lunch or dinner, with soups and salads for starters. Beer, Russian champagne, vodka, chocolate and snacks are sold at the bar. The Mongolian Railways restaurant car normally serves rice and mutton, while the Chinese dining car has a good variety of Chinese dishes.\n\nIn every train car there is a pot with boiling water available for making hot drinks (bring your own tea, but the water is free). Carriage attendants also sell tea and coffee, and it's usually possible to buy soft drinks and beer in the restaurant carriage to bring back to your carriage.\n\nStops at stations allow food to be bought from platform vendors or shops; fare depends on location and season, but usually includes fruit, bread, boiled eggs, pot noodles, beer and soft drinks. Be wary of cold meats and salads and always make sure you know how long each stop is (some are no more than five minutes) before venturing far from the coach â people have been left behind.\n\nPAYMENT:\n\nPlease note that all payments are done in CASH only - in rubles in Russia, in tugriks in Mongolia and in RMBs in China.\n\nStops at stations allow food to be bought from platform vendors or shops; fare depends on location and season, but usually includes fruit, bread, boiled eggs, pot noodles, beer and soft drinks. Be wary of cold meats and salads and always make sure you know how long each stop is (some are no more than than five minutes) before venturing far from the coach â people have been left behind."
