        "text": "The Lesser Whitethroat Sylvia curruca complex continues to provide challenges for ornithologists and taxonomists. One of the remaining outstanding questions concerns the taxonomic identity of the diferent breeding populations in Iran and in particular zagrossiensis, which inhabits the Zagros mountains. We here used the three mitochondrial genes cyt b, COI and ND2, to evaluate samples of the Lesser Whitethroat complex from Iran. Our data include predominantly samples from the breeding season, and we fnd evidence of three taxa from Iran, of which two are certainly breeding; althaea from Kopet Dagh in NE Iran and the Kerman mountains, east of the Zagros mountains, SE Iran; and curruca from central Zagros mountains and northwestern Iran. Three samples of halimodendri from the south of Iran were migrating or wintering birds. The taxonomically contentious population from the Zagros mountains is here identifed as belonging to the curruca clade, and evidence to recognize zagrossiensis based on molecular data is deemed insufcient.\n\nA massive invasion of Eurasian Bullfinches Pyrrhula pyrrhula giving a trumpet call occurred in the autumn/winter 2004/2005. Repeated invasions were also recorded the following winters in lower numbers. It is likely that the birds originate from European Russia and belong to the nominate subspecies Pyrrhula p. pyrrhula. In Switzerland, «trumpeting» Bullfinches were heard between the end of October until April, with one late record in May. They were mostly observed north of the Alps with very few sightings in the Alps or south of the Alps. The distribution of Bullfinches giving a normal call was recorded during the winter 2008/2009 and was found to be similar to the distribution of «trumpeting» Bullfinches.\n\nThe Lesser Whitethroat Sylvia curruca complex continues to provide challenges for ornithologists and taxonomists.
