        "text": "To evaluate how mortality and protective measures against exposure to cold change as temperatures fall between October and March in a region of Russia with a mean winter temperature below -6 degrees C. Interview to assess factors associated with cold stress both indoors and outdoors, to measure temperatures in living room, and to survey unheated rooms. Sverdlovsk Oblast (district), Yekaterinburg, Russia. Residents aged 50-59 and 65-74 living within approximately 140 km of Yekaterinburg in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Survey of sample of 1000 residents equally distributed by sex and age groups. Regression analysis was used to relate data on indoor heating and temperatures, the amount of clothing worn, the amount of physical activity, and shivering while outside, to outdoor temperature; results were compared with mortality patterns for ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mortality from all causes. As mean daily temperatures fell to 0 degree C the amount of clothing worn outdoors increased, physical activity while outdoors became more continuous, and only 11 (6.6%) of the 167 people surveyed who went outdoors at temperatures above 0 degree C reported shivering. The mean temperature in living rooms in the evening remained above 21.9 degrees C. Mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and all causes did not change. As the temperature fell below 0 degree C the number of items of clothing worn plateaued at 16.0 and the number of layers at 3.7. With regression analysis, shivering outdoors was found to increase progressively to 34.6% (P < 0.001) of excursions at -25 degrees C, and mortality (after declining slightly) rose progressively (all cause mortality rose by 1.15% for each 1 degree C drop in temperature from 0 degree C to -29.6 degrees C, 95% confidence interval 0.97% to 1.32%). 94.2% of bedrooms were directly heated, and evening temperatures in the living room averaged 19.8 degrees C even when outside temperatures reached -25 degrees C. Outdoor cold stress and mortality in Yekaterinburg increased only when the mean daily temperature dropped below 0 degree C. At temperatures down to 0 degree C cold stress and excess mortality were prevented by increasing the number of items of clothing worn and the amount of physical activity outdoors in combination with maintaining warmth in houses.\n\nGavin Donaldson\n\n·\n\nS P Ermakov\n\n·\n\nY M Komarov\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nW R Keatinge\n\nTo assess how effectively measures adopted in extreme cold in Yakutsk control winter mortality. Interviews to assess outdoor clothing and measure indoor temperatures; regressions of these and of delayed cause-specific mortalities on temperature. Setting Yakutsk, east Siberia, Russia. All people aged 50-59 and 65-74 years living within 400 km of Yakutsk during 1989-95 and sample of 1002 men and women who agreed to be interviewed. Daily mortality from all causes and from ischaemic heart, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease. Mean temperature for October-March 1989-95 was -26.6 degreesC. At 10.2 degrees C people wore 3.30 (95% confidence interval 3.08 to 3.53) layers of clothing outdoors, increasing to 4.39 (4.13 to 4.66; P<0. 0001) layers at -20 degrees C. Thick coats, often of fur, replaced anoraks as temperature fell to -48.2 degrees C. 82% of people went out each day when temperatures were 10.2 degrees C to -20 degrees C, but below -20 degrees C the proportion fell steadily to 44% (35% to 53%) at -48.2 degrees C (P<0.001), and overall shivering outdoors did not increase. Living room temperature was 17.9 (17.2 to 18.5) degrees C at 10.2 degrees C outdoors, 19.6 (18.8 to 20.4) degrees C at -20 degrees C, and 19.1 (18.6 to 19.6) degrees C at -48.2 degrees C. Mortality from all causes and from ischaemic heart and respiratory disease was unaffected by the fall in temperature. Mortality from respiratory disease (daily deaths per million) rose from 4.7 (4.3 to 5.1) to 5.1 (4.4 to 5.7) (P=0.03), but this was offset by a fall in deaths from injury. People in Yakutsk wore very warm clothing, and in extremely cold weather stayed indoors in warm housing, preventing the increases in mortality seen in winter in milder regions of the world. Only respiratory mortality rose, perhaps because of breathing cold air.\n\nView\n\nWilliam R Keatinge\n\n·\n\nGavin Donaldson\n\nEditor—The paper by Wilkinson et al, on people aged over 75, makes a useful addition to the evidence that winter mortality in Britain is now not caused primarily by deprivation and failure to heat homes.1 In addition to other evidence they quote, a recent study on younger people provides positive indications that cold exposure outside the home causes winter mortality regardless of economic status.2 Manual workers (social class 5) of working age (50-59) in Britain had low cold related mortality compared with any other class. This was not the case with their wives of similar age or for men of the same class after retirement age (65-74). It implies that internal heat production from manual work protected class 5 men of working age against daytime cold stress and consequent mortality. Elderly people in sheltered housing that was fully heated, but who often went outdoors, had as much winter mortality as the general elderly population.3 Despite considerable evidence, reduction of outdoor cold stress has been largely ignored in official campaigns to control winter mortality. Heating of waiting areas for public transport, and at least windproof shelters on bus routes subject to unscheduled delays, are obvious measures that would help. Another is to broadcast warnings when cold weather is forecast, that dressing warmly, with hats and with wind-proofs and waterproofs when necessary, can prevent not only discomfort but often illness and death. To keep moving while outdoors is also important. Surveys in Europe and Siberia provided statistical evidence that such behaviour, as well as warm homes, is associated with low winter mortality.4,5 We have found advice on these lines to avoid outdoor cold stress, given via the media, well received by elderly people, provided that they are also given the evidence that outdoor cold accounts for much of Britain's winter mortality.\n\nView\n\nThe Eurowinter Group\n\n·\n\nKeatinge WR\n\n·\n\nGavin Donaldson\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nIlkka Vuori\n\nBACKGROUND: Differences in baseline mortality, age structure, and influenza epidemics confound comparisons of cold-related increases in mortality between regions with different climates. The Eurowinter study aimed to assess whether increases in mortality per 1 degree C fall in temperature differ in various European regions and to relate any differences to usual winter climate and measures to protect against cold. METHODS: Percentage increases in deaths per day per 1 degree C fall in temperature below 18 degrees C (indices of cold-related mortality) were estimated by generalised linear modelling. We assessed protective factors by surveys and adjusted by regression to 7 degrees C outdoor temperature. Cause-specific data gathered from 1988 to 1992 were analysed by multiple regression for men and women aged 50-59 and 65-74 in north Finland, south Finland, Baden-Wurttemburg, the Netherlands, London, and north Italy (24 groups). We used a similar method to analyse 1992 data in Athens and Palermo. FINDINGS: The percentage increases in all-cause mortality per 1 degree C fall in temperature below 18 degrees C were greater in warmer regions than in colder regions (eg, Athens 2.15% [95% CI 1.20-3.10] vs south Finland 0.27% [0.15-0.40]). At an outdoor temperature of 7 degrees C, the mean living-room temperature was 19.2 degrees C in Athens and 21.7 degrees C in south Finland; 13% and 72% of people in these regions, respectively, wore hats when outdoors at 7 degrees C. Multiple regression analyses (with allowance for sex and age, in the six regions with full data) showed that high indices of cold-related mortality were associated with high mean winter temperatures, low living-room temperatures, limited bedroom heating, low proportions of people wearing hats, gloves, and anoraks, and inactivity and shivering when outdoors at 7 degrees C (p < 0.01 for all-cause mortality and respiratory mortality; p > 0.05 for mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease). INTERPRETATION: Mortality increased to a greater extent with given fall of temperature in regions with warm winters, in populations with cooler homes, and among people who wore fewer clothes and were less active outdoors.\n\nView"
