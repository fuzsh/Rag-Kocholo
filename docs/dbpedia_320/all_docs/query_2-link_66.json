The capital of Russia, as well as its cultural, political, scientific, and economic center, Moscow’s history extends back to medieval times. Moscow was a minor border town in its earliest history but was elevated in the 12th Century to the Grand Duchy of Moscow under the rulership of Prince Daniel. This Grand Duchy would continue to gain in power and influence after this, ultimately absorbing neighboring principalities over the following centuries, such as the Grand Duchy of Tver and the Novgorod Republic. Ultimately Ivan III extended the city’s territory to encompass all of the Rus’ territory, taking for himself the title of Tsar (though officially his son, known as Ivan the Terrible, was the first actual Tsar of Russia). Moscow has seen numerous wars through its history, from the Mongols to the Nazis, and has been under siege numerous times. Today a flourishing city, Moscow has an impressive metro system to facilitate visitors touring the city.\n\nMoscow has numerous points of cultural and historical interest, notably Red Square and the Kremlin, but also St Basil’s Cathedral, over a hundred parks and gardens, the Bolshoi Theatre, Tretyakov Gallery, and the Moscow State Circus. Key architectural points include the Ostankino Tower and the Seven Sisters, a group of skyscrapers during the Stalinist period.\n\nYekaterinburg\n\nTsar Peter the Great founded this city on the dividing line between Asian and European Russia in 1723 to facilitate the exploitation of Siberia’s vast natural resources. Named for his wife, the Empress Catherine I, Yekaterinburg is now the 2nd largest city in Siberia and is still prosperous thanks to Siberia’s mineral riches. In the wake of the Russian Revolution, Tsar Nicholas II and the rest of the Romanov family were exiled here and held at Ipatiev House (where the Church on Blood now stands) before their execution.\n\nGanina Yama Monastery\n\nOriginally the site of the Four Brothers mine, the remains of the Imperial family were thrown into a pit and burned here in 1918 before being secretly moved and buried a few miles away. Throughout Soviet rule, people still clandestinely came to pay their respects to Tsar’s family and in 1991 a memorial cross was set on this spot. The monastery was constructed in 2000, and now includes seven churches.\n\nChurch of All Saints\n\nThis church, known also as the Church on Blood in Honor of All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land, was built on the former site of Ipatiev House, where the Romanovs were held after being exiled to Yekaterinburg after the Russian Revolution, and where they were later executed. A memorial at the church includes sculptures representing the family’s final walk to execution and a memorial alter on the murder site itself, as well as an exhibit dedicated to the final days of the Imperial family.\n\nKrasnoyarsk\n\nKrasnoyarsk was one of the first Russian settlements in Siberia. Originally the border fort of Krasny Yar, it was founded on the banks of the Yenisey River in 1628 as a guard against the native people who lived in the area. The fort grew into a town after the completion of the Siberian Road (the modern-day M53) spurred trade with cities in western Russia in the early 18th Century. Near the end of the 19th Century, growth exploded again due to the arrival of the railroad and the discovery of gold in the region. The city became an industrial and manufacturing center, which it remains to this day, and is one of the country’s leading producers of aluminum. Krasnoyarsk was one of the cities to which political exiles were sent, including a number of the Decembrists who were sent from St Petersburg in the wake of the failed revolt against the Tsar. The city has a number of historic sites and is famed for the natural beauty of the surrounding area.\n\nStolby Mountains (optional)\n\nThe Stolby Nature Reserve is located about 10 km south of Krasnoyarsk, famous for its complex rock structures. Only three districts, encompassing approximately 3.5% of the reserves land area, are currently open to visitors: the Central Pillars, an area of about 50 square kilometers with a number of unique stones with names like “Stovepipe”, “Lions Gate”, and “Grandfather”; Takmakovsky, in the valley of the Bazaikha River; and the Wild Pillars, with impressive rock structures such as Manskaya Stenka and Manskaya Baba.\n\nIrkutsk\n\nIrkutsk began as a 17th Century gold-trading settlement which also served to collect the fur tax from the local Buryats. When the first road was constructed to Moscow in 1760, trade brought a number of luxuries and other items to the town for the first time. About 60 years later, the town was the seat of the Governor-General of East Siberia, and it later received an influx of exiled elites from St. Petersburg involved in the Decembrist revolt. As a consequence, the city developed a surprisingly rich cultural and intellectual life which continues to this day, with a large number of museums and scientific institutes.\n\nTaltsy Ethnographic Museum\n\nAlso called Taltsy Village, this unique open-air museum covers 67 hectares near Listvyanka and showcases over 40 preserved buildings including a watermill, a 17th Century watchtower, two churches, and various farms and peasant homes. The museum also includes 8000 exhibits relating to daily life in Siberia in the 17th to 19th Centuries. Regular folk festivals are also hosted here.\n\nMuseum of the Decembrists\n\nLocated in the Volkonsky Mansion, the former home of one of the aristocratic families exiled to Irkutsk in the wake of the failed Decembrist revolt, this museum showcases the lives of the Trubetskoy and Volkonsky families and the events of their exile. Of special note is a monument to the wives of the Decembrists who left behind everything to follow their husbands into exile.\n\nCathedral of the Holy Sign\n\nKnown also as Znamensky Monastery, this holy site has a towering iconostasis, a sarcophagus containing holy relics, and a beautifully ornate interior. The graveyard holds the grave of Grigory Shelekhov, who claimed Alaska for Russia, as well as a number of Decembrists.\n\nListvyanka\n\nListvyanka is a small town of wooden, Siberian-style houses on the shore of Lake Baikal. Some 70 km from Irkutsk, it has a population of fewer than 2000 people. Among its places of interest are the Taltsy Village, an open-air museum of various preserved examples of wooden buildings, and the Baikal Limnology Museum, showcasing the ecology and history of the lake. This town is also home to a handful of sacred sites, including the Church of St Nicholas, Shaman Rock, and the Obo (sacred for the Buryat people who live in the region). The town features a number of shops selling local crafts and souvenirs to visitors.\n\nUlaanbaatar\n\nMongolia’s capital city of Ulaanbaatar holds half the population of the country, over a million people, and accounts for two-thirds of the nation’s GDP. While there was a nomadic Buddhist center on this site at the joining of the Tuul and Selbe Rivers from as early as the 17th Century, it changed location frequently. A permanent settlement didn’t exist until 1778. Sitting on a windswept plateau, the city is noted for its severe winters and for being the coldest capital city in the world.\n\nSukhbaatar Square\n\nRenamed briefly to Chinggis Square in honor of Genghis Khan in 2013, Sukhbaatar Square is the central square of Ulaanbaatar. Named for national hero Damdin Sükhbaatar, the square once held his tomb and now features an equestrian statue of him.\n\nGandan Monastery\n\nThe Gandantegchinlen Monastery, known more commonly simply as Gandan Monastery, was one of only a few such monasteries to escape destruction in the 1930’s, when the Stalin-esque leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan led purges which killed some 35000 Mongolians, including 15000 lamas. Closed during this period, it reopened in 1944, and is today the largest Buddhist monastery in the city with some 150 monks residing there. The monastery features the largest indoor statue in the world, a 26 meter statue of Avalokitesvara.\n\nNatural History Museum\n\nEstablished in 1924 as the National Museum, the Natural History Museum has over 6000 specimens in its collection, including a nearly complete Tarbosaurus skeleton and a set of Protoceratops eggs. Museum sections include geography, biography, paleontology, and anthropology, and the displays showcase a number of species found in Mongolia including the snow leopard and red wolf.\n\nBeijing\n\nBeijing is the most populous capital city in the world, with over 21 million people. One of the oldest cities in the world, Beijing is over three thousand years old and has an impressive array of cultural and religious sites, including seven UNESCO World Heritage sites (the Great Wall, Grand Canal, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and the Forbidden City). The city has been the nation’s political center for over eight centuries, as well as its cultural and educational hub, and is one of the world’s major economic centers.\n\nThe Ming Tombs\n\nThe Thirteen Tombs of the Ming Dynasty, also called simply the Ming Tombs, are a group of Imperial tombs dating from the 15th through the 17th Centuries. They are located over a 25 square mile area in Beijing’s Changping District, just under 30 miles north of city center. Currently, three of the tombs are open to the public – Dingling (the only one to have been excavated), Changling and Zhaoling.\n\nThe Great Wall\n\nWalls along the northern border of China began to be built as early as the 7th Century BC, protecting the borders of various ancient Chinese states. However, when a unified China was built by the ascension the first Qin emperor (Qin Shi Huang) in 221 BC, the wall sections which divided the formerly separate states were ordered destroyed. The remaining wall sections (those actually on the northern border) were to be joined into a single, long wall. Few of these walls, made mostly from rammed earth, remain. Later dynasties would rebuild or expand sections of the wall, but it was the Ming dynasty that created the most famous sections of the Great Wall known today.\n\nThe Forbidden City\n\nThis 15th Century palace served as the imperial residence of 24 emperors and was the seat of government for over 500 years, beginning in 1420 (during the reign of the third Ming emperor) until the end of the Quing dynasty in 1924. Now a World Heritage site, the palace consists of some 980 buildings and covers approximately 178 acres and sees some 14 million visitors each year."
