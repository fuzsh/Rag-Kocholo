        "text": "Sunrise and sunset in Russia\n\n(Times for Moscow)\n\nThe times for sunrise and sunset in Russia are significantly influenced by the high location in the northern hemisphere. Relatively high in the north, the days are long in summer (June to September) and short in winter (December to March). With up to about 17:40 hours, there are the longest days in June. The longest dark nights, on the other hand, are in winter. A December night in Moscow lasts almost 17 hours and the days start about 5 hours later\n\nWho wants to look at the sunrise during these days, has to wake up early. Sunrise in Moscow starts already at 4:54 in the morning. The sunset on the other hand is currently late at 20:14 in the evening.\n\nBack to overview: Russia"
