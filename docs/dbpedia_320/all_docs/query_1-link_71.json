        "text": "Artur Subkhankulov returns to his home turf, a scenario that always carries significant pressure. Despite his impressive unbeaten record of 6-0, stepping into the ring before a home crowd adds a new dimension to his challenge. On 8 August, he will headline the IBA Night of Champions in Ufa, marking a highly anticipated event in the series.\n\nThe fighter is feeling the pressure of headlining the IBA event on 8 August in front of his home crowd. With an unbeaten 6-0 record, he will face Hungary's Roland Galos with an identical professional record and it will be the Russian fighter's first IBA title defence.\n\nSubkhankulov arrives after three months of training following his fight with James Chereji of Romania in the main event to become the IBA European Pro Champion. The match-up this time will be against a fighter like himself, Hungarian Roland Galos, also with a 6-0 professional record, who is defending his IBA title for the first time.\n\nIt has been only a month since Subkhankulov forced a referee stoppage in Serpukhov in the third round against Tanzania's Abeid Zugo.\n\nGalos, who represented his country at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, will face the local favourite over eight rounds on a seven-deep fight card.\n\nSubkhankulov is the favourite and is confident.\n\n\"I am very happy to be back in action at the IBA Night of Champions series tournament and, above all, to have the opportunity to defend the belt in Ufa,\" said Subkhankulov. The Russian boxer also had words of praise for his opponent. \"Galos is a high-level boxer, he has an amateur background and has yet to lose in the professional ranks. I think we will have a competitive fight, I hope to please the public of my city\", he added.\n\nIt is clear that a month has passed since the July 12 fight against Zugo Aenas, but the Russian feels confident and points out that the fight was not too long and that has allowed him to recover quickly. \"That bout in Serpukhov was over quickly, I wasn't even particularly tired, and I didn't lose my shape, after that fight, I rested for a week, and then I started preparing to defend my title,\" he said.\n\n\"He is 32 years old and experienced enough to face a fighter who is unbeaten in the pros and who will make things difficult for him. I plan to work with my own style, I'm not going to make anything up,\" Subkhankulov added.\n\nThe Ufa Arena will host Artur Subkhankulov’s highly anticipated headline bout at the IBA Night of Champions. Alongside Subkhankulov’s main event, the evening will feature an eight-round 75kg clash between Russia's Dzhambulat Bizhamov and Colombia's Juan Narvaez, as well as another eight-round 75kg bout between Kazakhstan's Saparbay Aidarov and Uzbekistan's Alokhon Abdullaev. Additionally, Russia’s Danis Gabdrafikov will face Mongolia’s Misheelt Battumur in a six-round 67kg fight.\n\nThe event will also showcase Russia's Azaliya Amineva against Tanzania's Rehema Abdallah in a six-round 66kg match, and a 10-round 69.9kg bout featuring Russia's Vadim Musaev and Namibia's Paulus Amavila. The night will kick off with a six-round 63.5kg fight between Egor Kozorezov of Russia and India's Chahal Akshay."
