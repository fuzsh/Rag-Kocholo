        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new law into effect that calls for sentences of up to 15 years in prison for people who distribute \"false news\" about the Russian military.\n\nThe Kremlin said it needed a \"harsh\" new law to tackle such reports due to the current \"information war.\"\n\nThe law and other aspects of the current Russian clampdown on independent domestic and international media outlets covering Moscow's ongoing unprovoked invasion of Ukraine have already prompted Russian and international closures and suspensions.\n\nMajor international broadcasters who have announced suspensions include BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, CBS, and German ARD and ZDF to suspend reporting from inside Russia.\n\nMultiple websites of RFE/RL, BBC, and other outlets have also been blocked over what Russian regulators say is erroneous reports.\n\nBlocks by the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor have included social media including, most recently, Facebook.\n\nRoskomnadzor has ordered media across the country to only publish information provided by official sources. It also forbids describing the unprovoked actions as an invasion or a war, instead insisting they are called \"special military operations.\"\n\nRussian lawmakers approved the draft law to criminalize spreading \"false news\" about the army on March 4.\n\nThe legislation will be added as a separate article to the Criminal Code to \"prevent the discrediting of the armed forces of the Russian Federation during their operations to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, maintaining international peace and security.\"\n\nIt envisages penalties of up to 10 years in prison for individuals convicted of the offense. The penalty for the distribution of fake news about the Russian military that leads to \"serious consequences\" rises to up to 15 years in prison.\n\nIt also makes it illegal \"to make calls against the use of Russian troops to protect the interests of Russia\" or \"for discrediting such use\" with a penalty possible of up to three years in prison. The same provision applies to calls for sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe move comes as the Russian authorities ratchet up pressure on media outlets, threatening them for their reporting about the invasion on topics such as the heavy resistance being put up by Ukrainian forces despite Russia's overwhelming military power.\n\nOn March 3, one of the most popular media outlets in the country, the Moscow-based Ekho Moskvy radio station, said it would be closing, at least temporarily, after being taken off air this week over its coverage of the invasion.\n\nAnother independent outlet, Dozhd TV, also announced its suspension of broadcasts.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe Taliban has created \"the world's most serious women's rights crisis\" since returning to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says.\n\nUnder the Taliban rule, Afghanistan has become the only country where girls are banned from going to school beyond the sixth grade, HRW said in a press release on August 11.\n\nThe Taliban has also \"undermined women's right to freedom of movement, banned them from many forms of employment, dismantled protections for women and girls experiencing gender-based violence, created barriers to them accessing health care, and barred them from playing sports, and even visiting parks.\"\n\nThe pressures on Afghan women come as their country is also experiencing a major humanitarian crisis, with aid severely underfunded and thousands of Afghan refugees forced back into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, HRW said.\n\nThe situation has been described by the United Nations special rapporteur on Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, as \"an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls,\" HRW said.\n\n\"Under the Taliban's abusive rule, Afghan women and girls are living their worst nightmares,\" HRW's Fereshta Abbasi said.\n\nAbbasi urged all governments to \"support efforts to hold the Taliban leadership and all those responsible for serious crimes in Afghanistan to account.\"\n\nAbbasi said countries engaging with the Taliban-led government in Kabul should consistently remind it that its \"abuses against women and girls and all Afghans violate Afghanistan's obligations under international law.\"\n\nMore than half of Afghanistan's population -- 23 million people -- face food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nRestrictions that the Taliban authorities have imposed on women and girls have impeded access to health care, jeopardizing their right to health, HRW noted.\n\nThe Taliban's bans on girls' education inevitably leads to future shortages of female health workers, HRW said.\n\nThe rights group called on donor countries to find ways to mitigate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan without reinforcing the Taliban's repressive policies against women and girls.\n\nMoscow ordered more evacuations on August 12 in two regions bordering Ukraine, regional officials reported, as its forces rushed to contain a shock incursion by the Ukrainian military into its territory.\n\nThe evacuation of civilians from the Kursk region was widened to include the Belovsky district, which has a population of some 14,000 people, the district chief, Nikolai Volobuyev, said on Telegram.\n\n\"The situation is very tense. Anyone who can should independently come to the collection point in the village of Dolgie Budy or in the settlement of Bushmeno in the Oboyansky district. Buses will be provided. Anyone who is still in the area is kindly requested to leave the area,\" Volobuyev wrote.\n\nIn a post on Telegram on August 11, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have contained the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk.\n\nEarlier on August 12, the governor of the western Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram that the authorities were relocating residents of the Krasnoyaruzh district to \"safer places\" due to \"activity\" in the area by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe evacuations come as Ukrainian troops have advanced some 30 kilometers inside Russia in what has become the most significant incursion since the war began in February 2022.\n\nRussia's military also said on August 12 that its air defenses had intercepted 11 drones that Ukraine launched overnight targeting the western Kursk region.\n\nAir defenses also destroyed five Ukrainian-launched drones over the Belgorod region and two over the Voronezh region, the ministry said on August 12. The ministry did not say how many drones in total Ukraine launched.\n\nUkrainian forces entered the Kursk region on August 6, the largest cross-border operation by Kyiv since Moscow launched its full-scale offensive more than two years ago.\n\nUkraine's military claims it has captured a number of settlements in the Kursk region, as clips emerged purportedly showing troops seizing administrative buildings in Sverdlikovo and Poroz, while intense fighting has been reported in Sudzha, a town of about 5,000 people.\n\nIn the village of Guevo, Ukrainian soldiers filmed themselves removing the Russian flag from an administrative building.\n\nMoscow has rushed in reserve troops, aviation, tanks, artillery, and drones in a bid to repel the incursion, which caught the Russian authorities off-guard.\n\nDespite these efforts, however, Russia acknowledged on August 11 that Ukraine had been able to penetrate into its territory by up to 30 kilometers in some areas.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

They don't care who's killed or what attacks occur. If they're genuinely ensuring security, why do explosions keep happening?\"\n\nShi'ite Muslims, the country's largest religious minority, have complained that the Sunni Taliban has not done enough to protect them from terror attacks and have accused the Taliban itself of abuses, including \"killing, torture, and forced displacement.\" Most Shi'a in Afghanistan are members of the historically persecuted Hazara ethnic minority.\n\nA report this year by the U.S. State Department cited several examples of terror attacks against the Hazara community and stated that religious freedoms have continued to deteriorate under harsh Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Consistent with trends observed in past years, many suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians targeted Shi’a Muslims, particularly ethnic Hazara,\" by the IS-K terrorist group, it said.\n\nThe report identified IS-K as the \"most serious threat\" in the Central and South Asia region and said the group was \"projecting terror beyond Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe U.S. report also cited UN officials in Afghanistan as saying the Taliban \"had marginalized the minority Shi'a Muslim population in an effort to force them to leave the country.\"\n\nBulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev has urged Western news organizations to withdraw any correspondents working in Russia, saying the value of having reporters there is outweighed by the risk of having them seized and used by the Kremlin as assets in future prisoner swaps.\n\n\"This is a period of time when information from Russia cannot be reported honestly,\" Grozev* told Bulgarian public broadcaster BNT in an interview released on August 10.\n\n\"Therefore, the added value of having your representative there is very small compared to the risk of our [journalistic] colleagues being arrested and simply becoming an asset in a [prisoner] swap fund for the future.\"\n\nThe remarks come after a major exchange of detained and imprisoned persons was conducted on August 1 between the United States, Germany, and other Western states on one side and Russia and Belarus on the other.\n\nBNT, CNN, and others have reported that Grozev took part in preliminary negotiations on the prisoner exchange, actions he has indirectly confirmed in a series of interviews.\n\nRussia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its Federal Security Service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included journalists Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal and Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL, both U.S. citizens.\n\nThe 32-year-old Gershkovich was detained in Russia in March 2023 while on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg. He was sentenced in July to 16 years in prison on spying charges that were rejected by the United States and his WSJ employer.\n\nKurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military -- charges she and RFE/RL denied -- and sentenced to 6 1/2 years.\n\n\"The arrest of foreigners in Russia is planned,\" Grozev said.\n\n\"It is planned with the aim to fill a [prisoner] swap fund. Our colleagues from The Wall Street Journal published an extensive investigation practically proving the arrest of Evan had been set up as a planned operation -- not the result of some alleged counterintelligence about him collecting secret information.\"\n\n“They were planning to arrest someone with his status because they knew\" it would become a major issue in the United States.\n\nGrozev said the list of people considered for the prisoner swap changed over the years of negotiations.\n\n“The original list was put together in early 2022. Of course, among the Russian opposition figures who needed to be released, the central figure was Aleksei Navalny.\"\n\n“On the other side, the central figure was Putin's personal assassin, Vadim Krasikov. Four more people were added on both sides. The original list was five-on-five [prisoners to be exchanged],\" he said.\n\nOver the course of 2023, \"both sides expanded [the list] to eight-on-eight. A large part of those eight by the Russian side were the same people who were eventually released -- of course, with the exception of Aleksei Navalny,\" who died in a remote Russian prison before the swap was finalized.\n\nGrozev said Berlin held the most important \"bargaining chip\" for the Kremlin -- Krasikov, who had been sentenced to life in prison for murder.\n\nThe Germans were so angry about Navalny's death that they \"bet it all on one card in the negotiations with Russia,\" Grozev explained.\n\n\"The Germans said: We are giving up the idea [of a prisoner swap] of one-on-one -- a symmetric swap. From now on, for our release of Vadim Krasikov, we want you to release practically all the big names held in Russian prisons -- the Russian opposition figures who have spoken up against the war [in Ukraine].\"\n\n\"That is how the list changed -- six or seven names from the Russian opposition were added. I didn't take part in this last stage [of negotiations], but I know how it developed. The German government was really angry and was ready to drop any deal with Russia. But in the end, they managed to free more people than was actually considered possible at the beginning.\"\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Christo Grozev's professional affiliation.\n\nBELGRADE -- Serbian police have removed protesters opposed to lithium mining from two railway stations in the capital, Belgrade, where they were blocking train traffic.\n\nRiot police used shields to disperse the protesters at the Prokop and Novi Beograd railway stations at around 5.30 a.m. on August 11, participants told RFE/RL.\n\nThe Internal Affairs Ministry said the railway traffic disrupted by the protests had been restored. The ministry warned that criminal charges will be brought against those who caused the traffic disruption and endangered public safety.\n\nOn August 10, tens of thousands of protesters rallied in the Belgrade city center and then split into two groups that separated and headed to the railway stations. Some of the protesters forced the trains to stop by lying or sitting on the tracks.\n\nThe protesters demanded a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nProtesters who had spent the night of August 10-11 at the train stations also demanded that authorities release three demonstrators who had been detained by police.\n\nZlatko Kokanovic, one of the organizers of the protests, told RFE/RL the three activists were detained at the Prokop station.\n\n\"Ivan Bjelic, Nikola Ristic, and Jevdenije Dimitrijevic were arrested. They are accused of disobedience and reckless behavior,\" Kokanovic said.\n\nKokanovic on August 10 had vowed more rallies would take place in other cities across Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Ivica Dacic insisted police had intervened without the use of coercive measures and no one was injured.\n\n\"A total of 14 persons have been brought on suspicion of having committed criminal offenses, three on misdemeanor [charges], and two foreign citizens because of their presence at the protest near important state institutions,\" Dacic said.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said the protests were \"a mockery of democracy\" and added that stopping traffic at railway stations and roads was \"the implementation of violence, will, and terror of the minority against the majority.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Serbian government had rejected the project in the wake of massive public protests amid concerns over its impact on the environment.\n\nBut it reinstated the plan on July 16 this year, days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nThree days after the court ruling, a Critical Raw Materials Summit was held in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the mining of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile devices, is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nKYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned Moscow's latest deadly attack on civilian areas of Kyiv and urged his Western allies to lift restrictions on the use of weapons deep inside of Russia, even as he for the first time indirectly acknowledged his forces' cross-border offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.\n\n\"The Russians have no geographical restrictions on the use of such weapons -- since the first days of the full-scale war, the entire territory of our state has been under constant threat of attack,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X on August 11.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Three others, including a 13-year-old child, were seriously wounded in the attack, it added.\n\nFragments of a missile fell on residential buildings in the Brovary district, neighboring the capital. Kyiv's military administration said the city's air-defense systems had been activated.\n\nFive other regions were being attacked by Russian drones, according to Ukraine's air force.\n\nCities across Ukraine have been regularly hit by Russian air strikes from missiles and drones. There has been growing concern among many Ukrainians in recent days that Moscow might intensify its air raids in response to Kyiv's recent incursion into Russian territory.\n\nIn Russia, Kursk regional Governor Aleksei Smirnov said 13 people had been injured by debris from a downed Ukrainian missile that fell on a residential building during the night. Two of the injured were in serious condition, Smirnov said on August 11.\n\nResidents of the nine-story building were to be evacuated to temporary accommodations, according to Igor Kutsak, mayor of the regional capital, Kursk city.\n\nThe whole city was under an air-raid alert, the official said on Telegram. He posted a photo that showed an apartment building with blown out windows and damaged balconies.\n\nIn the neighboring Voronezh region, Russian authorities claimed that debris from a downed Ukraine-launched drone damaged an administrative building and a utility facility in the provincial capital of the same name. There were no injuries, they added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said on August 11 that its air-defense units destroyed 16 Ukrainian-lunched drones over the Voronezh region, while 14 drones and four Tochka-U tactical ballistic missiles were downed over the Kursk region.\n\nThree drones were downed over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, and one drone each was destroyed over the Bryansk and Orlov regions, the ministry said on Telegram.\n\nThe claims cannot be independently verified.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and AP\n\nTens of thousands of protesters opposed to lithium mining in Serbia packed the streets of Belgrade on August 10 and marched to two railway stations where some of them blocked train traffic.\n\nThe protest started at the center of the Serbian capital and then split into two groups that separated and headed to Prokop station and Novi Beograd station. Some of the protesters forced the trains to stop by lying or sitting on the tracks.\n\nThe protesters demanded a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water. They carried the banners saying \"No to the mine, exploitation, eviction\" and \"Rio Tinto march from Serbia\" and chanted, \"You will not dig\" and \"Treason, betrayal!\"\n\n\"There is no turning back, we are defending Serbia,\" said Zlatko Kokanovic, an environmental activist who called on the protesters to continue their action peacefully.\n\nThe protest took place at the invitation of the Alliance of Environmental Organizations of Serbia after the government failed to meet a deadline that opponents to mining set to ban the mining of lithium and the opening of mine in Jadar in the west of the country.\n\n\"It seems that we have been victimized as a future mining colony and landfill. We will not allow that. That is why we are here today to raise our voices, to disagree and to defend survival in our country,\" actress and environmental activist Svetlana Bojkovic told the gathering.\n\nThe Serbian government on July 16 reinstated a plan for a lithium mine in the Jadar region operated by Rio Tinto.\n\nThe Serbian government rejected the project in 2022 after massive environmental protests, but reinstated the plan days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nThree days after the decision a Critical Raw Materials Summit was held in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the mining of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile devices, is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nBelarusian journalist and political activist Andrey Hnyot, who is under house arrest in Belgrade awaiting a final decision on his extradition to Belarus, has been removed from the Interpol wanted list.\n\nThe international police agency's warrant for Hnyot’s arrest was issued at the request of Belarus, which accuses him of tax evasion. Hnyot has denied Minsk's accusations and called them politically motivated.\n\n\"Andrey Hnyot is no longer the subject of Interpol's notification,\" according to a decision of the General Secretariat of Interpol. The decision was forwarded to the media on August 10 by his lawyer, Vadim Drozdov.\n\nHnyot said in a statement to RFE/RL that Interpol informed representatives of the European Union in Serbia that the warrant \"was suspended and the data deleted due to the violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Interpol Statute.\"\n\nHe said that those provisions refer to politically motivated criminal prosecution.\n\n\"As far as I know, representatives of the EU brought this important information to the attention of the government of Serbia and the judiciary. However, this did not result in my release,\" said Hnyot.\n\nHnyot pointed out that the process of his extradition is ongoing and he is under house arrest until the final decision.\n\n\"That will be my only and last chance to challenge the illegality of my extradition,\" he said, adding that he has not been able to receive adequate medical care and has no source of income to pay rent or buy food and medicine.\n\nHnyot was arrested in October 2023 at the Belgrade airport after arriving from Thailand, where he was in exile.\n\nHe spent seven months in Belgrade Central Prison before being transferred to house arrest on June 5.\n\nThe High Court in Belgrade on June 13 issued a ruling on the extradition that would send him back to Belarus, but it is not yet final.\n\nDrozdov said that Interpol responded to his request to delete Hnyot from its information system with a decision made on August 5.\n\n\"This means that no country will be able to detain him at the request of Belarus,\" said Drozdov in a statement.\n\nHnyot fled Belarus for Thailand in 2020 after criticizing the regime and participating in massive protests that occurred after the presidential election in which authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka declared victory.\n\nWestern countries do not recognize the results of those elections, and after violence against demonstrators, the European Union imposed sanctions on Minsk.\n\nBrussels called for Hnyot’s release on June 13 a blistering warning for authorities in EU candidate Serbia, and several media and nongovernmental organizations did the same.\n\nHnyot 's lawyer has informed the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg about the case.\n\nAccording to his statements, the court sent a letter to the authorities in Serbia that it expects that Hnyot will not be immediately extradited after a final decision by the High Court, allowing time for him to address the European Court.\n\nHnyot currently wears an ankle-bracelet monitor and is confinement to a modest, 20-square-meter apartment in Belgrade.\n\nThe prospect of a forced return to a regime that Hnyot describes as \"torture, blood, nightmare\" is motivating.\n\nHe told RFE/RL’s Balkan Service in mid-June in his first interview after his transfer to house arrest that he works \"from morning to night\" on his defense.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has voided the inquiry that led to an Olympic bronze medal for American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the women’s floor exercise.\n\nThe ruling by the CAS on August 10 said the inquiry filed on behalf of Chiles after the final in the event on August 5 came outside the 1-minute time limit allowed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG).\n\nChiles was awarded the bronze medal after her inquiry was filed, but the CAS agreed with an appeal filed by the Romanian Gymnastics Federation on behalf of gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, who were bumped into fourth and fifth place, respectively, by the judge's decision.\n\n\"The inquiry submitted on behalf of…Chiles in the Final of the women’s Floor exercise was raised after the conclusion of the one-minute deadline…and is determined to be without effect,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt also said the initial score given to Chiles, which initially put her in fifth place, \"shall be reinstated.\"\n\nThe CAS said the final ranking was up to the FIG but said it should “assign the medal(s) in accordance with the above decision.”\n\nThe decision means Barbosu, 18, will receive her country's only medal in the gymnastics competition.\n\n\"I can barely express my emotions. I can't believe it,\" Barbosu told Romanian media. \"When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me.\"\n\nIt has been an emotional roller coaster for Barbosu, who thought she won bronze on the night of the competition and began celebrating only to leave the floor in tears with Maneca-Voinea after the revision of the scores.\n\nChiles initially was given a score of 13.666 that put her in fifth place behind Maneca-Voinea. U.S. coach Cecile Landi called for an inquiry, and after a review, judges boosted Chiles’s total by 0.1. That was enough to leapfrog Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea for bronze.\n\nThe Romanian Gymnastics Federation welcomed the decision and congratulated its two gymnasts.\n\n\"We laugh with one eye, we cry with one,\" it said on Facebook. \"Following this decision, Ana Maria Barbosu gets the bronze medal while Sabrina Maneca-Voinea ends the competition on the 4th place.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement it is “devastated” by the ruling.\n\n\"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring,\" the organization said."
