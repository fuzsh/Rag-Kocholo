Since the moment i made contact from Australia and was thinking of a new adventure in Russia the communication, the staff, the ease of use, the price all came into play. Out of that i received friendship, laughs, experiences, memories and of course A holiday I will cherish in more ways than one. If you're considering Russia. Yes. Do it. All the way, you will love it. Food, history, people, experiences (and of course a few cheeky drinks).\n\nIf you're looking for a team that will make it happen. Yes. Discovery Russia is your team, from abroad, back home and on the ground. It's my last day of a 18 day holiday to Russia. The people on tour, the team/guides. I m going to miss them all. Your inclusions will leave you exhausted, but so glad you choose it all. I know I'm coming back."
