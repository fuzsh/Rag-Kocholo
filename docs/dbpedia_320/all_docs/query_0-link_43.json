        "text": "International airport at Yekaterinbug, Russia\n\nKoltsovo International Airport (Russian: Аэропорт Кольцово) (IATA: SVX, ICAO: USSS) is the international airport serving Yekaterinburg, Russia, located 16 km (10 mi) southeast of the city. Being the largest airport in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Koltsovo also serves nearby towns such as Aramil, Sysert, and Polevskoy. In general, the airport is responsible for serving approximately 4,290,000 people yearly. The airport is a hub for Ural Airlines,[2] RusLine[3] and Aviacon Zitotrans. Due to its location in the center of Russia, Yekaterinburg's airport is included in the \"Priority Airports\" list of Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia).\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nKoltsovo was first used as a civil airport on July 10, 1943.\n\nIn 2014, Koltsovo Airport had a passenger traffic of 4,526,167, a +5.4% increase from that of 2013.[4] Domestic passenger traffic of 2014 made up for 2,407,429 (+11.3%) passengers; international passenger traffic consisted of 2,118,738 (-0.5%) passengers. In 2014 Koltsovo operated 25,531 tonnes of cargo, a -8.1% decrease from that of last year.[4] Koltsovo operated 3,600 tonnes of mail, a 250% increase from that of 2013.[4] In 2013, it handled 4,293,002 passengers and 27,800 tonnes of cargo, representing a +13.5% increase compared to the previous year.[5]\n\nKoltsova is managed by Airports of Regions Holding, who also manage Kurumoch International Airport (Samara), Strigino International Airport (Nizhny Novgorod), Platov International Airport (Rostov-On-Don) and Gagarin International Airport (Saratov), with two new airports planned: Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Novy Urengoy. It is a joint public-private enterprise with private investments exceeding 70 billion rubles.[6]\n\nKoltsovo is a member of Airports Council International (ACI) and is in the top 7 busiest airports in Russia.\n\nThe base is home to the 32nd Independent Composite Transport Aviation Regiment as part of the 14th Air and Air Defence Forces Army.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n1928–1945\n\n[edit]\n\nKoltsovo's original aerodrome was constructed between 1928 and 1930 at the behest of the Air Force Institute of the USSR.[8] It was primarily built as a military aerodrome. In 1932, the 33rd air division, formerly belonging to the Privolzhsky Military District, was transferred to the Koltsovo aerodrome;[8] the division was later redirected to the border with Finland during the Winter War. After Nazi Germany declared war on the USSR, entangling the Soviet Union into World War II, construction of a 1 km runway was announced. Construction began the next day and the runway was completed in three months, a record breaking time for the 1940s.[8]\n\nOn 15 May 1942, USSR's first jet engine plane, the BI-1, completed its maiden flight from Koltsovo airport. The new aircraft was manually operated by Grigory Bakhchivadzhi. Six experimental flights were conducted on the BI-1, until, on the 7th flight, during maximum speed testing, the pilot lost control of the trajectory of the plane and crashed, resulting in Bakhchivadzhi's death. A 1:1 scale replica of the BI-1 jet plane was recreated in the front square of the airport in honour of the BI-1 and Grigory. The monument still stands.\n\nOn 10 July 1943, the airport gained domestic status. This made Koltsovo the first airport in the USSR to have civil and military status at once.[8] Flights from Yekaterinburg to Moscow were conducted on a daily basis. In December 1943, on the way back from Tehran, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stayed overnight at the Koltsovo airport. During World War II the airport acted as a joint in the classified route between Fairbanks, Alaska and Moscow, Russia, in which C-47 aircraft were imported into the USSR. By January 1944, Koltsovo owned four aircraft, granted by the USSR Ministry of Civil Aviation for the purpose of domestic flights: two LI-2 and two Junkers. After the surrender of Nazi Germany, Koltsovo was used as joint for the relocation of military aircraft to the Pacific Front for the combating of the Japanese Empire. Between 1943 and 1945, despite the extremely high traffic rates for an airport of such size, no airplane crashes were recorded.[8]\n\n1945–1991\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1951, the airfield underwent a reconstruction. In the early 1950s, flights from Moscow to Beijing, China, made a layover in Koltsovo. The route from Koltsovo to Beijing was also the airport's first international flight. In 1954, a new terminal completed construction. The Russian Imperial-Modern style and the large spire made this terminal a prominent symbol of Yekaterinburg and all of Sverdlovsk. In 1956 all runways were extended and reinforced with concrete flooring.[8] This allowed for larger aircraft such as the Tu-104 and IL-18 to dock at Koltsovo. In 1958, a hotel with 100 rooms was built 800m from the terminal. The hotel went bankrupt in 1961 and was the demolished the preceding year.\n\nIn 1963, a new 3-star \"Liner\" hotel[9] with 235 rooms completed construction. On 1 January 1967, a new terminal complex was exploited for domestic flights. This terminal was twice as large as the original terminal and had a passenger traffic limit of 1,500,000 passengers and could support 700 pax/hour. The terminal was placed to the right of the original terminal; today, the new Terminal A and B stand where the 1967 terminal stood.\n\nIn 1983, an arrival terminal was built. On 6 March 1987, a second runway completed construction and was exploited. In 1991, due to the dissolution of the USSR, the Sverdlovsk united air group of the Ural Civil Airports Office was reformed to the First Sverdlovsk Airline.[8] In October 1993, Koltsovo was granted international status.[8] On 28 December 1993, as a result of the division and privatization of the First Sverdlovsk Air, two joint-stock companies were set up: OJSC (now JSC) \"Airport Koltsovo\" and JSC \"Ural Airlines\". Later JSC Koltsovo Airport was renamed to JSC \"Koltsovo Invest\", Koltsovo's current owner company.\n\n2003–present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2003, an implement of the airport development as a hub Program was started with the support of Russian Federation Ministry of Transport, Sverdlovsk Oblast Government and the Renova Group. Investment into the Koltsovo large scale reconstruction of 2003–2009 years estimated about 12,000,000,000 rubles: private investments totaled 8,000,000,000 rubles (to the air-terminal complex development and technical re-equipment of services), state investments totaled 4,000,000,000 rubles (to rebuild aerodrome pavement and control tower building).[8] In 2005, a new international terminal for Yekaterinburg finished construction and was exploited for proper use. The same year Yekaterinburg established new borders of the city, resulting in Koltsovo village, where the airport was located, in becoming part of Yekaterinburg's municipal district.[10] A new catering facility was also implemented in 2005, as well as the international terminal.[8]\n\nIn 2006, the original Koltsovo terminal was converted to a business terminal and underwent a complete renovation. The preceding year, the domestic terminal adjacent to the international terminal completed construction. In 2008, an aeroexpress railway station from the center of Yekaterinburg to Koltsovo finished building. On 14 June 2009, Koltsovo received its first ever jumbo jet: the Air China Boeing 747 with the Chinese delegates. On 15 June 2009, the international terminal was expanded again and opened by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev in time for the BRICS (then known as BRIC) summit.[11] Additionally in 2009, the 4-star Angelo hotel, new control tower, and a fixed runway were put into exploitation.[8] This enabled the airport to handle all types of heavy aircraft, including the Airbus A380, Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Boeing 747, and Airbus A330 aircraft.\n\nBeginning 24 May 2014, Koltsovo began cooperating with CIS Routes.

On 15 June 2009, a larger, 45,000 m2 international terminal completed construction in time for the BRICS summit, and took the role of Terminal B. The original one was merged with the domestic terminal. Terminal B has a capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal consists of 2 floors and is conjoined to Terminal A. The ground floor houses the check-in desks, a baggage claim area with the baggage carousels, customs control and several retail stores. On the second floor there stand the security control, international business lounge, a duty-free shop, a smoking room and several retail shops.[17] General renovations were made alongside the domestic renovation project. The business terminal was renovated as recent as February 2014.\n\nThe business terminal, otherwise known as the VIP terminal, offers those willing to pay a unique experience. The business terminal is accessible only through direct payment. Prices can range from 8,500 rubles (one pass) to 250,000 rubles (12-month membership).[18] The business terminal is located in Koltsovo's first terminal, built in 1954. The structure has a mix of empire style and Russian neoclassical revival styles, enhancing the royal feel. Inside, the VIP terminal is also styled in neoclassical revival. The business terminal offers separate check-in desks, passport and custom controls. Free WiFi, catering, and delivery to the airplane is also offered.[19] The total area of the VIP terminal is 9,800 m2.\n\nRunways\n\n[edit]\n\nThe airport has 2 runways.
