        "text": "1. The Last Tsar\n\nResplendent, majestic, magnificent: these are just a few of the adjectives used to describe the Church upon the Blood in Honour of All Saints (its full name). If the name gives a sense of something rather ominous, don't be alarmed. It's simply Russian history as usual. The church is built on the site where, in 1918, following a year of confinement, the Emperor Nicholas, his wife and children were executed. Of course, the former USSR was nothing if not expedient and, in 1977, the original house was demolished and up went this magnificent church. Ignore the macabre sense of irony (which is quite evident in the works of Russian authors) and enjoy the stunning interiors, which are as amazing as the outside.\n\n2. 52 Stories High\n\nWhat's the view like from the Vysotskiy Viewing Platform? Simply use the elevators to scale its 52 floors (that's 618 ft!) to get a breathtaking, panoramic view of the city of Ekaterinburg from way on up high. This is the second tallest building in Russia outside of Moscow, making the Vysotskiy skyscraper, which also houses many important and highly visible businesses, an unofficial icon of the city.\n\n3. Ural Art\n\nThe long, nondescript building with its bright green gables could be mistaken for a country club if it weren't for the massive ironworks surrounding the building. Clearly of historical significance, these draw visitors in to know more. Once within the museum, you'll get a sense of the history and culture of Ekaterinburg. Besides the carefully curated collections in the gallery, of special note is the multiple dioramas or miniatures of the buildings. These show the progression and evolution of Ekaterinburg architecture and society.\n\n4. Remembering A Historic President\n\nMuch beloved during Soviet Rule, the \"Yeltsin Center\" was opened in 2015 as an educational and political center. The center features concerts, multiple-day music festivals such as Island of the 90s\", \"Old new rock\", cultural exhibitions, comic cons, and lectures by major international figures such as Germany's Minister of the Interior. The center hosts numerous domestic and global film festivals such as Artdocfest and Beat Weekend, while also presenting numerous cultural and heritage media initiatives such as Jewish cultural programming and winter holiday celebrations throughout the year\n\n5. The Past Preserved\n\nWith its charming old lampposts, fences of cast iron, and walking paths leading to beautiful, traditional summer homes, the Literary Quarter of Ekaterinburg is the cultural center of the city. Not least because this district is where Ural writers and artists are celebrated and their writings preserved and displayed proudly. These include major contemporary figures such as Dmitry Mamina-Sibiryak and Pavel Bazhov. While these may be new names to visitors seeing Ekaterinburg for the first time, the Literary Quarter's eclectic charms are sure to feel familiar."
