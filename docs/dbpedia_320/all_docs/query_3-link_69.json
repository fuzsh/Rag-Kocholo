        "text": "Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and U.S. Marine Paul Whelan were released Thursday in a agreed to by Russia and the United States.\n\nTurkish officials confirmed the exchange took place in Ankara and involved 24 adults who had been imprisoned in seven different countries.\n\nPresident Joe Biden released a about the release of Whelan and Gershkovich alongside Alsu Kurmasheva andVladimir Kara-Murza.\n\nAll told, we've negotiated the release of 16 people from Russia - including five German and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country,\" Biden stated in the release. \"Some of these women and men have been unjustly held for years. All have endured unimaginable suffering and uncertainty. Today, their agony is over.\n\nThe president also at the White House surrounded by the families of Whelan, Gershkovich,Kurmasheva andKara-Murza.\n\nBiden said the Americans were able to speak with their family members over the phone as they traveled back home to the U.S. and added that \"the brutal ordeal is over, and they're free.\"\n\nHe went on to say the journalists released from Russia were convicted in \"show trials\" with \"absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever ever, none.\"\n\n\"All three falsely accused of being spies,\" he said.\n\nThe president added he began to work on trying to release the wrongfully detained Americans before he was officially in office.\n\nOur work did not start just on day one. I started before day one. During the transition, I instructed our National Security team to dig into all the cases of hostages being wrongfully detained,” Biden said. “As of today, my administration’s brought home over 70 Americans.\n\nIn a brief question and answer, Biden seemingly took a swipe at former President Donald Trump when asked if he had a message for Trump after he claimed he could have gotten the hostages out without giving anything in exchange.\n\n\"Why didn’t he do it when he was president?\" Biden replied.\n\nBiden ended the news conference by leading the families in a rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" toKurmasheva’s daughter who turns 13 years old on Friday.\n\n“Now she gets to celebrate with her mom. That’s what this is all about families — able to be together again like they should have been all along,” Biden said after singing with Miriam Butorin by his side.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said during the daily White House press briefing that Biden was going to reach out and thank the leaders of Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Turkey.\n\nSullivan appeared to fight back tears while addressing reporters and thanking his colleagues. He called the prisoner swap \"the culmination of a monumental level of effort and level of skill by my teammates across the national security enterprise\" and praised the president by saying the exchange was \"a feat of diplomacy that honestly could only be achieved by a leader like Joe Biden.\"\n\nHe jokingly said he was saving his tears for the podium.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken applauded the \"extraordinary efforts of countless people in the State Department\" and across the government for striking an agreement to secure the prisoners' freedom.\n\n\"My pledge to the families of those still separated from their families is the same that I made to those returning home today. We will not forget you, and we will not rest until you see your loved ones again,\" he .\n\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press reported prominent Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin and several other figures who were imprisoned for criticizing the military or for alleged extremist activity with the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny were moved to an unknown destination.\n\nThe movements prompted speculation on social media about whether they were in preparation for some kind of a prisoner swap involving Russia, the U.S. and its allies.\n\nGershkovich, 32, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years on July 19.\n\nHe was while on a reporting trip to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg and accused of spying for the U.S.\n\nThe called it \"the largest and most complex East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.\"\n\nPaul Whelan, 53, a corporate security director from Michigan, was serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted on spying charges that he and the U.S. denied.\n\nIn 2022, Whelan was left out of two prisoner swaps including and WNBA star .\n\nA Russian assassin serving a life sentence in Germany, Vadim Krasikov, 58, was reportedly exchanged for the two dozen prisoners.\n\nKrasikov was convicted for the Aug. 23, 2019, killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.\n\nAt his sentencing to life in prison in 2021, German judges said Krasikov had acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him a false identity, passport and the resources to carry out the killing.\n\nA full list of the people freed in the prisoner swap deal with Russia can be .\n\nArrests of Americans are increasingly common in Russia, with nine U.S. citizens known to be detained there as tensions between the two countries have escalated over fighting in Ukraine.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this month at the that the administration was \"determined\" to make a deal happen and considered it \"one of the most important things between now and the end of the year.\"\n\n\"We are going to make every effort we can to get to the point where Russia agrees to release Evan and Paul, that we get them home and we get them home safe,\" he said."
