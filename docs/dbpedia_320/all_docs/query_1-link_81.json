        "text": "Hello, Здравствуйте,\n\nI am a Canadian who has been in love with the Russian culture, history and language since I was 10 years old. As of April 2023 I started learning the language and have a strong urge to visit. I can hold a very basic conversation, but my reading is pretty good.\n\nI am planning on flying into DME, then proceeding to Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Golden Ring, maybe Lake Baikal and Novosibirsk.\n\nI have the flight figured out, but not booked yet. I wanted to run it by reddit first.\n\nSo I guess my questions would be,\n\nIs it really that much of a risk to visit now? (I am not worried but everyone I talk to says I am crazy.)\n\nShould I rent a car or just use the metro system? If suggested to use the metro, is the metro hard to navigate?\n\nFor accommodation, what are some good/trustworthy websites to book through?\n\nAs a tourist do I have to check in at the nearest police station each time I enter a new city?\n\nIs it hard to get train tickets to other cities?\n\nIs $900 USD good for 18 days?\n\nAny tips or recommendations? (Travelling tips, Sites, What not to do/to do etc.)\n\nThank you in advance! Большое спасибо!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for all the feedback. Everyone was very helpful.\n\nI have changed my itinerary to just Moscow, St. Petersburg and Vladimir. Maybe Kazan if i have extra time. I have tripled my budget so now it should be more than enough. Thank you, I am so excited to see your beautiful country and culture. If anyone is in the cities I mentioned and wants to be friends DM me!"
