All of us at BRCS are grateful for the privilege of shepherding our students as they “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). As an interdenominational Christian school, we partner with parents and local churches to create a strong Biblical foundation for each student. Our goal is to guide our students in developing a biblical worldview that enables them to impact our community for God’s kingdom."
