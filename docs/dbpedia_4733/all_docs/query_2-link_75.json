        "text": "Have you ever had a large task in front of you and found it difficult to know where to begin, but then someone comes along and says, I’ll do it with you, and suddenly you are ready? Your energy and confidence begins to match theirs. The Bible speaks to this interdependence on one another a lot. We need each other.\n\n​\n\nFor years BRCC has been raising funds for missions both globally and locally and we are so thankful for the generosity of our camps families. We’ve helped build houses, dig wells, supply food pantries, translate verses of the Bible, support church plants and more. All the while we’ve been encouraging our campers to dream big dreams with and for God. We encourage campers to make plans to do ministry and fund ministry no matter where life takes them or what they decide to do as a vocation. This year will be no different.\n\n​\n\nBRCC is looking toward the future and we want to ask our campers to help us in a number of ways. We are going to ask for commitments to pray. We are going to brainstorm cool things to bring to or do at BRCC. We are going to ask campers what they love just the way it is and what they want to see next. And we are going to ask them to give to the next steps. AND THEN...We are going to ask our churches to match that giving. How amazing if our campers can see their generosity and excitement matched by others.They get to strike the match and see it grow! Some of our needs are obvious; funds to offset rising costs, an updated pool, a larger dining space, gathering spaces, and additional staffing.\n\nBut we also want to know what campers want to see and we want to allow them to see their faithful giving grow and make a difference. We hope you’ll join us for The Match!\n\n​"
