        "text": "Changes\n\nBy Bruce Cannon\n\nMitchell County\n\nMatthew 24:12 “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”\n\nIf you are like me you are dumbfounded at the changes that have taken place in our country over the past few years. More change has taken place in this short period than what changed over the past several decades. We are heading somewhere in society and it appears to be very dark. There is a force behind it all; and that force is powerful, wicked, united, and determined to undermine all that is good. It is the spirit of the antichrist which has always been at work in our world but is gaining strength quickly as Jesus said it would in the last days.\n\nA few days ago my wife and I were walking in our yard and Wendy asked me, “Can you feel it?” I did not know to what she was referring. I didn’t know how to answer so I responded with a question, “What are you sensing?” She replied, “Change, and it’s not good.” She is very perceptive and felt in her spirit that trouble was afoot; that something was quickly changing in our county/state/nation.\n\nAs you and I listen to the news, as we see what is taking place on our streets and in other areas across our country, we are seeing this change. Lawlessness is rampant; respect for other persons, oneself, and property has waned. And that is exactly what our Lord prophesied would happen before His return. The word translated as “iniquity” in Matthew 24:12 is actually “lawlessness” in the original language. And we are seeing it daily.\n\nConsider some of the more recent lawless activities taking place in America and see if this is so:\n\n*We are attempting to rewrite history rather than learn from it. How many monuments honoring war heroes from our past have been destroyed or removed because they were deemed offensive? I am offended, as are many other believers, at the parading of evil on television, in music, and on the streets of America. What about my rights as a taxpayer? And, what about yours?\n\n*What about the continuing attack upon law enforcement? Where has the effort to “defund police” gotten us? Mark Creech, director of the Christian Action League of North Carolina, stated this about law enforcement, “Law enforcement is the keystone of our civilization; it is what holds society together. Defunding or eliminating police agencies is simply ridiculous and is an agenda being pushed by many of the very so-called leaders who expect special treatment and protection when it comes to their person and property.”\n\n*What about the attack upon the younger in our nation by those bent on putting books in our libraries that promote and teach youth (and older children) how to have sex with peers of the opposite sex and of the same sex? Where has common decency gone?\n\n*What about our changing the sexes of children…in some areas parents don’t have to be notified. Check out this portion of an article released in May of this year: “Beyond notification about the name and pronoun change, schools are not required to include parents in the gender transition. At least three counties — Buncombe, Orange, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools — spell out a gender-transitioning plan where parents are not required to be included. Teachers and other students must “get with the program” or possibly face harassment charges. Orange County specifically classifies refusing to refer to a person by the preferred name or pronouns as a form of “harassment” and requires other school personnel to report a teacher or student if the preferred names and pronouns are not used or that the employee, himself, will be brought up for disciplinary action.” (https://nsjonline.com/article/2024/05/summa-parental/) Notice, the geographical locations considering this action are here in North Carolina; not New York, California, or some other far away area.\n\nYet, the Bible prophesied all this would take place before the Lord came back for His Church. Imagine, you and I could very well be taken to Heaven in what is known as the Rapture of the Church VERY SOON. In Luke 21:28, Jesus stated “And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”\n\nWhat must we do? Draw close to God personally and corporately. Teach our children right from wrong. Stand, in love, for those things the Word approves of and against those things the Word condemns. Vote! Pray for God’s mercy and forgiveness upon our nation. Beg Him! Plead with Him through the blood of Christ for help. And, get ready for the Lord’s Return. Amen!\n\n___________________________________________\n\nBruce Cannon is the Pastor of Pine Branch Baptist Church in Spruce Pine, NC\n\n___________________________________________"
