        "text": "My child started this school as a transfer student after we moved across the state. At the beginning of the year we were trying a new medicine for ADHD, which unfortunately was not working. My child was depressed and could not focus and was acting out. I was concerned he was behind academically due to the move and Covid. I finally got him on the correct medicine and requested testing to make sure he was at the level he needed to be so he would not fall more behind. Staff stated he was where he should be academically. I had my son set up to meet a therapist at the school to get help there. I was told my the therapist that since this was a top performing school, they expected all students to be at that level and did not support those that here not. I never got any feedback from the teacher and I felt like talking to them was not what they wanted and I was wasting their time. It was very hard to get any feedback unless my son was doing something wrong. My last straw was when the principal called my into the office to tell me my son had stolen a candy bar. The teacher was not in the meeting or my son, so I had no way to get the whole story. Apparently the teacher said my son stole it and my son swears the teacher gave it to him then took it back. The conversation immediately went to whether or not we had guns at home. I felt like the issue could have been a misunderstanding, but not having the people involved made it hard to determine. My son was accused of being a thief and I was told that would not be tolerated. At this point I felt like my child was being bullied by the school and nothing he did would be right. I transferred him to a different school and he went from hating school and failing to loving school and thriving. This may be a good school for a perfect child but unfortunately not all children are perfect.\n\nParent Review\n\n10mo ago"
