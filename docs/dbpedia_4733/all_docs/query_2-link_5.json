        "text": "History\n\nBRCA is an independent, non-denominational school which opened in 2004 with students in K5 through 6th grade and has added a grade each year. In 2011 we had our first graduating class with students attending Furman and Anderson University. This year we have been blessed to complete our gymnasium, thereby expanding our athletic venues which already included a cross country course, soccer field, and baseball field.\n\nSpecialties\n\nBRCA offers a Christ-centered, college preparatory education to families in the Upstate of South Carolina and in neighboring towns in North Carolina. Our school has dual accreditation with ACSI and SACS-CASI. We are located 3 miles from North Greenville University and serve children in Pre-K4 through 12th grade. All of our graduates have received scholarships to the university of their choice - praise God!"
