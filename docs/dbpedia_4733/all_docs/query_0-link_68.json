        "text": "In June of 1974, two high school baseball teams from two small towns in South Carolina met for the “1A” state championship. In one dugout sat Bamberg Ehrhardt, a school just south of Orangeburg with a few big names. Mookie Wilson, their pitcher who went on to play for the New York Mets and win the 1986 World Series. The team was also coached by David Horton, the winningest coach in America for high school baseball. In the other dugout sat a different school from a small South Carolina town out in the country, but did not have any names known nationwide or future World Series champions. They did however have a history teacher with a family name that has led their program through hundreds of challenges for the last four decades.\n\n-“I was born in a baseball family and was always on the field because my dad was the coach.”\n\nTravis Henson\n\nOn the edge of the community of Greer, South Carolina away from the swarm of yellow Jacket Fans from Greer High School, lies a single story high school just off of Fews Chapel and Pennington Road. Inside its own den, the Blue Ridge High Tigers have built a community around them where everyone is in it together; everyone knows each other, and EVERYONE IS FAMILY! One man’s name that carries on those community values inside of Blue Ridge is Mr. Travis Henson. Born and raised in the very community where he teaches and coaches today, Henson began his days on the baseball field running around the players stealing their equipment and baseballs then running off with them. Luckily his dad, Jerry Henson was the coach.\n\n-“You could talk to a lot of guys who graduated from Blue Ridge High School who would say I was a little pest, because I would take their hat and take off running with it. Or I would take their baseballs and take off running with it.” Travis Henson.\n\nNow, 43 years later Travis Henson is teaching and coaching those same player’s children in the same community, with his dad by his side watching his son “the little pest” carry on the family tradition leading the Blue Ridge Tigers baseball team on the field. To round all the bases in one of their greatest accomplishments at the ball park together as father and son in 2005. Travis was coaching with his father Jerry at Landrum high in their second state championship appearance. In one dugout sat a man having worked his way up playing for the team his dad coached for over 30 years, to now coaching his own team with his dad by his side. In the other dugout sat coach David Horton and Bamberg Ehrhardt. The same winningest coach in high school baseball with the same school that beat Jerry Henson and Blue Ridge high the year his son Travis was born in the 1974 state championship. In just two games Travis and his dad coached Landrum to shutout Bamberg Ehrhardt 2-0 in game one, then 11-1 in game two, winning the state championship.\n\n-“For me and my dad to team together to beat Bamberg Ehrhardt, which was 31 years after my dad had lost to them in the state championship baseball means a lot to me and my family.” Travis Henson.\n\nThat was the first indicator of just how special this man could be coaching and teaching student-athletes how to be winners. Travis would stay at Landrum for a couple more years coaching their baseball team to another state championship title in 2007 before moving up to the collegiate level coaching baseball for three years at North Greenville University, where he and the Crusaders won the 2010 NCCAA national championship. Then like a fly ball hit deep into right field up into the sun something felt missing inside him. Henson wanted to return to the high school level where he started to become closer with his players on a personal level and guide them not just around the bases for runs, but also around the classroom for their education to make it in the real world. Some would say that he was taking a step back in his career moving down to a lower level, or holding himself back from his full potential being a successful coach who has what it takes to win college championships. That didn’t matter to Henson – to him it was a new investment that was more personal coming home, to influence students on the baseball field, in the hallways, and in the classrooms in the school and community his dad taught in for 42 years and where he grew up and played all his life.\n\n“Here I am teaching in a classroom that I sat in as a student, so it’s neat to be in there and this community means so much to me. That’s why my goal is to win a state championship at Blue Ridge High School. What could be more special than doing it for your home?” Travis Henson.\n\nPeople may look at someone who stays in one spot their whole life doing the same job at the same place as only knowing one role in life. For coach Henson his journey through a close family and faith based community like Blue Ridge has taught him three roles in life. Yet, using those three roles to teach and guide more than 3,000 lives in his career as a coach, teacher, and youth minister at Washington Baptist Church. Before work every morning Henson wakes up and gives himself a moment of silence to say a prayer to God thanking him for another day, and giving him the strength and courage to go out and serve his hometown. The community service for this man goes on non-stop between the classroom, baseball field, and church. One of Henson’s motivations to achieve his goal to move the Blue Ridge community forward and teach kids success in life is always being there in the mind where you stand.\n\n“It’s all through God’s strength number one, but secondly wherever you are be there. When I’m on the baseball field that’s where I have to be, or when I’m in the classroom I can’t be thinking about the baseball field I have to be focused on students. And when I’m at church I can’t be thinking about baseball, I can’t be thinking about the classroom I got to be focused on God.” Travis Henson.\n\nIt’s easy to tell coach Henson brings out his personal motivations in life to pass on to his boys on the baseball field and children in church. Just sitting down for an interview talking to him after a normal mid-week practice on a cold cloudy day in the baseball locker room he speaks to you just as loud, fast, strong, and positive as if you were one of his players right before a championship game in the dugout on a day with beautiful weather, that makes baseball what it is in America. The preacher’s voice combined with the coache’s voice comes out with a tone more powerful than a fast pitch from the mound to home plate. For coach Henson this is how you teach players to dedicate themselves to success on the field, and in the classroom balancing out time and life to be successful at both.\n\n“The way we start practice every day which is different than some teams is I get the team together and give a motivational speech before every practice because I want to set the tone. Because if you’re not here mentally what you’re about to do physically won’t matter and our guys understand that.” Travis Henson\n\nSuccess for Blue Ridge baseball is an understatement. Now, being under the leadership of coach Henson for several years, one year ago the Tigers came off a season winning 17 straight games along with the Region II 3-A title against cross town rival Greer High. With the community all out in the stands, many team parents who graduated from Blue Ridge throughout the years and former players, played with Travis Henson in high school or were coached by his dad Jerry Henson. This was the first regional championship won by Blue Ridge since 2006. All at once the players stormed the field running to home plate cheering and jumping on each other in celebration. The crowd was on their feet cheering in joy, while fireworks were shot off from the fire department next door creating an environment like you were at a Major League Baseball game. Playing and coaching the game for over 30 years that game goes down as one of Henson’s favorite baseball memories. But the important thing to him as a coach is you have to live in the moment.\n\n“I think that game is something I will always cherish and no one can take that away from us I thought it was a very special moment. But one key to success as a player and coach is you got to live in the moment. One day I will look back on all these games and reflect all my memories because I could tell you every detail of a game 5 years ago, but what drives me is you got to look for that next moment.” Travis Henson.\n\nMany moments have come and gone for coach Henson in his teaching career at Blue Ridge as well. Walking through those front doors of that school every day for some students is like a family tradition passed down from generation to generation. For some families it can feel just like that seeing the last name Henson on their child’s class schedule as well. When you take the amount of years Travis Henson and his father Jerry Henson have put into teaching at Blue Ridge high school, the total adds up to over half a century. Three generations of students growing up in that community were taught by those two men and to this day the Henson family tradition continues with Travis’ life goal of helping as many people as he can in his life.\n\n“My life goal is to be a positive influence on as many people as I possibly can. I pray that God gives me that opportunity and I believe that he has because through teaching and coaching I have that opportunity.” Travis Henson.\n\nA couple of seniors this year on his team that are pure examples of coach Henson’s work influencing lives is Brandon Southern and Elijah Henderson. Both young men have spent their last four years playing for Blue Ridge under coach Henson, and are now about to graduate and play the sport they love at the college level. Southern has signed with Toccoa Falls, while Henderson will travel from one Tiger den to the other and play at Clemson University. They both have learned from coach Henson’s motivation growing up through high school under his baseball program. Racking up several homeruns for the team already just halfway through the 2017 season, Elijah came out of the season opener tournament at Berea High School with a grand slam. While Brandon knocked one out of the park against Southside Christian Academy forcing the pitcher to stop throwing him balls that were worth swinging at, sending number 15 walking to first base after ball four.\n\nAnyone can walk onto a field and monitor athletes for a couple hours letting them just play around and call themselves a coach. Anyone can walk into a classroom and read off lessons to students and call themselves a teacher. Even in the church anyone can pick up a bible, read some scriptures, go to every Sunday gathering and call themselves a Christian who serves God even if they don’t mean it. But only a true community Icon will grow up in his community being by his dad’s side everyday by the baseball field as a little kid, to his high school days putting on the black and red uniform representing the Blue Ridge Tigers. Then going off to get his college degree, to come back home to the same school and community that made him who he is today and use what it made of him to want to give all those same values back to future generations in Blue Ridge to come. Becoming a coach, teacher and church youth minister Henson gives his hometown the values of family, faith, support, education, dedication, motivation, and love.\n\nAll the reasons why Travis Henson is the Blue Ridge Tiger that never left the den."
