Welcome to Veritas Christian Academy located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains between Hendersonville and Asheville, North Carolina.

OUR MISSION

Intelligent Faith: Equipping minds and engaging hearts for God’s Kingdom purposes. It is our goal to be an educational community that is classical and Christ-centered in content, approach, and administration.

​

Veritas is dedicated to providing children a quality education in the tradition of Western culture and historic, biblical Christianity. Emphasis is placed upon teaching students how to think and how to learn, preparing them for a breadth of post-secondary educational opportunities. Curriculum and educational methods employed are intended to meet the academic, social, cultural, and spiritual needs of the traditional learner.

​

THE CLASSICAL DIFFERENCE

Classical education movement leader, Christopher Perrin, has written an article entitled “What is Classical Education” – this is a good resource for understanding Classical Education. Veritas also has a growing Common Arts program. Learn more about this here.

ABOUT OUR CAMPUS

Veritas Christian Academy's current facility is situated on 9.2 acres and includes a Logic and Rhetoric School building, Grammar School building, Learning Center for Nature Study, cafeteria, gymnasium, playground, and athletic fields.

TUITION INFORMATION

If your family will be seeking tuition assistance, then one essential step in the application process is to also apply for the North Carolina Opportunity Scholarship. At Veritas, receiving tuition assistance is based on need.

Veritas Christian Academy recognizes that the costs of Christian education are substantial and that some families who would benefit from it may not have adequate resources. The primary purpose of the VCA Tuition Assistance Program is to provide tuition assistance to those families who, without such assistance, would be unable to send their children to VCA.

​

FACTS

Families seeking tuition assistance must complete the admissions process before they apply for assistance. After being accepted into Veritas, an application must be filed with FACTS, an independent financial aid management organization. Please note that assistance is given for one year only, and therefore families must reapply each year.

Please call (828-681-0546) or email admissionsdirector@veritasnc.org for exact tuition for the specific grade in which you are interested.
