BIOGRAPHY

From an early age Razan exhibited a strong passion for all things related to art. Born and raised in Saudi Arabia, however, Razan found herself in an environment not conducive to artistic creativity. Determined to pursue her passion formally and further develop as an artist Razan applied to The School of Museum of Fine Arts and TUFTS University in Boston, Massachusetts where she spent her college years. While there, she concentrated on sculpture, screen-printing, and papermaking. Running parallel to her passion for art all these years was Razan’s love of fashion. Since graduating, Razan has dedicated herself exclusively to this field, and developing her own clothing line.

Rather than abandoning her art roots, Razan’s education paved the way for creating articles of clothing that are not only creative and original but sculptural as well and which heavily draw on her earlier influences.

Razan’s clothing is all about exuding the femininity, delicacy and grace of the female form. Razan derives most of her inspiration from women themselves and their natural poise. Each piece in her collection is intended to show off its wearer in an elegant light, while maintaining a sense of playfulness as well. The use of soft luxurious textures is dominant and allows for movement in the clothes, which adds a whimsical quality to the collection. The combination of chiffon and silk lends to the idea of women as soft, ethereal beings, which only enhances their femininity. The unique hand beaded pieces of the collection reflect the meticulousness, layers, and detail that have gone into creating each of Razan’s signature flowers. Razan’s pieces maintain sculptural and artistic integrity, as well as transport the wearer into the glamorous and sophisticated realm.
