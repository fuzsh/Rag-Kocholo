        "text": "Razan Al Mubarak is a United Arab Emirates native who for more than twenty years has played a vital role in guiding her country toward a more sustainable future while spearheading progressive environmental protection and species conservation across West Asia and globally.\n\nHer diverse experience leading the largest environmental regulatory agency in the Middle East, an international philanthropic organization supporting species conservation projects worldwide, and an NGO focused on citizen engagement earned her recognition as one of the top 100 Young Global Leaders by the World Economic Forum in 2018. In 2021, Al Mubarak was elected IUCN President for a 4-year term.\n\nWhen she was appointed managing director of the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) in 2010, Razan became the youngest person to lead an Abu Dhabi government entity and one of the only women to hold such a position. Under her guidance and leadership, the government agreed to double its protected wildlife areas and adopt the region’s first carbon targets: a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. She has also overseen one of the world’s most ambitious mammalian species reintroduction programs: the breeding of captive Scimitarhorned oryx in Abu Dhabi and reintroducing them back into the wild in Chad, thus seeing a species that is listed as Extinct in the Wild now increase its numbers in its natural habitat. Under her guidance, the EAD has established global partnerships like the Eye on Earth environmental data initiative, convened four meetings of IUCN Species Survival Commission since 2008, and hosted one of the Convention on Migratory Species’ two offices.\n\nRazan is also the founding director of the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, helping to build the organization into one of the world’s largest philanthropic foundations supporting direct species conservation. Since its inception the Fund has supported more than 2,000 species conservation projects in over 160 countries, bringing many species back from the brink of extinction.\n\nShe began her career in conservation in 2001 when she helped establish Emirates Nature, an NGO associated with the World Wildlife Fund. As its managing director, she has spearheaded initiatives to protect the UAE’s coral, conducted field surveys that led to the establishment of the country’s first mountain national park, and created the framework and culture to protect nesting and migrating sea turtles.\n\nWithin the UAE, Razan chairs the board of directors for the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture and is a board member for numerous environmental influencers and stakeholders, including Masdar, a renewable energy company based in Abu Dhabi. Internationally, she is an advisory board member of the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health, the Cambridge Conservation Initiative, and the Emirates Diplomatic Academy, and is a board member of Panthera and the Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy Initiative (WiSER). A keen supporter of the arts, cultural preservation, and development, she serves as a member of the Board of Advisors to the Abu Dhabi Music and Arts Foundation."
