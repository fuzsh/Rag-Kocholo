        "text": "Razan, tell us your story.\n\nI started designing in 2008. I was born in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and I went to university in Boston. I went to the School of Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nA friend of mine (Natalya Rovner, LuxCartel partner) wore one of my dresses to a Vanity Fair party in Miami. Then, later on, she commissioned a dress for a friend’s wedding in Italy. After the Vanity Fair event, there was a lot of feedback regarding the dress. One of the Editors from Vanity Fair called me wanting to do a feature. She asked for the company registration information. But, I didn’t have a company—I was still a student. So I went home for Spring Break, opened a company, and came back and said, “There you go!”\n\nI started designing—but that’s not what I initially set out to do. Going to art school, I thought I would be more into sculpture. But it’s a nice transition because I started using fashion as my art outlet.\n\nI play a lot with the beading and embroidery; I like to create sculptural beading. I always saw my work as “wearable couture”. The intricate beading is the haute couture grade but at the same time, the brand is accessible. I love the idea that you can wear something so intricate, but even the beading moves and comes across as natural. When we bead, we bead in different directions so that it doesn’t stiffen up the fabric.\n\nSo you came back home with a Vanity Fair piece. That must have been a big bang for you. And on Instagram you have tens of thousands of followers. Why are those people following you—a young designer—rather than an established designer?\n\nI think that they are interested to see what will come next.\n\nI kind of like the shock factor with our Instagram followers, in particular. Whenever we showcase a new piece, we get their feedback. Social media is a big part of the culture of the brand. Honestly, what I appreciate most is that I can see how clients feel when they wear Razan Al Azzouni.\n\nAnd because they hashtag us…we will see a woman at a wedding and she will express that she feels glamorous, or another in the street… It’s always nice to understand what pieces bring out people’s emotions, rather than just knowing it is getting sold, or that it is mainstream fashion… I never wanted that.\n\nWhat is the major roadblock in the Middle East for designers to become a household name?\n\nThe fact that the industry does not exist. If I was able to intern, talk to someone for advice, find the right model—we fly in our models every time we do a shoot because no one is the proper size or has the proper look. You want a model to be simple so that the clothes can show; you don’t get that here, so we always fly our models in. It is bothersome that these things are not available to us here especially when there is such high demand.\n\nThere are what, 800 couture buyers in the world? 300 of them are from the Middle East.\n\nExactly.\n\nHow insane is that? 300 from the world are from the Middle East. That’s more than a third!\n\nDo you think that the couture buyers would rather go to Giambattista Valli or Chanel or are they now starting to spend more on Middle Eastern designers?\n\nWomen are brand-obsessed but the couture women that have always dressed with style and elegance will go to new designers. They go to Chanel because they like the style. Women who understand quality will go for a new designer because they like and understand the quality.\n\nWe just opened the couture division to cover our bridal and other kinds of dresses that women want for exclusive occasions. And we learned that women dress in couture on a daily basis. A woman will go to take tea decked out in couture. But when she goes to a wedding, she doesn’t want people to know what her dress is—she wants people to stay guessing, but they know it is quality because she only wears quality. Especially in Saudi and Kuwait.\n\nWomen are proud of wearing a regional designer. They are proud but they are picky at the same time. If the quality is not good, they will tell you."
