        "text": "I enjoy writing about overcoming challenges that I, along with many other teens, have gone through. I think it’s important that my stories have lessons people can take away when they finish reading. I try to write stories I know others will relate and connect to. I want my stories to address worries many people have, while also being comforting. Writing has helped me understand myself more. I’ve learned a lot more about my preferred writing style after i joined this program.\n\nMarah’s double life is interrupted, forcing her to come to terms with finally stepping out of her comfort zone and living life for herself.\n\nMarah lives a double life; she hasn’t told teachers friends or family about quitting teaching: afraid of letting them down. She struggles with the idea of starting over and stepping out of her comfort zone.\n\nThis is a story about two long-distance sisters. One struggling with anxiety, and one who desperately wants to help but doesn’t know how."
