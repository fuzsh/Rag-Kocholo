        "text": "Persistence and resilience define Razan Ibraheemâ€™s life. She was born in Syrin and raised in Latakia. In her understanding, Razan studied Irish and English literature which opened her eyes wide and made her fall in love with Ireland even before arriving. Razan worked for 10 years to afford doing masters in Limerick University.\n\nAs the uprising in her home country began, Razan witnessed six months of the conflict that carve her memories forever. Her deep sorrow for the tragic situation and the mass displacement in her homeland has led her to volunteer in Greece to help refugees. She gave a speech with the former UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, in Ireland. In 2016, she was invited by the UN to a high-level meeting on global responsibility sharing for pathways for admission of Syrian refugees.\n\nRazan is a journalist and editor with extensive expertise in researching misinformation and disinformation online. Razan has reported and verified thousands of videos from across the world including Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.\n\nShe is a regular contributor to various newspaper articles and current events programmes on Irish radio and TV.Her verification work has been included in reports across many prominent media organisations and news websites including New York Time, WSJ, and The Irish Times. Razan provided additional research for the New York Times visual investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2020. Razan was awarded the International Woman of the Year by Irish Tatler in 2016.\n\nRazan has dedicated her work to challenging stereotypes as women, an immigrant and a refugee. Throughout her life, she has failed, succeeded, risen and started from zero all over again. Her life experience has turned her to a compelling storyteller full of passion and compassion."
