        "text": "Contrary to popular belief, the majority of migrants are women. In 2020, women accounted for 51.6% of European migrants. Yet women newcomers are often overlooked when it comes to drawing up migration policies, and are hardly visible in the public arena or in the media. To mark International Women’s Rights Day, SINGA is giving a voice to newcomer women to make their stories visible, so that they can take possession of the public arena and highlight the projects they have launched.\n\nRazan Elkhatib is a Sudanese multidisciplinary artist, short-film director, and cinema enthusiast.\n\nCan you introduce yourself in a few words?\n\nI am a Sudanese multidisciplinary artist with a passion for film. I joined the College of Communication Sciences in 2012, where I studied multimedia. After graduating, I worked on media production for several years, but kept writing and film production close to my heart.\n\nI produced my first-short film, “Amal”, in 2012, which I wrote and directed to fight against female genital mutilation. After that, I joined many workshops inside and outside Sudan and participated in many film and art festivals. I made short-films mainly about women’s struggles, wherever they were. And since arriving in Montreal, I’m working on a short film about immigrant women who arrive in Montreal and learn to ride a bike for the first time because it wasn’t allowed in their culture of origin.\n\nI’ve also done voluntary work with various NGOs and activist groups, in the fields of family health, FGM (female genital mutilation), disabled people, environmental issues, peace and gender.\n\nI’m generally a very emotional person, I get attached to people and things easily, I cry a lot when I’m happy or sad. I love discovering places, people’s stories and tastes in food. My life has been full of challenges and adventures, and I’m lucky to have a lovely family, friends from all over the world, a creative soul and a big heart.\n\nWhen did you arrive in Quebec, and from which country?\n\nI am grateful to have been born and raised in Sudan, a diverse country with a great history and rich in natural resources. But because of the most horrific injustices committed by dictators, thousands of protesters filled the streets of Sudan from December 2018. The authorities used live ammunition to disperse the protesters, leaving dozens dead and injured. More than 800 anti-government protesters were arrested. I was among the demonstrators and I didn’t feel safe, which forced me to leave Sudan.\n\nI arrived in Montreal in May 2019, fell in love with it and decided to live here. I started studying French. I quickly felt a sense of belonging when I discovered that most of the people I met here were first, second and third generation immigrants from all over the world. I began to feel that Canada was a miniature world in which everyone could feel safe.\n\nWhat were the main difficulties you encountered when you arrived? Do you think these difficulties were exacerbated by the fact that you are a woman?\n\nAs a refugee, I’ve faced many challenges, from the asylum process to rebuilding my life from scratch, and being away from my family who are facing the danger of war in Sudan. When I moved from Sudan to Canada, everything seemed different. I had to learn a lot of new skills.\n\nFor almost a year since my arrival, I’ve been looking for a job that interests me and respects my human values. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to work for SINGA Québec as part of the ‘Un Rêve dans Votre Assiette’ project. It was my first time working as a chef. But it was an enjoyable challenge. The project is about cultural exchange around traditional food, how it’s cooked and how it’s eaten. I found myself surrounded by people concerned about social responsibility and the environment. I learned a lot from them, and made some valuable friendships.\n\nHow did SINGA support you?\n\nThe SINGA Québec team has been invaluable to me since my first year as an immigrant woman in Montreal. Their inclusive approach and willingness to create links between newcomers and the local community has been essential for me in my transition to my new life.\n\nI’m grateful to have been working with SINGA Québec since 2020, producing audiovisual content for the organization with a very diligent and creative team. I have a flexible schedule, which allows me to pursue my other artistic projects.\n\nTo find out more about SINGA Québec : @singaquebec\n\nWhat are you most proud of today?\n\nI am proud of my resilience and courage in embarking on such a difficult journey, leaving behind all that is familiar and venturing into the unknown. I’m proud of my ability to adapt and thrive in a new culture, and to have taken the opportunity to learn new social skills and broaden my outlook.\n\nI have worked hard to integrate into the Quebec community, while being a representative of my Sudanese culture and heritage, and trying to contribute positively to society by sharing my experiences and perspectives.\n\nOverall, my journey to Montreal has been challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. Despite the obstacles, I have remained focused on pursuing my goals and healing from all the damage that happens to us along this difficult journey. I’m proud of the person I’ve become and the resilience I’ve shown. I’m optimistic about the future and grateful for the opportunities I have.\n\nWhat are your dreams and plans for the future?\n\nOne of my main goals is to create independent films that tell not only my own immigrant story, but also the meaningful experiences of other women. By sharing these stories, I hope to encourage understanding and connection between audiences, contributing to greater acceptance and inclusion in Quebec society and around the world.\n\nI also hope for peace and stability in my native Sudan. The war that began in April 2023 has caused immeasurable suffering to countless individuals and families, including my own. I believe that diversity is a source of strength and enrichment for society, and I am determined to fight discrimination and prejudice. I dream of a world where the color of a person’s skin is never used as a basis for discrimination or oppression, where everyone has equal opportunities and rights and where justice prevails for all.\n\nWhat message would you like to pass on to other women from a migrant background? If you had any advice for a woman who has just arrived, what would you tell her?\n\nAs migrant women, we face obstacles that are often difficult to overcome, but I firmly believe in our ability to support each other and rise together. We have immense potential and a unique ability to make a valuable contribution to our communities. We must remember never to underestimate our ability to adapt and succeed in a new environment. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed at times, but it’s important to remember that every challenge we overcome strengthens our resilience and determination.\n\nAt SINGA, we work to liberate and highlight the strength and potential of newcomer women. 53% of the people we support are women. By supporting SINGA, you are helping to support and empower hundreds of newcomer women every year, fostering a world where everyone, regardless of gender or background, can flourish and fulfill their dreams!\n\n__\n\nInterview as part of SINGA Global’s campaign to raise awareness of International Women’s Rights Day on 8 March 2024."
