        "text": "Razan’s Journey\n\nPublished on 01/08/2024\n\nRazan’s Literacy Journey & Dreams Of More\n\nQuotes from Razan, 14\n\nI am 14 years old. I’ve been at the education centre for three years now. Before that, I stayed home.\n\nI have two sisters and three brothers. Three of my siblings also learn here but one of my brothers recently left. He went back to Syria because he has a throat illness and needed treatment.\n\nMy dad is a day labourer and my mom is a housewife. My dad has been working in Lebanon as a day labourer since before I was born.\n\nMy life changed when I started going to the education centre. I learned so many things here, things I didn’t know before. For example, using a computer. I didn’t know what that was before.\n\nI started learning coding when I was in Grade 4 (two years ago). I used to only use a phone to watch videos.\n\nIn my first coding class, I was a bit scared and nervous. I had never worked on a computer before. Then, we became familiar with the teacher who turned out very nice and funny so I became less nervous about class.\n\nI’m usually bold so when I put my fear aside, I started enjoying class. The first time I sat at a computer, I kept thinking: will I be able to use it? Will I understand how it works and learn to use it? Then we started class and I realised that it wasn’t that hard after all. When we put our minds to something, we’ll achieve our goal.\n\nWhat I like most about coding class is the projects that we do in class. My favourite project was when we coded a digital piano and with a micro:bit, a pedometer. What was also great is that each group did a different project.\n\nYesterday, my younger sister told my teacher that I won’t stop talking about coding class at home. Make her stop! So yeah, I guess I like to speak with my siblings about what I learn in class so that they can also learn about coding. Next year, my sister will start her coding classes, so it’s nice for her to already know a bit about coding. If a friend is interested, I also talk about coding.\n\nI’m very proud of myself. I aspire for more but then I remember that I’m still young and that life is ahead of me.\n\nLast month, we chatted with Razan, an inspiring 14-year-old Syrian girl who studies with us at a non-formal education centre in Beirut.\n\nRazan‘s father has worked as a daily labourer in Lebanon since before she was born. “We wanted to all be together as a family,” she says, reflecting on their move to Lebanon in 2016. With the economic crisis, her family moved around a lot. Four years ago, the family of eight settled in a small apartment in a refugee camp in Beirut’s suburbs.\n\nLife in this area is really tough. For example, as the eldest girl, Razan has always had to help her mom, a housewife, at home. She does dishes, sweeps floors, and sometimes even cooks. The family doesn’t own a washing machine and one of Razan’s weekly gruesome chores is to hand wash the family’s clothes.\n\n“My life changed when I started learning”\n\nRazan’s mother signed her up at the non-formal education centre when she turned 10. Razan is the first in her family to attend an education centre. “I was very happy to come learn at the centre. I grew confident that I can do well. My life changed when I started learning. I learned so many things here, things I didn’t know before. I felt happy because I felt I was someone smart.” Attending the education centre has been a transformative experience for Razan. Before, she didn’t know how to read or write. Now, her favourite subjects are theatre and English.\n\nSeeing a computer for the first time at age 11\n\nRazan’s digital literacy journey began in Grade 4. “I had never worked on a computer before, I didn’t know what that was. In my first class, I was a bit scared and nervous. Then, we became familiar with the teacher who turned out very nice and funny so I became less nervous about class. The first time I sat at a computer, I kept thinking: will I be able to use it? Will I understand how it works and learn to use it? Then I realised that it wasn’t that hard after all. I’m usually bold so when I put my fear aside, I started enjoying class. If we put our minds to something, we’ll achieve our goal.” she admits.\n\nRazan became comfortable using tech and started learning to code at the end of the last academic year. “I’ve been learning coding for 2 years now. What I like most about coding class is the projects that we do in class. My favourite project was when we coded a digital piano and a pedometer. What was also great is that each group did a different project and we learned from one another.”\n\nOutside of the centre, Razan practices coding on her family’s phone. She loves sharing what she learns with her siblings and friends. “Yesterday, my younger sister told my teacher that I won’t stop talking about coding class at home. Make her stop!”. Razan’s passion for coding is contagious. “Next year, my sister will start her coding classes, so it’s nice for her to already know a bit about coding.”\n\nRazan aspires for more\n\nCoding class taught Razan skills that have nothing to do with coding. “It taught me patience. At the beginning, I thought I wouldn’t be able to understand anything. Then I started to think, I’m a person who can learn to do anything. Why be nervous or scared? Now I wait for class and appreciate every second so that I can learn more! I learned to be patient and that things will come to those who wait.”\n\nLearning to code also made Razan aspire for more. “I’m very proud of myself. Now, I aspire to be more but then I remember that I’m still young and that life is ahead of me. When I finish learning here at the centre, I hope to become a nurse. I want to work here, in this area so I can help the community.”"
