        "text": "As we continue our series on the 2016 Gold Medal Portfolio recipients, we turn the focus onto two students who use their art and writing to explore the people in their daily lives. Razan Elbaba’s art attempts to transform the way many people view women in hijabs while Allison Jiang uses poetry to describe the beauty she sees around her and in others. Their works allow us to see the world, and humanity, through new eyes.\n\nRazan Elbaba is from Vienna, Virginia, and attends Oakton High School.\n\n“My portfolio, Covered, aims to shed light on identity. I often photograph women in hijab, or Islamic headdress, to bring them into the spotlight. By doing this, these women receive the opportunity to effectively symbolize themselves as who they truly are: peaceful individuals, who are aiming to spark a positive change in the world. By giving these women importance, the world will be interested to learn more and realize that the individuals in the pictures are human like everyone else and these women will be able to make their mark and flaunt their strength and fierceness. I use materials like newspaper print, colored googly eyes, cloth, transparent and shiny paper, glitter, and mirrors to increase the variety of my work as well as incorporate meaning into the type of media used. For example, for Breaking News and American Role Models I used newspaper to replace the hijab to express Hijaby women in the media.”\n\nAllison Jiang is from Holmdel, New Jersey, and attends Holmdel High School.\n\n“Olivia Moon”\n\nOlivia Moon is the seagull in all the guided meditation audiotapes, sitting on the mast that\n\nflies away at the end;\n\nOlivia Moon is a olive-skinned almond-eyed hurricane in a world of crayon color labels like cerulean blue and goldenrod.\n\nPeople feel like they can ask her things like\n\nwhere do you get your confidence? to which she will toss her hair;\n\nOlivia Moon is physically unable to hear questions that are impossible to answer.\n\nOlivia Moon was sent here from the sky gods,\n\nborn from a smoking crater. She thinks she is the one who will start the new world order when really\n\nher parents the sky gods were half-joking.\n\nOlivia Moon is always joking;\n\npeople (the same people from before!) say that this will lead to problems.\n\nShe is an orb of flickering blue light\n\nthat sometimes goes out but only for a second;\n\nshe wears lipstick that looks like magic in the mirror but\n\nis a little washed out on camera.\n\nOlivia Moon is the eye for imbalance,\n\nlooking out through a sepia filter and\n\ntasting the world.\n\n“for you”\n\nI listened to the human noise we sat there making and I wonder if there\n\ncould ever be anything\n\nmore beautiful than this.\n\nOur eyes rustle like jungle animals—the dancing orbs make\n\nsuch noise, clanging about the walls of the room like a\n\nLiberty bell. I meet yours in the dark; everyone’s are dull and round and so I say:\n\nFor you whose image is wrapped around me like blankets;\n\nfor you who I find in my calloused fingerprints, and\n\nfor you who sees the world through people-colored lenses:\n\nI want to scream to you this until I physically cannot, I want for the hallways of time to freeze for you and I to dance through them\n\nI want\n\nto hear a new language of us spring from this cold pit of my stomach where I keep all my words and\n\nhear it say:\n\nFor you who I have waited nights (and years and lifetimes and pages for!),\n\nI want to pluck the stars from the sky and place\n\nthem on your tongue.\n\nFor you whose voice I hear in Bible verses and for you whose heart was made out of the same love as mine—\n\nFor you who I see most clearly in this needle-fog of human and tree and God,\n\nTake me away from this headiness; I want to feel a new kind of dizzy—\n\nTogether let’s invent\n\na time when we wore our poems on our sleeves and used our mouths for speaking—\n\ninvent a place where maybe we can be more than specks on a zoomed-out slide—\n\nDo you see this too? You pulse through me like a headache behind my left eye and feel\n\nso,\n\nso heavy.\n\n“peoplewatching”\n\nThere are times when I like,\n\nwhen life is not too fast,\n\nto sit on a bench in the corner of my mind and watch\n\nthe faces, like flags, like signposts\n\nrush past like gods,\n\neach an exciting new book to read.\n\nAnd I wonder how we all fit\n\non this earth, so small\n\nwhen there is so much big loving to be done.\n\nI wonder these things and I cradle my heart in my hands;\n\nThe strangers roll around like marbles in a frying pan.\n\nThere is a pretty green one. It looks like a cat’s eye. Here’s a big one. I wonder what his\n\nchildren are like.\n\nI rub them into my skin for when life gets old."
