        "text": "The International Diabetes Federation is deeply saddened to share the news of the unexpected passing of Razan Shetaiwi, a member of the IDF Young Leaders in Diabetes (YLD) programme from Jordan,\n\nRazan was a law student and a fervent diabetes advocate for the rights and needs of children living with diabetes. A YLD advocate since 2021, she developed her project, in collaboration with the Jordanian Society for the Care of Diabetes (JSCD), to integrate and empower young people with diabetes. Her campaigns to raise awareness about diabetes and build support communities contributed to fostering health communication and patient agency. The JSCD will continue these efforts in her memory.\n\nA keen participant at the YLD Leadership Training Summit during the IDF World Diabetes Congress 2022 in Lisbon, Razan left a lasting impression on her fellow young leaders and the IDF team. We remember her for her enthusiasm and eagerness to contribute.\n\nAlthough her time as an advocate was tragically cut short, Razanâ€™s commitment and care have left an enduring impression on the diabetes community. She will forever be in our hearts and minds. At the same time, we continue working together to improve the lives of people with diabetes."
