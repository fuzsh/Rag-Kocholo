        "text": "Hayashi Razan (born August 1583, Kyōto, Japan—died Feb. 4, 1657, Edo [now Tokyo]) was a Japanese scholar who, with his son and grandson, established the thought of the great Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher Chu Hsi as the official doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate (the hereditary military dictatorship through which the Tokugawa family ruled Japan from 1603 to 1867). Hayashi also reinterpreted Shintō, the Japanese national religion, from the point of view of Chu Hsi’s philosophy, laying the foundation for the Confucianized Shintō that developed in later centuries.\n\nHayashi began as a student of Buddhism but became a devoted adherent of Neo-Confucianism and a bitter opponent of Buddhism. In 1604 he became a pupil of the Confucian scholar Fujiwara Seika and on the recommendation of his master was employed by the shogunate, beginning in 1607. He served the first four Tokugawa shoguns, tutoring them in Neo-Confucianism and history. At the same time, he was engaged in scholarly activities and in the drafting of diplomatic documents. The first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu, may simply have wanted to make use of Hayashi’s vast knowledge for the purpose of practical politics and conduct of international affairs. But Hayashi’s philosophy, with its emphasis on loyalty, on a hierarchical social and political order, and on a static conservative point of view, proved to be a powerful support for the newly established government, giving the Tokugawa the ideology needed to rule the restless feudal lords under their control. In 1630 the third shogun gave Hayashi an estate in the capital city of Edo (now Tokyo), where he founded his private academy. This later came under the direct control and support of the government.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhilosophy 101"
