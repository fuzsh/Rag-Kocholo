You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nMy name is Razan Al Sadder. I am the mother of two children with the third on the way. After graduating from Al Najah University, I worked with Al Nayzak Organization. Then, I moved to the UAE with my husband. While living abroad, I sought out opportunities to advance my career, enrolling in various courses related to networking, IoT, and cloud. I had an official STEAM TOT certification from Dubai and I trained in various ages of robotics and STEAM-related topics. I enjoyed teaching but realized it wasn’t my calling. I wanted to pursue opportunities that applied my degree and skills in cloud computing, so I started to look for related jobs.\n\nMy career path took an unexpected turn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I returned back to Palestine. The move back was challenging – on top of a global pandemic, I found myself in a scarce job market. I struggled to find suitable job opportunities but eventually secured temporary employment as a STEM and robotics trainer in Ramallah. The commute to Ramallah was expensive and exhausting, especially as a mother of young children. Still, the opportunity kept me involved in tech, so I stayed with it as a short-term option.\n\nI kept searching for ways to revive my career and reorient it in the direction of cloud computing. I stumbled upon an advertisement for a cloud computing course in Nablus run by Gaza Sky Geeks in partnership with Stichting SPARK I immediately jumped at the opportunity. I had completed a course with HP back in the UAE and got certified, but the training was focused solely on hardware. The Gaza Sky Geeks cloud computing program was more comprehensive and advanced and was the perfect stepping stone at this stage in my career.\n\nThe Gaza Sky Geeks course was challenging and a big time commitment. The long training hours were particularly daunting, especially when it came to balancing childcare and my pregnancy. I felt a responsibility to stay committed, and with the support of my family and husband, I completed the course.\n\nI admit I was exhausted by the end of the course, but I did it – I completed all the requirements and passed the certification exam! And in a few weeks, I’ll welcome our third child into my family, while embarking on my cloud computing career as a freelancer.\n\nRazan's story is a testament to the determination of Gaza Sky Geeks’ community members, and the impact Gaza Sky Geeks and Stichting SPARK has on the lives of Palestinians. We admire Razan’s career and motherhood journey and celebrate her as a role model for Palestinian women."
