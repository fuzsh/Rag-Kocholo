        "text": "DUBAI: Saudi fashion designer Razan Alazzouni has partnered with The Walt Disney Company to launch a special edition collection inspired by Disney princess Snow White.\n\nIt is the first collaboration between Disney and an Arab designer and features a number of looks for boys and girls aged 2-8, as well as for women. The line, which was handmade in the Middle East, was inspired by nature, wildlife and Snow White herself.\n\nThe children’s line marks a relatively new route for Alazzouni, who released her first-ever children’s collection in March 2020 in collaboration with Kuwait-based kids apparel label Moonchild.\n\nThe new Disney campaign images feature models holding a red apple in a visual tribute to the much-loved 19th century fairy tale which got the Disney treatment with the 1937 film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”\n\nThe collection was launched in celebration of Disney’s 100th anniversary and will be available on the Razan Alazzouni website, as well as through select retailers.\n\n“It is such an honor to collaborate with Disney on this collection. Working with this iconic character is a dream. Disney to me has always been a beacon of creativity and imagination. To be able to create clothing that will give RA the opportunity to be part of people’s occasions and share in these memories is a privilege,” the designer said in a released statement.\n\nBorn in Alkhobar, the designer launched her brand in 2008 and is known for her silks, free-flowing fabrics and decorous embroidery.\n\nAlazzouni studied Art and Sculpture in Boston at Tufts University before setting up her design studio, alongside sisters Salwa and Raya, in AlKhobar and later in Riyadh. In the designer’s bid to keep her business as local as possible, all manufacturing and operations happen in the label’s two studios in Saudi Arabia, while the fashion house sources materials from Europe and Japan.\n\nHer creations are known for merging premium materials such as silk and chiffon with embellishments, including beading, floral details and delicate sequin work with a focus on the garment’s sculptural form.\n\nThe designer has dressed the likes of US actresses Elizabeth Banks and Emma Roberts, US socialite Paris Hilton and US model Kendall Jenner. Alazzouni also recently launched her Ramadan 2023 collection, complete with a number of delicate kaftans boasting playful details like scalloped sleeves and pearl detailing.\n\nDUBAI: Tunisian filmmaker Ala Eddine Slim’s third feature film, “Agora,” supported by Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Fund, won the Pardo Verde Award – also known as the Green Award – at the 2024 Locarno Film Festival, where it had its world premiere.\n\nThe Pardo Verde Award is given to a film that best reflects an environmental theme and is unafraid of asking difficult questions.\n\nSlim’s two previous works also made noise on the world stage. His 2016 feature “The Last of Us” won the Lion of the Future Prize at Venice. “Tlamess” (2019) was selected for the Directors’ Fortnight in Cannes.\n\n“Agora” explores a mysterious phenomenon in a remote Tunisian town where people who had gone missing for years suddenly return. These returnees stir tensions among families and the wider community, prompting local police inspector Fathi and his doctor friend Amine to investigate. The situation becomes increasingly strange and complex, particularly with the arrival of Omar, a police inspector from the capital, who attempts to unravel the mystery.\n\nThe “Agora” cast comprises of Neji Kanaweti (“Who Do I Belong To”); Bilel Slatnia (“Dachra”); Majd Mastoura (“Hedi”) and emerging Tunisian talent Sonia Zarg Ayouna.\n\nDUBAI: After walking the runway for the world’s leading luxury brands, French Algerian model Loli Bahia has unveiled her campaign with Italian label Gucci.\n\nBahia stars in the campaign for Gucci’s creative director Sabato De Sarno’s Fall Winter 2024 collection.\n\nThe rising French Algerian star is featured in the campaign alongside models Alaato Jazyper Michael and Jiahui Zhang.\n\n“Softly lit spaces create an authentic atmosphere in which to present a conversation between personalities and clothes. Loli, Alaato and Jiahui — each of them brings something of herself to the looks, enhancing De Sarno’s vision in continuous dialogue with real life, in search of freedom of interpretation, beyond all constraints,” the brand posted on Instagram alongside images from the campaign.\n\n“Grazie amore,” Bahia wrote on her account, which translates to thank you, my love, garnering a simple “best” in the comments section from none other than supermodel Bella Hadid.\n\n“Thank you to @sabatods and the entire team @gucci for adding me in this breathtaking campaign. An absolute pleasure being in these beautiful pieces and campaign,” Michael wrote.\n\nFor her part, Bahia cemented her relationship with luxury brand Louis Vuitton in February — just one example of the model’s many high-end campaigns.\n\nLouis Vuitton unveiled its campaign for the Spring/Summer 2024 collection, featuring the burgeoning 21-year-old star.\n\nIn the promotional clip, Bahia showcased the brand’s pieces accessorizing with a vibrant orange Dauphine bag crafted from supple leather.\n\nIt was not Bahia’s first collaboration with the brand.\n\nIn March 2023, she walked the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week.\n\nBahia is one of the most in-demand models in the industry, becoming a runway fixture in just a few months after a breakthrough Spring 2022 fashion season, where she walked in 65 shows.\n\nShe has walked for a host of prestigious labels, including Chanel, Tory Burch, Givenchy, Lanvin, Schiaparelli and Valentino.\n\nBahia also fronted campaigns for Saint Laurent, Tod’s, Isabel Marant, Courreges and Max Mara in addition to starring on the cover of Vogue Italia.\n\nLONDON: Apple is carving out quite the niche for itself when it comes to its original programming. These shows tend to have a big-name star, high production values, and a story that casts said star slightly against type in an idiosyncratic role that calls out for a later-career-defining performance. Just look at “The Morning Show,” “Severance”, “Shrinking”, “High Desert” and a dozen or so others.\n\n“Bad Monkey”, developed by “Scrubs” and “Ted Lasso” creator Bill Lawrence, shows there is plenty of life in that formula yet. This time round it’s the turn of Vince Vaughn to star as Andrew Yancy, a suspended police detective living in the Florida Keys who winds up embroiled in a murder case involving a missing arm, a crooked property developer and corruption in both Florida and the Bahamas. As a motormouth, world-weary cop, Vaughn delivers his best turn since “Swingers” and he’s ably backed by an ensemble cast that includes Natalie Martinez as a well-intentioned medical examiner, Michelle Monaghan as Yancy’s enigmatic sometime girlfriend, and Rob Delaney as slimy developer Christopher.\n\nSure, there’s a certain amount of disbelief suspension required — why does such a cynical washout as Yancy feel compelled to pursue the case he’s been taken off? How does a medical examiner from a neighboring county have such wide-ranging access to a murder case, and why are all these people zipping back and forth to the Bahamas with barely a bag inspection?\n\nBut you know what? It doesn’t matter. Like a lot of Apple’s series from the last few years, you’ll forgive a show like “Bad Monkey” a lot, because it represents an opportunity to see a charismatic lead in a role stuffed with potential, in a story with real zip and poise — that “Bad Monkey” is adapted from Carl Hiaasen’s 2013 novel of the same name certainly helps in that regard. That big budget has been well spent, too — “Bad Monkey” looks great and, if the first two episodes (available at launch) are anything to go by, it’s set to be another addition to the Apple hall of TV fame.\n\nDUBAI: US actress Jenna Ortega showcased jewelry from the Dubai-based brand Maison H Jewels at the photocall for her upcoming film “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” in Mexico this week.\n\nShe accessorized her black and beige dress with three rings. On her left hand, she wore a prominent ring featuring a large dark gemstone set in a chunky metal band. On her right hand, she wore two additional rings: One on her index finger with a smaller, geometric design, and another dark ring on her pinky finger with a minimalist style.\n\nThe dark rings are called the Black Diamond Skin Rings. This is not the first time Ortega has worn them. In June, she was spotted in paparazzi photos wearing the same black ring combination.\n\nFor her “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” photocall, Ortega chose a dress from Vivienne Westwood’s spring/summer 2009 ready-to-wear collection. The off-the-shoulder design featured a beige base with a sheer tulle overlay draped over the shoulders. The dress was decorated with black applique in swirling patterns, and the structured skirt ended above the knee.\n\nMaison H Jewels was founded by South African entrepreneurs who arrived in Dubai in 2001. The brand has established itself as a prominent name in the luxury jewelry market, known for creating fine diamond jewelry.\n\nThe brand has been worn by A-list celebrities including Bella Hadid, Jennifer Lopez, Nicole Scherzinger, Andra Day and Florence Pugh.\n\n“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” is the sequel to the 1988 cult classic “Beetlejuice.”\n\nThe horror-comedy film follows the Deetz family, spanning three generations, as they return to their home in Winter River following an unexpected family tragedy. Lydia Deetz, played by Winona Ryder, remains haunted by the mischievous demon Beetlejuice, portrayed by Michael Keaton. The plot thickens when Lydia’s rebellious teenage daughter, played by Ortega, stumbles on a mysterious portal to the afterlife. When Beetlejuice’s name is spoken three times, he gleefully reemerges to bring his signature brand of supernatural chaos.\n\nTim Burton, known for his dark humor and distinctive visual style, directs the film, with production led by Burton and Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment.\n\nThe movie is set to open in theaters in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 5.\n\nCHENNAI: Now on Amazon Prime Video, “One Fast Move” races into excitement the moment it opens with Wes Neal (KJ Apa of “Riverdale” fame) in an illegal motorbike run being taken down and jailed for six months. So begins the narrative of a young man who has being toying with motorcycles for an eternity till he decides to find his long lost father, Dean Miller (Eric Dane).\n\nThe film is directed with a touch of brilliance by Kelly Blatz, who also wrote it with a great twist at the end making the movie a captivating watch. There may not be much of a story, but that is adequately compensated for by arresting visuals (by cinematographer Luca Del Puppo) of pulse-pounding races and smart editing (by Seth Clark) that does not let a single dull moment creep into the narrative.\n\nAs a relief to the speeding wheels on the tracks, Blatz takes us into the personal journey of Neal. There are touching moments between the estranged father and son, whose own romance with the local girl, Camila, played by Maia Reficco, adds depth to the plot. Their chemistry glows, highlighted by the costume choices made for both characters.\n\nThe unique style of photography, capturing races at unbelievably diverse angles, will wow the viewer. Add in the first rate performances and the film is a treat.\n\nHowever, this is one rare work which I felt could have been slightly longer than its 107 minutes. A little more back story of characters like Wes and Camila could have really made the work feel more complete. The end seemed rather abrupt; a couple of more minutes there would have worked wonders. Although some parts of “One Fast Move” are predictable, it is a breathtaking work, especially with those stunning scenes captured with incredible precision."
