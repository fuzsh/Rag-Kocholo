        "text": "Hi everyone! I've been working with kids since I was 14 and would consider myself highly trained with any kids; due to the fact that my parents have in-home daycares in the Beaverton area. Working with kids for so many years, I have come to understand that children come into the world with a blank slate. The experiences, environment, adults, as well as surroundings are what shape them into who they become. I feel my responsibility as babysitter/nanny is to provide children with the best possible education, knowledge, and choices so they are able to grow to their maximum potential. I believe that children should be given the ability to become independent individuals by setting limits with positive discipline, praise, and encouragement. I enjoy being surrounded by children because of their imagination, innocence, and creativity"
