        "text": "Razan Holarant is a powerful defiler. He dwells in the underground tunnels beneath the ruins on the outskirts of the Fortress of the Shield.\n\nRazan willingly sacrificed his original family to gain eternal life. However, he brought the remnants of his deceased wife and children with him and laid them to rest in one of the tombs. He created several Broods of Blood, Flesh, and Dread in the area to keep him company and defend his territory. Razan tried for years to get into Adrasteia’s inner chamber, but never manged to until the deputies opened it (but had to flee due to their efforts).\n\nFor the foul murder of his family, Adrasteia sentenced him to death (or more properly: end of his undead existence) and asked the deputies to carry out her sentence.\n\nIn 1024 A.C., Razan turned a young woman, Estalla Mertvykh, into a defiler – gaining a new daughter that would be at his side forever. Those plans were, however, foiled by the deputies that destroyed them both in Adrasteia’s name.\n\nIn Battle[]\n\nRazan attacks twice, with a +10 to hit. The first attack is Bite dealing 3d6+4 necrotic damage and requiring a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being Drained. His second attack is Rapier dealing 1d8+7 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. He can also use Misty Form to move without suffering opportunity attacks and to move further than usual.\n\nHe has 3 legendary actions, which he can use 2 of to cast Slow (Wisdom saving throw of DC 10 to avoid being slowed), 1 of to cast Dark Veil (all non-defiler creatures have disadvantage on their attacks), 1 of to cast Dark Fealty to drain 10 hit points (technically 20 hit points but their resistance to necrotic damage halves the drain) from a Brood of Flesh, Blood, or Dread, or 1 of to use his Bite attack.\n\nHe has +10 to Dexterity saving throws, +4 to Constitution saving throws, and +7 to Wisdom saving throws. He also has Regeneration which makes him regain 10 hit points if he is unlit at the beginning of his turn, but which turns into Light Hypersensitive (disadvantage on attack rolls, and Dexterity and Wisdom saving throws) if he is in bright light, but unlike Brood-type enemies he doesn't take damage from it.\n\nConnected quests[]"
