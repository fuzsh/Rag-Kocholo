        "text": "Ever since she was a child, Razan Alazzouni has been drawn to all things related to art, and always running parallel to her passion for art was her love of fashion. The Saudi born and raised designer, known for her hand-beaded creations, signature florals and sculptural shapes, is mostly inspired by women and their natural poise. With this focus, Alazzouni’s eponymous luxury fashion label works on giving women the means to highlight their femininity and gracefulness, as well as the elegance of their form.\n\nThe talented and innovative designer’s unique sculptural pieces draw heavily on her earlier influences. While studying at The School of Museum of Fine Arts and TUFTS University in Boston, Massachusetts, Alazzouni concentrated on sculpture, screen-printing, and papermaking. While her pieces with an artistic edge are composed, they also have playful touches and a whimsical quality, thanks to the soft, luxurious textures that allow for movement. By using materials like chiffon and silk, Alazzouni, who has created a number of wedding dresses for happy brides-to-be, as well as her own breathtaking gown for her marriage to Sulaiman Al Mukhaizeem, perfectly amps up that feminine energy. Plus, Alazzouni, who has named her mother as her style icon, makes sure there are influences of her cultural background via the embroidery. The designer is undoubtedly proud of her heritage.\n\n“Art to me is anything that can provoke an emotion. Fashion is the same; it’s creating things that I find beautiful. I love expressing myself through my clothing. Our clothes have elements that show it’s a very rich history, a very rich culture. I hope that we change people’s minds about what it is to be Saudi. Vision 2030 is helping that, it gives us such pride to have a ‘Made in Saudi Arabia’ label on our clothes,” Alazzouni said on a Saudi Vision 2030 TV commercial.\n\nAs a multi-faceted designer, Alazzouni has dreamt up kaftan, jewellery and shoe designs as well. Her endeavours include coming up with a limited-edition capsule of bridal shoes, a collaboration with Italian luxury shoe label Rene Caovilla."
