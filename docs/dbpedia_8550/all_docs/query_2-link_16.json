        "text": "Forced to flee the Syrian capital of Damascus to escape Assad's henchmen, Razan found herself in the rebel stronghold of Douma, where her safety was soon threatened once more. There, Razan resumed her fight for women's rights and for the development of civil society organizations. She denounced human rights violations, including any committed by radical Islamic rebels. The DW Investigative Team has analyzed eyewitness reports, interrogation records, and satellite images. What emerges is a clear picture that may not only help to resolve Razan's case, but it reveals a great deal about the Syrian revolution as a whole."
