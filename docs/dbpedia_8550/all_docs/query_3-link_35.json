I was living in Texas before I came here, and I’m going to share my best experiences in both places!\n\nMy best experience in Texas was when I received Homecoming Duchess, especially because we don’t have homecoming in our school in Kuwait. Also being able to experience the Mexican lifestyle and culture was amazing! I enjoyed going to South Padre Island on Christmas, even though it was really hot down there!\n\nSpending time with my friends was always so much fun. Every single thing we did will be a memory! I know that I have made lifelong friendships!\n\nLiving in New York was something else. It was so much fun! I spent most of my time with my family.

We went to a Yankees Game, and we also went to see Good Morning America Live!! It was unbelievable!\n\nSomething else I’m really excited about is the 5k Color Me Rad run that I am doing with my host mom! And of course PROM!!\n\nSomething I’m not looking forward to is leaving…"
