        "text": "Nothing screams FUN like a 16+ hour flight across the Atlantic- especially with a toddler in tow! Did I forget to mention, that the same flight will be just the two of you? Oh goody! No second adult to support you with all the extra luggage and baby gear that is a necessity for your flight. Or someone to assist in navigating through busy terminals that push your anxiety to another dimension. That’s what my last trip was like, and now that I’ve been through hell and back, let me help you avoid the same mistakes I’ve made so you can get through your trip and back without a hitch!\n\nSteps 1: Research the heck out of your travel destination.\n\nDoes your resort come with an exciting kids’ corner where you can leave the kids to play while you get a relaxing massage? Is the Airbnb you’re renting near all the family-friendly activities you have planned for your adventure? Will you have relatives in the city you are visiting that will allow you to leave the kids for a quick date night? These are just some questions you want to inquire about ahead of your trip to plan the logistics to your liking so that both parents AND kids get the most out of your vacation.\n\nStep 2: What to do before your flight.\n\nTime Management: If you are someone like me, who detests being late (especially to flights) be sure to arrive at your flight, no less than 2 hours before your flight leaves. This key step will help prepare your little one for their big flight. Another thing with time to consider is booking your flight around the time your child usually goes to sleep or has a long nap. This tip allows your child to run and play while you wait for boarding which uses a chunk of their energy leaving them ready for bed by the time the aircraft takes flight. Make sure they eat a filling meal before their flight and change/go potty before boarding so that way you can put them straight to sleep as soon as they get on their flight.\n\nStep 3: Where you sit will determine the rest of your flight.\n\nI have seen people switch out of their seats so fast when wedged between a sleep-deprived mother and a hyperactive child, so if you want to be strategic in “shooing” your fellow passengers and freeing up a taken seat, follow this crucial step.\n\nThe window seat looks like a comfortable spot, but it’s actually a trap. AVOID THE WINDOW SEAT AT ALL COSTS. You will be stuck in a large predicament when your little one needs to stretch their legs or has to go potty every two minutes and you can’t get out of your seat because the person sitting on the aisle seat has decided to take a nap.\n\nTo avoid this complication, sit on the aisle seat and your child in the middle, and most people will be talking to a flight attendant faster than you know it. Viola! A row to yourself, you’re welcome.\n\nStep 4: Fill your flight with entertainment for your child.\n\nAs a parent, you know what your child enjoys and what keeps them preoccupied. Start making a list of activities that will be easy for you to take on your flight and rotate the activity every hour to ensure your LO (little one) is never bored. Some ideas can be; crayons and a coloring book of your child’s favorite character, putty to improve your child’s fine motor skills, or your child’s favorite books. Whatever you decide to bring, be courteous of passengers around you. No one wants to be on a long flight listing to the Baby Shark song for 10 hours straight. PLEASE DON’T BE THAT PARENT. I would skip toys that light up and make noise for that specific reason. Screen time is our only savior when in doubt, so be sure to download movies/shows before your flight. Keep it fun by mixing it up and your lo will not harass you or others passengers during your flight.\n\nStep 5: Watch for picky eaters.\n\nSnacks are a toddler’s best friend, and you better believe I brought an XXL ziplock bag for each of my son’s favorite snacks. Keep a mix of healthy and “unhealthy” snacks to give your child a variety for when they decide they really don’t like airplane food. (I wouldn’t blame them!) Some snacks I like to pack are trail mix, granola bars, sun chips, popcorn (for ages 4+), crackers, and goldfish.\n\nA good tip I picked up was to buy large packs of ziplock bags from Costco to compartmentalize everything. I was able to fill the smaller bags with a variety of snacks to fit into one LARGE snack bag and use other larger bags for toys, extra clothes, diapers, and miscellaneous things that I would need for the flight.\n\nProtip: be sure your child drinks plenty of liquids throughout the flight to avoid dehydration.\n\nStep 6: Pay attention to your child’s temperature.\n\nFlights can be very cold and the small blankets provided during the flight don’t do the job quite right sometimes. I suggest packing your child’s favorite blanket in your carry-on to allow your child to feel familiarized with something from home, as well as keep them comfortable throughout their voyage. Layering clothes is also a great tip if you want to avoid your child from catching a cold.\n\nMy final tip:\n\nThis applies if you travel with a stroller; Use every compartment available to help with your carry-on. Thankfully, I didn’t have to carry anything but a small backpack with my boarding pass and I.D. in it and I tucked my carry-on (with all my games/snacks/diaper essentials) under the stroller which helped a lot with navigating through the busy airport terminal.\n\nIf you follow all of these simple tips, I can guarantee an easy and fun-filled flight you will never forget with your new travel buddy. Let me know in the comments below if you’ve ever solo traveled with a child and what your experience was like! I would also love to hear the suggestions that helped you have a smooth family-friendly trip with your little one!\n\nThanks for reading, until next time!\n\n-R.M.\n\n29.760427 -95.369803\n\nWelcome back y’all! The first week of October is here so let me start by wishing you all a happy October! Time is flying by way too quickly and it’s hard to believe it’s almost the end of the year, my favorite. Let’s get our brain juices flowing by starting the morning with a Top 5 read!\n\nThis week’s article includes: The loss of a fallen hero that is close to home, why we need to cut ties with organizations that use animals for entertainment, is screen time or meat really that bad? And who SNRC is keeping tabs on for the Houston Rockets!\n\nThe purpose of this article is for you to create your own Top 5 and discuss it with your friends + family! Did any of my Top 5 make it on your list? Let’s find out!\n\n1. CNN — A Texas Deputy Who Made History Is Shot Dead In An Ambush During A Traffic Stop — This story broke my heart. Deputy Dhaliwal was a true American who was trying to bring everyone together in peace. He leaves behind 3 children and his wife. My condolences to the deputy and his family. I hope this doesn’t deter other Sikhs (or any other group in the community) from joining the police. It’s only when the police service truly represents the community it serves, there will be real policing of the people by the people.\n\n2. THE NEW YORK TIMES — TripAdvisor Ends Ticket Sales to Attractions That Breed or Buy Dolphins and Whales — I think this a bold move and I thank TripAdvisor for moving forward with this humane decision. I watched the film “Black Fish” a few years ago and the film was enough for me to change my perspective on animals in captivity. In the documentary, staff separated a calf from its mother and listening to the cries of the mother was enough to bring tears to my eyes and I can never forget it. These creatures and dolphins should be roaming the oceans, not confined to a small tank and made to perform for humans. Do you agree?\n\n3. MOTHERLY — Active Screen Time Has Real Benefits For Kids, Says New Study — Mothers! Rejoice! You’re not a bad mom for giving your child too much screen time and you’re not a bad mom for giving them no screen time. I agree with the author of this post; the research is worth considering. Screen time that engages kids with people is less harmful than just watching TV. What do you think?\n\n4. HOUSTON CHRONICLE — Meat’s Bad For You — No, It’s Not! How Experts See Different Things In The Data — I think it’s just like anything in life. Moderation and use at your own risk. Everyone has a different metabolism and system – what works for some doesn’t work for others. Just don’t over-indulge. Listen to your soul, it’ll tell you what’s right every time if you just listen. Does consuming meat leave you feeling recharged or defeated?\n\n5. HOUSTON PRESS — Five Rockets To Watch in the Preseason — The Rockets Added Size and Depth That Is One Thing For Sure! I think they did great this summer, especially compared to last year and with these exciting additions to the team, they are bound to skyrocket upwards. Which of these names are you keeping an eye out for in the preseason?\n\nStay tuned for next week’s Top 5. Discussion is healthy and productive when used correctly, sound off in the comments section below!\n\n-R.M.\n\nWelcome back to my second segment of Top 5! This week we’re recapping over what I saw on the “interweb” over the past week. Topics include: “fangirling” over one of SNRC’s favorite athletes, signs of restoration in humanity, and an interesting opinion piece on religion.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was originally supposed to be posted last Monday but unfortunately it got swept away with Tropical Storm Imelda while I was sipping virgin Mojitos off the Florida coast, contemplating life and learning how to be thankful (especially as I watched the waves crash and the sand tickle my toes.) It was a much-needed escape but now it’s time to get back to work. Expect a double post this week to make up for last week’s predicament. What is your favorite way to recharge before tackling the new work week ahead?\n\nJust a friendly reminder that the purpose of this challenge is for you to create your own Top 5 and discuss it with your friends + family! Did any of my Top 5 make it on your list? Let’s find out!\n\n1. ABC 13 — Picked up in 90 seconds: Newborn Surrendered In Baby Box. Can I just say, thank goodness! Every child safely surrendered is a blessing! Education and outreach must continue so no infant is ever left in a dangerous and perilous situation. Should every city in the US have a Baby Box?\n\n2. HOUSTON CHRONICLE — How Being Muslim At A Catholic School Has Strengthened My Faith And My Experience As An American [Opinion] — I can resonate with this insightful opinion piece, I especially loved this quote: “Sometimes, all it takes to improve understanding is for someone to ask a question and for someone like me to answer it.”\n\n3. WAMU 88.5 — Chef Jose Andres or Saint Jose Andres? A D.C.-based celebrity chef who runs a humanitarian relief nonprofit has served more than 100,000 free meals in the Bahamas. Chef Jose Andres is a true leader and role model. If I could give this man a Nobel Peace prize, I would. Which influential humanitarian do you feel deserves to be recognized?\n\n4. NPR — When School Safety Becomes School Surveillance — Questions: When did safety become synonymous with surveillance? What are your thoughts on this?\n\n5. VANITY FAIR — “You’re Gonna See a Lot of Swag”: James Harden on the New Houston Rockets and His Latest Sneaker — The historically prolific scorer, discusses what’s ahead and the SNR Team is stoked! There’s just something unique about watching an athlete start off as just a player, and expand his reach and grow his brand to something more than just the skillset we already enjoy watching on the big screen.\n\nStay tuned for next week’s top 5. Discussion is healthy and productive when used correctly, sound off in the comments section below!\n\n-R.M.\n\nHello all, it’s been a long time since I’ve written anything on WordPress!\n\nFor my new followers, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Razan! I’m an intern at a marketing firm and I’m writing these segments essentially for my job where I’ll be reposting them here.\n\nThis new segment rounds up the Top 5 things that caught my eye this week (last week)! Topics range from entertainment to politics to where you can get the best ribs in Space City, so what are you waiting for? Let’s jump right in!\n\nBy the end of this, the challenge to you is to make your own “Top 5” and talk about it with your friends + family! Did any of my Top 5 make it on your list? Let’s find out!\n\n1. TEXAS TRIBUNE — 820 New Texas Laws Go Into Effect In September. Some big motions are happening and it’s important to be well informed on something that just might affect you. Notable: Senate Bill 22. Defunding abortion providers is a mistake that will be detrimental to society, especially women of low income. This is a vital women’s health services. Lawmakers better be prepared for a strong voter turnout when they come up for re-election. Stay informed.\n\n2. HOUSTON CHRONICLE — Starting September 6th, A Select Number Of Startups Will Be Selected To Participate In The Inaugural Cohort Of Ion Smart Cities Accelerator! It will provide six months of pilot programs, which will allow the chosen companies to test their products aimed at solving problems that plague cities, like reducing traffic and congestion or improving flood mitigation in real-life situations. At SNR Creative, we love innovative ideas. Which startup are you rooting for?\n\n3. EATER HOUSTON — Blood Bro’s BBQ + Truth BBQ Is Coming For Your Money Killen’s! We’ve got two new show-stopper BBQ joints that just joined the Houston family and I can’t help but feel ecstatic they made the Eater Houston 16 Hottest Restaurants in September! Fall off the bone meat candy? Check. Juicy sausage you can’t put down? Check. And impressive sides to boot? Check. Both BBQ joints will have you singing the national anthem by the time you’re done with your meal. God bless America.\n\n4. KHOU 11 NEWS — Former Marine Arrested With Illegal Gun Suppressor. A man who served as a U.S. Marine was arrested after he was found with an unregistered gun suppressor/silencer, and paper on school shootings. This is very disturbing to me and a story I will definitely continue to keep a close eye on, especially in this political climate.\n\n5. NPR — A List Of 300 Book Recommendations That NPR Staff + Critics Loved In 2018. At SNR Creative, reading is fundamental and something we love to discuss. We even hold a book club every month for our office staff. What do you think of NPR’s list? Recognized any great reads you’d recommend a friend?\n\nThank you for sticking around on my first Top 5 — a weekly segment published every Monday. I hope you will stay tuned for next week! Feel free to send me suggestions on what to read or keep an eye out for!\n\n-R.M.\n\nIt feels like just yesterday was Omar’s first week at home. A week that was full of ups and some downs- from leaving the hospital with my newborn to receiving welcome gifts from friends to dealing with emotional stress to indulging in half my body weight in chocolates – that was one crazy week!\n\nI️ want to remember everything about this experience. As of late I’ve been very forgetful but if I️ document these moments, I️ know I️ will appreciate reading about them to my son Omar when he gets older.\n\nI️ am currently relaxing in bed on this lazy Monday while Omar takes a cat nap (his favorite hobby) beside me. Daddy is at the rig but he will be coming home soon. I️ send him pictures and videos of Omar every five minutes (not really, but it feels like it). The weather is beautiful and I’m really starting to appreciate this apartment. Comparing it to the one we moved out of on the 7th floor, This apartment feels peaceful and there is a sense of serenity here which I️ truly enjoy.\n\nOmar loves watching the bamboo trees swaying with the wind, watching from our balcony window at the lush greenery. Listening to the birds and rushing of leaves, I️ feel if I️ never had to leave this moment, I️ could stay here forever.\n\nI️ watch what he watches and try to process everything that has happened so far. It feels like a minute ago he was pulled out of me and was laying on my bare chest, with his hands curled to his face, I️ can’t forget his blue hands and little nails. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life and now that I️ have, I️ can’t imagine living without my son.\n\nI’m watching those same hands right now as they curl up to his face as he’s done so many times before. I️ can’t see the color of his fingers or the size of his nails. They’re tucked into his sleeves so we can keep his face scratch free, a face, that I️ love with every fiber of my body.\n\nI’m afraid to blink. I’m afraid this is all a dream. Sometimes I feel like my way of thinking won’t allow me to enjoy anything without overthinking which stresses me out. I can’t thank my husband enough for being my rock in the toughest moments of my life and I don’t know what I would do without him. I feel like when I get in these moods, I just need positivity to be a more solid presence in my life and I️ know Omar and my husband will help me be that way.\n\nTwo month ago I️ delivered Omar and this is his story so far. I reached the hospital at 10:00 PM for a social induction. I had my mother and my mother in law, my sister and my husband by my side as we sat in the room the nurse appointed us to. We nervously waited for what felt like a lifetime before a nurse came in and informed us that the procedure will be starting tomorrow. With that in mind I went straight to sleep to try to get my nerves relaxed and wait for what was yet to come. I awoke with nurses asking me how I was feeling and getting me prepped to break my water. Everything felt so unreal, I kept asking myself “Is this really happening?” A little bit after my water broke I began to feel the first waves of contractions. They started small like pinches in my gut and would last for a minute and start again after another minute or two. Before the pain could get any worse, the nurses began preparing me for my epidural. The most feared by all expecting mothers, I have to say mine went very smoothly alhamdulillah (thank God). They sat me up and gave me my first shot which I don’t remember feeling, it was a numbing shot for the epidural. Next came the epidural which felt really strange- as if someone twisted my spine for a second. Not too long after I was given the shot I felt numbness in my legs and the contraction pains stopped, which was such a relief. From there the doctor came to the room and began prepping for my delivery. I always laugh in my head thinking back to the memory of just watching her and her team casually strolling in and chatting like they were going to a spa and not about to pull A BABY OUT OF ME!\n\nYep, i’m still laughing.\n\nI will spare you all the gruesome details but Omar was pulled out after 45 minutes of pushing. The whooshing feeling when he was finally pulled out literally took my breath away. After that, it was like time stopped. People were talking and take videos, someone was crying, someone was sowing me up, someone was cooing at Omar, but nothing felt real except for him. I️ didn’t know his name at the time but I️ watched him in awe and I️ couldn’t care less about his name. His chest rose as he breathed in air for the first time. He made small crying sounds which I️ found to be unbelievable adorable. I️ felt at that moment that my life had just started and I️ wanted to do everything in my power to take care of him and give him the best life he could ever have.\n\nSomething really important new mothers should know is that everybody’s experience is different. Some had it easier and some unfortunately had it worse. One advice I tell all my friends is to try to comply to what the doctor wants. The doctor is the one after all with hundreds of hours of work under their belt and sometimes we complicate things for them when we start to pick and choose little details here and there, for example – if you want to monitor the baby’s heart or not or other things that are very important in course of your delivery.\n\nSince the delivery, we’ve had many amazing visitors, some of the closest people I️ knew growing up that I’ve been friends with for over 20 years. That’s a really long time and friendships like that are so hard to find and keep. They came with the cutest outfits for Omar and lots and lots of gorgeous flowers of every color and shape. My room was beautiful and it lifted my spirits with every visit I️ got. We also gots lots of sweets for mama to enjoy (shoutout to my girls for the chocolates!!). Everyone who came poured their love onto Omar and I️ couldn’t be happier. They made me feel normal again and not like something really serious just happened to me.\n\nThe one thing I can say about this experience is that woman will go through a lot but the most beautiful aspect of it is the mercy that God has on woman that for every pain she felt through delivery, it all goes away with one glance at your child. Everything melts away and mellows out until all you have is the excitement and the adventures that await you and your new bundle of joy.\n\nI want to give a huge shoutout for these amazing photos taken by my dear friend Shaimaa who is a true artist with her photography skills. All her work is beyond beautiful and she’s very reasonably priced so if you are in the Houston area, give her a shout!\n\nBe on the lookout for future baby posts and tips and tricks i’ve picked up along the way!\n\nIn all my years, I never thought I would be that girl. The mom of her friends, the first with a child, the one assigning babysitter shifts amongst my friends at twenty-four.\n\nHow surreal is it the way life just takes a turn onto a path you weren’t expecting, let alone ready for. I have a million and one thoughts running through my head at all times and adding a baby to the equation just simplifies matters more. (please tell me you can read through the sarcasm!)\n\nI guess that’s part of growing up. It only took me 9 months to accept the fact that this is happening and I know once I see what’s been brewing inside me, I’ll truly appreciate him. Yes you read that correctly, we are having a little boy, inshaAllah!! (God willing).\n\nI hope i’ll have the time to write more about my experiences in motherhood and let my friends and readers get to know what to expect when you’re expecting and how to avoid all the many mistakes I’m bound to make. I hope they can learn to laugh at the hard things and be easy on themselves throughout the whole process. Not just on your spouse, but it’s so important to be easy on yourself too. Taking care of your mental health is what truly makes this journey enjoyable. It’s easy to be upset when our expectations are too high and we think everything will go the way we want it to, but life does not work like that and you have to learn to manage everything one step at a time.\n\nThinking ahead will hurt you more than do you good. I know I stressed a lot throughout my pregnancy (SHOUT-OUT TO THE HUBBS FOR BEING SO PATIENT!) and I want to tell you that although it’s easier said than done, stop stressing. Everything is already written in God’s plan, you just have to enjoy the rest of the ride.\n\nThere’s so many amazing experiences I look forward to with my little man. For starters, I can’t wait to meet him! We expect he will be coming sometime on November 9th. Watch out Scorpios, here comes another one! ♏\n\nI’m excited to see all his firsts and dressing him up is going to be so fun! (RIP bank account!) I can’t wait to see him bonding with his father and the rest of his family and learning from them all sorts of things. I can’t wait to just have a piece of me and the one I love together as one whole being. I can’t wait for him to meet his aunts and uncle, his grandparents and his many aunties! I know he will bring so much goodness in my life and make me appreciate everything, changing me for the better and helping me grow as a person, inshaAllah.\n\nMy husband and I are down to two more names out of a list that started with 20. I know they say the name is picked out so I’m taking it easy and at the end of the day, they’re both great names and I know i’ll end up (hopefully) naming my second child after the second name.\n\nMy sister E, threw me the best baby shower EVER! Complete with an amazing cake, cute baby shower decor, music which HAD to include the word “baby” in it, and all of my closest girlfriends. I’m so honored to have her as part of my life and I’m so grateful for everyone who helped her plan this for me.\n\nThis cake was specially prepared by the Hummingbird Bakery in Richmond, Texas. It was so delicious and moist, I recommend this bakery to everyone I know! 🍰\n\nI am registered on Amazon if anyone would like to help us welcome our newest member in the family and if that’s too much, send a prayer our way! (Lord knows we’re going to need it!)\n\nLastly, I love reading about new moms so if you have any mom blogs you think I should follow, list them below in the comments section or if you have any great tips for a new mom, i’d love to hear about that too!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-r.m.\n\nIT’S THE MOST\n\nWONDERFUL TIME\n\nOF THE YEAR!\n\nIt’s that time of year y’all! When the temperature get’s just cold enough and you get to pull out all your cute coats to wear for a week and it’s so fun to dress up but what’s even more fun are the great deals and steals that are going on!\n\nIt Cosmetics Heavenly Luxe 6 Piece Brush Set $69.00\n\nI know these brushes are amazing because I work with them all the time at Ulta and the quality of these brushes are just phenomenal. I especially love the foundation brush because the product always looks great on my face after seconds of working it onto my skin and it leaves my face looking like i’m not overkilling it with foundation, which I love!\n\nLAURA GELLER Baked Gelato Swirl Illuminator – Gilded Honey $26.00\n\nEveryone needs at least one cult favourite in their wishlist and this year mine is the mesmerizing illuminator by Laura Geller. The shade gilded honey is just too beautiful to pass by and not swatch it.

It combines white jasmine with vanilla beans to make this irresistible scent that sends my head spinning with delight. Anyone who receives this gift would be so grateful (especially me!).\n\nArt Prints For the Home By Etsy\n\nWhat better way to gift someone something than with something that will fit with their home and something that they will always remember you by? I love art because it expresses and it comes in many forms! You can give them a beautifully framed quote or a large piece of abstract art, it all depends on the person you are giving the gift to. I would suggest only giving art to a close friend who you either know their personal taste or what their home needs. Here are some cute ideas: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nLevain Cookies $27.00\n\nThe best cookies from NY deserve to be on this list because who can resist in indulging in these mouthwatering cookies? The cookies are amazing and I will always be jealous of New Yorkers for this but if you enjoy these cookies as much as I do, you can still gift it to yourself or to a special friend or family member! The only downside is the steep price of shipping. With Levain, their cookies have a shelf life of a week so in order to maintain the freshness of the cookies, buyers outside of NY get a pricey shipping cost to ensure the cookies are not stuck in transit for more than 2-3 days. Other than that you can indulge in the assortment of irresistible flavors containing; Chocolate Chip Walnut, Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin and Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip.\n\nBaubleBar Crystal Choker $68.00\n\nChokers can dress an outfit up or keep it causal with the rest of your ensemble, the way you work it sets the feel you’re giving off. I adore crystal chokers and there are so many elegant pieces that can really elevate your style. Here are some of my other favourites: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTarte Maracuja Oil $48.00\n\nThere’s something magical that happens when I use anything by Tarte, especially the Maracuja Oil. Vegan face oil for a healthy, radiant complexion with no greasy feel. After 6 weeks 96% of women see an overall visible improvement in their skin which i’m totally all about!\n\nKate Spade Cameron Street Perforated Candace Satchel $398.00 now $198.00\n\nI’m loving the style of this bag in the shade Pink Bonnet! This gift is so feminine and composed and if pink is too girly for you, go for the Crisp Linen bag which is equally as nice. Plus it’s on sale!! *happy dance*\n\nDrybar “Slumber Party” Silk Pillowcase $45.00\n\nYou don’t have to be a genius to know that silk pillow cases do wonders to your hair but if you weren’t in the know, let me explain. Regardless of your hair type, the thin sheet that keeps your pillow clean is cotton, and cotton absorbs moisture while silk keeps it in, so when you lie on a silk or satin pillowcase, the oils from your hair are maintained rather than soaked up, leaving your hair nourished and not dry. Your hair will sit smoothly over the surface of the silk to prevent friction, which causes breakage, frizz and bedhead. So hop on the frizz free train for the best results with these silk sheets by Drybar!\n\nPlumeria Weekly Desk Planner $12.00\n\nKeep your life together with this lifesaver. Not only is it a chic office gift but it does the job right by keeping you organized throughout the rest of the week so that you can be relaxed and sipping on a pina colada by the end of Sunday and ready to take on the next week! The price point is great with having 52 sheets for that low price! Give this gift to the girl boss in your life. I also like this magnetic alternative by Our Heiday for $36.00.\n\nBarefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe $99.00\n\nThe gift for the homebody in your life deserves a luxurious robe to stay in all day if they choose to. A comfortable robe is one of the classic plush necessities and owning a luxurious soft robe is simply the best way to bring the pampering feeling home.\n\nBP. Tassel Velvet Crossbody Bag $39.00\n\nTwo things I love- tassels and velvet, combine the two and you’ve got the perfect winter bag. The chain-link strap over the shoulder adds a chic look to your outfit or you can simply tuck it inside when you need a party clutch. Both shades burgundy and green will flatter any outfit you choose.\n\nBaublebar Mini Gem Pinata Tassel Drops Duo $72.00 now $48.00\n\nSpeaking about my love for tassels, check out these beautiful earring that everyone is talking about!

A shining copper lattice lends geometric elegance to a streamlined eight-cup French press perfect for serving guests or gifting to your favorite coffee connoisseur.\n\nHigh Key Sunglasses X Desi Perkins $60.00\n\nDesigned in collaboration with YouTube makeup guru Desi Perkins, they will add a borrowed-from-the-boys cool to your sunny day ensembles.
