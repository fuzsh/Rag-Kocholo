        "text": "This fan-fiction article, Razan of Cintra, was written by Adalwulf of Aedirn. Please do not edit this fiction without the writer's permission.\n\nRazan of Cintra, \"The Bear of Cintra\", or simply Razan or Bear, was a well-known witcher of the northern realms, known School of the Bear witcher. He was an active Witcher before and following the Second Conjunction of Spheres.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life (1126-1131)[]\n\nRazan unlike many Witcher trainees had a bit of a childhood as he was brought to Kaer Morhen at the age of 5.\n\nTraining in Haern Caduch (1131-1141)[]\n\nRazan initially began his training at Kaer Morhen. During his training there Razan made a friend, with a pair of older trainees who would later graduate and become known as the Witchers Abbas of Zerrikania and Adalwulf of Aedirn. Though Razan was later sent off to train with the School of the Bear as part of an exchange program; Abbas, Adalwulf, and Razan promised to have each other's backs in the future on the path. During Razan's training at Haern Caduch, he stood out from the other trainee's at the top of his class.\n\nMutations[]\n\nThe age at which Razan underwent mutations was 7.\n\nRazan, was marked as having passable mutations and allowed to proceed in his conversion.\n\nRazan's Trials[]\n\nRazan's stay at Caern Haduch was anything but comfortable even for a Witcher's keep it was especially brutal as Haern Caduch was a difficult place to live. Due to the cold and snow of the mountains Razan and the other boys had to huddle up close to the hearth fires or sleep beneath many furs. If they didn't they would suffer frostbite or hypothermia. Razan also participated in the never-ending removal of snow from the fortress courtyard.\n\nThe Choice[]\n\nRazan was subjected to the Choice, eating the herbs and mushrooms alongside his training, his reaction to the experience was noted as being within the norm of expectations.\n\nTrial of the Grasses[]\n\nThe boys Razan was grouped with were given special teas before the trial began then he was exposed to a mixture of mutagens, virus cultures, and herbs intravenously, the pain was intense, bouts of madness and seizures wracked their bodies and minds in turns. Razan's few memories of his childhood along with those of his friends Abbas and Adalwulf were the only thing he could cling to during the experience that bolstered him during the seven days in which he took the Trial of the Grasses. In the end Razan was marked as having passed The Trial of the Grasses without any major problems. The some of the other boys were not as lucky.\n\nTrial of the Dreams[]\n\nAfter The Trial of the Grasses, Razan underwent the Trial of the Dreams to mutate his eyes. The mages induced psychodelic visions in the boy and recorded his ramblings, finding them to be with in the norms. He showed no issue with the procedure. He developed the amber cat's eyes usually attributed to the Witcher caste.\n\nRazan made a friend (1136)[]\n\nDuring a training exercise outside the keep. Razan now age 10 ran into Murnai a boy he knew from his childhood and the two fought side-by-side. Two decades later Razan would hear about his death during a bandit attack.\n\nTrial of the Mountains[]\n\nThe School of the Bear unlike the School of the Wolf required the Trial of the Mountains sending trainees up to venture to the peak of Mount Gorgon to retrieve a special runestone as proof of ascent. It was an especially brutal challenge as many boys freeze to death long before they find the summit. Razan succeeded however.\n\nTrial of the Forest Eyes and the Circle of Elements[]\n\nUnlike the School of the Wolf, the School of the Bear did not consider getting a medallion as the final step in becoming a Witcher, they combined the Trial of the Forest Eyes along with the ritual to energize their medallions. Razan was taken out into the mountainous woods of the Amell Mountains blindfolded and tied up, the only thing he was given was his medallion. He was told that he had until the next morning to perform a ritual at the Circle of Elements site in the Amell Mountains and to then return to the keep, and if he were late, he failed the trial. He was also warned if he were caught cheating, his instructor would hang him by his feet for a while. Coming to terms with his new sense, minus sight, Razan slowly but surely made his way to the site, performed the ritual and made it back to the keep. He greeted his instructor the next morning at the keep, the bear medallion vibrating slightly around his neck thus passing the Trial.\n\nTrial of the Stone Wall (1141)[]\n\nThe Bear School's final trial that consisted of three parts.\n\nFirst Test- Razan was told to acquire the ingredients for a potion called \"Full Moon\" the potion ingredients consisted of a bottle of Dwarven Spirit, a sprig of Wolf's Bane and bottle of Dark Essence. This test was designed to force the trainee into using brute force/intimidation to acquire Dwarven Spirit from merchants or store owners seeing as how no currency would be given upon start of the trial, secondly the ingredient known as Wolf's Bane would be also acquired by delving into hazardous caves and scouting the tunnels for the particular herb. This would also test the Witcher's ability to escape narrow paths and traverse rough ground, this helped more than realized as Witchers would traverse hostile monster lairs. The final ingredient needed would be Dark Essence, the Witcher would need to scour elven ruins to find and eliminate Nightwraiths for the ingredient. The first test would push the limits of the Witcher, showing the trainees that their profession and life wouldn't be so cut and dry.\n\nSecond Test- After acquiring the ingredients, Razan brewed the ingrediants together to create the elixir known as Full Moon. When brewed and consumed, Full Moon gave the Witcher trainee a higher tolerance to damage. It also gave the user increased health and physically improved the strength and mass of the Witcher trainee, after being consumed the Witcher trainee would unexpectedly fistfight a bear. This challenge was more symbolic than necessary, it showed that the school of the bear favored symbolic training and brute force rather than etiquette challenges and puzzles like the other Witcher schools. The trainee would fight the bear unarmed and with no protection whatsoever, other than the potion that they had consumed. After defeating the bear, the trainee would be given back their gear and would have to take on a contract to finally cement their place amongst the cat eyed monster hunters.\n\nFinal Test- For the final test, the Witcher trainees would need to find a moderately challenging monster contract to cement their place in the Witcher guild. Upon completion of the previous test, another Witcher would pass the trainee a list of optional targets to hunt and slay. This would set the trainee on a path to becoming fully fledged Witcher, the monster list would contain two difficult monsters that needed to be slain, also the trainee would need to take a trophy from the monster corpse to pass the trial. The first monster was a Wyvern, Wyverns are great flying reptiles with snake like necks and long tails that end in a venomous trident. Swooping down from the sky, they easily snatch their prey and carry it off to their nest. And they do not much care if it is a sheep or a man. The other monster would be the water hag, like the drowners and swamp bints with whom they often share hunting grounds, well near shallow streams, rivers, and wetlands. Though bulky, they are excellent swimmers. They can even swim through thick mud with astonishing agility, surfacing beside their victims to attack them with their sickle-shaped claws. After eliminating one of these and recovering the trophy, the Witcher trainee would bring it back to the Bear School and be automatically promoted to a Witcher. Being given a new silver sword and the appropriate bear armor, the newly promoted Witcher would go on the path and bring their monster hunting experience to The Continent.\n\nGraduation (1141)[]\n\nMarch 1141. Razan graduated with full honors. Thus he officially became a witcher of the School of the Bear . And in that same month, he would leave the school along with his other fellow graduates to start his first year in The Path.\n\nRazan travels with Omdal the bard (1148)[]\n\nJuly 11th. Razan meets the elven bard Omdal of Dol Blathanna and became friends while the two traveled together before parting ways.\n\nRazan frees a peasant woman of a curse (1152)[]\n\nRazan happens upon a peasant woman named Taeka who is suffering from a curse where whatever she eats turn to ash in her mouth but she cannot starve. After having her properly atone for her inaction, the curse faded completely. Due to his youthful appearance, Taeka does not suspect Razan of being acquainted with her lost brother Adalwulf, nor does Razan come to realize that Taeka is the older sister of his friend, though he does mentally note a passing resemblance.\n\nRazan made an enemy (1161)[]\n\nFebruary 19th. A female mercenary by the name of 'Ceaka of the West' slandered Razan during his time in a village. Ceaka would hold a grudge but died six decades later, in ironically, a monster attack.\n\nMarch 31st. Razan finds a lover Ido, who sees past his mutations and emotional desensitization. The relationship lasted a few months.\n\nSaved by Eishe of Vicovaro (1166)[]\n\nDuring a trek south down into the lands of Nilfgaard, Razan is saved from being executed by Eishe of Vicovaro, privately she asks Razan about his fellow witcher and friend Adalwulf of Aedirn.\n\nRazan is imprisoned (1171-1173)[]\n\nAs has happened to Witcher's before him, Razan ended up imprisoned by zealous villagers on an accusation. He spent the next two years in Deireadh prison for the supposed kidnapping and murder of a child. A sadly typical accusation towards Witchers. Razan made friends with an elven priestess during his time in prison. Razan was released when his dear friend and fellow Witcher Adalwulf of Aedirn locates the child's body and presents the child's real killer a Cemetaur who had taken resident in the local graveyard. Razan was released by visibly shaken guards who quickly and quietly apologized for his poor treatment. Adalwulf greeted Razan at the gates with all his effects and a horse.\n\nCommission in Skellige (1180)[]\n\nJuly 8th. Razan had a turn of good luck finding a good paying contract on the Skellige Isles. Despite most Witchers having trouble having trouble affording even affording their alchemy ingredients and repairs to their gear, Razan did that and actually managed to put coin into a legitimate savings account at the Cianfanelli Bank.\n\nTravelling with Adalwulf of Aedirn (1189)[]\n\nRazan's path crosses with Adalwulf and the two journey together for awhile. Razan shared some Witcher knowledge with Adalwulf, Razan shared his recipe of the Killer Whale potion with Adalwulf for his recipe of the Necrophage Oil. The two Witchers spent some time at an inn copying each others diagram and then afterwards drinking together.\n\nRazan makes an ally (1192)[]\n\nWhile on a carriage ride escorting a noble for a contract, Razan fought side-by-side with Brirvone of Ban Ard during an ambush by bandits. Razan parted on quite good terms with the mage.\n\nHunt in a ruin (1204)[]\n\nWhile hunting a monster through an old elven ruin, Razan finds a dwarven cloak on the body of a tomb explorer.\n\nRazan finds a mentor and gains a child of surprise (1222)[]\n\nRazan is approached by a teacher who offers his services to teach Razan to be better able to teach future Witchers through teaching methods. Razan found it to be a strange experience but went along with the man, until they parted ways. Razan also acquired a contact to clear an ancient Skelligen necropolis on the island of Spikeroog of a pair of Alghouls, citing the Law of Surprise as his expected reward, not expecting to get much maybe a new sword. That day returning with the Witcher, the man's middle son Jag surprised them from a tree, and so the man honored the agreement and Razan promised to return for the boy in three years time.\n\nWitcher Tournament ( 1210s - 1220s )[]\n\nRazan like all the Bear Witcher was not present during the Witcher Tournament due to his school not being invited.\n\nTravelling with Dragon of Skellige (1224)[]\n\nRazan's path crosses with the witcher known as the Dragon of Skellige and the two journey together for awhile. Razan shared some Witcher knowledge with Dragon, Razan shared his recipe of the Beast Oil with Dragon for his recipe of the Werewolf Decoction. The two Witchers spent some time at an inn copying each others diagram and then afterwards drinking together.\n\nRazan escorts two children to Haern Caduch (1226)[]\n\nRazan returned to Spikeroog to claim Jag an Brokvar which happened without incident, in Redania along the way to Haern Caduch Razan received a contract for a Forktail, for a worthy reward to be decided later. Razan completed the contract without incident and the contract issuer Lord Hunter noticing Jag journeying with Razan so he promised his eldest son and heir Sustor to the witcher along with a pouch of coin. Razan made his way to Haern Caduch without incident taking three weeks to make the journey.\n\nRock Troll Hunt (1233)[]\n\nA contract was put out on two rock trolls, though they initially attacked Razan. After taking a troll fist to the face and brushing it off, the Witcher managed to talk the pair down enough to find out they were mostly harmless as is the case with some rock trolls, Razan then had the trolls move further into their cave system and told his employer that he had killed them but that the corpses would attract worse monsters and to avoid the area in the future.\n\nRazan suffers an injury (1252)[]\n\nDuring a conflict a marksman's shoots Razan in the left bicep with a barbed arrowhead, which is still lodged in his muscle. The injury causes him pain whenever he tries strenuous lifting.\n\nRazan is knighted by Queen Calanthe (1261)[]\n\nRazan participated in one of Queen Calanthe's battles, and was knighted for his valor. Gaining the title of 'The Bear of Cintra'. His coat of arms was a light blue heater shield with the three rampaging golden lions of Cintra on the front and a single large vertical stripe of red to represent his school.\n\nFirst Northern War (1262 - 1263)[]\n\nTBA\n\nGriffin Hunt (1264)[]\n\nRazan ends up hunting a pair of Griffins in a hamlet for contract.

He swaps stories with his old friend and regales the youngsters and other Witchers with tales of his time down the Path.\n\nHaak Invasion of the Northern Kingdoms ( 1350 )[]\n\nTBA\n\nSecond Conjunction of the Spheres (1358)[]\n\nTBA\n\nDeath[]\n\nRazan dies hunting a Vukodlak (1567)[]\n\nRazan now old and grey had effectively retired from witchering, only on occasion taking a contract here and there.\n\nThe old bear had retired taking on the job of a Draper, effectively an alcohol merchant with a few other witcher backed businesses when he heard about the contract, a Crypnarian.\n\nWanting to have something to brag to his oldest friend Adalwulf of Aedirn who had taken on three Mula throughout his earlier career seeing how the Crypnarian was a cousin species to the Mula, Razan thought he it would make a comparable achievement to his oldest friend's and would make a fine boast when they would meet for their yearly ritual at Burov Mylne of swapping alcohol and stories, as such Razan decided to take on the vampire and contacted the contractor.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nIdo {Separated}\n\nFriends[]\n\nElf (Aen Seidhe)\n\nOmdal [Bard]\n\nHumans\n\nMurnai [Peasant] {Deceased}\n\nMages\n\nBrirvone of Ban Ard [Mage]\n\nEishe of Vicovaro [Mage]\n\nWitchers\n\nAbbas of Zerrikania (Friend) [Witcher]\n\nAdalwulf of Aedirn (Best Friend) [Witcher]\n\nDragon of Skellige [Witcher]\n\nSustor of Redania (Foster son and subordinate) [Witcher]\n\nJag Laittatrson (Foster son and subordinate) [Witcher]\n\nKnown enemies[]\n\nCeaka of the West [Mercenary] {Deceased}\n\nWitch Hunters\n\nBandits\n\nChurch of the Eternal Fire\n\nFallen Knights\n\nRelatives[]\n\nSustor of Redania (Adopted son and subordinate) [Witcher]\n\nJag Laittatrson (Adopted son and subordinate) [Witcher]\n\nPedro Esparza (Adopted nephew) [Witcher]\n\nPets[]\n\nTBA\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nAs a child Razan was the smallest of his troop which caused a majority of the boys to try to pick on him, but he made some true friends during his training as well leading to a life-long bond with his best friend, Adalwulf of Aedirn.\n\nCharacterized by his practical thinking and straight-forward personality. Razan was unflinching in the face of emotional matters, but would show manners in situations which required them. He always did what he felt was right for the situation.\n\nHe was often easygoing with strangers until given a reason not to, this lead to him getting along well with Skelligers. Courageously loyal and close to his friends and allies in his own way. Rational at times and dangerous when his anger was unleashed. He was very proud of his foster sons Jag and Sustor, as well as close to his friends and fellow Witchers Abbas of Zerrikania and Adalwulf of Aedirn.\n\nStanding 5' 10\" tall, this fair skinned man has a depressed feel about him. A particularly notable feature is his persistent sweet smell, and he has a faint scar on his back which he always to hide from view.\n\nHe has a narrow face, a pointed nose, narrow lips, and his amber eyes are large.\n\nHe has narrow shoulders, toned arms, a long muscular torso with a well-defined waist, bony hips, and long toned legs. His left biceps has a scar with an embedded barbed arrowhead in it.\n\nReligious beliefs and thoughts on Religion[]\n\nOrganized Churches\n\nThe Eternal Fire: Razan has never liked the Church of the Eternal Fire and his sentiment towards them has only gotten worse since they gained more power.\n\nKreve: Razan is respectful of the religion and they of him, the priests view Razan not as an abomination but as a champion of men like they do other Witchers, the priesthood has not forgotten the reason Witchers were made nor who made them and at what cost.\n\nThe Great Sun: Razan finds the zeal of the religion of the Great Sun to be abnormal but he respects that for the most part it looks after its people.\n\nMelitele: Razan has utmost respect for the Cult of Melitele as he has been healed many times at the hands of its priestesses.\n\nProphet Lebioda: Razan views this religion with some scrutiny, as he obviously views the prophet as an idiot for preaching at a dragon and getting eaten, but has also seen the good it has done for the general populace that practices it.\n\nOld Gods\n\nDana Meadbh: Razan wonders about the existence of this being, but tends to just think about her as a make-believe agriculture goddess.\n\nEpona: Razan does not know much about this 'horse goddess'.\n\nFreya: Razan, because of his time in Skellige shows respect to religious figures as long as they are not hostile to him. Treats priestesses of Freya with the utmost respect.\n\nLilvani: Razan knows nothing of this goddess as she is rarely spoken of outside her few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nMorrigan: Razan knows nothing of this goddess as she is rarely spoken of outside her few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nNehaleni: Razan knows nothing of this goddess as she is rarely spoken of outside her few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nVeyopatis: Razan knows nothing of this god as he is rarely spoken of outside his few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nDark Cults\n\nCoram Agh Tera: Razan knows nothing of this god as he is rarely spoken of outside his few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nSvalblod: Razan knows nothing of this god as he is rarely spoken of outside his few remaining faithful who Razan has never met.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nTrained Abilities\n\nAxemanship\n\nBomb-making\n\nCrossbowmanship: While it wasn't a weapon he was originally trained in, Razan adapted to the use of crossbows to hunt monsters. He used his enhanced senses to make highly accurate shots like at a distance or in pitch darkness.\n\nExpert Hand to Hand Combatant: Like other witchers, Razan learned to protect himself without his swords, able to defeat multiple armed opponents while being unarmed. His enhanced strength and knowledge of both humanoid and monster anatomy allows Razan a better chance unarmed than most people, able to shatter humanoid bones and use monstrous momentum against large monsters to throw them to the ground.\n\nGwent\n\nSwordsmanship\n\nLike most Bears, Razan was thoroughly trained in fencing. He has learned multiple sword-fighting styles during his lifetime.\n\nThe Temerian Devil (Wolf School Style) *Knows a little bit*\n\nThe Veien Til Forsvareren (Bear School Style)\n\nWitcher mutations\n\nSterility\n\nCat-like eyes that grant very acute night-vision - witchers can constrict their pupils to see in blinding light or open them to see in near pitch darkness. This night-vision can be further enhanced with the cat potion, but in general, it is good enough by itself to not require further enhancement. Their entire sensory system is overall enhanced, allowing them to identify the species of animal from the scent of their blood, and detect nearby beings even when out of sight.\n\nWitchers possess a disease resistance that borders on absolute immunity. This tremendous resistance to disease (which functions in most cases as complete immunity) and a boosted immune system, allowing them to consume large quantities of potions that could prove easily deadly if consumed even in small amounts by a normal man.\n\nWitchers possess a enhanced peak human condition brought about by training and mutations which results in exceptionally enhanced strength, speed, reflexes, and endurance, far beyond any normal or well-trained human, that allows them to swiftly end fights with minimal effort, and perform physical feats non-witchers couldn't hope to match. A witcher's physical skills alone are sufficient to defeat most monsters single-handedly if combined with extensive training and proper weaponry, whereas regular men could only hope to accomplish this in large groups. Witchers have also been shown to shrug off hits that would normally render normal men unconscious. Additionally, they have been known to survive the strikes of powerful monsters such as giants, or other beings possessing herculean strength, that would otherwise kill others with a single blow. Its generally thought a witcher is 10x stronger than a normal man.\n\nHaving the ability to perform simple yet incredibly versatile simple magic in the form of signs. They also develop a sixth sense that allows them to \"feel\" things around them, be it items of importance or people's immediate intentions. This explains their uncanny ability to track and hunt people and monsters.\n\nWitchers' possess a Regenerative Healing Factor usually granting quick(er) recovery from injuries. While not instant healing a witcher's healing time is highly unusual taking a fraction of the time to heal as well as surviving more deadly wounds possible. For example when slashed in the neck by a Striga's talons the famed witcher Geralt of Rivia it only took him a few days to heal before he was back on The Path.\n\nWitchers' possess the ability to receive mutagenic materials from monsters and process it into their being through witcher decoctions. This allows a Witcher to take on traits and the improved conditions of the monster, this is a incredibly dangerous process so a witcher can only handle one or two decoctions at a time, as a inbred safety precaution if a witcher already has two decoctions in their system and takes a third one, the oldest decoction's effects are overwritten.\n\nIt is unknown if a witcher has semi-immortality or a life extension as no known witcher has died of natural causes but witchers have incredibly long lifespans and prolonged youth. While each witcher is different, a witcher's known life expectancy is varied as they usually died in battle.\n\nExtra Mutations\n\nEnhanced durability: Because he was converted at Haern Caduch, Razan was given the extra mutation of the Bears which makes him a bit larger and more damage resistant but slower than other schools. Able to take a punch to the face from a rock troll and it doing nothing but mildly annoying the Witcher.\n\nMagic\n\nSigns: A simple form of combat magic that witchers use.\n\nAard: Aard is a simple magical sign used by witchers. The Aard sign is a simple magical sign used by witchers that directs a blast of telekinetic energy to stagger opponents, leaving them open for a subsequent attack. Aard can also blow out any existing fires, blast open poorly secured doors, or punch through cracked or damaged walls.\n\nAard Alternate Form- Sweep: Aard's alternate form turns it into a bubble of telekinetic energy that focuses around the witcher and expands outward with destructive force.\n\nIgni: The Igni sign is one of five simple magical signs used by witchers and causes a burst of fire that can repel and ignite opponents, as well as start fires.\n\nIgni Alternate Form- Firestream: Igni's alternate form turns the burst of fire into a sustained stream of sparks and flames.\n\nQuen: The Quen sign is a simple magical sign used by witchers that forms a protective field around the caster. Quen's basic ability is to cover a witcher in a basic shield that absorbs a limited amount of damage.\n\nQuen Alternate Form- Active Shield: Quen's alternate form creates a bubble of protective energy to form around the witcher it is stronger than the original form but is more draining on the witcher and requires them to remain in place.\n\nYrden: The Yrden sign is a simple magical sign used by witchers that forms a circular, magical trap. The trap triggers a certain number of times when traversed by a foe, causing knock back, damage, and a chance of inflicting ailments on its targets Most foes that wander into the ring are significantly slowed, though some monsters are unaffected by it. Yrden is one of the witchers best tools for controlling multiple enemies in melee range. It's also particularly valuable for witchers when up against noonwraiths and nightwraiths, who remain incorporeal most of the time unless caught within a Yrden circle.\n\nYrden Alternate Form- Magic Trap: Yrden's alternate form creates a stationary glyph of magical energy that strikes at and slows down hostile forces within a certain radius, as well as destroys and projectiles that happen to pass through that radius. Multiple Magic Traps can be placed down at once by experienced witchers.\n\nAxii: The Axii sign can charm an opponent's mind to stun them, temporarily eliminating them from combat.
