        "text": "N.Ramkumar\n\nA brief history of the Vellalas who were the main driving force behind the propagation of Dravidian languages and culture, is dealt with here. I present here the unknown or lesser known parts of Vellala history. History does not mean life story of kings only; it very well encompasses the life events of a community too. Numerically their presence is small but their impact on the Dravidian polity of Tamilakam, Kerala and Sri Lanka is immeasurably immense. Among the ancient Tamils, there were no castes. However it is understood that the Tamil society comprised of many tribes–clusters of people with a common lineage and cultural heritage– living together in a community. With the advent of the Aryans in the Tamil country, the doctrine of chaturvarna, accentuated by the later Manusmriti, raised its ugly head. It took a long period to bring the Dravidian-language-speaking communities under the spell of caste system. For the earliest records of South India we have the Sangam literature of Tamil country; there was no evidence of caste and the castes we have now were not represented in the land. Many castes were born out of tribes. Many Vellala castes were born out of the pan-Vellala tribe. The origin of the Vellalas is to be traced to the Indus Valley Civilization [IVC]. Our familiarity with the Indus Valley Civilization starts and ends with the names of cities like Harappa and Mohen-jo-Daro. However the earliest part of the IVC, had its beginning in the place known as Mehrgarh, located in the Baluchistan Province of Pakistan where the earliest phase of farming and pasturing took its birth. The origin and growth of civilization in the Mehrgarh is referred to as Regionalization Era [6000 BCE- 3300 BCE]. The people who created the marvel were the proto-Dravidians and who were widespread from the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle-East up to the Bengal region in India. It is widely perceived that Dravidians antedate the Semites in the Middle-East.\n\nCaldwell, Allchin and Fairservis–they all claim that Dravidians were there in the North-West of India before the arrival of the Aryans, at least by 5000 to 6000 years. Balakrishnan identifies tens of Tamil names like Korkai, Vanchi, Tondi, Seran wali, Kudal, Urai, Matrai, Kavri, Porni, Pandi, Maran, Karikalan, and Sola in the IVC zone of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Franklin Southworth in his Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia mentions about 18 place names ending with the Dravidian term ‘kot’ [kottai=fort] and 36 place names beginning with ‘kot’ in Pakistan, to confirm the presence of Dravidians there. Luca Cavalli Sforza is the first geneticist who postulated the dispersal of Dravidian-speaking farming communities from the Fertile Crescent region to the northwest of India. Another renowned geneticist Spencer Wells in his study of the movement of populations out of Africa, identifies the genetic marker M17 as signature of the Aryans and M172 as signature of the Dravidians who were predominantly the Velirs or Vellalas. Many of the people in the north having the genetic marker M172, were the Dravidians who switched to speaking Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nIravatam Mahadevan, an epigraphist and an authority on IVC is of the opinion that the rulers of IVC corresponds to the Velir of the Tamil country: “They seem to have been an extraordinarily gifted people with a special genius for social and political organization. They created not only the largest and the best organized civilization in the world during the Bronze Age; but also after the collapse of this civilization and their migration to the south. Some of the greatest kingdoms known to Indian history including the Andhra and all its successor kingdoms in the Deccan and the Chera, Chola, Pandya, Velir Kingdoms in the Tamil Country.” Tamil nikantus [thesaurus] enumerate the Chalukyas as Velirs while the northern chroniclers classify them as Rajputs. Divakaram nikantu speaks of “VeL pula arasar chaluku vendar”, [Chalukya rulers of VeLir country] and Pingalandai nikantu calls Chalukyas, as VeL or Velirs. Romila Thapar in her book “Recent Perspectives of Early Indian History” remarks that the word Velir in Tamil means what the word Raja in Sanskrit means, the king.\n\nAfter the decline of IVC in around 1900 BCE and after the arrival of the Aryans in around 1500 BCE, the IVC population [read Dravidians] started moving to the east and the south. The movement to the south is documented by the presence of Dravidian place names in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Franklin Southworth identifies nearly 800 Dravidian place names in Maharashtra with suffixes ‘vali’ and ‘oli’. Several such place names are found in Gujarat, Sindh, East and West Punjab, Western U.P. and Haryana. M. Raghava Iyengar in his book, “Velir Varalaru” enumerates some of the Tamil place names in Gujarat and Maharashtra. He says that Dr. Fleet citing ancient records proved that the historic Ellora was VeLur or Veluragam. In Solapur there is a place called Velapur and in Cutch there are many places by name Bela. In the Kopergaon taluk of Ahmednagar district there is a town by name Velapur and in Pune district there is a town named Velhe [velakam] which show the presence of Velirs there in the ancient past. The name of the town Belgaum is corruption of Vel Gram. Venad in Kerala was peopled and ruled by the Velirs. Tamil classic Purananooru refers to the Velir King Ay, as Ma Vel Ay [Great Velir Ay] and Thaer Vel Ay [Chariot-riding Velir Ay] who was ruling over Travancore region which later came to be known as Venad [Velir country]. Konkan was ruled by Velir King Nannan who is described as Nannan Velman, meaning Nannan, the honorable Velir [Akananooru-97]. They were none other than the Vellalas. They were undoubtedly the pioneers of agriculture in Tamil country and possessed vast tracts of agricultural land. Since, the prevalent social and economic status of a person depended highly on land possessed and agriculture, Vellalar enjoyed a high status. Scholars are more or less unanimous in their opinion that Velirs are the ancient forefathers of the Vellalar.\n\nSome archeologists suggest that some of the Dravidian migrants took the sea route from Dwaraka to land on Konkan coast. Historians identify the Velir chieftains of ancient Tamizhakam, which consists of present day Tamilnadu, Kerala and coastal districts of Karnataka, with the Vellalas. The West Coast was regarded as the region which has been branched off from the Tamils in the historic period and as “the land colonized by the Brahmins from Hindustan and governed by an aristocracy of that caste.” The Cheranadu extending from the south to Konkan is perceived as a part of the macro unit Tamizhakam. G.S. Ghurye, the sociologist and historian from Maharashtra considered the Velirs and the Vellalas as the real Tamils who were “non-Aryan North Indian immigrants.” There is also literary evidence to the migration of the Velirs. Kapilar in the Tamil Classic Purananooru [201] sings the praise of Velir Irunkovel. He says that he is the 49th ruler in the lineage of the clan that had migrated to the Tamil country from Dwaraka. Kapilar says that the Velirs rose from the pot of a sage and ruled over Tuvarai [Dwaraka] of the “soaring bronze walls,” which places the Velirs well before the Iron Age [c.1000 BCE]. The Aykudi copper plates specifically describe the Velir chief Vel Ay as belonging to the Vrshni clan, the clan to which Lord Krishna also belongs. The descendants of Irunkovel are assumed to have lived in 14 villages in Srivaikuntam taluk. They are popularly called Chevaii Pillaimar, their hereditary title is Irunkovel. Arumuganainar Pillai who wrote “Narkudi Velir Varalaru” suggests that some of them migrated to a part of the Chola country which later came to be known as “Irunkovel Nadu,” which comprises mainly Kodumbalur region.\n\nThe term Vrshni suggests a phallic-worshipping community, according to Jayant Gadkari, a historian. It is reminded here that the worship of Lingam was practiced by the people of Indus Civilization and ridiculed by the Aryans as “sisnadeva”, phallic god. They were the offshoots of Velirs of IVC, who moved to the west coast from Dwaraka in or around 1200 BCE and from there they moved to the Tamil country. They founded the three kingdoms of Tamil country. Subsequently they moved all over the Tamil country, Kerala and Sri Lanka. A genetic study carried out by the research students of Madras University also postulates that the Vellalas might have entered the South India at least 3000 to 5000 years before present. The most authentic proof for the Vellalas presence in the north-west is the linguistic evidence found in the Rig Veda. Some of the terms like palam-fruit, khalam-threshing field, aani-lynchpin, nanchil-plough, poo-flower etc found in the Rig Veda indicate the linguistic influence of the Velirs. The term nanchil for plough speaks for the farming community`s presence in IVC. The Rig Vedic Aryans were not food producers but food gatherers. They ate yava, barley, while the Indus Valley people were consuming wheat and rice.\n\nClarence Maloney, former Professor of Anthropology has stated that surplus of rice production in the riverine belts–Kaveri riverine system of the Cholas, Vaigai and Porunai riverine systems of the Pandiyas and Periyar riverine system of the Cheras–of early Tamil settlements gave rise to the three Tamil Kingdoms. The Chera prince Elango who composed Silappadikaram compared the Periyar River to an ornament on the chest of Vishnu. Renowned historian Champakalakshmy remarks that as for the Velirs, though they were only chiefs they had the distinction of being counted along with the Vendar, Kings (Pandiya, Chola & Chera). After an exhaustive analysis of the territories of the different Velir chiefs and the connections those have with megalithic sites, Champakalakshmy, states that the frequent references to the Velir and their strongholds as overflowing with rice and prosperity and their generosity to learned men would favour their identification with the founders of the earliest agrarian settlements in this region. Dr. K. Sivathamby states that except the Vellalas of the riverine region, all other castes were largely tribal then. A community that engages itself in food production will not rest producing food only. It by virtue of its pre-eminence in feeding people and creating wealth naturally aspires to protecting its interest and thus to rule over the society.\n\nEdgar Thurston has stated that “The Chera, Chola and Pandya kings and most of the petty chiefs of Tamilakam belonged to Vellala tribes.” He goes on to say that a “king of this tribe who ruled Orissa in the 11th and 12th centuries was known as the Gangavamsa” king. Karunakara Tondaiman who sacked Kalinga and Sri Lanka was a Pallava prince and the able general of Kulothunga Chola. Three inscriptions mention him as ‘Vellalan’. The Karunakara Pillaiyar temple in the Jaffna peninsula was built after him. The Tondaiman aaru (river) in Sri Lanka was also named after him. There were army commanders belonging to Vellala castes during the reign of the Cholas which fact is attested by names like Rajaraja Moovenda Velar, Neriyan Moovenda Velar, Vanlalanceri udaiyan Vellalan alias Vanakovaraiyan and Veerasozha Elango Velar found in inscriptions. The last two were commanders of Kulothunga Chola I. Kalippahai was a general of the Pallavas. Certain family names of Vellalas like Kavidi and Enadhi were titles conferred by kings on their commanders which indicate the martial tradition of the Vellalas. Ariyanatha Mudaliar and Chinnathambi Mudaliar were Dalawais of the Nayakkar kings of Madurai. A Saiva Vellala, from Panakudi near Thirunelveli, by name Maruthanayakam rose to become a great general of Nawab of Arcot who sided with the British. He subdued the famous Palayakkaran, Pulithevan of Nerkattumseval. He later on converted to Islam. Writing about the Vellalas, W. Francis remarks: “By general consent the first place in social esteem among the Tamil sudra castes is awarded to them.”\n\nThe census commissioner of Madras in 1891 noted that the caste system as explained by Manu was foreign to the Dravidians and before the introduction of the Brahmanical system the people of Dravidian origin belonged to tribal groups. Moreover, the line of division had nothing to do with profession and the link between caste and profession was entirely a non-Dravidian concept. In the South Indian society, there is no separate caste of rulers called Kshatriyas. Only the landowning Vellala families (for kings) and `maravar’ and `naicker’ families (for army personnel) were involved in the Kshatriya profession of ruling. A hiatus was deliberately developed in later times, between the king and the farming community of the Vellalas from among whom a ruler emerged, by the brahmins when they got up for the kings very decent genealogies which traced their ancestry to the sun, the moon or the fire. However matrimonial alliances continued. According to Srinivasa Aiyangar [Tamil Studies], it is the Karkattha Vellalas who rose to establish the mighty Chola dynasty. The Vellalas had close associations and held high positions of office with the three main Tamil dynasties—Chera, Chola and Pandya. Some of them even had marital relations; Ilamcetcenni, the Chola king known for his fleet of warships, married a Velir princess from Azhundur, and his son Karikal Chola also married a Velir princess from Nangur. The early Chera king Perumchotru Udiyan Cheralathan married Princess Venmal of Venad and Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan married Paduman Devi of Venad.\n\nThe Vellalas are strongly represented in Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Kerala. They are divided into several sub-castes like Tontaimantala Vellalas, Karkattha Vellalas, Saiva Vellalas, Nangudi Vellalas, Pandiya Vellalas, Tuluva Vellalas, Choliya Vellalas, Nanchilnattu Vellalas, Kongu Vellalas etc. depending either on the region of their origin or the actual place where they lived or live. More Brahmin than the Brahmins, the Saiva-Vellalas a sub-sect held themselves aloof from the castes below them and maintained strict vegetarianism. The members of the Vellala sub-division of Chetti are said to be pure Vellalas, who have taken the title of Vellan-Chetti. In ancient times, they had the prerogative of weighing the person of kings on occasion of the Tulabharam ceremony. They were, in fact, the trading class of the Tamil nation in the south. But, after the immigration of the Telugu Komatis who enjoyed Nayakkar patronage and other mercantile classes, the hereditary occupation of the Vellan-Chettis gradually declined, and consequently they were obliged to follow different professions. The renowned Saiva savant and poet Pattanattar is said to have belonged to this caste. Tuluva Vellalas are the immigrants from the Tulu country, a part of the modern district of South Canara. Mr. Nelson is of opinion that these are the original Vellalas, who were invited to Tondaimandalam after its conquest by the Chola King Adondai Chakravarti. They are now found in all the Tamil districts, but are most numerous in North and South Arcot and Chingleput districts. This colonization could have happened sometime before the Pallavas captured this country.\n\nThe Vellalas adopt the titles—Pillai and Mudaliar– by and large except the Kongu Vellalas who adopted the title of Gounders. It seems for some extraneous reason, many are enamored of the title Pillai. Thurston finds, “that the Vellalas of Tamil country and the Nayars of Travancore called themselves Pillai from very early times.” Among the Nairs, the Pillai title was possessed by those who enjoyed the royal privileges; the Thampi title was given to those who had blood relationship with the king and the Menons for the respectable families. The Telugu-speaking communities too such as Gavara uses Pilla as a title, whereas the Aaraama Dravidulu [Telugu Brahmin] community uses Chellapilla as surname. The same surname is used by many other castes like Kapu.\n\nAiyangar who worked under Harold Stuart and W. Francis in connection with the Madras Censuses of 1891 and 1901 has much in store to state that “no traces of the Tamil Kings are to be found at present in this country and it is highly probable that they should have merged in the pure Karkattha Vellala caste.” Durai. Jagannathan, professor of Tamil, quoting various literary sources says that the Vellalas were ruling an area comprising part of Dharmapuri District in Tamilnadu and the areas including Kolar, Chintamani and Chickballapur in Karnataka, sometime around 2nd century CE. In the distant past this territory was known as Kalapapu. The clan that ruled this territory is still called by the gotra name Kalappala. Sekkizhar [12th century] of Periya Puranam fame recounts that one Kootruvan Kalappala was ruling a part of Tondainadu from his capital at Kalandai. Sekkizhar`s brother was Pallavarayan Kalappala who was a minister to Chola King Kulothunga III. Meikandar, the author of Sivajnanabotham, himself was a Kalappala; his father`s name was Achuta Kalappala. P.T. Srinivasa Aiyangar in his work “The History of the Tamils” says that the three kings of Tamilakam sang in praise of the Kalappalas.\n\nGenerosity and honesty were regarded as the special attributes of the Vellalas, the agricultural landlords. The word Velanmai became a synonym for charity. Historians of Tamilakam such as V. Kanakasabhai, T N. Subramanian, N. Sivaraja Pillai, and P. T. Srinivasa Aiyangar rejected civilizing role of Aryan culture in Tamilakam. They rather regarded Aryanization as that which corrupted the original Tamil culture. P.T. Srinivasa Iyengar in his book, “Pre-Aryan Tamil Culture” emphatically states that “the Tamils were the most cultured people of India before the age of the rishis.” He further mentions “the fallacy of reasoning with which some read the influence of Aryan culture in every walk of life in the South” as deplorable. V. Kanakasabhai Pillai states that “the Tamils who inhabited the West Coast were separated from the rest of the country by high mountains in their speech from the main body of the Tamils.”\n\nAiyangar traces the meaning of the word Vellala to Velan as it occurs in the ancient Tamil inscriptions. He equates the term with Vel-lance-and Vellala means one who wields a Vel. The etymology of the word Vel in Tamil leads us to Velan, Lord Murugan, who wields a Vel. Hence the title Pillai-son, as Lord Murugan is a son of Lord Siva. It leads us to conclude that the Vellalas were a martial tribe, but note, not a violent tribe. The high sounding term Vellalas, rulers of the floods [river water] and ruler of lance indicate their association with power and administration. Another mode of calling them is Velalas, with dropping of a letter ‘l’ in English and change of letters and pronunciation in Tamil. This word is an amalgam of two words- VeL+Alal- that is, a leader who rules. These Velalas were the ruling clans hailing from the pan-Vellala communities.\n\nApart from the south, the Vellalas presence in the east too is acknowledged. According to Bijoy Chandra Majumdar, the Vaidyas of Bengal were actually the Vellalas who accompanied Rajendra Chola in his military expedition to the Gangetic plains of the east. They settled in the east and occupied the thrones of Bengal and Mithila. The Sena rulers of Bengal were the descendants of certain Vellala Senapati [General of an Army] who came with the invading army of the great Rajendra Chola and who stayed back in Bengal. The letter ‘V’ is normally replaced by ‘B’ in Bengali, hence they are called Bellala Sena and assumed to have hailed from Karnataka. Please note, until the time of the British, the southern India was known as Carnatic. The literary and other traditions, however, speak that Vellala Sena conquered Magadha and Mithila in Bihar. Edward Blunt in his book, Caste System of Northern India, says that Haihaya Rajputs of Chedi in the 11th century are supposed to be of Tamil or Hun origin. They are referred to as Chodas of Chola-Chalukya Empire by the Telugu historians. A.H. Bingley in his book, Handbook on Rajputs, remarks that the swarthy complexions and non-Aryan features of the Haihaya Rajput have led many authorities to the conclusion that they are Tamils. In fact these Haihaya Rajputs were the descendants of the Vellala commanders of King Rajendra Chola.\n\nAfter the decline of the Chola and Pandya Empires, the Vellalas found it difficult to reign; some of them migrated to Kerala and Sri Lanka. However a large exodus of Vellalas to Yazhpanam and Kerala took place during the regime of the Nayakkar Kings. After their entry in Yazhpanam, they as usual dominated the political, linguistic and agricultural spheres. They commanded such a respect and admiration that the Goyigama caste of the Sinhalese called themselves as Sinhala Vellalas. Arnold Wright writing on the 20th century Ceylon spoke very highly of the Vellalas of Yazhpanam [Sri Lanka]. He, of the ancient Vellalas, said that “The Vellalas are credited with utmost loyalty to the kings who belonged to the Vellalas caste themselves.” Most of the Vellalas of Yazhpanam [Sri Lanka] belong to Karkatthars. Si.Vai. Thamotharam Pillai, V.Kanakasabhai Pillai, Arumugha Navalar and many of the leaders of pre-LTTE era belonged to Karkatthars. Sri Lankan Mudalis of Jaffna has at least two or three clans from Thondaimandalam with Mudali surname. Irumarapum Thooya Thaninayaga Mudali from Seyyoor and Mannadukonda Mudali whose clan has been quoted even during famous poet Kambar’s time. The other clans may come under this section or under Sri Lankan Vellalar section.\n\nU.B. Nair has stated that ingenuity of the Brahmins demanded that the strength of Vellalas had to be weakened through hypergamous unions just as the Nayar community was initially weakened by the Namboodiris Connubium with the Nayar women. However, the Vellalas never succumbed to the designs of the Brahmins to enter into the family fold under the guise of a divinely inspired progenitor, so the Brahmins did not succeed in breaking up their social system. As family is the psychological agent of society and as it was kept outside the pale of Brahmin influence, the group did not succumb to Brahmanical social tradition. Nair then raises a query and answers it: “Another interesting poser now is that if the Vellalas were then so powerful and that their position was so widely recognized over all the three important Tamil Kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandya why is it that the Brahmins did not confer on them Kshatriyahood especially as many ruling chiefs at that epoch may have been Vellalas themselves? The fact is that the Brahmins did not confer on the Vellalas Kshatriyahood exactly in the same way as they did not regard the Nayars as Kshatriyas even after having penetrated the Nayar household and produced many prototypes of their own kind. For it is a fundamental principle of Brahmanical strategy that even in the extension of the Varna system they were careful not to extend the dimension of the upper castes under some unforeseen eventuality or circumstances.”\n\nIn stark contrast to the scenario that obtained in Kerala, the Vellalas of the Tamil country prided themselves on their lineage and refused to be subservient to the Brahmins. They were the first tribe to be aryanised in culture and religion; yet they did not forsake Tamil in favor of Sanskrit which aspect distinguishes them from the Brahmins who held aloft the flag of Sanskrit. As the Vellalas had scant respect for priestly functions, they yielded place to the Brahmins which act resulted in the overall supremacy of the Brahmins. In the matter of temple rituals the Brahmins adopted the Agamic rules of the Dravidians and Sanscritized them to make it a prerogative of theirs. The priestly privilege and the ascendancy of Sanskrit language in the rituals of Hinduism enabled the Brahmins to relegate the Vellalas to the second place from their primordial unique position they held since the development of ancient Tamil culture and literature. E.R. Leach in his book “Aspects of caste…” has this to say on Vellala-Brahmin relationship: “The deference that a Vellala customarily offers to a Brahmin is to his office as priest, rather than to his caste.” In the Tamil country, the attainment of Vellalahood and the Vellala-specific titles of Pillai and Mudaliar became a dream of every community. This aspect is evident in the popular saying that respectability and richness make Kallar, Maravar and the black Agamudaiyar, slowly the Vellalas. Many a community assumed the titles of Vellalas and posed as Vellalas which act renders the identity of the real Vellalas a bit difficult and hazy.\n\nThe migratory route of the Vellalas is variously described. I am not going into the merits of each one but record them. It is noted that the Vellalas of the Pandian kingdom were an immigrant community who were invited by the king himself to settle his land because of their expertise in agriculture. In this connection, Thurston cites a legend in his magnum opus, “The castes and tribes of southern India.” Once the Pandian kingdom was reeling under severe drought; for riddance from the drought and famine, people prayed to Bhumadevi, goddess of Earth. Hearing their pleas the goddess made a man with a plough appear tearing apart the earth. That man who taught the people the nuances of irrigation and agriculture was none other than the Vellala. The story highlights the fact that Vellalas invented the plough. The salient difference between the Vellalas and the Brahmins is the openness of the Vellalas; they did disseminate the knowledge of irrigation and agriculture they learnt from the goddess among the other Dravidian people. The Brahmins have always been secretive of their trade, priesthood; they never allow anyone to enter their domain. They made it possible by employing Sanskrit language in the performance of pujas and rituals. As Sanskrit had never been the language of the masses, it suited them well to stand apart from others.\n\nAt the time of the rule of Nayakkar kings in the Tamil country a new legend regarding the origin of the Vellalas did appear. It was recorded by Thurston. The motive behind the legend is a suspect. A legend fabricated to develop friction and enmity between the Tamil speaking communities did serve its purpose. The legend runs like this: Once lord Siva and his consort Parvati were enjoying themselves in their mountainous abode called Kailash. Suddenly Viswakarma, the chief builder of heaven and earth entered Kailash disrupting the carnal play of the god. Enraged by his uncivilized act of entering his domain without permission, Siva cursed him saying that a boy would come to earth on the bank of Ganga; he would nib his arrogance and subdue him. Nevertheless, Viswakarma vowed to kill the boy in one stroke. Saying this he came to the shore of the Ganga waiting for the appearance of the boy with unsheathed sword ready in his hand. At one place, the earth cleaved and a boy with a crown on his head was slowly emerging. Impatient at the total emergence of the boy, Viswakarma swished his sword that knocked off the crown of the boy instead of slicing his neck. His one stroke was over. Accepting defeat, he made his five kammalan (smiths) sons to be subservient to the Vellala boy. The gods named him protector of earth. As he had lost his crown, the Vellala boy was not entitled to rule. Kubera and Indra married their daughters to him. God Siva and Yama gave him a white bull each to plough the earth. Practicing agriculture, he became prosperous. His descendants were Vellal warus, which means those who plough with white bulls. In Tamil, the term Vellalas denotes those who control the floods (water). This myth, it is also said, was deployed by the Telugu rulers so as to exclude the Vellalas from claiming the thrones of Tamil kingdoms once again.\n\nThe Vellalas of the Telugu country are the Velamas. They went to the Telugu country with the invading Chola army and settled that country when the Cholas brought it under their rule. Even this day the Velamas are big feudal lords there. The Nayakkar rulers of Madurai were actually from the Velamas caste. This fact was borne out by R.E.Frykenberg who wrote about the role of Christians and Missionaries in the social life of the Tamils. In the Kannada territory, they were the Bellalas who ruled that country for several centuries. Mahadevan identifies the rulers of the kingdoms of Chalukyas, the Kadambas and the Hoysalas with the Vellalas. Aiyangar also points out that all the modern cultivating castes- the Bunts, the Nairs, the Telagas or the Velamas- were formerly martial tribes like the ancient Vellalas.\n\nThe Portuguese historian Faria F.Souza writing about the social divisions in the 17th century AD notes that the Vellalas are held in such esteem that the kings marry their daughters to the Vellalas saying that they are the public substance. Kings getting married to the daughters of any community may happen because of political alignments. However if the kings offer their daughters to Vellalas it means that the Vellalas belong to the royalty. If we take into consideration the views of Srinivasa Aiyangar on the role of Vellalas in the ancient Tamil country, it is very well in favor of the argument that the three kings namely the Cheras, the Cholas and the Pandyas were actually Vellalas. He declares that the Vellalas were pure Dravidians and that they were a military and dominant tribe. If we take the views of Mahadevan (who identifies the Vellalas as the rulers of Tamil territories) regarding the origins of Vellalas, it perfectly coincides with the views of Aiyangar.\n\nRisley while mentioning the good physical type of the Vellalas, places them above the Brahmins: “Next came the Vellalas, the great cultivate caste of the Tamil country with a mean nose index of 73.1. The Tamil Brahmins themselves belong indeed to a lower physical type; but their mean index of 76.7 has probably been affected by the inclusion in the group of some tribal priests who obtained recognition as Brahmins when their votaries insensibly became Hindus.” Compare Risley`s findings with what M. Srinivasa Aiyangar has to say about the Vellalas: “The Dravidian means the Vellalas and the Chetti castes who were more or less brown complexioned, fairly civilized, of good physique and of martial habits like the Semitic or Iranian tribe of Northwest Asia.” His words confirm the genetic origin of the Vellalas from the Fertile Crescent.\n\nNow let me bring into focus the religious personalities of the Vellalas. Who is Nammazhvar? C.T. Indra, a Vaishnavite scholar says that there were great devotees of Vishnu including the three primal Azhvars before Nammazhvar. But he is placed at the head of the Acharyas though he was a mystic hymnist and no preceptor. Nammazhvar was born to Kari and Udayanangai in Thirukkurugur, south of the Tamil country presumably in the seventh century. He was named ‘Satagopan’- (one who controlled while in the womb, the ‘Sata’ Vayu). Nammazhvar hailed from Vellala community. His marriage was also fixed with a Vellala girl from a town in Kerala. Appar [7th century] was born and brought up at Thiruvamur, in Thirumunaipadinadu, on the banks of the river Pennai. He was born in a Velala family to Puhalanar and Madiniyar. He embraced Jainism but was brought back to Saivism by his sister Tilakavati`s devotion to God Siva. Impressed with his hymns, people addressed him as Tirunavukkarasar, “King of tongue [words]”. He was called Appar by Sambandhar. From Chola period on, membership in the Tamil Saiva cult stabilized being composed predominantly of prosperous non-brahmin caste of Vellalas who ranked high in the regional caste hierarchy. Appar and many other Nayanmars were Vellalas.\n\nThe Siddhanta philosophers also came from the Vellala caste. Meikandar [13th century], a Vellala, authored Sivajnanabotham, a treatise on Saiva Siddhanta. The heads of Tamil Saiva madams [monasteries, called aadheenam in Tamil] Dharmapuram, Tiruppanandal, Tiruvaduthurai, Madurai and Kundrakudi which flourished in the 14th century and earlier have traditionally been Vellalas. Madurai aadheenam was claimed to have founded by Sambandhar [7th century] but headed by a Vellala since long. Tiruvaduthurai madam was established by Namasivayar [15th century] hailing from a Saiva Vellala family in Muvalur. Guru Gnanasambandar [16th century] founder of Dharmapuram Madam was born in Srivilliputtur in a Saiva Vellala family. Kumaraguruparar [17th century] born in Srivaikuntam was a Vellala. He composed many devotional hymns on Siva and founded a madam at Tiruppanandal and Kasi.\n\nThayumanavar, (1705–1742), pronounced Thayum-anavar, is one of the Vellala spiritual giants and philosophers. Saint Ramalinga Swamikal [1823-1874], popularly known as Vallalar hailed from Vellala community, near Chidambaram. His Tamil devotional hymns “Thiru Arutpa” transcend caste or creed barriers. H.A. Krishna Pillai [1827-1900], a poet from Thirunelveli, having converted to Christianity, rendered John Bunyan`s Pilgrim Progress in Tamil as Ratchanya Yatrigam. Mayuram Vedanayakam Pillai [1826-1889], a Christian, was a poet, a novelist and a Muncif by profession, who gave Tamil its first novel. The Great Vellala Yogi Sivarajayogi Ayya Swamikal [1814-1909] of Thiruvananthapuram was the Guru of Sree Narayana Guru, Chattampi Swamikal, Ayyankali and many others. He was the first and the greatest social reformer of Kerala, who did not get his due place in history. He was a yogi cum family man that Swamikal started “Panthibhojanam,” the concept of community feasts in Kerala to bring about equality of castes.\n\nWhen the British took over the administration of the Madras Presidency, more than 75 per cent of the recruits for the white collared jobs were drawn from Vellala community. It was only after the execution of Thanapathy Siva Subramania Pillai, an associate of Vira Pandya Kattabomma Nayak, the Palayakkaran of Panchalamkuruchi, the British changed their policy. The British adopted a deliberate policy of isolating the Vellalas. Madras District Gazetteers [1917] reported that Collector (C.1866) finding the Collector’s establishment practically monopolized by Vellalas applied for their transfer to other districts in favour of Brahmins. Change of loyalty led to their estrangement from the British and this accounted for their political setback. In the `later’ Chola period (9-13 century A.D.), the Vellalas had the ruling power over Nadu [villages] which were not given to the Brahmins as `Brahmadheya’ villages, Valanadu [a unit of district size] and Mandalam [comprising several Valanadu]. They carried titles such as veLan, araiyan, udaiyaan, aazhvaan, kizhavan etc. They were collecting the land taxes and implementing the government orders. When the Cholas regime ended in the 13th century, Vellalas ended as mere landlords. The Palayam system of Nayakkars took away all advantages that the Vellalas and Brahmins enjoyed till that time. Later when Southern parts of Tamilnadu came under the control of Nayakkar chieftains, the Vellalas worked under them. They maintained accounts in palayakaras offices, and hence they attained the title “kanakku pillays.”\n\nUntil the rule of the Cheras, Kerala was part of the Tamil kingdoms and hence migration of populations received little attention. With the demise of the Cheras, the land of the Malayalam broke into many smaller principalities. And again with the decline of the Chola rule, it drifted differently. So until then it is quite probable that migration of peoples across the borders has been going on ceaselessly without any difference in language. William Logan in Malabar Manual wrote that, “The Nayars were, if we may credit tradition, also Vellalas but of course most important and most consequential and most acceptable function was the protection duty” and on another occasion he says, “out of whom [Vellalas] the caste of Nayars seems to have been originally formed.” So as in Tamil country, in Kerala too the purely agriculture community of Nayars became a community of warriors; however with the fall of Tamil kingdoms, the Vellalas of Tamil country turned once again to agriculture. With the loss of regal power the Vellalas of Tamil country became the backbone of administration in Tamilnadu and Travancore.\n\nThe Bhagavathy temples of Kerala are all examples of ardhanarisvara concept in name. The great Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar maintains Adhi and Bhagavan as foremost gods. And a reversal of the names has taken place in the Chera country, Bhagavan+adhi= Bhagavathy. It is also revealing to know the deities of Guruvayur, Vaikom and Sabarimalai are affectionately called by the names Guruvayurappan, Vaikkatthappan and Ayyappan respectively. Malayalam term achan is not appended to them instead of Tamil appan. This speaks of the ancient connections these two lands had. The Vellalas of the Kerala territory take pride in that the Lord Ayyappan of Sabarimalai an adopted son of the King of Pandalam was Vellalakulajathan (lord belonging to Vellalas caste). This fact of Ayyappan`s lineage is brought out in Elavar sevam pattu. The royal house of Pandalam belonged to Vellalas whose ancestors migrated from the Pandian kingdom some 800 years ago. It is said that the name, Pandalam was derived from two Tamil words Pandu [ancient] and dalam [army or place], that is, Pandudalam which in course of time became Pandalam. Pandu here refers to Pandyas and it has no connection with Pandu of Pandavas.\n\nEdgar Thurston in his magnum opus ‘Castes and Tribes of Southern India’ refers to the migration of Vellalas to Kerala. He elaborates that in the Travancore province beside the Nanchil Vellalas there were two sections of Vellalas inhabiting the mountainous Thodupuzha taluk. These are Thenkanchi and Kumbakonam Vellalas; the former are known by the popular name of anjutikkar or the five hundreds and the latter are termed as munnutikkar or the three hundreds in reference to the number of families settled in Thodupuzha. It is obvious that by Thenkanchi, Thurston means Tenkasi of the Tirunelveli district. These two communities have their own temples built. Thurston reports that Padamangalam and Tamilpadam Nayars were not originally Nayars but immigrants from the Tamil country. Of these two, the Padamangalam Nayars were originally Nanchil Vellalas. Mannadiar, a caste counted as Nairs, is found mainly in the district of Palakkad. Some associate them with Kongu Vellalas among whom there is a clan called Mandradiar, a moniker of Mannadiar. However tradition speaks of them to have come from Trichy, Thanjavur and Madurai regions of Tamil Nadu. Their temple, Meenkulathikavu at Pallassena was built by Saiva Vellalas from Chidambaram who were forced to leave their town because of a famine.\n\nU.B. Nair states that the Vellalas were the protector class of the east coast. He states that tradition alludes to the advent of Vellalas into Malabar. He writes that 64 families of Karakattu Vellalas formed the Kiriyathil Nayar group. Just as Karkatthar is among the Vellalas, Kiriyathil is among the Nayars, the highest class. They enjoyed special privileges such as the right to partake food with Brahmins. It was an exceptionally high privilege in those times. Karkatthar Vellalas won distinction from the Pandya king for guarding the clouds and were apparently the ones brought in by Parasurama into Malabar. These Karakattu or Karkattha Vellalas were the founders of the great Chola Empire. However it is also stated that they came in to Malabar even before Parasurama, during Bhaskara Ravi Varma’s time [700 AD]. The earlier migrants in all probability might have merged and disappeared among the Nairs. There was a decline in migration after the collapse of the Cheraman Perumal kingdom. With the change of conditions on both sides of the Western Ghats, Vellalas started once again migrating from Tamil Nadu to eastern parts of Kerala like Idukki district, Pathanamthitta District some centuries ago. From the copper-plate inscriptions in the possession of Syrian Christians, we understand that the Vellalas must have settled on the west coast in the 9th century at the earliest. They are prominently found in Erattupetta, Pala, Ponkunnam, Kanjirappally, Thodupuzha, Pathanamthitta etc.\n\nFor most part of the history of Vellalas in Kerala, I am indebted to Dr.Kanam Sankara Pillai and as he has written much about the Vellalas, I have very little left with, to say. According to Keralotpathi, Parasurama after reclaiming the land from the sea gave it to the Brahmins. When he returned after some years, it was found that there was total anarchy because of the inefficient administration of the then rulers. So he brought efficient and experienced rulers from Tamilnadu (Paradesom). They were called “Perumakkanmar.” Kerala was under Perumal rule for many years and the last one was Cheraman Perumal who was said to have converted to Islam and migrated to Mecca. During the Perumal rule they brought Vellalas–the cultivators and accountants of Tamilnadu — to Kerala. They settled permanently here and many of them became traders and accountants. They were posted as accountants in Government offices and hence were called “KanakkaPilla”. In all “Mandapathinkal Vathilkkal”(Taluk Head Quarters) there were Vellala houses. As Village officers (“Pillaannan”) they were highly efficient. The Cheraman Perumal Nayanar of Chera dynasty was of Vellala stock. It is borne out by some happenings. K.P.P. Menon in his history of Cochin points out that whenever the throne of the Cheraman Perumals fell vacant, the next king was elected from among the Vellala community. His reported conversion to Islam is doubted by historians. Prof. A. Sreedhara Menon concluded that it is originated as a figment of imagination or as a case of mistaken identity and continued to be reproduced without critical examination. Sociologist S. Devadas Pillai, a student of G.S.Ghurye, on the Islam conversion legend has said that “modern historians have found no evidence to back up this legend.”\n\nDuring the reign of Balarama Varma who came after Dharma Raja, the melezhuthu Pillai (Chief Secretary) was Vellala. The Dalavas of Marthandavarma, Arumugham and Thanu Pillai were Vellalas. Viranminda Nayanar of Chenganoor who donated lands for the Mahadevar temple there, was a Vellala. Dr. Champakaraman Pillai [1891-1934], the first ever freedom-fighter who chose the path of armed struggle against the British, was born in Trivandrum to Chinnaswamy Pillai and Nagammal of the Nanchil Vellalas community. It was he who coined the term ‘Jai Hind’ which was later adopted by Subhas Chandra Bose. Vellala historians of Kerala has the onerous task of proving the Vellala identity of great personalities such as, for example, Pattom Thanu Pillai, Vaikom Padmanabha Pillai, and K.M.Balaraman Pillai, among many others, for I find many of them having been listed as Nairs."
