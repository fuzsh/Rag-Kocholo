        "text": "From: Rakesh Chandra 19 March 2001\n\nI recently came across this website. I am not Tamil. Although I appreciate and respect the rich Tamil heritage and culture, I fail to understand why the mythical 'Aryan-Invasion-Theory' should be a basis for Tamil nationalism. I can enumerate several points which modern researchers have put forth to debunk this theory:\n\n(1)No Evidence of any Aryan-Dravidian conflict or any war is available.\n\n(2)There is nothing called an 'Aryan' race. Arya just means a noble one.\n\n(3)How do you explain that Ravana in Ramayan was an accomplished Brahmin? Wasn't he a \"Dravidian\"?\n\n(4)How come Tamil and non-Tamils both believe in the Vedas, worship similar Gods etc.? How come Tamils have Sanskrit origin names?\n\n(5)The minor differences in skin color are not prominent enough, that north-Indians can be said to be belonging to a distinct race. There are similar variations even among Europeans. For example East Europeans look different from West Europeans, the Germans from British and so on.\n\n(6)Skin variations can also be caused due to different climatic conditions and diet.\n\n(7)Why hasn't it been ever considered that Vedic Hinduism is essentially native to India (Indus-Sarasvati culture)? Maybe it was just comprised of a federation of different ethnic groups, following the same philosophical principles, culture and religion.\n\n(8) The original Varna system was supposed to be flexible, so that a person could change his/her caste based on merit.\n\nIt is indeed sad to see that a false Aryan Invasion theory propagated by the colonial missionary zealots aimed at dividing and denigrating Hinduism is being so blindly accepted by us Indians.\n\nResponse: We agree with you that the Aryan Invasion Theory and the 'Aryan/Dravidian divide' has been increasingly questioned by many researchers. Dinesh Agrawal's essay on the Demise of the Aryan Invasion Theory has appeared at this website from the date of its launch. Again, Navaratna S. Rajaram and Davis Frawley have also explored the question in their Vedic \"Aryans\" and the Origins of Civilization: A Literary and Scientific Perspective. We do not seek to found Tamil nationalism on the basis of the Aryan invasion theory - nor for that matter, on notions of race. A nation is not a race. To assert that it is, would be to be found a nation on elusive (and often non existent) physical characteristics. A nation is a togetherness\n\n\"... rooted in the past and which has grown through a process of differentiation and opposition. It is not nature or nurture - but, it is both. It is a togetherness given expression in a distinct language and a culture but it is not simply a cultural togetherness. Neither is it simply an economic togetherness. It is also a political togetherness concerned both with the structure and the exercise of power in a world frame.\"\n\nWe have attempted to explain the elements of that togetherness in 'What is a nation?' and it is that togetherness that we seek to nurture. Here, it is perhaps, also important for us to point out that in our view:\n\n\"...the growing togetherness of the Tamil people, is but a step in the growth of a larger unity. We know that in the end, national freedom can only be secured by a voluntary pooling of sovereignties, in a regional, and ultimately in a world context. ... we recognize that our future lies with the peoples of the Indian region and the path of a greater and a larger Indian union is the direction of that future. It is a union that will reflect the compelling and inevitable need for a common market and a common defence and will be rooted in the common heritage that we share with our brothers and sisters of not only Tamil Nadu but also of India. It is a shared heritage that we freely acknowledge and it is a shared heritage to which we have contributed and from which we derive strength...\"\n\nAnd this is a view that was declared at Thimpu in 1985 and which we expanded upon recently in the Tamil Nation & the Unity of India.\n\nFrom: Dev Mahadevan USA, 12 March 2001\n\nI would like to point out something on the discussion on 'Brahmanism and Tamil Nation'. Of the four Tamil Saivaite saints, three were Brahmins. The entire Tamil Saiva community rate their work above the four Sanskrit Vedas. Would it not be nice to come together as one Tamil people instead of separating ourselves based on caste and creed? Yes, I am born as a Brahmin. My best friends are not Brahmins. My two brothers married outside caste and race. My parents and grandparents taught me not discriminate on the basis of caste. They instilled in me reverence for Nandanar who merged with Siva due to his devotion. Often times I become tired of these discussions because of some of the negative connotations associated with it. Would it not be a good effort bring everybody together, whosoever they may be, under one Tamil fold?\n\nResponse: We share your views. Caste divides. It weakens us. We cannot build on narrow (and divisive) foundations. Yes, there is a need to transcend caste and nurture the growing togetherness of the Tamil people - and we believe that each one of us has something meaningful to contribute, however small that contribution may be. Postmortems about the past are useful only to the extent that they guide our actions in the future. Here, we have found Jacob Pandian's assessessment in Caste, nationalism, and ethnicity : an interpretation of Tamil cultural history and social order, helpful:\n\n\"Ethnic systems arise from the self-conscious, organized use of ethnicity to conceptualise self and/or collective identity. This self conscious, organized use of ethnicity may be characterized as identity summation. Individuals seek consistency and coherence in their formulation of identity, but ethnicity qua ethnicity does not have systemic consistency or coherence. Within the same cultural tradition, a number of political and religious symbols of greater or lesser importance exist, and some of these have more continuity and have greater relevance as representing cultural boundaries. It is not necessary for these symbols to be interrelated as a systemic whole. It is true that these symbols often fuse each other's meanings and are transformed to convey a collective or synthetic meaning; but the fusion, transformation and synthesis occur in their use to conceptualise identity.. ..the Tamils use the symbols of Tamilakam, Panchayat, Chenthamil, Amman, Nadu Veadu and Karppu in the conceptualization of collective identity. Some of these symbols are directly related to jati group identity and others to Tamil ethnic identity. But jati and Tamil ethnic identities are not opposed; in fact, both jati and Tamil ethnic identities have common epistemological roots, although Tamil language serves as the emblem of Tamil identity and distinctive ritual/political emblems represent jati identity...\"\n\nFrom: B. Manjunath,16 January 2001\n\nThese are the Tamil Brahmins who have contribute to Tamil: C.V.Raman, (Nobel Prize Winner), Chandrashekar (Nobel Prize Winner), Subramaniam (Nobel Prize Winner), M.S.Subbulakshmi (Bharatharatna), Subramaniya Bharathi (Poet & Freedom Fighter), T.N.Sheshan (Politics). Many, many musicians, may be more than 100 and thousands of scientists and IT professionals who have made Tamil popular on the Web are Tamil Brahmins.\n\nResponse: M.S.Subbulakshmi may not have been a Brahmin, though she was married to one. But be that as it may, many hundreds of Brahmin Tamils have contributed to the growth of Tamil togetherness. The foundations of the Tamil renaissance of the 19th century were laid by the work of U.V.Swaminatha Aiyar and Thamotherampillai. Another Brahmin, the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan is still remembered, and honoured, at Trinity College, Cambridge University. Kalki Krishnamurthy was 'a colossus striding the Tamil journalistic field' and for many his Ponniyin Selvan served as a window to the mighty Chola empire. Again, as you rightly point out, today, many IT professionals in many parts of the world are making an enduring contribution to the Tamil digital revolution. Jacob Pandian's Caste, nationalism, and ethnicity : an interpretation of Tamil cultural history and social order is an important contribution to further our understanding of the Tamil collective identity.\n\nFrom: Muhammad Backer, Emirates 13 July 2000\n\nCaste and Religious Chauvinism: This website is very nice. One of the viewers quoted some remarks such as Brahmins are not Tamils. Such kind of chauvinism - caste or religious should not be encouraged. In fact, the contribution by Brahmin communities to Tamil language is remarkable. I request the owner of the site not to publish such articles which creates hatred feelings on the basis of caste or religion. We are in the internet age.\n\nFrom: V. Thangavelu Canada, 12 May 2000\n\nVanakkam. Till today. I did not had the opportunity to read the response of my friend Ramalingam Shanmugalingam to my piece \"Brahminism and Tamil Nationalism.\" ....\n\nI judge others purely on their deeds, not words. It does not matter who that person is or how great his standing in the political or literary world. In short I don�t hold a brief for someone because he happens to be my friend, relative, mentor, idol, guru or what else. I scrupulously follow Valluvar�s advice \"After lending ear to many expositions by several persons, one should be able to weigh them all and determine the beneficial element in them. That which helps in this alone is to be called wisdom\" (Kural 423).\n\nThe problem with Shan... (is that) he does not analyse the subject with a critical mind .... At this point I want to make a distinction between the Tamil scholar Kalaignar Karunanidhi and the politician Dr. M. Karunanidhi. The former has a place in history for having given new poise, style and vigour , on par with Anna, to spoken and written Tamil. It still amazes me how a school dropout managed to master the Tamil language and use it with such deadly effect! But the political Kalaignar is a different \"kettle of fish\" altogether, and a total disappointment. When the history of Tamil Eelam is written he will be referred to as the modern day Nero who fiddled while Tamil Eelam was burning!\n\nShan�s drawing a comparison between Pazh Nedumaran and K.Veeramny does not hold water. In fact it is a poor comparison and shows a lack of knowledge about Tamilnadu politics. Pazh Nedumaran did not mount AIADMK�s political platforms to canvass votes for Jayalalitha! . Nor did he confer the title \"Samookaneethi Kaaththa Veerangkanai\" on Jeyalalitha! Today Jeyalalitha is the most virulent critic of the LTTE just like the maverick Dr. Subramaniam Swamy, N.Ram and Thuklak Cho.\n\nShe raises the bogey of LTTE \"destabilising\" Tamil Nadu at the drop of a hat! It is she who cries wolf all the time about LTTE cadres infiltrating� into Tamil Nadu which she knows is false.\n\nShe exploited the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi for her own political ends. She literally and metaphorically rode to power in 1990 over the corpse of Rajiv Gandhi. She accused the DMK of a hand in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi which she knows very well is palpably false.\n\nOnly the year before she was singing a different tune. Jeyalalitha declared that if anything was to happen to Prabhakaran at the hands of the SLA, the whole of Tamil Nadu would rise like one man to defend him!\n\nAs far as I know only once did Pazh Nedumaran accompany Jeyalalitha to Delhi to canvass support for the implementation of the Mandala Commission report. As an indefatigable and committed supporter of Tamil Eelam cause Pazh Nedumaran and Jeyalalitha stand at opposite poles! So with K.Veeramany who has toned down or given up totally his support for Tamil Eelam lately. In an interview to Kumudam, Veeramany declared that it was true he supported the LTTE once up on a time, but he had since given it up. I can understand his fear of TADA.\n\nMy assessment of Kalaignar, Shan might claim, is not representative of majority Tamil opinion. So let me quote for the benefit of Shan what Muthu Kannan from Tamil Nadu has to say about Chief Minister Karunanidhi. I took this from Tamil Canadian web site (Talking Point) .\n\n\"I am very disappointed with our CM Karunanidhi�s speech today. He says that he will welcome Tamil Eelam if LTTE wins it in a war or in a peace talk by its own. But he says that there is a ban on LTTE in India and therefore he won�t allow Tamil Nadu to be used as a base for Eelam activities. Also he says that he has put 60 checkpoints over the Tamil Nadu coast so that essential things like medicine, food and petrol are not taken to Eelam for injured Tigers or their use. I have lost all the respect I had for him. If he can�t help the Eelam Tamils at this critical stage when is he going to help the TAMILS? May be his desire to help the Tamils is reduced by the fact that his nephew Murasoli Maran is a Minister in the BJP government. Murosoli Maran is known here as careerist and he is not bothered about TAMIL people�s plight in TAMIL NADU or EELAM. M. Maran is only concerned about himself! I have got nothing against Murosoli Maran but just telling what the ordinary people are talking here in Tamil Nadu! .......\"\n\nLet me tell my friend that unlike Karunanidhi, if MGR was alive today, he would have sent train loads of food, medicine and clothing to the Tamil people reeling under the military jackboot of President Chandrika�s Sinhala army! He would not have cared a damn for the Central government when the issue is about offering humanitarian assistance to alleviate hunger and thirst of fellow Tamils.\n\nAs for Shan�s claim that Kalaignar�s government got \"dismissed twice for his alleged support for Freedom Fighters \" it is not true... On the contrary in 1990 Karunanidhi�s government was dissolved not because of his support to freedom fighters, but in spite of Karunanidhi locking hundreds of wounded LTTE cadres who had earlier gone to Tamil Nadu for medical treatment at his invitation.\n\nThe then erstwhile socialist Prime Minister Chandrashekar who wanted to become the PM at any cost though he had less than 35 MPs in Parliament, at the behest of Rajiv Gandhi, dismissed the DMK government though Karunanidhi went to Delhi and fell at his feet to save it.\n\nThese unfortunate boys are still locked up in the notorious Tippu Mahal Special camp at Veloor along with those acquitted in Rajiv Gandhi�s murder case by the Supreme Court!\n\nKalaignar Karunanidhi also refused to admit the crew of �Ahat� ship who got acquitted by the Vizhakapattanam Court.\n\nAgain did not Kalaignar expel Vaiko from the DMK on the spurious charge the latter conspired with the LTTE to assassinate him? A blatantly unfounded and un-substantiated charge just to get Vaiko out of the way and make room for Stalin? How can anyone in his right mind hatch such a conspiracy theory about someone who thought it is dis-respectable to talk to Kalaignar while seated?\n\nOnly last week he banned the Conference organized by Pazh Nedumaran and his supporters at Chithamparam to celebrate the fall of Elephant Pass to the LTTE. And after all these he calls himself \"Thamizh Inath Thalaivar�! O Tempore! O Mores!\n\nIn regard to Jain�s Commission, Kalaignar had nothing to fear. He was not a proxy to the conspiracy or murder of Rajiv Gandhi although Jeyalalitha and Dr.Subramaniam Swamy were pointing the accused finger at him for ulterior motives. The assassination took place when Tamil Nadu was under governor�s rule. But Kalaignar did not have the courage to tell the Commission that he did not go to receive the returning IPKF because their hands were soaked with the blood of thousands of innocent Tamils! Instead he told a white lie that because IPKF was returning home after losing thousands of soldiers he simply did not have the stomach to see them or receive them!\n\nNow to Kalaignar�s \"new line of interpretative ability re Tamil literature is unparalleled and unheard of\" is an over reaction. Churning of such plethora of adjectives comes only from those who see the stone not for what it is but as god! Probably Shan is mixing Kural Oviyam with Kalaignar's latest commentary on Thirukkural! These are two different works. As for his Thirukkural commentary it is a hotchpotch which is neither fish nor fowl! I like Shan to read the book \"Thirukkuralum Thiravida Iyakkamum\" by K.Thirunavukkarasu to get a balanced view. If he does not have a copy I am prepared to lend mine.\n\nThe Tamils don�t expect anything from a person like Jeyalalitha whose entry to politics is an unmitigated disaster for Tamils and Tamil Nadu. She had no qualification or experience for such a job. MGR made the biggest mistake of his life when he brought Jeyalalitha from obscurity to fame. But mercifully Jayalalitha does not claim she is the leader of the 60 million Tamils. The fall is greater when the pedestal is high! But Kalaignar and Veeramany (Thamizhr Thalaivar) both make bombastic claims. That is why my disappointment is very profound when I find both whom I �worshipped� are gods with clay feet! As for his protest over receiving Bill Clinton, well if Shan wants me to thank him for small mercies I will. But unlike him I will not sing praise or write eulogies about those who don�t deserve such praise.\n\nFinally I wish to remind Shan that it is Valluvar who exhorted freedom fighters to take care of the internal enemies first. It is no coincidence that Dr.Subramniam Swamy wants the Indian government to send its army to arrest the LTTE leader, or The Hindu editor to declare that the fall of Elephant Pass is a \"threat to peace\" or N.Ram to give space to Rohan Gooneratna, the well know LTTE baiter to denigrate and belittle the LTTE!\n\n\"It is easy to pluck out a thorny tree while it is yet growing. The attempt to cut it down, after it is fully-grown will only cause harm to the hand (Kural 879)\n\nFrom: Ramalingam Shanmugalingam USA 7 May 2000\n\nVanhakkam Tamilnation. I have pleasure in appending below my effort to say some of the untolds in Thangavelu's \"Brahminism and Tamil Nationalism\".\n\nTime and place, I have said many times, should determine policies and practices... During British rule, things were not the same as they are today, everywhere, including India and Ceylon.\n\nCensus Superintendent W. R. Cornish wrote in 1871 that, \"politically it is not to the advantage of the government that every question connected with the progress of the country should be viewed through the medium of Brahmin spectacles. . The true policy of the state would be to limit their numbers in official positions and to encourage a large proportion age non-Brahmin Hindus and Muslims to enter official service so as to allow no special preeminence or preponderance of particular caste\" (Report on the Census of Madras Presidency 1871 Vol. P. 197)\n\nThough affirmative action existed on paper, the inequality was maintained even after independence.\n\nE. V. R. Periyar was not an exception to changing positions when expediency dictated change. In 1919 Periyar relinquished his position as Municipal Chairman, District Board Member and Taluka Board member in one resignation to join the All India Congress and was subsequently elected Chairman of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee. Later, because of internal caste and class squabbles Periyar left the Congress.\n\nWhen Periyar made Hindi fanatics withdraw from demanding official or national language status for Hindi as a link language, 'aRignar' C. N. Annadurai - 'anhnhA' wrote in his book 'perijAr oru cakAptam' (Periyar - an Epoch) and I give my\n\ninterpretation as follows:\n\n\"The language issue was a simple problem to him. He was more concerned about cultivating humanity among the people of Tamil Nadu; their belief in savagery, policies that transcend the country, policies that make man an animal, and those destructive policies that were discarded by the rest of the world some two to three centuries ago should be made to vanish; these undesirables should be removed and Tamils should engage in clear thoughts, and should shine with distinction with rationality and culture in their deeds; he was convinced in the need for a knowledge revolution and centred his vision on that. That keen vision personified is Periyar.\"\n\nLamenting the betrayal of Periyar by his strong followers and disciples today is anachronistic. Even 'anhnhA' broke away from the Dravida Kazham and formed the DMK. The AIADMK is a break away from 'anhnhA's' DMK. Political expediency of the times dictated changes and not disloyalty to the policies of Periyar. Many blame K. Veeramany for his association with Jayalalitha. Why even 'paza' Nedumaran, the long time \"mentor\" of the freedom fighters has not done anything different from Veeramany in looking up to Jayalalitha for help. In fact Eelam Tamils are indebted to Nedumaran for his continued support. It was Churchill at the peak of WWII declared that he was prepared to join the devil for a larger cause. So what is wrong with Veeramany joining the devil Jayalalitha? If it is all right for Nedumaran it should be good for Veeramany.\n\nIt is uncharitable to impute motives for somebody's omission or commission in the Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka. Even MGR in the early days of Tamil militancy kept aloof on the grounds that as a film star he had fans among the Sinhalas and hence would not like to alienate them. But, subsequent events proved that he has done his part well.\n\nOn the other hand, Kalaignar is the most abused of Tamil Nadu leaders. It is of no consequence that Kalaignar unashamedly or advisedly compromised the lofty ideals of Periyar, since MGR was the first Dravida Kazhakam offspring to include a Brahmin in his cabinet. His extra marital passion fashioned a Brahmin non-Tamil to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Fate had no hand in these anomalies. It is hate and the good going rate for the biggest noise in Tamil Nadu politics.\n\nPeriyar in his 'iLygnarkaLukku azyppu' took to task those who pay lip service to anti-Arya rhetoric. I give my interpretation from \"Invitation to Youth\":\n\n\"....The reason for the subjugation of Tamils to Aryans are the epics and sacred narratives. What else can it be? Muslims and Christians are not trapped into Aryan subjugation like Tamils, because they hate and undermine Aryan yarns, sacred narratives and theories worse than human excretion. We can also realise this through history. The obvious is evident. We pretend to hate the Aryans and their philosophy in our rhetoric. In effect our praise of the Aryans and their philosophy is very evident in our praise of Ramayanam and Periya Puranam.\"\n\nBut, today, things have changed. Some Brahmins are reluctant to call themselves Brahmins as much as some non-Brahmins are reluctant to call themselves Tamils. In a changing world, it is what I believe and it is my work towards realizing my aspirations that counts and if that has a following so much the better.\n\nI had an interesting experience with Kalaignar. I was demonstrating the Character Phonetics Yarzhan Tamil Editor to Kalaignar and his colleagues and emphasized on the retention of the traditional letters before the Periyar improvement to some odd letters for reducing the number of characters.\n\nKalaignar was not in favor of going back to the traditional style and he said, \"How can we go back on what Periyar has caused?\" I could have asked the same question: then why did you \"compromise on Periyar's lofty ideals?\" But that was not the purpose of my visit. I appreciate his position vis a vis the Tamil Freedom Fighters. His government was dissolved twice for his alleged support for the Freedom Fighters. There is no evidence of any worthwhile protests. The \"Sword of Damocles\" was hanging over his head during the Jain Commission investigations with every conceivable anti-Kalaignar force working overtime to remove him from the political scene. Again, political expediency is prompting Kalaignar to react to situations within India.\n\nIt was Kalaignar who raised his voice against Prime Minister Vajpayee's Hindi narration during Clinton's visit to India. It is said that as Lenin gave teeth to Karl Marx's work, Kalaignar has given a new light to Thirukkural with his 'kuRaLOvijam'. Kalaignar's new line interpretative ability re Tamil literature is unparalleled and unheard of. For that I salute him. After all he is also human and perhaps give in more easily at times to minor human urges such as anger, or disappointment, but his record as a\n\nyoung Dravida leader is unsurpassed.\n\nTamils have to consolidate their energies to stop the war and establish Tamil Eelam. Tamils have more than what Tamils can chew in the opposition. India, is in a better position to help give peace a chance in Sri Lanka and Tamil Eelam. The Sinhala Government in their arrogance derived from borrowed strength will even try to bite the hand that feeds it.\n\nThis is the time for Tamils to be careful with words that will meliorate rather than indulge in pejoratives. Let us sing songs of praise and not amphigory, however legitimate our anger may be. Let us rise above \"Gallery Theatrics\". If we have to pin point\n\nsomething, let us be balanced. What may seem friendly may change with time and place and turn enemy. The haves try to control the have nots - even their spirit. Such is the time and place in which we live. But whatever the climate may be, Tamil aspirations should not be shaky. The means to the end may change but the end should remain in tact.\n\nTamils should never forget the fact, that Tamils learn Tamil and come to know Thirukkural but foreigners come to know the gift of Tamil through Thirukkural. Today, the freedom fighters are in an advantageous position, but the war has still got to be won and I would like to remind my fellow Tamils to look up to Valluvar for guidance and for starters like to give you all,\n\n'perukkattu vEnhdum panhital ciRija\n\ncurukkattu vEnhdum ujarvu.\" Kural 963\n\nHumility in Prosperity\n\nDignity in Adversity.\n\nFrom: V. Thangavelu Canada, 30 April 2000\n\n[Others] have commented on the role of Tamil Nadu Brahmins and the press controlled by them to denigrate, belittle and ridicule the national liberation struggle of the Tamil people. Publications like The Hindu and Frontline are in the frontline in this sordid campaign against Tamil nationalism in general and the national liberation struggle spearheaded by the LTTE in\n\nparticular.\n\nE.V.R.Periyar, the greatest reformer in the history of Tamil Nadu, advised Tamils that �if they see a Brahmin and a snake at one and the same time, they must thrash the Brahmin. first.� Though Periyar did not literally mean what he said, he was driving home the point that the Brahmins as a social group, with notable exceptions, have continuously opposed, oppressed and exploited the Tamils for the last two thousand years. They claimed superior caste status for themselves as something divined by God (s) and Vedas, called Tamils Sudras, eulogised Sanskrit as Deva Bhasha and dubbed Tamil as Neesha Bhasha not worthy for worship in the temples Tamil themselves built!\n\nPeriyar before he died lamented the fact that his mission to uplift Tamils was half-finished and still leaving the Tamils the stigma of being called Sooththirar! His successors though invoking his name to capture and consolidate political power have turned their backs on Periyar and betrayed his ideals paying only lip service to him now and then! These days DK leader K.Veeramani is playing an ignoble role as the Rajaguru of Jayalalitha (described as such by Ananthi of BBC Thamil Oosai), though the latter heading a Dravidian political party had turned her Poes Garden residence into a Yakasalai for performing moth-eaten Hindu rituals.\n\nJayalalitha, when she was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (1990-96), publicly declared on the floor of the Tamil Nadu state assembly that she was proud to be called a Paappathi! Jeyalalitha rose to politics exploiting her closeness to MGR, but she had jettisoned MGR�s policy of unstinted support for the Tamil Eelam cause overboard. She and her party are now easily the most vicious critics of the LTTE. Apparently her caste consciousness and her hatred for Tamil nationalism got better of her!\n\nAs for Kalaignar Karunanidhi he has unashamedly compromised the lofty ideals of Periyar and the Dravidian movement to gain political power. He no more speaks about the evils of Brahmins or Brahminism....\n\nAs rightly pointed out the Brahmins control 90% of the print media in Tamil Nadu with a total monopoly on English language newspapers. Those who want to know the machinations of Brahmins should read the recent Hindu editorial captioned �Turning point in Sri Lanka�. On the capture of Elephant Pass by the LTTE, true to form the Hindu editorial proclaimed �The moment for collective political action has arrived. The capture of the strategically vital pass by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is the most serious setback that peace has suffered in the island in the past five years.... and must considerably enhance the bargaining power of the LTTE.�\n\nLast week when the Madras High Court ruled against the Government Order issued by the Tamil Nadu state government making Tamil language the medium of education in Kindergarten schools upto standard V, a move vigorously opposed by\n\nJayalalitha, the Hindu could hardly suppress its glee! It gloated over the discomfiture of the Tamil Nadu government. Not only The Hindu, other Brahmin owned or controlled publications like the Thinamalar, Thinamani, Frontline, Kalki, Ananda Viakadan, Kumudam, Cho�s Thuklak, just to name a few, were equally hilarious in claiming the judgement as a rebuff to �Tamil extremism�!\n\nThe same publications have now turned their guns against Vaiko for his speech at the human rights rally held in Geneva. Not to be left out the notorious LTTE baiter Dr. Subramanian Swamy, who polled less than 25,000 votes and lost his deposit during the last general elections to the Lok Saba in Madurai constituency, said he would seek an appointment with President Mr. K.R.Narayanan to apprise him of the MDMK chief's \"impropriety\".\n\nSo while fighting for our national liberation , let us also at the same fight against the internal enemies of Tamil Nationalism and make Periyar dreams a reality. We should not forget the saying of Tamil sage Valluvar � It is easier to pluck out a thorny-tree while it is still young and growing! Any attempt to cut it down after it is fully gown will only cause harm to one�s hands ( Kural 879).\n\nFrom: Thamilselvan, Australia, 29 December 1999\n\nI have been a regular reader of Tamil Nation. We are thankful for the excellent information provided by your web site. But this section about the Aryan Invasion Theory, stands in stark contrast to all other valuable information provided in your web site.\n\nMy grandmother used to say \" Arya Koothu\" for actions which are disguised to hide their ulterior motives. I feel the writings by some of these people about this Aryan Invasion Theory is also an \"Arya Koothu\" to disguise their true motives of keeping Bharatha together and for propagating Pan India sentiments.\n\nBut the real danger is, in this process the true history gets distorted and we will be the ultimate losers as ever. These people have their own vested interests in propagating this anti Aryan Invasion Theory to advocate their own ends.\n\nTheir writings are in stark contrast to what ever is known in real history and what ever is recorded in authoritative information bases such as Encyclopaedia of Britannica . For example, in the Encyclopaedia of Britannica a search on the word 'Agastya' discloses:\n\n\"The history of Tamil Nadu begins with the establishment of a trinity of Tamil powers in the region--namely, the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. By about AD 200 the influence of northern Aryan powers had progressed, and the Aryan sage Agastya had established himself as a cultural hero.\"\n\nThere is no doubt this is an authentic record of real history. To this day, we are reeling under this impact of our 'Aryan Cultural Heroes'.\n\nThese Aryan cultural heroes from the very beginning, have been systematically destroying Dravidian culture by demeaning Dravidian culture and Tamil language.\n\nWe can see at the Tamil temples even the Tamil God - Lord Muruga needs Sanskrit translators to interpret our pleas. It is unthinkable that the ancient Tamils at their height of civilisation would have tolerated a foreign language such as Sanskrit to converse with their gods. This is only a strange phenomenon encountered in our contemporary Tamil life. The reason is, the Aryan invasion is well entrenched and goes very deep into Tamil psyche.\n\nThe Tamils have been indoctrinated to believe that their language is inferior (Neecha Pasai) to converse with the higher echelons such as gods and only the Aryan language Sanskrit (Theva Pasai) is suitable for this purpose. It was even drilled into them that the Vedic chants will have their real power only if it is pronounced in chaste Sanskrit. Then of course, you need the middle man or our famous Parpan (Brahmin) to do the translation for us. This is when the rot or decline started for this ancient Dravidian civilisation. The foreign Brahmins dominated in all our cultural spheres and brought the decline of our civilisation.\n\nThe Aryan north Indians and Dravidian south Indians are ethnically different by their culture , physical look and languages. There is no escape from this simple truth. The only common thread is Hinduism. But even in Hinduism there are lots of differences. For example, god Muruga is not worshiped in North India. In fact, the warrior Tamil god Muruga may have been a later day Tamilian answer to the North Indian warrior gods such as Rama.\n\nThere are also other historical evidences such as the following piece of recorded history:\n\nRajendra Chola (reigned 1014-44) outdid Rajaraja's achievements and sent (1023) an expedition to the north that penetrated to the Ganges River and brought Ganges water to the new capital, Gangaikonacolapuram.\n\nIn Tamil historical records, it was recorded that Rajendra Chola also captured two Aryan Kings and brought them back. So it can be seen that the ancient Tamils themselves were calling these usurpers as Aryans who were very different to them.\n\nEven today, from the shrill cry emanating from the Aryan mass media such as the Hindu, Indian Express, (Vaa-santhy? pugal) Front Line, India Today, Ananda Vikatan, Kumutham, Cho Parpan's Thuglak, infact any publication churned out by the Brahmin mass media Inc, including the TV programs are vehemently against our National liberation struggle or anything good for Tamilians is evidence of this great divide between the mainstream Tamilians and the Aryan invaders even after a millennium.\n\nEven today these Aryans adhere to their own tradition (or Pura Nadai) while paying lip service to Tamil and it's culture. They are even ashamed to have Tamil names and are very proud to Sankritize their own names such as the famous Vaa-santhy instead of Vasanthy.\n\nSo it is my humble opinion that this section on Aryan Invasion Theory was planted in your web site by these vested interests to gain credibility and legitimacy ... It would be a great service for our common cause if this Aryan Invasion Theory section could be removed from your esteemed Tamil Nation web site. I have written this letter after carefully thinking over this topic for years.\n\nIn addition, if these writers have any backbone they should fight against and prove that their version is correct with the official information bases such as Encyclopaedia of Britannica, Encarta etc, rather than writing like this for our own local consumption.\n\nFrom: Sam Sampanthar UK 29 December 1999\n\nA subversive thought -\n\nInitially the ancient peoples all over the world worshipped various forces of nature. By the time of the Upanishads it seems to me that most of the thinking Rishis had come to the conclusion that there is in fact nothing beyond our existence. However they were afraid to proclaim the truth indiscriminately to everyone. They were aware that belief in the Law of Karma helped create an orderly society. Just as a blind man needs a stick to help him walk so do most people require some form of religious belief to get through life. Hence the Rishis were prepared to reveal the truth only to those who were ready to receive it. Time and time again you will see this refrain.\n\nYou must have heard of Chithambara Irahasiam- there is nothing behind the curtain hiding the innermost sanctum! Sai Baba says I am God and so are you. The only difference is that I know it and you do not.The implication may be that there is nothing else.\n\nEven today one hesitates to speak the truth.\n\nIt may be best to say that there is only One God but many paths and mention the Law of Karma. The one difference between Hinduism and some of the other religions is that Hinduism is only concerned with the salvation of the self and not with saving of other souls. To that extent it is selfish.\n\nOther religions have dedicated orders whose vocation is serving the less fortunate or they demand that a certain percentage of ones income is given to charity. Hindus spend vast sums building temples and installing images in magnificent attire while ignoring the destitute as it is easy to assuage the conscience saying that it is due to their Karma that they are in that state. Less pomp and more charity may be in order and should be encouraged. In other words Karma Yoga is the only acceptable path in the modern world.\n\nFrom: Rajesh Rajappa, November 1999\n\nI was very impressed with you site. After years of Aryan domination we have tried to break out on our own (thanks to people like Periyar). Inspite of never having been a part of any North Indian kingdom why should Tamil Nadu be a part of the Indian Union. Is there any legal basis on which Tamil Nadu can ask to be a separate country or is it legally impossible ?\n\nResponse from tamilnation: Whilst it is true that Tamil Nadu was never a part of any North Indian kingdom, there may be a need to revisit the whole Aryan invasion theory. There is much that the Tamil people share with their brothers and sisters of India. This is not simply a 'cultural' affinity - it has also something to do with the unifying influence of the single Indian market.\n\nAgain, whilst Periyar's contribution to social reform and anti-casteism are considerable, we may also need to ask why it was that he failed in his demand for Dravida Nadu. Support for the positive contributions that E.V.R. made in the area of social reform and to rational thought, should not prevent an examination of where it was that he went wrong.\n\nAs to the question of the legality of a demand for separation, the short answer is that such a demand would violate the Indian Constitution. In Sri Lanka too, the struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam violates the 6th Amendment to the Sri Lanka constitution. However, the comment of the International Commission of Jurists in 1984 is of some relevance:\n\n\"The freedom to express political opinions, to seek to persuade others of their merits, to seek to have them represented in Parliament, and thereafter seek Parliament to give effect to them, are all fundamental to democracy itself. These are precisely the freedoms which Article 25 (of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights) recognises and guarantees - and in respect of advocacy for the establishment of an independent Tamil State in Sri Lanka, those which the 6th Amendment is designed to outlaw. It therefore appears to me plain that this enactment constitutes a clear violation by Sri Lanka of its obligations in international law under the Covenant...\" (Paul Sieghart: Sri Lanka-A Mounting Tragedy of Errors - Report of a Mission to Sri Lanka in January 1984 on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists and its British Section, Justice, March 1984)\n\nAgain, the real political question may not be one of separation or division but one of determining the terms on which different nations may 'associate' with one another in equality and in freedom - and this may be the issue that the 21st century may have to confront. The growing togetherness of the Tamil people, is but a step in the growth of a larger unity. The words of Sumantra Bose in Reconceptualising State, Nation and Sovereignty merit attention:\n\n\"The clash between the ever-increasing clamour of claims to nationhood and aspirations to sovereignty, on the one hand. and the persistence, indeed consolidation, of visions of a monolithic, unitarian, and indivisible statehood, on the other, certainly represents one of the most striking contradictions, and one of the most fundamental moral and ideological conflicts, of our times... Demands for 'national self�determination' are in one sense, therefore, also a struggle for a higher form of democracy....\n\nThe poetical and philosophical vision that is required today has been eloquently articulated, ironically enough, by radical Tamil nationalists ('chauvinists' and 'separatist terrorists', according to the official wisdom), in l985: 'We know that in the end, national freedom can only be secured by a voluntary pooling of sovereignties, in a regional and ultimately in a world context. And we recognise that our future lies with the peoples of the Indian region, and that the path of a greater and larger union is the (eventual) direction of that future....'\"\n\nFrom: V. Thangavelu, Canada 12 September 1999\n\nI have just read the comments by Thiru Ramkumar Kothandaraman regarding my observations on Kural vs the Geethai.\n\nI can understand ... his attempt to dismiss my criticism of Geethai as the \"illusion of (those) who are brain washed\" etc. Well, it is the Brahmins (not all of them) who brain washed the Tamils into believing they are Sudras � the fourth and the last caste created by god. They were brainwashed to believe even that their own language Tamil originated from Sanskrit. Tamil was called disparagingly as \"neesha paashai\" while Sanskrit was reverently referred to as \"deva paashai\". How a language supposed to be \"deva paashai\" became a dead language will remain a mystery!\n\nTo assert that the Geethai does not advocate \"Varnashram\" is to hide a whole pumpskin in a plate of rice. I have in my possession a dozen Tamil translations of the Geethai including that of Bharathi and one copy in English by Swami Prabhananda and Christopher Isherwood (1996 edition) . In Chapter 4 � Verse 13 this is what Krishna (reincarnation of Lord Vishnu) says to Arjuna � (Translation from Bhagavad � Gita � page 25)\n\n\"I created the four castes which corresponds to the different types of Guna and Karma. I am their author; nonetheless you must realise that I am beyond action and changeless.\"\n\nIn other words \" Though I am the creator, know Me to be incapable of action or change\" - that is I cannot change the four fold division of caste even if I wish....\n\nBelow is the original text in Sanskrit.\n\n\"Sathurvarnayam Maya Sirushdam Guna, Karma Vipasaga Thasya Kartharamabi Mam Vithyakarthara, Mafvyayam \" ( Chapter 4, Slokam 13 )\n\nThere are other slokams which promote this caste system to absurd lengths. Krishna claims that \"one cannot arbitrarily assume the duties which belong to another caste\". \"Prefer to die doing your own duty\" exhorts Krishna. \"The duty of another will bring you into great spiritual danger\". \" Socially the caste system is graded; but spiritually there are no such distinctions.\" \" Everyone can attain the highest sainthood only by following the prescribed path of his caste duty\". \"Doing of duty honours the Devas\"\n\nAgain Krishna claims that \"in every age when Dharmam declines and Adharmam raises its head I come to destroy the evil and restore Dharmam\" (Chapter 4 � Slokam 7) meaning the restoration of the Sathurvarnayam (Sloka 8). The more than 4000 Hindu sub-castes are a by-product of this Varnashrama Dharmam or more aptly Adharmam!\n\n\"Most contemporary Brahmins are more pragmatic and liberal than Dravidian chauvinists...\" asserts my friend.\n\nThis may or may not be true. But judging from Brahmin chauvinists like \"Thuklak Cho\" the journalist, N. Ram, editor of Frontline, Subramanian Swamy, the politician, Ms. Jeyaram Jeyalalitha, the Aiyangar Tamil woman from Kannada � the Brahmins as a social group are vehemently opposed to Tamil nationalism.\n\nNot a single Brahmin owned journal (e.g. the Hindu, Dinamani, Dinamalar, Kalki, Ananda Vikadan etc.) supports the just struggle of the Tamil Eelam Tamils. This despite the fact that the majority of Tamils are Hindus!\n\nThe Brahmin establishment feels threatened that the rise of Tamil nationalism will destroy their claim for caste superiority and social status. It was not for nothing that the Sudras were forbidden to study the Vedas!\n\nThe Geethai unashamedly makes the claim that women, vaishiyars and sudras were born out of the womb of sin (paapayoni)! Even a protagonist of Geethai - like Swami Chinmayananda could not stomach such blasphemous calumny though it came from the mouth of a Divine Avathara. In the Geethai Commentary that he wrote (page 158 -Chennai 1979) he makes the comment -\"Born out of the womb of sin (Papayoniyah) � this term qualifying women, traders and workers, would be a blasphemous calumny against a majority of mankind � an unpardonable crime, even if the statement comes from the Divine mouth of a prophet.\"\n\nThis concept is diametrically opposed to the lofty teachings of the Kural. Valluvar refutes the central teaching of Geethai about birth and declares that \"All beings are the same in birth. But work decides their varied worth\" (Kural 972). Hence my contention is that unlike Thirukkural, Geethai represents a value system fundamentally foreign to Tamil culture. At this point I rest my case for the present.\n\nFrom Ramkumar Kothandaraman 21 June 1999\n\nThiru Thangavelu has directly attacked the Geetai and says that it preaches something that is not preached by Thirukkural and goes on to repeat the usual Dravidian rhetoric about Brahmins, Varnashram etc\n\n� Most of us, who call ourselves proud Tamilians or proud Hindus or proud Indians or proud Sri Lankans or whatever, and who at the drop of the hat compare the Geetai and the Thirukkural, most probably have never completely read and understood the Geetai or the Thirukkural.\n\nGeeta has never talked about varnashram and it is actually an illusion of (those) who are brainwashed to believe that the Geetai has some elements of varnashram in it. The intent is to attack anything that is associated with Brahmins. Most contemporary Brahmins are more pragmatic and liberal than Dravidian chauvinists...\n\nFrom V.Thangavelu, Canada 29 May 1999"
