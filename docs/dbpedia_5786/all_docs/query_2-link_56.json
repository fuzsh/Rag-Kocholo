The fact\n\nthat you did not know about the Vellama and Velamaru which is basic reading\n\nwhen you read about Vellalar shows that you read only anti-Tamil history\n\nwritten by various authors for various political purposes, spefically in your\n\ncountry Sri Lanka where there is an affort to discredit Tamil history even in\n\nTamil Nadu.\n\nYou guys have calimed even ancient Pandyas were Aryan immigarnts from North\n\nIndia only because your prince Vijaya married a Pandyan wife. This is an effort\n\nto tell all your country men that they dont have the inferior Tamil blood in\n\nthem because Vijaya married a Pandiyan princes because she is a superior Aryan\n\nPandiyan princess.\n\nThis is an effort to keep these communities apart and I see you as a person\n\ndoing that in the net under a Tamil name.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> >> Similarly any one who had remote connection to millitary service wants\n\n>to\n\n>> >claim\n\n>> >> Kshatriya ancestry but most probably they ancestors were soldiers and\n\n>> >officers\n\n>> >> in those army not just Kings only.\n\n>> >>\n\n>> >> These antiquated claims are not valid under ethnological, historical and\n\n>> >> genetic studies.\n\n>>\n\n>> >\n\n>> >Have you any evidences to prove that Kaikula or Senguntha people are not\n\n>> >Kshatriyas?\n\n>>\n\n>> Show me your evidence other than a covoluted claim that Khai stood for\n\n>> Kshatriya like Parathavar says it stood for Bharathavas\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>Read some Prakrit and then you will know..\n\nSo you dont have evidence other than the covoluted word trickery\n\n\n\nWhich is what ?\n\n>\n\n>> =Bharath it is all Shudras looking for Kshatriya ancestry word trickery,\n\n>>\n\n>> All the Nayakkar in Tamilnadu wear the Poonool saying that they are\n\n>Kshatriyas\n\n>> too.

You have no evidence\n\n>to show this \"slave\" story.\n\nHow come all Sri Lankan Sinhalese are Shudras and what is the definition of\n\nShudras in north India. If you are north Indian Shudras you were obviously the\n\nprojeny of Aryan masters and their enslaved indegenous women! isnt it.\n\nIt is very likely that when Prince Vijaya came to Sri Lanka he brough along a\n\nlot of Shudra slaves with him because he was a prince for gods sake.\n\nThats why so called Aryans in Srilanka all became Shudras because Shudra\n\nworkers outnumbered the Vijayas clan from day one.\n\nIt is like the English colonist in America taking hundreds more Irish slaves\n\nwith them and with time the Irish outnumber the english 100:1 and every one\n\nbecames Irish.\n\nThe castes system is a like a Pyramid in actuality you can only have one King\n\nand his family but hundreds of thousands of workers. But with time these\n\nslavish workers claim kings ancestry because they want to be better than\n\nothers.\n\nIf you count all the decendants of Pallava king in present day TN they probably\n\nmake upto 25% of Tamil nadu population Ha Ha ha ha ha ha\n\nThe Pallava kings must have been prolific breeders. God for them.\n\n>\n\n>Brahmanical India always tried to down grade Buddhist India. Can you\n\n>understand the Buddhist culture once florished all over India?\n\nTamils were Bhudhist and Jains before they became Hindus in large numbers that\n\ndoes not make some of us Aryan Kshatriyas like you claim.\n\nYou have to remember Thais, Cambodeans, Malyas like Tamils were also subjected\n\nto same three religions and even among Balinese there are people who claim\n\nTrivamsa that is Arya Kshatriya, Arya Vysya, and Brahmidom among them but they\n\nall look like regular Indonesians :-)\n\nRADICAL PRESCRIPTIONS\n\nof Dr K Krishnaswamy\n\nPudhiya Thamizhakam Party (PT), meaning the new party of The Tamil Land, in\n\nTamil Nadu, the southern-most state of India with its coastline facing the Bay\n\nof Bengal, didn't win a single seat in '98 elections.\n\nHowever, this new outfit, launched by Dr Karupaa-samy Krishnaswamy, a Dalit\n\ndoctor, has sent alarm bells ringing among the major political parties of Tamil\n\nNadu by wrecking the chances of DMK Front in five constituencies at least.\n\nThis young Dalit doctor, impeccably dressed, looks every inch a company\n\nexecutive than a militant leader. Is he a Kanshi Ram in the making or a\n\nvisionary?\n\nElectoral politics is not the end for Dr Krishnaswamy. His goal is, he asserts:\n\n\"Liberation of the Dalits.\"\n\nDr Krishnaswamy would stop at nothing to achieve the goal he has set for his\n\nparty, and would not hesitate to exhort his colleagues and followers to hit\n\nback at the oppressors with all their might.\n\nAgainst the allegation of fomenting violence in the 'hitherto calm and peaceful\n\npockets of Southern Tamil Nadu, he says emphatically:\n\n\"...that is a complacent, even callous upper caste/middle class perception.\n\nEverything will be calm so long as the oppressed meekly and mutely put up with\n\nall the injustice meted out to them. When they rise in revolt, they are\n\ndenounced as violent law breakers...mark my words, I am for violently opposing\n\nany form of oppression. Ours is a struggle for survival. But tell me, can you\n\npoint to a single instance wherein we have taken up arms, assaulted or harmed\n\nany castemen other than those who have wronged us?\"\n\nHe started his political life while in college as a member of the Naxalite\n\nfaction of the communists, whose progenitor was a Dalit- Charu Mazumdar, that\n\nputs its faith in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and, suffered a jail\n\nterm under MISA, India's Preventive Detention Act. He explains his caste\n\noriented struggle thus,\n\n\"The Marxist Leninists had adopted wrong tactics to bring about social\n\ntransformation.\"\n\nWhile traditional Naxalites didn't agree with the ideological line taken up by\n\nDr Krishnaswamy, they donot dispute his sincerity in fighting to fulfil the\n\naspirations of the Dalits. No one believes that the Doctor is a saleable to the\n\nhighest bidder.\n\nHe launched a move to forge a larger identity of the Dalits (the downtrodden).\n\nThough of Pallar caste by birth, he organised the exetremely docile cobbler\n\ncommunity in the Coimbatore belt, his home town. But he had to abandon his\n\nefforts following the wrath of Naidus and Gounders. Next he tried to organise\n\nDalit Panther organisation and failed due to strong caste feelings among the\n\ndifferent Dalit sects. So he fell back on Pallars of his own caste and floated\n\nthe 'Devendrakula Vellalar Federation' in the mid 80s.\n\nThe name of his organisation means descendants of God Devendra. This has given\n\nthem pride, self respect and dignity - socially trade related caste names carry\n\nderogatory connotations .\n\n\"..Look. we are dealing with large masses of oppressed in the name of\n\ncaste...if, for them, social recognition comes from such honorific, why should\n\nI stand in the way? I didn't invent the term, surely. But I have no qualms in\n\nusing it, to rally together my people,\"\n\nhe says when asked about his caste claiming lineage from the gods.\n\nDr Krishnaswamy got his political baptism could be be effectively dated to the\n\ndate he sought justice for the Kodiyankulam Dalits who were subjected to\n\nappalling atrocities by the local police. He also fought vigorously the case of\n\nPallars of Tirunelveli in their tussle against upper caste Thevars. Soon he\n\nbecame the rallying point for the Dalits of the entire state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nHe challenged the DMK-TMC combine to win a reserved Assembly seat in '96\n\nelections. Clashes between Thevars and Pallars erupted over a host of issues -\n\nand the formidable doctor was there to guide the counter attacks.\n\n\"For the first time we started hitting back. The Thevars could not even stand\n\nthe naming of a transport corporation after a fold Dalit hero and set up on us\n\nviciously. We retaliated and that was made out to be too violent a reaction,\"\n\nthe doctor says with flashing eyes.\n\n\"Be it Jayalalitha or Karunanidhi, they want to uphold the status quo. But we\n\nare not going to sacrifice our interests in order that only the upper castes\n\ncan live in peace.\"\n\nHis next step? Would he join hands with Dr Ramdas who has the Vanniar votes in\n\nhis pocket and is deeply concerned about Dalits?\n\n\"An alliance with Dr Ramdas is possible, perhaps desirable, but right now he is\n\nin the BJP-AIADMK....that is outrageously Anti Dalit,\"\n\nhe says with a mixture of anger and anguish.\n\nPudhiya Tamizhakam has sought to reach out to all Dalit sections, minorities\n\nand the Most Backward Castes in the recent elections. He did poll muslim votes\n\nand some of the Adi Dravida ( Pariah ) votes.\n\n\"...Gradually we will expand our base,\"\n\nsays Dr Krishnaswamy.\n\nWould he grow in stature by exploiting the poor Dalits like a number of Dalit\n\npolitical bigwigs of the past and present?\n\nWill he grow into another Kanshi Ram, or a real Messiah of the oppressed, only\n\ntime will tell.\n\nArson and killing don't make news anymore in southern Tamil Nadu\n\nPeace has -- mostly -- returned to southern Tamil Nadu.\n\nAt least, so one hopes. And the essential tragedy of this entire thing is that\n\none is reduced to hoping.\n\nMinor incidents remain the order of the day but so intense has been the\n\nconflagration of before, that an arson here or a killing there does not make\n\nnews anymore. Because even a death or three is 'acceptable', or so the feeling\n\ngoes, when set against the situation of April through June this year, when\n\nentire families were decimated, and entire villages evacuated to prevent\n\nwholesale slaughter.\n\nThere is in the observer a sense of deja vu, to this sequence of disorder and\n\norder. The 'Kodiyankulam incidents' of 1994, when scheduled caste villagers\n\nwere beaten up and their community wells poisoned allegedly by the backward\n\nclass thevars in collusion with the local police, witnessed a similar\n\nescalation of violence, followed by an eerie calm.\n\nAt the center of these controversies, invariably, has been the desecration of a\n\nstatue -- either of the late Forward Bloc leader Mutthuramalinga Thevar, or of\n\nB R Ambedkar. This year, as a minor departure from the norm, the clashes were\n\nsparked by an ill-advised state government move to name a public transport\n\ncorporation after Sundaralingam, a patriotic local military commander of a\n\nbygone era.\n\nSuch caste violence is not confined to the southern parts of the state -- the\n\nnorthern districts have seen violence of equal virulence, between the local\n\nscheduled caste communities and the backward class vanniars, through the\n\nseventies. The 'Meenakshipuram conversions' of local harijans to Islam in the\n\nearly eighties -- a surefire spark for violence, one would have thought -- had\n\nthe ironic effect of actually checking the violence. Because for the first\n\ntime, the various subsets of Hindus suddenly woke to the realization that\n\ncontinued violence could actually end up driving Hindus of whatever persuasion\n\ninto Islam's fold.\n\nThe current caste clashes in Tamil Nadu are a contemporary fallout of historic\n\ndevelopments. The intermittent caste clashes, spread out over three or four\n\ndecades, are also an expression of an evolving socio-economic cause getting\n\nlost in its political attainments.\n\nIt's not without reason that the 'self-respect movement' of the Dravidian\n\nparties succeeded in Tamil Nadu, and the Justice Party and its various\n\nmanifestations ruled the roost at the height of the socio-political churning of\n\nthe society. The nawab of Arcot giving away revenue collection rights to the\n\nBritish East India Company in the mid-eighteenth century meant that a region\n\nwith no great kings or kingdoms came under the British rule. And along the way,\n\njobs-on-merit at the hands of the alien ruler meant equal opportunity for equal\n\ntalents in a race for the survival of the fittest.\n\nIf the Brahmin community, because of its better learning, benefited initially,\n\nothers did not lag behind. When education brought them social enlightenment,\n\nthe otherwise well-off upper caste non-Brahmin communities saw through the\n\nsocial imbalances that had no political or economic justification. It needs\n\npointing out that the Justice Party and its predecessors were organizations of\n\nnon-Brahmin upper castes, mostly educated landed gentry, equal to the Brahmins\n\nin education and more than equal to them in economic status, but always one\n\nrung below the Brahmins in social hierarchy and acceptability.\n\nIf the need for societal spread made the non-brahmin movement adopt education\n\nand employment as its 'equalizer-slogans', the attainment of this goal, first\n\nwith the formation of the Justice Party and more so with that party's coming to\n\npower in the 1919 elections, made the movement itself near-redundant. The\n\nCommunal G O of 1921 and its later-day modifications, all formalizing and\n\nlegitimizing the non-Brahmin movement's demands for reservations in education\n\nand employment, benefited only the non-Brahmin upper castes initially. The\n\nintermediary castes and the harijans, the later-day backwards and the scheduled\n\ncastes respectively -- to whom education and hence, non-farming, formal\n\nemployment -- were alien, were left mostly untouched.\n\nIt was thus left to 'Periyar' E V Ramaswami Naicker to take the non-brahmin\n\nmovement to the masses, a decade and a half after Gandhi had succeeded in doing\n\nso with the Congress movement. If the Justice Party could fill the political\n\nvacuum and use its own presence to ensure equality in education and employment\n\nfor the non-Brahmin upper castes, 'Periyar' necessarily had to demythify the\n\nsocial status of the brahmins drawn mainly from religious edicts.\n\nIn the absence of any political power that was available to his later day DMK\n\nfollowers for enforcing their 'social will', Periyar's movement did lead to\n\nstray violence against the brahmins. If it did not gain greater proportions, it\n\ncould be because at the time there was no political protection.\n\nThe violence did not stop, it merely changed shape and contour. Once the\n\n'brahmin question' was settled, then naturally came the divisions within the\n\nnon-brahmin segments. The 'Periyar factor' and the post-Independence\n\nsocio-economic reforms, particularly during the chief ministership of the late\n\nK Kamaraj. has since ensured the spread of education, economic well-being and\n\nconsequent social awareness among the lower strata of the non-brahmin segments.\n\nIf the stresses and strains in the northern districts involved the upper caste\n\nmudaliars and the backward vanniars, the upper caste saiva vellalars were\n\nmostly short-circuited in the south, largely thanks to their numerical\n\nminority. With Kamaraj, as chief minister, over-throwing a brahminical Rajaji,\n\nhis native nadar community usurped the role, and was ranged against the\n\nthevars, the other numerically strong, emotionally backward community in the\n\nregion.\n\nThough that question by itself has not been 'satisfactorily settled', the\n\nperceived political patronage that the thevar community got under the\n\nJayalalitha chief ministership between 1991 and 1996 meant that the target of\n\nthe scheduled castes in the region also remained as focused as that of the\n\nthevars themselves. And the scheduled castes, emancipated by education, and\n\nempowered by economic prosperity compared to their own past, is out to ensure\n\nthat it be heard.\n\nFor all this, however, untouchability as a social curse still exists in many\n\nparts of Tamil Nadu. The victims are always the scheduled castes, but the\n\nperpetrators are not the upper caste brahmins, but the intermediate castes,\n\nlike the thevars, nadars and vanniars. The latter class sees the educated and\n\nemancipated scheduled caste communities vying with them for a share in the\n\nsocio-economic cake by way of employment opportunities and the like.\n\nThis, and the rampant urbanisation of the state at the cost of prosperous\n\nagrarian economy, and the self-assertion -- at times bordering on\n\nself-righteousnes -- by indignant sections of the scheduled caste, have all\n\nmade matters worse. The thevars of southern Tamil Nadu, for instance, have not\n\nbeen able to accept the social assertiveness of the scheduled caste youth,\n\ncaused by education and enlightenment, and the latter's economic prosperity,\n\nagain caused by education and employment, many of them in urban centers and as\n\nfar away as the Gulf.\n\nIt's also true that proximity to the political power-center, namely the state\n\ncapital of Madras, made empowerment that much easier for the backwards first,\n\nand the scheduled castes later, in northern Tamil Nadu. Even the non-Brahmin\n\nmovement of Justice Party vintage had its base among the traditionally\n\npower-conscious mudaliars of the north rather than the saiva vellalars,\n\naddressed as Pillais, of the south.\n\nThough they haven't won political power through elections as yet -- the chances\n\nof them doing it on their own is next to impossible in a caste-conscious state\n\n-- the vanniars of the north have made a political success of their Pattali\n\nMakkal Katchi, taking the socio-political baton from the mudaliars. As it is,\n\nit is, only in the western districts that the dominance of the non-brahmin\n\nupper castes in the socio-political milieu is perceptible.\n\nNearly a century after the birth of the non-brahmin movement, Tamil Nadu is\n\nstill a society in transition. Surviving political identities notwithstanding,\n\nthe movement by itself has outlived its utility, what with the attainment of\n\npolitical power by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the achievements on the\n\nsocio-economic front by Kamaraj, Karunanidhi and MGR in the last 40-plus years.\n\nThe Dravidian parties have lost their social moorings and purpose, as the\n\nBrahmin Jayalalitha's ready acceptance as leader of the AIADMK would show.\n\nOnly, all that has happened before the social agenda of the scheduled castes\n\ncould be fulfilled.\n\nGandhi united the various untouchable communities in the country by addressing\n\nthem as 'harijans'. It is yet surprising that the recent events in southern\n\nTamil Nadu have made a ready acceptance of the Hindi term 'dalit' possible\n\namong the scheduled castes of the state, despite its traditional anti-Hindi\n\nsentiments. The parayars of the northern districts and the pallars of the\n\nsouthern districts, who have been mutually distancing each other, have now come\n\nback under a common tag.\n\nThe absence of a credible dalit political leadership -- the northern districts\n\ngave up the search long back, and the southern districts are alternating\n\nbetween the politically ambitious Dr S Krishnaswamy, heading the Devendra Kula\n\nVellalar Sangam, and the venom-spitting militant leader John Pandian -- is at\n\nthe heart of peripheral interest groups taking a pot-shot at the dalit\n\ncommunities in the state. And of their frustrated youth, in turn, showing a\n\npreference for the law of the jungle rather than the rule of law.\n\n>Pallar and Pallavan is not a Sinhala issue.

This what\n\nyour friend says about Pandiyans\n\n\"It has been also affirmed, after examination of all available evidence, that\n\nfrom the 6th century B.C. onwards Sri Lankan (i.e. Sinhala) kings and South\n\nIndian Pandyan kings would have been Aryans who had established themselves as\n\nthe rulers of the indigenous population (A.
