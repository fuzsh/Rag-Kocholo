The Piramalai Kallars are a sub-caste of the Kallars in Tamil Nadu, India. During the period of Thirumalai Nayak in the 1600s, members of the Piramalai Kallars community were appointed as village guards and performed judicial duties. In the 1800s, with the introduction of British rule, the Piramalai Kallars lost these roles and participated in rebellions against British taxation. They were later classified as a criminal tribe by the British and faced oppression, poverty, and conflict with authorities until the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act in 1948.",
