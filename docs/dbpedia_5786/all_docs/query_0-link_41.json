        "text": "​\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTamil Races and Tribes.\n\nThe oldest of the tribes who dwelt in Tamilakam were the Villavar and Minavar. The Villavar or bowmen (from the Dravidian word vil meaning a bow) inhabited hilly tracts and jungles and lived by the chase: and the Minavar or fishermen (from the Dravidian meen, a fish) subsisted by fishing and resided in the valleys and plains, or on the sea-coast. The two tribes were evidently a primitive race which was spread over the whole of India as they are still found in large nümber in Rajputana and Guzarat, where they are known as Bhils and Meenas, and in the Canarese country, where they are called Billavar.\n\nThese semi-barbarous tribes were conquered by the Nagas who were a very numerous and civilised race, and who at one time or other ruled a great portion of India, Ceylon and Burma. They were mentioned in the Ramayana, and the Naga capital, which probably lay in the heart of the Dekkan is described in that epic as follows :—\n\nFrom the Mahabharata we learn that there were Naga kingdoms between the Jumna and the Ganges about the 13th century B. C. When the kings of the Lunar race of Aryas wanted to found a second capital near the spot where Delhi stands at present, they had to dislodge the Nagas who occupied it. Arjuna, the ​hero of the poem, in his banishment, is said to have married first Ulipi, the daughter of a Naga king, then Chitrangadai, daughter of Chitravahana, the Naga king of Manipura. Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna was killed by Thakshaka, a Naga king, and hence Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit had to wage a long and bloody war with the Nagas and killed thousands of them. They appear again in history in the 6th century B. C. when a Naga dynasty ruled Magadha ; and it was during the reign of Ajatasatru, the 6th king of this race, that Gautama Buddha preached his new faith which soon found favour with the Nagas.[2] Tle Ceylonese historical works all, begin with an account of the Nagas. It appears from these works that in the 6th century B. C. there were powerful Naga kingdoms on the western coast of the island which was called Nagadwipa or Naga island on that account. The Naga capital was at Kalyani. The niece of the king of Kalyani was married to a Naga king of the Kanawaddamano mountain, which was evidently Kandamadanam, a hill near the modern Ramesvaram on the Indian coast, opposite to Kalyani. In the ancient sculptures at Amaravati and elsewhere which were executed more than eighteen hundred years ago, the human figures, which are represented with serpent hoods spread wide at the back of them, are Nagas.[3] Some fragments of the sculptures which were removed from the ruins at Amaravati may now be seen at the Government Museum, Madras. In these sculptures the Naga kings are distinguished by the hood of a five or seven-headed serpent at their back, Naga princesses by a three-headed serpent, and ordinary Nagas by a single-headed serpent. The artists who executed these sculptures with considerable labour and care seem to have imagined that the Nagas partook of the nature of serpents, and that their bodies were partly human and partly serpentine. The ancient Tamil poets appear to have shared this belief, for, they speak of the Nagas who were contemporary with them, as human beings, while at the same time they describe the ancient Nagas as serpents living underground. In describing the antiquity and wealth of Kaviripaddinam, the Chola capital, the author of the Chilappathikaram states that it was as ancient and famous as the ​ ​Metropolis of the Nagas and the Naga-nadu.[4] It appears therefore that within the recollection of the Tamil people who lived eighteen hundred years ago, there was no kingdom older than that of the Nagas. Kaviripaddinam itself is said to have been an ancient seat of the Nagas who had \"curved red lips, large bright teeth, a voice like thunder, who delighted in doing mischief and were always armed with the noose.”[5] Another poet describes the contest of two Naga kings for the sacred-seat of Buddha as follows :— “In the nether regions, two kings who ruled the Naga country contended for the seat, but neither was able to lift it off the ground; loath to give it up, with eyes all aflame and breathing fury, they led their great armies and fought a bloody battle. The great teacher (Buddha) then appeared before them and said ‘cease your strife, this seat is mine’; then he sat upon it and preached the law.”[6] The same poet states that the island of Manippallavam where the sacred seat was placed, was situated at a distance of 30 yojanas south of Kaviripaddinam.[7] He refers also to a town in Gandhara in Northern India, which in consequence of an earthquake “sank a distance of 400 yojanas to Naga-nadu.”[8] From these allusions it is evident that the Tamil poets of this period had a very hazy idea of the ancient Nagas and their country. They believed, in fact, that the Nagas inhabited Pâthâla or the lower world, far below the surface of the earth. Of contemporary Naga tribes and kingdoms they give a more satisfactory account. The first meeting of the Chola king Killi-Valavan and a Naga princess is thus described :-— [9] “One pleasant summer day when Killi who wears the long crown studded with sparkling gems, sought the shade of a green wood, he found a lovely damsel all alone in a bower which was fragrant with sweet-scented flowers. Wondering who ​she was, the monarch stood a while entranced, and the God of Love armed with the conquering bow, swiftly shot his flowery darts deep into the king’s heart. His eyes were charmed with her beauty : with ravished ears, he heard her musical voice: the perfumes of her person confounded his senses, and he who had commanded legions, now became her devoted slave. Full one month he spent with her in that grove in rapturous enjoyment. She told not who she was, nor whence she came, but at the end of that month, she disappeared as suddenly as she had met him at first. Yearning to meet her again, he who had smote many a rival king, now went in search of her, smitten by her matchless charms. He met a saint who could penetrate the caverns of the earth, or soar into the aerial regions,, or dive into the deep ocean; and having made the usual reverence prayed to the saint to find out the hiding place of her who was dear to him as his own life. ‘I know the princess’ said the saint ‘though I have not seen her myself, I have heard of her, listen thou O! monarch. There is a king, whose lance is ever victorious in war, and who rules Naganadu. His name is Valai-vanan and his wife is Vâsa-Mailai: their beloved daughter is the beauteous princess Peeli-Valai. At her birth a seer had foretold that a prince of the solar race would espouse her. Her son will come to you, but thou shalt meet her no more.” That the Chola king Killi-Valavan married, though for a time only, the daughter of a neighbouring Naga king appears to be a historical fact. But Cheethalai-Chaththanar, the author of the poem Mani-mekalai, who was a contemporary of Killi-Valavan has, with poet’s license, given a romantic account of the marriage, probably because he considered it degrading to a Tamil king to marry a Naga princess.\n\nThere were several tribes of the Nagas, such as the Maravar, Eyinar, Oliyar, Oviyar, Aruvâlur and Parathavar. Of these, the Maravar appear to have been the most powerful and warlike tribe, and most hostile to the Tamils. “Of strong limbs and hardy frames” says a poet “and fierce looking as tigers, wearing long and curled locks of hair, the blood thirsty Maravar, armed with the bow bound with leather, ever ready to injure others, shoot their arrows at poor and helpless travellers, from whom they can rob nothing, only to feast their eyes on the quivering limbs of ​their vctims.”[10] They were so numerous especially on the East Coast between the Kaviri and Vaigai rivers, where they are still to be found in large numbers, that they successfully resisted the armies of the Tamil Kings. “The wrathful and furious Maravar” says the Poet quoted above “whose curled beards resemble the twisted horns of the stag, the loud twang of whose powerful bowstrings, and the stirring sound of whose double headed drums, compel even Kings at the head of large armies to turn their back and fly.”[11] Their prowess in battle was so much valued by the Tamil Kings that they were enlisted largely in the Tamil armies. A Marava chieftain named Nalai-kilavan Nagan served the Pandya as a Minister and Commander in his army.[12] Another Marava, Piddank-korran, chieftain of a mountain called Kuthiraimali, was in the service of the Chera King.[13]\n\nThe Eyinar or Vedar were the most lawless of the Naga tribes. Cattle lifting and pillage and murder appear to have been th sole business of their life. Thy worshipped the dread goddess Kâli, and slaughtered buffaloes at her shrine, to secure her favor in their plundering raids.[14] Before starting on their expeditions they usually consulted omens in the chirping and flight of birds.[15] Their descendants are now known by the appropriate title of kallar or “thieves.” Dhirataran Murti-Eyinar the great chief of Viramangalam referred to in the plates of Jatilavarman, a Pandyan King of the twelfth century A.D. appears to have belonged to this tribe.[16]\n\nThe Oliyar were another tribe of the Nagas who, it is said, were conquered by Karikâl-Choia.[17] We find them in power as late as the eleventh century A. D. from an inscription at Mamallapuram [18] This inscription is dated in the 9th year of the reign of the Chola King Koppara-Kesari-Varmman alias Udiayâr-Sri.. Râjendna Déva who defeated Ahawa-Malla, the western Chalukya King (1040—1069 A.D.) at the battle of Kopa. It is the copy of a deed by which a piece of land was granted to the Varâha-Swâmi ​temple at Mâmallai-puram, and which was signed by the following Nagas, amongst other high officers ot the Chola-King :—\n\nOlinagan Madaiyan Alagiya Chola\n\nAmurnaddu Muvenda Velan\n\nOlinagan Chandra Sekaran\n\nOlinagan Narayanan\n\nIndupuravan Sanga-Nagan\n\nUchan-Kilavan Muguli Nagan.\n\nIt appears from this deed that there were, besides the Olinagas, other tribes of the same race, such as Sanga Nagas and Muguli Nagas, in the eleventh century A. D.\n\nAruvalar was a local name of the Naga tribes who inhabited Aruva-Nadu and Aruva-Vadathalai. The Oviyar were a family of the Aruvalar tribe who ruled at Eyil-Paddinam, and were Kings of Mâvilankai about the middle of the second century A.D. when there was a temporary decline of the power of the Cholas and of other Tamil Kings. They are described by a Tamil poet as “Chivalrous and intrepid warriors, fierce as tigers on ‘the battle field.\" [19] The Oviyar were most probably the Basore Nagas alluded to by Ptolemy as Kings of Mélangae.[20] It appears from Ptolemy that at Uraiyur, the Chola capital also, the Cholas were displaced by the Sôre Nagas who were evidently the descendants of Chola and Naga families who had intermarried.[21] About this period the Nagas appear to have risen to power even in Ceylon, judging from the names of the following Kings of the country as given in the Mahâwanso[22]\n\nMahalamana or Mallaga Naga ... 125 A.D.\n\nKuhana or Chanda Naga ........ 173 A.D.\n\nKudanama or Kuda Naga ........ 183 A.D.\n\nKuda Sirina or Sri Naga ...... 184 A.D.\n\nThe Parathavar were a Naga tribe who occupied the sea coast and maintained themselves by fishing or by sea faring. They dived for pearls or for conch shells, and knew the charm to keep off sharks from that part of the sea, where they dived. They were most powerful in the country around Korkai in ​Then-pandinad; “well fed on fish and flesh and armed with bows, their hordes terrified their enemies by their dashing valour.” [23]\n\nThe Nagas, were skilled in many arts and especially in weaving. The Nagas of the Kalinga country were so famous in the art of weaving that the word kalingam in Tamil has come to signify a cloth. At the period which I describe, the Nagas inhabiting the Eastern Coast in the Pandyan territory were great weavers, and exported a large quantity of cloths and muslins. The fine muslins manufactured by the Nagas were highly prized by the Tamils and fetched fabulous prices in foreign countries. [24] Tamil poets allude to a famous chieftain Ay who offered to the image of Siva, one of these priceless muslins which had been presented to him by Nila-Naga.[25]\n\nIt was from the Nagas that the Aryas first learnt the art o writing; and hence Sanscrit characters are to this day known as Deva-nâgari.\n\nWhile the fair skinned Aryas who had entered India through the Kabul valley, were settled in the Punjab, a horde of the yellow races who inhabited the central table land of Asia, appear to have passed southward through the numerous passes between Tibet and Nepal, and occupied the Gangetic Valley. Sanscrit writers name these yellow races Yakshas: Pali chroniclers called them Yakkos: and Chinese historians speak of them as the Yuhem. These yellow races being natives of the higher regions of the earth, considered themselves to be superior to the inhabitants of the plains, arid assumed the name of Daivaputras or “the sons of Gods.” They were intellectually and morally a superior race of people, and eventually spread over the whole of Bengal; and emigrated thence by sea to Southern India and Ceylon.\n\nWhen the Ramayana was composed the Yekshas had reached the southernmost parts of India, and they are alluded to in that poem as inhabiting the sea-coast facing Ceylon.\n\n​\n\nIn the fifth century B. C., when Vijaya the leader ot the first colony of Aryas, from Bengal, landed in Ceylon, he found the island in the possession of the Yakshas, and he first married Kuveni, a Yaksha Princess.\n\nMost of these Magolian tribes emigrated to Southern india from Tamalitti, [27] the great emporium of trade at the mouth of the Ganges, and this accounts for the name.\"Tamils” by which they were collectively known among the more ancient inhabitants of the Dekkan. The name Tamil appears to be therefore only an abbreviation of the word Tamalittis. The Tamraliptas are alluded to, along with the Kosalas and Odras, as inhabitants of Benga and the adjoining Sea-coast in the Vayu and Vishnu Puranas[28]\n\nThe oldest of the Mongolian tribes who invaded Southern India and conquered the Nagas appears to have been the Mârar, and the chief of this tribe was ever afterwards known as Palayan or “the ancient,’ being the most ancient, of the Tamil settlers in ​the Southern part of India.[29] The capital of Palayan Mâran was Mohoor, the exact site of which I am unable to ascertain. I, was somewhere close to the Pothiya Hill near Cape Comorin. The Pandyan King claimed to be a Maran and “Minavar Kon[30]\" or the King of the Minavar. The name Mâran appear to be identical with the name Mrânmar, borne by the tribe which conquered Burmah before the first century A.D. In the accounts of Burmah written in Pali, the country is known as Maramma-desa. [31]\n\nThe next tribe of Tamil invaders was the Thirayer o “Sea Kings.” They were a great seafaring race, whose home appears to have been Lower Bengal and who travelled by sea to Burmah, Cochin, China, Ceylon and Southern India. A King of this tribe named Thirayan who reigned at Kanchi, the modern Kanchi-puram contemporary with Karikal-Chola, claimed to be a descendant of the god Vishnu, whose bed is on the ocean, according to Hindu Mythology[32] It was on this account perhaps that the Chola Kings who belonged to this tribe, boasted of being descendants of the solar race. The oldest of the Chola Kings mentioned in the Tamil poems of the first century A. D. is Muchukunta. He is said to have saved Amaravati, the capital of Indra, when it was besieged by the Asuras, and that in gratitude for the service, Indra sent five giants who killed the Nagas of Kaviri-paddinam and enabled the Chola King to take possession of that town.[33]\n\n​The Tamil conquerors named the town Champâ-pati, most probaby after Champânagar, an ancient capital of Bengal (the site of which is near the modern town of Bhagalpur) fron which hey had emigrated.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that Muchukunta was the first Chola King who conquered the Nagas. The name of the Thiraiyar in Sanskrit was Sâgarakula. The ancient Kings of Thondainad belonged to the Sâgarakula, but the later Pallavas styled themselves Bhâradvajas.[34] Families of the Thirayar tribe who lived in Thondai-Mandalam (the modern Chingleput and North Arcot Districts) were known by the following names, as late as the sixteenth century A. D.[35]:-\n\nPangala Thirayar—Thirayar of Bengal.\n\nChina Thirayar—Thirayar of China, this was most probably Cochin China.\n\nKadara Thirayar—Thirayar of Kadaram, that is, Burmah.\n\nSingala Thirayar—Thirayar of Ceylon.\n\nPallava Thirayar—Thirayar of Pallavam.\n\nAnother tribe of the Tamils was the Vanavar or “Celestials\". They were evidently natives of a mountainous region in the North of Bengal, and when they settled in Southern India, they chose for their residence hilly tracts, such as the Kolli-hills (in the Salem District) the Western Ghats, and the Nilgiris. The Chera Kings belonged to this tribe and called themselves Vanavar or Celestials. They claimed affinity with the Vanavar inhabiting the Himalayas,[36] and expressive of their origin they adopted the titles of Vanavarmman or Imaya-Varmman.[37] Besides the Chera Kings, other mountain chiefs such as Nannan, lord of Muthiram[38] and Alumbil-Vel[39] called themselves ​Vana-Viral-Vel or Chiefs of the Vanavas. One of the Chera Kings called Chenkudduvan, who was contemporary with Gajabahu of Ceylon (113 to 105 A. D.) is said to have been on intimate terms of friendship with the Karnas, Emperors of Magadha, and with their assistance he attacked the Aryas near the Himalayas.[40] The Karnas, who belonged to the great Andhra tribe ruled Magadha during the first and second centuries of the Christian era. They were lords of the Three Kalingas, and their dominion extended from the modern Telugu country on the one side, to Arakan on the other side of the Bay of Bengal.[41]\n\nMr. Fergusson, the great writer on Architecture, having observed the striking similarity of the style of Architecture prevailing in South Canara and Malabar to that of Nepal, wrote as follows :— “The feature, however, which presents the greatest resemblance to the Northern styles is the reverse slope of the eaves above the verandah. I am not aware of its existence anywhere else South of Nepal, and it is so peculiar that it is much more likely to have been copied than reinvented. I cannot offer even a plausible, conjecture, how or at what time, a connection existed between Nepal and Thibet and Canara, but I cannot doubt that such was the case.” “In fact there are no two tribes in India, except the Nayars (of Malabar) and Newars (of Nepal) who have the same strange notions as to female chastity, and that ​coupled with the architecture and other peculiarities, seems to point to a similarity of race, which is both curious and interesting: but how and when the connection took place I must leave it to others to determine. I do not think there is any thing in the likeness of the names, but I do place faith in the similarity of their architecture combined with that of their manners and customs” (Mr. Fergusson’s History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, p.270 and 305). The similarity of races, which Mr. Fergusson’s professional instinct told him must be a fact, is fully borne out by the direct testimony of ancient Tamil poets. The connection between Nepal and Malabar had broken off probably more than two thousand years ago. It is truly marvellous therefore that traces of this connection still linger in the language, the customs, and the style of Architecture of the latter country, after the lapse of twenty centuries!\n\nThe three Tamil tribes Maranmar, Thirayar and Vanavar founded respectively the Tamil Kingdoms subsequently known as the Pandya, Chola and Chera Kingdoms.[42] From the edicts of the great Magadha Emperor Asoka. which were engraved in the latter half of the 3rd Century B.C., we learn that the three Tami’ kingdoms were in existence in his time and were not subject to his authority.[43]\n\nThe latest of the immigrants into the Tamil country were the Kosar. It is said that they attacked Mohoor the Capital of PalayanMaran and as they were repulsed there, the “Vamba-Moriyar” or the illegitimate Mauriyas came to their assistance, and drove in ​their handsome chariots on the Pothiya hill.[44] It appears therefore that the immigration of the Kosar took place in the 3rd or 2nd Century B.C., when the illegitimate Mauriyas were on the Magadha throne. The Kosar are said to have come from four different towns and they spoke four different dialects.[45] They were a very warlike people and were remarkable for their regard for truth.[46] In the first Century A. D., they were the Masters of the Konga country (the Modern Coimbatore District)[47] while in the Pandyan country they were the most honored of the subjects of the Pandya, inferior in rank only to Palayan-Maran.[48] They invaded Then-Pandi and the Chola territory also, but were repulsed by the Kings Thithiyan[49] and Killi.[50]\n\nThe Kosar appear to be no other than the Koshans, a branch of whom conquered Bactria in the second Century B.C. and the north-western portion of India, in the first Century B.C. They were the leaders of the four tribes of the Yuh-chi, i.e., the Asioi, Pasianoi, Tocharoi and Sakarauloi :[51] and their great god was Siva, as may be seen from the coins of Kanishka.[52]\n\nAs the Tamil immigrants came into Southern India at distant intervals of time and in separate tribes, and were fewer in number than the aboriginal Nagas and Dravidians, they had to adopt the ancient Dravidian language, and in course of time, they modified and refined it into the language now known as Tamil. The peculiar letter Rzha (ழ) found in the Tamil alphabet which does not occur in the other Dravidian or Sanskrit languages, was doubtless brought in by the Tamil immigrants. This letter, I understand, occurs only in some of the Thibetian languages. It indicates most clearly that the primitive home of the Tamil immigrants must have been in the Thibetian plateau. That they were not of Aryan descent ​is proved not only by the continued antagonism they displayed towards the Aryans, but also by ancient Sanscrit works in which the Dravidas are spoken of as an alien people.[53] That the Tamils had attained a high degree of civilization before the advent of the Aryans is established indisputably by the fact that the pure Tamil language is so copious and exact that it can do well without borrowing Sanscrit words. In fact, in the ancient Tamil classical works, the terms relating to Music, Grammar, Astronomy and even abstract Philosophy are of pure Tamil origin; and they indicate most clearly that those sciences were cultivated by the Tamils long before the arrival of the Brahmins or other Aryan immigrants. The Tamils obtained a knowledge of these sciences most probably from China, through Bengal or Burma, with both of which countries they had direct and constant intercourse. The Tamil language, unlike other Dravidian dialects, abounds in words with nasal letters such as nga, nja and nna: and this peculiarity is remarkable in ancient Tamil works, and in modern Malayalam. This is further evidence of the affinity of the Tamils and the Burmese and Chinese, the latter of whom call themselves “Celestials” like the ancient Cheras who were known as Vanavar or “Celestials” —\n\nThe modern Malayalam preserves, I believe, that form of language which was spoken by the early Tamil immigrants, some time after they had settled in Southern India. They had then learnt to use Dravidian words, but were not familiar with the personal signs of verbs. In this condition, the Malayalam of today resembles the Mongolian, the Manchu, and other primitive tongues of High Asia.\n\nThe early Tamil poets believed in the tradition that Agastya lead the first colony of the Aryas to the Pothya hills near Cape Comorin. How much of historical truth there is in this tradition it is difficult to determine; but the tradition seems to rest entirely on the Ramayana, in which epic, Agastya is represented as inviting Rama to overcome Ravana, the King of Ceylon. In the same poem ​Panchavati which was situated on the banks of the Godaveri near the modern Nasik is said to have been two yojanas from the hermitage of Agastya.[54] It follows therefore that during the time of Valmiki, Agastya’s hermitage was believed to be near the modern Nasik. Danda-karanya, the modern Mahratta country, as described as a forest infested by wild tribes who disturbed the religious rites of the Brahmins, while the country South of the river Kaviri is designated Janasthan, or a region inhabited by civilized people. In the passage describing the despatch of monkey soldiers in search of Sita, they are directed to go to the countries of the Andhras, the Pandyas, the Cholas and the Keralas in the South, and are told that they will there see the gate of the city of the Pandyas adorned with gold and jewels[55] These descriptions in the Ramayana go to show that during Valmiki’s time, the Aryas had some knowledge of the Tamil people and considered them as a civilized nation, and that they knew the Pandyan capital to be a very wealthy city. Another Sanscrit author, Katyayana who wrote his aphorisms called Varthikas, to explain and supplement the grammatical Sutras of Panini, and who is popularly known to have lived during the time of the Nandas in the first half of the fourth Century B. C., allules to the Pandyas and Cholas and says that one sprang from an individual of the tribes of the Pandas, or the Kings of their country, should be called a Pandya.”[56]\n\nIt is beyond doubt therefore that long before the fourth Century B. C. the Pandyan Kingdom in the South of India had come into existence. But of the founder of the Southern Pandyan kingdom nothing definite is known. According to the Mahabharata current in South India, Arjuna is said to have married Chitrangada, the daughter of Malayadhvaja, King of Pandya. But as the section containing this account is not to found in copies of the poem which are current in Northern India, it is doubtless an interpolation.[57] From other accounts however it ​appears that the founder of the Southern Pandyan Kingdom was a princess. Megasthenes who resided as an ambassador of Seleukus in the Court of Chandragupta at Pataliputra, has the following account of the origin of the Pandyas: “Herakles begat a daughter in India whom he called Pandaia. To her he assigned that portion of India which lies to southward and extends to the sea, while he distributed the people subject to her rule into three hundred and sixty-five villages, giving orders that one village should each day bring to the treasury the royal tribute, so that the Queen might always have the assistance of the men whose turn it was to pay the tribute, in coercing those who for the time being were defaulters in their payments.”[58] Pliny gives a similar account, “next come the Pandœ the only race in India ruled by women. They say that Hercules having but one daughter, who was on that account all the more beloved, endowed ier with noble kingdom. Her descendants rule over 300 cities and command an army of 150,000 foot and 500 elephants.”[59] Ancient Tamil poems seem to support this tradition because they refer to woman as the founder of the Pandyan Dynasty.[60] She appears to have been subsequently worshipped as a goddess in Madura. In the Chilappathikaram she is spoken of as Mathurapathi or “Queen of Madura” and she is described as dressed half in the attire of a warrior and half in that of a prin- ​cess.[61] The Manimekalai also alludes to her as Mathurâpathi.[62] Taking together the tradition as reported by Megasthenes and Pliny and the allusions in ancient Tamil works, it appears that a princess who belonged to the race of the Pandus, then reigning at Mathura on the banks of the Jumna, led a colony and founded Dakshina-Mathura on the banks of the Vaigai. Like Dido, who fled from Phœnicia and founded Carthage, it is most probable that the princess was driven by some domestic affliction to settle in a distant land. The later traditionary accounts speak of this princess as a woman born with three breasts. It is quite possible that owing to this personal deformity she as obliged to seek a husband in a foreign country. She appears to have married a king of the Marar tribe, which was already settled in the Tamil country, and hence her descendants assumed the titles of Pandyan and Maran.\n\nThe few Aryas who accompanied the Pandyan princess appear to have merged in the Tamil people by inter-marriages with them. The Pandyan Kings of the first and second century A. D. considered themselves as Tamils, and not Aryas, although they claimed descent from the Pandus. Not only the Pandyas, but also the Cholas and Cheras of this period considered themselves as rivals to the Aryas. Reference is made to frequent collisions between the Tamil Kings and the Aryas, in which the latter were defeated. One of the Pandyan Kings had the title Ariyappadai-Kadanta- Nedunj Cheliyan, which meant that he had defeated an Aryan army.[63] A Chola King is said to have routed the Aryas in a battle at Vallam (near the modern Tanjore.)[64] The Chera king Chenkudduvan defeated the Aryas on the northern bank of the Ganges, with the assistance of the Karnas, princes of Magadha.[65] Although the Aryas did not settle in the Tamil country by force of arms, many Brahmin families appear to have come in, as peaceful settlers. There was a large colony of them around the Pothya hill, where they believed, the Vedic sage Agastya had resided. They did not mix freely with the natives of the soil ​but lived apart in gramums or villages, and in large towns, they resided together in separate streets. At Maduara, Thankal[66] and Vayanankodu[67] in the Pandyan Kingdom, at Vanji, Poraiyur,[68] Erakam[69] and Mankadu[70] in the Chera country and at Kavirippaddinam, Mulloor,[71] Avinankudi[72] and Chenkanam[73] in the territory of the Chola King, they resided in large numbers. They claimed to be of several gotras or clans, all of which traced their descent from two patriarchs reputed to be the sons of no less a personage than Brahma the creator himself.[74] Brahmans of the ancient family of Kapiyas are specially alluded to as residing in the Chera dominions.[75] The Brahmins as a rule never allowed dogs or fowls to enter their houses. They reared cows for the sake of their milk, parrots to amuse their women and children, and mangoose to kill the serpents which might intrude into their houses or gardens.[76] Their chief employment was to keep up the triple sacred fires in their homes, to perform yogas or sacrifices and to chant Vedic hymns. To the other castes they posed as ”heaven compellers.” They engaged as teachers occasionally Some of them were Tamil poets. Frequently they started on pilgrimage, when they went round the Pothia Hill, bathed in the sea at Cape Comorin and at the mouth of the Kaviri, and travelled to the banks of the Ganges. On these occasions, they wore leathern sandals to protect their feet; and carried an umbrella to save themselves from sun and rain, a water-pot suspended by a string and three staves tied together. It is interesting to note that elephant drivers spoke to the animals in Ariyam. The Dravidians used to catch wild elephants in pitfalls dug in the woods: but the Aryas introduced the ingenious method of decoying wild elephants, ​by tame female elephants. As astrologers they had rivals amongst the Dravidians. The Brahmins were called in Tamil Pârppâr or “Seers” and the Dravidian astrologers were called Arivar or “Sages.”[77] These sages like the Brahmins pretended to read the future by consulting the positions of the heavenly bodies and fixed auspicious times for celebrating marriages or other important domestic and public ceremonies.\n\nThe Ayar or the cowherd race was distinct from the other races above mentioned. Their name Ayar is derived from the Dravidian word Â meaning a cow. They were known as the Abhiras in Puranic history. In northern India they are still called Ahirs. In the Tamil land they were also called the Pothuvar or Commons (from the Dravidian word Pothu meaning common) apparently because they professed friendship to the Nagas and Tamils alike. Originally they appear to have had their own petty Kings, in the Chola country, but Karikal-Chola is said to have exterminated their line of kings.[78] The Ayar in the Pandyan dominion had a tradition that they came into the Tamil land, along, with, the founder of the Pandyan family.[79] They worshipped ordinarily the Yakshas.[80] Their favorite deity was however their national hero Krishna whose liaisons with shepherd girls and feats celebrated in the Mahaharata formed the theme of their festive songs. The shepherd lads and lasses who resided in Madura are represented as personating in their dances Krishna and his brother Bala.Rama, Asothai the mother of Krishna and his wife Pinnay.[81] They were familiar with all the legends regarding the boyish freaks of Krishna, who stole the butter churned by the shepherdesses, and concealed their clothes, while they bathed and sported in the Jumna. They had a peculiar custom among them of selecting husbands for their girls from the victors of a bull-fight.[82] A large area of ground is enclosed with palisades and strong fences. Into the enclosure are brought ferocious bulls ​with sharpened horns. On a spacious loft, overlooking the enclosure, stand the shepherd girls whom they intend to give away in marriage. The shepherd youths prepared for the fight, first pray to their gods whose images are placed under old banian or peepul trees or at watering places. Then they deck themselves with garlands made of the bright red flowers of the kânthal and the purple flowers of the kâya. At a signal given by the beating of drums, the youths leap into the enclosure and try to seize the bulls, which, frightened by the noise of the drums, are now ready to charge any one who approaches them. Each youth approaches a bull which he chooses to capture. But the bulls rush furiously with tails raised, heads bent down and horns levelled at their assailants. Some of the youths face the bulls boldly and seize their horns. Some jump aside and take hold of their tails. The more wary young men skilfully avoid the horns and clasping the neck cling to the animals till they force them to fall on the ground. Many a luckless youth is now thrown down. Some escape without a scratch, while others are trampled upon or gored by the bulls. Some though wounded and bleeding again spring on the bulls. A few who succeed in capturing the animals are declared, the victors of that day’s fight. The elders then announce that the bull fight is over. The wounded are carried out of the enclosure and attended to immediately; while the victors and the brideselect repair to an adjoining grove, and there forming into groups, dance joyously before preparing for their marriage.\n\nThe Jews appear to have visited the Western Coast in the early centuries of the Christian Era. They have a tradition that a large number of their nation came and settled in Malabar soon after the destruction of their temple at Jerusalem, which event took place in A. D. 68. There is no allusion however to the Jews in ancient Tamil literature. But the fact that they were settled in the Western Coast during the second century is established beyond a doubt by the ancient deeds engraved in copper, still in possession of the Jews and Syrian Christians of Malabar.[83] These deeds are written in ancient Tamil and in the archaic character known as Vaddeluttu or “round letters.” They ​have excited much interest, not only because of their antiquity, but because of the curious fact that by them the ancient Chera Kings conferred on the Jewish Colonies, certain privileges which those Colonies still possess to some extent. They have been more than once translated, and there has been much diversity of opinion regarding the dates assigned to them. The earliest of the deeds is dated in the 36th year opposite to the 2nd year, during the reign of Sri-Bhaskara Ravi-Varman. The expression “36 year opposite to the 2nd year” has been variously interpreted. One scholar understood the 2nd year, to refer to the Cycle of Parasu Rama, another took the 36th year to refer to the 60 years Cycle of Brihaspati.”[84] Neither of these Cycles are however applicable to all the deeds whose dates are given in double years. From the researches made by the Portuguese Missionary Beschi, who resided in Madura for forty years, it appears that the Cycle then used in Southern India was the Grahapparivirthi Cycle[85] of ​90 years. The Epoch of this Cycle occurs on the expiration of the 3078th year of the Kaliyuga, in 24 B. C. The years follow the ordinary Solar or Siderial reckoning. The concurrent Christian year for any year reckoned by the Cycle may readily be found by multiplying the number of the Cycle by 90 and adding the year and subtracting 24. Thus the 36th year of the 2nd Cycle is equal to 2x90+36—24 or 192 A. D. The deed of the Chera King Bhaskara-Ravi-Varman, which is dated in a year equivalent to 192 A. D., appears to be therefore the oldest of the copper plate inscriptions preserved in Southern India, and as such, it deserves to be carefully studied. To those students of history who place more faith in inscriptions than in ancient literature, this deed affords the most satisfactory evidence of the civilization of the Tamils in the second century A. D. The language of the deed being very old and obscure Tamil, and some of the terms used being obsolete, it is difficult to render it correctly into English, but I give below a translation of it conveying the meaning of the deed as close to the original as I can render it.\n\n“Health and prosperity!\n\nThe grant vouchsafed by the King of Kings His Majesty Sri-Bhaskara-Iravi-Varmmar, during his reign—may it last for many hundred thousand years! [86] - the 36th year against the 2nd year (Cycle), when he tarried at Muyirik-Kodu.\n\nWe have given to Joseph Rabban the principality of Anjuvannam, the (right to levy) tribute in money and in kind,[87] the revenue of Anjuvannam, the light by day, the spreading cloth, ​the palanquin, the umbrella, the Vaduca drum, the trumpet, the sandals for the feet, ornamental arches, awnings and presents carried on poles balanced on the shoulders, along with the 72 privileges of a nobleman.\n\nWe have exempted him from paying the land tax and water rate; and we have enacted with this copper deed that when the other inhabitants pay taxes to the Palace he shall not have to pay, when they receive (presents) he shall also receive.\n\nGiven to Joseph Rabban Lord of Anjuvannam and to his posterity, sons and daughters and nephews and sons-in-law as a heriditary grant. Prosperity!\n\nThus do I know Gôvardhana Mârthândan,\n\nLord of Vênâdu.\n\nThus do I know Kotai Sri-Kandan,\n\nLord of Vênavali.\n\nThus do I know Mâna Vêpala Mâna Viyan,\n\nLord of Erâla-Nâdu.\n\nThus do I know Rayâran Châttan,\n\nLord of Vslluvanâdu.\n\nThus do I know Kothai-Ravi,\n\nLord of Nedum-Purayur.\n\nThus do I know Mûrkhan Chattan,\n\nCommander of the Eastern Army.\n\nKandan of Great Thalacheri Kilway,\n\nthe Mountain Splitter.\n\nThe writing of Kelappa.”\n\nFrom this deed we learn that about the close of the 2nd century, the Tamil Settlements on the Malabar Coast extended beyond Thalaicheri (modern Tellicherry) in the north, and up to the foot of the ghauts in the east. The Chera Kingdom was divided into six or more provinces, the rulers of which aspired to the dignity of kings, and the Chera Monarch assumed the title of King of Kings or Emperor. The chieftains of the Provinces formed a sort of council to the King, and it was with their assent that any grant was made, or privileges conferred under royal sanction. It appears that a land tax and water cess were levied by the king throughout his dominions except in those parts where the landholders had been specially exempted. Tribute from local Chiefs to the Lord of each province was paid in money or in kind. It is curious to note that foreigners could use sandals or umbrellas or ride in ​palanquins, only with the permission of the King. Noblemen prided themselves on special privileges such as the cloth spread on the ground for them to walk upon, ornamental arches and awnings to be erected on the roads on which they travel, and the flourish of trumpets and drums to announce their arrival and departure. There were no less than seventy-two rights claimed by great landholders, but the nature of these rights does not appear from the deed."
