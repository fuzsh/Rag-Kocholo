        "text": "The mudaliars, pillais and gounders have a common ancestry which many people are not aware of. All the three so-called caste names were originally titles held by chieftains. These three groups actually belong to the “vellalar” community who were agricultural landlords and inhabitants of the “marutha nilam” (one of the five lands advocated by the sangam literature). It is said that pure tamilians should be able to trace their origin to any one of the five lands indicated by the sangam literature. The land marutham was inhabited mainly by two groups, the vellalas (agricultural landlords) and the pallalars (agricultural peasants). This land was a very fertile land with lots of agricultural fields. These facts can be verified by the ancient tamil poetry “mukkudal pallu” were the murthapalli (the elder pallar women) and illayapalli (the younger pallar women) along with the pallan (their pallar husband) make fun of the vellalar landlord. Later, during cultural diversification the vellalars started diversifying into small groups depending upon the geographical regions of tamilnadu in which they inhabited.\n\nThus, those of the “thondaimandalam” became the thondai mandala vellalas (mudaliars and few pillais). This area includes the present day chennai, chengalpet, kanchipuram, vellore, cuddalore, arcot, vadalore, thrivannamalai area were the vellala mudaliars (also called as arcot mudaliars) are the dominant community. Those who inhabited the chola (thiruchy, thanjavur, pudukottai area) and pandiya (madurai, thirunelvelli, thuthukudi, kanyakumari, nagerkovil area) mandalams became the shoziya vellalar (a modified version of the chola vellalar) and pandiya vellalar respectively. Both these communities have pillai as their surnames. The vellalas of the kongu mandalam were called as kongu vellalas (gounders or kounders). This area includes coimbatore, salem, pollaichi, udagamandalam and darmapuri were the kongu vella gounders are the dominant community. It’s also said that the pillai, menon and nair communities of kerala also belong to the vellalar community (the so-called chera vellalas). Even though 90% of the tamilian vellalas have pillai, mudaliar or gounder surnames it should be remembered that not all mudaliars, pillais and gounders are vellalas. The vice-versa is also true- thus sometimes some vellalas have other surnames like chettiar, nayakar, etc. Similarly the agamudaiya mudaliars and senguntha mudaliars who form a significant number among the thondaimandala mudaliars are strictly speaking non-vellalas.\n\nThe agamudaiyars actually belong to the “mukkulathore” community which also includes the kallars and maravars. These three communities (as the name mukulathore suggest-three communities) have devar has their surname. But latter the agamudaiyars (the most upward community among the three) slowly migrated towards the northern part of tamil nadu, settled there, changed their surname to mudaliars and mingled with the local vellala mudaliars. This fact is denoted by the proverb which says “Kallar maravar agamudaiyar mella mella vandu vellalar aanaray, vellala ahi mudaliar shonnaray”. Similarly, the senkunthars who actually belong to the weaver community who form a significant population in kancheepuram and tirupur-salem area started using mudaliar surname for obvious social upliftment and started marrying with the vellala mudaliars.\n\nToday the caste “thuluva vella mudaliars” includes the vellalas, agamudaiyars and sengunthars. Even today inter-marriage between the vellala mudaliars and non-vellala mudaliars is not accepted in very orthodox families. A small but significant population of mudaliars also exist in other areas other than the thondaimandalam like madurai, tirunelvelli, coimbatore, etc but most of them are actually emigrants from thodaimandalam area. Among the coimbatore gounders (even though the word generally refers to the kongu vallala gounders) other non-vella gounders also exist including the “vettuva gounders” or “vanniya gounders”. Even though both the vellala gounders and vanniya gounders share the same surnames they belong to a totally different communities and marriage between these two communities is forbidden by both of them. In general, among all the vellalas the kongu vellalas are unique and follow a totally different customs and traditions."
