In contradiction of the ethnographic record asserting the diminishing significance of ritual killing since the nineteenth century, sacrifices to tutelary deities that had long been abandoned are being reactivated or enacted for the first time. However, such a counter-intuitive surge in the popularity of sacrifices is occurring at a time when the very deities to whom they are dedicated are apparently losing their potency. This seeming paradox, this article proposes, is an implication of both the entrenchment of electoral democracy and the material transformations accompanying economic liberalization in rural Tamil Nadu. In an electoral democracy, the political significance of tutelary deities—and consequently their charisma—has diminished. Their productive valence however, as exemplified in ritual sacrifices, has become ever more resonant in India's post-liberalization milieu, with its heightened sense of opportunity but also competitiveness and uncertainty.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nModern Asian Studies , Volume 49 , Issue 3 , May 2015 , pp. 753 - 786\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X1400016X [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2015\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

However, there are significant differences between the Kallars of the drier upland tracts of Madurai and Ramnathapuram and those of the wetter lowland Thanjavur regions, who had converted to more orthodox, pacific, and prestigious Brahminical and Vellalar values. Unlike their more intractable brethren in Madurai, my informants, the Thanjavur Kallars, had become settled and prosperous agriculturalists. Access to land and reliable irrigation was the key to their pacification and prosperity and their portrayal as being more compliant. The Thanjavur Kallars, Louis Dumont has attested, ‘look with scorn on their Madurai brothers, whom they consider coarse and half-savage’: Dumont, L. (2000). A South Indian Subcaste: Social Organisation and Religion of the Pramalai Kallar, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, p. 14Google Scholar. Conversely, Karuppaiyan notes that the still recalcitrant Upland Kallars disdain the lowland Kallars’ dependence on Brahmin landlords and emulation of Brahminical values. Karuppaiyan, V. (1990).

Women married into a lineage are not even formally acknowledged by their marital lineage cult. Any rights they may have are only through their husbands and sons.\n\n12\n\n12 Similarly, at the start of the fishing season, the first big fish that is caught must be released back into the pond. This is considered part of the minis' share. Some of the fish from this first catch must also be cooked and presented (together with other offerings) as part of a feast in a worship ceremony dedicated to the minis. Ensuring first and foremost that the minis get their share of the best of the piscine harvest is believed to be critical to ensuring the success of future fishing endeavours.\n\n13\n\n13 Selby, M. and Peterson, I.

During their regular assemblies under the banyan tree next to the Pidari Amman Temple, the headmen come to decisions about the allocation and use of communal resources, the administration of Vaduvur's temples, and the sponsorship of public religious rituals as well as arbitration of disputes among the residents of Vaduvur. This mode of localized self-governance and statecraft was especially significant in this case because the Vaduvur nadu had been a sovereign body relatively free from the interference of centralized authorities such as the pre-colonial king as well as the colonial state.\n\n23\n\n23 This account is from a woman who lives near the Pidari Amman Temple and has done so for decades.\n\n24\n\n24 This is according to Kattaiyar Mannaiyar, a headman of the Vaduvur nadu polity.\n\n25\n\n25 Appadurai, A.

However, there is some evidence to suggest that the emboldened agency and political assertiveness of Dalits may very well have an opposite effect on the charisma of their own ‘fierce’ gods; see Mines, Fierce Gods.\n\n28\n\n28 The sacrifice season is over only three specific months of the Tamil calendar: December–January (Tai), April–May (Cittirai), and July–August (Aadi).\n\n29\n\n29 Viswanathan, S..

Just as they largely ignored the ban by continuing to conduct individual sacrificial worship (although they did abandon collective lineage sacrifices), they also largely ignored its repeal.\n\n32\n\n32 Clark-Deces, I.
