This document summarizes an article about a late 19th century peasant movement in southern India known as the anti-Kallar movement of 1896. The movement sought to evict the Kallar caste from hundreds of villages, viewing them as inherently thieving and predatory. Peasant assemblies organized to improve security by replacing Kallar watchmen with men from other castes and imposing economic sanctions on the Kallar. The movement temporarily halted crime and was seen as a unique example of peasants taking security into their own hands, though the state ultimately intervened against assembly leaders. The movement revealed the intersection of colonial racial stereotypes about castes with native notions of social differentiation and identity.",
