        "text": "Indian\n\nSouthern Indian ǀ South Asian\n\nIndian – Tanjore Kallar\n\nThanjavur, formerly known as Tanjore, is the name of both a large city and its larger district in the state of Tamil Nadu, which is located in the southeastern “rice bowl” of the Republic of India (U.S. Relations With India). Kallar and two other castes represent groups who are distinguished by traditional occupations, rather than by a specific bloodline. The Indian – Tanjore Kallar population represents 101 random individuals from the population of Tanjore Kallar who were sampled in 2002 by the Central Forensic Science laboratory in Kolkata, India.\n\nSamples were obtained by the DNA Typing Unit at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in West Bengal, and research was supported by a grant from the Bureau of Police Research & Development, under the government of India’s Ministry of Home Affairs. One researcher was assisted by a fellowship from India’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).\n\n[Population 262]\n\nThe India – Vanniyar also known as Palli, are a very large social group of people spread all across South India. The India – Vanniyar population represents 87 random individuals from the population of Vanniyar who were sampled in 2002 by the Central Forensic Science laboratory in Kolkata, India.\n\n[Population 358]\n\nThe Pallar people belong to the Dravidian stock of South India that long pre-dates the arrival of lighter-skinned Aryans from the North. India – Pallar represents 33 random individuals from the population of Pallar who were sampled in 2002 by the Central Forensic Science laboratory in Kolkata, India.\n\n[Population 359]\n\nThe Paraiyar people are another Dravidian ethnic group of South India. India – Paraiyar represents 21 random individuals from the population of Paraiyar who were sampled in 2002 by the Central Forensic Science laboratory in Kolkata, India.\n\n[Population 360]\n\nSource publication for the above populations: Genotype Profile for Thirteen Tetranucleotide Repeat Loci and Two Pentanucleotide Repeat Loci in Four Endogamous Tamil Population Groups of India, JFS, 2002, p1168-1173.\n\nThe India – Madras population data represent DNA samples from 103 unrelated individuals living in India’s southernmost state of Tamil Nadu, and its capital city of Chennai (formerly Madras) [Chennai]. Samples were obtained by the Dept. of Genetics in the Postgraduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, at the University of Madras.\n\nThe Tamil population has documented a 2,000-year history in this region. Because their cuisine, music, artwork, literature and a unique, folk version of Hinduism has survived intact throughout the centuries, Tamils have been called “the last surviving classical civilization on Earth.”\n\nSource publication: Allele Frequencies for the 13 STR Loci and the D1S80 Locus in a Tamil Population from Madras, India, JFS, 2001, 46, 1515-1517.\n\n[Population 62]\n\nThe India – Golla people are a middle-ranking caste group of Andhra Pradesh who speak a Dravidian language called Telugu. Traditionally, this population has been semi-nomadic sheep herders and they still practice strict caste endogamy (marriage within the same clan, people or kinship group). The India – Golla population data represent DNA samples from 65 unrelated individuals living in 30 villages in the Southern Andhra Pradesh region of India. Samples were obtained by the Anthropology and Human Genetics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta; by the Dept. of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati (Ohio) and the DNA Typing Unit at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Calcutta.\n\nSource publications: STR Data for the AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus Loci Among Golla Population of Southern Andhra Pradesh, India, JFS, 2001, p734-735.\n\n[Population 84]"
