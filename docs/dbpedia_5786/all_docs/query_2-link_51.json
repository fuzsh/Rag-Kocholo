Devaneyan , B.O.L. on the lines of general philological principles meet a longfelt want in Tamil. In my early days when I was engaging myself in the study of such English works as Arch Bishop Trench's Study of Words, Prof. Max Muller's Science of Language, Prof. Sayce's Comparative Philology etc., my attention turned to making a similar study of Tamil words. Dr. Caldwell's Comparative Study of Dravidian Languages opened up before me a vast and wonderful tract of Tamil knowledge then lay hidden even to great Tamil scholars. Still Caldwell's works as an incipient attempt in an unknown region could not be expected to treat exhaustively of all Tamil words. And this impelled me to write a Tamil Philology myself and publish even one or two essays of it in the first volume of my magazine Jnanasagaram. But I could not continue it, since my activities in other fields as religion, philosophy and literary history absorbed my whole attention. Still I was looking about whether any competent scholar would take up the subject; and I was gratified to a certain extent when Father Jnanaprakasar of Jaffna sent me his interesting work on Tamil Philology. The field being vast and extensive, I was looking forward to some more work on a comprehensive scale founded on ancient classical Tamil and am glad to say that Mr. Devaneyan has met my expectation almost wholly. Tamil scholars may safely rely on his careful treatment of the subject and I dare say they will be greatly benefited by a diligent perusal of his works. It is my humble\n\nopinion that in the Study of Tamil words Mr. Devaneyan stands pre->eminent and has few rivals. Further Mr. Devaneyan is an impressive teacher and an interesting lecturer as I had seen on several occasions when I had presided over the annual deliberations of Tamil Sangams to hear him speak to large audiences and engage their attention by flavouring his speech with wit and humour. As a painstaking research scholar I am confident he will bring name and fame to any institution that will engage his services. Pallavaram, 1949 (Sd.)

Importance of History History is the backbone of all arts and sciences. Every science is but an unbroken chain of facts and truths discovered or found by researchers and men of experience from time to time. While history, pure and simple, mainly narrates events stating the time, place, agency, aim and result of them, science generally records or describes only the results of events. Sciences may be divided into two kinds, viz., the dependent and the independent. Philology is a dependent science relying upon all others, the chief among them being History, Human Physiology, Psychology and Anthropology. As philology is at once descriptive, comparative and historical, it is impossible to study the science correctly, if any of the three aspects is dispensed with. It is highly regrettable, that this important science has deteriorated, of late, into Descriptive Linguistics in the Western countries after the time of Dr.Caldwell, as a result of divorcing History from it completely.\n\n2. The Nature of the History of Ancient Tamil Nadu The history of a country may exist either written or unwritten. Written history may be true or false or partially true. Unwritten history may be extinct or descriptive or narrative. As the Tamil nation (or for that matter the Dravidian race) is of Lemurian origin, and as all the pre->Aryan Tamil literature and the post->Vedic pre->Sangam works, with a few exceptions, have been destroyed the pre->Christian history of Tamil Nadu can only be of descriptive nature. The post->Christian history of Tamil Nadu has already been written fairly well by many historians and historiographers. The South Indian historians as a rule, acquit themselves admirably well in writing the post>Christian history of Tamil Nadu; but become entirely inactive and uninterested with regard to the pre->Christian history of the same, and suddenly turn to the North and base everything on the Vedas. They are even prone to grossly misrepresent facts, as they know for certain that a true representation of ancient Tami Nadu will only reveal the glory of Tamil, and rebound to the credit of ancient Tamils. Their guiding principle is always to uphold Sanskrit and the Vedic system of culture. The two exceptions in this regard were the late Mr.P.T. Srinivasa Iyengar and Prof.V.R.Ramachandra Dikshitar, both of whom adorned the University of Madras as Head of the Department of History during different periods. If there was any other, it was T.R. Sesha\n\nIyengar. All the others are of one mould and flagrantly betray their bias towards Sanskrit. They make a mountain of a molehill if it be in favour of the Aryans, and a molehill of a mountain if it be in favour of the Tamilians. Under these circumstances, to expect a true and faithful history of pre->Aryan Tamil Nadu to be written by any of the pro->Sanskrit historians of today, is “to set the fox to keep the geese.” 3. The Sources of Cultural History of Ancient Tamils Tamil being the earliest cultivated language of the world dating from time immemorial and Lemuria, the original home of the Tamilians, having been submerged long ago, it is vain to look for archaeological evidences in support of the antiquity of Tamil civilization and culture. It must be definitely understood, that oceanography and geology have taken the place of archaeology in the case of Tamil Nadu. Under this situation, the Tamil language and literature alone consitute the sources of material for reconstruction of pre->Christian and pre->Aryan history of Tamil Culture. 4. Signification of the Term 'Tamil' ‘Tamil’ is one of those words whose origin and root->meaning are wrapped up in mystery. All that we can say at present without any fear of contradiction is, that it is a pure Tamil word being current as the only name of the language of the Tamils, from the days that preceded the First Tamil Academy established at Thenmadurai on the river pahṟuḷi in the submerged continent. After some of the Vedic Aryans migrated to the South, Tamil got the descriptive name ‘Tenmoḷi’ lit. ‘the southern language’, in contradistinction to the Vedic language or Sanskrit which was called ‘Vadamoḷi’, lit. ‘the northern language’. The word ‘Tamil’ or ‘Tamilan’ successively changed into ‘Dramila’, ‘Dramiḷa’, ‘Dramida’ and ‘Dravida’ in North India and at first denoted only the Tamil language, as all the other Dravidian dialects separated themselves from Tamil or came into prominence one by one only after the dawn of the Christian era. That is why Sanskrit and Tamil came to be known as Vadamoi and Teṉmoli respectively. This distinction could have arisen only when there were two languages standing side by side, one in the North and the other in the South, both coming in contact with each other. The Buddhist Tamil Academy which flourished in the 5th century at Madurai, went by the name of ‘Trāvida Sangam’. Piḷḷai->lōkācāriyar, a Vaiṣ->ava Acārya of the 14th century refers to Tamil literature as ‘Drāvida Sāstram’. Even Tāyumāṉavar a Tamilian saint who lived in the 18th century, employs the word ‘Trāvidam’ to designate Tamil, on account of the established usage of the term in religious literature. Telugu was the first Dravidian dialect to separate from Tamil, and so, Kumārila->Bhaṭṭa, an eminent Brahmin writer of the 7th century A.D., uses the term Andhra->Drāvida->bhāshā, ‘the Telugu->Tamil language’ for the first time to designate the entire family of the Dravidian languages. Whether the initial letter is voiced or voiceless, we do not find an ‘r’ inserted after it in any of the various forms of the word ‘Tamil’ employed by foreigners, as in those used by North>Indians or Sanskritists. In the Indian segment of the Peutinger Tables, we find the names Damirice and Dymirice, and in the Cosmography of the geographer of Ravenna, the name\n\nDimirica. We can safely identify these names with Tamilakam, by which name the Tamil country was generally known in ancient days. The Chinese pilgrim, Hwen Thsang has the form Tchi>mo->lo, which may also be read Dimala or Dimara. There is no difficulty in identifying this word with the name Tamil. The name given to Tamil by the first Danish Missionaries was Lingua Damulica, which may mean the Tamil language or ‘the language of the Tamil country’. In the Pāli of the Mahawanso the form used is Damilo, the derivative of which is Dāmilo. Tamil was written ‘Tamul’ and the Dravidian family of languages styled ‘Tamulian’ at one time by European writers. The oldest form of Dravida appears to have been Dramila or Dramiḷa. The Dravidas are called Dramilas in Tāranātha's Tibetan “History of the Propagation of Buddhism in India” (A.D.1573) and this is the form in which the word occurs again and again in the old Malayalam versions of the Sanskrit Purā->as. The next old form that appears to have been most widely in use is Dramida, which by a single consonantal change becomes Dravida. It is apparent that the form Dramila is closest to the word Tamil. Sanskrit has a tendency either to separate the consonant and vowel of the initial syllabic>consonant of a word and insert an ‘r’ between them, or to de->vowelise the syllabic>consonant and insert a ‘ ṟi’ after it, when naturalising Tamil words. e.g.\n\ne.g. Tamil\n\nSanskrit\n\nTamil\n\nSanskrit\n\npadi\n\nprati\n\npudavi\n\npṟithvi\n\npadimai\n\npratimā\n\nmadi\n\nmṟi\n\npadikam\n\npratika\n\nmadangam\n\nmṟidaṅga\n\npavalam\n\npravāḷa\n\nmedu\n\nmridu\n\nIt is exactly in keeping with this tendency that the word Tamil first became Dramila in Sanskrit. If we take all the Sanskrit alterations of the word Tamil in their historical order, there will be no difficulty at all in identifying the word Dravida with Tamil. Dr.Caldwell has rightly discovered their identity, but has gravely erred in deriving the original from its corruption, i.e., ‘Tamil’ from ‘Dravida’. It is owing to this wrong conclusion that he has reversed the order of the Sanskrit forms of the word Tamil. Evidently he had no knowledge of the Sangam literature, and consequently no idea of the Lemurian origin of Tamil. The Vedic Aryans set foot on the Indian soil not before 2000 B.C. The first Tamil Academy seems to have flourished not later than 5000 B.C. when the language had no other name than Tamil. This chronology proves the preposterousness of Dr.Caldwell's conclusion. Even without chronological evidence it is easier to derive ‘Dravida’ from ‘Tamil’ than ‘Tamil’ from ‘Dravida,’ and hence the correction of the mistake by Dr.Grierson in his Linguistic Survey of India. It also naturally seems improbable and absurd on the face of it, that the highly civilized Tamilian people residing in the extreme south should remain for long wihout a name for their language or themselves and then be called by the Aryan immigrants, not by a Tamil but by a Sanskrit name.\n\nThe etymology of the word Tamil, as I have already stated at the outset, is not yet known. Some attribute to the word the meaning ‘that which singularly possesses the letter ‘l’, and some others ‘sweetness.’ Both of these do not hold water, as the former demands comparison with all the other languages of the world as a prerequisite, and the latter only expresses the high esteem in which the language is held by the people who speak it. The only way to sqeeze a plausible meaning out of the word is to treat it as a corruption of the compound word tam->il, which may mean either ‘one's house’ or ‘one's country’. Originally it may have been prefixed to moli as an epithet so that the whole may have meant ‘house->hold language’ or ‘language of homeland’, and denoted the refined speech of Tamil Nadu which differed from that of contiguous northern countries called moli peyar dēyam, ‘countries where the speech changed or was in the transitional stage’. Then, in course of time, the epithet itself may have come to denote the language, and gradually evolved into the present form Tamil. Mutation of 1 into l is not uncommon in derivation. Comp. māl->maḻai (cloud or rain, kal->kāḷ->kāḷ->kāl (blackness). “The word Tamil occurs in all the ancient Tamil classics as a common or generic name for the people and their language in India. The word is as old as the Tamil language and hence there is no need to derive it from foreign words like Dravida”.1 (1.D.I.P.58) Many do not know that the words ‘Tamil’ and ‘Dravida’ are different forms of one and the same vocable. The Concise Oxford Dictionary, which treats ‘Tamil’ as a native word, declares ‘Dravida’ to be a Sanskrit one and the name of a province of South India.\n\n5. Need for distinguishing Tamil from the other Dravidian languages Though the word Dravida is only an alteration or another form of the term Tamil, it gradually acquired the character of a doublet and came to be used as a generic appellation for all the South Indian languages, because of the essential and distinctive grammatical characteristics and a large number of primary roots which they possess in common. Therefore, Dr.Caldwell was perfectly right in adopting the term Dravidian, derived from ‘Dravida’, as a common name to designate the South Indian family of languages, leaving the word Tamil free to signify that which is distinctively Tamil and at the same time relieving the term ‘Dravidian’ of its ambiguity, as it was sometimes used in a restricted sense, as equivalent to ‘Tamil,’ for which purpose it was not suited after Tamil became the parent of one or more of the Dravidian languages. As Dr.Caldwell was a pioneer worker in the field of Dravidian philology, there was no need felt during his time for making distinction within the family itself between Tamil and the other languages. Now it has arisen for the following reasons.\n\n(1)\n\nAs a result of advanced studies and research in Dravidian philology, the pre->eminence or supremacy of Tamil is realised far more than in the time of Dr. Caldwell.\n\n(2)\n\nThe linguistic reorganisation of States in India has contributed linguistic distinction and consciousness.\n\nmuch to\n\n(3)\n\nTamil alone possesses a literature which is distinctively Dravidian original in design and execution.\n\n(4)\n\nThe attitude of Tamil towards Sanskrit is diametrically opposed the other Dravidian languages.\n\nand\n\nto that of\n\n(5)\n\nThe Non->Tamil Dravidian languages have been Aryanised and alienated from Tamil so far, that they have reached a point of no return.\n\n(6)\n\nPurity, which is the life and soul of Tamil, is almost unknown to the other Dravidian languages.\n\n(7)\n\nThe unique simplicity of Tamil phonology makes Tamil a class by itself.\n\nThe above differentiae warrant invention of a new term to designate Tamil and other Dravidian languages collectively, demoting the old term Dravidian to denote only the non->Tamil languages of the family. The word best suited for the purpose is Tamilican, derived from Tamilic, a term which has already been used by European writers in what appears to be substantially the same sense in which I propose to use its derivative. The derivation is simple and similar to that of ‘Dravidian’. As the Tamil language varied during its spread towards the north, its name also varied correspondingly, and hence, it is only proper that the varied forms should be designated by a varied name. Accordingly, of the two terms Tamilican and Dravidian, the former will be used as inclusive and the latter as exclusive of Tamil hereafter in this treatise. Though Modern Tamil seems to have much changed from Old or pre->Dravidian Tamil, still, it will not be far wrong to say that Tamil is the parent of the Dravidian languages. Even Dr. Caldwell, who held Tamil only as the eldest member of the Dravidian family of languages, has described Tamil as “probably the earliest cultivated, of the Dravidian languages>in many respects the representative language of the family”, “the oldest and most highly cultivated member of the family, and that which contains the largest proportion of the family, inheritance of forms and roots”, “the most copious and that which contains the largest portion and the richest variety of indubitably ancient forms” and that which furnishes most assistance “in the endeavour to ascertain the characteristics of the primitive Dravidian speech, from which the various existing dialects have divaricated.” Now it is eighty->seven years since the above passages were written. “Some of the author's conclusions as to the dates of the older books have been rendered obsolete by the researches of Indian scholars and by the investigations of the Government Archaeological Departments.” The Sangam classics which were unknown even to Tamil scholars during the time of Dr.Caldwell, and in some of which, the tradition “which speaks of a large continent which once existed contiguous to Southern India, and which was submerged by the ocean during a certain\n\ninundation not far removed from human recollection” is recorded, were brought to light only after his time. Recent researches in Dravidian philology show, that the relation of Tamil to the Dravidian languages is that of parent and not that of sister, as is ordinarily held by Western philologists. Hence, the distinction between Tamil and its allied languages is fully justified.\n\nTAMIL, THE BEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DRAVIDIAN FAMILY OF LANGUAGES (I) The Primitive Nature of the Dravidian form of Speech best preserved in Tamil\n\n(i)\n\nPhonological simplicity of Tamil\n\nThough Tamil is a classical language of the first order, its phonology consists of only thirty primary and three secondary sounds, most of them so simple as to be easily pronounced by infants, invalids and the decripit, as well as by valiant adults. Even this number can be reduced to 31, if two of the secondary sounds are taken to be mere allophones of the vowels ‘i’ and ‘u’, as they ought to be. Thus, it will be seen, that Tamil, phonologically speaking, is the simplest of the classical languages of the world.\n\n(ii)\n\nPurity of the Tamil vocabulary\n\n“The ancient or classical dialect of the Tamil language, called Shen->Tamil (Sen->Damiḻ) or correct Tamil, in which nearly all the literature has been written, contains exceedingly little Sanskrit; and differs from the colloquial dialect, or the language of prose, chiefly in the sedulous and jealous care with which it has rejected the use of Sanskrit derivatives and characters, and restricted itself to pure Ancient Dravidian sounds, forms and roots. So completely has this jealousy of Sanskrit pervaded the minds of the educated classes amongst the Tamilians, that a Tamil poetical composition is regarded as in accordance with good taste and worthy of being\n\ncalled classical, not in proportion to the amount of Sanskrit it contains, as would be the case in some other dialects, but in proportion of its freedom from Sanskrit! The speech of the very lowest classes of the people in the retired country districts accords to a considerable extent with the classical dialect in dispensing with Sanskrit derivatives. In every country it is in the poetry and in the speech of the peasantry that the ancient condition of the language is best studied. ... ... ... Even in prose compositions on religious subjects, in which a larger amount of Sanskrit is employed than in any other department of literature, the proportion of Sanskrit which has found its way into Tamil is not greater than the amount of Latin contained in corresponding compositions in English......................”1 (1.D.C.G Introduction pp 45->6)\n\nTamil\n\nMan .\n\nKan.\n\nTel.\n\nonṟu\n\noṇṇu\n\nondu\n\nondu okati oṇji oṇta ēṇd ro(ṇdi) uṇdi\n\n->->\n\nol\n\nnir\n\nniru\n\n->-> ->-> ->-> ->->\n\nyēr\n\ndir\n\nniḷ\n\n->->\n\nbā\n\nvali\n\nnīr\n\nTulu Kur Malto Kui\n\nvāy\n\nvāy\n\nbāy\n\nvāyi\n\n->-> bai\n\nvar,vā\n\nvā\n\nbā\n\nrā\n\nbā barā barā bāmu varā\n\nbar\n\nvaḷ\n\npō\n\npō\n\npōgu,pōgu\n\npōvu\n\n->-> ->-> ->-> ->->\n\n->->\n\n->->\n\npugu\n\nkalu\n\nlu\n\n->-> ->-> ->-> ->->\n\n->->\n\nk\n\nkal\n\nvalenu,vale ->-> ->-> ->-> ->->\n\n->->\n\n->->\n\nvēḷ\n\nkal(pḷ.sfx. ) vēṇdum\n\nvēṇam,ēṇam\n\n->-> ->->\n\nGondi Brahui Roots\n\n“Though the proportion of Sanskrit which we find to be contained in Tamil version of the Ten Commandments happens to correspond so exactly to the proportion of Latin contained in the English version, it would be an error to conclude that the Tamil language is as deeply indebted to Sanskrit as English is to Latin. Tamil can readily dispense with the greater part or the whole of its Sanskrit, and by dispensing with it rises to a purer and more refined style; whereas English cannot abandon its Latin without abandoning perspicuity. Anglo->Saxon has no synonyms of its own for many of the words it has borrowed from Latin; so that if it were obliged to dispense with them, it would, in most cases, be under the necessity of using a very awkward periphrasis instead of a single word. Tamil, on the other hand, is peculiarly rich in synonyms; and generally it is not through any real necessity, but from choice and the fashion of the age, that it makes use of Sanskrit... ...... Through the predominant influence of the religion of the Brahmans; the majority of the words expressive of religious ideas in actual use in modern Tamil are of Sanskrit origin, and though there are equivalent Dravidian words which are equally appropriate, and in some instances more so, such words have gradually become obsolete, and are now confined to the poetical dialect; so that the use of them in prose compositions would sound affected and pedantic. This is the real and only reason why Sanskrit derivatives are so generally used in Tamil religious compositions.”1 (1. Ibid pp 46->7)\n\nTamil, on account of its phonological simplicity and verbal richness, has a natural aversion to all foreign words, especially to Sanskrit ones, and in cases of unavoidable necessity naturalisation of foreign words, even to the extent of obliteration of identity, is an indispensable prerequisite, according to the orthodox tradition. Tamil is maintaining or is able to maintain its purity both glossarially and morphologically, even after the total extinction of the pre->Aryan Tamil literature and the submergence of the whole of ancient Pandinadu. Most of the words and inflexions in the Dravidian languages are either alterations or corruptions of the original forms which are treasured up only in Tamil. (iii) Earliest cultivation of Tamil Tolkāppiyam, which is mainly a recast of an earlier work, or compilation of materials collected from many earlier works and presupposes a long evolution of literary culture, was composed about the 7th century B.C.Literary tradition affirms that the First Academy which flourished more than 6000 years before Christ, both preserved earlier literature and produced new works exactly like its two successors. Though the periods of duration given for the Three Academies are incredibly long, the incredibility soon vanishes when we consider the aboriginality of the Tamilians, the high degree of linguistic and literary cultivation of Tamil and the geological antiquity to the Lemurian continent, in which the seats of the first two Academies were situated. “The relatively high antiquity of the literary cultivation of Tamil being a matter of interest considered in itself, irrespective f its bearings on the question of Dravidian comparative grammar, I shall here adduce a few of the evidences on which this conclusion rests.” “Classical Tamil, which not only contains all the refinements which the Tamil has received, but also exhibits to some extent the primitive condition of the language, differs more from the colloquial Tamil than the classical dialect of any other Dravidian idiom differs from its ordinary dialect.......... As the words and forms of classical Tamil cannot have been invented all at once by the poets, but must have come into use slowly and gradually, the degree in which colloquial Tamil has diverged from the poetical dialect, notwithstanding the slowness with which languages, like everything else, changes in the East, seems to me a proof of the high antiquity of the literary cultivation of Tamil.”1 “The higher antiquity of the literary cultivation of Tamil may also be inferred from Tamil inscriptions. In Karṇāṭaka and Telingāna, every inscription of an early date and the majority even of modern inscription are written in Sanskrit......... In the Tamil country, on the contrary, all inscriptions belonging to an early period are written in Tamil.......”2 “From the various particulars mentioned above, it appears clear that the Tamil language was of all the Dravidian idioms the earliest cultivated; it also appears highly probable that in the endeavour to ascertain the characteristics of the primitive Dravidian speech, from which the various existing dialects have divaricated, most assistance will be furnished by Tamil.”3 The literary cultivation of Kanarese, Telugu and Malayalam dates only from the 9th, 10th and 14th centuries A.D. respectively. (iii)\n\nThe extraordinary copiousness of the Tamil vocabulary\n\n“Another evidence of the greatness of Tamil” consists in the extraordinary copiousness of the Tamil vocabulary, and the\n\n1.D.C.G.Introduction,p.81 2.Ibid.pp.85&86 3.Ibid,p.87. number and variety of the grammatical forms of Shen->Tamil. The Shen->Tamil grammar is a crowded museum of obsolete forms, cast->off inflexions, and curious anamolies... Nothing strikes a Tamil scholar more, on examining the dictionaries of the other Dravidian dialects, than the pausity of their lists of synonyms in comparison with those of Tamil. The Tamil vocabulary contains not only those words which may be regarded as appropriate to the language, in as much as they are used by Tamil alone, but also those which may be considered as the property of Telugu, Canarese, &c. Thus, the word used for ‘house’in ordinary Tamil is vidu; but the vocabulary contains also, and occasionally uses, the word appropriate to Telugu, il (Tel. illu); and the distinctive Canarese word, manai (Can. mane); besides another synonym, kudi which it has in common with Sanskrit and the whole of the Finnish languages. The grammar and vocabulary of Tamil are thus to a considerable extent the common repository of Dravidian forms and roots. We may conclude, therefore, that the literary cultivation of Tamil dates from a period prior to that of the other idioms, and not long subsequent to the final breaking up of the language of the ancient Dravidians into dialects.”1 (iv)\n\nIndependence of the Tamil language and literature\n\n“The orientalists who supposed the Dravidian languages to be derived from Sanskrit were not aware of the existence of uncultivated languages of the Dravidian family, in which Sanskrit words were not at all, or but very rarely, employed; they were also not aware that some of the Dravidian languages which make use of Sanskrit derivatives, are able to dispense with those derivatives altogether, such derivatives being considered rather as luxuries or articles of finery than as necessaries. It is true it would now be difficult for Telugu to dispense with its Sanskrit; more so for Canarese; and most of all for Malayalam. Those languages having borrowed from Sanskrit so largely, and being so habituated to loop up to it for help, that it would be scarcely possible for them now to asset their independence. Tamil however, the\n\n1.D.C.G.Introduction,p.82. most highly cultivated ab intra of all Dravidian idioms, can dispense with its Sanskrit altogether, if need be, and not only stand alone, but flourish without its aid.”1 All the pre->Aryan Tamil literature, technical as well as general, displaying perfect, purity of word and thought, have been destroyed. Even the earliest extant Tamil literature is enough to prove the complete independence of Tamil language and literature from Sanskrit. The linking of the Tamil language, Music and Drama together as Muttamil, ‘threefold Tamil,’ the division of Grammar into Orthography, Accidence and Syntax, and that which comprises classification of literary themes Prosody and Rhetoric; the division of subject->matter into Aham (Erotic) and Puram (non->Erotic); the five fold geographical treatment of erotic poems as Kurinji (hill->side), Mullai (pastoral regioṅ, Marudam (agricultural regioṅ, Neydal (littoral), and Pālai (desert); the four principal metres, viz., Ve->bā, āsiriyappā, Kalippā and Vañjippā and their varieties, not to speak of the various allied and auxiliary metres; the eightfold classification of poetic works, each\n\nclass called by the common name Vanappu, into Ammai, Alagu, Toṉmai, Tōl, Virundu, Iyaibu, Pulaṉ, and Ilaibu; the 20 types of simple rhythm described by Tolkappiyam, the 100 types of complex rhythm described by Avinayam, and the numerous types of technical rhythm displayed by Arunagirinather; are all peculiar to Tamil. (v) Material for reconstruction of Ancient Dravidian History furnished by Tamil alone The traditional account of the Three Tamil Academies, the references to the river Pahṟuḷi (in Silappadikāram and Puṟam), the enumeration by Adiyārkkunallār of the 49 regions forming a great part of the submerged Pandiyanadu, short notices of some Pandiyas of the First Academy found in Tamil literature and the like, are, in the absence of a regular history, valuable materials for reconstructing the ancient history of the Dravidians, at least in very broad outlines, whereas there is nothing of the kind in all the literatures of the other Dravidian languages.\n\n1.Ibid,p.45.\n\n6. India Proper in the South (i) Geological anteriority of South India to the Himalayan region “Towards the close of the period of the Gondwana there was another earth movement in the history of South India, but the peninsula remained a solid block little affected by this movement. Subsequent to the formation of the Kurnool series, there is a wide blank which perhaps extended over millions of years in the geological history of South India. At the end of this period the Purā->a sea got linked up with the sea of Tethys which overspread North India, Tibet and China. South India formed a great part of the continental area known as the Gondwana land which extended through Madagascar and South Africa to South America on the one side and through Malaya Archipelago to Australia on the other. The lowermost beds of the Gondwana system are fixed by indirect evidence as upper carboniferous or permocarboniferous in age. “Rocks similar to the Gondwana system occur in Australia, South Africa, South America and Antarctica. It is believed that land connections existed between these regions across the Indian ocean, which linked with South America through India and the Malaya Archipelago to Australia. Zoology furnishes further proof that the fauna of India have marked affinities with those of Central Africa and Madagascar. Geology accepts the Indo->African land connection as a settled fact though there is a difference of opinion about the mode of continuity and of its geography. According to one school of thought the whole of the region that is now the Indian ocean and the area to the north of it was at the close of the Palaeozoic in Permo -> carboniferous times occupied by two separate masses of land, the great continent of ‘Angara’ with its Gigantopteris type of flora and secondly the continent of Gondwana characterised by Glossopteris flora extending from Australia through peninsular India to South Africa on to South America. Between these two continents ran a comparatively narrow sea, which perhaps united the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This seems to have persisted till the commencement of the Cainozoic era, when large segments of it are supposed to have subsided to form the Bay of Bengal, Arabian sea etc., thus isolating the peninsula of India.1\n\n(ii) Pre->Aryan Indian Culture still preserved in the South “Attention has been concentrated too long on the North, on Sanskrit books, and on Indo>Aryan notions. It is time that due regard should be paid to the non->Aryan element. “This book being deliberately confined almost exclusively to the summary presentation of the political history of India, I am precluded from following out the suggested line of research, but I cannot refrain from quoting certain observations of an eminent Indian Scholar, prematurely deceased, which seem to me worthy of serious consideration, and are as follows: ‘India Proper in the South’ “‘The attempt to find the basic element of Hindu civilization by a study of Sanskrit and the history of Sanskrit in Upper India is to begin the problem at its worst end and most complicated point. India, south of the Vindhyas -> the Peninsular India -> still continues to be India Proper.\n\nHere the bulk of the people continue distinctly to retain their pre->Aryan features, their pre>Aryan languages, their pre->Aryan social institutions. Even here the process of Aryanization has gone indeed too far to leave it easy for the historian to distinguish the native warp from the foreign woof. But, if there is anywhere any chance of such successful disentanglement, it is in the South; and the farther South we go the larger does the chance grow. “The Scientific historian of India, then, ought to begin his study with the basin of the Krishna, of the Cauvery, of the Vaigai, rather than with the Gangetic Plain, as it has been now long, too long, the fashion. “When the ideal Early History of India, including institutions as well as political vicissitudes comes to be written on a large scale, it may be that the hints given by the learned Professor will be acted on, and that the historian will begin with the South.”2\n\n1.P.S.I.p.p 2.E.H.I.Introduction,p.8\n\n7. “The Tamils, indigenous to South India”\n\n“If the culture of a people is indigenous to the soil on which they live, if it appears to have grown in situ before they came in contact with other people, it must be solely due to the influence of their physical surroundings. A culture that has grown as the reaction of a people to their milieu is due to geographical and not historical causes, like the influence of foreign people who have come in touch with them by conquest or trade or other forms of peaceful intercourse. We are in a position to trace the growth of human culture in Tamil India, from stage to stage, in ancient times, the action of the physical environment on the human organism. Several writers of Indian History seem to hold it is a necessary axiom that the fertile lands of India, with her wonderful wealth of minerals underground and her infinitely various fauna and flora overground, and with her climate, insular in some parts and continental in others, pre->eminently fitted to nurture men, especially in the early stages of their evolution, should yet depend on importations from the aried countries beyond her borders for her human inhabitants and for the various cultures that adorn the pages of her history. Some writers conduct the ancient “Dravidians” with the self->confidence of a Cooke's guide through the North->western or North->eastern mountain passes of India and drop them with a ready->made foreign culture on the banks of the Kaviri or Vaigai. The slender evidence on which they rely for this elaborate theorizing is the fact that Brāhui, a dialect spoken in the northern corner of India possesses a few words allied to Tamil words. The only legitimate inference from this is that the Tamil language or a language allied to it prevailed up to the North->west province in ancient times. This inference is supported by another fact, viz., that the modern dialects of Northern India now called Sanskritic or Guadian, have a fundamental grammatical framework and a Scheme of Syntax, the same as that of the\n\nDravidian dialects, so much so that sentences from the one set of the Dravidian dialects can be translated into any one of the other set of dialects by the substitution of word for word, without causing any breach of idiom. These facts can only prove that people speaking dialects allied to Tamil once inhabited the whole of India and not that these people must necessarily have come into India from outside the country. No single fact has yet been adduced that compels us to believe that the ancient people of India were not autochthones. “Moreover, the artefacts and other relics of ancient times discovered so far in Southern India form an unbroken series, showing that there has been in this country a regular evolution of culture, which was never rendered discontinuous by any catastrophe, from the lowest palaeolithic stage to the latest age of metals. The Tamil language existed in South India during the course of this evolution. The words necessary for the linguistic expression of every stage of this culture, are found in the earliest strata of Tamil, and the customs of these early ages continued sufficiently long to be enshrined in the earliest extant specimens of Tamil literature. It may therefore be taken as fairly certain that the Tamils were indigenous to South India.”1 “The Theory of the Pre->Dravidians and Proto->Dravidians is a myth of the 20th century. Neither the archaeologist nor the historian of South India could furnish tangible proof of a displacement of peoples and of culture from one age to the other either by a catastrophe or other causes. On the other hand, there is everything in favour of continuity of paleolithic culture passing peacefully to neolithic, the neolithic to iron culture. The archaeological finds clearly indicate a regular progress of culture. It is wrong to say that the jungle and hill tribes are ethnically different from the Dravidians of South India as we understand by the term today. Students of the Anthropogeography of the Deccan know that five types of culture persisted in this land since the Neolithic times. Of these, the types of peoples who embraced hunting and fishing are the earliest, belonging to the lowest Paleolithic Age. Continuous living down the ages in forest and coastal regions respectively has resulted in their developing peculiar modes of life and mental habits. The question of pigmentation need not disturb us; for it is to be attributed to the climatic environment and to some extent the nature of occupation pursued. The introduction and extension of agriculture could not and should not mean abandonment of primitive economic pursuits. Men placed in a certain environment plied their old trade and kept up their standards of living and habits of life. The other types of culture were represented by the agricultural communities, Vellalar and Karalar, and pastoral communities like the āyar whose profession was the preservation of cattle.\n\n1.H.T,pp.1->3 The Pālai or desert type became merged in the Kurinji or hill tribes, for there was no Pālai territory in the Tamil land. The animal culture was fixed in unchanging social types; hunters and fishermen, agriculturists and shepherds. So, the jungle and hill tribes of the littoral region cannot be treated as Pre->Dravidian nor the Mediterranean and Armenoids as Proto->Dravidian. We therefore conclude that the so->called Mediterranean race has its origin in Peninsular India, which was a part of the original Dravidian home which was in the submerged continent that connected South India with Africa, when the Indo->Gangetic Basin had not probably been formed.”1\n\n“The five sub->divisions of the habitable regions occur contiguous to each other and in a small fraction of the earth's surface in India south of the Vindhyas. It is therefore easy to understand how increase of population and alterations in the natural supply of food->stuffs brought about here at different periods the migration of men from region to region and the consequent development of the different stages of human culture, the hunter, the nomad, the pastoral, the coastal, and the agricultural due to the differing stimuli provided by the changing milieu; in other words, the geographical control of the growth of human civilization can be worked out and set forth clear as on a map by a study of man's progress in this restricted portion of the surface of the earth. Outside India these five natural regions occur on a vast scale, e.g., the Mullai, the vast steppe land extending from the Carpathians to the foot hills of the Altais, the Kuṟ iñji or the great mountain chain from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas and beyond, forming the grand girdle round the waist of mother earth, the Neydal, the coasts of the Mediterranean sea, and the Indian and the Atlantic oceans, and the Pālai, the great desert of Sahara and its continuation in Arabia, Persia and Mongolia.”1 “Thus it may be seen that the South Indian people whom we designate Dravidians are descendants of the Neolithic peoples with a distinct culture and civilizations maintaining their individuality through the ages...........They were an indigenous people and not foreign to the land of Southern India.\n\n1.O.S.T.pp.28&29\n\nThe colloquial dialect of Tamil best spoken at the Southern extremity of Tamil Nadu (1) The primitive pronunciation best preserved in the peasant dialect of Thirunelveli It is in the speech of the peasants of Thirunelveli, that we find the pronunciation of Tamil sounds best preserved in the original form. They are not able to reproduce voiced and aspirate sounds, even if they are repeated a good number of times. They pronounce ‘jāti’ as ‘sādi’, and ‘sākṣi(ṅ’ as ‘sākki’, exactly in accordance with the rules laid down in Naṉṉūl for Tamilisation of Sanskrit sounds, though they are not aware of them. Even voiceless unaspirates are not as hard in their utterance, as in the Sanskrit language. This kind of situation is undoubtedly due to their close proximity to the place where the original home of the Tamil existed, and to the circumstances of their being comparatively free from Aryan influences. (2) The richness and purity of the Thirunelveli dialect Though provincialism is a common feature of all the Tamil districts, there is no rival to the southern most of them viz., Thirunelveli, in the matter of dialectic richness and purity as is evidenced by the following sets of words: (i) Evidence of richness ilakku, a fixed place. iṟangoṟṟi, usufructuary mortgage of land. ūruṇi, orig, drinking->water tank kāmbu->dal, to become insipid, as long->kept food->stuff nin, thou,\n\ntakkanai, a fitting recompense. vālvarasi, married woman living with her husband in prosperity. There are four processes involved in the act of winnowing and shifting grain, viz., nāvu->dal, koli->ttal, pudai->ttal and teḷḷudal. All these four are called by the appropriate names in Thirunelveli. But in the northern and midland districts, they are collectively signified by the verb nēmbu->dal or nōmbu->dal both being altered forms of ‘nāvu->dal’.\n\n1.H.T,p.14 In Thirunelveli urumam. uccivēḷai tavasam tuppuravu paṇṇaiyār pagudi midivaṇdi vangi\n\nEvidence of purity In the northern districts madhyānam (S.) dhānyam (S.) ṟuddham (S.) mirasidār (U.) kist (U.) cycle (E.) bichwā (U.)\n\nThere are also some physical features and agricultural products peculiar to Thirunelveli, whose names enhance the richness of its dialect. e. g-> tēri, a sand hill. kāyal, a lagoon. kādaikkaṇṇi,a kind of millet having the colour of quail's eye. kudiraivāli, horse->tail millet: These cereals are grown in the adjoining districts also, to some extent, but never in the northern and midland districts. The peasant dialect of Thirunelveli is also noted for its extraordinary richness in idioms, words in pairs and beautiful proverbs. Permanent record of primitive conditions of living preserved through Tamil literary convention There is a peculiar system of describing things, technically called Pulaneṟi Va ḷakkam, adopted in Tamil from the very beginning, in erotic literature, in accordance with a set of stereotyped principles, and it is owing to this literary convention that we are able to get a few glimpses of the living conditions of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Tamilians, even at this distance of time.\n\n(1) The earliest picture we get from Tamil literature of the conditions of living of primitive Tamils, is that each of the five geographical regions into which Tamil Nadu is naturally divided, was inhabited by a single tribe following a distinct pursuit in accordance with the natural surroundings as the hilly region by hunters, the desert region by depredators, the pastoral region by cowherds and shepherds, the agricultural region by farmers and the littoral region by fishermen. This kind of situation was undoubtedly prior to the evolution of urban society, and is indicative at once of the antiquity and indigenous nature of the Tamil or Dravidian race. The preposterousness of the notion that the Dravidians, driven from their North Indian Home by the Aryans, separated themselves into the five geographical classes in South India or in the Lemurian continent, needs no mention. (2) The common order in which the five geographical tracts are enumerated, makes us infer that the primitive Tamilians, who originally inhabited mountain regions, spread from one region to another following the courses of big rivers up to the sea, as population increased and civilization advanced. The ancient Tamils observed not only that the land surface of the earth consisted of five natural regions, but that the manifestation of human life corresponded to the characteristics of the milieu in which each tribe has grown. The five regions were called (1) Kuṟiñji, the hilly country, (2) Pālai the dry waterless region, (3) Mullai, the pastoral land between the highlands and the lowlands, (4) Marudam the lower courses of rivers; and (5) Neydal, the littoral tract, that which skirts the sea. All these five kinds of natural regions are found in the Tamil country, though on a small scale, and the Lemurian Tamils spread from region to region, as they developed the stages of culture which each region was calculated to produce. “........... The states of culture through which man has passed are then five, the hunter, the nomad, the pastoral, the littoral and the agricultural, the last including the industrial stage...... The Physical characteristics of each region provided the development of the special culture of that region.”1 (3) The various forms of address by which the hero is addressed by the heroine's confidantee, in an amatory poem, as Silamba! (O Lord of the hill.), Ura! (O Lord of the agricultural town), Tuṟaiva! (O Lord of the seacoast town) and so on, remind us of a period when State organization had not reached beyond the city stage in Tamil Nadu. (4) In all erotic poems coming under the category of Agam, the lovers described are imaginary characters or ideal type. Every erotic poem, mentioning the proper name of a lover, whether real or imaginary, is treated as belonging to the category of Puṟam. It is prescribed indirectly, that the presentation of a gift by a lover to his sweetheart before their clandestine union, should be represented as that of a leafy attire (however advanced the Tamil country may be in textile and tailoring industries). The theme of presentation of a leafy attire takes us far back to a period of immemorial antiquity, as the art of weaving is now ascertained to be Stone Age old.\n\nThe geographical and climatic conditions of Tamil Nadu portrayed in ancient Tamil literature still chracteristic of South India The characteristic physical features and geographical conditions of the five tracts into which Tamil Nadu is naturally divided, are still the same as those described in ancient Tamil literature, allowance being made for the later->day social and religious developments, the consequent living side by side of the geographical classes and professional communities in the same locality in the rural areas as well as in the urban districts, and the reaching of the influence of modern civilization deep into the retired districts. The particulars of geographical features of ancient Tamil Nadu are as follows:\n\n1.H.T.p.4 (1) Hilly region Human habitation : Siṟukudi (hamlet) and Kuṟicci (hill->side village).

There is nothing in Tamil to answer to the cold regions of the Asiatic table->land, to the ice->bound polar plains or to the vine growing fig->shadowed Chaldean regions. Animals like the elephant or the tiger, birds like the peacock or the parrot, grains like thiṉai (Italicum panicum) and varahu (Paspalum frumentaceum), and trees like vēngai (kino->tree) are characteristic of the Tamil hills and plains, and not indigenous to any country outside India. Greece, Syria and Babylon were ringing with the fame of Tamilagam in ancient times, and came to her for teaks and sandals, her pearls and muslins and her peacocks and pepper. The earliest Tamil works describe the physical features of the semi->pastoral Tamil people and their life in Tamil India so accurately and lovingly that their love for and intimate acquaintance with Tamilagam is apparent in every verse. The Tamil land is invariably divided by all the early poets into its five most natural divisions (aindiṇai). The special features and peculiar genius of Tamil literature, which accurately photographed the characteristics of the Tamils, arrested the attention of the Aryans with the result that the latter seriously commenced studying all about the Tamils and their culture even in the early centuries of the Christian era. That Kapilar, a member of the Third Academy at Madura, composed a whole poem entitled Kuṟiñjipāṭṭu to impart to the Aryan Prince Brahathathan all about the life of the Tamils and the fauna and flora of the Tamil country is well known. The Tamils always believed that from the outset they were the aboriginal inhabitants of the great territories bounded by the two seas on the east and west, and by the Vēṅkata hills on the north, and the submerged rivers, Pahṟuḷi and Kumari on the South”.1\n\n1.D.I,pp.56->8\n\nCommonness of languages of the five geographical tribes of Primitive Tamil Nadu Though the population of primitive Tamil Nadu was divided into five geographical classes, they were not heterogeneous tribes speaking different languages like those of Africa, Australia and America, but constituted one homogeneous race having Tamil as their common language, differing only in technical terms and standard of verbal richness, in accordance with the stage of civilization they had reached. The consolidation of the five geographical dialects into one major language was effected only at a later stage when Kingship was instituted. The application of the maxim ‘Community of language is a sign of community of descent’ in regard to the primitive Tamilians, is not hindered by any historical consideration. Archaeological evidences of the unbroken history of the primitive Tamils in the South “Throughout South India there is no geological or other indication of catastrophic phenomena when the Palaeolithic Age ended; in several places Palaeolithic settlements shade off gradually into Neolithic ones. Hence it is safer to conclude that the Neolithic Epoch came as a result of gradual evolution from the preceding age. The substitution of trap->rock for quartzite, the acquisition of the skill to polish the tools made with trap->rock till they become extraodinarily smooth to the touch, the domestication of the wild dog, and the cultivation of the wild rice led to the peaceful evolution of the epoch of new stone tools from that of the older rough implements, the settled life of the Neolithians from the nomad life of the Palaeolithians.” “........ A careful study of South Indian prehistoric antiquities in situ cannot lead to any other conclusion than that the passage of culture from stage to stage in ancient times was not a catastrophic change such as indicates the struggle of alien intruders with the pre->existing population but a peaceful course of evolution.” “........An examination of several Neolithic sites proves that the passage from the Lithic to the Iron Age was not catastrophic but that the two ages overlapped everywhere, stone tools continued to be used long after iron tools were made, more especially on ceremonial occasions, for the stone tool being the older one, was sacrosanct and alone possessed ceremonial purity, and hence stone stools occur along with iron ones in the graves of the early Iron Age.” 8. Antiquity of Tamil\n\nCertain literary traditions respecting the immemorial antiquity of Tamil and the Tamils Traditions relating to Tamil (1)\n\nKambar a great poet of the 12th century, describes Tamil as eternal.\n\n(2)\n\nAn old anonymous stray poem exalts Tamil as follows: ōṅga lidaivan duyarndōr tolaviḷaṅgi ēṅgolinīr ?ālat tiruḷakaṟṟum -> āṅgavaṟṟuḷ miṉṉ,,r taṉiyāli veṅgadirōṉ->rēṉaiyadu taṉṉē rilāda tamil.\n\nTranslation If the two things that hail from a mountain, shine so as to be adored by the great, and expel darkness from the earth surrounded by the roaring sea: one is the hot->rayed Sun riding on a single->wheeled chariot of lightning->like effulgence, and the other the incomparable Tamil. Traditions relating to the Tamils (1)\n\nThe idea expressed in the 34th stanza of Puṟapporuḷ Ve->bā Mālai, that the origin of the Maṟavā community was anterior to the evolution of earthy soil out of rocky ground, though inordinately exaggerative, serves to point out the high antiquity of the Tamil race.\n\n(2)\n\nAnother hyperbolical statement by Parimēlalagar, the popular commentator of Thirukkuṟaḷ, that the three royal lines, viz. Chera, Chola and Pandiya were countinuing prosperously from the time of Creation, serves the same purpose.\n\nCaldwell's observations on the High Antiquity of the Tamilican Form of Speech Passages from Caldwell's Dravidian Comparative Grammar affording glimpses of the primordeal nature of Tamil: “Does there not seem to be reason for regarding the Dravidian family of languages, not only as a link of connection between the Indo->European and Scythian groups but -> in some particulars, especially in relation to the pronouns -> as the best surviving representative of a period in the history of human speech older than the Indo->European stage, older than the Scythian, and older than the separation of the one from the other”1 “It is a different question whether some of the Dravidian forms and roots may not have formed a portion of the linguistic inheritance which appears to have descended to the earliest Dravidians from the fathers of the human race. I should be inclined, however to seek for traces of that inheritance only in the narrow area of the simplest and most necessary, and therefore probably the most primitive, elements of speech”2\n\nThe hypothesis of the existence of a remote original affinity between the Dravidian languages and Sanskrit, or rather between those languages and the Indo->European family of tongues, inclusive of Sanskrit, of such a nature as to allow us to give the Dravidian languages a place in the Indo->European group, is altogether different from the notion of the direct derivation of those languages from Sanskrit. The hypothesis of a remote original affinity is favoured by some interesting analogies both in the grammar and in the vocabulary, which will be noticed in their place. Some of those analogies are best accounted for by the supposition of the retention by the Dravidian family, as by Finnish and Turkish, of certain number of roots and forms belonging to the prae->Aryan period, the period which preceded the final separation of the Indo>European group of tongues from the Scythian.”3\n\n1.D.C.G.,p.x 2.Ibid,Preface,p.xi 3.D.C.G .Indroduction,p.42\n\n“Much light is thrown by the pronouns on the relationship of languages and families of languages; for the personal pronouns, and especially those of the first and second persons singular, evince more of the quality of permanence than any other parts of speech, and are generally found to change but little in the lapse of ages. They are more permanent even than the numerals, the signs of case, and the verbal inflexions; and though, like everything else, they are liable to change, yet their connections and ramifications may be traced amongst nearly all the languages of mankind, how widely so ever sundered by time or place. In some instances the personal pronouns constitute the only appreciable point of contact or feature of relationship between languages which appear to have belonged originally to one and the same family but which, in the lapse of time and through the progress of mutation, have become generically different. This remark especially applies to the pronouns of the first person, which of all parts of speech appears to be the most persistent.”1 ‘I need not call attention to the beautiful and philosophical regularity of this quadruple set of remote, proximate, and intermediate demonstratives and interrogatives. In no other language or family of languages in the world shall we find its equal, or even its second. In addition to which, the circumstance that the demonstrative vowels are not only used in these languages with an invariable and exact discrimination of meaning which is not found in the Indo->European tongues (with the solitary and partial exception of the New Persiaṅ, but are also associated with a corresponding interrogative vowel of which the Indo->European tongues are totally ignorant, tends to confirm the supposition which I have already expressed, that the Dravidian family has retained some prae->Sanskrit elements of immense antiquity; and in particular, that its demonstratives, instead of being borrowed from Sanskrit, represent those old Japhetic bases from which the domontratives of Sanskrit itself, as well as of various other members of the Indo>European family, were derived.”2\n\n1.D.C.G p.359 2.Ibid pp.421->2\n\nProximate Demonstrative Mas.

H.Schoff. “thousands of years before the emergence of the Greeks from savagery............ Egypt and the nations of Ancient India came into being, and a commercial system was developed for the interchange of products within those limits, having its centre of exchange near the head of the Persian gulf. The peoples of that region, the various Arab tribes and more especially those ancestors of the Phoenicians, the mysterious Red Men, were the active carriers or intermediaries. The growth of civilization in India created an active merchant marine, trading to the Euphrates and Africa, and eastwards we know not whither. The Arab merchants, apparently, tolerated the presence of Indian traders in Africa but reserved for themselves the commerce within the Red sea, that lucrative commerce which supplied precious stones and spices and incense to the ever increasing service of the gods of Egypt. This was their prerogative, jealously guarded and upon this they lived and prospered according to the prosperity of the Pharaohs. The muslins and spices of India they fetched themselves or received from the Indian traders in their ports on either side of the gulf of Aden; carrying them in turn over the highlands to the Upper Nile, or through the Red Sea and across the desert to the\n\nThebes or Memphis.” It may be added that the articles taken to Egypt by the Arab intermediaries were South Indian ones and that South Indian Paradavar took them in their boats to Aden and the East African coast. “In the inscriptions of Harkhuf, an Assuan noble under (the Egyptiaṅ king Mernere of the VI Dynasty (B.C. 2,600) occurs the following: ‘I descended (from country of Yan, Southern Nubia) with 300 asses laden with incense, ebony, grain, panthers, ivory, throw->sticks and every good product.” The ebony referred to may be African ebony; but it may also have been Indian ebony, which was superior to the African one and was in ancient times taken from India to the Persian gulf, whence the Arabians took it to the coast of Africa, and from there it was taken via the Upper Nile to Egypt, as it was in later times, i.e. 1,500 B.C. and after this date Indian ebony was so popular that Theophrastus (IV century B.C.) ascribes the wood to India only and Virgil (Georgics II, 116,7) speaks of it as peculiar to India. In a later chapter it will be shown that grain and panthers were exported to Africa in later times. These two articles here mentioned may also have gone from South India. “In the VI dynasty, under Pepi II (xxvi century B.C.) a royal officer, Sebni, sent to the Tigre highlands, records how he descended to Wawat and Uthek, and sent on the royal attendant Iri, with two others, bearing incense, clothing (probably cottoṅ, one tusk and one hide.” Now the Deccan was the only part of the world where cotton cloth was woven in those far off days.\n\n1.Ibid p.565 2.Ibid.p.606\n\n“The ivory mentioned above was African but may also have been Indian. From early times Indian ivory was in demand, partly because it was finer than any other. Moreover it was easier to kill elephants in Indian forests than in the wilder, thicker and more unhealthy African forests. The elephant->hunters of Abyssinia and Somaliland who supplied African ivory to the Egyptian kings used adzes, axes and swords; and Indian was the only country whence iron implements could have been imported in those times. In exchange for these, India imported from Africa incense and sweet smelling gums, largely used in this country in the Vedic Age. There is record of the export of iron from India in the next age and we may well believe that this commerce existed in the earlier age. “The Vedic mantras refer to men who went to far off lands for “interchange of merchandise.” Traders “desiring wealth sent ships to sea;” “parties of merchants went on the ocean in ships with a hundred oars” to distant lands for sale and barter. This of course does not refer to Tamil trade but if the Northern ārya people traded to distant countries, the South Indian sailors must have been their teachers of the art of sailing; for the latter had developed from early times extensive sea->trade and the former were not sailors in early days.”1 South's Link with Ancient Egypt New Light on History “Hyderabad, Sept. 14. Recent archaeological finds in Egypt had confirmed that there were close contacts between the Tamils in South India and pre->dynastic Egyptians, Mr.Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs, said yesterday.\n\n“Laying the foundation->stone for the State Archives building in Osmania University campus he said the Egyptian finds bore close resemblance to those unearthed in Tamilnadu. These discoveries had proved beyond doubt that the Tamils had contacts with Ancient Egypts pre>dynastic people. “Mr.Kabir said it was very difficult to say who were the indigenous people of India. Even the Adivasis might not be the indigenous people. It was, however, certain that the Indo->Gangetic people were comparatively new and for a time when the Deccan Plateau was populated the Gangetic Plain was unfit for human habitation” -> P.T.I -> The Mail, 1st Sep. 1962. 1.H.T.pp.39->42 9. Lemuria, the Original Home of the Tamilians (1) Internal Evidences Iḷaṅgōvadigaḷ the illustrious author of Silappadikāram, an epic of the 2nd century A.D., refers in unequivocal and unmistakable terms to the submerged continent as the old territory of the Pandiya dynasty, at the southern extremity of which a gigantic mountain chain called Kumari and a huge river called Pahṟuḷi were situated. 1.H.T.pp.39->42 Adiyārkkunallār, the celebrated commentator of Silappadikāram, explicitly mentions seven septenary groups of states which together with many others constituted the submerged continent, that lay north and south extending over a distance of about 2000 miles. The nature of the account is such that it ought to have been taken from a previous authentic record, and could not have been fabricated by the commentator. Tradition says that the Pandiya dynasty was the earliest, and that the other two, viz., Chola and Chera, were descended later from two brothers of a Pandiya king, who were appointed Vice->Roys of two Northern provinces, which became independent kingdoms in course of time. So, the submerged continent or a greater part of it was not only the ancient Pāṇdinādu but also the original Tamil country. The 9th poem of Puranāṉūṟu, an anthology of the 2nd century A.D., refers to one Nediyōṉ, a pre->historic Pandiyan king of Kumarinadu, a portion of whose territory was watered by the river Pahṟuḷi. The commentary on Iṟaiyaṉār Agapporul , whose original form is attributed to Nakkīrar of the 2nd century A.D. and present form assigned to the 7th century A.D., gives the traditional account of the three ancient Tamil Academies of literary fame. It is a promiscuous mass of hearsay information about events of remote and very remote periods separated by centuries and millenia, containing several legendary and prochronistic statements. All the same, it cannot be summarily dismissed as of no use or value, as is done by some South Indian historians. It is the duty of the historian to evolve order out of chaotic data. That there existed three Tamil Academies in ancient times, the first two in the submerged continent and the last one in modern Madurai, is admitted by all the greatest Tamil scholars of\n\nthis century including Dr.U.V. Swaminatha Ayyar and Prof.R. Raghava Iyengar. There is nothing to prove, that the number of kings who patronised them, are incredibly or improbably high. There is also no room for any doubt about the duration of the Academies, if the high antiquity of Tamil and its association with Lemuria are taken into consideration. The figures may not be precise; but the fundamental facts remain solid and sound. The history of the submerged continent is interspersed with accounts of several inroads of the sea; The first inroad devoured the southern part of the continent, and put an end to the First Academy, the seat of which was the original Madurai, the first Pandiyan capital on the banks of the river Pahṟuḷi. The second, submerged the middle part of the continent along with Alaivāy(?), the second Pandiyan capital and the seat of the Second Academy, situated at the mouth of the river Kumari and called Kapādapura in Sanskrit. The third, sank a vast area of land to the east of the Indian Peninsula and created the Bay of Bengal. The fourth engulfed Kāvirippūmpaṭṭinam and the river Kumari and a strip of land lying between them. After the disappearance of the river Kumari, the cape near its site is bearing that name. After the second capital of the Pandiyas went under the sea, the surviving Pandiyan king or a member of the royal line, led a bold expedition against the Chera and Chola kings, and seized the southernmost districts from their territories. This is stated explicitly in the commentary of Adiyārkkunallār, and somewhat vaguely in the opening lines of the 104th stanza of Kalittokai, an anthology of the 2nd century A.D. The story of the Aryan Sage Agastya's coming down to the South to equalise the southern hemisphere with the northern, in the tilted scale of the heavenly balance, caused by the overweight of the eighteen classes of celestial hosts assembled on Mount Kailash, on the occasion of Siva's marriage with Malaimagaḷ (Pārvati), and his suppresion of Vindhya mountains on his way, are nothing but mythological representation of the facts, that the level of Gondwana land was high at the southern end because of the existence of the Kumari Mountain Range, and low at the northern end because of the Himalayas lying then under the Sea, and that the situation was reversed after the emergence of the Himalayas and the submergence of the Kumari Mountains, and that the Vindhyan Range became consequently comparatively small. Significance of the name Thenmoli and Thenpulattar The word Theṉmoli, the alternate name of Tamil, is a relative term indirectly suggestive of the indigenous nature of the Tamil language. Tamil was called Thenmoli in relation to Sanskrit, which was called Vadamoli, the northern language. The term Thenmoli, was originally used in a wider sense as an equivalent of the newly>coined ‘Tamilican’, when the Dravidian languages had not branched off from Tamil and remained only as dialects. Deified souls of departed ancestors are called in Tamil Thenpular or Thenpulattār or Thenpula Vālnar, ‘the manes, as living in the south.’ The daily offering of libations to the manes is called Thenpulattār Vēḷvi. These expressions are enough to show that Lemuria was the original home of the Tamilicans. The proverbial custom of a Kuṟava husband having a dose of puerperal medicine on behalf of his wife, is a relic of the primitive custom of couvade, practised in Lemuria and South Africa.\n\n(2) External Evidences “The Indo->African->Austral origin of the Dravidians has its supporters in Messrs. Keane and Morris. Tamilian traditions say that a large continent once existed in the Indian Ocean, which was connected with South India, and which was overwhelmed and submerged by a huge deluge. The Hebrew scriptures have preserved a distinct account of an appalling deluge occasioned by continuous showers of rain for forty days and nights, coupled with the overflow of the waters of the ocean. Geological research has shown that the Indian Ocean was once a continent, and that this submerged continent, sometimes called Lemuria, originally extended from Madagascar to Malay Archipelago, connecting South India with Africa and Australia. According to Sclater, the Dravidians entered India from the South long before the submergence of this continent. There are unmistakable indications in the Tamil traditions that the land affected by the deluge was contiguous with Tamillagam, and that after the subsidence, the Tamils naturally betook themselves to their Northern provinces. The assertion of the geologists that Lemuria touched China, Africa, Australia and Comorin will only show the vast extent of the Tamil country, and can never help to dogmatise that the Tamils came from any of these now far->off regions; and settled in South India. On the evidence of the very close affinities between the plants and animals in Africa and India at a very remote period, Mr.Oldham concludes that there was once a continuous stretch of dry land connecting South Africa and India. The aborigines of Australia have been associated by many distinguished ethnologists with the Dravidians of India. The affinities between the Dravidians and Australians have been based upon the employment of certain words, and upon the use of the boomerang by the two peoples, and upon certain correspondences in their physical types.”1 1.D.I.pp,25->27 “We shall now discuss what might be called the indigenous theory. According to this theory the Dravidians should have lived in South India from the earliest times. This is almost a faith with the Tamils, a typical Dravidian people. We shall strike the mine of ancient Tamil literature to see if its contents shed any light on this indigenous theory. We shall later on demonstrate beyond the possibility of a doubt the high antiquity of Tamil literature. We shall here simply note that the Tolkappiyam and some poems of the Puranāṉuṟu are all very ancient and anterior to the Christian era. “In the oldest extant Tamil classics there are no traditions, pointing to a home outside the Tamilagam. The oldest Tamil works are full of word->pictures of the blazing sun that burns the stalwart trees that shade, the ferocious beasts that roams the bright plumed birds that fill, in the torrid South Indian Peninsula. When there are words for dews and mist, there are none for snow or ice.”1 1.Ibid,pp.55&56. “An important ethnographic fact and one which is significant, is that the description of tree>climbing by the Dyaks of Borneo, as given by Wallace, might have been written on the ānaimalai hills of Southern India, and would apply equally well in every detail to the Kādirs who inhabit those hills. An interesting custom, which prevails among the Kādirs and the Mala Vēdans of Travancore, and among them alone, so far as I know, in the Indian Peninsula, is that of chipping all or some of the incisor teeth into the form of a sharp pointed, but not serrated cone. The operation is said to be performed, among the Kādirs, with a chisel or bill->hook and file, on boys at the age of eighteen, and girls at the age of ten or thereabouts. It is noted by Skeat and Blagden that the Jakuns of the Malay Peninsula are accustomed to file their teeth to a point.\n\nMr.Crawford tells us further that, in the Malay Archipelago, the practice of filing and blackening the teeth is a necessary prelude to marriage, the common way of expressing the fact that a girl has arrived at puberty being that she had her teeth filed. In an article entitled “Die Zauber>bilderschriften der Negrito in Malaka,” Dr.K.T.Preuss describes in detail the designs on the bamboo combs, etc., of the Negritos of Malacca, and compares them with the strikingly similar designs on the bamboo combs worn by the Kādirs of Southern India. He works out in detail the theory that the design is not, as I called it an ornamental geometric pattern, but consists of hieroglyphics. It is noted by Skeat and Blagden that “the Semong women wore in their hair a remarkable kind of comb, which appears to be worn entirely as a charm against diseases. These combs were almost invariably made of bamboo, and were decorated with an infinity of designs, no two of which ever entirely agreed. It was said that each disease had its appropriate pattern. Similar combs are worn by the Pangan, the Semang and Sakai of Perak, and most of the mixed (Semang->Sakai) tribes.” I am informed by Mr.Vincent that, as he knows, the Kādir combs are not looked on as charms, and the markings thereon have no mystic significance. A Kādir man should always make a comb, and present it to his wife just before marriage or at the conclusion of the marriage ceremony, and the young men vie with each other as to who can make the nicest comb. Some times they represent strange articles on the combs. Mr.Vincent has, for example, seen a comb with a very good imitation of the face of a clock scratched on it.”1 1.C.T.S.I.Introduction,pp.XXi&xxii. “In an article devoted to the Australians, Professor R.Semon, writes as follows”: We must, without hesitation, presume that the ancestors of the Australians stood, at the time of their immigration to the continent on a lower rung of culture than their living representatives of today. Whence, and in what manner, the immigration took place, it is difficult to determine. In the neighbouring quarter of the globe there lives no race, which is closely related to the Australians. Their nearest neighbours, the Papuans of New Guinea, the Malays of the Sunda Islands, and the Macris of New Zealand, stand in no close relationship to them. On the other hand, we find further away, among the Dravidians of India, types which remind us forcibly of the Australians in their anthropological characters. In drawing attention to the resemblance of the hill->tribes of the Deccan to the Australians, Huxley says: ‘An ordinary->cooly such as one can see among the sailors of any newly->arrived East India vessel, would if stripped, pass very well for an Australian, although the skull and lower jaw are generally less coarse.’ Huxley here goes a little too far in his accentuation of similarity of type. We are, however, undoubtedly confronted with a number of characters -> skull formation, features, wavy curled hair -> in common between the Australians and Dravidians, which gain in importance from the fact that, by the researches of Norris, Bleek and Caldwell, a number of points of resemblance between the Australian and Dravidian languages have been discovered, and this, despite the fact that the homes of the two races are so far apart, and that a number of races are wedged in between them, whose languages have no relationship whatever in between them, whose languages have no relationship whatever to either the Dravidian or Australian. There is much that speaks in favour of the view that the Australians and Dravidians sprang from a common main branch of the human race. According to the laborious researches of Paul and Fritz Sarasin, the Veddas of Ceylon, whom one might call pre->Dravidians, would represent an off->shoot from this main stem. When they branched off, they stood on a very low rung of development, and seem to have made hardly any progress worth mentioning.”1 1.C.T.S.I.,Introduction,pp.XXX & XXXi “The importance, which has been attached by many authorities to the theory of the connection between the Dravidians and Australians, is made very clear from the passages in their writings, which I have quoted. Before leaving this subject, I may appropriately cite as an important witness Sir William Turner, who has studied the Dravidians and Australians from the standpoint of craniology. “Many ethnologists of great eminence”, he writes, “have regarded the\n\naborigines of Australia as closely associated with Dravidians of India. Some also consider the Dravidians to be a branch of the great Caucasian stock, and affiliated therefore to Europeans. If these two hypotheses are to be regarded as sound, a relationship between the aboriginal Australians and the European would be established through the Dravidian people of India. The affinities between the Dravidians and Australians have been based upon the employment of certain words by both people, apparently derived from common roots; by the use of the boomerang, similar to the well->known Australian weapon, by some Dravidian tribes; by the Indian peninsula having possibly had in a pervious geologic epoch a land connection with the Austro->Malayan Archipelago, and by certain correspondences in the physical type of two people. Both Dravidians and Australians have dark skins approximating to black; dark eyes; black hair, either straight, wavy or curly, but not woolly or frizzly; thick lips; low nose with wide nostrils; usually short stature, though the Australians are somewhat taller than the Dravidians. When the skulls are compared with each other whilst they correspond in some particulars, they differ in others. In both races, the general form and proportions are dolichocephalic, but in the Australians the crania are absolutely longer than in the Dravidians, owing in part to the prominence of the glabella. The Australian skull is heavier, and the outer table is coarser and rougher than in the Dravidian; the forehead also is much more receding; the sagittal region is frequently ridged, and the slope outwards to the parietal eminence is steeper. The Australians in the norma facialis have the glabella and supra->orbital ridges much more projecting; the nasion more depressed; the jaws heavier; the upper jaw usually prognathous, sometimes remarkably so.” Of twelve Dravidian skulls measured by Mr.William Turner, in seven the jaw was orthognathous, in four, in the lower term of the mesognathous series; one specimen only was prognathic. The customary type of jaw, therefore, was orthognathic. The conclusion at which Sir William Turner arrives is that by a careful comparison of Australian and Dravidian crania, there ought not to be much difficulty in distinguishing one from the other. The comparative study of the characters of the two series of crania has not led me to the conclusion that they can be adduced in support of the theory of the unity of the two people.”1 3) Dravidian languages confined to the area of pre->partition India All the Dravidian languages, now reckoned 19, are confined to India and Pakistan which together constituted the former British India, and no language of any form bearing close relationship to the Dravidian family is found to exist anywhere else, except isolated Dravidian roots and words that form part of the basic vocabulary of the West Aryan languages, both classical and modern.\n\n1.C.T.S.I.Introduction,pp.XXXV & XXXVi\n\n(4) The course of corruption of the Dravidian Form of Speech lying South to North Within the area of the Dravidian languages, all the cultivated and rich members of the family are not only confined to the South, but also close to one another, so close as not to allow any alien to intrude into their midst. Tamil “the earliest cultivated and most highly developed of the Dravidian languages, in many respects the representative language of the family” -> is spoken farthest South. Those of the Dravidian languages spoken in North and Central India, are not only crude and devoid of literature, but scattered here and there amongst members of other families of languages. Even within Tamil Nadu, the language becomes purer and purer as we go farther South, and the dialects of Thirunelveli and Jaffna are by far the best in many respects. Thus it will be seen, that the Dravidian Form of Speech becomes more and more enriched as we go farther and farther South, and more and more impoverished as we go farther and farther North, showing that its course of corruption lies South to North. If the Dravidians were not autochthons but immigrants from the Meditterranean region, as some scholars think, the situation would have been just the reverse.\n\n(5)The Dravidian languages of North India most corrupted and isolated\n\n(1) Brahui Dr.Grierson writes regarding Brahui as follows: “The home of the Brahuis is the mountainous regions in Eastern Baluchistan and the neighbouring districts of Sind. They are much split up into small tribes, on account of the difficulty of access to their homes in the mountains. It is only in the Provinces of Sarawan and Jhalavan and in the Southeast, so far as Kuch in Makran, that we find them together in greater Tūmāns, i.e., tent->villages. They also apparently avoid the plains where the Balochi reside.” According to the census of 1911, the number of speakers of Brahui is 170, 998. “Brahui has no written literature..........Alla Bux and Captain Nicolson made use of the Persian alphabet for Brahui. The system of noting the various sounds of the language introduced by them was afterwards slightly modified by Dr. Trumpp.” “The various letters are, in most cases, pronounced as in Hindostani.”\n\n“Nouns do not differ for gender. Brahui has accordingly given up the common Dravidian distinction between rational and irrational nouns. This state of affairs is certainly due to Eranian influence. There are, however perhaps some traces of the neuter, i.e., the irrational, gender in the conjugation of verbs. When it is necessary to distinguish the natural gender the Persian words nar, man, and mādah mother, are prefixed.” “There is no separate oblique base in the singular. Brahui in this respect agrees with Kurukh and Malto. A similar state of affairs is also met with in some Tamil dialects such as Kaikadi and Burgandi. “The dative and the accusative have the same form, as is also the case in some dialects of Tamil such as Kaikadi and Burgandi, and in Gondi, Naiki, and Kolami.” The first three numerals are distinctly Dravidian, and the higher ones are Aryan loan->words. Musi->, three, can be compared with Tulu mūji, (three) etc. “The ordinals are formed by adding mikō or vikō; Thus, Iraṭ->mikō, second; musiṭ->mikō, mus->vikō, third; chār->vikō, fourth; etc. ‘First’ is muhiko. munhā, or avvalkō.” Dr.Caldwell says: “The number of nouns and verbs in Brahui which can with certainty be identified with Dravidian roots is not considerable, but it is equal to the number found in the Orāon vocabulary.” The degree of corruption Brahui words have undergone is discernible from the following list:\n\nTamil\n\nBrahui\n\nMeaning\n\nvāy tēḷ sevi sey mun var, vā mūḷai iru magār oru\n\nbā telt khaf ke mon\n\nmouth scorpion ear to do before\n\nbar mili ar mār(soṅ) as->it\n\nto come brain to be sons one\n\nnir iraṇḍu pāl kaḷ\n\ndir irat pāhlt k\n\nwater two milk (pl. sfx.)\n\nDeclension of a noun -> khal, stone\n\nNom.

It has no literature of its own, and has been strongly influenced by Aryan tongues, especially in vocabulary. It has borrowed Aryan forms for the numerals ‘three’ and above. Aryan forms are also used commonly for the first two numerals. The following list of Malto words is for comparison with the Tamil originals.\n\nTamil\n\nMalto\n\nMeaning\n\nadu (it) avar oru kaṇ mūkku pal kādu kai maran tēḷ magaḷ āḷ al, var,\n\nāth owar ort, kānē muna pāla kēdu kēkha man, tilah moki alla vā bar->en\n\nhe, she, it they art one eye nose tooth ear hand manu tree scorpion daughter man come\n\nDeclension of a noun->manu, tree Nom.\n\nman->h\n\nAcc.\n\nmane\n\nInst.\n\nmanet\n\nDat.\n\nmanik\n\nAbl.\n\nmannte\n\nGen.\n\nmanki\n\nLoc.\n\nmanno\n\nVoc.\n\no manu\n\nBrahui and Malto are the North->westernmost and North-> easternmost members of the Dravidian family of languages, respectively. They are far apart without any other member of the family intervening, and farthest removed from Tamil. This accounts for their high degree of corruption and their consequent unintelligibility to the Tamilians, which characteristic is posessed in common by all the Dravidian languages spoken to the north of the Telugu country, whose northern boundary can be taken as the point, at which the course of intelligible linguistic corruption, from the Tamilian point of view, reaches the highest degree. The rendering of the English sentence ‘My father lives in that small house’ is ‘kanābāvah hamē chuna urā->ṭi tūlik.’ in Brahui, and ‘eṅg abbath ājoka adano dōkih’ in Malto, and indicates the highest degree of unintelligibility the two languages have attained.\n\n(6) The Dravidian language spoken by hill->tribes not primitive in character\n\nSome linguists, especially foreigners, labour under the illusion that all minor languages and dialects of the Dravidian family spoken by hill->tribes are primitive in character. The absurdity of this maxim becomes clear, when we subject those linguistic forms to etymological investigation. Almost all the words contained in them are corruptions and not primitive forms. For instance the Brahui word ‘bāk’ (mouths) and the Toda word ‘nint’ (thine) are true corruptions of the Tamil words ‘vāykaḷ’ and ‘ninadu’ respectively. The age, when the language of the mountaineers was in the primitive condition of the Tamilican Speech was over long long ago, long before the establishment of the first Academy. The present hill tribes, all over India, are the descendants of those who took to mountain life in the distant past, in order to escape the oft->recurring tribal and political wars, authorized and unauthorized cattle->raids and periodical plunder by predatory chiefs, which were the order of the day. Tolkāppiyam clearly describes the conventional commencement or declaration of ancient wars by capture of cows belonging to the enemy country. Unprimitiveness of the Tamilican Hill->tribes Western philologists, in general, having no idea of the Lemurian origin of the Tamilican race, its racial unity throughout the several stages of cultural evolution and linguistic development, and its subsequent breaking->up into several nations, erroneously regard all the Tamilican hill->tribes as primitive peoples living in isolation from primeval times, and still preserving their languages in their primitive condition. Historical and philological investigations clearly show that their ancestors were once inhabitants of the plains, and took up their permanent abodes on the hills in order to escape the ravages of frequent wars and plunders or religious persecution by ambitious or fanatic rulers.\n\nDr.A. Ayappan, Secretary, Aboriginal Tribes Welfare Enquiry Committee. 1946, writes on the subject as follows: -> Flesh of our own Flesh “The so->called aboriginal tribes are wrongly believed to be different from the plains populations in ethnical and racial origins; while a very small percentage of some insignificant tribes such as the Kadars of the Anamalais show the fizzly hair -> the individuals with this characteristic can be counted on one's fingers -> the majority of the tribes are for racial purposes indistinguishable from the plainsmen in the adjoining regions. A Chenchu or Konda Reddi or Koya cannot be distinguished by any bodily peculiarities from the plains Andhra, if he were dressed in the plains fashion and spoke without his dialectical peculiarities. The popular idea still propagated in our school books that the hill"
