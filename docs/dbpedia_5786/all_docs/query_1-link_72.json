        "text": "This paper argues for a critical approach towards the glorification of 'mothertongue' evident in matrubhasha sentiments in India. Not all mothertongues come with sentimentalism associated with them, especially by those who belong to upper-castes. Languages come with memories of caste. To that extent, Dalits (not all) may see English as a more liberal and liberating language than their own mothertongues. Language in this paper is not merely linguistic, but a refashioning of self -- translation is one of the text, and the world.\n\nAn evolutionary and historical method has not helped us to understand the Caste System and its exploitative nature in Indian Society. Therefore, we need to analyse it from a new perspective , that is, from a contemporary perspective which on the one hand highlights the domination and monopolization of secular institutions of governance, production, education etc. by so-called upper castes. And exclusion and simultaneous assertion of the so-called lower- castes Dalits. The paper has deliberately avoided the status and assertion of the intermediary and Other Backward (Shudra) Castes because paucity of space.\n\nIn traditional Indian societies, the Caste system is seen as an agency of social stratification. On the basis of the Caste system, the people in Indian societies are categorised as- Brahmin, Kshatrya, Vaishya and Sudra. Thus, the Caste is considered as a dominating system in Indian societies, especially among the Hindus. In understanding caste, an ambiguity is seen that people usually use the two termsVarna and Jati interchangeably to refer the caste system. But these two terms has their specific meaning. Therefore we can’t interchangeably use these two terms. Hence, this article is an attempt to break the ambiguity between the, varna and jati. Moreover, we can’t properly understand the Caste, alienating it from its relatives with whom the caste keeps intimate relation. Further, the relatives with whom it interacts, made the caste a perpetuate one in Indian societies by reproducing the same. Hence, this article is an attempt to understand the caste with its relatives such as- Endogamy, Division of work, Punishments, the ideology of purity and pollution and Gender.\n\nExploring the contingencies and paradoxes shaping the idealism/materialism separation in absolutist terms, the paper attempts to analyze the problems of such separatist tendencies in terms of dealing the question of caste. Engaging with the problems of separating ‘idea’ and ‘matter’ in relation to three dominant aspects that shape the conceptualization of caste— origin(s), body, and society— the paper presents caste as an enmeshed idea-matter embrace that gains its circulation in practice through embodiment. Aiming to counter caste with its own logic and internal contradictions, the paper further proceeds to show that these three aspects, that had otherwise been seen for a long time as shaping caste, also contradicts their own efficacy and logic. With such an approach the paper presents caste as a ghost that feed on our embodied ideas and thus, bringing in the trope of (mis)reading, the paper tries to examine the intricacies haunting any attempt to deal with the ghost. The paper the...\n\nThe purpose of this article, as the title indicates, is to consider together two of the most important processes that, have been identified as operating for a long time in Hindu society-. I have concentrated on Nirmal Kumar Bose for his formulations on tribal absorption and on M.N. Srinivas for his elaboration of the process of Sanskritization in Hindu society. The emphasis is on a systematic treatment of such contributions made by Bose and Srinivas as are relevant to the theme of this article. First of all, an effort is made to reconstruct the expositions of their formulations, as far as possible in the language of the authors themselves. Next, Bose and Srinivas are subjected to a critical theoretical examination. Finally, draw¬ing from the analysis, certain related substantive issues are raised. The critique that emerges through this effort, thus, does not aspire to be exhaustive. I have tried to formulate an argument that has received rela¬tively little attention in Indian sociology. It is hoped that this article will bring out the relevance of such an analysis, particularly of treating Bose and Srinivas together.\n\nAbstract This paper attempts to study variation, structural commonalities and innovations made in the formation of full-fledged (the wh-type of English) and participial relative clauses in Tibeto-Burman languages, Dakkhini Hindi-Urdu (Indo-Aryan), Bhālāvali Bhasha, Karnataka Saraswat Konkani (Mangalore Konkani; Indo-Aryan) and Saurashtra (an Indo-Aryan language spoken in Tamilnadu). We show that in contact situations, specific functional categories are reanalyzed to accommodate newly-acquired syntactic phenomena. We attempt to demonstrate that a creole may prove to be the catalyst in the innovation of a construction type that is novel to the recipient language. We provide data that show that in contact situations, a language may use the Juxtaposition strategy as a means to express noun modification, as is the case in Nagamese, an Assamese based creole, and the Konkani spoken by the Indian diaspora in South Africa. We demonstrate that the full-fledged relative clause found in some Naga languages is due to the influence of Nagamese. Syntax,"
