THE KAVAL SYSTEM IN COLONIAL TAMIL NADU \nby S.Ravichandran \nDepartment of History, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli \n \nKaval system was an ancient and indigenous system of policing in Tamilnadu. The functionaries of this system were known as Kavalkarars. Protecting the people and their properties was the primary duty of the Kavalkarars. Apart from this duty watching the movements of strangers, particularly during festivals, and protecting the travellers were the other responsibilities of the Kavalkarars. In return for their services they were paid by the inhabitants either in cash or in kind, mostly the latter. As the traditional custodians of the village they were bestowed with well defined rights and duties. The Kavalship was hereditary. Most of the Kavalkarars were from the martial communities of Tamilnadu with a long history of recruitment in the army, such as the Maravars, Kallars, Agamudaiyars, Naickers, Padayachis and Udayars though the participation of other communities like the Kuravars, Valayars and Parayars cannot be discounted. As protectors of people and their belongings these Kavalkarars tended to enjoy special privileges and considerable power.",
