        "meta_description": "The literature on transnationalism has largely tended to focus on first or second-generation migrants. Unlike the literature on plantation studies, this has resulted in a relative blindness to historical inequalities, particularly how these past inequalities going back more than 60 or 70 years or multiple generations, may affect the present in a transnational context. This article examines the growing phenomenon of interest in the transnational and local worship of ancestral tutelary deities (kula devam) among Malaysian Hindus. In doing so, it will specifically look at the role of caste identity in the emergence of transnational ritual and kinship networks. The paper argues that the performance of ritual worship of ancestral deities among Malaysian Hindus – part of a religious response to specific socio-economic changes that have occurred within the pressures of a capitalist, Islamised modernity – has been shaped by entrenched caste and class divisions in contrasting ways. The inequalities at the time of colonial labour migration and the differences between the landed mid-level (non-Brahmin) castes and the landless Adi Dravida \"untouchables\" or Dalits, seep into the present in the form of revitalisation of ritual-kinship links to Tamil Nadu among the former – a contemporary social sign of their \"privileged lineage\". At the same time, the lack of economic progress and social ills suffered by the dispossessed in Malaysia, are seen by many Dalit interlocutors as a consequence of ignoring the requisite ritual worship of their kula devam in now often forgotten villages of ancestral origin.",

        "text": "2By noon, the gathering at the little temple near Dengkil, a small town on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, had swelled to about 150 people. The temple itself, the Sri Jada Veera Kali Sanngli Muneeswaran Alayam, was originally just an uncovered shrine created by Indians who worked on the nearby plantations around Dengkil. A large, physically imposing man with a shaved head and several thick gold chains around his neck saw me standing nearby with a camera dangling from my shoulder and called out to me \"Eh Mottai! [Hey, Baldy!],” and gestured me to come and sit down. Having run out of disposable plates, he ordered two of his \"boys” to get banana leaves as replacements. I watched them jump over a wall to help themselves to a banana tree in a neighbour’s backyard.\n\n5 \"Lah” or \"La” is a very common Malaysian and Singaporean English slang expression, often added at (...)\n\n6 Madhurai Veeran, like Muniandy, is a Tamil folk deity, who is worshipped as a protector God. The m (...)\n\nThese people don’t know what is their kula devam. So they put whatever they want and call it their kula devam. You see a lot of people have Muniandy lah , Madhurai Veeran lah, all in front of their homes. You ask them, they say it is their kula devam. You ask them where their thatha (grandfather) is from, they don’t know. Where got like that?\n\n5Although retired from his job as a teacher, Prakash was very active in the local chapter of the Namakkal Sangam, a social and welfare organization which was supposedly for those from the Namakkal region in India, but was essentially a caste-based organization for Gounders in Malaysia, many of whom originate from the region around Namakkal or the \"Kongu belt” of Tamil Nadu. Gounders are also known as Kongu Velallars, the name originating from their traditional profession as land-owning peasant farmers. Prakash was of the opinion that worship of one’s kula devam has to be done at the actual ancestral temple in India: \"The temple your grandfather’s father and their father all worshipped is there. The kula devam is there. How can you put something here and call it your kula devam?”\n\n6Kula devam, in Tamil, refers to the tutelary deity propitiated by one’s patrilineal ancestors. Among Tamils, the kula devams are usually distinct from the popular agamic pan-Hindu deities such as Vishnu or Shiva and often take the form of local guardian deities that are mostly associated with vernacular forms of worship in villages. The phrase kula devam stems from the word \"kulam,” which can be loosely understood as one’s \"clan.” Thus, kula devam is literally the god of one’s clan.\n\n9Chinese immigrants in Malaysia, and more broadly in Southeast Asia, have also been involved in significant transnational outreach that has heightened in the past few decades. Kuah-Pearce (2011) has argued that \"collective memory” (Halbwachs, 1992) plays a significant role in Singaporean-Chinese reconstructing links to ancestral villages in China, in the establishment of a transnational moral economy, and in the carrying out of socio-religious activities. Recent extensive work by Kenneth Dean (2010, 2012) on the ritual links between the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia and the Putian plains in China has further shown that transnational and translocal religious practices and networks, even within long-established diasporas, can experience renewal and rejuvenation under certain social conditions. The study of Indians in Southeast Asia and their links to their ancestral villages offer an interesting point of comparison to this burgeoning literature on transnational religion among Chinese immigrants in the region within what has been described as \"an alternative Asian modernity” (Ong, 1999).\n\nA Brief History of Indians in Malaysia\n\n10Although India and Southeast Asia have had a long history of exchange in the form of trade, language, culture and religion, modern immigration from India to Malaysia began during British colonial times. Even though some Indian labour was used for work on coffee and tea plantations as early as the 1830s, it was from 1890s on that immigration occurred in substantial numbers, mostly to work in rubber estates (Mahajani, 1960: 53). The system of indentured labour used on colonial plantations, although seen as more humane than slavery, was still an immensely exploitative, as it forced workers to work in abhorrent conditions with a pay as low as 20 to 30 cents a day (Mahajani, 1960: 97). Indentured labour eventually gave way to what has been called the kangany system of recruitment. The kangany was a Tamil foreman whose job was to not only oversee labour on the estates, but also to recruit Indian \"coolie\" labour, usually from his own village or surrounding villages. Thus labour was recruited from particular geographical areas or a collection of villages and often included labourers relatives by blood or marriage.\n\n11The labourers who arrived on the plantations in Malaya were primarily from South India, and in particular Tamil Nadu. Among the Tamils, a substantial number – more than one-third – was from the so-called untouchables or Dalits, often from Paraiyar, Chakkliyan and a conglomerate of repressed castes collectively termed the \"Adi Dravidar” or the First Dravidians, a term popularised by the Indian caste reformer Periyar Ramasamy from the 1920s (Arasaratnam, 1979: 26). According to British conceptualisations about caste, those from South Indian untouchable castes were perceived as more docile and easier to manage, compared to other groups. Brahmins were almost entirely absent in the labour migration to Malaya. Apart from the Adi Dravidars, the groups that arrived included a substantial assortment of so-called \"clean” castes or Sat-Shudras, who were non-Brahmins such as the Kongu Vellalar (Gounder), Mukkulathor (comprising Kallars, Agamudayars and Maravars), Nadar, Pillai (Vellalar), the slightly lower Padayatchi (Vanniyar), and the trading and finance-oriented Chettiar group called Nagarathars, among others. In the Malaysian estates, caste played a role significant enough to result in separate labour lines for the clean castes and those belonging to Adi Dravidar groups (Jain, 1970). As confirmed by many of my older interlocutors, those from \"clean castes” would not eat at a Paraiyar home nor in some cases, even visit Paraiyar homes in the estates.\n\n13In the following two sections, I present ethnographic evidence for the growing phenomenon of transnational engagement with ancestral temples, villages of origin, and kinship network, among non-Brahmin \"caste Hindus,\" with particular focus on the Gounder community.\n\nThe Performance of Transnational Ancestral Rituals: Reaching the Ancestral Temple\n\n14I gripped the metal bar on the scooter tightly as we rumbled along on a stretch of particularly unreliable Indian road, on the outskirts of Salem in Tamil Nadu. We were on our way to the Athayi Amman kovil, a temple dedicated to a form of Amman, the Dravidian goddess venerated in numerous forms throughout Tamil Nadu and the south Indian diaspora. The temple was located near a village called Ilupili, about an hour and a half from Salem. My interlocutor, whom I will call Ravi, was driving the scooter helmetless, while informing me about the illustrious history of the Kongu Vellala Gounders. Ravi was related by blood (a distant consanguine relative) and marriage to Prakash, the 69-year-old Malaysian Gounder referred to at the beginning of this article. Ravi had married the daughter of Prakash’s aunt, who had lived in India all her life. On the way, he called attention to a large college campus run by a Gounder, and numerous successful local factories and businesses as evidence of the \"hard work\" and success of the Gounders. The topic of Grounder pride took a more sinister turn when Ravi began narrating the story of a Gounder girl in the area who had married an \"untouchable\" lower-caste Dalit boy. \"The Gounders value their honour,\" Ravi continued. \"The couple ran away and got married. Some weeks afterwards they came to a market and both were hacked to death (vetti pottanga),\" Ravi said matter-of-factly, glancing at me sideways on the bike. I mumbled something about that \"not being good.\" I was floundering trying to reconcile his evident moral justification for this hideous act and the kindly, hospitable person that I had come to know over the past few days, while staying at his home. As we drove closer to the temple, Ravi complained about the Nadars in the area who had apparently embraced Christianity before pointing to a cluster of humble homes away from the main road. \"That is the ceri [hamlet where ‘untouchables’ live]. That is where the Paraiyar fellows live,” he said. I mentally noted how easy it was to speak about caste in India, whereas in Malaysia, caste discussions tended to be had with a lot more hesitance and hushed voices.\n\n15I had travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Tamil Nadu with Prakash, his 36-year-old son Selva, and his 5-year-old granddaughter Naveena to visit their ancestral temple, one of the family’s regular \"return trips\" to perform rites to their kula devam. Naveena was a fourth-generation Indian in Malaysia. Her great-grandfather (Prakash’s father) travelled to Malaya in 1933 at the age of 16 or 17, approximately 83 years before I accompanied them on their trip back to India to their ancestral temple. Last renovated in 1936, the Athayi Amman temple is one of seven kula devam temples belonging to the Sellan kootam (clan) within the Kongu Vellala Gounder caste. The endogamous Gounder caste group is divided into numerous exogamous clan groups called kootams or kulams; some estimate the total number of Gounder kootams to be as high as 140 (Manickam, 1974: 36), although in Malaysia the number is estimated to be around 116 by some of my key Gounder informants. According to Prakash, there are approximately 200 families in Malaysia and Singapore who fall within the Sellan kootam, as well as some secondary migrants to Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\n16The trip from Malaysia to their kula devam temple started in Kuala Lumpur, where Prakash and his family boarded an AirAsia flight to Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) in Tamil Nadu. The low-cost Malaysian carrier has turned Kuala Lumpur into a regional transport hub, drastically reducing the cost of international travel in the region since its dramatic expansion in the early 2000s, eventually connecting 25 countries, including 11 destinations in India alone. Ravi awaited us at the Trichy airport, bundled us into a multi-purpose-vehicle, and drove us to his home near Salem, about a three-hour ride through small towns and villages, surrounded by green fields and dry, rocky hills. The following day the family arose by 5 am and, having bathed and dressed in their traditional finery, prepared for their trip to the Athayi Amman temple. The van loaded with several Indian relatives of Prakash, as well as food items including rice and vegetables, left for the temple early in the morning. A few photos were taken to mark the commencement of the auspicious visit.\n\n17The Athayi Amman kula devam temple complex featured a large gopuram (tower), courtyard, a recently constructed dining hall and even sleeping quarters for the temple administrator and his family. During our visit, the temple was in the midst of major reconstruction, including the addition of the impressive gopuram with sculptures of the Goddess and other protector deities. The core structure still betrayed its age, evident from the solid, ancient-looking grey pillars and walls around the inner sanctum (garba griha). This was the first time that the temple was being rebuilt after 80 long years. Fund-raising, however, had not been an issue. Not only did money pour in from the numerous families in Tamil Nadu, but also Sellan kootam members overseas. Tens of thousands of ringgit were sent by families from Malaysia, either directly or through those who had visited the temple in recent months. Ravi belonged to a different patrilineal clan – Thooran kootam. His kula devam temple near Salem raised 150 million rupees (2.2 million USD) for its recent reconstruction, which included substantial contributions from Gounder kootam members in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n19When Prakash and his group in the van arrived at the temple, followed by Ravi and me on the scooter, around twenty of his pangalis (extended kin related by patrilineal descent) were there waiting for him. The group gathered outside the temple and started a fire with wood and coconut husk. A couple of pots of water were brought to a boil and the visitors, including five-year-old Naveena, took turns pouring in grains of uncooked rice. The cooked rice would eventually be made into a pongal sweetened rice dish as an offering to the Goddess. The family’s sense of ownership of the temple was quite clear. Having presented the food, flowers and other items of worship to the priest, the entire family then entered the garba griha, the inner sanctum, for the pooja or worship. The garba griha is considered the holiest of holies, generally accessed only by the priest. In most temples in Malaysia, the family would have been relegated outside this sacred area; however Athayi Amman accepts this Malaysian family as one of her own and dispenses with all such formalities. On the other hand, the Dalits do not worship at this temple at all. \"They have their temple in the ceri. We don’t go there, they don’t come here,\" one of Prakash’s pangalis said. Here, we can see how Malaysian returnees often encounter and sometimes adopt much more strict ideas of caste, whether it is ideas about inter-caste violence or residential and devotional segregation, or even the everyday, unequal interpersonal interactions between caste Hindus and Dalits. One Malaysian Gounder interviewee confessed that he was quite surprised at the rude, abrasive way in which even young higher caste-men would address much older Dalit men – \"Enga vaa!\" [You, come here!], something unheard of today in Malaysia.\n\nA Transforming Malaysia\n\nChanging Patterns of Contact and Changing Communities\n\nInitially there were no phones in the estate [in Malaysia] or the village [in India]. People wrote letters occasionally. Sometimes, someone might come from there and they will say I met your mama or machan(uncle or brother-in-lawWhen phones came, you had to go to the post office and wait for up to two hours. If the line was free, then they would be able to connect. Sometimes even if you finally get the number in the estate, the person wouldn’t be there.\n\n22Since their early days as plantation workers, the Gounders in Malaysia have made substantial socioeconomic progress. Jain notes in his 1970 study of plantation life in Malaysia that whilst plantation workers were paid the same amount, some groups were able to become wealthier than others by deploying their modest income more effectively – \"The rich are those who not only work for money but also know how to make the money work for them\"(Jain, 1970). Some from the Gounder caste I interviewed claimed it was their innate caste ethic of saving and valuing education, as well as having money at the end of the month, rather than month at the end of the money that allowed them to get ahead of others. They would often lend out money to others who supposedly used their meagre incomes more lavishly on the limited entertainment in the estates, such as the toddy shop. However, it is important to remember that not all who arrived were as penniless as most of the Dalit workers of Paraiyar, Chakkliya, Pallar and other untouchable castes who left India with the hope of escaping a life of deprivation and abject poverty. Within a few generations, the Gounders, who were landowners and a farming caste in Tamil Nadu with experience and confidence in earning from the soil came to own vast tracts of land around Cameron Highlands in Pahang. Much of these large plots of land were bought at a time when uncultivated forest land was being made available solely for agricultural purposes for exceedingly low prices. Even other mid-level castes experienced substantial socio-economic progress in comparison to Dalit groups (who also had to deal with significant discrimination in the plantation setting), resulting in a \"broad correlation among estate Tamils between caste status (i.e., Adi Dravida Tamilians) and indices of backwardness, such as education level and poverty\"(Jain, 2003). The improved economic well-being resulted in some families from these mid-level caste groups sending money back to their families to buy land in their places of origin, even though trips back home were infrequent.\n\n23Between 1970s and 1990s, estate to urban migration accelerated. Families that had slowly improved their economic standing and importantly, educationlevels, moved to urban areas to take up higher-paying, more qualified jobs. Some of my informants whose parents were rubber tappers had occupations such as an assistant in a forestry institute, school teacher, local government officer and so on. Many of their own children took up tertiary studies seen as more prestigious in the Indian community such as law, medicine, engineering, and increasingly, IT and business degrees. Even today, professions such as medicine and law have a higher representation of Indians compared to the rest of the population although this is increasingly being challenged by the United Malays National Organisation UMNO-led government’s emphasis to produce larger cohorts of Malay professionals, often at the expense of other ethnic groups. What is less often seen or discussed is that most of these Indian professionals are from higher caste communities, with few from Adi Dravida backgrounds.\n\nIndians, Belonging and the New Economic Policy\n\n24The period from the 1970s also coincided with the implementation of the affirmative New Economic Policy (NEP) that favoured ethnic Malays over other ethnic groups, leaving the economic and social position of Indians vulnerable and in the hands of market forces, with very little social support from the government (Willford, 2006: 37). This has induced in them an increasing sense of alienation in the nation, despite the toil of their forefathers. The crux of the NEP has been an ideology that differentiates between the so-called \"sons of the soil\" or bumiputera Malay-Muslims and indigenous groups and non-bumiputeras comprised mostly of the Chinese and Indians. Instituted in 1971 after racial tensions and riots in 1969, the policy was aimed at addressing the economic disparity between the Malay and Chinese populations, due to the dominance of the latter in the national equity. The policy took the form of affirmative actions such as ethnic quotas for government jobs, university admissions, and public company ownership. In addition, bumiputeras were granted special privileges for home ownership, as well as government licenses and contracts reserved for Malays (Tong, 2010: 93). Despite Malaysia’s incorporation in the constitution as a secular state, in the period following the commencement of the NEP, the special position of Islam and Malay culture became an important factor in determining public policy and questions regarding national identity (Milner, 1998)\n\n25Whil the UMNO-led ruling coalition’s policy of favouring the bumiputeras has affected the poorest Indians the most in terms of the social and economic opportunities, even the middle-class increasingly profess a sense of disconnection and alienation. In recent decades, many qualified young Indian and Chinese professionals have begun to emigrate to countries like Australia or the UK. Interestingly, the same impetus that drives the flow outwards to estern countries has been accompanied by a desire to reconnect with India as well, often in religious ways. As Taylor argues referring to empirical data in Vietnam, \"For ethnic minority peoples who have been marginalized by state policies, religion is a way to obtain re-integration, autonomy and empowerment\" (2007b: 6). The rise in interest in kula devam worship during the last two decades goes beyond the surface-level transnational religiosity evident in the contemporaneous growth of pilgrimage-tourism to famous south Indian temple cities. The worship of ancestral deities in villages of origin can be seen as an attempt to search for one’s place in the world as descendants of poor labourers who find that even after a century, the Indians still do not have a home in Malaysia. It is in this context that return visits gain even more prominence. Here, Prakash describes the first time he arrived in Tamil Nadu in the late 1980s:\n\nVillage people all waiting at the airport! 50 over people waiting for me! All having malai [garlands] and all. God! When they saw me, they were hugging and crying. They arranged everything and took me to the kula devam temple as soon as I was settled. After the first trip, I always feel like must go and see kula devam and my relations. In Tamil, there is a saying, \"thaan adavitalum than sathai adum\" [Even if you don’t move, your flesh will move].\n\n26Whilst it may be tempting to read the quip about \"flesh relations\" in terms of the old axiom – blood is thicker than water – what is more interesting is how these moral values (Robbins, 2015)are not produced through an apriori bio-essentialist idea of kinship that Schneider (1984) critiques, but how ritual involvement and participation produces forms of relating to kinship through the experiences and feelings in those who return to their ancestral lands.\n\n27The surge in transnational religious networks involving ancestral deities coincides with the rise in availability of communication technology such as traditional phone lines in villages, followed by the explosion of mobile phone technology, internet and now smartphones, as well as the growing ease and lowered cost of travel. Among the expanding Indian middle-class that has benefited from higher education levels and qualifications, better paying jobs have led to higher levels of disposable income, which in turn have more frequent travel back to their ancestral lands. While some of them technically still had some authority or claim to the land through patrilineal rights, they have rarely tended to exercise those rights. At the same time, it is because of the very presence of a link to the land, either directly or through one’s relatives that they are able to think about the village in India as my villagea phrase uttered often, even by third or fourth-generation respondents. In Prakash’s account, it is evident how returning to the kula devam is at once an embracing of the kulam, the clan. The return home becomes strongly associated with an intense sense of belonging that is dependent on memories handed down several generations. This, of course, is only made possible by the historical role of the Gounders as a land-owning peasant caste, as opposed to the landless Dalits who worked in almost slave like conditions for centuries in their homeland (Viswanath, 2014). The Gounder situation is encapsulated in Carsten’s (2007: 20) argument:\n\nIt is not surprising that those who have historically made their living from the land, and who have a kinship history that is tied to a particular locality should vividly demonstrate the positive sources of identification that may be offered by the memory of successive generations living in the same place or returning to it after periods of absence.\n\n28In a transforming Malaysia saturated with increased risk and little state support – where Indians have begun to publicly and privately question their place in the country – we can see why this transnational identification with their distant clan and ancestral land become something that people begin to nurture. In many cases, middle-class Indians from higher castes who have re-forged these links have also begun to buy land in their ancestral villages or surrounding areas and towns, as well as invest in businesses. Travel and ease of business has been made even easier through the implementation of the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status for non-resident Indians in 2005 by the Government of IndiaIn the last decade this status has increasingly been adopted among those with ancestral links.\n\nThe Dalit Story. \"Convenient Kula Devams\"\n\n29The transformation of Malaysian society has affected different segments of the Indian population in contrasting ways. While many Indian families moved from plantations to urban centres to pursue better paying professions and educational opportunities for their children, such internal migration was not always voluntary. Malaysia’s rapid march into modernity and the shift from agriculture to industry was accompanied by massive upheaval of proletarian, landless Indians in the estates, many from Dalit groups. Less-qualified Indians started moving out of the estates enmasse, many into urban slums (kampungs) and low-cost apartments. Work had become precarious ue to falling rubber prices, a national strategy to switch from rubber to the less labour-intensive oil palms, and advancs in technology as well as a massive influx of contract workers from other countries. In many cases, entire plantations made way for large urban development projects, forcing people out of estates they had lived in for decades. For segments of the Indian population who lacked the education or skills to flourish elsewhere, it meant the loss of the comfortable familiarity of the estate, its slow-paced lifestyle, and the community-oriented living centred on estate temples. In comparison, the outside world – the great unknown was fraught with risk.\n\n30The growth of Dengkil, the town in which the temple gathering I described at the beginning of this article occurred, exemplifies these changes. Dengkil lies only 20 minutes from Putrajaya, the custom-built administrative capital of Malaysia. It has grown exponentially in recent decades as four plantations the largest of which was Perang Besar estate comprising thousands of acres were cleared in the 1990s for the development in Putrajaya, as well as the nearby new IT city, Cyberjaya. Indians from these estates moved to Dengkil and surrounding areas, many into low-cost housing projects well outside Putrajaya and Cyberjaya, which were branded as futuristic, utopian new-age smart cities (Bunnell, 2004). Within a decade, these low-cost housing projects with poor amenities are literally crumbling with large cracks running through the apartments as well as facades.\n\n31I met Muthu, 28, at the Sri Jada Veera Kali Sanngli Muneeswaran temple on the outskirts of Dengkil. In 1997, Muthu’s family was evicted from the Perang Besar estate. Speaking in Tamil, he said:\n\nMy grandfather’s father came to Malaya [in the 1930s]. He was a rubber tapper, my grandfather was a rubber tapper, my father was a rubber tapper. Then when they made Putrajaya, they pushed us out…Nobody cares about us. You saw the fellows at the temple, some have got work near the airport, some are cleaning, some are running lorries, some are stealing iron, you think the government cares about us? We need to do whatever we can to survive.\n\n32Muthu came from a Dalit background. He worked at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as a baggage handler, a job he had found recently after working as a cleaner for several years. As it turns out, it was not just Guna, the lorry operator mentioned at the beginning of the article, who worshipped the Muneeswaran deity at the temple as his kula devam. Muthu and his fatheralso frequently visited the temple to perform bali tarpanam - rituals for the well-being of his ancestors on Amavasi\". A priest said we must regularly perform prayers for ancestors and kula devam, if your ancestors and kula devamare happy, then your life will be good,\" Muthuexplained\n\n33I asked him about his kula devam and he said that in the past, his family did not worship a kula devam as such, but instead went to the main Mariamman temple at Perang Besar estate to pray. They had gone to a priest because Muthu's family had a lot of problemsBoth of his father’s two brothers died – one from a drinking problem, and the other, an accident. Muthu’s brother and cousins were involved in gangs and his brother even spent some time in jail. On the advice of the priest and remembering that his own father (Muthu’s grandfather) used to occasionally worship Muniandy, Muthu’s father began performing kula devam rites at a small Muniandy temple near the estate. According to Muthu, that Muniandy temple was torn down by government officials, along with at least 15 other temples around the estates. All of them destroyed (ellam odachittanga), he frowned. Since then, they had come to this temple because it was the most \"convenient\" for them as it was the nearest Muneeswaran kovil. \"Has your kula devam worship been helpful?\" I queried.\n\nI believe in Ayya. He hasa lot of power (sakthi). People say I am lucky to get a job at KLIA…But I still don’t know if we are praying to our own kula devam. One astrologer we saw when my brother was in jail said we need to find our kula devam in India and he [the kula devam] is angry that we have not performed any rituals for so many generations. That is why all these bad things are happening. Even if we pray to Ayya, if kula devam anger (kopam) is there, what is the use?\n\n34The uncertainty in Muthu’s words comes from a lack of clarity about the real ancestral deity that was venerated by his ancestors. If the kula devam gives the Gounders a sense of ontological security(Giddens, 1991)in a transforming world, the corollary is true for Muthu and his lost kula devam.\n\n35A few days later, I met Bala, the father of one of Muthu’s friend’s, an outspokenand politically astute man in his 60s. He had established a shrine for the fearsome warrior god, Madurai Veeran, in the front yard of his home near the former Ampar Tenang tea and rubber estate in Dengkil. Bala did not see any need to go back to India to worship his kula devam.\n\nOne thing, I don’t know where my village is. Somewhere near Karur [in Tamil Nadu], I don’t know. My father came here when he was 20, a long time before independence. He lived here [in Malaysia] for 55 years and he never went back…My ancestors (munnorkal) were slaves (adimai). Why would I go back? Why will I take my son there so he can see the atrocity (kotumai) there even today? In Malaysia they thought they could escape it all but even after coming here, people are saying, \"that guy is this caste and that caste (avan indha jati, andha jati)\". If you look at MIC [Malaysian Indian Congress], it’s all caste politics, even today.\n\n37It is not uncommon to hear of those who practice this kind of Tamil ritualism, which the Malaysia Hindu Sangam has been attempting to stamp out, being labelled as \"estate people\" or \"estate types.\" This, of course, is interesting because a substantial majority of Malaysian Indians, including those of higher castes, have had links to estates where the early migrants in their families had settled. Here, \"estate types\" becomes an everyday parlance for \"low caste,\" people whose behaviour as well as ritual practices are seen as \"uncouth, uncultured and unsophisticated.\" One of my more self-reflective urban informants, a writer from the Saiva Vellalar Pillai caste, describes this constant not-so-subtle looking down on \"estate types\": \"When I was growing up, I would often hear phrases like: ‘He was behaving like a real Muniandy, shouting and carrying on’ or when girls and young women dance in public in an unseemly way, people would say, 'They’re doing the Chakkli kutthu.’\" Here, the phrase \"Chakkli kutthu\" is used to signify an uncultured dance of the untouchable Chakkliyan caste, as opposed to the more restrained word for dance – natanam or even aatam.\n\n38In the above remark, the association of \"estate types\" with Muniandy, who in many places has become transformed into the higher status Muneeswaran and is an immensely popular god in the Malaysian and Singaporean diaspora (Sinha, 2005), indicate an interesting contradiction from the view of middle-class Indians. Some upper-caste Malaysian Hindus such as the Gounders (whose castes deities are mainly forms of the goddess Amman) even point out other minor guardian deities like Madhurai Veeran as belonging to the lower castes, especially the Chakkliyan or the Paraiyars. Whilst it is true that in the colonial era publication of Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Madhurai Veeran is recorded as one of the tutelary deities propitiated by those of Paraiyar caste, the deity is equally popular among the Kallars, just as Muneeswaran is also a common clan deity for the Mudaliyars (Thurston, Rangachari, 1909). In fact, mid-level castes have always prayed to these kaval devam in Malaysia, particularly in the estate context. However, in recent years among the urban mid-level castes, the same non-Sanskritic practices which were common in estates such as animal sacrifices, sami aatam [trance] and so on, have come to be associated with the low caste origins of their ancestors, while the \"caste Hindus\" valiantly try to \"reform\" Hinduism. In the case of India, a similar push towards a rational religion was formed by the confluence of ideas between the secular colonial state, and Hindu reform movements inspired by Christian missions (Van der Veer, 2009). In Malaysia it has specifically arisen as a response by middle and upper-class members of a marginalised minority community, to an increasingly Islamised state and population that has come to be critical of \"odd\" non-Islamic practices.\n\n39It is in this context that the primary question obsessed over by the Malaysia Hindu Sangam and the upper caste reformers is \"how will our religion be seen by others [that is, the Malays]?\" For those from Dalit backgrounds, who bear the brunt of criticism about their practices, this can be a source of intense annoyance. As one of my Dalit informants quipped: \"Whichever way I want to pray, why does he [the high-caste Hindu] care so much? (Naan eppidi kumbitalum, avannakku ethukku ivulam akkarai?)\"\n\nConclusion\n\n41The fact that hundreds of ancient village temples in Tamil Nadu are being linked to Southeast Asia through a revitalisation of ritual ties, and possibly serving as a future conduit for rural, non-urban sensibilities to do with caste, along with economic and capital flows – no doubt makes for interesting reading within the field of transnationalism. However, the \"deterritorialization,\" the \"loosening of bonds\" between people and territories (Appadurai, 1990, 1991; Basch, Glick Schiller, Blanc-Szanton, 1994), which is so fundamental to ideas about transnationalism and flows across borders, relies on a presupposition – the presence of a territory to deterritorialize from. It is an idea that fails in the case of the Dalit, historical landless bonded labourers whose bodies even were not their own territory. Thus, a view of the transnational that looks not only at visible links of rituals, kinship and exchange, but also the invisible – of networks that do not emerge – tells a tale that goes beyond ritual revitalisation; a tale of neglected memories, forgotten Gods and historical deprivation, and how the present is intimately related to the past."
