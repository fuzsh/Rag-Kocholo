        "text": "A man can not change his gothram, per definition of it. Gothram represents the passing down of 'Y' Chromosome from one of the original rishis through the males (females do not carry this chromosome).\n\nAs Sri Ramachandran Ji pointed out elsewhere, males through their sperms give 'soul' to a person as the mother's egg only provides for physical body (this is the belief). So, gothram is identified for the males to worship one's forefathers who have given us the 'souls'. Again this is the belief.\n\nSir,\n\nI have actuallly been wondering why did this belief come up (of women not giving 'soul' to the child, being silent spectator in creation, and so on) for quite some time now. Honestly, it still does not make sense to me (since both a man and woman play an equal role in 'creating life'). Only wish we had a system where men and women are both considered equally important to a child (just in case it is not considered that way).\n\nWhat i have been thinking is that 'perhaps' the male pithrus need to be appeased because there are many more y-chromosome linked mutations passed on as diseases than x-linked ones (which in fact are few, 'mothers' seem to be fairly harmless in the survival scenario). Men in fact are supposedly the weaker sex in terms of being prone to a lot more health conditions than women. And perhaps that is why the male side needs to be 'worshipped', to placate 'it', appease 'it', so that some divinity or 'modificational energy' is invoked to ensure healthy generations.\n\nI was also talking to one monk asking him why villages are gothrams for some people. He said that in the old times branches of rishi gothras started being named after a prominent person, like someone who established a branch of the same people in an other place. This was to accomodate growth in population. When populations grew, many sub-branches, sub-sub-branches and further divisions kept getting established. By this time, people had spread out in 'far off' places.\n\nWhen numbers grew even more, and people branched away further, villages started being used to identify a branch (since the branches wud create and settle in new villages, the village names became an identifier). Naturally everyone in the village wud not be doing same occupation, but they wud be the same gothra. Over time many people in various occupations forgot their gothras, except the ones that needed to remember it or mention it during prayers. It was for this reason, that when people reverted to hindu after being buddhist or jain, they took on village names as gothras, since that was acceptable in hindusim at that time as a gotra branch identifier. Therefore one sees all kinds of gotras being mentioned during archanai (like names of rishis, names of gods like Shiva and Vishnu, some ancestor names, village names, etc as a gothras).\n\nMethinks this whole idea of using village names is common in the old southindian names, not seen in the north. Many northies also do not have gothras (while performing a homam, it is common for a priest to mention his own gothra or give his own gothra to the client, since many northies were filled in as the 'kshatriya' group). So it maybe possible that this old gotra system, as mentioned by the monk, was created and followed in southindia or by people who later came to be called southern-indians.\n\nIt may also be possible that a section of the northies were actually matrilineal tribes (among some punjabis the mother whispers the name of the child into the baby's ear thrice during namakaranam, not the father); though they are actually considered patrilineal people (did this crossing over of becoming patrilineal happen in the puranic times ?). Also many southies do have a village name affixed to their name but profess non-village gothras like vashista, vishwamitra, kashyapa, etc...probably this too happened in the puranic times..its like old wine filled in a new bottle or like naming a child back again after one of his ancestors after 2k generations perhaps.\n\nAnyways, all this is based on conversations with a guru. I have no way to autheticate it.\n\nDear Sri Pbkhema-ji,\n\nI think you are refering to the gothra system as instituted in the puranic times by the dharmashastras.\n\nI do not think gotras mean biological descendency. If so, then there must some match between people who profess the same gothra, same shakha, atleast in the same linguistic group. Instead, i think most part of the present day gotras are from spiritual decendency or guru-shishya parampara.\n\nRegarding the branching of various gotras into various sub-units, sub-sub-units and further branches all the way to village names, i am probably talking of what was the older gotra system, though i have no means of authenticating it.\n\nIf you go to a temple and find someone is mentioning Shiva or Vishnu as a gotra, probably they are reffereing to their thalaivar or person who established them, a branch of people in a new settelement. One set from that branch may have gone on to create another village someplace else, after several branches in between. And that village name may be professed as the gothra of those people.\n\nWhat it all does boil down to, is that all share the same forefathers, though am not sure they shared the same foremother.\n\nHowever, ages before all these things developed, humans worldwide descended from just one mother, dubbed the mitochondrial eve, who was from Africa.\n\nDear Shri Vivekanand,\n\nThere are ppl who can make money out of sentiments (there is a company that has only 49 established gotras..)\n\nPlease don't be taken for a ride.\n\nI quote a review mentioned on a site:\n\nThe DNA analysis concluded that I descended from a male ancestor that belonged to haplogroup R1a1, an Indo-European genetic type that most likely originated in Central-Eastern Europe and dispersed east as far as India, my paternal ancestral home. These Indo-European nomads thousands of years ago became the ancestors of the present day Brahmin caste of India from which I confirmed through DNA Consultants that I descended from. Coincidently or even mysteriously my family friends in Madras (present day Chenai), the Krishnans who are Kashappa Iyer Brahmins had given me their particular Gotram title when I was initiated as a Brahmin in a ritual ceremony called an Upanayam years ago before marriage. However I was unaware that my Bengali surname Sanyal was connected to the same Kashappa Gotram that I was initiated into, until my DNA Gotram results were made available which facilitated me in further research. The results and history given by Dr. Yates enabled me to learn more about my Brahmanic heritage, and to gain an insight on my paternal history and compare the findings with other R1a1 South Asian Brahmins.\n\nplease read this in context of india: http://www.dadamo.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1a1_(Y-DNA)\n\nA few things not explained:\n\n1) How can anyone with R1a1 (m17) be Kashyap gothra? So are men from Chenchus, Badagas, Irulas with r1a1 are all kashyapa gothra?\n\n2) On waht basis was a gothra assigned to a person as kashyap based on r1a1 ?\n\n3) there seems to be no link b/w the recent central asian entrants (nomads) and the earlier entrants that gave rise to the vedic cultures...\n\nLets us say tehre are 2 iyers, both bharadhwaja, same shakha, unrelated, one living in bangalore and another living in madras. The possibility of them both being realted is as much as a kallar from vellore and a kallar from kanyakumari. The bangalorean iyer will probably be more similar to the people of his region and the madras iyer will be more similar to the other madras residents. And if two people of the same caste were to live in the same region, the possibility of them both being related to each other cud be as much as those of other communities being related to either of them...there are very many possibilities...am sure it wud make for a very interesting study..\n\nRe : gothram\n\nyes Happy Hindu\n\nYou are right, there are lot of test centres which run for business rather than for scientific purposes. To validate about all this lot of data needs to be collected and proved, otherwise it is difficult to conclude, especially on lineages and human migrations.\n\nCiao\n\nAnand\n\nDear Shri Vivekanand,\n\nThere are ppl who can make money out of sentiments (there is a company that has only 49 established gotras..)\n\nPlease don't be taken for a ride.\n\nI quote a review mentioned on a site:\n\nplease read this in context of india: http://www.dadamo.com/wiki/wiki.pl/Haplogroup_R1a1_(Y-DNA)\n\nA few things not explained:\n\n1) How can anyone with R1a1 (m17) be Kashyap gothra?

I am not an expert, but it is wise to go with existing practices provided they do not inflict any known damage to the human race. I think we are far more inferior in knowledge, when compared to the previous ages.\n\nAll planets have an influence on each other - that is what the horoscope is all about. Days and nights are again dependent on the movement of planets. Hence types of works are seggregated based on the planet.\n\nPerforming a marriage is not the same as fighting a battle; neither can it be compared to construction of a house nor digging a well. The fundamental qualities, actions and results required for each of the above are different. Hence, days, based on their planetary deity, are chosen which has the optimum positive influence for required qualities.\n\nAs regards months for marriage - Margazhi is purely devoted to god; they do perform marriages in Karthigai, but before the Maha Deepam.\n\nWe have taken a 180 degree turn on our life sytles, habits and beliefs. Hence such practices would naturally seem to be superstitious.\n\nThe old pretence of being liberal\n\nPatent it blind, blame the scriptural\n\nSearch for it, not in general\n\nBut in practices, and the literal\n\nBound by the heavenly planets eternal\n\nScripting their journey, a guiding journal\n\nThe wise use with sapience internal\n\nCall it blind, ain't mind nocturnal?"
