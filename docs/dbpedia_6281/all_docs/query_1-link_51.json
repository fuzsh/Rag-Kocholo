        "text": "John Grisham, author of The Whistler\n\nWhat happens when a judge bends the law or takes a bribe? Lacy Stoltz is an investigator for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct, and a corruption case crosses her desk. A previously disbarred lawyer is back in business as Greg Myers; he claims to know of a judge who was secretly involved with the construction of a large casino on Native American land. Greg’s only client is a person who knows the truth and wants to blow the whistle and collect millions under Florida law. Lacy immediately suspects this case could be dangerous --- but it also could turn out to be deadly.\n\nRead more »\n\nWeek of July 10, 2017\n\nPaperback releases for the week of July 10th include John Grisham's THE WHISTLER, a high-stakes thrill ride through the darkest corners of the Sunshine State; MY NOT SO PERFECT LIFE, Sophie Kinsella's novel that is part love story and part workplace drama, a witty critique of the false judgments we make in a social-media-obsessed world; THE CHEMIST by Stephenie Meyer, in which an ex-agent on the run from her former employers must take one more case to clear her name and save her life; and THE DOLLHOUSE, Fiona Davis' debut novel that pulls readers into the lush world of New York City's glamorous Barbizon Hotel for Women, where in the 1950s a generation of aspiring models, secretaries and editors lived side by side while attempting to claw their way to fairy-tale success, and where a present-day journalist becomes consumed with uncovering a dark secret buried deep within the Barbizon's glitzy past.\n\nRead more »"
