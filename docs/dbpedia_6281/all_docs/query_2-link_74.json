        "text": "From the best-selling author of countless legal thrillers, former lawyer John Grisham has done it again with this riveting thrill ride through Florida's justice system. The richly complex plot has plenty of twists and turns involving a corrupt judge, bribes, gangsters and even homicide in a dangerous game that could soon turn deadly.\n\nThe most corrupt judge in US history. A young investigator with a secret informant. The electrifying new thriller.\n\nLacy Stoltz never expected to be in the firing line. Investigating judicial misconduct by Florida's 1,000 judges, her cases so far have been relatively unexciting. That's until she meets Greg Myers, an indicted lawyer with an assumed name who has an extraordinary tale to tell.\n\nMyers is representing a whistle-blower who knows of a judge involved in organised crime. Along with her gangster associates, this judge has facilitated the building of a casino on an Indian reservation. At least two people who opposed the scheme are dead.\n\nSince the casino was built, the judge has made several fortunes off undeclared winnings. She owns property around the world, she hires private jets to take her where she wishes, and her secret vaults are overflowing with rare books, art and jewels. No one has a clue what she's been doing - until now.\n\nUnder Florida law those who help the state recover illegally acquired assets stand to gain a large percentage of them. Myers and his whistle-blower friend could make millions. But first they need Lacy to start an investigation. Is she ready to pit herself against the most corrupt judge in American history, a judge whose associates think nothing of murder?"
