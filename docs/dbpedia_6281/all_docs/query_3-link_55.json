        "text": "[Updated August 28, 2024]\n\nMore so than Thanos, he was inevitable.\n\nStepping out on to stage among a cadre of Doombots, Robert Downey Jr. wowed 6500 of the Marvel Studios faithful at Comic-Con International: San Diego 2024 by revealing himself as the new face of Doctor Doom — the premiere Marvel villain and the new big bad of the ongoing saga set to culminate with the next two Avengers films in 2026 and 2027. But the actor’s return to the Marvel fold represents a course correction underscored by Downey’s quote: “new mask, same task.”\n\nThe story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Studios itself has been a tumultuous one since the release of Avengers: Endgame. The Phase Four films and television shows left audiences wondering if there was a new saga at all. The need to generate material for Disney+ also left many feeling the studio was unfocused and overextended. At SDCC 2022, studio president Kevin Feige tried to quell some of these misgivings by revealing the full calendar for Phases Five and Six, labeling the whole thing as “The Multiverse Saga.”\n\nBut almost as soon as the Multiverse calendar was made public, alterations were made. Movies shifted release dates and production schedules. Two industry strikes forced all television and movie production to grind to halt. Disney itself changed its priorities and instructed Marvel to slow its pipeline. And the expected big bad of the new saga, Kang the Conqueror, proved unimpressive in his true debut appearance — Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — while the actor who portrayed him faced criminal charges in New York. He was ultimately let go from his Marvel contract, but it was unclear if Kang would carry on or be completely replaced with a difference character. And it just so happened that Doom seemed to be the logical replacement…\n\nIt all reveals that, despite the planning involved, Marvel Studios is malleable and ready to alter those plans if need be.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the MCU, heroes must rise, ne’er-do-wells must do what they do, and Marvel’s First Family must get ready for their moment in the spotlight. And, as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s projects through 2027 (and beyond).\n\nAs always, we will continue to update this page frequently as new details emerge. And be careful: There are spoilers ahead. (Want to see what the other camp is up to? Check out our full breakdown of upcoming DC Studios movies.)\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT NEXT\n\nThe SDCC 2024 presentation was full of bombast — from a Deadpool choir singing “Like A Prayer” to the Downey reveal — but was surprisingly short on words like “phase”, “Multiverse”, and “saga.” Consequently, it is unclear if that system of notation is still in place. What you can expect in lieu of phases are three films set for release in 2025 with an air of espionage and, later, family. Also, there are a few TV shows readying for release that may still matter to the ongoing threads of Marvel storytelling…\n\nAgatha All Along (series)\n\nPremiere Date: September 18, 2024\n\nWhat We Know: The series will see Kathryn Hahn return as lovable witch Agatha Harkness. Thanks to a trailer that debuted in July, we know the story will pick up with Agatha trapped in some sort of hex, living as a homicide detective, until a “suspicious goth teen” breaks her out of it. In order to regain her powers, she will have to embark on “the legendary Witches’ Road, a magical gauntlet of trials that, if survived, rewards a witch with what they’re missing.”\n\nWandaVision’s Jac Schaeffer serves as head writer, so maybe the series will also lean on single-character spinoff shows like Rhoda and Frasier for inspiration. At the 2022 Comic-Con presentation, Feige unveiled the series’ first title. In subsequent months, Emma Caulfield (reprising her WandaVision role), Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, and Ali Ahn joined the cast. Other actors set to appear include Debra Jo Rupp (also returning as the character glimpsed in WandaVision), Patti LuPone as Lilia Calderu, and Sasheer Zamata as Jennifer Kale – the latter two of whom are both established magic users in Marvel Comic lore. Trey Sartorius will reportedly play a character named “Nate Richards” who may be very important to the Multiverse Saga. Directing duties are split between Schaeffer, Gandja Monteiro, and Rachel Goldberg. Production was seemingly completed before the strikes began, although additional shooting may have occurred afterward. In September of 2023, Marvel changed the show’s subtitle from Coven of Chaos to Darkhold Diaries. In 2024, the name changed again to Agatha All Along with a planed September debut. Completely absent from that year’s SDCC festivities, the show made a spectacular appearance at the 2024 D23 Entertainment Showcase. The cast took to the stage to sing one of the program’s new songs and back in the expo hall, a walkthrough experience themed to the Time Variance Authority revealed some of the shows’ witchy costumes.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: With Blade, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Werewolf By Night, the increasing horror elements making their way into the MCU may be best explored by someone cloaked in traditional witchy trappings. Agatha just happens to fit that description perfectly. Of course, the possibility of a Nate Richards appearance also means the series will have Multiversal implications. Well, if they still want variants of that character running around.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again (series)\n\nPremiere Date: 2025\n\nWhat We Know: Although Charlie Cox teased knowing “some things” Marvel had in store for his character during interviews following his Spider-Man: No Way Home cameo, it was unclear if this meant further guest appearances or a return to fulltime duty as the Daredevil of Hell’s Kitchen. It will be the latter with word finally breaking in mid-May 2022 that Marvel Studios was indeed developing a Daredevil series for Disney+. The Enemy Within‘s Matt Corman and Chris Ord served as executives producers on the program, which was described at the time as both a new iteration of Daredevil and continuing from stories told in the Netflix series. Cox returns as Matt Murdoch with Vincent D’Onofrio joining him as Wilson Fisk. At the time, Elden Henson, Deborah Ann Woll, and Wilson Bethel were not expected to return as their respective characters. At the 2022 Comic-Con presentation, Feige also mentioned the series will be Marvel Studios’ first 18-episode production. Michael Gandolfini, Margarita Levieva, and Sandrine Holt joined the cast in December of 2022. The following month, Nikki M. James also joined up while Arrowverse veterans Jill Blakenship and Grainne Godfree became part of the writing staff. Their hiring reinforced comments made by Feige about making some of the Marvel shows more episodic. In March of 2023, reports surfaced indicating Jon Bernthal was returning as The Punisher. Holt, meanwhile, took over as Fisk’s wife, Vanessa, from Ayelet Zurer of the Netflix-era series. Additionally, veteran Homeland director Michael Cuesta helmed the first episode and Arty Froushan was said to appear as Harry, an unconfirmed but reportedly pivotal role. Production on the series was interrupted and ultimately suspended as the strikes of 2023 continued.\n\nAs they were resolved over the Fall, news emerged indicating the writing staff and directing teams were fired and as Marvel rethought the program to more closely resemble the Netflix Daredevil series. While some of the material shot prior to the strike will be retained, it appears the program will be very different from Corman and Ord’s original plans. Punisher veteran Dario Scardapane took their place as head writer while Moon Knight and Loki‘s Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead assumed directing duties. Among all of the changes, though, came confirmation that the program will continue into a second season. When filming resumed in early 2024, fans were pleased to see photos of Bethel, Woll, and Henson emerging from the set, confirming the three will appear in the program when it debuts in Spring of 2025. In May of 2024, Cox confirmed there will be “a lot” of crossover with the older Daredevil series and the MCU, adding that the balance of both will please fans.\n\nAbsent from Marvel’s SDCC 2024 panel, the main cast — including Bernthal as a now-confirmed-to-return Punisher — made a quick appearance at that year’s D23 Entertainment Showcase. From a teaser shown during the presentation, it appears Matt is called into service as people keep disappearing in New York, Fisk enacts a new plan, and White Tiger (the late Kamar de los Reyes) makes his presence known.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Unlike the other Marvel Studios television projects, Daredevil is unique as it will seemingly cannonize stories that, while meant to be part of the MCU, always felt a universe or two away. Will it bring the other Defenders back as well? With 18-episode worth of time to fill, there may be a chance for the other street level heroes to chart their own new status quos in the MCU.\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World (2025)\n\nRelease Date: February 14, 2025\n\nWhat We Know: Immediately following the final episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, news broke of series writers Malcolm Spellman and Dalan Musson beginning work on a script for the fourth Captain America film. It will continue with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie, who closed his deal to star in August of 2021) as Cap and how he fulfills the role in a world recovering from various calamities. In July 2022, The Cloverfield Paradox‘s Julius Onah emerged as the film’s director. Feige subsequently revealed the film’s title and release date at the 2022 Comic-Con presentation. At the D23 Expo that September, he revealed The Incredible Hulk‘s Tim Blake Nelson will return as The Leader and in the proceeding weeks, Disney confirmed a persistent rumor that Harrison Ford would replace the late William Hurt as recurring MCU character Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross. In February of 2023, Marvel announced Ross will be the newly elected President of the United States in the film. The next month, Liv Tyler signed to return as Ross’s daughter, Betty — a role she has not played since 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. In June of that year, Marvel announced a new subtitle — Brave New World — and pushed its release date to July 2024, which then shifted to May. After the conclusion of the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Disney moved the film, which already completed production, to 2025 as part of ongoing effort to slow down Marvel’s release schedule and post-production bottlenecks. The change was not without issue, as an unmovable toy promotion with McDonald’s led to depictions of certain unconfirmed characters finding their way into collectors’ hands and social media. At SDCC 2024, the film’s cast introduced a scene from the film in which President Ross discusses an international issue and how it led to the discovery of adamantium — a new element in the MCU. A subsequent scene also saw Ross asking Sam to re-form the Avengers. The sizzle reel ended with Ross going full Red Hulk — although we’re still not sure if Ford knows what that means. Additionally, Giancarlo Esposito offered the name of his mysterious character: Seth Voelker, aka Sidewinder, the king of the film’s antagonistic Serpent Society.\n\nThe actor thanked the fans who memed him into different Marvel characters for helping to open lines of communication with the studio. He also spoke with us about the role following the SDCC presentation:\n\nThe footage and Mackie’s unmatched enthusiasm occurred again two weeks later at the D23 Disney Entertainment Showcase.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: The scenes shown at SDCC 2024 directly concern the lack of an Avengers team and the fallout from the Celestial corpse left in the Pacific Ocean following the events of Eternals. We also expect a few callbacks to The Falcon and the Winter Soldier with both Keith David and Danny Ramirez reprising their roles from that series. Also, as Captain America movies tend to serve as anchors for the MCU, we expect the film will establish what Earth is like five or so years after the Blip.\n\nThunderbolts (2025)\n\nRelease Date: May 2, 2025\n\nWhat We Know: In June of 2022, Deadline reported Robot & Frank‘s Jake Schreier will direct a Thunderbolts film — the project itself proving to be something of a surprise at the time. Eric Pearson was writing the script based on the Marvel team of anti-heroes, but Beef creator Lee Sung Jin replaced him in March 2023. In the comic book’s original premise, Baron Zemo assembled a group of villains to masquerade as a superhero team and supplant the Avengers. But once Zemo’s true plan was revealed, the Thunderbolts became a semi-heroic squad with a more flexible immorality. During the D23 Expo in September of 2023, Feige revealed the team’s roster: Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) , Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), US Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko). Ford was also said to appear as Ross, but comments made during Marvel’s 2024 SDCC panel suggest this may no longer be the case. In January of 2023, Ayo Edebiri joined the cast with Steven Yeun signing up a month later — Invincible creator Robert Kirkman later claimed Yeun would play Sentry, a Marvel equivalent to Superman. This later became moot as Yuen left the production in January 2024 citing scheduling conflicts. Edebiri also exited the film shortly thereafter. Lewis Pullman and Geraldine Viswanathan replaced the two actors, respectively. Both were strangely mute about their characters at SDCC 2024. Originally slated for a December 2024 release, Disney pushed the film to July 2025 following the industry strikes and the continued effort to spread Marvel projects out into 2027. In February of 2024, the film moved once again to a May 2025 release date, swapping dates with Fantastic Four. In April of 2024, the film added an asterisk to its title, with Feige teasing the meaning of Thunderbolts* would be clear after the film’s release. He reiterated that notion alongside Schreier and most of the cast during their SDCC 2024 appearance. The group also presented a clip featuring several members of the team meeting for the first time and a depressed Yelena trying to chat with a potentially-also-depressed Red Guardian. The scenes shown continue the spy feel of Brave New World, but with a decidedly less serious bent. That vibe was also on display as the cast came to the stage and Harbour chose to appear as Red Guardian. Curiously, the film was not featured during Marvel’s segment at the D23 Entertainment Showcase.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Beyond the possibility of Zemo (Daniel Brühl) secretly organizing an Avengers all his own, the notion of a Thunderbolts in the MCU seems tailor-made to explain the appearances and behavior of the Contessa. Also: will they be called upon to truly replace the Avengers when Doom (or some other Thanos-level antagonist) finally makes good on their threat? Considering the film calendar Feige revealed in 2022, we have to wonder if the Thunderbolts will utterly fail, forcing a new Avengers to form. Or, perhaps, Kamala Khan’s (Iman Vellani) younger group.\n\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)\n\n(Photo by )\n\nRelease Date: July 25, 2025\n\nWhat We Know: At the 2019 Comic-Con, Feige merely mentioned he “ran out of time” to discuss the Fantastic Four or mutants. While both concepts will eventually make their way into the MCU, we expected that integrating Marvel’s first family would be the priority. And like many on the internet have suggested, they will debut in an alternate 1960s — an elegant way to introduce them and acknowledge their absence in the prime MCU all this time. In that context, they also serve as a great replacement for the similarly time-lost Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). In December of 2020, Marvel announced Spider-Man: Far From Home director Jon Watts would helm the project, but then announced his departure in April 2022, just a week or so shy of John Kransinski making a cameo as Reed Richards in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Some expected him to direct the movie. The actor did not appear at the 2022 Comic-Con presentation and Feige said little else about the film beyond its release date and place as the Phase 6 opener. At the subsequent D23 Expo, he confirmed WandaVision‘s Matt Shakman would direct the film. Shortly thereafter, Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer signed on to write the script. In March of 2022, Avatar: The Way of Water‘s Josh Friedman came aboard to write a new draft. And after years of speculation, Pedro Pascal emerged in November 2023 as the actor to play the Cursed Richards. In February of 2024, Marvel confirmed Pascal will indeed be Mr. Fantastic with Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach joining him as the rest of the team. Filming began at the end of July. Other cast members include Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, and Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer. Additionally, Ralph Ineson will play Galactus, who fans at SDCC 2024 caught a glimpse of thanks to a pre-filming sizzle reel the cast brought with them from London. The reel also gave those in attendance a sneak peak at Galactus, Pascal’s voice for Reed, and the fabulous Fantasticar, a piece of tech ripped straight from the comics that looks quite at home in the retro-futurist ’60s of the film. Also, Feige confirmed the film will be titled The Fantastic Four: First Steps and that Michael Giacchino will provide the score.\n\nFollowing the panel, Pascal and Kirby offered us some thoughts on the film’s period setting:\n\nThe pre-filmming reel was shown again at the D23 Entertainment Showcase, scoring a bigger response when Galactus appeared on screen. Although, that may have to do with the venue holding twice the audience of Comic-Con’s Hall H.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: The Fantastic Four bring with them a surprisingly robust rouges gallery. To be honest, we’re a little more excited to see Doom, Annihilus, and Galactus make their MCU introductions than the Richards clan. Nevertheless, that alternate 1960s is something we’re excited to see even if it is in a variant Marvel universe.\n\nPHASE SIX AND BEYOND\n\nAs revealed at the SDCC 2022 presentation, Phase Six was to begin with Fantastic Four and conclude with a two-part Avengers film series sprawling into 2027. It is unclear if phases are still part of the plan, but for the moment we’re holding onto the nomenclature for all the projects set for release after Fantastic Four until Feige offers an update on this aspect of the Marvel Method.\n\nIronheart (series)\n\n(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, © Marvel Studios)\n\nPremiere Date: 2025\n\nWhat We Know: Based on the character introduced into Marvel comics by Brian Michael Bendis and artist Mike Deodato (with a subsequent redesign by Eve Ewing and Kevin Libranda), Riri Williams (Dominque Thorne) is a robotics genius who builds a suit of armor more advanced than anything Tony Stark devised in his lifetime. But she is forced to recreate it when Queen Shuri (Letitia Wright) forbids her from taking it back to the United States. That second attempt gets her expelled from college, so she is forced to team up with a Chicagoland enigma known as the Hood to get the fund and resources to finish the new suit. In April of 2021, word broke indicating poet and Snowpiercer veteran Chinaka Hodge will serve as the program’s head writer and executive producer. The following February, Anthony Ramos joined the cast as the MCU’s version of The Hood while Lyric Ross also joined as Riri’s best friend. That April, Ryan Coogler’s Proximity production company signed on to produce while Blindspotting‘s Angela Barnes and Dear White People‘s Sam Bailey climbed aboard to direct. Additional cast members added in the summer of 2022 include Manny Montana, Shea Couleé, and Alden Ehrenreich in a key role. Although already filmed, reports in February of 2023 indicated the series would move to a 2024 release as Disney and Marvel sought to slow the output of both films and television. In June of 2023, Anji White emerged as another member of the cast. Eventually, a rumor suggesting the series would be delayed to 2025 was confirmed by Disney in mid-2024.\n\nAt the 2024 D23 Entertainment Showcase, the series emerged once more into the light with Coogler professing his love for Riri as a character, saying “I always knew she had more to her story.” A sizzle reel for the series also indicated it may be one of the more grounded MCU television shows even if Riri succeeds in building her armor.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Riri debuted in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Considering she is one of the younger Marvel characters, we imagine she will cross paths with Kamala and Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld) before too long. Also, with her connection to Stark, we think she will be part of the upcoming Armor Wars feature in some fashion (more on that project below).\n\nBlade (2025)\n\n(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, © Marvel Studios)\n\nRelease Date: November 7, 2025\n\nWhat We Know: Feige stunned the 2019 Comic-Con crowd by announcing Mahershala Ali will be the MCU’s version of Blade. Early on, Stacy Osei-Kuffour signed up to write the project with Feige admitting it will be a PG-13 affair. In July of 2021, word broke indicating Bassam Tariq will direct the picture. In November of 2021, Delroy Lindo emerged as the second person cast for the film. Although it was unclear who he might play, the internet quickly seized on the possibility of Jamal Afari, Blade’s mentor in the comics who was revamped into Whistler for the first Blade film trilogy. The following February, Aaron Pierre joined the cast in an unknown role. The departure of Tariq in the Fall of 2022 not only delayed the film, but several others down the production calendar. In late September that year, Lovecraft Country‘s Yann Demange emerged as the new director with Michael Starrbury writing a new script. In April of 2023, Mia Goth joined the cast and, later that month, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto took on writing duties with production expected to begin in late May 2023. But with the onset of the Writers’ Guild strike on May 2 that year, it was unclear if Pizzolatto’s draft was completed or if production would commence without him. But as the actors eventually went on strike as well, Blade was once again delayed. As the strikes resolved late in the year, Disney pushed the film to a November 2025 release.\n\nAnd then it all fell apart again with Demange departing the production sometime earlier this year. The search is on again for a director, and according to reports, the supporting cast have been released from their contracts. Goth has clarified she will remain part of the film. Ali also still intends to star with Eric Pearson writing the latest draft. Currently, the film is still holding onto its 2025 opening, but that is increasing unlikely. Additionally, other reports indicate the film was originally meant to be a period piece but will now take place in modern-day MCU.\n\nCuriously, any mention of the film was completely absent from Marvel’s 2024 SDCC presentation (and the subsequent D23 Entertainment Showcase) with Feige only saying “three films” were set for release in 2025. We’re going to assume this means Blade is off the calendar, but we’re going to leave its current release date here until Disney offers an official word on the matter.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: While the MCU is a realm of science, mysticism, cosmic entities, and traditional street crime, it lacks for genuine monsters. Emerging from Marvel Comics’ The Tomb of Dracula, Blade will no doubt be our guide into a darker corner of the MCU where one finds things that go bump in the night. Luckily, he’s pretty good with a sword and can vanquish them with relative ease. Of course, the literal demons of the Marvel Universe may present more of a challenge. In terms of a more concrete connection to the MCU, the character made a disembodied appearance in Eternals, stopping Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington) from embracing his destiny and, seemingly, adding the character to Blade’s corner of the Marvel Universe. Additionally, the joke about there being “only one Blade” in Deadpool & Wolverine sure feels pointed about the character’s future.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday (2026)\n\nPremiere Date: May 1, 2026\n\nWhat We Know: The fifth Avengers film will presumably set up the endgame of The Multiverse Saga if that term is still in use at Marvel. On July 26, 2022, word broke indicating Destin Daniel Cretton will direct the film. That September, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania writer Jeff Loveness signed on to craft the script. During the press tour for Quantumania, he teased the film will be a “bloodbath” and inspire the next generation of Avengers. In November of 2023, both Loveness and Cretton walked away from the project with Michael Waldron taking over scripting chores. At SDCC 2024, Feige announced Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo will return to helm the film (and its follow-up), confirming earlier reports. The pair then revealed the film’s new subtitle: “Doomsday.” The film will introduce Downey’s Doctor Doom and, we assume, how he ends up controlling the Multiverse. Feige also mentioned many of the characters from the 2025 films will appear in the upcoming Avengers films. But with the project still two years away, expect news to become scarce again following Downey’s shocking return to Marvel.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Presumably, Downey’s Doom hails from an alternate Earth — maybe even the same one as the Fantastic Four — but how could such a Doom become aware of the Multiverse and the tapestry Loki (Tom Hiddleston) now maintains? Will he have to face off against the God of Stories first? Or does their shared love of the color green indicate something else?\n\nVision Quest (series)\n\nPremiere Date: 2026\n\nWhat We Know: In October of 2022, reports surfaced of a potential series staring Paul Bettany as the White Vision featured in WandaVision and his struggle to regain the memories the Hex Vision imparted to him. WandaVision and Agatha head writer Jac Schaeffer reportedly supervised a writers room that Fall, but it was unclear if the project was still moving forward, particularly with Disney and Marvel looking to slow down development of the slate and the strikes rewriting all the calendars. For a time, it seemed as though the project was one of the reported “quiet” cuts as Disney and Marvel refocused on a slower output, but in late May 2024, Star Trek: Picard‘s Terry Matalas signed on to run the show and serve as executive producer. It appears his is a new take on the concept, different from the one Schaeffer was developing. But with Disney projecting a 2026 premiere, it is currently on more solid footing than some of the other projects listed below. Adding to its stability: reports indicating James Spader will return to voice Ultron, the character he played all the way back in Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Even if Matalas is starting from scratch, the program still has one objective: restore Vision in time for the fight against Doom. Then, maybe, it will be time to deal with Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen), who we believe to be very much alive.\n\nWonder Man (series)\n\nPremiere Date: 2026?\n\nWhat We Know: Initially an untitled series tied to Cretton’s overall deal with Disney, news broke in June of 2022 that the project is, indeed, a Disney+ show centering on Wonder Man. At first a villain, the character saw the error of his ways (after dying, of course) and eventually joined the Avengers as a member in good standing. Also of note: his brain patterns were utilized to create Vision in the comics. Andrew Guest serves as head writer on the program with Cretton acting as an executive producer. He also directed episodes with Guest becoming the showrunner after a change in direction at Marvel towards a more traditional TV development model. In October of 2022, Aquaman‘s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II emerged as the star of the series with Ben Kingsley also signing on to play in-universe actor Trevor Slattery once again. Additional cast includes Mindhunters‘ Lauren Glazier, Ed Harris and Josh Gad. In February of 2023, The Photograph‘s Stella Meghie emerged as one of the program’s episode directors. That March, Demetrius Grosse joined the series as Eric Williams, Simon’s brother and eventual coma-inducing Marvel villain Grim Reaper. Production was underway when the WGA strike began and, like all other active Marvel productions, stopped filming. It resumed in November following the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Feige told The Official Marvel Podcast in June 2024 that the series is “extremely different” from the others. It is still unclear when the show will drop on Disney+, but considering the company’s plans to slow down Marvel production, this one may have to wait until 2026 at the earliest to premiere.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Wonder Man could help resolve the mystery of White Vision (Paul Bettany) and, perhaps, aid him in integrating all his memories. But as Wonder Man’s civilian identity is an actor, there may also be another chance to illustrate what movies look like in the MCU. Although, with the series positioned as “Marvel Spotlight” story, it may end up having little or no connections to the ongoing saga.\n\nAvengers: Secret Wars (2027)\n\nPremiere Date: May 7, 2027\n\nWhat We Know: The sixth Avengers film will conclude Phase 6 and, presumably, The Multiverse Saga. The title also offers a few clues as Marvel Comics has published two epic stories with that name. The first saw heroes and villains transported to Battleworld so the Beyonder could watch them fight. The second saw some heroes remembering how their world was before various incursions collapsed it and plotting against Doom, the unquestioned master of all reality, to restore the universe they loved. Also, Spider-Man Miles Morales joined the mainstream Marvel Comics Universe in the aftermath. In October 2022, Loki‘s Michael Waldron signed on to write the script, but it is unclear if his draft is the one the Russo Brothers will use. At SDCC 2024, Anthony Russo said the original Secret Wars was one of the comics that made him a reader and he hopes to bring some of its magic to the next Avengers capstone.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: No matter what Doom does in the two Avengers films, we expect the MCU will look fairly different afterward. Oh, and the post-credit scene — if one happens — would be the perfect moment to reprise the X-Men animated series theme again.\n\nArmor Wars\n\n(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, © Marvel Studios)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: According to Feige, Armor Wars will be Tony Stark’s “worst fears come to life” as bad actors get a hold of some Iron Man tech. Only Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) – a.k.a. War Machine – will be in a position to stop them. In August of 2021, Black Monday’s Yassir Lester emerged as the series’ head writer. Production was expected to start in late 2022 and as the program was not mentioned at all during the SDCC 2022 presentation, Lester took to his Instagram stories to clarify that it is still happening. Marvel and Disney subsequently announced the project would be a film instead with Lester staying on to write the script.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Cheadle, of course, has played Rhodey since Iron Man 2 and survived terrible color schemes for his armor, the crushing of his legs, being replaced by a Skrull, and the Blip. So he’s well-placed to defend Tony’s technology. Also, we can’t help but think Ironheart will show up to offer him some aid.\n\nShang-Chi 2\n\n(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: Early in December of 2021, reports suggested director Destin Daniel Cretton will return to helm a Shang-Chi sequel and develop other projects for Disney and Marvel. Presumably, Simu Liu and Awkwafina will return as Shang-Chi and Katy with Meng’er Zhang continuing to rebuild the Ten Rings as Xialing. We also imagine Wong (Bendict Wong) will appear in some capacity, as the signal Shang-Chi’s Ten Rings are sending into space will lead something to Earth. Of course, readers of the Gene Luen Yang-written Shang-Chi comic book may wonder if, perhaps, the Five Weapons Society will also be introduced. In November of 2023, Cretton departed development of the fifth Avengers film to focus on the Shang-Chi sequel, so it may materialize sooner than expected. As of the SDCC 2024 presentation, it is unclear if the sequel is still happening. One glimmer of hope: Liu attended Feige’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony the week prior to the convention.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: The signal broadcasting into space is the big one here. Will it attract a dragon-like alien race to the epicenter of the Blip? Or is it a huge diversion while the Ten Rings organization returns to prominence in the criminal underworld? And speaking of Xialing’s future as a crime boss, she will no doubt face opponents like Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) and Kingpin in her quest to be more successful than her late father.\n\nSpider-Man 4\n\n(Photo by Matt Kennedy/©Sony Pictures Releasing)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: Mere hours into Spider-Man: No Way Home’s theatrical run, Feige confirmed Marvel Studios and Sony are already developing a fourth MCU Spider-Man film. Indeed, No Way Home producer Amy Pascal indicated in early December of 2021 that a second trilogy was in the works, but Sony Pictures CEO Tom Rothman walked that back at the film’s Los Angeles premiere. And yet, the conclusion of No Way Home makes it clear Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has a part to play in the phases to come. In the meantime, of course, he still needs to clear Spider-Man’s name and get some vestige of his life back. Also, there is that piece of Venom left behind in Mexico… In February of 2023, Feige confirmed Marvel has a story in mind for a fourth film, but offered little else, and after the release of the animated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in June, Pascal gave Variety an interview in which she confirmed development on a number of Spider-Man-related titles, including a new Tom Holland film. Talks regarding the project were halted as the WGA went on strike. It is unclear if they have resumed. In April, Holland told Deadline the film will have to wait until all concerned parties have “cracked” the script.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Bear with us as we speculate wildly. The Venom symbiote may be a long-game thing, waiting in the wings until Avengers: Secret Wars – in honor of the comic book event title of the same name in which Peter first received the black spider-suit – so Spider-Man 4 could concern itself with a hero trying to re-establish his cred in a New York filled with Hawkeyes and Daredevils while also dealing with his suit’s altered abilities. Also, it is always possible he’ll find organized crime kingpin Wilson Fisk as his new opponent. One other thing to consider: as Sony is in charge of Spider-Man release dates, this project will have to fit in between the other Marvel Studios ambitions.\n\nThe X-Men\n\nWhat We Know: Just days after the WGA negotiated a new contract with the AMPTP, word broke indicating Marvel was soliciting pitches from writers for an eventual X-Men feature. Considering it is just beginning development, expect the film to occur in Phase 7 — provided Marvel still plans in phases, of course. In May of 2024, Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes writer Michael Lesslie emerged to adapt some of the boundless Mutant concepts into a Marvel Studios script. At present, no director has signed on and it is unclear just what sort of roster fans can expect … although, considering the success of X-Men ’97, the early 1990s team might be a safe guess. Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Gambit, Beast, Morph, Jubilee, and Wolverine are a pretty great ensemble and a good cross section of abilities, history, and characters.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Presuming that the film will be set after Secret Wars, it will either focus on how the X-Men avoided detection all these years or how they join into the mainstream Marvel timeline. Of course, it is always possible they will also set up the next big saga. Our wild speculation? The next overarching story will be “The Apocalypse Saga.” Loosely based on the 1990s “Age of Apocalypse” event storyline, it could see the Mutants (and other heroes) working to prevent the supremacy of Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac in 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse) in the future.\n\nRyan Coogler’s Wakanda-Set Television Series (series)\n\n(Photo by Matt Kennedy/Marvel Studios)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: As part of an overall deal with Disney, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler will develop and produce a series set in Wakanda. It is unclear if it will tell more tales of the country’s past or expand on ideas and characters seen in the film and its sequel. Beyond its setting, nothing else is known. In more recent days, Marvel announced a forthcoming Eyes of Wakanda animated series. Currently slated for a 2024 release, it is unclear if the program is built on ideas for Coogler’s live action series or if it is another addition to the Wakandan corner of the MCU.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Presuming it is set after Wakanda Forver, it may be a story about rebuilding after the events of the film.\n\nUntitled Okoye Series\n\n(Photo by Marvel Studios, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: In late May of 2021, word broke indicating Danai Gurira will lead a Disney+ spinoff detailing Okoye’s rise through the Dora Milaje ranks. This project appears to be an additional Wakanda concept beyond the others Coogler is developing.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: A focus on Okoye – and the other Dora Milaje for that matter – offers untold possibilities for story and further exploration of Wakanda. It could also strengthen her ties to characters beyond its borders. Of course, if it tells an ongoing story following the events of Wakanda Forever, it could see the character grappling with becoming more of a traditional superhero.\n\nUntitled Scarlett Johansson Production\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: During a November 2021 American Cinematheque award ceremony in Scarlett Johansson’s honor, Feige let slip that the Black Widow star will be producing a project for Marvel Studios. Characterizing it as “top secret,” the studio chief also said the production will have nothing to do with Black Widow.\n\nJohansson’s involvement with Marvel is somewhat surprising, as she sued Disney over the Disney+ premiere of Black Widow earlier that year. Although such suits are not uncommon, there seemed to be an unusual level of animosity between Disney and Johansson’s team – in the press, at least. But with the matter resolved, it seems Johansson will still take part in Marvel’s future endeavors. In late June of 2023, Johansson confirmed the project was still in development.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Since this is a “top secret” project, anything is on the table – including a film version of A-Force, the all-female Avengers team. Also, although we’re listing this as a movie project, it is also possible this will be a Disney+ series.\n\nNova\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nWhat We Know: In March of 2022, Moon Knight‘s Sabir Pirzada was reportedly developing a project based on Marvel Comics’ Nova, centering on a member of the Nova Corps, the yellow-clad space cops seen in Guardians of the Galaxy. At the time of the initial report, it was unclear if Nova would be a film or Disney+ series. In either case, it would follow a human who receives enhanced abilities upon joining the corps. Some subsequent reports indicated the project was evolving into a Marvel Special Presentation like Werewolf by Night, but with Disney and Marvel rethinking its release strategy, it is possible Nova will have to wait for quite some time.\n\nHow It Fits in the MCU: Should it become a reality, Nova could take the place of Guardians as the key window into Marvel’s intergalactic happenings.\n\nFULL LIST OF UPCOMING MARVEL MOVIES\n\nFebruary 14, 2025 – Captain America: Brave New World\n\nMay 2, 2025 – Thunderbolts*\n\nJuly 25, 2025 – The Fantastic Four: First Steps\n\nNovember 7, 2025 – Blade\n\nMay 1, 2026 – Avengers: Doomsday\n\nMay 7, 2027 – Avengers: Secret Wars\n\nOn an Apple device?
