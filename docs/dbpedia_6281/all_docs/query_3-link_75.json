        "text": "You can watch the six-part series every Friday at 9pm on BBC Two, starting from Friday 10 May. You can also catch up on any episodes you miss on BBC iPlayer.\n\nWhat's the series about?\n\nHidden Treasures of the National Trust follows the conservators, curators and other experts who breathe new life into the places and objects we care for.\n\nYou’ll go behind the scenes to see the teams' extraordinary work looking after places and their collections for future generations. Throughout the series, you’ll meet some of our dedicated staff and volunteers who’ll share their passion for the treasures they help maintain. Each episode uncovers stories from different places across England and Wales.\n\nIn series one, Hidden Treasures of the National Trust visited Smallhythe in Kent to see the conservation of the Beetle Wing dress and velvet cloak worn by Victorian actress Dame Ellen Terry in 1888. Expert conservators at Mount Stewart, County Down, fixed some unusual concrete sculptures which were damaged in a storm and conservators at Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire rebuilt the well-known Chinese-style wooden bridge. You can go back and watch all of series one on BBC iPlayer.\n\nSeries two\n\nEpisode one\n\nLearn about the quirky interiors of A la Ronde – a sixteen-sided house in Devon. Designed by cousins Jane and Mary Parminter, the house is a legacy for female creativity and is filled with mementos from their world travels in the 18th century. Experts from the house are conserving the Shell Gallery, the walls of which are covered in more than 26,000 sea shells. You'll also head to Kingston Lacy in Dorset, which William John Bankes remotely remodelled during his exile. The team are preparing a Peter Paul Rubens painting, Marchesa Maria Serra Pallavicino, to be loaned out and are conserving the obelisk in the garden.\n\nEpisode two\n\nIn the second epsiode, you'll see experts at the Royal Oak Foundation Conservation Studio in Kent conserving portraits of Nancy Astor from Cliveden, Buckinghamshire, and Mrs Greville from Polesden Lacey, Surrey. Volunteers are also cleaning the Borghese balustrade at Cliveden and conservators and other experts at Polesden Lacey are repairing the clock tower and cleaning the Fabergé objets d'art collection."
