        "text": "(It pairs very well with our habit of saying “They’re Canadian” every time someone talks about a celebrity who was born or migrated here.)\n\nSo many movies and TV shows are filmed here—especially in the production centres of Vancouver and Toronto—that we’ve earned the nickname Hollywood North. This is attributed to generous government subsidies and a good exchange rate on our dollar; many productions with budget constraints choose Canadian locations.\n\nVancouver benefits from being in the same timezone as LA, and its 60+ visual effects and animation studios make it a global VFX centre. Toronto hosts TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), which is recognized as the second most influential film festival after Cannes.\n\nCanada is home of many top actors (Ryan Gosling, Sandra Oh, Ryan Reynolds, Rachel McAdams, Keanu Reeves, to name a few) and directors (like David Cronenberg, Denis Villeneuve, James Cameron). There is no shortage of “lights, camera, action” here. No wonder we’re proud.\n\nBelow is a list of movies filmed here in Canada. It’s not exhaustive, but there is a huge variety to explore. Find one to watch tonight!\n\nMovies Filmed (Almost) Entirely in Canada\n\nRambo: First Blood\n\nIt’s been 40 years since the release of the first Rambo (1982) action movie, which is about a Vietnam war veteran who travels to visit an old friend, who unfortunately has died. The local sheriff runs him out of town and and manhunt ensues when Rambo tries to return. The story takes place in Hope, Washington, but it was filmed in the small town of Hope in southern British Columbia. The town is celebrating the anniversary, even carving a second Rambo statue to mark its legacy.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Crave, Amazon Prime, Apple TV.\n\nThe Revenant\n\nThe drama The Revenant (2015), for which Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar for Best Actor, tells the true story of a fur trapper who was left for dead after being attacked by a bear. The bear attack scene was shot north of Vancouver near Squamish and Whistler, but the rest of the movie was shot in Alberta…until there wasn’t enough snow and production had to move to the southernmost tip of South America. But other than those four days and one scene that was filmed in Montana, this movie was made in Canada.\n\nWatch on YouTube, Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon Prime.\n\nThe F Word (What If) & Scott Pilgram vs. the World\n\nThese two romantic comedies were both filmed and set in Toronto. The F Word (2013, titled What If in the USA) is about a young man and woman who meet and decide to become friends, despite having a good connection, because the woman already has a boyfriend. Other than a couple scenes in Ireland, the movie is all about Toronto.\n\nWatch on Crave, Amazon Prime, Netflix.\n\nSame with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), starring Canadian Michael Cera as the titular character. This movie is about a young man who meets the girl of his dreams but must defeat her exes before they can date, The comic book from which the film is adapted used real Toronto locations, and the film often used these same locations.\n\nWatch on YouTube, Crave, Google Play, Apple TV, Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Butterfly Effect\n\nThese two entertaining musicals were filmed in Toronto. Set in Baltimore, Toronto is a stand-in for the Maryland city in Hairspray (2007). The 1960s-era story involves a teenager who helps to integrate a popular TV show by winning a dance competition.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, Apple TV.\n\nNone of Chicago (2002) was filmed in Chicago; it was shot entirely in Toronto. This story centres on two 1920s women who have murdered their lovers and are awaiting trial. While being defended by a slick lawyer, the women compete for the public’s attention and sympathy.\n\nWatch on Crave, Google Play, Apple TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime.\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nThe latest Ghostbusters installment Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) is about a single mom who moves to a small town with her two kids and discovers her late, estranged father’s secret: he was one of the original Ghostbusters. The supernatural comedy was filmed in various locations around Alberta, and it was directed by Canadian Jason Reitman.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, Hulu.\n\nScary Movie (2000) parodies the storylines of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and other classic 1990s teen horror movies. A group of teenagers accidentally hit and kill a man with their car and bury him, then a year later are stalked and killed one-by-one by someone in a Ghostface mask. Much of the movie was filmed in the charming fishing village of Steveston, located south of Vancouver.\n\nWatch on Netflix.\n\nRoom\n\nThe drama Room (2015) is about a young woman who has been held captive in a single-room dwelling for seven years. After her escape, her son who was born in the Room (played by the young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay in his breakout role) experiences the outside world for the first time. While much of the film takes place inside the Room, which was built on a Toronto soundstage, the outdoor scenes were filmed in and around Toronto.\n\nWatch on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime.\n\nSpotlight\n\nSpotlight (2015) tells the story of the Boston Globe’s Pulitzer-winning investigation into allegations of abuse by the Catholic Church. Some of the Boston-centric story was filmed there, at locations such as the Boston Globe offices, Fenway Park, and the Boston Public Library. But most of the movie (starring Canadian Rachel McAdams as one of the journalists) was filmed in the cities of Toronto, where a former Sears building was used for the interior shots of the Boston Globe offices, and Hamilton in Ontario.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple TV, YouTube, Google Play.\n\nBilly Madison & Happy Gilmore\n\nAdam Sandler filmed in Canada a couple times early in his career. The first movie, Billy Madison (1995) is about a spoiled 27-year-old man who must, in order to inherit his father’s hotel empire, retake and pass grades 1 through 12 in just 24 weeks. It was filmed in Toronto.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV, Crave, Google Play.\n\nHis next movie, Happy Gilmore (1996) was filmed across the country in Vancouver. It’s about a failed hockey player who starts playing golf in order to win championship money and save his grandmother’s house.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV.\n\nCapote\n\nThe Deadpool movies, starring Vancouverite Ryan Reynolds, have so far been filmed in Vancouver. (The third installment will start filming in 2023, and it’s unclear right now exactly where filming will take place.) Most of the Final Destination movies were also filmed in and around Vancouver. while the X-Men movies were filmed in locations across Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec.\n\nThese two rom-coms from the early 2000s were both filmed in Canada. The Oscar-winning Juno (2007), directed by Jason Reitman and starring Michael Cera and fellow Canadian Elliot Page, is about a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant and sets out to find great adoptive parents for the baby. It was filmed in and around Vancouver, which is standing in for Elk River, Minnesota.\n\nWatch on Disney+, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV.\n\nJust Friends (2005) is about a successful record executive, played by Ryan Reynolds, who goes to his hometown with his pop star girlfriend over the winter holidays and tries to win the heart of his longtime crush, who rejected him and wanted to be “just friends” in high school. Due to budget constraints, it was filmed in winter in the cities of Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, as well as Los Angeles.\n\nWatch on Crave, Amazon Prime.\n\nMean Girls\n\nA lot of filming for these two action movies was done in Canada. The Day After Tomorrow (2004) is the highest-grossing Hollywood film made in the Great White North. It’s about a superstorm that sets off catastrophic natural disasters around the world. Largely filmed in Toronto and Montreal, other filming locations include Scotland, the USA, and Japan.\n\nWatch on Disney+, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV.\n\nJumanji (1995) is about siblings who find an old board game that unleashes jungle-based hazards on the players. It was filmed in various locations around southern British Columbia, including Burnaby, Tsawwassen, and Maple Ridge, as well as New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Google Play, Apple TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime.\n\nInterstellar\n\nDespite being set in Boston, these two movies were actually filmed in Canada. Good Will Hunting (1997) centres around Will Hunting, a custodian at MIT, whose genius-level intelligence is discovered by a professor. After being arrested for assaulting a police officer, Hunting gets treatment with a therapist in order to receive a more lenient sentence. Due to financial concerns, the drama was filmed in Toronto along with some real Boston locations.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play.\n\nThe opening scene of Boondock Saints (1999) was filmed in Boston, along with a couple other scenes, though this movie was also mostly filmed in Toronto. In this thriller, two devout Irish Catholic brothers act as vigilantes as they hunt and kill gangsters in their hometown.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Amazon Prime.\n\nSuicide Squad\n\nThese two superhero movies were filmed in Canada. In Kick-Ass (2010), a lonely high school student and comic book fan decides to become a superhero, despite having neither training nor powers. Mostly filmed in Hamilton and Toronto, some filming was also done in the UK.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Google Play, Apple TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime.\n\nAfter exposure to gamma radiation, a scientist in The Incredible Hulk (2008) transforms into the titular character whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. He goes on the run from the US government after killing several people in his lab due to this condition, and he searches for a cure. Filmed in Toronto and Hamilton in Ontario and Bella Coola in British Columbia, parts of this movie were also filmed in Brazil.\n\nWatch on Crave, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV, Hulu.\n\nCool Runnings\n\nBoth of these dramas were adapted from novels by Montrealer Mordecai Richler. In Barney’s Version (2010), the character of Barney tells the story of his life, including the mysterious death of a friend and his three marriages. It was filmed in Montreal and other locations in Quebec, New York, and Italy.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV, Crave, Google Play.\n\nThe Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974) centres around the titular character, a young Jewish man from Montreal who is obsessed with acquiring status, money, and lakefront property—and is willing to do what he needs to in order to do so. This movie was filmed and set in Quebec.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, Apple TV.\n\nextra: A little bit of Leo in Canada\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is my favourite actor, and lucky for me he has filmed in Canada nearly from coast to coast. In addition to the months he spent in the west filming The Revenant—during which I told my coworkers and friends to call me at any time, day or night, if they spotted Leo around Vancouver—he has also spent some time filming in Quebec.\n\nTitanic\n\nTitanic (1997) is one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, and it was partly filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the east coast of Canada. It tells the heart-wrenching story of the sinking of the ship, with some star-crossed romance added to make it even sadder. The modern-day scenes of the movie (okay, so Leo wasn’t actually there) were filmed in Halifax, a city near where the real Titanic sank, though the big story from there was the large-scale poisoning of cast and crew members on set.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, Google Play.\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\nIn Catch Me If You Can (2002), Leo, as Frank Abagnale Jr., travels around the world committing forgery, fraud, and other crimes. For the scenes that take place in France, the drama was filmed in Montreal instead.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV.\n\nThe Aviator\n\nIn the historical biopic The Aviator (2004), Leo plays legendary director and aviator Howard Hughes, spanning his career from the late 1920s to the mid 1940s as he gains professional success and suffers from paralyzing phobias and depression. Though a lot of the movie was set and filmed in Los Angeles, some iconic landmarks were recreated and filmed in Montreal.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Apple TV, Crave, Google Play.\n\nInception\n\nThis mind-bending thriller is about the act of stealing and implanting corporate secrets through dream-sharing technology. Inception (2010) was filmed all over the world: California, France, United Kingdom, Morocco, Japan, and finally Canada. The winter scenes were filmed at the same closed-down ski resort outside of Calgary as The Revenant. Fun fact: the avalanches filmed there in both movies were real, not CGI.\n\nWatch on Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon Prime.\n\nDid any film on this list surprise you?
