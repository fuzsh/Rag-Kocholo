        "text": "I thought Trinity was the weakest of the Blade films.\n\nLikes:\n\n-If Whistler went out, at least he went out like a man and fitting for his character.\n\n-Blade v. FBI. I wish there had been more of it.\n\n-Hannibal King. I didn't think he was all that bad, though he could've been toned down a bit. However, Ryan Reynolds had nice comic timing.\n\n-Drake. Dominic Purcell wasn't a bad choice though I probably would've picked someone else-Djimon Hounsou or the Arab actor from Lost-I can't recall his name at the moment. Goyer's take on the Dracula legend wasn't bad, I liked the Dagon tie. I also liked the demon-reaper form.\n\n-Blade. Though he phoned in a lot of his performance, Wesley still brought it, and it was good to see him one last time.\n\nDislikes:\n\n-Abby and King horning in on Blade's screentime. King was all right, but there was nothing particularly cool or interesting about him and Abby as a team.\n\n-Abigail Whistler. At least King had comic relief, and if used right they could've played his opposing style against Blade's, something like 48 Hours. Abby was a cipher, and the attempts to make her cool were unrealistic even for a vampire movie. And why wasn't there a scene between Whistler and his daughter? I really think Biel was in the picture solely to take that unnecessary shower scene.\n\n-Danica Talos. Will someone stop putting Parker Posey in comic book movies! She's the kiss of death. Her Danica was totally lame and her crew was weak. Grimwood had potential, but the rest...\n\n-Nightstalkers. Come on, Patton Oswalt and Natasha Lyons, and a black guy who procures (i.e. steals) cars? That's it. I would've liked a more harder edged group.\n\n-The bad guys didn't really have a master plan. Outside of framing Blade and resurrecting Drake, then what? What was Drake supposed to do exactly when he woke up? Daystar seemed like something of an add on when it could've been a storyline driving the whole movie.\n\n-Drake. You give a guy shapeshifting powers and then you have him fight a guy called Blade with a sword? Of course I'm sure Drake wanted to test himself against a worthy opponent, but it would've been nice to change up the big finale fight a little. Drake's character was also woefully underdeveloped and not given enough badass moments like Frost and Nomak were before the big fight. Plus, they shouldn't have had Drake hiding behind babies or running from Blade.\n\n-Drake shapeshifting into Whistler to invade the Nightstalker camp. For one, where did he learn who Whistler was or what he looked like? And two, why didn't whoever gave him the information tell him that Whistler was dead? I think it would've made more since for him to imitate Blade, King, or Abby since the audience saw him engage them before he snuck into their base.\n\n-The fights. Largely more of the same. Though the movie cost more than the other two I believed, it looked like it cost less.\n\nOkay here we go. I'll do something similar to what Darkush did.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The opening where Drake was brought back to life.\n\n2. Blade's opening scene with the car chase, taking down vamps\n\n3. The Daystar idea (they could have expanded on it though)\n\n4. Blade's last conversations with Whistler\n\n5. Blade and Abigail discovering the \"blood-farms\"\n\n6. the dog mutations. It showed that the vampires were experimenting, trying new things.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. Too much focus on Nightstalkers.\n\n2. Whister died too quickly. He should've stayed still the end or died helping Blade take out Drake. Whister deserved better.\n\n3. Too much comedy from Hannibal King. I liked his character though, but this is not the movie to put a lot of jokes in.\n\n4. Drake:\n\n-(the actor did a good job but....)\n\n-his powers were lame (shape shifting?)\n\n-I felt he could have been more intimidating\n\n-He died too easily\n\n-When he finally met Blade face to face, he says \"come on Blade, show me what you're made of\" and he jumps out of a window and runs away from him!\n\n5. We needed no narrator at the beginning of the film. There wasnt one in the previous two. We didnt need one now.\n\n6. I didn't like how the FBI got involved with tracking Blade.\n\n7. How did Hannibal and Abigail find out where Blade was being held by the FBI?\n\n8. Why did Drake kill all the Nightstalkers except Hannibal?\n\n9. Where are all the new cool weapons at?\n\n10. Fight scenes could've been better.\n\n11. Too much happened in the day light. It needed to be more darker, like the previous two.\n\n12. Parker Posey was terrible. So was Triple H.\n\n13. Blade:\n\n-Wesley Snipes didnt look like he was really into the Blade character this time around.\n\n14. The Plot. Sure it had the Daystar idea, (which I liked) but that was about it. Bringing back Dracula didn't mean very much.\n\n15. The vampires seemed weak\n\n16. There needed to be a better climax for the ending of this series.\n\nTrinity was great but a notch below the lofty standards set by 1&2. My biggest complaint was a dropped storyline. There was talk of this movie being set in the future where Blade & the Nightstalkers were the leaders of an underground resistance group after the vampires had overrun the world. I thnk that would have been outstanding.\n\nOther criticisms:\n\n1) No explanation on how HK & Abby can go toe to toe w/ Vamps. In the first two films, humans were easily overpowered by bloodsuckers.\n\n2) Abby's \"cure\" for HK. Was it like the stasis detox for Whistler in pt.2? If there wasn't a special set of circumstances, why wouldn't the Nighstalkers just go around shooting vamps with vials of the \"cure\"? That seems alot easier.\n\n3) No continuity with the Vampire upper eschalon. Who exactly were the vamps that found Drake? We know ther names but what governing body/vamp house were they from?\n\n4) Drake's look. His vampiric form was awesome but his human look was all wrong. If he was a warrior from ancient Sumeria, why didn't he have long hair, tattoos or scarification, necklaces of his enemies teeth etc...?\n\nThe Good:\n\n1) The idea of expanding the group fighting the vamps. In pt 1, Whistler says, \"Blade, myself and a few others try to keep (the war ) from spilling over into the street\". We didn't see any of their allies in part 2. It was logical for them to appear in pt. 3.\n\n2) Blade's serum inhaler. It wasn't as cool as watching Blade shake from the injections but it was more pragmatic for controlling the thirst during days of battles. It's been curiously absent from the TV series.\n\n3) The vamps working with/ controlling the FBI. Whistler also said, \"They own the police\" in pt .1. Again, a nice logical progression.\n\n4) Blade vs. Dracula. It had to happen if pt .3 was indeed the last in the movie franchise's run.\n\n5) The human storehouse. I'm glad Goyer found a way to inject that back into the storyline after it was cut from the original.\n\n6) Jarko Grimwood. HHH was much better than I expected. I would have liked to have seen an extended fight scene with Blade & JK but I really liked how King punched his ticket.\n\n7) Daystar virus. Biological warfare-perfect idea for fighting the vampire virus.\n\n..And to answer your question about the red shirt, I think Snipes was a little heavier in the begining of the movie and trimmed up as it went on.\n\nSavage said:\n\nI loved it but it's definately the weakest of the series. I'd watch any movie for Snipes' fights alone\n\nA lot of it, apparently, was his double Clay Fontanot. It's no secret Snipes hated the direction the third film was going in, and a lot of days, he just didn't want to do anything. There's even a scene from the alternate ending where Blade is supposed to open his eyes after being presumed dead, and they had to CGI the opening of his eyes 'cause Snipes wouldn't do it on set. Yeah, Snipes should have soldiered on for the sake of the film, but Goyer and New Line were clearly sidelining Blade in favor of the Nightstalkers.\n\nand Hannibal King was pretty badass. Abigail was just...there...and...awkward. Stunt double was desperately needed. Too many actors and actresses want to do their own stunts at the cost of quality.\n\nI applaud the effort. Reynolds (ESPECIALLY Reynolds) and Biel got in ridiculous shape to come off believable as vampire hunters, and them wanting to do as much as they could is far more encouraging than seeing simple actions done by stunt people.\n\nAs for The film, I pretty much agree with everything most of you have already said. The big things for me of course are the lack of a vampire hierarchy, which has always been a strong fixture in the franchise (and one of the things I love about the television series), the specifics of the Nightstalkers, as the idea of them makes sense based not only on the comics but dialogue from Whistler in the first film. Somerfield, she should have been Karen Jensen. I would have hated to see her die, but one, the re-introduction of her character would have meant more focus on Blade, and two, it fits in with Hannibal being cured. Mind you, I think it would have been interesting to see how Blade handled a full-fledged vampire on his team. It wouldn't be the same as Blade 2 since everyone else would still be human, and they'd be calling the shots. And I definitely agree with the idea that Dracula should have looked a lot different. I would have cast an actor maybe of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean descent. Long hair, a beard, that would have been nice. A full back tattoo of his glyph as opposed to the tiny brand in the center of his chest.\n\nThe sad thing is, Trinity was the most expensive of the Blade films, and looked cheaper than Blade 2!!! What's abundantly clear is that Goyer had no business directing the film. The other two films benefitted more from their directors, with Norrington have a visual effects background, and Del Toro being a master of horror and a full-fledged comic book geek. Blade 2 is probably my favorite comic book movie, as opposed to something like X-Men or Batman Begins that are films based on comics, the difference being how they present the story and characters. Blade 2 had a stronger translation of elements in comic book storytelling. The dialogue, the pacing, the action, all more reminiscent of what you'd see in a comic book. The scene wher Nomak uppercuts Blade during their fight at the end, It's like looking at a comic panel, and you can almost see the sound effect lettering. X-men and Batman Begins had standard movie action, but nothing to really remind you of the action you might find in any particular comic. Burton's Batman falls more into that category."
