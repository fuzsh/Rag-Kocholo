        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nNow back for the fifth season, Virgin River was filmed in and around Vancouver in British Columbia. The story follows nurse practitioner Melinda Munroe who decides to make a fresh start after becoming a widow.\n\nMelinda moves to the remote (and fictional) Californian town of Virgin River, located in the redwood forests of Humboldt County, where the series is set. Melinda meets an intriguing man, Jack Sheridan, who is a former Marine, and owner of Jack’s Bar.\n\nCreated by Sue Tenney, the show stars Alexandra Breckenridge (This Is Us, American Horror Story) as Melinda, while Martin Henderson (Grey’s Anatomy) plays Jack.\n\nNetflix's Virgin River is an adaptation based on Robyn Carr's bestselling 20-book series of the same name.\n\nWelcome to the best and most complete guide to all the filming locations of Virgin River. You'll find the locations in order of appearance, with the new season 5 updates below in the report.\n\nWelcome to Virgin River, California\n\nIn the first season, some exteriors of the fictional village were recorded in Bowen Island.\n\nThe film crew took footage of the streets and buildings in the charming harbor town of Snug Cove, as reported by the local news source Bowen Island Undercurrent.\n\nNote the American flag waving in front of the Canadian town public library. The neighborhood around Artisan Lane is full of cute and colorful houses.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix and Google Maps\n\nThe Virgin River House\n\nOur sleuthing revealed that the magnificent Vernon Mullins' Family Practice Clinic house is located at 122 First Street in New Westminster.\n\nThis Victorian home, built in 1889, is situated in the historic Queen’s Park neighborhood. According to this property's listing service, the house is nicknamed Breezehurst.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nThe mansion is a spectacular Queen Anne-style home featuring more than 6,000 square feet of living space over four floors, a lovely wrap-around veranda, mature gardens, and the beautiful stained glass windows that we can appreciate in the series.\n\nHowever, Doc's house interiors are a set built at the studios.\n\nMel's cabin is the caretaker’s house in Murdo Frazer Park on Vancouver's North Shore, near the Pitch and Putt Public golf course.\n\nSince it was built in 1950, the cabin has often appeared in movies and TV shows including The Flash, The Magicians, Once Upon a Time, or Siren.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Map\n\nAfter fixing it, the log cabin looks this good. The area where the house is located in North Vancouver is fairly dense residential, with lots of developments around.\n\nHowever, it seems rural because the house is on a park with five acres of land with wooded trails and a small pond.\n\nThe exteriors of Jack's bar were filmed at The Watershed Grill near the Eagle Run Viewing Shelter in Brackendale (Squamish).\n\nThis is a fantastic place with awesome views over the Brackendale Eagles Provincial Park and its surrounding mountains.

Fabulous beautiful views! Enjoying it so much here in old New England! Wish there really was a place like Jack's though we do have a few similar pubs and some with a pool! Always great eating places to hang out during storms! Thanks for sharing wonderful photos. Glad to hear another season is coming... bring it on!\n\n4- Anonymous - February 8, 2020 at 12:12 PM\n\nI think it's great but how do they ever think it passed as northern California!\n\n5- Fabiola - January 12, 2021 at 7:54 PM\n\nBrenda, Jack's Bar is a real place! The exteriors of Jack's bar were filmed at The Watershed Grill near the Eagle Run Viewing Shelter in Brackendale (Squamish), in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n6- Anonymous - December 9, 2019 at 3:28 PM\n\nJust started watching the show and I love it ... reminds me of BC so much... too bad it's a fictional location.\n\n7- Frank - December 9, 2019 at 8:39 PM\n\nWe have been enjoying this series. The scenery matches Dunsmuir/Mt Shasta somewhat, so it's a good fake of North California.\n\n8- Anonymous - January 5, 2020 at 3:33 PM\n\nI was thinking the same thing. I live in Cali and swore I recognized fort Bragg too, guess I was wrong.\n\n9- Anonymous - December 9, 2020 at 5:24 PM\n\nI agree. I'm familiar with that area. My brother lives near Eureka ca.\n\n10- Ian - December 9, 2019 at 9:20 PM\n\nAWESOME\n\n11- Anonymous - December 10, 2019 at 1:02 AM\n\nThe lakes that Jack and Mel visit - around the 35-minute mark in episode 1 and the 20-minute mark in episode 3 - where are they?\n\n12- John - December 10, 2019 at 11:51 AM\n\nThe first episode - looks like the Squamish river (near where the Watershed Grill which fronts Jacks Bar is). The waterfall featured in a couple of scenes is nearby Shannon Falls in Squamish.\n\n13- Cristy's - December 10, 2019 at 4:23 PM\n\nIt's funny Doc's clinic (in the last picture) is across the street from the bar :)\n\n14- Capturing You - December 12, 2019 at 7:58 AM\n\nThere is a shot of the town with the town sign in front and that is taken in Agassiz, BC.\n\nReply\n\n15- Ra Moon - December 12, 2019 at 4:03 PM\n\nThanks, updated!\n\n16- Fabiola - January 12, 2021 at 7:55 PM\n\nWhere in Agassiz, BC, exactly.

Not only is the story supposed to be set in Northern CA but it also mentions Eureka and Miner’s Flat, perhaps like Myer’s Flat.\n\n23- Nikkis Mom - January 10, 2020 at 12:11 PM\n\nIt also mentions Fortuna. I lived there for 14 years.\n\n24- Big Charlie - November 28, 2020 at 10:54 AM\n\nThese locales are a joke, this is nothing like the Humboldt I know and to say it's around Eureka/Fortuna is even more of a joke. I live in Seattle and spend a lot of time in Eureka/Arcata where I have another home. The scenery looks just like what it is, BC. So many much real scenery in Humboldt it's a shame they didn't film there. Rea.\n\nReply\n\n25- JS - May 4, 2021 at 9:38 PM\n\nIt’s called “suspended disbelief”.

I also think the scenes in Episode 3 where Jack and Mel go with the baby to a picnic area on the Pitt River in Coquitlam near Minekhada Park. Loved watching this series and identifying so many beautiful scenes near where I live.\n\n28- Joanna - November 8, 2020 at 6:57 PM\n\nLoving the series!\n\n29- Anonymous - November 28, 2020 at 8:00 AM\n\nI felt at ease, with a warm comfort watching season 1. The scenery is spectacular. Recently I was delighted to come across a second season. I got curious as to the filming location, it's just so beautiful and comfortable. Lol, I used to live in this area several years ago. I love the scenery shots even more.\n\n30- Jo Ellen - November 29, 2020 at 1:45 PM\n\nWhy is there a 48-star American flag in Jack's Bar?\n\n31- Lucía, de la Patagonia Argentina - November 30, 2020 at 7:40 AM\n\nMe encantó la serie, el paisaje maravilloso!!!

Looks so familiar! It's such a beautiful spot!\n\n34- Janet - December 8, 2020 at 7:16 PM\n\nConnie's store is at 4368 Marine Drive in West Vancouver. It is an old gas station and convenience store... And I think the restaurant from episode 7 is the West Vancouver Yacht Club Clubhouse.\n\nReply\n\n35- Ra Moon - December 8, 2020 at 12:24 PM\n\nAwesome, thanks a lot!\n\n36- Anonymous - December 9, 2020 at 2:10 PM\n\nIs the lake where Jack was fishing and his marine buddies camping called Sasamat Lake, White Pine Beach?\n\n37- Mark Monroe - December 18, 2020 at 1:42 PM\n\nAre there any pictures of the layout inside Mel's cabin?\n\n38- Anonymous - December 21, 2020 at 11:14 PM\n\nI lived near the log cabin and the man-made lake behind when I was a kid aged 8 to 12 in the 1960s. We played around there a lot as it was/is a beautiful place. The lake was stocked with trout and the caretaker let us throw feed to them. The area has lots of houses around and is very close to fairly dense residential. I guess it is on maybe five acres tho, so seems rural. I am happy to see it in this show as well as the other locations that I know quite well (Squamish area).\n\n39- Anonymous - December 27, 2020 at 8:47 PM\n\nWhat lake were Mel and her husband sailing on in Season 2?\n\n40- Tom - December 31, 2020 at 5:32 PM\n\nI'm just wondering if Joey's house is the same house from Girlfriends Guide to Divorce.\n\n41- Mary - February 6, 2021 at 9:34 AM\n\nIn episode 1, season 2 the picnic area is the Cleveland Dam in NV.\n\n42- Lora - March 17, 2021 at 9:39 AM\n\nI really liked the series although being from Humboldt County, I didn't see the purpose to make the Story somewhere without Showing the Authentic Beauty of Humboldt County. Filmed in British Columbia, it would have been less distracting and more engaging to see it as BC. Especially when all those who know Humboldt are disappointed the area wasn't considered. Fictional towns in BC would suffice. Just sayin' And yes, most don't care, until your town is in a series and it's Not!\n\n43- Roll Cage Mary - June 1, 2021 at 3:19 AM\n\nIn episode 1 of season 2, the cathedral-ceiling cafe Mel and Doc have lunch at is the Lynn Canyon Cafe, not the Ecology center, which is a totally different building.\n\n44- Alex - July 11, 2021 at 1:01 AM\n\nHello, Alex from the Netherlands here. I like this overview of locations. Season 3 was launched last Friday, July 10th. Isn't there someone who can create a Google Maps and share it here, to see where all the locations are?

In \"New Beginnings\" Mel is running across Lynn Valley Suspension Bridge in North Vancouver, which is even more spectacular and free to visit. But it's still closed.\n\n47- Mary - July 24, 2021 at 7:13 PM\n\nWhere is the restaurant Jack and Tony meet in season 3, episode 5?\n\n48- Anonymous - July 25, 2021 at 11:53 AM\n\nWhy is this an American production when it's almost completely filmed in Canada and almost all the actors are either Canadian or New Zealand?\n\n49- I love Virgin River - Nov 3, 2021, 3:47 AM\n\nOmg, I love this show so much! The writing is so good I'm glued to the tv watching every episode back to back! Please make more soon!! The entire town or towns where filmed are absolutely beautiful. I'd love to live in a place that beautiful with such amazing ppl! I wish there was a real Virgin River... minus Calvin and his thugs of course, lol\n\nCan't wait for season 4! They always leave you wanting more. Wondering what's going to happen next, love it!!! Love all the cast too, they're just so amazing together it really makes the show great.\n\n50- Bucurukveben - Jan 14, 2022, 9:48 AM\n\nAll I want is a house like Mel's cabin in Virgin River.\n\n51- Jojoh - Feb 13, 2022, 7:43 AM\n\nI watched seasons 1, 2, and 3. I hope there is a season 4! Season 3 really leaves you hanging. What if there is not a season 4, that is no way to end a show! I love it so much that I want to go there for a week. Is there a real Bed and Breakfast to stay at?\n\n52- Alice - Jun 26, 2022, 9:02 PM\n\nDoes anyone know where the Moonlight Mingle was filmed?

I had a feeling some of the locations were familiar to me as I was lucky enough to visit Vancouver 14 years ago. Loving the series and of course, the beautiful locations. Thank you!\n\n55- Lilly - Jul 22, 2022, 6:29 PM\n\nWhat brand is that upholstered king-size bed in the last episode of season four? The bed where Jack and Mel are in after their engagement.\n\n56- John Australia - Jul 27, 2022, 10:55 PM\n\nJust finished series 4, I can’t wait for series 5, brilliant!\n\n57- Anonymous - Jul 29, 2022, 5:31 AM\n\nHello, I would like to know where is the bar where Nate and Jack take a glass in episode 408.\n\n58- Betty - Jul 31, 2022, 4:20 AM\n\nRoll on series 5!\n\n59- Anonymous - Jul 31, 2022, 8:53 PM\n\nThe reason it is filmed in BC Canada, the greater Vancouver area, close to the Washington USA border, and not in northern Cali is because there are big film grants and tax breaks for filming here. And there are existing studios and a large population of film crew here.\n\nWe are known as Hollywood north. And at any time, you can walk down the street and either see a celeb or run into the filming of some sort. Last week I ran into four different productions going on within 25 miles. It is very affordable to film here in the greater Vancouver area, the temperature is always mild and tons of film crews are here to hire.\n\nSadly though, often our local actors are not up to LA par, but generally, main stars in larger productions are brought up from LA or New York, thankfully. You can tell the difference. As with Jack here. Far superior acting ability and experience to all other actors in this production. Not a dis, just the facts of our filming system here. Our studios are second to none as well.\n\n60- Anonymous - Aug 13, 2022, 6:35 AM\n\nI just love everything about Virgin River - I’ve watched all series four times, it’s my happy place.\n\n61- Mike - Aug 24, 2022, 12:38 AM\n\nThe old cabin on the pond that Mel stays in the first night (I've just started watching today), is the same cabin Anne Heche's character lived in, in Men in Trees.\n\n62- Anonymous - Oct 4, 2022, 8:25 PM\n\nWhere is the town they show in many of the opening scenes?

I usually jog or for short walks and I get mesmerized by the houses in the area. I will see if can kindly ask to go inside (perhaps to a real estate agent), I saw the pictures of the house inside and it looks like a house from England from the 1800s, well indeed the house was built in 1800. I would have never imagined it was in New Westminster where I live, literally I just have to cross the boulevard. Queens Park historic district is a must!\n\n66- Anonymous - Sep 9, 2023, 8:49 PM\n\nSecond episode of season five. I highly doubt they hiked the Chief Trail. There is a viewpoint just like that at the Sea to Sky Gondola, just a few meters from the suspension bridge in the first episode of S5.\n\nReply\n\n67- Ra Moon - Sep 10, 2023, 12:04 PM\n\nThank you, I think that now we found the exact location!\n\n68- Resident - Sep 17, 2023, 11:13 AM\n\nHalfway through season 3 the Humboldt County communities mentioned so far are from south to north... Shelter Cove, Garberville, Myers Flat, Fortuna, Dinsmore, Eureka, Arcata, and McKinleyville. As a resident of Humboldt and Del Note counties from 1970 to 1995, it is so cool that all these towns are mentioned in the Virgin River TV series!\n\n69- Anonymous - Sep 30, 2023, 7:45 AM\n\nWhere is the camping trip in episode four filmed?\n\n70- Anonymous - Nov 3, 2023, 7:04 PM\n\nThe outside shot of the hospital emergency looks very much like Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, NC.
