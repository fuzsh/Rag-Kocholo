        "text": "Canada’s British Columbia is quite simply heaven for skiers of all abilities. It offers a vast 14,000 hectares of varied terrain, from some of the steepest drops in the world to uncrowded gentle slopes and beautiful forest runs.\n\nYou’re probably familiar with Whistler, which is North America’s top ski destination, but British Columbia actually has 13 unique winter resorts. The area is especially appealing to skiers and boarders who like their runs more raw, less manicured and more authentic than found elsewhere.\n\nSpread over 10 mountains, the scenery from all of BC’s resorts ranges from nothing short of majestic to jaw-droppingly beautiful. In the depths of winter, its acres of conifer trees are transformed into ‘snow ghosts’, creating a Narnia-like landscape.\n\nIts mountains benefit from deep snowfalls, with an average of 12 to 18 metres every season, much of it dry, champagne powder – the Holy Grail for skiers and boarders – and the winter season stretches from late November well into April.\n\nOn the slopes you’ll find chutes, half-pipes and exhilarating forest runs, but this winter playground also offers plenty of other activities such as snowmobiling, dog-sledding and snowshoeing trails, plus zip lining and ice cave tours, making it the perfect choice for multi-generation families or mixed groups of skiers and non-skiers.\n\nWhat’s more, much of the accommodation in British Columbia’s resorts is conveniently close to the slopes, with lots of ski-in/ski-out options. In Big White, even the main street is a designated ski run! You’ll also find plenty of atmospheric lodges, cute cabins and charming hotels to tempt your guests.\n\nIt might seem like a long way to go for snow, British Columbia’s ski resorts are easily accessible from major airports, with Whistler and Mount Washington being the closest to Vancouver Airport, while those further east can be reached via Calgary or regional airports.\n\nA paradise for thrill-seekers\n\nThe resorts of Revelstoke, Whistler and Kicking Horse have three of the longest vertical drops in North America, with Revelstoke – the longest – boasting a drop of 5,620 feet.\n\nDubbed the Champagne Powder Capital of Canada, Kicking Horse alone has 85 chutes and four bowls, so lots to challenge the serious skier.\n\nBritish Columbia gave birth to the concept of heli-skiing and it offers numerous heli- and cat-skiing operators to take serious skiers to remote locations where they can find virgin slopes to shred some powder.\n\nThere is also plenty of easily accessible off-piste skiing from many of its resorts, or guests looking for a bigger adventure can hire a guide for a backcountry tour.\n\nPerfect for families\n\nMany of British Columbia resorts are family friendly. SilverStar is a good option because of its choice of easy green and cruisy blue runs and also its more challenging double-black diamonds and mogul fields. Mostly ski in/ski out Sun Peaks is also worth considering for its nursery slopes and wide blues.\n\nLively après ski\n\nThe nighttime vibe in British Columbia ski resorts is laid back, with buzzing village pubs, unique breweries and distilleries providing plenty of dining and drinking options for visitors.\n\nExperience the unique Powder Highway\n\nIf your clients can’t choose between BC’s 13 resorts, why not suggest they combine a couple along the famed Powder Highway, a circular route through the Kootenay Rockies linking eight resorts: Red Mountain, a hidden gem which is often considered one of Canada’s most underrated resorts; family-friendly Whitewater; the soaring peaks of Revelstoke and Kicking Horse; the winding slopes of Panorama; sunny Kimberley; and Fernie, one of the snowiest places in Canada."
