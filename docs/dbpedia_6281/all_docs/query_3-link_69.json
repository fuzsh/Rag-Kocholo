        "text": "In both visual and written form, fans of Bridgerton have been transported to Mayfair, London in early 1800s, introduced to a glamorous world of sophisticated balls, powerful families, calculated courtships, and of course, sensational scandal. The Netflix show, which debuted on December 25, 2020, is based on the eight-book series by author Julia Quinn. While the storylines of the period drama mirror those of the romance novels pretty closely, there are still some differences.\n\nNew characters are introduced, such as the gossip-loving Queen Charlotte and modiste Genevieve Delacroix, and a few subplots are reimagined. But Quinn approves: “I feel the need to assure all my readers and just say, look, this isn't a word for word adaptation, but it shouldn't be, and I don't want it to be,” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2020. “A word for word adaptation of my books would not make a great TV series. But an adaptation where you've got my characters and my stories, but give it new life is amazing. It's again, I mean, I have no words and I write words for a living, and it's just — I'm so excited by it.”\n\nSo dearest readers, to learn all of the differences between the Bridgerton books and the Netflix series, scroll on.\n\n*Major spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 of Bridgerton below!*\n\nDaphne’s introduction into Regency London’s high society\n\nIn season one of Bridgerton, Daphne is described as “flawless” and “a diamond of the first water” after her debut before Queen Charlotte. But in Quinn’s novel, Daphne isn’t exactly as desired in the Ton. In fact, in The Duke & I, the eldest Bridgerton daughter is entering her second social season, as most of the eligible men in town think of her more as a friend than a potential spouse.\n\nDaphne and Simon’s first meeting\n\nThe two meet at a ball in both the Netflix series and the book, but the encounter unfolds a bit differently. In episode one of Bridgerton, Daphne unintentionally runs into Simon in an attempt to evade Lord Nigel Berbrooke. In The Duke & I, Simon is hiding from the debutantes’ advances and ends up eavesdropping on Daphne and Lord Berbrooke’s conversation. After Daphne punches Lord Berbrooke for his forcefulness, Simon intervenes and simply can’t turn his attention away from Daphne.\n\nThe Duke of Hastings doesn’t box\n\nSimon’s boxing with his friend Will Mondrich is a prevalent subplot throughout the first season of Bridgerton. But his involvement with the sport is nonexistent in the book series.\n\nAnthony knew about Daphne and Simon’s scheme\n\nIn the Netflix series, Anthony, the firstborn Bridgerton, is extremely protective of Daphne and is intent on preserving the family’s reputation. However, he is not nearly as overbearing in the books. While Daphne and Simon vow to keep their pretend courtship a secret in the show, they decide to tell Anthony of their scheme in the book. Anthony agrees to the situation under three conditions: it remains a secret, Simon and Daphne are never alone together, and Simon absolutely does not even think about stealing Daphne’s honor.\n\nLord Featherington’s relationship with Lady Featherington\n\nLord Featherington gambles away his family’s fortune and leaves them penniless after his death in the season one finale. But the Featherington patriarch is rarely mentioned in the book series. In fact, he has already been dead for three years in The Duke & I.\n\nSimon’s stutter doesn’t totally disappear\n\nSimon has not totally overcome his stutter in the book series, and it’s not Lady Danbury who helps him. Rather, a woman named Nurse Hopkins assists him as a child.\n\nDaphne and Simon’s controversial bedroom scene\n\nIn episode six, Daphne realizes that Simon has been using the withdrawal method during sex to purposely avoid getting her pregnant. She feels betrayed and deceived by her new husband, so the next time they make love, she positions herself in a way where he’s unable to pull out, despite his protests. The scene sparked debate among viewers. Both participants consented to sex in the beginning, but Daphne very obviously took advantage of the Duke’s vulnerable state and forced him to do the one thing he was adamant about not doing.\n\nIn the book, Simon returns home drunk and falls asleep. Daphne rouses him and takes advantage of his intoxicated state, knowing full well that he won’t be able to withdraw before climaxing. Simon never consented. Regé-Jean Page, who played the Duke of Hastings in the Netflix series, told OprahMag.com, “I was very happy that we had a different scene in the TV show than in the book.”\n\nQuinn’s book series doesn’t address race\n\nNetflix’s Bridgerton places Black citizens into positions of high ranking and power, and the Sharma family in season two are from India. In Quinn’s book series, all of the characters are presumably white.\n\nMany historians believe that Queen Charlotte, who is portrayed by actress Golda Rosheuvel, was England’s first mixed-race royal. “It's so empowering for an actress to have that background and that feeling that a person in the 1800s could have been fighting for her people and could have been fighting for representation,” the actress told Insider in 2020.\n\nThere are a number of new characters introduced in the Netflix series\n\nSiena Rosso (Anthony’s mistress), Queen Charlotte, Prince Friederich, dressmaker Genevieve Delacroix, artist Henry Granville, and Lord Featherington are all practically nonexistent characters in Quinn’s series.\n\nMarina Thompson isn’t a major character in Quinn’s The Duke & I\n\nMarina arrives in Mayfair, London as a cousin to the Featheringtons and is pregnant by a man named George Crane, who died in battle. But Marina is merely a character mentioned in passing in the fifth Bridgerton book, To Sir Phillip, With Love, as the deceased wife of Sir Phillip Crane (who Marina eventually marries in the Netflix series). She’s also a cousin of the Bridgertons, not the Featheringtons. So Colin Bridgerton’s visit to Marina in the second season is a subplot created just for the show, as well.\n\nThe revelation of Lady Whistledown’s identity\n\nLady Whistledown is revealed to be Penelope Featherington in the season one finale, a truth that is not uncovered until the fourth installation of Quinn’s books series, Romancing Mister Bridgerton.\n\nIn an interview with Decider, showrunner Chris Van Dusen explained why the gossip’s identity was revealed so early: “For me, it felt like it was time,” he shared. “I think that there were always two tracks for us in the writers’ room when looking at Lady Whistledown. We knew that there was a portion of the audience that had read the books and had their thoughts and theories about who Lady Whistledown was. Then, there was an entirely new group of people that are not as familiar with the books, and have no idea where the story of Lady Whistledown went. It was about keeping the mystery alive and fun for fans of the books, but also, never being ahead of it. Never telegraphing where we’re going.”\n\nIn the second season of Bridgerton, we see a lot of behind-the-scenes shots of Lady Whistledown, a.k.a Penelope, gathering her gossip, writing away, and dashing to the printer. But again, her identity isn’t revealed until book four, so none of these scenes exist inThe Viscount Who Loved Me. Further, Eloise does not discover Lady Whistledown’s identity in book two, so the breakdown of her and Penelope’s friendship is a storyline created solely for the show.\n\nThe details of Mary, Kate, and Edwina Sharma\n\nIn season two, we are introduced to Mary, Kate, and Edwina Sharma, who arrive from India to debut their youngest daughter to London’s high society. But in the book, the Sharmas are the Sheffields and they come to London from the English countryside.\n\nThe love triangle between Edwina, Kate, and Anthony\n\nAnthony is on a quest to find a spouse and future mother of his children in season two of Bridgerton, and he eventually finds a suitable fit (or so he thought) in the season’s diamond, Edwina Sharma. Kate, Edwina’s protective older sister, believes that Anthony is a certified “Capital R Rake” and is no match for Edwina. Sharing a mutual dislike, Anthony cannot stand the fact that Kate is standing in the way of their marriage. But during his courtship with Edwina, Anthony and Kate fall deeply in love with each other. Try as they might to resist their feelings and put their familial duties first, their desires unfold on Anthony and Edwina’s wedding day, prompting the young diamond to run out of the church before the words “I do” are exchanged.\n\nIn The Viscount Who Loved Me, this love triangle is not nearly as dramatic. While Anthony does choose to court Edwina, the two never make it to the altar. She doesn’t have strong feelings for the viscount either, which contrasts from the love she ardently expresses for him in the Netflix series.\n\nEdmund Bridgerton’s death\n\nIt’s revealed in episode three that the patriarch of the Bridgerton family, Edmund, died suddenly of a bee sting at the age of 38. His traumatic passing makes Anthony, just 18 years old, the Viscount and head of the family. The show depicts that Edmund is stung while he and Anthony are in the gardens outside Aubrey Hall, and Lady Violet Bridgerton, who is very pregnant with Hyacinth, rushes to her husband’s side — but he dies almost instantly. In the book, Anthony learns of his death after he returns home from a ride with Benedict and encounters a weeping Daphne in the hallway.\n\nKate and Anthony’s first kiss\n\nIn the show, Kate and Anthony finally kiss in the church after Edwina calls off the wedding. But Kate and Anthony’s first kiss happens much earlier in Quinn’s novel. During an event at the Bridgerton home, Kate wanders into Anthony’s study for some solitude. Moments later, Anthony bursts in with a woman named Maria Rosso — whom the character Siena Rosso from season one is seemingly based on — and discovers Kate hiding under his desk. A heated confrontation turns into an unexpected moment of passion and here, the two lock lips.\n\nThe bee sting scene\n\nIn episode three of Bridgerton, Kate and Anthony are strolling through the gardens and having a tense conversation when a bee lands on Kate’s jacket. The two exchange the most intense gaze and when Kate tries to shoo the bee away, it stings her. Anthony, traumatized by the death of his father, descends into panic. Kate tries to calm the viscount down by placing his hand on her chest so he could feel her heartbeat.\n\nThis scene plays out a lot differently in the book. In The Viscount Who Loved Me, Anthony attempts to suck the venom (yes, really) out of Kate’s chest after the bee suddenly stings her. His mother and Lady Featherington catch the two in this rather compromising position, and because this is London in the year 1814, Anthony and Kate are forced to marry.\n\nKate’s accident\n\nIn both the book and the series, Kate is involved in a terrifying accident. At the end of the seventh episode, “Harmony,” a distressed Kate is riding her horse through the pouring rain, as the viscount follows behind and calls out for her. When she attempts a jump, Kate falls from her horse and lands on the ground, remaining unconscious for days.\n\nIn The Viscount Who Loved Me, Kate’s accident involves a carriage that crashes. Anthony witnesses this scary incident as well, but in the written version, Kate does not remain unconscious for long and breaks her leg.\n\nThe character of Theo Sharpe\n\nIn the second season of Bridgerton, Eloise is on a mission to discover who exactly Lady Whistledown is. In her quest, she meets Theo Sharpe, an assistant in the print shop where Lady Whistledown prints her gossip papers. They bond over their passion for social justice, and Theo eventually helps Eloise track down the mysterious writer’s true identity. Although Eloise never explicitly admits that she’s fallen in love with Theo, it’s evident in the way she talks about him to Penelope, and how hurt she is after their class differences ultimately tear them apart. Their connection made for a compelling, and eventually heartbreaking, storyline for Eloise, but it’s one that was invented only for the series. The character of Theo Sharpe does not exist in Quinn’s novel."
