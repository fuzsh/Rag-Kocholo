        "text": "When it comes to Whistler, I have my dining staples, which include the well-known fine dining institutions Araxi and Bearfoot Bistro. Alta Bistro is also a favourite, and as much of a “hidden gem” it once was, the secret is out and it is going strong into its fourth year. Finding a secret spot in a town as small and popular as Whistler is tricky – all the “local favourites” should be more or less exposed and discovered by now – but here are a few I find underrated or still rather “secret”.\n\n1) Wild Wood Pacific Bistro – It opened in 2002 and has won local awards, but it’s still a bit unknown to outsiders. It’s located inside the Crystal Lodge Hotel and it is catered to locals with a very reasonably-priced menu and portions. The breakfast and brunch is nothing fancy and neither is the ambiance, but it’s simple, family-friendly and all around solid with options for all ages. The “Sampler Benny” includes three Benedicts of your choice for $15, and they also have a delicious Pulled Pork French Toast for those who enjoy sweet and savoury.\n\n2) Aura at Nita Lake Lodge – It’s not in Whistler Village, but it’s 500 metres from the Whistler Creekside gondola on the valley trail. They offer a complementary shuttle to and from the village, but to be honest it’s a nice escape from the village. Aura restaurant has undergone a couple of chef changes in recent years, but I’ve always appreciated the stunning view and peaceful surroundings on the patio. From now until June 18 its offering a three-course spring menu for $35 for the “Indulge in Whistler” promotion. Also, don’t forget to check out its great little bakery, Fix Café, where they make very good Pumpkin & Coconut Loaf, Zucchini Blueberry Loaf, and brownies.\n\n3) Elements Urban Tapas – Elements is not-so-secret since it has been awarded as a brunch favourite numerous times by locals, but it flies under the radar inside the Summit Lodge & Spa, a boutique hotel in Whistler Village. The portions are too generous to call them “tapas”, but at these prices it’s hard not to over-order anyway. The monster-sized Honey Ham & Brie stuffed French Toast with maple syrup is enough to keep most full for the day, and the Potato Tartlets with chive sour cream and corn fritters are also worth trying. It’s actually sister restaurant to Wild Wood Pacific Bistro. Both are affordable dining and appropriate for all ages, however the menus are different, and Elements is the more playful and modern in style."
