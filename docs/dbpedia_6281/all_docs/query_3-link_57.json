        "text": "Ever since the release of Iron Man in 2008, the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) has been the dominant force in modern pop culture. From its humble beginnings, the brand has grown from strength to strength, first with successful sequels like Iron Man 2, then with team-up movies like The Avengers, then with crossover events such as Infinity War and Endgame.\n\nMarvel Studios has also widened its scope expanding into the universe with Guardians of the Galaxy, across time with Captain Marvel, into the Quantum Realm with Ant-Man, and now the multiverse with Loki, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and Doctor Strange 2.\n\nRead more: Actors with the most MCU appearances\n\nThe MCU has conquered the small screen too with the first canon TV series hitting Disney+ in 2021, so as the brand keeps on growing, we take a look at all the upcoming adventures planned in the Marvel realm.\n\nAgatha All Along | 19 September 2024 (Disney+)\n\nAgatha: All Along is a WandaVision spinoff which sees Kathryn Hahn reprise the role of Agatha Harkness for a nine-episode series. Other cast members include Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke and Patti LuPone.\n\nAgatha is the second Marvel character from a Disney+ show to have to star in a spinoff after Echo from Hawkeye.\n\nA brief synopsis describes the series as finding Agatha without her powers: “She can’t wait to go back to her old murderous ways only to find that she is powerless. The only way forward for her is to embark on a perilous quest to get her powers back with the help of an unlikely friend or two.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man | TBC (Disney+)\n\nAnimated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is a prequel to Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It was initially titled Spider-Man: Freshman Year and looks set to focus on Peter Parker's early days as the web-slinging hero.\n\nThe voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is yet to be announced. However, Jeff Trammell is to write and executive produce the show which will debut in late 2024.\n\nMarvel Zombies | TBC 2024 (Disney+)\n\nMarvel Zombies is an upcoming animated television series, which is a spin-off of What If...?. She-Hulk’s Zeb Wells is set to write and executive produce the four-episode series.\n\nWe know that Iman Vellani AKA Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel will reprise her role for the series but other than that, no further announcements have been made in terms of cast and production. We also know that it'll consist of four episodes and land at some point in 2024.\n\nEyes of Wakanda | TBC 2024 (Disney+)\n\nFollowing the box-office hit, Black Panther and its sequel, director Ryan Coogler announced that a television series is also on the way.\n\nIn early 2024, the series was confirmed to be titled Eyes of Wakanda and will feature a range of characters tracking down rare and dangerous vibranium artefacts across various time periods.\n\nNo casting details have been unveiled yet but the CG animated series is set to debut in late 2024.\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World | 14 February 2025\n\nAnthony Mackie will reprise his role as Sam Wilson but in the new role as Captain America replacing the outgoing Chris Evans in Captain America: Brave New World. The project was initially titled Captain America: New World Order but changed its name due to its links to conspiracy theories online.\n\nAnthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America), Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres) and Carl Lumbly (Isaiah Bradley), all return to join Tim Blake Nelson (The Leader) as well as Shira Haas (Sabra).\n\nHarrison Ford will also join the MCU in Captain America, replacing the late William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, who has risen to the post of President of the United States.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again | TBC 2025 (Disney+)\n\nDaredevil is being revived at Disney+ after Charlie Cox returned as Matt Murdock in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Vincent D’Onofrio reprised Kingpin in Hawkeye.\n\nJon Bernthal is also set to return as The Punisher in the much-anticipated nine-episode series. However, fans will have a while to wait before they can watch him in action, as the show isn’t expected to arrive until 2025.\n\nA trailer was shown behind closed doors at a Disney presentation in May 2024.\n\nThunderbolts | 2 May 2025\n\nMarvel enters the supervillain team-up genre with this highly secretive MCU project that will mark the final chapter of Phase 5 of the MCU. Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank, Paper Towns) will direct from a script by Black Widow’s Eric Pearson.\n\nIn the comics, the Thunderbolts were a team of heroes that were formed after the death of the Avengers, but who turned out to be acting as villains. Members have included Baron Zemo, Yelena Belova, Ghost, Abomination, John Walker and Taskmaster.\n\nThe cast includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Sebastian Stan,Olga Kurylenko and Top Gun: Maverick's Lewis Pullman.\n\nThe Fantastic Four | 25 July 2025\n\nThe Fantastic Four will make their long-awaited MCU debut as the first entry in Phase 6.\n\nPedro Pascal will play Dr. Reed Richards AKA Mr Fantastic, with Vanessa Kirby becoming Invisible Woman Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn playing Human Torch Johnny Storm and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm AKA The Thing.\n\nThe cast also includes Ozark’s Julia Garner, Natasha Lyonne, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich and Ralph Ineson, and will be set in a futuristic 1960s America during the space race.\n\nThe movie lost its initial director when Jon Watts quit to work on his upcoming Star Wars series. Instead, WandaVision’s Matt Shakman will direct.\n\nBlade | 7 November 2025\n\nHaving made his first appearance as part of the MCU in The Eternals, two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali will headline his own movie as Blade, the vampire-hunting bloodsucker previously played by Wesley Snipes.\n\nOriginally written by Watchmen’s Stacy Osei-Kuffour, Blade lost its director Bassam Tariq at the eleventh hour, throwing the production into last-minute turmoil. “It’s been an honour working with the wonderful folks at Marvel,” Tariq said in a statement. “We were able to put together a killer cast and crew. Eager to see where the next director takes the film.”\n\nYann Demange, the director of White Boy Rick, was hired to replace Tariq in November 2022, with Michael Starrbury writing a new script. Demange dropped out in June 2024 and is yet to be replaced.\n\nIronheart | TBC 2025 (Disney+)\n\nThis new Disney+ show stars Dominique Thorne as super genius Riri Williams, who has created the most advanced suit of armour since Iron Man. Ironheart made her MCU debut in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nThe synopsis explains: “Dominique Thorne returns as Riri Williams, a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world. Her unique take on building iron suits is both brilliant and flawed, and Ironheart delves into the dynamics of tech versus magic.”\n\nOriginally planned to debut in 2023, this six-episode series is now expected to arrive in late 2025 although an official release date has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday | 1 May, 2026\n\nRobert Downey Jr. will be returning to the MCU in Avengers: Doomsday — but this time as Victor Von Doom AKA Doctor Doom, alongside the studio’s new Fantastic Four.\n\nThe film was originally called The Kang Dynasty after Jonathan Majors’ character Conqueror, who appeared in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But Majors’ sudden departure from the MCU forced Marvel bosses back to the drawing board.\n\nInfinity War and Endgame helmers Joe and Anthony Russo will also be back to direct the two-parter, once again collaborating with their previous Avengers co-screenwriter Stephen McFeely.\n\nAvengers: Secret Wars | 7 May, 2027\n\nReleasing seven months after Avengers; Doomsday, Secret Wars will be the epic conclusion to Phase 6 of the MCU, and with it the Phases 4-5-6 arch known as The Multiverse Saga.\n\nIn the comics, the Secret Wars centered around multi-versal battle between all of Marvel's beloved characters. The film's title was originally confirmed in 2022 and survived Marvel's Kang issues to remain in place during Comic-Con 2024 where the Russos were confirmed to direct.\n\nWonder Man | TBC\n\nThis MCU series will focus on the Marvel character Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul Mateen II) who — in the comics — is the son of a wealthy industrialist who falls on hard times due to the growth of Stark Industries. In the show, he’s said to be an actor and stuntman.\n\nWilliams is imbued with ionic superpowers by Baron Zemo (Falcon and The Winter Soldier’s Daniel Bruhl) becoming an antagonist of The Avengers, before later joining their ranks. Reports suggest the show will be a Hollywood satire, with Sir Ben Kingsley's Iron Man 3 character Trevor Slattery set to appear.\n\nWonder Man was expected to arrive in late 2023 or early 2024 but was impacted by the Hollywood strikes and a production-related tragedy where a crew member sadly died after an on-set accident.\n\nIts release date remains unconfirmed.\n\nSpider-Man 4 | TBC\n\nTom Holland will return as Spider-Man for another MCU outing, having last played the character in No Way Home in 2021. The actor told Deadline in April 2024 that “everyone wants it to happen” and that Marvel has “the best in the business” working on the film.\n\n“The simple answer is that I’ll always want to do Spider-Man films,” he added. “I owe my life and career to Spider-Man. So the simple answer is yes. I’ll always want to do more.”\n\nIn mid-2024, Marvel boss Feige suggested that the film will have a new director due to previous Spidey-helmer Jon Watts becoming too in-demand.\n\nShang-Chi 2 | TBC\n\nSimu Liu will reprise the role of Xu Shang-Chi in Destin Daniel Cretton’s Shang-Chi 2. With the deal only being signed in December 2021, production has still not been announced so it is hard to determine when the sequel will be shot and subsequently released.\n\nAfter Cretton left Avengers 5 to focus solely on Shang-Chi 2, an update released in late 2023 suggests the sequel could be arriving at some point in late 2026 with the film’s plot including connective tissue that links both Avengers outings. Despite updates being scarce, Liu confirmed via Threads that the movie is indeed still going ahead, saying: \"I promise it’s happening.\"\n\nX-Men | TBA\n\nLike Deadpool and Fantastic Four, an X-Men-centric movie will also be part of the MCU following Disney’s purchase of 20th Century Fox.\n\nWith the cast and director yet to be announced the project is still a ways away. Wolverine made his MCU debut in Deadpool & Wolverine and in early 2024, Michael Lesslie, writer of The Hunger Games prequel The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, was confirmed to be writing its script.\n\nArmor Wars | TBA\n\nDon Cheadle is set to reprise the role as James Rhodes/War Machine in the upcoming movie Armor Wars, with a script from Yassir Lester. Ant-Man and The Wasp’s Walton Goggins will also appear as Sonny Burch, with Sam Rockwell rumoured to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of Justin Hammer.\n\nThe project was originally conceived as a Disney+ series but evolved into a full movie in late 2022. Producer Nate Moore explained: “When you’re talking about a show that wants to be about seeing all the cool armours and Don Cheadle interacting with all these armours and, sort of, the legacy of Tony Stark? That became kind of cost prohibitive to do as a show.”"
