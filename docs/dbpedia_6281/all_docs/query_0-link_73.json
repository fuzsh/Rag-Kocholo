        "text": "Chelsea, 160 years ago, was still a modest backwater, a rackety, down-at-heel place whose inns and taverns perched on the riverfront. Sailors and prostitutes knocked about its old wharves and mudbanks, and the Thames was only now and then illuminated by fireworks from the nearby pleasure gardens of Cremorne. One or two celebrities – Turner, incognito, and Thomas Carlyle – were early adopters of tumbledown Chelsea, but it wasn’t until the building boom of the 1860s that the old village began to break up and give way to a thriving imperial class. The Embankment was the most obvious sign of its emergent prosperity. The Cadogan estate cut swaths through the poor housing and began laying out new streets in their place. One such, named in 1875, was Tite Street.\n\nIn time this street became the centre of London’s fin-de-siecle art scene, which the historian Devon Cox has made the basis of an engrossing, detailed and somewhat melancholy group biography. Three titans of the era naturally dominate its pages, though in the background swells a lively and ever-changing cast of artists major and minor, muses, models, critics, princes and paupers, actors, rent boys, property speculators and assorted other villains. Its principal celebrity, and the neighbourhood’s trailblazer, was James Whistler, the US expat whose ghostly Thames nocturnes in some way shape our picture of mid-Victorian London, even of moonlight itself. Having haunted the area for years, Whistler commissioned his architect friend EW Godwin to design a residence for him on Tite Street; it was the first studio-house on the block, and became known as the White House. The name suited its presidential occupant, though no amount of grandstanding could save him from debt and eventual abandonment of the address, which fell into the possession of a hated rival.\n\nWith bumptious and characteristic self-confidence Whistler soon returned to the street from exile (in Venice) and moved into the house next door, which he set about decorating with blue and white porcelain, painted butterflies and Japanese fans: visiting ladies were advised not to wear black and white lest they clashed with the colour scheme. His home also became a magnet to aspiring younger artists who would dress, paint and pose like him. “There is one god,” the young Walter Sickert wrote, “and his name is Jimmy.” Devotion came at a price. If Sickert ever got in his way at the studio Whistler would snap, “Shove along, Walter, shove along.”\n\nNot all his admirers were so slavish. Oscar Wilde, resident in bachelor quarters opposite in 1881, could match his friend Whistler in narcissism and surpass him in wit. Initially twinned as “poster boys for the aesthetic movement”, the two would eventually fall out, neither prepared to accept that limelight could be shared. Wilde had helped save Frank Miles, his flatmate, from both blackmailers and the police, a rescue he was unable to effect on his own behalf some years later. He returned for a second spell on the street as a married man in 1885, hosting famous “at homes” at no 34 with his wife, Constance, while slowly – inexorably – turning the house into his fateful closet. That same year a Liberal MP, Henry Labouchère, introduced an amendment to a criminal law specifying that homosexual acts – now vilified under the term “gross indecency” – were punishable by two years’ hard labour. A decade later, Wilde would be this amendment’s most conspicuous victim.\n\nHe was already aware of the dangers prowling outside. At the back of Tite Street ran an alley, Paradise Walk, consisting of slum tenements from which – as Wilde’s son Cyril recalled – “the sounds of brawling rose nightly”. That mixture of bohemian glamour and brooding violence would inform the composition of Wilde’s first and only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The book would be adduced in evidence against the writer during his prosecution in 1895. In a freak of historical irony, the presiding judge in the affair was Justice Alfred Wills, who sent Wilde down for two years with words of exorbitant severity: “People who can do these things must be dead to all sense of shame ... It is the worst case I have ever tried,” he said. The judge, plainly no adherent of Christ’s message to love thy neighbour, lived at this time at Chelsea Lodge, no 58 Tite Street.\n\nMeanwhile, amid all the celebrity comings and goings in the street – the Prince of Wales, Lillie Langtry and Ellen Terry were among those to grace its pavements – another famous name had quietly taken up residence in 1886. John Singer Sargent, from a rich family of American expats, was less self-important than his old neighbours Whistler and Wilde, but he would come to challenge them in terms of accomplishment. Styled by Rodin as “the Van Dyck” of his times, Sargent became prolific both as a portraitist (three to four sitters a day) and a society host. His pictures are among the most handsomely reproduced in a book that Frances Lincoln publishers, honouring this artistic triumvirate, have made a beautiful object in itself.\n\nI was also pleased to learn of Anna Lea Merritt, a US artist who worked on Tite Street in the face of widowhood and deepening penury. At a time when women were still outsiders in the predominantly masculine world of art she endured, though she never forgot the struggle it had taken: “The chief obstacle to a woman’s success is that she can never have a wife,” she wrote, shrewdly. One could have wished that Cox had trawled the neighbourhood a little deeper still and found room for other Whistler disciples such as Theodore Roussel and the brilliant painter of Cheyne Walk and the Thames Paul Fordyce Maitland, who lived a short distance away on Edith Terrace."
