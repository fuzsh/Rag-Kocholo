        "text": "Microdosing. You’ve probably heard the word, but what is it? And what does it mean? One of our readers, who we’re going to call Ray, tells his story\n\nI hold my breath. The blindfold fits comfortably over my eyes. Electronica plays in my ears and flows through my mind. And in the darkness, there’s something there, something’s stirring in the distance, I look more closely. Shapes begin to form, patterns start to morph and travel towards me. And then the colours, oh my god, the colours… And I exhale.\n\nAs I lay down, I remember that gravity is my friend. A wave of relaxation washes over my body and I sink into the mattress. Am I in a different reality? I don’t think so. Am I “astral planning”? Much as I love the poetry of the description, born from the same hippy roots of my youth, unfortunately, I have to say No. Have I achieved a higher state of consciousness? Oh, stop it. (Sorry, but I give short shrift to spiritual narcissism). Very simply, I am stimulating every single Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in my brain. And, in doing so, this stunning visualisation of geometrically-shaped tunnels and spaces (often called the “Waiting Room” in DMT circles) is the mind’s expression of that neurological activity.\n\nDid I think that I would ever revisit the psychedelic experiences of my youth? Good god, no. I thought I was done and dusted with that. I have a senior role in an international business. I manage staff. I have a family. A mortgage to pay. If I’m honest, I also feared that I would do the same amount of damage as I did to the teenager in Round 1. And yet, now in my mid-Fifties, and only recently been diagnosed with autism, I’ve stumbled across a psychedelic, Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT as it’s commonly known, a key constituent in potions such as Ayahuasca, used in shamanic ceremonies in South America and Indonesia alike, and found that, for my mental health, and at low dosage levels, it is singularly the most effective medicine I have ever taken to manage the effects of “hyperfocus” (a spectrum condition which has its advantages, but is also utterly exhausting).\n\nAside from being visually stunning, it’s the only drug I’ve taken where I feel better afterwards. Sometimes, depending on my work / life stress levels, the level of burnout at the time of the session, the alleviation I experience after the trip, the clarity of thinking can last for hours, days or even weeks.\n\nWith the pressures and responsibility that inevitably mount up as we progress through life, time becomes more precious. The ability to take some time out, and even 15 minutes will do, to meditate in the present, to reset your mind, clean out the complex mechanic of the brain (give the engine some fresh oil, if you like) is a hugely valuable exercise. Being present, truly present, is a rare and precious thing. And trust me, if you wash out your mind with DMT, and release the stale thoughts that are stuck in those receptors, you can be nothing but present.\n\nI find most people I meet live in the past, often with regret, or live in the future with hopes and ambition at best, or pressure and anxiety at worse. Very few people actually live in the present. It takes bravery to be present. But if you value your existence, whether you choose the same path as me, or you find your own, please just give yourself the permission, the space, the moment, the vulnerability and the belief in yourself, to be present, to love yourself, and do so in a safe physical and mental environment. Because, believe me, your grey matter is not grey. Far from it.\n\nI\n\nf our recent experience of the aurora borealis demonstrates anything, it shows us that We are the Witness. When, after one session, I realised that simple fact was the meaning of life, or at least my purpose for existence, so much societal pressure (you know, the definitions of success that are often impressed on us, generally from marketeers trying to sell us something) was lifted from my shoulders. We are the Witness. We are the Consciousness of the Universe. Perhaps even the Multiverse. (Well, why on earth should the Big Bang have occurred just the once, that’s crazy thinking, no?)\n\nAstrophysicists across the world are now leaning towards the idea that actually there are billions of other life forms out there. So where are they? The answer may be that we’re looking in the wrong place, or rather, with the wrong telescope. When I realised the irony of trying to see these geometric shapes with my eyes while blindfolded, and used what some cultures called The Third Eye, suddenly the sphere of consciousness that is “Ray” travelled further back in the physical space that is my grey matter, expanded to the size of a field of corn. I could even see behind me. And that begs the question, is DMT the telescope that we’ve been seeking? Or is it just shits and giggles? I don’t know, but as I travel down this road, I’ll keep an open mind.\n\nWhile I’m passionate about psychedelics and regard them as a therapeutical medicine rather than a party drug, I’m very aware that the Government does not agree with me and you should be aware of this.\n\nBut there are other downsides of an unregulated black market economy. Good quality DMT is hard to find. If your DMT is dark in colour, is harsh on the throat, or smells “of the countryside”, let alone plastic or rubber, then it is not pure enough for microdosing, or for any dosing for that matter. I have found that the vaping fluid should look like a lager in colour. If it looks like a bitter or, even worse, a stout, then please respect yourself and steer well clear. The good stuff is a blonde, not a brunette.\n\nBe safe. Ray, Brighton, 2024.\n\nEditor’s note: The Whistler does not condone Ray’s thoughts and opinions. We chose to publish this article as we know there are many microdosers in the city, probably in our readership. But remember, what works for Ray may not work for anyone else."
