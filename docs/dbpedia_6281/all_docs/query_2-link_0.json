Directed by George Sherman, the production features Richard Dix, Leslie Brooks and Michael Duane.[1] It is the sixth of Columbia Pictures' eight \"Whistler\" films produced in the 1940s, all but the last starring Dix.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nRalph Harrison (Richard Dix) is married to Edith (Mary Currier), a rich woman who has been suffering heart attacks. Upset by her condition, he finds consoling companionship with an artist's model, the unscrupulous gold-digger Kay (Leslie Brooks).\n\nHe falls in love with Kay. Edith's health then improves. Edith overhears Ralph professing his love for Kay. Edith threatens Ralph, saying she's going to take him out of her will. He decides to poison her, with her own medicine, before she can meet with her lawyers.\n\nAfter Edith dies, Ralph marries Kay, who becomes suspicious of how Edith died and worried for her own fate. Finding incriminating diary pages and the medicine, she has the medicine analyzed, discovering that it was poisoned.\n\nRalph overhears Kay's phone conversation with the lab. Pretending to embrace her, he strangles her to death, just as the police arrive and arrest him for murder - but not for the murder of Edith, because she had not taken the poisoned medicine but died of a heart attack.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Dix as Ralph Harrison\n\nLeslie Brooks as Kay Morrell\n\nMichael Duane as Artist Jim Calhoun\n\nMary Currier as Edith Marie Harrison\n\nMona Barrie as Linda Vail\n\nRay Walker as Joseph Aloysius 'Joe' Conroy\n\nClaire Du Brey as Laura - Harrison's Servant\n\nOtto Forrest as The Whistler\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nTV Guide rated it 3/5 stars and called it \"engrossing as usual and well acted\".[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
