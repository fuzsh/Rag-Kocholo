        "text": "On Tour with Prism Book Tours\n\nThe Billionaire’s Secret\n\nBy Meghann Whistler\n\nChristian Romance\n\nPaperback & ebook, 195 Pages\n\nOctober 11, 2021 by Meghann Whistler\n\nHe’s a billionaire hiding a devastating diagnosis. She’ll do whatever it takes to help her sick, matchmaking mom. A freak accident throws them together, but will his big secret tear them apart?\n\nWhen Ryan Lawson’s business partners force him to go on a wilderness retreat to come to terms with a shocking diagnosis, the last thing on Ryan’s mind is romance. But when he’s stranded in the woods with a sweet young event planner, all thoughts of business take a back seat to her girl-next-door appeal.\n\nFresh off a bad breakup, Zara Georgopoulos comes to Vermont to help her terminally ill mom work through her bucket list—not fall in love with a man who’s the exact opposite of her usual type. But when Ryan starts working his way into her heart with his kindness and generosity, she needs to make a decision: Trust the biotech billionaire not to walk all over her, or go back to guarding her heart.\n\nStuck in the wilds of Vermont, they forge a tenuous connection. When Ryan finally shares the truth about his illness, will it bring them closer together . . . or shatter Zara’s trust in him for good?\n\nInspired by 2 Corinthians 12:9, The Billionaire’s Secret is a sweet inspirational romance with a swoony hero, LOTS of entertaining banter, and a strong Christian message.

I loved these two characters. Ryan was a smart man who ended up also being very wealthy through some successful biomedical innovations and business decisions throughout the years. But he was struggling with a health diagnosis he had recently received and the very real truth that all of his money could not solve his problems.\n\nZara was a nice woman who loved her mother and wanted to do all she could to care for her as she struggled with a recurrence of cancer. Zara was also coming off of a relationship that ended very badly.\n\nThese two characters had such a great connection right from the start, yet there were quite a few struggles for them to immediately overcome. I thought the flow to Zara and Ryan’s relationship was very realistic. They both had reasons to try friendship first, yet they were drawn to each other and wanted more. As Ryan’s wealth became obvious, I appreciated that Zara wasn’t interested in him because of his money. In fact, she wanted to make sure he wasn’t trying to buy her favor. Ryan’s diagnosis was something he was very worried about bringing up, thinking it could cause the end to any romantic possibilities. I thought the way things played out regarding his illness was also very realistic.\n\nI loved this book from the start to the finish. There was a beautiful faith message woven into the novel and I so enjoyed the bonus epilogue that was available to sign up for at the end of the book. I am really looking forward to reading more books in this series.\n\n(5 stars)\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMeghann Whistler writes sweet Christian romance novels that won’t make your grandmother blush.\n\nHer debut novel, Falling for the Innkeeper, was a #1 bestseller in the Clean & Wholesome Romance category on Amazon.ca. It was also named one of “Six Sensational 2020 Debut Series Romances” by the American Library Association’s Booklist Reader, and is currently a finalist for the 2021 Book Buyers Best award.\n\nBefore settling down with her rocket scientist husband and raising three rambunctious boys, Meghann earned a B.A. in English from Amherst College and an M.F.A. in creative writing from Emerson College.\n\nShe is grateful to be living her dream of writing sweet, hopeful stories that demonstrate the power of love and grace.\n\nWebsite | Goodreads | Facebook | Bookbub | Amazon | Newsletter\n\nTour Schedule\n\nTour Giveaway\n\nA 1000-piece Vermont jigsaw puzzle\n\nA “My Weekend Is All Booked” adult coloring book\n\nA “My Weekend Is All Booked” mug\n\nA signed copy of Meghann’s debut novel, Falling for the Innkeeper\n\n(US Only)\n\nEnds October 20, 2021"
