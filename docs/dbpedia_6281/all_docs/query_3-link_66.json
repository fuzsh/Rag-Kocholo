        "text": "Need a new series to binge watch? Then Netflix's latest crime thriller, Fool Me Once, is one to put on your list.\n\nThe series, adapted from Harlan Coben's best-selling novel, follows Maya (Michelle Keegan) who is dealing with the murder of her husband, Joe (Richard Armitage), but then sees him alive on her secret nanny cam.\n\nSo, what happened to Joe and was it really him on the camera? Plus, who killed Maya's sister, Claire? Here is the ending of Fool Me Once explained.\n\nJoe killed Claire\n\nIn the final episode, Maya tells Shane that she suspected Joe of killing her sister, Claire.\n\nClaire had tracked down Corey the Whistle – who leaked footage of Maya killing civilians in the army – and agreed to help him investigate the Burkett family in exchange for him not releasing the audio, which showed that Maya directly went against orders.\n\nSoon, Joe learned that Claire had been leaking damning information so he killed her, took back the evidence and staged it as a robbery gone wrong.\n\nMaya killed Joe\n\nIn flashbacks, we learn that after Maya began to suspect Joe, she asked Shane to secretly test a bullet from their gun to which she learned it was the weapon used to kill Claire.\n\nSo, she called Joe and asked to meet him in the park where she confronted him about the murder. Before this, she had swapped their handgun for one without bullets and when she confronted him, Joe tried to shoot Maya only to realise the gun was empty.\n\nThis confirmed all of Maya's theories, so, she shot and killed Joe and covered it up by telling the police that nearby bikers tried to rob them.\n\nAs for the nanny cam, Maya confronts the nanny who reveals that it was a deep fake made by her and her partner, paid for by Maya's mother-in-law, Judith, who suspected Maya was lying about Joe's death.\n\nMaya confronts the Burketts\n\nAt the Burkett Mansion, Maya confronts Judith, Caroline and Neil for their involvement in their pharmaceutical company's unlawful dealings (such as selling harmful medicine, which DS Sami Kierce had taken causing his blackouts) as well as faking the nanny cam and Claire's murder.\n\nShe tells them about Joe's involvement in the deaths of his friend, Theo Mora, Tommy Dark and his brother, Andrew, who wanted to come clean about their role in Theo's death to which Joe pushed him off their boat.\n\nThen, she admits to killing Joe but reveals there is still evidence of their company's illegal practices, to which Judith says they should make a deal to blame everything on Joe. But, Maya disagrees.\n\nNeil kills Maya\n\nThen, Neil picks up Maya's gun she had confronted them with earlier and shockingly shoots and kills her.\n\nBut, Judith looks up at their mantelpiece and spots a secret camera, to which we see that Corey and Sami had been watching via a livestream they set up to expose the Burketts, which was also watched by millions of others.\n\nSami breaks down to which Corey suggests that Maya knew how this would end as she put her gun down and had accepted responsibility for Joe's murder, as well as killing civilians in combat.\n\nThen, in a flash forward of 18 years, Sami and Maya's brother-in-law and Claire's husband, Eddie, are at hospital where Maya's daughter, Lily, is now all grown up and has given birth to her own daughter.\n\nWe learn that Eddie took Lily in after Maya's death and Shane is also at the hospital. Then, Lily tells them that she wants to call her daughter Maya, after her mum.\n\nFool Me Once is streaming on Netflix now."
