        "text": "David recently made a headline appearance on ITV’s primetime Saturday show, Game Of Talents. The programme, hosted by Vernon Kay, sees performers from a wide variety of backgrounds appear in front of teams made up of a member of the public and a celebrity.\n\nEpisode 3 saw Stephen Mulhern and Emma Willis join contestants to try to figure out the talents on display, from a list of skills including drummer, juggler and, of course, whistler. To help the teams work out the secret talents, a series of clues are provided. David walked out to an instrumental version of Megahn Trainor’s Lips Are Movin’, giving Emma and her sidekick their first clue.\n\nNext up came a Good Morning Britain skit, where presenters Ranvir Singh and Susanna Reid read out spoof headlines, all with subtle nods to the fact that the hidden talent was to do with whistling.\n\nIf you want to see if the contestants guess correctly, and to watch David perform Nessun Dorma, you can catch up with the show by going to th ITV Hub (you will need to sign up for a free account). David appears from 09:58.\n\nFresh from appearing in a Klarna ad headed up by hip-hop legend Snoop Dogg, David recently added another big-name brand to his portfolio by having his rendition of “Post Horn Galop” featured in Apple’s latest advertising campaign for its iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nTimed to coincide with the return of the NHL (National Hockey League) season in the USA and Canada, the track provides an apt backdrop to the 40-second commercial, as Vegas Golden Knights players Marc-André Fleury and Mark Stone tape the new Apple device to various parts of their ice hockey equipment and skate around the rink capturing increasingly bizarre videos of their antics.\n\n“It’s a real win to know the advertisement is travelling the world with me accompanying it,” David recently told the Oldham Chronicle.\n\nThe advert is the latest in Apple’s “Shot on iPhone 11” campaign, which has seen the phone used to film some pretty remarkable footage around the globe.\n\n“Post Horn Galop” appears on David’s “Whistling Down The Wind” album, which is available to buy on CD, or to download from iTunes.\n\nFresh from working with pop music legend Benny Anderson of ABBA, David has yet again been mixing with the stars in his latest project.\n\nSwedish financial tech giant Klarna, valued at $2.5 billion last year, has gone all gangsta in its latest ad campaign, enlisting the services of none other than hip-hop supremo Snoop Dogg – and they’ve brought David along for the ride too. His track “Czardas” features prominently in the new campaign, which sees Snoop surrounded by a gang of well-groomed Afghan hounds.\n\nKlarna’s campaign shows the LA rap star – who’s temporarily renamed himself “Smooth Dog”, as well as investing some of his fortune into the company – enjoying the finer things in life while spreading the cost of his luxurious purchases.\n\nSnoop Dogg, real name Calvin Broadus, told Forbes magazine: “I’ve been doing business in Europe for years with fashion brands, telecommunication companies and more. I’ve endorsed them, advised them, and now I’m looking to invest in them. I plan to keep growing the portfolio, ya dig?”\n\nKlarna”s CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski also told Forbes: “We were wondering who is the smoothest person alive, that was really the background of how the name Snoop Dogg popped up in our heads.”\n\nSmoothest person, smoothest ad campaign and world’s smoothest whistler all in one place. We’ll sip an ounce to that.\n\nDavid’s album “Whistling Down The Wind”, which features “Czardas”, is available to buy on CD and as a download from the iTunes Store.\n\nThose of a sensitive disposition should look away now. David has recently been lending his whistling talent to the soundtrack of a spooky new children’s TV series.\n\nCreeped Out is an anthology of modern-day ghost stories which aired on CBBC (formerly known as Children’s BBC).\n\nThe series, which premiered on Halloween this year, is a British-Canadian production in a similar vein to classic spooky shows such as Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories and The Twilight Zone. Each week begins with an appearance from “The Curious”, a mysterious whistling story collector. With his face always concealed by a featureless cardboard mask, you know you’re in trouble if he turns up on your street.\n\nThe soundtrack to the series was composed by Joe Kraemer, the man behind the music on Hollywood blockbuster movies such as Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Jack Reacher. David’s whistling can be heard throughout the six-part series, bringing a sinister air to the already spooky goings on.\n\nIf you missed out when the series originally aired, you can catch up on the BBC’s iPlayer. If you find yourself gripped with fear but unable to look away then fear not, there are more episodes to come at the beginning of 2018.\n\nFollowing on from his successful slot on Australia’s biggest breakfast TV show, Sunrise, David Morris has once again wowed Antipodean audiences with another appearance on Australian TV; this time on Oz’s answer to This Morning – The Morning Show.\n\nIn a segment cheekily titled “The Morning Show Off”, David was interviewed by hosts Kylie Gillies and Larry Emdur, and asked a range of questions about his rise to the top of the world whistling pile. He even took a few requests, much to the hosts’ delight.\n\nYou can watch the whole interview by following this link."
