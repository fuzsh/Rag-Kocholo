A TV adaptation of \"9 to 5\" ran for five seasons—on ABC, from 1982 to 1983, and in first-run syndication, from 1986 to 1988.

Although the movie was a critical flop, it gained a cult following among young men and is largely responsible for launching Carrey's film career. From 1995 until 2000, an animated TV version of \"Ace Ventura,\" loosely based on the movie, saw its zany lead character, voiced by Michael Daingerfield, solve creature-based cases with an emphasis on toilet humor. The show aired for three seasons.\n\nAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974)\n\n- Director: Martin Scorsese\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.3\n\n- Metascore: 78\n\n- Runtime: 112 minutes\n\nThis 1974 Martin Scorsese dramedy follows Alice, played by Ellen Burstyn, a widow and single mom who heads with her son to Monterrey, California, to launch a singing career. Burstyn won Best Actress at the 47th Academy Awards, and the movie inspired the sitcom \"Alice,\" which aired on CBS from 1976 to 1985. In the TV show, Linda Lavin plays Alice, who starts her life over again with her young son—this time in Phoenix. Many of the episodes take place at the diner where Alice works, and Vic Tayback, who played Mel, was the only actor to reprise his role from the film.\n\nAlien Nation (1988)\n\n- Director: Graham Baker\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: 45\n\n- Runtime: 91 minutes\n\n\"Alien Nation\" imagines a world where an alien race known only as the \"Newcomers\" assimilate to the local population of Los Angeles, and an extraterrestrial named Sam Francisco, played by Mandy Patinkin, becomes the first Newcomer police detective. Sam teams up with veteran policeman Matthew, played by James Caan, to investigate a recent homicide.

However, when they get there, they must contend with a con artist cat called Cat R. Waul, who has made the false claim as part of his own worrisome agenda. The movie was created by Steven Spielberg's Amblimation animation studio, and led to a one-season CBS series continuing Fievel's everyday misadventures. The series heavily promoted literacy, and episode conflicts were often resolved when young Fievel used his reading skills.\n\nYou may also like: 101 sports documentaries worth streaming now\n\nArmy of Darkness (1992)\n\n- Director: Sam Raimi\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Metascore: 59\n\n- Runtime: 81 minutes\n\nThis third installment in the \"Evil Dead\" franchise centers on cynical hardware store employee Ash, played by Bruce Campbell, who is accidentally sent back in time to A.D. 1300.

Wiatt, a young woman who suddenly inherits custody of her long-lost cousin's baby after she dies.

He becomes determined to whip the ragtag group of kids into shape as they take on an ultra-competitive California league.

One is Jasmin, played by Marianne Sägebrecht, a German tourist who becomes stranded after fighting with her husband on vacation and wandering to the nearest public setting—an isolated truck stop café. CCH Pounder plays Brenda, the short-tempered owner who eventually warms to Jasmin. The TV version of \"Bagdad Cafe\" ran for one season on CBS from 1990 to 1991, starring Whoopi Goldberg and Jean Stapleton as the lead women. In the series, the tourist was American and not German.\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\n- Director: Tim Burton\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Metascore: 70\n\n- Runtime: 92 minutes\n\nTim Burton's beloved creepy comedy begins as a young couple, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, die in a car accident, then find themselves stuck haunting their house when a new family moves in. Their attempts to scare the new tenants away attract an obnoxious spirit named Beetlejuice, played by Michael Keaton, who becomes a menace to the homeowners' sulky teenage daughter, Lydia, played by Winona Ryder.

It stars Michael Jai White as the titular character, an A-list action star who wages war with President Nixon after \"The Man\" kills his only brother. An animated TV show of the same name was released on Cartoon Network from 2012 to 2015, as Black Dynamite and his friends engage in over-the-top misadventures in the '70s. Many celebrities of the time appeared as fictional characters, from Elvis Presley to Spike Lee.\n\nBlade (1998)\n\n- Director: Stephen Norrington\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.1\n\n- Metascore: 45\n\n- Runtime: 120 minutes\n\nIn this superhero horror film, Blade, played by Wesley Snipes, is a Dhampir, a human with vampire-like strength. He teams up with his mentor Abraham Whistler and hematologist Karen Jenson to avenge his mother's death and eradicate vampires. The movie garnered a cult following and spawned a short-lived live-action TV adaptation that ran on Spike TV for 12 episodes in 2006. Series writer Geoff Johns told Wizard magazine that \"the network didn't want to cancel it, I just think Spike TV is still a young network, and the price it was costing to make … they just weren't able to do it.\"\n\nBlue Thunder (1983)\n\n- Director: John Badham\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.4\n\n- Metascore: 66\n\n- Runtime: 109 minutes\n\n\"Blue Thunder\" follows Roy Scheider's character Frank Murphy, a Los Angeles police officer who's tapped to do a test run of the film's titular high-tech experimental attack helicopter. After learning that the government plans to use Blue Thunder for unethical surveillance and crowd control, Frank and his colleagues fight to stop their plans. A TV action drama of the same name aired from January until April 1984, relying heavily on stock footage from the original movie. The show failed to find a viewership, which wasn't helped by the fact that a similar helicopter show—CBS' \"Airwolf\"—was airing on TV around the same time.\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969)\n\n- Director: Paul Mazursky\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n- Metascore: 72\n\n- Runtime: 105 minutes\n\nThe infamous comedy \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" sees four friends attend a risque workshop together. It functioned as a satire of 1960s wife-swapping and illegitimate psychological trends and received four Oscar nominations. Seven episodes of a TV sitcom adaptation were broadcast in 1973, featuring then-racy plotlines that included things like premarital relations and skinny dipping.

The film received largely poor reviews—with an approval rating of only 35%—but an acclaimed, darker TV version aired on The WB and UPN from 1997 to 2003. The series' popularity led to a spin-off show called \"Angel.\"\n\nYou may also like: 20 of the most controversial horror films\n\nBustin' Loose (1981)\n\n- Directors: Oz Scott, Michael Schultz\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n- Metascore: 55\n\n- Runtime: 94 minutes\n\n\"Bustin' Loose\" centers on gruff ex-con Joe Braxton, played by Richard Pryor, who begrudgingly agrees to escort a teacher named Vivian, played by Cicely Tyson, and her special education students from Philadelphia to the Pacific Northwest, where Vivian plans to start a new school for them.
