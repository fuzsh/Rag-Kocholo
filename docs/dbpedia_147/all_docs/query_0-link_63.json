We are continuing to process supercentenarian validation cases at this stage. Places of birth are listed according to their modern day country. However this does not always reflect the nationality or ethnicity of a supercentenarian. In addition, France has overseas regions and departments that are integral parts of the country. This includes French Guiana in South America, Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean, and Mayotte and RÃ©union off the coast of Africa. As these do not geographically lie within Europe, supercentenarians from there are not included in this table."
