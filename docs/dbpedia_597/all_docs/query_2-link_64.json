        "text": "On Sep­tember 1, 1939, just before Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland that marked t­he beginning of World War II, Zygmunt Klukowski, a young Polish doctor, confided in his diary that everyone was talking about war. \"Everybody,\" he continued, \"is sure that we will win.\" The reality was startlingly different.\n\nNazi Germany's war with Poland, begun on September 1, was an uneven contest. Five German armies with 1.5 million men, 2,000 tanks, and 1,900 modern aircraft faced fewer than a million Polish troops with less than 500 aircraft and a small number of armored vehicles. In addition, German planning and technical support -- and German understanding of the importance of modern tactical airpower -- gave the aggressor great advantages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin five days, German forces occupied all of the frontier zones. By September 7, forward units were only 25 miles from Warsaw, the Polish capital. Polish air forces were eliminated, and the Polish army was split and encircled. By September 17, the war was virtually over. Ten days later, after a devastating air assault, ­Warsaw surrendered. \"We were not yet ready,\" wrote Dr. Klukowski two weeks later, \"to discuss the causes of our defeat...This is a fact, but we just can't believe it.\"\n\n­This was the war Adolf Hitler had hoped for in 1939. But in addition to the localized conflict with Poland, the German invasion provoked a global conflict. Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany on September 3 when it became clear that negotiating a German withdrawal was hopeless. In Britain and France, the populations had braced themselves for war in the closing weeks of the summer. There was little popular enthusiasm for war, but a strong wave of anti-German and anti-Fascist sentiment produced a resigned recognition that Adolf Hitler would only stop if he was faced by force.\n\nAlmost immediately, the British and French empires (except for Ireland) joined the contest, turning it into a worldwide war, fought not only in Europe but across the oceans. German invasion also triggered Soviet Union intervention. The terms of the German-Soviet pact, signed in August 1939, gave Joseph Stalin a sphere of influence in eastern Poland. On September 17, once it was clear that Poland was close to defeat, Red Army units moved into Poland and met up with victorious German troops along a prearranged frontier. On September 28, the two dictatorships signed another treaty, which divided Poland between them.\n\nFor the Western powers, this provoked fears of a totalitarian alliance against them. For Poland, dismemberment and harsh totalitarian rule was the reality. Britain and France did nothing to help their smaller ally. Their military staffs had drawn up a \"war plan\" during the summer of 1939 in which the loss of Poland was accepted as inevitable. The core of the plan was to blockade and contain Nazi Germany until the war of attrition forced the Germans to abandon the contest as they had done in 1918. Britain and France expected a war of at least three years. This explains why for the first six months of the war the Western states did very little. The lull was nicknamed the \"Phony War\" -- a war with no fighting.\n\nA small amount of naval activity did occur, which gave citizens on both sides something to cheer about. In December 1939, Britain's Royal Navy so damaged the German pocket battleship Graf Spee that it was scuttled in the South Atlantic. Conversely, German submarines began to sink Allied merchant ships. On October 14, 1939, a German submarine managed to penetrate the defenses of the main British naval base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, and there sank the battleship Royal Oak. The Germans bombed Polish citizens mercilessly, but for a while refrained from bombing cities in the West. The British only dropped leaflets on German cities.\n\nThe chief beneficiary of the war in Poland was the Soviet Union. Suffering almost no casualties, the Red Army took parts of Poland that had been seized by Russia and Austria back in the 18th century but returned to Poland after World War I. The region was integrated at once into the Soviet system.\n\nMore than one million Poles, those regarded as a threat to the Communist order, were deported to labor camps in the Soviet Union. The three Baltic States -- Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia -- had been assigned to the Soviet Union sphere by the August and September agreements. They were compelled by Soviet pressure to accept Soviet military garrisons and political advisers on their soil.\n\nIn the fall of 1939, the USSR demanded that the Finnish government cede some territory and allow bases on Finnish soil. Joseph Stalin had, in fact, already drawn up plans for a Communist Finland, and he expected the same response as the Baltic States had given.\n\nInstead, Finland rejected the Soviet demands, and on November 30 Soviet forces invaded along the entire Finnish frontier. Finland's army of 200,000 mounted a spirited defense. Only after the mobilization of further Soviet forces in February 1940 did Finnish resistance wear down. Finland sought an armistice on March 6, and a week later it conceded all the territory and a base that had been originally demanded.\n\nFor Adolf Hitler, the Soviet advance in Eastern Europe and the spread of Communist influence were prices he had to pay for securing the German rear while Nazi Germany attacked Britain and France. But it was a dangerous situation. In October 1939, he hinted to his military staff that he would settle with the USSR as soon as he could. He hoped the West might seek terms, but when it became clear they were serious about war, he planned to attack the French front in November 1939. Poor weather prevented it, and Hitler reluctantly accepted a postponement until spring.\n\nUrged forward by the German navy, Hitler decided to seize Norway and Denmark for the naval war against British trade supplies from America. What had begun as a war to extend German power in Eastern Europe had become an open and unpredictable conflict with the intervention of Britain and France. Only in Poland was the war really over. Dr. Klukowski watched in dismay as German troops looted shops and churches and forced Jews to give up their valuables and clean the streets. As he wrote late in 1939, \"It is really hard to live in slavery.\"\n\nFollow the events of the first week of World War II in early September 1939, on the next page.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorld War II officially began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Below is a timeline tracing some of the important events of the first week of September, 1939.\n\nWorld War II Timeline: September 1-September 6\n\nSeptember 1: World War II begins as the Germans invade Poland with a three-front Blitzkrieg. They attack the Polish army with an overwhelming force of 1.5 million troops backed by tactical aircraft in the sky and mobile armor on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeptember 2: Poland pleads for assistance from sworn allies Britain and France. They respond the following day by demanding Nazi Germany's withdrawal and declaring war against the Nazi regime. India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (and soon South Africa) issue their own declarations of war.\n\nSeptember 3: Conservative parliamentarian Winston Churchill is named first lord of the admiralty.\n\nBritain's Royal Air Force (RAF) carries out the first propaganda air raid of the war, salting northern Germany with six million pamphlets.\n\nWithout warning, a German U-boat torpedoes the Athenia, a British passenger ship carrying 1,400 civilians from England to Canada, killing 118.\n\nSeptember 4: The first RAF air assault is a disaster, with only eight of 29 bombers striking German naval bases. Ten of the RAF bombers get lost, seven are shot down, three attack one of Britain's own ships, and one attacks neutral Denmark.\n\nSpain's General Francisco Franco offers his support to the Axis while publicly declaring neutrality.\n\nSeptember 5: The Nazis occupy the medieval Polish city of Kraków.\n\nThe United States officially declares its neutrality.\n\nSeptember 6: RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires that scramble during a false air raid alert end up shooting at each other, with the Spitfires downing the Hurricanes.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more images and headlines from World War II that examine the details of Nazi Germany's aggression in early September, 1939.\n\nJunkers Ju-87 (Stukas) vital to success of Blitzkrieg: Close air support was a prerequisite for the success of the Wehrmacht's Blitzkrieg operations. In 1939 and early 1940, the gull-winged, single-engine Junkers Ju-87 (Stuka) -- with three machine guns and a maximum bomb load of 1,540 pounds -- was vital to such operations. The terror sirens of these diving aircraft struck fear into those on the ground below, while their bombs and guns amplified this terror with death and destruction. However, once opposed by more modern fighter aircraft -- such as the British RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes beginning in 1940 -- the Ju-87s proved vulnerable. They were subsquently utilized only occasionally in support of front-line offensive operations.\n\nGerman general Fedor von Bock tops in the field: German general Fedor von Bock was a distinguished old-style Prussian officer who commanded the German Anschluss forces in 1938. In 1939 he commanded Army Group North during the Polish campaign and, in 1940, Army Group B during the Blitzkrieg that speedily overran the Low Countries and defeated France. Later, Bock was twice relieved of commands in Russia: first in 1941 following a failed offensive against Moscow, and subsequently in 1942 after disagreements with Adolf Hitler over operational decisions. Having survived both those campaigns and Hitler's displeasure, he was killed in an Allied air raid on May 4, 1945.\n\nPoland succumbs to German invasion: The event that finally destroyed any residual hopes in London or Paris that appeasement might yet succeed was Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland. At dawn on September 1, 1939, successive waves of bombers and fighter-bombers raided deep into Poland. Simultaneously, the tanks, artillery, and infantry of two German army groups, comprised of five separate armies, launched devastating attacks against the sizable but outdated and poorly deployed Polish forces. Warsaw finally fell on September 27, the effectiveness of Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht had been validated, and the Blitzkrieg concept of warfare was born.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNazi Germany continued its assault on Poland throughout September 1939.

The RAF loses two aircraft, while the Germans lose one.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more highlights and images from September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland.\n\nWarsaw puts up a fight against Nazi invaders: The German capture of Warsaw, Poland, seen here with its buildings burning on the horizon, proved costly for Germans and Poles alike. On September 9, the Fourth Panzer Division lost 57 of 120 tanks in early street fighting for the city, and the panzer commanders learned many hard lessons from this clash. However, after more than two weeks of intensive air bombardment and ground combat, characterized by a succession of closely coordinated ground and air assaults and artillery bombardments, the city finally fell on September 27.\n\nMurder of defenseless Poles by Nazi Germany: Kazimiera Mika, a 10-year-old Polish girl, stoops over the body of her older sister. The elder Mika girl and six other women, desperate for food, had been digging for potatoes in a field in besieged Warsaw when the Luftwaffe struck. Nazi fliers swooped down to within 200 feet of the ground and attacked the group with machine-gun fire. Two were killed. As the aircraft left, Kazimiera ran to her fallen sibling. This was Kazimiera's first experience with the finality of death, and she was unable to understand why her sister could no longer speak to her.\n\nMesserschmitt fighter bombers crucial to Blitzkrieg: Flying at 350 mph with a range of 565 miles, the German Messerschmitt Me 110 fighter-bomber accommodated a two-man crew, carried 2,000 pounds of bombs or four air-to-air rockets, and was armed with two 20mm cannons and five machine guns. The first twin-engine fighter to enter operational service during the war, the Me 110 was highly successful during the 1939 Blitzkrieg against Poland. However, it was outclassed by the RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires during the Battle of Britain in 1940, proving to be both slower and less maneuverable. It later enjoyed a renaissance as a night fighter.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 on the World War II timeline next.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn September 25, 1939, Warsaw fell to the armies of Nazi Germany, presaging Poland's ultimate surrender.

They systematically bombed and shelled the city, causing extensive destruction and loss of life. The city's own air defenses were overwhelmed by the tempo of the Luftwaffe onslaught, while the outclassed Polish air force was effectively neutralized by September 17. Much of Warsaw's industrial and commercial heart -- including its great complex of flour mills\n\n-- was set ablaze, and its system of water-pumping stations and filtration plants was extensively damaged.\n\nNazis force Jews to dig their own graves: Soon after the German victory, the SS death squads in Poland began their work of dealing with what the Nazis termed the \"Jewish question.\" These two Polish Jews are about to be murdered once they have completed digging their own graves. Such denigration contributed directly to a victim's dehumanization, and consequently to a perverse legitimization by the Nazis of such atrocities. Of the approximately six million European Jews murdered during the Holocaust, 2.9 million were Polish.\n\nThreat of attacks lead to evacuation of British children: In Great Britain's \"Pied Piper\" evacuation, nearly three million people moved from London and other cities to rural locations that were considered safe from German air attacks. Most were schoolchildren -- often from poor neighborhoods -- who had never met the families they would live with during the war. Pictured are some of the young evacuees. Some parents, including the Royal Family, kept their children in town with them as a patriotic gesture.\n\nGeneral Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt carries out Adolf Hitler's wishes: General Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt mounted the coup that destroyed the last legal government of Prussia in 1932. Despite being removed (together with other senior army officers) by Adolf Hitler in 1938 during the Blomberg-Fritsch crisis, Rundstedt was recalled to duty in August 1939 to lead the Polish invasion. He commanded Army Group South throughout that campaign. His undoubted talents as a field commander and staff officer were employed against France in 1940, and subsequently elsewhere. Rundstedt always served within or close to the high command. He was enthusiastic about the mass killing of Jews, and accepted huge bribes from Hitler.\n\nThe following page is a timeline of the important World War II events of October 1939, when Nazi Germany conquered Poland.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nA Popular War\n\n\"I have still to find a German, even among those who don't like the regime, who sees anything wrong in the German destruction of Poland.

Here, German troops assemble the Jews soon after the town's capture. During the next two years, as many as 12,000 Jews from Plonsk and the surrounding area passed through the ghetto. It was eventually emptied in November 1942 when its remaining inhabitants were consigned to Auschwitz for extermination.\n\nPolish campaign results in massive casualties: By the end of the four-week campaign in Poland, 50,000 German soldiers were dead, wounded, or missing. Polish losses amounted to some 70,000 soldiers killed and 130,000 wounded. Another 90,000 Polish soldiers escaped to Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, and Latvia; many of them later made their way to Allied lines. Initially, the Wehrmacht's treatment of its 694,000 Polish prisoners was generally appropriate, although many civilians, a large proportion of them Jewish, were murdered. The SS and Sicherheitsdienst (German secret service, or SD) soon established themselves in Nazi German-occupied Poland, which was now regarded as a \"nonexistent\" state. Thereafter, the civilian population, especially Jews, suffered increasing oppression and persecution.\n\nOn the next page you'll find a World War II timeline highlighting the important events of November and December 1939, when the Soviet Union invaded Finland.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Waffen-SS\n\nThe Waffen-SS (Armed SS) evolved directly from the three original SS-Verfügungstruppe (Emergency Force) regiments -- Deutschland, Germania, and Der Führer -- within the Allgemeine-SS (General-SS). Many of the elite Waffen-SS units that were created attracted widespread notoriety. Warriors fought with a dedication, professionalism, loyalty, cruelty, and self-sacrifice that stemmed directly from their commitment to Nazi ideology and an absolute belief in Adolf Hitler.\n\nAmong the better known of the 39 Waffen-SS divisions (all of which had nationalistic or Teutonic titles) were Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, Das Reich, Totenkopf, Wiking, Prinz Eugen, Hohenstaufen, Nordland, and Hitlerjugend. Generally, the Waffen-SS divisions had some of the best weapons and equipment available, and their achievements in combat were regularly prodigious. Their ideological faith in the Nazi cause and its political imperatives led various Waffen-SS units to commit a litany of atrocities and war crimes against military personnel and civilians alike -- especially on the Eastern Front.\n\nRecruitment for the Waffen-SS was initially voluntary, with superlative fitness, Aryan antecedents, and NSDAP membership the basic prerequisites for all applicants. However, as the war continued, groups such as the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) were increasingly pressuring recruits into \"volunteering.\" Similarly, fitness requirements were relaxed over time -- notwithstanding an often harsh training regimen that demanded unquestioning obedience, was physically rigorous, and routinely included exercises that utilized live ammunition.\n\nFrom 1941 on, the Waffen-SS was expanded significantly to enable the raising of \"foreign legions.\" Heinrich Himmler depicted this as the creation of a \"European army\" to fight the \"great crusade against Bolshevism.\" These foreign units varied widely in quality and were recruited from countries as diverse as Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Croatia, Norway, Denmark, Holland, France, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Galicia, Albania, Finland, and India. A 60-strong Britisches Freikorps was even recruited from disaffected British POWs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November and December of 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Finland and Nazi Germany accelerated its persecution of the Jews.

During the war with Japan, Chiang and his third wife, \"Madame Chiang,\" were viewed in the West as symbols of Chinese democracy and heroic resistance to Japanese aggression. Yet Chiang, who faced civil war with the Chinese Communists, was neither pro-democracy nor eager to fight the Japanese. He hoped to rebuild and modernize China, and came to be its key military leader after July 1937. His stature at home declined due to rampant corruption in his government. Following the war, the Communists succeeded in driving Chiang from the mainland. He withdrew his government to Taiwan, where he died in 1975.\n\nNazi Germany defines \"degenerate music\": In 1938 the Third Reich's respected \"culture, art, and theater specialist,\" Hans Severus Ziegler, organized an exhibition called Entartete Musik (Degenerate Music). The poster seen here -- with its stereotypical Negro playing jazz while wearing a Star of David on his lapel -- crams as many symbols of supposed cultural decay as possible into a single image. The avant-garde music of modern composers, such as Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith, was regarded as especially pernicious and un-Germanic by Nazi cultural authorities. Of course, if a composer had so much as one Jewish grandparent, any music he chose to write was labeled \"degenerate.\"\n\nKeep reading to learn more about Nazi military operations in Europe at the beginning of World War II.

Under the program Aktion T4, doctors could identify individuals as unsound and incurable, then put them to death. Neither patient nor family consent was required. Based on Nazi concepts of \"racial hygiene\" and supported by a desire to limit the costs of patient care, T4 systematically destroyed as many as 100,000 human beings. It was another demonstration of Nazi policies designed to eliminate those they considered unworthy of life.\n\nU.S. ends arms embargo: President Franklin Roosevelt addresses the American people via radio in the fall of 1939. Beginning in 1935, a series of American neutrality acts and extensions banned arms shipments, loans, and other aid to belligerent countries, including Great Britain. Roosevelt came to regret signing the 1935 act. On September 21, 1939, he urged an end to the arms embargo. In November, Congress repealed the embargo and passed a \"cash and carry\" policy for Allied purchases, though other bans remained in effect.\n\nNazi Germany destroys the HMS Royal Oak: The HMS Royal Oak was one of five British Revenge-class WWI ships that were refitted for WWII. These relatively small battleships featured a \"torpedo bulge\" of protective armor. Even so, on October 14, 1939, the anchored battleship sank when the German submarine U-47 slipped through British naval base defenses at Scapa Flow and struck with four torpedoes. The Royal Oak became the first major British ship to be destroyed in World War II. More than 800 crew members perished.\n\nClick next for a World War II timeline detailing the events of January and February, 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nNazi Euthanasia Program\n\n\"The idea is unbearable to me that the best, the flower of our youth must lose its life at the front in order that feebleminded and irresponsible asocial elements can have a secure existence in the asylum.\"\n\n-- Dr. Hermann Pfannmüller, a strong advocate of the Nazi\n\n\"euthanasia\" program\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs January 1940 ended, Nazi Germany increased its attacks on Britain and the Soviet Union marched toward victory in Finland.

The Führer ended his speech earlier than expected. Minutes after he left the hall, an explosion buried the speaking platform under debris. Johann Georg Elser, a carpenter, had set the timer and planted the bomb. Elser was arrested and later executed. From 1939 to 1945, at least 17 other attempts to assassinate Hitler were made. Most were planned by officers who despised his military policies.\n\nOn the following page you'll find a World War II timeline detailing the events of February, 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Russo-Finnish War\n\nBy the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, Finland was assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence. That October, Stalin demanded that the Finns cede to him the Karelian Isthmus (north of Leningrad) and the city of Hangö (at the mouth of the Baltic). Though offered Soviet territory in Karelia in return, Finland refused. Stalin then disavowed the Soviet-Finnish nonaggression treaty and planned to incorporate Finland into the USSR by force. He established a Communist government for Finland, but abandoned it when Finnish resistance made its establishment in Helsinki too difficult.\n\nThe Red Army's initial performance was courageous but inept. Soviets outnumbered Finns about four to one at the front, but the fieldworks and bunkers of the Mannerheim Line (named after Marshal Mannerheim, the Finnish commander) proved too strong. The Finns submerged political and social divisions for the national good. As many as 125,000 Soviet troops were killed in four months of fighting, which revealed deficiencies in training, equipment, supplies, tactics, and a leadership decimated by Stalin's purges. The Finnish army was also ill-equipped, but its men were well trained and highly motivated, and its snipers and ski troops inflicted heavy casualties.\n\nThe arrival of Marshal Timoshenko, 27 new divisions, and armored support enabled the Soviets to breach the Mannerheim Line on February 11, 1940. Not long after, the Finns accepted a Soviet peace offer, which was formalized in the Peace of Moscow on March 12. Finland had to surrender the territory demanded in October 1939, although it was allowed to keep its independence and most of the Finnish territory in the north occupied by the Red Army during hostilities.\n\nFor its aggression in this \"Winter War,\" the USSR was expelled from the League of Nations. Kliment Voroshilov, Stalin's old crony, was dismissed as defense commissar for his complacency and incompetence in the campaign. Timoshenko, his replacement, introduced urgently needed reforms. In Finland, bitterness at the Peace of Moscow contributed to the nation's decision to join Germany's Operation Barbarossa in 1941.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe severe winter of 1940 coupled with the attacks by Nazi Germany in Europe led to rationing in Britain and across the continent. Below is a World War II timeline tracing major events from February 1940.\n\nWorld War II Timeline: February 12-February 29\n\nFebruary 12: With paper in short supply, Britain adds it to the growing list of commodities subject to rationing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 14: Not immune to the troubles in the rest of Europe, the Vatican institutes a rationing program.\n\nFebruary 15: One day after Britain declares it is outfitting its merchant vessels with guns, Nazi Germany announces that it will henceforth treat all British merchant ships as hostile combatants.\n\nFebruary 16: After an exhaustive search, the British Navy locates, detains, and boards the German ship Altmark in Norwegian waters. The Nazis had been using Altmark as a prison ship, and the boarding party quickly secures the release of 299 British prisoners taken by Germans from Allied ships.\n\nFebruary 17: Despite the danger of a defeat of Finland by the Soviet Union, the Finns' request for aid from their supposed ally Sweden is rebuffed.\n\nFebruary 18: The \"moral embargo,\" America's refusal to deal with imperialist belligerents in Europe, is extended to the Soviet Union.\n\nFebruary 27: In an effort to boost morale, Winston Churchill wildly overstates Britain's success on the seas, claiming that half of Nazi Germany's feared U-boats have been sunk by the Allies.\n\nFebruary 28: Parts of the Enigma cipher machine are recovered from the wreckage of a German U-boat, adding to the Polish-supplied information on the Enigma puzzle in the hands of the Allies.\n\nFebruary 29: Food and gas rationing begins in France.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more World War II highlights and images about the Allied response to Nazi Germany's aggression in February of 1940.\n\nThe War Illustrated chronicles the war: In September 1939, British citizens saw the rebirth of The War Illustrated, a magazine that had been popular during WWI. Promising to publish a photographic record of the \"Second Great War\" as it happened, the magazine covered both the war and the home front. Issue 5 featured photos showing U.S. reactions to the Nazi invasion of Poland. Issue 13 (pictured) shows an underground sentry from a Scottish regiment keeping watch through a periscope.\n\nCanada commits to the war effort: Men of the First Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force wait to disembark at a British port in February 1940. Originally, Canada supported appeasement of the Nazi regime. However, soon after Nazi Germany invaded Poland, the Canadian Parliament approved entry into the war. Canada began sending troops to Britain in December 1939, although those men did not see action for several years. Starting with a small military, Canada raised substantial armed forces and had one of the world's largest militaries by war's end.\n\nEgypt lets Britain do the fighting: Although independent since 1922, Egypt still depended upon Britain to defend its land and the Suez Canal. In 1939-1940, anti-British and pro-Axis sentiments were widespread, so British forces occupied Egypt in strength. Meanwhile, the embryonic Egyptian army of 11 infantry battalions (pictured) and two other regiments was of little military significance. Even when Italy invaded Egypt in September 1940, its government declared nonbelligerent status, leaving the British to eject the invaders.\n\nKeep reading to see a World War II timeline detailing important events from March 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 1940 brought major developments in World War II, including Adolf Hitler outlining his plan to invade Norway and Denmark. Below is a World War II timeline tracing this and other important events of March 1940.\n\nWorld War II Timeline: March 1-March 14\n\nMarch: According to the BBC, two out of three British citizens listen to \"Lord Haw-Haw,\" the \"omniscient,\" traitorous announcer of the German propaganda radio show Germany Calling.\n\nMarch 1: Facing shortages of darker dyes for servicemen's uniforms, British women are asked to wear only light-colored clothing.\n\nAdolf Hitler orders his generals to create a plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark.\n\nMarch 2: The Allies ask Sweden and Norway for the right to cross their territory for the purpose of sending troops to reinforce a flagging Finnish force, but are refused.\n\nMarch 6: A delegation leaves Helsinki for Moscow to negotiate the terms of Finland's surrender to the Soviets.\n\nMarch 7: The Queen Elizabeth, the new flagship of Cunard's luxury liner fleet, arrives in New York at the end of a daring high-speed crossing of the German U-boat-infested Atlantic.\n\nMarch 9: A belated offer of troops and material support from the Allies is relayed to Helsinki.\n\nMarch 11: The United States has relaxed its arms embargo for its once and future allies, selling several P-40 fighters to Britain and France.\n\nMarch 12: Marched for some 18 hours in a blizzard, 72 of 1,000 German Jewish deportees succumb to the elements in Lublin, Poland.\n\nThe Soviet Union and Finland sign a peace treaty in which Finland surrenders substantial strategic territory, including the city of Viipuri and the port of Hangö. The new order comes at a cost of some 25,000 Finnish lives and the deaths of nearly 70,000 Soviets.\n\nMarch 14: Some half-million Finns pour out of the Soviet-occupied territory shortly after the cessation of hostilities.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more images and headlines detailing events from World War II in March 1940.\n\nBritain and Australia ally to fight Japan: This piece of Allied propaganda, which emphasizes a cooperative effort against Japan by Australian and British forces, is not entirely accurate. Australia entered the war against Germany in 1939, sending troops to the Middle East in accordance with British strategy. Volunteer Australian soldiers proved to be top-notch, despite the impact of prewar monetary cuts on military preparedness. However, Australian strategy changed with Japan's entry into the war in 1941 and the potential invasion of Australia itself. Preoccupied with the German threat, Britain was not able to guarantee support, and Australia turned to the United States instead.\n\nOn March 18, 1940, Adolf Hitler met with Benito Mussolini to discuss Italy joining the war. This and other events from March of 1940 are discussed on the World War II timeline next.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nSweden's \"Neutrality\" in World War II\n\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Sweden declared its neutrality as it had in every European conflict since 1814. Swedes opened their doors to those at risk of capture and imprisonment by Nazis. They sheltered almost 8,000 Jewish refugees in 1943, protected 44,000 Norwegians fleeing from German occupation, and sent one of the true heroes of the war, Raoul Wallenberg, to Hungary to save the lives of thousands of Jews. While Swedish citizens took pride in their humanitarian efforts, most of them did not know that their government was also providing important resources to the Nazis.\n\nSweden remained neutral when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway in April 1940, and the nation resisted Germany's request to allow its troops to travel along the Swedish railroad. However, this resolve weakened as the war progressed and when it looked like no nation could stop the Nazi conquest. The Swedish government permitted German troops to travel its railroads to Norway in June 1940, and to transport a whole division from Norway to Finland for its invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nSwedish cooperation with the Nazis did not end with transportation. The Swedes supplied Germany with about 30 percent of the iron ore the Germans used to manufacture weapons. Sweden also provided credit to the Germans, who repaid their debt with gold, including 13 tons of gold that the Nazis had stolen from Belgium and the Netherlands. Sweden's support continued until it became apparent that an Allied victory was inevitable.\n\nMarch 1940 proved significant in World War II as Adolf Hitler met with Benito Mussolini on March 18 to discuss Italy's potential involvement in the war. This and other important events are detailed in the World War II timeline below.\n\nWorld War II Timeline: March 14-March 30\n\nMarch 14: The Polish government, operating in exile in France, reveals that Adolf Hitler attempted to persuade Poland to join him in an invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nNazi Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring orders all German citizens to surrender any metal that may be recycled into war material.\n\nJapan's new Zero fighter planes prove formidable when 12 return from an encounter with Chinese fighters over Chengtu, having destroyed 27 of 30 Chinese planes with no casualties of their own.\n\nMarch 16: James Isbister, of the Scottish village Bridge of Waithe, becomes the first United Kingdom civilian killed in an air raid since the First World War.\n\nMarch 18: Adolf Hitler meets with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to discuss Italy's entry into the war. It is determined that Mussolini's troops will attack France.\n\nMarch 19: Avenging Nazi Germany's March 16 attack on Scapa Flow, 50 British Royal Air Force bombers attack a seaplane base at Sylt, a German island in the North Sea.\n\nMarch 20: Finance Minister Paul Reynaud succeeds Édouard Daladier as prime minister of France.\n\nHaving failed in his bid to convince Europe's belligerents to lay down their weapons, U.S. Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles departs Genoa, Italy, for his return voyage to the United States.\n\nMarch 27: As diplomatic relations between the Allies and the Soviet Union become difficult because of Soviet aid to Germany, Paris requests the removal of the Soviet ambassador.\n\nMarch 28: Britain and France agree to not act independently in establishing treaties with any third nation.\n\nMarch 30: Japan establishes a Chinese puppet government in Nanking, which the United States refuses to recognize.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more images and headlines about World War II, Nazi Germany, and the Allied forces.\n\nTheodor Eicke appointed head of concentration camps: Theodor Eicke joined the NSDAP (the Nazi party) in 1928. As the Nazis rose to power, Eicke was appointed commandant of the Dachau camp in 1933. His brutal actions there impressed Heinrich Himmler so much that he was appointed inspector of concentration camps and SS guard formations in 1934. From 1939 until his death in combat in 1943, Eicke commanded the Waffen-SS Totenkopf (\"Death's Head\") division in the Polish, French, and Russian campaigns. The Totenkopf division committed numerous atrocities, such as machine-gunning 99 British soldiers who had surrendered to them at Dunkirk.\n\nNorwegian officer Vidkun Quisling collaborates with Nazis: Vidkun Quisling (left), the man whose very name came to mean \"traitorous collaborator,\" rides with SS head Heinrich Himmler, likely during Quisling's visit to see Adolf Hitler in December 1939. Quisling was a Norwegian military officer who helped form a Fascist political party in 1933, with himself as Fører (leader, comparable to Führer). When Germany invaded Norway in April 1940, Quisling made a radio news announcement declaring himself prime minister on behalf of the Nazis. Five days later, the Nazis threw Quisling out of power. However, in need of a Norwegian puppet, they reinstated him in 1942. After the war, Vidkun Quisling was convicted of treason and executed.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nCONTRIBUTING WRITERS:\n\nJohn S. D. Eisenhower, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Richard Overy Ph.D., David J. A. Stone, Wim Coleman, Martin F. Graham, James H. Hallas, Mark Johnston Ph.D., Christy Nadalin M.A., Pat Perrin, Peter Stanley Ph.D.\n\nNazi Aesthetics\n\nDuring Hitler's reign, paintings featured idealized images of a strong, peaceful, and pastoral Germany; of the Teutonic chivalry and military heroism of former times; and of the myths and legends of the Rhine. These concepts were fused with the physical strength, athleticism, and beauty thought to be exemplified by the Aryan man and woman, frequently pictured nude. Such emotive imagery generated sentiments and reactions ranging from selfless patriotism to blatant anti-Semitism and racism, from national pride to rampant militarism. Simplicity, realism, and heroism superseded all forms of modernism, such as impressionism, cubism, and Dada. Similar standards applied to German sculpture as well as to the architectural designs developed by Albert Speer for the grandiose new buildings of the Reich's capital.\n\nThe art that depicted \"the true Germanic spirit\" was set against the Entartete Kunst (degenerate art) of \"lesser\" cultures and peoples. The contrast reinforced the Nazi political and racist philosophy while simultaneously emphasizing Germany's heroic heritage. Nazi artwork contributed to the pageantry and martial spectacle for such events as the Nuremberg rallies of the 1930s.\n\nIn 1936 a German tribunal was established to purge the country of all Entartete Kunst. However, the Nazis' declared abhorrence of such works did not prevent them from looting many examples of it from the major galleries and museums of occupied Europe. More than 5,000 paintings -- including many by Goya, Rembrandt, and Rubens -- were transported to Germany along with thousands of other works of art. Hermann Göring and other senior Nazi officials accumulated personal art collections of immense value. While many of these items were recovered after the war, it was difficult to determine ownership and provenance. Disputes continued into the 21st century."
