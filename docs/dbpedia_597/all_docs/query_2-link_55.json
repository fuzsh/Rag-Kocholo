June 6, 1944, the latter is convinced that the landing in Normandy is a diversion and gives no order of movement towards Calvados.\n\nThe 15th Army is waiting for a hypothetical landing in the Pas-de-Calais which does not take place and it is sent to Lower Normandy at the end of August, when the Allies can no longer be pushed back to the sea. the consequences of the inactivity of his army during the two months of battle in Normandy, Hans von Salmuth was deprived of his command, especially since he was in contact with the officers plotting against the Führer.\n\nAt the end of the war, he was taken prisoner and tried at the Nuremberg trial. Sentenced in 1948 to twenty years in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity, he was finally liberated in 1953. He died in 1962 in Heidelberg and is buried in Wiesbaden."
