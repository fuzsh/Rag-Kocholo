        "text": "Leeb, Bock, and Rundstedt were competent and even somewhat solid (Rundstedt's contribution in the Ukraine in September 1941 was quite good, but he was lacking aside from that), but nothing exceptional or enterprising. They were part of the Old Prussian Guard, who were often like that. Then you have the likes of Manstein (also Prussian but not quite old guard), who was more enterprising and good at operations and maneuver but who was a distinctly inferior fighting general to the likes of Model (excellent fighting general but poor strategist) or almost any of their main Soviet opponents from late 1942 onwards. Kesselring was also better in that regard. It seems to me that Manstein was excellent at staff planning or when in command of an Army (see his planning for France in 1940 or his Crimean campaign in '42) but more often than not was lackluster when commanding an Army Group. This was seen first by his inability to really punch through to Paulus in Stalingrad, as well as being largely bested by Vatutin and Konev from Kursk onwards. Lastly, you have the 'armored' generals such as Guderian, Rommel, and Kleist. They were skillful and enterprising as lower-level armor commanders but considerably less able in higher command and particularly lacking in strategic judgment.\n\nvon Manstein did reach within 50 miles of the encircled German troops but Paulus didnt make any effort to break out..as for his defeats after kursk...his soldiers were outnumbered 3 or 4 to 1 in every battle added to the fact that Hitler kept interfering in littlest of matters.\n\nas for Bock, i would rank him among the top 3 German commandersin the war. Its unfortunate that he was killed without producing 'best selling' memoirs like Manstein, or the West couldn't use him as a bogeyman like they do with Rommel.\n\nvon Manstein did reach within 50 miles of the encircled German troops but Paulus didnt make any effort to break out..as for his defeats after kursk...his soldiers were outnumbered 3 or 4 to 1 in every battle added to the fact that Hitler kept interfering in littlest of matters.\n\nas for Bock, i would rank him among the top 3 German commandersin the war. Its unfortunate that he was killed without producing 'best selling' memoirs like Manstein, or the West couldn't use him as a bogeyman like they do with Rommel.\n\nA fair point regarding the inability to break through to Kursk. I remain skeptical of just how outnumbered the Germans truly were in some of these engagements, as well as the comparative losses. For example, I have seen a number of more traditional sources saying that the Russians suffered heavier at their victory at Kursk and more recent sources saying the Germans suffered more. I tend to believe the recent ones more because the Germans were the ones attacking here. It's those traditional sources which also tend to emphasize Hitlers interference while downplaying questionable performances on the part of German generals, which, while highly competent much of the time, are worthy of censure on other occasions. Hitler's interference at Stalingrad was quite foolish, as well as before Operation Bagration (misguidedly being encouraged by Model, in one of his few poor judgment calls). Otherwise, there were times when Hitler and Model's calls for gritty resistance and good fighting were more correct than Manstein's wishes to continuously launch either short-term lightning strikes or maneuver around his problems. Manstein, while a superior offensive general, was not as good on the defense as Model, and vice-versa.\n\nWhile ill admit that Bock was more skillful than Leeb, he still always struck me as rather unimaginative and unexceptional in comparison to the likes of Manstein, Guderian, Model, Kesselring, and Rommel (though any of these were probably better strategists than Rommel). He didn't seem to be one to adapt well when initial plans went awry."
