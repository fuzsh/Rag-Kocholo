Its rear area operations were organized by the Army Group North Rear Area.\n\nThe first Army Group North was deployed during the Invasion of Poland and subsequently renamed Army Group B. The second Army Group North was created on 22 June 1941 from the former Army Group C and used in the northern sector of the Eastern Front from 1941 to January 1945. By then, this second Army Group North had gotten trapped in the Courland Pocket and was accordingly redesignated Army Group Courland. On the same day, the former Army Group Center, which was now defending the northernmost sector of the contiguous Eastern Front, was renamed Army Group North, assuming the status of the third and final iteration of the army group.\n\nThe staff of Army Group North was formally assembled on 2 September 1939 from the headquarters of 2nd Army,[2] which in turn had been activated just a few days prior, on 26 August.[3] Fedor von Bock, commanding general of 2nd Army, became the first commanding general of Army Group North.[2]\n\nDuring the Invasion of Poland, Army Group North had two armies placed under its supervision: 3rd Army (Georg von Küchler) and 4th Army (Günther von Kluge). Additionally, it held four divisions as part of its army group reserves: 10th Panzer Division, 73rd Infantry Division, 206th Infantry Division and 208th Infantry Division.[4]\n\nOn the morning of 1 September 1939, 3rd Army began its advance from East Prussia southwards towards central Poland, whereas 4th Army attacked from Pomerania into the Danzig Corridor.\n\nImportant battles by the 3rd Army during the Polish campaign included the Battle of Grudziądz, the Battle of Mława, the Battle of Różan, the Battle of Łomża, the Battle of Wizna and the Battle of Brześć Litewski.[5] Important battles of the 4th Army included the Battle of Tuchola Forest, the Battle of Westerplatte, the Battle of Hel and the Battle of Gdynia.[6]\n\nOrder of battle, 1 September 1939[5][6] Army Group Army Corps Division Army Group North (Fedor von Bock) 3rd Army (Georg von Küchler) XXI Army Corps (Nikolaus von Falkenhorst) 228th Infantry Division (Hans Suttner) 21st Infantry Division (Kuno-Hans von Both) I Army Corps (Walter Petzel) 11th Infantry Division (Max Bock) 61st Infantry Division (Siegfried Haenicke) Panzer Division Kempf (Werner Kempf) Corps Wodrig (Albert Wodrig) 1st Infantry Division (Joachim von Kortzfleisch) 12th Infantry Division (Ludwig von der Leyen) Group Brand (Fritz Brand) Lötzen Infantry Brigade (Otto-Ernst Ottenbacher) Goldap Infantry Brigade (Notle) Army reserves 217th Infantry Division (Richard Baltzer) Grenzschutz-Abschnittskommando 15 4th Army (Günther von Kluge) XIX Army Corps (Heinz Guderian) 2nd Infantry Division (Paul Bader) 20th Infantry Division (Mauritz von Wiktorin) 3rd Panzer Division (Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg) II Army Corps (Adolf Strauß) 3rd Infantry Division (Walter Lichel) 32nd Infantry Division (Franz Böhme) III Army Corps (Curt Haase) 50th Infantry Division (Konrad Sorsche) Brigade Netze Associated border guards Grenzschutz-Abschnittskommando 1 Grenzschutz-Abschnittskommando 2 Grenzschutz-Abschnittskommando 12 Army reserves 23rd Infantry Division (Walter Graf von Brockdorff-Ahlefeldt) 218th Infantry Division (Woldemar Freiherr von Grote) Army Group reserves 10th Panzer Division (Ferdinand Schaal) 73rd Infantry Division (Friedrich von Rabenau) 206th Infantry Division (Hugo Höfl) 208th Infantry Division (Moritz Andreas)\n\nIn preparation for Operation Barbarossa, Army Group North was reformed from Army Group C on 22 June 1941. Army Group North was commanded by Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb[7] and staged in East Prussia. Its strategic goal was Leningrad, with operational objectives being the territories of the Baltic republics and securing the northern flank of Army Group Centre in Northern Russia between Western Dvina River and Daugavpils-Kholm Army Group boundary. On commencement of the Wehrmacht's Baltic offensive operation the army group deployed into Lithuania and northern Belorussia. It served mainly in Baltic territories and north Russia until 1944. Commander in Chief 22 June 1941: Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb.\n\nIts subordinate armies were deployed with the following immediate objectives:\n\n18th Army - from Koenigsberg to Ventspils - Jelgava\n\n4th Panzer Group - Pskov\n\n16th Army - Kaunas, Daugavpils\n\nArmy Group troops\n\nArmy-Group signals regiment 537\n\nArmy-Group signals regiment 639 (2nd echelon)\n\nAll operational objectives such as Tallinn were achieved despite stubborn Red Army resistance and several unsuccessful counter-offensives such as the Battle of Raseiniai, and the army group approached Leningrad, commencing the Siege of Leningrad. However, while the Baltic states were overrun, the Siege of Leningrad continued until 1944, when it was lifted as a result of the Red Army Leningrad-Novgorod strategic offensive operation.\n\nIn September 1941, the Spanish Blue Division was assigned to Army Group North.\n\nComposition:\n\nOctober 1941\n\n16th Army\n\n18th Army\n\nNevsky Pyatachok\n\nOperation Nordlicht\n\nCommander in Chief 17 January 1942: GFM Georg von Küchler\n\nComposition:\n\nSeptember 1942\n\n11th Army\n\n16th Army\n\n18th Army\n\nDecember 1942\n\n16th Army\n\n18th Army\n\nDemyansk Pocket\n\nKholm Pocket\n\nSoviet Toropets-Kholm Operation\n\nBattle of Velikiye Luki\n\nBattle of Krasny Bor\n\nCommander in Chief 9 January 1944: Field marshal Walter Model\n\nCommander in Chief 31 March 1944: Generaloberst Georg Lindemann\n\nCommander in Chief 4 July 1944: Generaloberst Johannes Frießner\n\nCommander in Chief 23 July 1944: GFM Ferdinand Schörner\n\nMarch 1944\n\nArmy detachment \"Narwa\"\n\n16th Army\n\n18th Army\n\nBattle of Narva, consisting of:\n\nBattle for Narva Bridgehead and\n\nBattle of Tannenberg Line\n\nCombat in South Estonia, 1944\n\nSoviet Baltic Offensive\n\nBattle of Porkuni\n\nBattle of Vilnius (1944)\n\nBattle of Memel\n\nAfter becoming trapped in the Courland Cauldron after 25 January 1945, the Army Group was renamed Army Group Courland. On the same day, in East Prussia, a new Army Group North was created by renaming Army Group Center. On the 2 April 1945, the army group was dissolved, and the staff formed the 12th Army headquarters.\n\nArmy Group North (old Army Group Centre), was driven into an ever smaller pocket around Königsberg in East Prussia. On April 9, 1945 Königsberg finally fell to the Red Army, although remnants of Army Group units continued to resist on the Heiligenbeil & Danzig beachheads until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nOctober 1944\n\n16th Army\n\nArmee-Abteilung Grasser\n\n18th Army\n\nNovember 1944\n\n16th Army\n\nArmee-Abteilung Kleffel\n\n18 Armee\n\nDecember 1944\n\n16th Army\n\n18th Army\n\nSoviet East Prussian Offensive\n\nBattle of Königsberg\n\nHeiligenbeil pocket\n\nCommander in Chief 27 January 1945: Generaloberst Dr. Lothar Rendulic\n\nCommander in Chief 12 March 1945: Walter Weiß\n\nComposition:\n\nFebruary 1945\n\nArmee-Abteilung Samland\n\n4th Army\n\nSoviet East Pomeranian Offensive\n\nBattle of Kolberg\n\nCourland Pocket\n\nOn the 25 January 1945 Hitler renamed three army groups. Army Group North became Army Group Courland, more appropriate as it had been isolated from Army Group Centre and was trapped in Courland, Latvia; Army Group Centre became Army Group North and Army Group A became Army Group Centre.\n\nBetween January and February 1945, Army Group North sustained 213,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, 126,000 wounded, and 57,000 missing.[8]: 559\n\nNo. Portrait Commander Took office Left office Time in office 1Bock, FedorGeneralfeldmarschall\n\nFedor von Bock\n\n(1880–1945)27 August 193920 June 1941 1 year, 297 days 2Leeb, WilhelmGeneralfeldmarschall\n\nWilhelm Ritter von Leeb\n\n(1876–1956)20 June 194117 January 1942 211 days 3Küchler, GeorgGeneralfeldmarschall\n\nGeorg von Küchler\n\n(1881–1968)17 January 19429 January 1944 1 year, 357 days 4Model, WalterGeneralfeldmarschall\n\nWalter Model\n\n(1891–1945)9 January 194431 March 1944 82 days 5Lindemann, GeorgGeneraloberst\n\nGeorg Lindemann\n\n(1884–1963)31 March 19444 July 1944 95 days 6Frießner, JohannesGeneraloberst\n\nJohannes Frießner\n\n(1892–1971)4 July 194423 July 1944 19 days 7Schörner, FerdinandGeneralfeldmarschall\n\nFerdinand Schörner\n\n(1892–1973)23 July 194427 January 1945 188 days 8Rendulic, LotharGeneraloberst\n\nLothar Rendulic\n\n(1887–1971)27 January 194512 March 1945 44 days 9Weiß, WalterGeneraloberst\n\nWalter Weiß\n\n(1890–1967)12 March 19452 April 1945 21 days\n\nArmy Group South\n\nArmy Group Centre\n\nGerman order of battle for Operation Fall Weiss\n\nPolice Regiment North"
