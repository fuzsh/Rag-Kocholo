        "text": "Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff was a man with a mission. But I suppose that, for a Colonel in the German Army, having “a mission” was pretty obvious, especially in the spring of 1943. Hitler’s forces had just suffered devastating defeat along the Volga, and things were not going well in the African desert. So there were plans to make, and troops to move, and battles to fight (and from this point on, mostly battles to lose).\n\nBut this specific mission was different. For von Gersdorff, it was life-changing. In fact, it was life-ending.\n\nYou see, von Gersdorff was a conspirator. He was one of many involved in the numerous plots to assassinate Der Fuhrer. Officially, he was an intelligence officer in the Abwehr and part of Army Group Center, having been transferred there for the start of Operation Barbarossa. Army Group Center was commanded by another conspirator, Field Marshal Fedor von Bock. One of von Bock’s officers was Lt. Fabian von Schlabrendorff, yet another conspirator who happened to be von Gersdorff’s cousin…you now see how Gersdorff ended up where he did.\n\nThese men, who correctly believed that Hitler was leading the nation to humiliation and defeat, had put together several plans to either arrest or kill Adolf Hitler. To this point, none of them had succeeded.\n\nOn March 21, 1943 (which happened to be Germany’s Memorial Day to those killed in WWI), they tried again. Each year, the German leader attended a memorial service. But rather than arrest him or – what was tried on other occasions – place a bomb where Hitler would be, it was decided to carry the bombs right to the man. Von Gersdorff volunteered to a suicide mission. He placed bombs, each with a ten-minute fuse, in his pockets. During Hitler’s stroll among the memorials, von Gersdorff would get close and detonate the bombs.\n\nIt was a good plan, until he arrived at the museum. He got near Hitler, started the fuses, and waited for the bang. Unfortunately, the German dictator was in a tremendous hurry and stayed at the museum for just eight minutes before being whisked off. With the opportunity gone, and not wishing to blow himself to smithereens for nothing, Von Gersdorff quickly excused himself to the restroom, where he worked feverishly and successfully defused the bombs.\n\nFreiherr von Gersdorff escaped detection and arrest. But even more miraculous than that, he was not implicated in the famous July 20 assassination plot, which nearly succeeded. His role in that attempt was to hide the explosives that Count von Stauffenberg eventually carried in his briefcase.\n\nOne other interesting note about Col. von Gersdorff. Less than one month after he successfully defused the bombs in his pockets, he discovered the remnants of the Russian massacres in the Katyn Forest.\n\nRecommended Reading: Valkyrie: An Insider’s Account of the Plot to Kill Hitler\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nOn June 29, 1941, Minsk was taken by the Germans. The capital of Belarus was a major victory for the Wehrmacht, made all the more remarkable by the circumstances surrounding its capture.\n\nOperation Barbarossa had begun just eight days before, and Army Group Centre had set off with Moscow as its ultimate goal. Field Marshal Fedor von Bock had at his disposal nearly 50 divisions, including 9 Panzer armored divisions. And when the starting gun sounded, they got right to work against Red Army General Dmitry Pavlov’s 45 divisions comprising the Western Front.\n\nRipping to the east, tank master General Heinz Guderian’s forces and General Hermann Hoth’s forces had, by the 27th, linked up east of Minsk and cut off any Russian escape. In five days, the Panzers had covered an astounding 200 miles and encircled Minsk. Meanwhile, back west, the 4th and 9th German armies linked up east of Bialystok on the 28th. If you go to a map and find the cities of Bialystok and Minsk (like maybe here) and draw a circle around each, you’ll see what the Germans accomplished in six days…pretty incredible.\n\nThe Russian Western Front was, in the space of a week, reduced to almost nothing. What had begun as a force of 675,000 men had been chopped by nearly two-thirds…more than 60%. More than 285,000 Red Army soldiers were captured, with the remaining 135,000 or so killed in action. It was a humiliating loss for the Russians, but for General Pavlov, it was worse. As Bialystok was encircled, he was stripped of his command. The day after Minsk fell, Pavlov (along with his staff) was stripped of his life.\n\nDespite the rapid movement, there were already concerns high in the German ranks, whispers that the advance was not quick enough, and the forward elements were being bogged down. But to anyone looking on from the outside, it appeared that a Russian defeat was not only inevitable, it was imminent.\n\nRecommended Reading: The Eastern Front – Day By Day, 1941-45\n\nRead Full Post »"
