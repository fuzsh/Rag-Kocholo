        "text": "The Polish Corridor, also known as the Danzig Corridor, was a strip of land that was established after World War I to connect the newly independent Poland with the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe corridor, which was approximately 100 miles long and 20 miles wide, passed through the territory of the former German province of Pomerania and included the city of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland).\n\nThe German population living in the Polish Corridor experienced a significant exodus during the 1920s and 1930s. The exact number of Germans who left the area is difficult to determine, but estimates range from several hundred thousand to over one million.\n\nThe primary reason for the German population's departure from the Polish Corridor was the lack of political and economic stability in the region following the war. The new Polish government implemented policies that discriminated against ethnic Germans, such as land expropriation and forced assimilation. Additionally, the economic situation in the area was dire, with high unemployment and a lack of resources.\n\nMany Germans chose to leave the region voluntarily, often moving to other parts of Germany or to other countries such as the United States or Canada. However, some were also forcibly expelled by the Polish government.\n\nThe dispute over the Polish Corridor was a major point of tension between Poland and Germany in the years leading up to the Second World War. The corridor, established by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, had separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany and also separated the German province of Pomerania from the rest of Germany.\n\nAdolf Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany viewed the Polish Corridor as a violation of Germany's territorial integrity and a historical injustice. Hitler and the Nazis argued that the corridor was a \"corridor of shame\" that had been imposed on Germany by the victorious powers of World War I."
