        "text": "He smashed enemy armies in Poland, the Low Countries and Barbarossa. He won several impressive victories on the Eastern front like Smolensk '41, Minsk '41, Kiev '41 and Kharkov '42 and the early battles of Case Blue. You can see that from all the great commanders Germany had, von Bock was given command of Army group centre, the most important of the army groups\n\nHe was an excellent strategist, he tried to conserve resources (supply and forces) and carefully used his forces throughout his campaigns in order to get the pot of gold at the end.\n\nFor the march on Moscow, von Bock needed a straight path without interruptions. The worst winter in 50 years did not help him after the conflicting orders he received nor did Hitler, (as usual) interference with the plans of the army, and he rebounded from that shock with a superb victory at Kharkov II\n\nMaybe it's due to the fact that he was killed without producing 'best selling' memoirs like Manstein, or the West couldn't use him as a bogeyman like they do with Rommel.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nHe certainly was a character, his relative obscurity probably have more to do with him being sidelined before any real american involvement.\n\nI'd say he was as competent as any, his strength being aggressiveness and diligence more then genius. Known as arrogant, egotistical and outspoken, Hitler couldn't deal with this from an embodiment of Prussian high aristocracy when things got sideways. As one of the senior officers in the Reichwehr, he is famous for his lecturers of the younger officer's corps.\n\nHis recurring theme was that the greatest glory that could come to a German soldier was to die for the Fatherland. something that made him known as \"der sterber\" literally the dier, but more accurately the reaper man.\n\nBut he walked the walk too, his citation for his WWI pour le merite was \"reckless bravery\" and he positioned himself at the front all the time. And somewhat appropriately he was the only one of Hitler's field marshal's that died in action. Von Bock and his family was strafed to death by British planes on his way to offer DÃ¶nitz his services after Hitler's death in maj 1945."
