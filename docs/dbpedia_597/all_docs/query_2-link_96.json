        "text": "Post by Fedor von Bock on\n\nFrom some research, I think that this general should be added to the game because of his skills and contribution. And this person is:\n\nHu Lien\n\nA famous ROC general that has a rank similar to \"colonel general\" in the western world. He participated in multiple wars in the second world war and the Chinese civil war. He is a very skillful general that manages to wipe out multiple enemy armies when all other allies are losing. All thanks to his skillful infantry usage and tactics. Later on in the second Taiwan Strait crisis, he held the island of Kinmen with his army and American supplied tanks, and also with the addition of forts and arteries.\n\nFor what his skills in world conqueror 4, he should have 5 to 6 infantry stars, with the addition of 1 to 3 tank star and 2 to 4 stars artillery. For other skills he did not really have, it would be, 0 to 2 air stars and movement and 0 to 3 navy. for the skill effect he should have is defensive skills like elastic defence and entrenchment.\n\nhere is his wiki page, feel free to give other ideas.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Lien\n\nPost by Sun liren on\n\nI think his skill should be something like this\n\n1.infantry leader lvl 3(for his brave resistance and his concentrated attack)\n\n2. Ace force lvl 2(he always reorganize his troop to be ready for battle)\n\n3. Cover lvl 2(fortifications done by him is excellent and able to repell many attack)\n\n4.plain/street fighting (he fight mostly in plain fighting)\n\n5.raiders lvl 3 (many of his battle is him carry his ally)\n\nAny of these three skill plus one your skill to make him a sliver gen\n\nPost by Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby Jr on\n\nI think his skill should be something like this\n\n1.infantry leader lvl 3(for his brave resistance and his concentrated attack)\n\n2.

How many would you give him in each area?\n\nPost by Sun liren on\n\nHe should have 5 to 6 star on infantry(he always command infantry Division like group 12). 1 tank(he only use it in the battle of kinmen). 3 to 4 or 4 to 5 for artillery (during the defence of Taiwan strait he use many artillery to counter Peng.D.H artillery barrage) 0 navy(he never command navy) 3 star foe air(for his efforts on using paratrooper in the defence of Taiwan strait but failed )\n\n4 to 5 movement (his army are always mobile and fast during WW2 and Chinese civil war)\n\nPost by Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby Jr on\n\nSun liren, mm agreed nobody as good as you to advise us on these topics\n\nOn a side note, this is my 700th post, and I am now darth vader in my forum rank!

Special thanks to my dear friend Friedrich “Fried Rice” Paulus, for making me feel right at home and ease in this foreign and new community to me last time, and being a great buddy and chatting friend! Cyrus the Great, Colonel James E. Ross, mexie, proxydragoon, great thanks to you guys being kind and friendly close members of this forum to me special mention to unnamed356 for being so pro in completing the game long ago xD and being a very helpful advisor and friend of mine, Sun liren, for being so knowledgeable and amiable, vasiliy for being one of my earliest friends(paulus was the first), and last but not the least my best :3 pal Fedor von Bock, I remember trying to poke fun at you for sticking with bock as a starter general, but over this one year I have gotten much closer to you and found a great companion in you and your random humour HAHA! Thanks to all others who have helped me in one way or the other in assimilating into this close-knit community, and I really appreciate your help! I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to NetherFreek for being an awesome moderator and working together with me in recent forum work! Look forward to continuing my journey with yall, and cheers to a bright future in this forum!\n\nBest of regards,\n\nyour faithful member howunlucky007, or Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby Jr, =))))))\n\nCongrats on darth vader. And you are correct, Fedor von Bock is a really funny user. His obsession with bock, although rather unhealthy, was really funny.\n\nPost by Friedrich “Fried Rice” Paulus on\n\nThe more rumour the better. But don’t get it if it sacrifices your general’s performance, kind of like how bruchminati did Rundstendt. So like hard hitting generals such as vatutin, all infantry generals, or zhang should get a damage boosting skill instead of rumor\n\nHowever, if you buy a weak general such as Chuikov, its pretty obvious what skill you should shove on him.\n\nHold on, I never knew that Chuikov Is weak, now THAT is sad!\n\nA good damage sponge. But seriously, govorov and alexander are also weak and they are both better than chuikov. Unless you like alexander on infantry (you are insane if you do haha, but at the same time alexander with maxed out infantry stats is probably at around 8th for best infantry general buildable, behind yamashita, macarthur, rundstendt, mannerheim, graziani, montgomery, and vasilevsky.\n\nBut chuikov can be utilized tho as a phenomenal damage sponge. But like, why would you want a damage sponge and nothing else. Graziani Patton or Rokossovsky are much better for that purpose."
