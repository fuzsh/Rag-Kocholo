        "text": "Introduction\n\nOTTO VON BISMARCK was a power in German politics before there even was a Germany; he served as Prussia’s foreign minister (1862–90) and minister president of Prussia (1873–90). From these positions he guided the nineteenth-century wars that rallied the disparate German states to consolidate around Prussia as the first unified German empire since the Middle Ages. Having achieved imperial preeminence in Europe, Bismarck wove an intricate web of alliances to maintain it. Some of these were grand public affairs. Others were top secret. Both, Bismarck believed, would bind all Europe to Germany.\n\nMany contemporaries credited Bismarck with making Europe more peaceful and prosperous than it had ever been. Late in life, however, Bismarck himself was said to have expressed doubts about lasting peace; perhaps apocryphally, he is said to have exclaimed that if a general war began, it would be because of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans. Because Bismark died in 1898, he himself did not witness the final work of the web he had woven. He was gone before Gavrilo Princip, a young Bosnian Serb nationalist, murdered the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. He was not alive to see that event set into motion a sequence of ultimatums, mobilizations, and acts of war, which, through the very system of treaties and secret side agreements his diplomacy had created or inspired, plunged Europe and then much of the world into global conflagration.\n\nThat conflict of 1914 to 1918 began as the Great War, but by the time the United States joined the battle in 1917, it had become a world war. It was ended by armistice on Nov. 11, 1918, having killed approximately 20 million troops and civilians. The thought of another such war, a second world war, was too awful to contemplate. So, the political leaders of the four major powers that had defeated Germany and its allies gathered in Paris to hammer out a peace treaty intended to ensure that this war would be the war to endall wars—a phrase most closely associated with novelist H. G. Wells and U.S. president Woodrow Wilson but widely uttered throughout the conflict.\n\nTragically, what Wilson, Britain’s David Lloyd George, France’s Georges Clemenceau, and Italy’s Vittorio Orlando created was the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, a document intended to punish and permanently cripple Germany and the nations that had supported it. Thanks to this, the 1914–18 conflict became the war to end all peace.\n\nVersailles did not just humiliate Germany, it impoverished it, creating conditions that strangled the struggling new Weimar Republic democracy in its cradle and bred the desperate political and economic environment in which a hate-mongering political opportunist named Adolf Hitler rose to power. In 1920, the National Socialist German Workers’ Party—the NSDAP, or Nazi Party—was one of scores of obscure cultish political organizations in a chaotic Germany. Hitler joined it, dominated it, and, by the elections of 1932, had led it to a plurality in the Reichstag, forcing eighty-five-year-old president Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.\n\nMembers of the Nationalist Socialist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party cheer their leader, Adolf Hitler, as he leaves the Hotel Kaiserhof in Berlin, following his appointment by President Paul von Hindenburg as chancellor of Germany, Jan. 30, 1933.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of March 5, 1933, the Nazis skyrocketed to 44 percent of the vote, which Hitler used to usurp total control of the Reichstag. On March 23, he pushed through that body the Enabling Act, by which the government he now controlled was enabled to issue decrees independently of the Reichstag and Hindenburg. Becoming Germany’s dictator, Hitler used his absolute authority on July 14, 1933, to proclaim the Nazi Party the nation’s only political party. Upon Hindenburg’s death on Aug. 2, 1934, Hitler appointed himself the Führer—absolute leader—of Germany.\n\nBusiness and industry effectively became the Führer’s strategic and political partners. In defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler rearmed the nation, not only expanding Germany’s military—even as the world’s democracies reduced theirs—but obscenely enriching the industrialists while also lifting the nation’s economy out of its postwar recession and the global depression of the 1930s. He also united Germans against what he relentlessly portrayed as their common enemy: the Jews.\n\nOn April 1, 1933, the Nazis instituted a nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses, followed days later by the expulsion of Jews from the civil service and, days after this, restrictions on Jewish attendance at public schools and universities. On Sept. 15, 1935, the Reichstag enacted the Nuremberg Laws, which provided the legal framework for systematic anti-Semitic disenfranchisement throughout Germany. The pre–World War II culmination of this persecution came on the night of November 9, 1938, in a Nazi-orchestrated national riot throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland, during which hundreds of synagogues and more than 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses, homes, and schools were burned down, plundered, or destroyed. So much window glass lay shattered in the streets that the event became known as Kristallnacht (Crystal Night, or the Night of Broken Glass), and was marked by the mass arrest of some 30,000 Jewish men, who were summarily packed off to concentration camps. Early reports estimated 91 deaths, although the actual number is believed to be much higher.\n\nA cozy relationship between business and state prevailed in Fascist Italy, as it did in Nazi Germany, bringing an unaccustomed prosperity to the country and reinforcing support for Benito Il Duce (The Leader) Mussolini—who had been absolute dictator since 1922. Mussolini had visions of recreating in modern Italy the glory that had prevailed in the ancient Roman Empire, and invaded Ethiopia on Oct. 2, 1935. The country’s exiled emperor, Haile Selassie, made an impassioned plea for aid to the League of Nations, which denounced Italy but soon proved powerless to stop the conquest.\n\nABOVE: German troops in Vienna parade past Maj. Gen. Fedor von Bock, one of the commanders of the Nazi occupation and annexation of Austria, March 24, 1938.\n\nAMERICANS SENSED THE STIRRINGS of a new major war. This time, however, they were determined to keep out of it. Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1935 on August 31, imposing a general embargo on trade in arms and war materials and warning American citizens who booked passage on ships of belligerent nations that they traveled at their own risk.\n\nThroughout most of the 1930s, Americans were focused mainly on the ongoing crisis of the Great Depression at home. When they did look abroad, their glance was mainly toward Europe, which they saw as a stage on which a contest between Soviet communism on the one hand and fascism and Nazism on the other was being played out. The epicenter of this drama was Spain, where the Spanish Civil War erupted on July 17, 1936, and would not end until April of 1939. President Franklin Roosevelt declared absolute U.S. neutrality in the conflict, but some 3,000 idealistic young Americans enlisted in the International Brigade to fight against the fascists. Most of these volunteers were members of the American Communist Party.\n\nA minority of Americans turned from Europe to the rising militarism of Japan. The focus was on the Japanese invasion of China and especially on the brutal Battle of Shanghai (Aug. 13 to Nov. 26, 1937), which was covered by numerous Western newsreel and newspaper photographers. Images of the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai in August and October of 1937 were shattering.\n\nDespite graphic coverage of the fighting in China, few Americans seriously believed the United States would ever become involved. The more imminent threat came from Europe, where, on March 12, 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss (connection or union). As many Americans saw it, the Anschluss empowered both Austria and Germany, effectively nullifying the Allied victory in the World War.\n\nTHE ANSCHLUSS WAS FOLLOWED by Hitler’s demand that Czechoslovakia, a nation created by the Treaty of Versailles, cede to Germany its German-speaking region, the Sudetenland. Both France and England were bound by the treaty to defend Czech sovereignty, but neither nation wanted to risk war with Germany. On Sept. 29/30, 1938, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain joined Édouard Daladier of France and Benito Mussolini of Italy in Munich to negotiate with the Führer. Notably, Czech leaders were not invited.\n\nWhen Hitler proved adamant in his demand for annexation, Chamberlain decided to appease him by giving him the Sudeten region in exchange for his pledge to seek nothing further. With that, the prime minister returned to London, stepped down from the airliner, waved a scrap of paper in the air, and announced that he had returned with peace for our time.\n\nWinston Churchill, then no more than a Conservative backbencher in the House of Commons—an unheeded agitator for British rearmament—delivered a speech to the House on Oct. 5 condemning Chamberlain’s so-called peace as a total and unmitigated defeat. Yet no less a figure than Franklin Roosevelt himself, on the eve of Chamberlain’s departure for Munich, sent the prime minister a telegram encouraging his clear intention to appease Hitler. It consisted of just two words: Good man.\n\nIn fact, during Roosevelt’s first two terms in the 1930s, Congress passed four Neutrality Acts, including the 1935 act (see left column on this page). The 1936 act prohibited extending loans or credit to any belligerent in a foreign war, and the 1937 act barred trading arms with Spain during the civil war there. But Roosevelt came increasingly to see U.S. interests as aligned with the opponents of fascism and Nazism. Accordingly, he began enforcing the Neutrality Act of 1937 very selectively, to favor China against Japan. More important, he supported the provision in the 1937 law that authorized him to permit arm sales on a strict cash-and-carry basis. When the fourth Neutrality Act was passed in 1939, FDR lobbied Congress to renew the cash-and-carry provision but was refused.\n\nPresident Roosevelt lived with the new restrictions of the 1939 law but began a covert correspondence with Churchill in September 1939, immediately after German forces invaded Poland and started the war. At the time, Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty in the Chamberlain War Cabinet, but the correspondence intensified beginning in May 1940, when Churchill replaced Chamberlain as prime minister.\n\nJune 1940 brought the fall of France, which rapidly accelerated the decline of isolationism in America. About to run for an unprecedented third term, FDR named two prominent pro-intervention GOP leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as his secretaries of war and the navy, respectively. With bipartisan support, the president secured congressional funding for a crash military buildup and, in September, signed the nation’s first peacetime draft into law.\n\nFDR also deliberately violated the 1939 Neutrality Act by supporting Britain with his Destroyers for Bases Agreement (see page 15). On Dec. 29, he broadcast a speech in which he announced his intention to make America the Arsenal of Democracy for Britain and other allies. This was followed on Jan. 6, 1941, by his articulation of the Four Freedoms in his State of the Union Address. Freedom of speech and of worship, and freedom from want and from fear, he declared, were American rights and should be regarded as human rights everywhere in the world.\n\nThroughout 1941, FDR moved closer and closer to war and repeatedly secured more military funding. Indeed, although the Japanese attack against Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, was a surprise, it propelled the United States into war far better prepared to fight than it had ever been in its 165-year history.\n\nFROM THE MOMENT of the nation’s entry into World War II, President Roosevelt cultivated a frank approach to the American people. We are now in this war, he explained in his Fireside Chat broadcast of Dec. 9:\n\nWe are all in it—all the way. Every single man, woman, and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history. We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories—the changing fortunes of war.\n\nSo far, the news has been all bad. . . .\n\nAnd so he shared the war news, bad and good, just as the free people of the United States expected him to do and just as they demanded and expected the free American press to do, day after day and in real time.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Oval Office during his Fireside Chat On the Declaration of War with Japan on Dec. 9, 1941.\n\nFDR wears a black mourning armband for his mother, who died on Sept. 7.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1939\n\nPeace for our time, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain had promised in September 1938, on returning from his conference with Hitler in Munich. There, desperate to at least delay a war for which Britain was woefully unprepared, he appeased Hitler by handing him the Czech Sudetenland in exchange for the Führer’s promise to seek no further conquest.\n\nOn March 15, the Reich bit off and gulped down what remained of Czechoslovakia, annexing Bohemia and Moravia-Silesia in blatant violation of the Munich Agreement. The very next day, Germany created the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, obliterating with the stroke of a pen the short-lived Second Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nAlso on March 16, German-aligned Hungary annexed Carpatho-Ukraine, and four days later, Germany’s foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded that Lithuania cede the Baltic port of Klaipeda and the surrounding region (the Memel Territory, which the Germans called Memelland). Though obligated by treaty to defend Klaipeda, Britain and France made no response to the German demand. Memelland was annexed to East Prussia on March 23.\n\nOne day after the Memel ultimatum, on March 21, Hitler demanded that the strategic Baltic port of Danzig (present-day Gdansk, Poland), proclaimed an autonomous city-state after World War I, be returned to Germany. The League of Nations, sworn to protect the independence of Danzig, made no response, and pro-Nazi German residents of Danzig agitated for annexation. By the end of March, however, France had joined the U.K. in a guarantee of Polish independence, thereby making any German aggression against that country a cause for war. On April 3, Hitler ordered his generals to prepare Fall Weiss (Plan White), the invasion of Poland.\n\nIn the meantime, the Fascist Duce (leader) of Italy, Benito Mussolini, ordered an invasion of Albania during April 7–12, which led to that country being annexed to Italy. On April 14, an alarmed U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt sent letters to Hitler and Mussolini calling for peace. Four days later, the USSR approached France and Britain with a proposal for a three-way pact. It was rejected, even as Hitler, on April 28, renounced the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, a treaty limiting the size of the Nazi navy, the Kriegsmarine.\n\nOn May 17, Hitler offered nonaggression pacts to Sweden, Norway, and Finland, all of which rebuffed him; but on May 22, he and Mussolini concluded the Pact of Steel. Publicly, it proclaimed nothing more than trust and cooperation between the two nations, but a Secret Supplementary Protocol created a military and economic union.\n\nAfter much delay, Britain’s Neville Chamberlain responded on July 10 to Hitler’s March 21 demand to annex Danzig by rejecting the Führer’s contention that the fate of Danzig was an internal German-Polish affair and reaffirmed that the U.K. would come to Poland’s aid in the event of German aggression against that nation. It was now clear that battle lines had been drawn, and Europe was on the verge of the second great war in a generation. But few expected what came next.\n\nOn August 23, headlines of news stories breathless with disbelief announced that the foreign secretaries of the Soviet Union and Germany had signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in which the two nations pledged mutual nonaggression. The shock was that Soviet Communism and German Fascism/Nazism were ideologically, politically, and (as many saw it) morally irreconcilable. The anti-fascist leaders and peoples of the world, especially in the democracies, had counted on Stalin’s unshakeable opposition to Hitler, which they believed would ultimately check German aggression. The pledge of nonaggression dashed this hope.\n\nHow much greater the shock would have been had the democracies known the content of the pact’s secret provisions, which called for the division of Eastern Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany, with joint occupation of Poland and Soviet occupation of the Baltic States as well as of Finland and Bessarabia. Those secret portions of the pact were nothing less than a joint venture agreement for European conquest.\n\nSecret, too, was a document drawn up earlier in the month, on Aug. 2. It was a letter drafted by Leo Szilard, a physicist newly fled from Hungary to the United States to escape anti-Semitic persecution. It was elaborated upon and endorsed by Albert Einstein, a Jewish refugee from Hitler’s Germany who, ensconced at Princeton University, was the world’s most famous and revered living scientist. The addressee of the letter was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and its subject was an urgent warning that German scientists were hard at work harnessing the explosive power of the atom to make nuclear weapons. Roosevelt heeded the warning and, later, authorized one of history’s costliest, most massively complex scientific and technological endeavors, the Manhattan Project, which produced the weapons used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nOn Aug. 30, Hitler issued an ultimatum to Poland, demanding the return of Danzig and a plebiscite on possession of the Polish Corridor that would give Germany access to the Baltic. Absent a response from Poland, Gestapo agents staged an attack on a German radio transmitter at the German town of Gleiwitz (modern-day Gliwice, Poland), on the Polish frontier. They arrested a Silesian Polish-sympathizer outside of Gleiwitz, and, on the night of Aug. 31, dressed him in the uniform of a Polish soldier and gave him a lethal injection. He was then taken to the transmitter station, where he was shot. The next day, Sept. 1, Adolf Hitler announced to the Reischstag and to the world that Polish soldiers had been shot during an unprovoked attack by the Polish army on German territory.\n\nThus, Hitler justified a titanic invasion of Poland by some 1.5 million troops, unimpeded by the Soviet Union. They were hopelessly opposed by the 800,000 men of the Polish army, whose valiant resistance, outmanned and outgunned, was doomed. The country was soon overrun by blitzkrieg (lightning war), which hit with unparalleled speed, violence, and the brilliant coordination of infantry, armor, and aircraft. On Sept. 3, with Poland all but defeated, France and Britain declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.\n\nHitler (left, under the end of the long-range gun barrel) inspects fiercely contested Oxhoeft (Oksywie), near Gdynia, Poland, one of the last areas of resistance after the Nazi invasion of that country, Sept. 21, 1939.\n\nCorsicana Daily Sun, Corsicana, TX, Wednesday, March 15, 1939\n\nHITLER GRABS CZECH NATION\n\nGerman Commander Taxes – Executive Power in Bohemia\n\nPRAGUE, March 15 (AP)—General Johannes Blaskowitz, commander of group three of the German army, proclaimed to the people of Bohemia today that he had taken the executive power into his hands on orders from Chancellor Hitler.\n\nGeneral Blaskowitz appointed the Sudeten Nazi Leader Konrad Henlein as chief of the civil administration of Bohemia.\n\nHenlein, instrumental in bringing about the German annexation of Sudetenland last October, asked the whole Bohemian administrative machinery—police, postal, railway and state affairs—to continue its work.\n\nGerman troops of occupation were hissed and cheered today as they moved into positions of control in the once proud capital of free Czecho-Slovakia.\n\nCheers of German welcomers were interspersed with the hissing of Czech patriots and cries of pfui, pfui, go back home! Some patriots sang the Czech national anthem. Two persons were reported struck by German military automobiles. There were no serious disorders, however.\n\nEnd of Czech Sovereignty\n\nThe entry of Adolf Hitler’s battalions marked the end of Czech sovereignty in the shattered republic which dissolved yesterday after [the] Hitler-inspired secession of Slovakia which followed in the wake of the Munich dismemberment.\n\nThe easternmost division of Czecho-Slovakia—Carpatho-Ukraine—was being occupied by Hungarian troops. German occupation of the Czech western part, Bohemia and Moravia, was agreed upon in Berlin last night when Emil Hacha, former Czech president, placed the area under Hitler’s protection.\n\nHitler was on the way to join his marching legions.\n\nHuge crowds were massed along the central streets of Prague as the troops, in four groups, moved in.\n\nGet Bronx Cheer\n\nAt times the Pfui’s—continental version of the Bronx cheer—were so loud they could be heard blocks away. The crowds grew more demonstrative as the troops increased in number.\n\nHere and there the troops were encouraged by cries from German crowds wearing swastika armbands.\n\nBefore the ancient Rathaus (city council building) a large German delegation had gathered, bearing a swastika banner of heroic size which the Nazis like to hang from their public buildings. But it was the only one in sight.\n\nNo flags of any sort decorated the houses or streets. Some street cars flew various flags but they were the Czech colors, such as would be flown on a national holiday.\n\nIt was the most lifeless and colorless reception that Reichsführer Hitler’s troops had received since the Führer started his expansion program.\n\nThe contrast between today’s reception and the flowers and kisses with which Nazi troops were welcomed when they occupied Sudetenland last October was most striking.\n\nLEFT: Mechanized units rumble across the Czech border, March 17, 1939, several days after Hitler claimed executive power in the Czech Lands and established it as a Nazi territory, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nCzech subjects watch in despair, booing Pfui, pfui, go back home! as German motorcycle units roll into their capital, March 15, 1939.\n\nNashville Banner, Nashville, TN, Thursday, March 16, 1939\n\nABSTRACT OF HITLER PROCLAMATION ON STATUS OF NEW PROTECTORATE\n\nPRAGUE, March 16 (AP)—Following is an abstract of Chancellor Hitler’s proclamation of protectorate over Bohemia and Moravia, delivered by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.\n\nFor a thousand years Bohemian and Moravian lands were part of the living space of the German people. But force and lack of reason tore them arbitrarily from their old historic environment and finally, through their inclusion in the artificial formation of Czecho-Slovakia, created a center of disturbance.\n\nAt any time from this space a new and formidable threat to European peace was bound to arise. This had happened once before. That is because the Czecho-Slovak state and those in charge of it did not succeed in the sensible organization of the common life of national groups, which were"
