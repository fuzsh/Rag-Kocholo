        "text": "Fedor von Bock (born December 3, 1880, Küstrin, Germany [now Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland]—died May 1945, Lensahn, Holstein) was a German army officer and field marshal (from 1940), who participated in the German occupation of Austria and the invasions of Poland, France, and Russia during World War II.\n\nEducated at the Potsdam military school, Bock was assigned to an infantry guards regiment in 1897 and advanced to a captaincy by 1914. Emerging from World War I as a major, he became commander of the Third Army group in 1920 and remained in that post until 1938, when Adolf Hitler made him commander of the First Army group. During the invasion of Belgium and France in May and June 1940, he commanded the lower Somme army group. He was one of the 12 German generals whom Hitler created field marshals of the Reich on July 19, 1940.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II"
