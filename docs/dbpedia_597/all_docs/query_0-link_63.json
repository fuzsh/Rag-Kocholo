        "text": "Pipeline corridors through wetlands - impacts on plant communities: Deep Creek and Brandy Branch crossings, Nassau County, Florida\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nShem, L.M.; Van Dyke, G.D.; Zimmerman, R.E.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nThe goal of the Gas Research Institute Wetland Corridors Program is to document impacts of existing pipelines on the wetlands they traverse. To accomplish this goal, 12 existing wetland crossings were surveyed. These sites varied in elapsed time since pipeline construction, wetland type, pipeline installation techniques, and right-of-way (ROW) management practices. This report presents the results of surveys conducted July 14-18, 1992, at the Deep Creek and the Brandy Branch crossings of a pipeline installed during May 1991 in Nassau County, Florida. Both floodplains supported bottomland hardwood forests. The pipeline at the Deep Creek crossing was installed by means of horizontal directional drilling after the ROW had been clear-cut, while the pipeline at the Brandy Branch crossing was installed by means of conventional open trenching. Neither site was seeded or fertilized. At the time of sampling, a dense vegetative community, made up primarily of native perennial herbaceous species, occupied the ROW within the Deep Creek floodplain. The Brandy Branch ROW was vegetated by a less dense stand of primarily native perennial herbaceous plants. Plant diversity was also lower at the Brandy Branch crossing than at the Deep Creek crossing. The results suggest that some of the differences in plant communities are related to the more hydric conditions at the Brandy Branch floodplain.\n\n27 CFR 19.648 - Age of brandy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 27 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Age of brandy. 19.648 Section 19.648 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAX AND TRADE BUREAU, DEPARTMENT...

Significant principal components computed by a double cross-validation procedure allowed the structure of the database to be visualized as a function of the raw material, that is, cider made from fresh apple juice versus cider made from apple juice concentrate. Feasible and robust discriminant rules were computed and validated by a cross-validation procedure that allowed the authors to classify fresh and concentrate cider brandies, obtaining classification hits of >92%. The most discriminating variables for typifying cider brandies according to their raw material were 1-butanol and ethyl hexanoate.\n\nThe determination of furaldehyde and benzaldehyde in plum brandy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRajkoviÄ MiloÅ¡ B.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Among all alcohol liqueurs, brandies from drupaceous plants are characterized with the highest level of hydro cyanic acid, benzaldehyde and ethylcarbamate. In fruit brandies ethylcarbamate mainly originates from hydro cyanic acid during the processes of alcohol fermentation of crushed fruit and its preservation, distillation and ripening of the brandy. Hydro cyanic acid and benzaldehyde arise from the hydrolysis of amygdaline that is found exist in the heart of fruit stones and seeds, as well as from the hydrolysis of prunasine from the skin and flesh of drupaceous plants. The content of amygdaline and prunazine depends on the type of fruit, which corresponds to the potential content of hydro cyanic acid and benzaldehyde in the brandy that corresponds the stoichiometric ratio 1:3.94. The content of the aldehydes: furfural and benzaldehyde in plum brandy, strong plum brandy, young brandy, of domestic production in the various regions of Serbia were analyzed in this paper.\n\nFormation of siliceous sediments in brandy after diatomite filtration.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGÃ³mez, J; Gil, M L A; de la Rosa-Fox, N; Alguacil, M\n\n2015-03-01\n\nBrandy is quite a stable spirit but sometimes light sediment appears. This sediment was separated and analysed by IR and SEM-EDX. It was revealed that the sediment is composed mostly of silica and residual organic matter. Silica was present as an amorphous phase and as microparticles. In an attempt to reproduce the formation of the sediment, a diatomite extract was prepared with an ethanol/water mixture (36% vol.) and a calcined diatomite similar to that used in brandy filtration. This extract was added to unfiltered brandy in different amounts. After 1 month, the Si concentration decreased in all samples and sediments with similar compositions and features to those found in the unstable brandy appeared. The amounts of sediment obtained were directly related to the decrease in Si concentration in solution. Consequently, it can be concluded that siliceous sediment in brandy originates from Si released during diatomite filtration. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of this extracts led to the identification of 99 components, including 46 esters, 7 hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes, 3 aldehydes, 9 alcohols, 1 lactone, 1 ketone, 8 acetals, 14 terpenes, 8 acids and 2 phenols. Ethyl esters of C8âC18 acids were the most abundant in all samples. In addition, the content of methanol, ethanol and higher alcohols C3âC5 was determined.\n\nEmpirical estimation of per capita brandy demand in Armenia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS.A. Movsisyan\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The empirical estimations were based on linear and double-log regression models, which identified the factors influencing the average per capita brandy demand in Armenia. The model was estimated using quarterly time-series data on per capita brandy consumption, disposable income, prices of various alcoholic beverages for 1997â2015 periods. This is quantitative study based on secondary annual, quarterly and monthly data, and 5% significance level. The average annual per capita brandy consumption data for 1997â2007 periods was obtained from WHO's website, whereas the 2008â2015 data was extracted from the National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia. For annual, quarterly and monthly periods from 1997 through 2015, the price data related to various alcoholic beverages, consumer price index were provided in NSS statistical publications of âSocio-Economic Situation of RAâ, âConsumer price indexes (prices in the Republic of Armeniaâ, âPrices and tariffs in the Republic of Armeniaâ. For 1997â2015 periods, the average monthly per capita monetary income data was obtained from âLiving Standards of Population and Social Sphereâ section of statistical yearbooks. The latter substituted the average per capita monthly disposable income data, since these data were unavailable. Meantime, since the data included numerous years, therefore, the nominal price and income data were adjusted for inflation using consumer price index with 2005 as base year. In conclusion, the average real prices of wine and vodka were statistically significant determinants of the average per capita brandy demand in Armenia, and the demand for brandy was inelastic.\n\nThe effects of the fermentation with immobilized yeast and different cherry varieties on the quality of cherry brandy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR. MiliÄeviÄ\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this research was to investigate influence of different fermentation processes (by immobilized yeast cells and classical fermentation and different cherry varieties (Maraska, Montmorencys and Kelleris on the chemical and sensorial characteristics of cherry brandies. Cherry brandies were analyzed to determine chemical composition, aroma profile and sensory properties. Cherry brandies produced by immobilized yeast cells had a higher content of aldehydes, but lower content of total acids, total extract, higher alcohols and esters compared to the samples produced by classical fermentation process. Furfural was not detected in cherry distillates produced by immobilized yeast cells, while distillates produced by classical fermentation process had very low content. Cherry brandies produced by classical fermentation process had significantly higher content of benzaldehyde which has great influence on aroma of cherry brandies. Ethyl octanoate which is considered one of the most important contributors to the aroma of alcoholic distillates was found in the highest concentrations in Maraska distillates. The best evaluated sample was brandy produced from Maraska cherry variety fermented by immobilized yeast cells followed by brandy produced also from Maraska cherry variety, but by classical fermentation process.\n\n27 CFR 19.318 - Addition of caramel to rum or brandy and addition of oak chips to spirits.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... or brandy and addition of oak chips to spirits. 19.318 Section 19.318 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and...

Electrophoretic mobility of these compounds is achieved by a borate buffer at pH 9.3. At this pH, the sensitivity of UV detection of these phenolic aldehydes also increases. UV absorptions at 348, 362, 404, and 422 nm were selected for monitoring vanillin, syringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and sinapaldehyde, respectively. This procedure was performed simultaneously during one run using a diode array detector. Samples of brandy or wine were analyzed directly without concentration, extraction, or any other preliminary treatment of the test sample. The limits of detection were found to be 0.275, 0.1425, 0.1475, and 0.1975 ppm for syringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, sinapaldehyde, and vanillin, respectively, which is acceptable for analysis of both brandy and wine aged in oak barrels. The method has been shown to be linear in a range from 0.3 to 57 mg/L. Recoveries ranged between 99.9% and 107.7% for all of the compounds tested. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were high. The relative standard deviation was consequently approximately 3% and also between 4.47% and 6.89% for all tested compounds. The method is useful for the identification of counterfeit brandy, which is easy to recognize by the absence of sinapaldehyde, syringaldehyde, and coniferaldehyde, which are not detectable in false brandy.\n\n27 CFR 19.343 - Addition of oak chips to spirits and addition of caramel to brandy and rum.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... spirits and addition of caramel to brandy and rum. 19.343 Section 19.343 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and...

Cold stabilisation treatment involved holding of the brandy at -1Â°C during 24 hours. Five depth filter sheets with the nominal retention rate of 0.3 Î¼m, 0.5-0.7 Î¼m, 0.7-1.0 Î¼m, 1.0-2.0 Î¼m and 2.5-4.0 Î¼m, were tested in the study. It was shown that all assessed filter sheets were efficient in removing chill haze by significantly reducing the content of fatty acid esters (primarily ethyl palmitate and ethyl laurate. Other volatile and aromatic compounds were not significantly influenced by the applied treatments. However, the filter sheets with higher nominal retention rate (> 0.7 Î¼m, had a smaller impact on the sensory characteristics of the apricot brandy. The re-exposure to lower temperatures did not lead to chill haze formation in any sample obtained after sheet filtration. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. TR-31002\n\nEffect of alcoholic fermentation on the quality of grape brandies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVukosavljeviÄ Vera\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Grape brandy is a product obtained by fermentation and distillation of crushed grapes of cultivated grapevine Vitis vinifera. Grape brandy quality depends on many factors such as: grapevine varieties, climate, soil, time and method of distillation, storage methods and other distillates. The grapevine variety 'Neoplanta' grown in the experimental field of the PD 'Center for Viticulture and Enology' in NiÅ¡ was used in the experiment. Tests were performed in the laboratory of the Centre. Healthy grapes of harvest maturity were squashed by a stalk-removing electric crusher. Fermentation was performed in plastic containers in the presence of the indigenous microflora of wine yeasts. This paper presents the influence of pH and inorganic nitrogen added to the fermentation medium on the content of volatile components and concentrations of higher alcohols.\n\nThe effects of the cherry variety on the chemical and sensorial characteristics of cherry brandy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNINOSLAV NIKIÄEVIÄ\n\n2011-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The chemical and sensorial characteristics of cherry brandy produced from five cherry varieties (Oblacinska, Celeryâs 16, Rexle, Heimanâs Ruby and Heimanâs Conserve grown in Serbia were studied. Gas chromatography and gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry analysis of these distillates led to the identification of 32 components, including 20 esters, benzaldehyde, 6 terpenes and 5 acids. The ethyl esters of C8âC18 acids were the most abundant in all samples. The benzaldehyde content was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The average benzaldehyde concentration in the samples ranged between 2.1 and 24.1 mg L-1. The total sensory scores of the cherry brandies ranged between 17.30 to 18.05, with the cherry brandy produced from the Celeryâs 16 variety receiving the highest score (18.05.\n\nNew method for the discovery of adulterated cognacs and brandies based on solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDarya Mozhayeva\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The article represents new method for discovery of adulterated cognacs and brandies based on solidphase microextraction (SPME in combination with gas chromatography â mass spectrometry (GC-MS. The work comprised optimization of SPME parameters (extraction temperature and time, concentration of added salt with subsequent analysis of authentic samples and comparison of the obtained chromatograms using principal component analysis (PCA. According to the obtained results, increase of extraction temperature resulted in an increase of response of the most volatile brandy constituents. To avoid chemical transformations and/or degradation of the samples, the extraction temperature must be limited to 30!C. Increase of the extraction time lead to higher total peak area, but longer extraction times (>10 min for 100 Âµm polydimethylsiloxane and >2 min for divinylbenzene/Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibers caused displacement of analytes. Salt addition increased total response of analytes, but caused problems with reproducibility. The developed method was successfully applied for discovery of adulterated samples of brandy, cognac, whisky and whiskey sold in Kazakhstan. The obtained data was analyzed applying principal component analysis (PCA. Five adulterated brandy and whisky samples were discovered and confirmed. The developed method is recommended for application in forensic laboratories.\n\nCross-Cultural Training of Expatriate Faculty Teaching in International Branch Campuses\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJauregui, Martin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study investigates the intersection between academics and culture in international branch campus using Stier's (2006) \"cross-cultural characteristics and competencies.\" The purpose of this study was to examine the type of cross-cultural training being used by the international branch campuses in Qatar's Education City, in particularâ¦\n\nThe influence of selected senses on consumer experience: A brandy case\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nChris Pentz; Charlene Gerber\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOrientation: Sensory marketing has become a popular marketing technique to enhance consumer experience.

Application to wines and brandies stored in oak barrels].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSalagoity-Auguste, M H; Tricard, C; Sudraud, P\n\n1987-04-17\n\nAromatic aldehydes (vanillin, syringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde) and coumarins (esculetin, umbelliferone, scopoletin and methylumbelliferone) are natural wood compounds. Storage of wines and brandies in oak barrels increases notably aldehydes and coumarins (particularly scopoletin) concentrations. These compounds were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, on hydrocarbon bonded reversed-phase packings, with a water-acetonitrile elution gradient. They were first extracted from wines and brandies by diethyl ether and then injected on chromatographic column. A double detection was used to determine simultaneously aromatic aldehydes and coumarins by UV absorption and fluorescence respectively.\n\nApplication of FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy for the quality control of wine spirits, brandies and grape marc spirits\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAnjos, O.; Caldeira, I.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study attempted to apply a rapid method for the determination of methanol, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate in wine spirits, brandies and grape marc spirits, using Fourier Transform Infrared â Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Spectroscopy.\n\nDissociative Recombination and Excitation of CH+5 : Absolute Cross Sections and Branching Fractions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSemaniak, J.; Larson, A.; Le Padellec, A.; Stroemholm, C.; Larsson, M.; Rosen, S.; Peverall, R.; Danared, H.; Djuric, N.; Dunn, G.H.; Datz, S.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe heavy-ion storage ring CRYRING was used to measure the absolute dissociative recombination and dissociative excitation cross sections for collision energies below 50 eV. Deduced thermal rates coefficients are consistent with previous beams data but are lower by a factor of 3 than the rates measured by means of the flowing afterglow Langmuir probe technique. A resonant structure in dissociative recombination cross section was found at 9 eV. We have determined the branching fractions in DR of CH + 5 below 0.2 eV. The branching is dominated by three-body CH 3 + H + H and CH 2 + H 2 + H dissociation channels, which occur with branching ratios of â¼0.7 and â¼0.2, respectively; thus methane is a minor species among dissociation products. Both the measured absolute cross sections and branching in dissociative recombination of CH + 5 can have important implications for the models of dense interstellar clouds and abundance of CH 2 , CH 3 and CH 4 in these media. copyright copyright 1998.

We used linear sweep (LSV) and differential-pulse (DPV) voltammetry with cathodic stripping for CNTPE containing mineral oil or silicone as binder. The analytical curves were linear from 30 to 110Î¼gL(-1) and from 10 to 110Î¼gL(-1) for LSV and DPV, respectively. The limits of detection (L.O.D.) and quantification (L.O.Q.) of CNTPE were 10.3 and 34.5Î¼gL(-1) for mineral oil and 3.4 and 11.2Î¼gL(-1) for silicone. We applied this method to determine arsenic in five commercial sugarcane brandy samples. The results agreed well with those obtained by hydride generation combined with atomic absorption spectrometry (HG AAS). Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivation for the study: Even though the use of the senses such as sight, sound and smell is a popular sensory marketing tool in the field of experiential marketing, applying such marketing techniques is a challenging and costly exercise for marketers, and researchers have called for more studies on senses and consumer experience. Research design, approach and method: A full factorial laboratory experiment (2 x 2 x 2 was conducted where 240 spirits consumers indicated the tastiness of a brandy sample under certain conditions. Main findings: Results revealed that, within a laboratory setting, consumers recorded lower levels of tastiness under conditions where more senses were manipulated than in conditions where less senses were manipulated. Practical/managerial implications: The results of the study coincided with previous results, which indicated that, within certain product categories, sensory marketing could actually decrease the consumerâs experience as sensory overload could occur. Contribution/value-add: In the endeavour to reduce possible sensory overload in the alcohol industry, the findings suggest that marketers should not apply sensory marketing indiscriminately to all product categories. For example, on a retail level, where experimental marketing might be too costly or even too complex to apply to some product categories, marketers should rather rethink the use of sensory marketing strategies within certain industries and focus on other marketing strategies, such a brand building.\n\nMis teeb Ã¼he brand'i teistest paremaks? : VÃµidu tÃ¤hendusrikkuse poole / Mauri SÃ¶Ã¶t\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nSÃ¶Ã¶t, Mauri\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBalti riikides lÃ¤bi viidud brand'iuuringust Meaningful Brands, millega selgitati, kuidas brand'id mÃµjutavad inimese heaolu individuaalses ja kollektiivses tÃ¤henduses.

This result is then used to derive another theoretical formula for the behavior of the ratio of two partial cross sections (i.e., the branching ratio) in the vicinity of a resonance. This branching-ratio formula depends on the profile parameters q, GAMMA, and rho 2 for the resonance, on the branching ratio outside the resonance, and on two new parameters which are explicitly related to scattering-matrix elements and phase shifts\n\nTheory, methodology and practice â Cesare Brandi and wall painting restoration in Denmark in the 20th century\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBrajer, Isabelle Eve\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper presents connections between theory and practice in the aesthetic treatment of wall painting in Denmark, with an emphasis on the assimilation (or lack of) of Brandi's theories.

In the present study, OCC contributions were investigated for 4- and 6-arm star-branched and H-branched polymers by means of multi-chain slip-link simulations. Owing to the molecular-level description of the simulation, the segment orientation was traced separately for each molecule as well as each subchain composing the molecules. Then, the OCC was calculated between different molecules and different subchains. The results revealed that the amount of OCC between different molecules is virtually identical to that of linear polymers regardless of the branching structure. The OCC between constituent subchains of the same molecule is significantly smaller than the OCC between different molecules, although its intensity and time-dependent behavior depend on the branching structure as well as the molecular weight. These results lend support to the single-chain models given that the OCC effects are embedded into the stress-optical coefficient, which is independent of the branching structure.\n\nA missive against the tupiniquim peronism - Carlos Lacerda, Tribuna da Imprensa and the Brandi letter (1955.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRodolpho Gauthier Cardoso dos Santos\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This article analyses an episode of the Political History of Brazil known as Brandi letter, which controversy occurred some days before the 1955âs Brazilian election for president. The main historical source of this paper is the carioca newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa, whose ownership was in the hands of Carlos Lacerda, federal deputy from UDN (UniÃ£o DemocrÃ¡tica Nacional. In September of that year, this newspaper scandalously published a letter attributed to an argentinian peronist deputy named Antonio Brandi. The message would have been sent to JoÃ£o Goulart that was by that time the president of the PTB (Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro and a candidate for the vice-presidency with the support of Juscelino Kubitschek. The controversial content of the letter, which explicitly tells about the formation of âbrigades of shock workersâ and the acquisition of products from Cordobaâs military factory, disrupted the electoral process. Politicians and conservative newspaper alleged that the election of the trabalhista leader would carry the country to a dictatorship with the Argentinian support. This academic work analyses the agency of Tribuna da Imprensa and of his owner in this convulsed moment of Brazilian politics, in which the antiperonist imaginary was very strong.\n\nToxicity and Safety Profiles of Methanolic Extract of Pistacia integerrima J.

Starting from the apple aroma the changes in aroma components were studied quantitatively during the conventional production (without enzyme inhibition) as well as after HTST-heating (enzyme inactivation) of the mash. For this purpose 98 aroma compounds were determined in the course of mash production, fermentation and distillation. When employing HTST-heating the original aroma components of the apple particularly the fruit esters were present in appreciably higher concentrations in the mash as well as in the distillate than with the conventional production method. Simultaneously HTST-heating reduced the secondary aroma substances in mash and distillate which are formed with the conventional method by enzymatic-oxidative processes. In the unaged apple brandy obtained from HTST-treated mash lower amounts of lactates and higher concentrations of acetals were found compared with the conventionally produced distillate.\n\nDevelopment and validation of LC-MS/MS method with multiple reactions monitoring mode for quantification of vanillin and syringaldehyde in plum brandies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTeÅ¡eviÄ Vele\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method with multiple reactions monitoring mode (MRM has been developed and validated for quantification of vanillin and syringaldehyde in plum brandy.

The so-called weak ${s}$-process component, which is responsible for most of the ${s}$ abundances between Fe and Sr, turned out to be very sensitive to the stellar neutron capture cross sections in this mass region and, in particular, of isotopes near the seed distribution around Fe. In this context, the unstable isotope $^{63}$Ni is of particular interest because it represents the first branching point in the reaction path of the ${s}$-process. We propose to measure this cross section at n_TOF from thermal energies up to 500 keV, covering the entire range of astrophysical interest. These data are needed to replace uncertain theoretical predicitons by first experimental information to understand the consequences of the $^{63}$Ni branching for the abundance pattern of the subsequent isotopes, especially for $^{63}$Cu and $^{...\n\nChampagne flutes and brandy snifters: modelling protostellar outflow-cloud chemical interfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRollins, R. P.; Rawlings, J. M. C.; Williams, D. A.; Redman, M. P.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nA rich variety of molecular species has now been observed towards hot cores in star-forming regions and in the interstellar medium. An increasing body of evidence from millimetre interferometers suggests that many of these form at the interfaces between protostellar outflows and their natal molecular clouds. However, current models have remained unable to explain the origin of the observational bias towards wide-angled `brandy snifter' shaped outflows over narrower `champagne flute' shapes in carbon monoxide imaging. Furthermore, these wide-angled systems exhibit unusually high abundances of the molecular ion HCO+. We present results from a chemodynamic model of such regions where a rich chemistry arises naturally as a result of turbulent mixing between cold, dense molecular gas and the hot, ionized outflow material. The injecta drives a rich and rapid ion-neutral chemistry in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the observations. The observational bias towards wide-angled outflows is explained naturally by the geometry-dependent ion injection rate causing rapid dissociation of CO in the younger systems.\n\nComparison of revegetation of a gas pipeline right-of-way in two forested wetland crossings involving conventional methods of pipeline installation and horizontal drilling, Nassau County, Florida\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVan Dyke, G.D. [Trinity Christian Coll., Palos Heights, IL (United States). Dept. of Biology; Shem, L.M.; Zimmerman, R.E. [Argonne National Lab., IL (United States)\n\n1993-10-01\n\nOne year after pipeline installation, vegetation in the right-of-way (ROW) was inventoried at two stream floodplain crossings in Nassau County, Florida. Both sites were forested wetlands composed of Acer rubrum, Fraxinus caroliniana, Liquidamber styraciflua, Nyssa ogecho, Quercus laurifolia, and Taxodium distichum, together with other wetland trees. Pipeline installation across the Brandy Branch floodplain was by conventional ditching and backfill methods. Installation across the Deep Creek floodplain was by horizontal drilling after clearcutting the ROW. The latter method left tree stumps, understory vegetation, and soil layers intact, except for disruptions caused by logging. According to the inventory, vegetation at the drilled site was more diverse (nearly twice as many species occurring in the ROW as at the trenched site) and more robust (no unvegetated exposed soil compared to 15% at the trenched site). Differences between the ROW vegetation at the two sites can be attributed to both site differences and installation technologies used.\n\nTree Branching: Leonardo da Vinci's Rule versus Biomechanical Models\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMinamino, Ryoko; Tateno, Masaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study examined Leonardo da Vinci's rule (i.e., the sum of the cross-sectional area of all tree branches above a branching point at any height is equal to the cross-sectional area of the trunk or the branch immediately below the branching point) using simulations based on two biomechanical models: the uniform stress and elastic similarity models. Model calculations of the daughter/mother ratio (i.e., the ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the daughter branches to the cross-sectional area of the mother branch at the branching point) showed that both biomechanical models agreed with da Vinci's rule when the branching angles of daughter branches and the weights of lateral daughter branches were small; however, the models deviated from da Vinci's rule as the weights and/or the branching angles of lateral daughter branches increased. The calculated values of the two models were largely similar but differed in some ways. Field measurements of Fagus crenata and Abies homolepis also fit this trend, wherein models deviated from da Vinci's rule with increasing relative weights of lateral daughter branches. However, this deviation was small for a branching pattern in nature, where empirical measurements were taken under realistic measurement conditions; thus, da Vinci's rule did not critically contradict the biomechanical models in the case of real branching patterns, though the model calculations described the contradiction between da Vinci's rule and the biomechanical models. The field data for Fagus crenata fit the uniform stress model best, indicating that stress uniformity is the key constraint of branch morphology in Fagus crenata rather than elastic similarity or da Vinci's rule. On the other hand, mechanical constraints are not necessarily significant in the morphology of Abies homolepis branches, depending on the number of daughter branches. Rather, these branches were often in agreement with da Vinci's rule.

We know that the branching mechanism has an important effect on the stress distribution and stability of a tree in the wind. Eloy in PRL 2011, showed that Leonardo da Vinci's original observation which states the total cross section of branches is conserved across branching nodes is the best configuration for resisting wind-induced fracture in rigid trees. However, prediction of the fracture risk and pattern of a tree is also a function of their reconfiguration capabilities and how they mitigate large wind-induced stresses. In this studies through developing an efficient numerical simulation of flexible branched trees, we explore the role of the tree flexibility on the optimal branching. Our results show that the probability of a tree breaking at any point depends on both the cross-section changes in the branching nodes and the level of tree flexibility. It is found that the branching mechanism based on Leonardo da Vinci's original observation leads to a uniform stress distribution over a wide range of flexibilities but the pattern changes for more flexible systems.\n\nExperimental cross-correlation nitrogen Q-branch CARS thermometry in a spark ignition engine\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLockett, R. D.; Ball, D.; Robertson, G. N.\n\n2013-07-01\n\nA purely experimental technique was employed to derive temperatures from nitrogen Q-branch Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) spectra, obtained in a high pressure, high temperature environment (spark ignition Otto engine). This was in order to obviate any errors arising from deficiencies in the spectral scaling laws which are commonly used to represent nitrogen Q-branch CARS spectra at high pressure. The spectra obtained in the engine were compared with spectra obtained in a calibrated high pressure, high temperature cell, using direct cross-correlation in place of the minimisation of sums of squares of residuals. The technique is demonstrated through the measurement of air temperature as a function of crankshaft angle inside the cylinder of a motored single-cylinder Ricardo E6 research engine, followed by the measurement of fuel-air mixture temperatures obtained during the compression stroke in a knocking Ricardo E6 engine. A standard CARS programme (SANDIA's CARSFIT) was employed to calibrate the altered non-resonant background contribution to the CARS spectra that was caused by the alteration to the mole fraction of nitrogen in the unburned fuel-air mixture. The compression temperature profiles were extrapolated in order to predict the auto-ignition temperatures.\n\nBranching miter joints : principles and artwork\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nVerhoeff, T.; Verhoeff, K.; Hart, G.W.; Sarhangi, R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA miter joint connects two beams, typically of the same cross section, at an angle such that the longitudinal beam edges continue across the joint.

Surveying the history of rum production in the French Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this article contends that the reason why no regional trade in rum developed in French North America resulted from fierce industrial and institutional competition from brandy producers in metropolitan France. Rum, nevertheless, remained significant within the culture and economy of Native Americans and African Americans. This article seeks to add nuance to the wider debate of the ability of the trans-border diffusion of new ideas to stimulate and institutionalize industrial and economic growth in the Atlantic world. French entrepreneurs were no less âentrepreneurialâ than their British counterparts, but real constraints on consumption on both sides of the Atlantic created insufficient demand.\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE CROSS-CORRELATION AND TIME LAG OF 4U 1735-44 ALONG THE BRANCHES\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLei Yajuan; Zhang Haotong; Zhang Chengmin; Yuan Hailong; Dong Yiqiao; Zhao Yongheng; Zhang Yanxia; Qu Jinlu; Song Liming; Wang Dehua; Yin Hongxing\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe analyze the cross-correlation function between the soft and hard X-rays of atoll source 4U 1735-44 with RXTE data, and find anti-correlated soft and hard time lags of about a hecto-second. In the island state, the observations do not show any obvious correlations, and most observations of the banana branch show a positive correlation. However, anti-correlations are detected in the upper banana branch. These results are different from those of Z-sources (Cyg X-2, GX 5-1), where anti-correlations are detected in the horizontal branch and upper normal branch. In this case, the lag timescales of both this atoll and Z-sources are found to be similar, at a magnitude of several tens to hundreds of seconds. As a comparison, it is noted that anti-correlated lags lasting thousands of seconds have been reported from several black hole candidates in their intermediate states. In addition, for an observation containing four segments that show positive or anti-correlation, we analyze the spectral evolution with the hybrid model. In the observation, the anti-correlation is detected at the highest flux. The fitting results show that the Comptonized component is not the lowest at the highest flux, which suggests that the anti-correlation corresponds to the transition between the soft and hard states. Finally, we compare the corresponding results of atoll source 4U 1735-44 with those observed in Z-sources and black hole candidates, and the possible origins of the anti-correlated time lags are discussed\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE CROSS-CORRELATION AND TIME LAG OF 4U 1735-44 ALONG THE BRANCHES\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLei Yajuan; Zhang Haotong; Zhang Chengmin; Yuan Hailong; Dong Yiqiao; Zhao Yongheng; Zhang Yanxia [Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China); Qu Jinlu; Song Liming [Particle Astrophysics Center, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 (China); Wang Dehua [Astronomy Department, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875 (China); Yin Hongxing, E-mail: leiyjcwmy@163.com [School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University, Weihai 264209 (China)\n\n2013-09-15\n\nWe analyze the cross-correlation function between the soft and hard X-rays of atoll source 4U 1735-44 with RXTE data, and find anti-correlated soft and hard time lags of about a hecto-second.

After implanting vagus nerve electrodes to the cervical vagus nerve, side effects such as voice alterations and dyspnea or missing therapeutic effects are observed at different frequencies. Cervical vagus nerve branching might partly be responsible for these effects. However, vagus nerve branching has not yet been described in the context of vagus nerve stimulation.Branching of the cervical vagus nerve was investigated macroscopically in 35 body donors (66 cervical sides in the carotid sheath. After X-ray imaging for determining the vertebral levels of cervical vagus nerve branching, samples were removed to confirm histologically the nerve and to calculate cervical vagus nerve diameters and cross-sections.Cervical vagus nerve branching was observed in 29% of all cases (26% unilaterally, 3% bilaterally and proven histologically in all cases. Right-sided branching (22% was more common than left-sided branching (12% and occurred on the level of the fourth and fifth vertebra on the left and on the level of the second to fifth vertebra on the right side. Vagus nerves without branching were significantly larger than vagus nerves with branches, concerning their diameters (4.79 mm vs. 3.78 mm and cross-sections (7.24 mm2 vs. 5.28 mm2.Cervical vagus nerve branching is considerably more frequent than described previously. The side-dependent differences of vagus nerve branching may be linked to the asymmetric effects of the vagus nerve. Cervical vagus nerve branching should be taken into account when identifying main trunk of the vagus nerve for implanting electrodes to minimize potential side effects or lacking therapeutic benefits of vagus nerve stimulation.\n\nLinear and branched glyco-lipopeptide vaccines follow distinct cross-presentation pathways and generate different magnitudes of antitumor immunity.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOlivier Renaudet\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Glyco-lipopeptides, a form of lipid-tailed glyco-peptide, are currently under intense investigation as B- and T-cell based vaccine immunotherapy for many cancers. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of glyco-lipopeptides (GLPs immunogenicity and the position of the lipid moiety on immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GLPs remain to be determined.We have constructed two structural analogues of HER-2 glyco-lipopeptide (HER-GLP by synthesizing a chimeric peptide made of one universal CD4(+ epitope (PADRE and one HER-2 CD8(+ T-cell epitope (HER(420-429. The C-terminal end of the resulting CD4-CD8 chimeric peptide was coupled to a tumor carbohydrate B-cell epitope, based on a regioselectively addressable functionalized templates (RAFT, made of four alpha-GalNAc molecules. The resulting HER glyco-peptide (HER-GP was then linked to a palmitic acid moiety, attached either at the N-terminal end (linear HER-GLP-1 or in the middle between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes (branched HER-GLP-2. We have investigated the uptake, processing and cross-presentation pathways of the two HER-GLP vaccine constructs, and assessed whether the position of linkage of the lipid moiety would affect the B- and T-cell immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Immunization of mice revealed that the linear HER-GLP-1 induced a stronger and longer lasting HER(420-429-specific IFN-gamma producing CD8(+ T cell response, while the branched HER-GLP-2 induced a stronger tumor-specific IgG response. The linear HER-GLP-1 was taken up easily by dendritic cells (DCs, induced stronger DCs maturation and produced a potent TLR- 2-dependent T-cell activation. The linear and branched HER-GLP molecules appeared to follow two different cross-presentation pathways. While regression of established tumors was induced by both linear HER-GLP-1 and branched HER-GLP-2, the inhibition of tumor growth was significantly higher in HER-GLP-1 immunized mice (p<0.005.These findings have\n\nDy163-Ho163 branching: an s-process barometer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBeer, H.; Walter, G.; Macklin, R.L.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe neutron capture cross sections of Dy163 and Er164 have been measured to analyze the s-process branching at Dy163-Ho163. The reproduction of the s-process abundance of Er164 via this branching is sensitive to temperature kT, neutron density, and electron density n/sub e/. The calculations using information from other branchings on kT and the neutron density n/sub n/ give constraints for n/sub e/ at the site of the s-process\n\nCross-Section Measurement of the 169Tm(n,3n)167Tm Reaction and Constraining the Branching Ratio of 167Tm\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChampine, Brian; Gooden, Matthew; Thomas, Keenan; Krishichayan, F.; Norman, Eric; Scielzo, Nick; Tonchev, Anton; Tornow, Werner\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe cross section of the 169Tm(n,3n)167Tm reaction has been measured from 17.5 to 21.5 MeV using activation technique. This energy region was chosen to resolve the two different trends of the previous (n,3n) cross section measurements on 169Tm. In addition, the branching ratio of the 207.8 keV Î³-ray line stemming from electron capture of 167Tm was measured to be 0.419(16). The result of these measurements provide more accurate diagnostic estimation of the so called reaction-in-flight neutrons produced via the internal confinement fusion plasma in deuterium-tritium capsules at the National Ignition Facility.\n\nMeasurement of W-pair cross sections in $e^+ e^-$ interactions at $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 172 GeV and W decay branching fractions\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAcciarri, M;

In a data sample corresponding to a total luminosity of 10.25~pb$^{-1}$ we select 110 four-fermion events with pairs of hadronic jets or leptons with high invariant masses. Branching fractions of W decays into different fermion-antifermion pairs are determined with and without the assumption of charged-current lepton universality. The branching fraction for hadronic W decays is measured to be: $ B(\\\\mathrm{W\\\\rightarrow hadrons}) = 64.2^{+3.7}_{-3.8}~(stat.) \\\\pm 0.5~(syst.)~\\\\%$. Combining all final states the total cross section for W-pair production is measured to be: $\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{WW}} = 12.27^{+1.41}_{-1.32}~(stat.)\\\\pm0.23~(syst.)$~pb. The results are in good agreement with the Standard Model.\n\nMeasurement of the 169Tm (n ,3 n ) 167Tm cross section and the associated branching ratios in the decay of 167Tm\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChampine, B.; Gooden, M.

In 83.3% of cases, one of the main or secondary branches of the marginal mandibular nerve crosses superficial (lateral to the facial vessels. There are communications either between the main or the secondary branches of the marginal mandibular nerve itself in 53.6% of specimens and with the buccal branch of the facial nerve in 40%, also with the anterior branch of the great auricular nerve in 3.3%, and with the transverse cervical nerve in 3.3% of specimens. The relationship of the nerve to the lower border of the mandible at a point midway between the angle of the mandible and symphysis menti is variable; it is either totally above it in most of the specimens 80%, or below it in 10% or at it in the remaining 10% of the specimens. The branches that lie above the lower border of the mandible are always deep into the superficial layer of the parotid fascia, while those branches that lie below the lower border of the mandible are intrafascially. The termination of the nerve is deep into the muscles of the ipsilateral lower lip in all specimens.\n\nCorrelations in quantum systems and branch points in the complex plane\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRotter, I.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBranch points in the complex plane are responsible for avoided level crossings in closed and open quantum systems.

The molecules show branch-based fluorescence emission at low quantum yield. Ultrafast non-radiative decay on a picosecond time scale is found and is attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer bridged by the central triphenylamine.

Typically, the knowledge on the associated capture cross sections is very poor due to the difficulty in obtaining enough material of these radioactive isotopes and to measure the cross section of a sample with an intrinsic activity; indeed only 2 out o the 21 ${s}$-process branching points have ever been measured by using the time-of-flight method. In this experiment we aim at measuring for the first time the capture cross sections of $^{171}$Tm and $^{204}$Tl, both of crucial importance for understanding the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in AGB stars. The combination of both (n,$\\\\gamma$) measurements on $^{171}$Tm and $^{204}$Tl will allow one to accurately constrain neutron density and the strength of the 13C(Î±,n) source in low mass AGB stars. Additionally, the cross section of $^{204}$Tl is also of cosmo-chrono...\n\nAssessing allometric models to predict vegetative growth of mango (Mangifera indica; Anacardiaceae) at the current-year branch scale.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNormand, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Lauri, Pierre-Ãric\n\n2012-03-01\n\nAccurate and reliable predictive models are necessary to estimate nondestructively key variables for plant growth studies such as leaf area and leaf, stem, and total biomass. Predictive models are lacking at the current-year branch scale despite the importance of this scale in plant science. We calibrated allometric models to estimate leaf area and stem and branch (leaves + stem) mass of current-year branches, i.e., branches several months old studied at the end of the vegetative growth season, of four mango cultivars on the basis of their basal cross-sectional area. The effects of year, site, and cultivar were tested. Models were validated with independent data and prediction accuracy was evaluated with the appropriate statistics. Models revealed a positive allometry between dependent and independent variables, whose y-intercept but not the slope, was affected by the cultivar. The effects of year and site were negligible. For each branch characteristic, cultivar-specific models were more accurate than common models built with pooled data from the four cultivars. Prediction quality was satisfactory but with data dispersion around the models, particularly for large values. Leaf area and stem and branch mass of mango current-year branches could be satisfactorily estimated on the basis of branch basal cross-sectional area with cultivar-specific allometric models. The results suggested that, in addition to the heteroscedastic behavior of the variables studied, model accuracy was probably related to the functional plasticity of branches in relation to the light environment and/or to the number of growth units composing the branches.\n\nLegitimacy in Cross-Border Higher Education: Identifying Stakeholders of International Branch Campuses\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarrugia, Christine A.; Lane, Jason E.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWhen colleges and universities set up outposts such as international branch campuses (IBCs) in foreign countries, the literature suggests that the success of that outpost can be tied to its ability to build its own legitimacy.

In a PubMed search, the search terms \"facial,\" AND \"artery,\" AND \"classification OR variant OR pattern\" were used. The IBM SPSS Statistics 20 system was used for statistical analysis. Among the 500 titles, 18 articles were selected and reviewed systematically. Most of the articles focused on \"classification\" according to the \"terminal branch.\" Several authors classified the facial artery according to their terminal branches. Most of them, however, did not describe the definition of \"terminal branch.\" There were confusions within the classifications. When the inferior labial artery was absent, 3 different types were used. The \"alar branch\" or \"nasal branch\" was used instead of the \"lateral nasal branch.\" The angular branch was used to refer to several different branches. The presence as a percentage of each branch according to the branches in Gray's Anatomy (premasseteric, inferior labial, superior labial, lateral nasal, and angular) varied. No branch was used with 100% consistency. The superior labial branch was most frequently cited (95.7%, 382 arteries in 399 hemifaces). The angular branch (53.9%, 219 arteries in 406 hemifaces) and the premasseteric branch were least frequently cited (53.8%, 43 arteries in 80 hemifaces). There were significant differences among each of the 5 branches (P < 0.05) except between the angular branch and the premasseteric branch and between the superior labial branch and the inferior labial branch. The authors believe identifying the presence percentage of each branch will be helpful for surgical procedures.\n\nCra regulates the cross-talk between the two branches of the phosphoenolpyruvate : phosphotransferase system of Pseudomonas putida.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChavarrÃ­a, Max; Fuhrer, Tobias; Sauer, Uwe; PflÃ¼ger-Grau, Katharina; de Lorenzo, VÃ­ctor\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe gene that encodes the catabolite repressor/activator, Cra (FruR), of Pseudomonas putida is divergent from the fruBKA operon for the uptake of fructose via the phosphoenolpyruvate : carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS(Fru)). The expression of the fru cluster has been studied in cells growing on substrates that change the intracellular concentrations of fructose-1-P (F1P), the principal metabolic intermediate that counteracts the DNA-binding ability of Cra on an upstream operator. While the levels of the regulator were not affected by any of the growth conditions tested, the transcription of fruB was stimulated by fructose but not by the gluconeogenic substrate, succinate. The analysis of the P(fruB) promoter activity in a strain lacking the Cra protein and the determination of key metabolites revealed that this regulator represses the expression of PTS(Fru) in a fashion that is dependent on the endogenous concentrations of F1P. Because FruB (i.e. the EI-HPr-EIIA(Fru) polyprotein) can deliver a high-energy phosphate to the EIIA(Ntr) (PtsN) enzyme of the PTS(Ntr) branch, the cross-talk between the two phosphotransferase systems was examined under metabolic regimes that allowed for the high or low transcription of the fruBKA operon. While fructose caused cross-talk, succinate prevented it almost completely. Furthermore, PtsN phosphorylation by FruB occurred in a Îcra mutant regardless of growth conditions. These results traced the occurrence of the cross-talk to intracellular pools of Cra effectors, in particular F1P. The Cra/F1P duo seems to not only control the expression of the PTS(Fru) but also checks the activity of the PTS(Ntr) in vivo.

Data were obtained from 37 branches of 2 banking institutions in Ghana. Results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that branch-level HPWS relates to empowerment climate. Additionally, results of hierarchical linear modeling that examined the hypothesized cross-level relationships revealed 3 salient findings. First, experienced HPWS and empowerment climate partially mediate the influence of branch-level HPWS on psychological empowerment. Second, psychological empowerment partially mediates the influence of empowerment climate and experienced HPWS on service performance. Third, service orientation moderates the psychological empowerment-service performance relationship such that the relationship is stronger for those high rather than low in service orientation. Last, ordinary least squares regression results revealed that branch-level HPWS influences branch-level market performance through cross-level and individual-level influences on service performance that emerges at the branch level as aggregated service performance.\n\nWhat Drives Deregulation? Economics and Politics of the Relaxation of Bank Branching Restrictions\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRandall S. Kroszner; Philip E. Strahan\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the key forces behind deregulation in order to assess the relative importance of alternative theories of regulatory entry and exit. We focus on bank branching deregulation across the states which began a quarter century ago and cumulated in federal deregulation in 1994. The cross-sectional and time-series variation of branching deregulation allows us to develop a hazard model to explain the timing of deregulation across the states using proxies motivated by private-interes...\n\nTurbulent penetration in T-junction branch lines with leakage flow\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKickhofel, John, E-mail: kickhofel@lke.mavt.ethz.ch; Valori, Valentina, E-mail: v.valori@tudelft.nl; Prasser, H.-M., E-mail: prasser@lke.mavt.ethz.ch\n\n2014-09-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ New T-junction facility designed for adiabatic high velocity ratio mixing studies. â¢ Trends in scalar mixing RMS and average in branch line presented and discussed. â¢ Turbulent penetration has unique power spectrum relevant to thermal fatigue. â¢ Forced flow oscillations translate to peaks in power spectrum in branch line. - Abstract: While the study of T-junction mixing with branch velocity ratios of near 1, so called cross flow mixing, is well advanced, to the point of realistic reactor environment fluidâstructure interaction experiments and CFD benchmarking, turbulent penetration studies remain an under-researched threat to primary circuit piping. A new facility has been constructed for the express purpose of studying turbulent penetration in branch lines of T-junctions in the context of the high cycle thermal fatigue problem in NPPs. Turbulent penetration, which may be the result of a leaking valve in a branch line or an unisolable branch with heat losses, induces a thermal cycling region which may result in high cycle fatigue damage and failures. Leakage flow experiments have been performed in a perpendicular T-junction in a horizontal orientation with 50 mm diameter main pipe and branch pipe at velocity ratios (main/branch) up to 400. Wire mesh sensors are used as a means of measuring the mixing scalar in adiabatic tests with deionized and tap water. The near-wall region of highest scalar fluctuations is seen to vary circumferentially and in depth in the branch a great deal depending on the velocity ratio. The power spectra of the mixing scalar in the region of turbulent penetration are found to be dominated by high amplitude fluctuations at low frequencies, of particular interest to thermal fatigue. Artificial velocity oscillations in the main pipe manifest in the mixing spectra in the branch line in the form of a peak, the magnitude of which grows with increasing local RMS.\n\nBranched polynomial covering maps\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHansen, Vagn Lundsgaard\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA Weierstrass polynomial with multiple roots in certain points leads to a branched covering map.

The molar ratio between the monomers is a crucial parameter that rules the gelation process. Nevertheless, the concentration of monomers in the solvent phase plays a key role as well. Hyper-branched Î²-cyclodextrin-based polymers were obtained performing the syntheses with excess of solvent and cross-linking agent, and the conditions for critical dilution were determined experimentally. A hyper-branched polymer with very high water solubility was obtained and fully characterized both as for its chemical structure and for its capability to encapsulate substances. Fluorescein was used as probe molecule to test the complexation properties of the new material.\n\nProspects for direct neutron capture measurements on s-process branching point isotopes\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGuerrero, C.; Lerendegui-Marco, J.; Quesada, J.M.

[Goethe-Universitaet Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main (Germany)\n\n2017-05-15\n\nThe neutron capture cross sections of several unstable key isotopes acting as branching points in the s-process are crucial for stellar nucleosynthesis studies, but they are very challenging to measure directly due to the difficult production of sufficient sample material, the high activity of the resulting samples, and the actual (n, Î³) measurement, where high neutron fluxes and effective background rejection capabilities are required. At present there are about 21 relevant s-process branching point isotopes whose cross section could not be measured yet over the neutron energy range of interest for astrophysics. However, the situation is changing with some very recent developments and upcoming technologies. This work introduces three techniques that will change the current paradigm in the field: the use of Î³-ray imaging techniques in (n, Î³) experiments, the production of moderated neutron beams using high-power lasers, and double capture experiments in Maxwellian neutron beams.

We can optimize an entanglement branching operator by solving a minimization problem based on squeezing operators. The entanglement branching is a new useful operation to manipulate a tensor network. For example, finding a particular entanglement structure by an entanglement branching operator, we can improve a higher-order tensor renormalization group method to catch a proper renormalization flow in a tensor network space. This new method yields a new type of tensor network states. The second example is a many-body decomposition of a tens"
