        "text": "GARMISCH — PARTENKIR CHEN, Germany, Aug. 17 (AP) —Field Marshal Siegmund Wil helm List, whose forces cracked the French Maginot Line in May, 1940, died today. He was 91 years old.\n\nMarshal List's 12th Army broke through the Maginot Line between. Sedan and Mdzi tres in the great World War II assault that ended with the fall of France.\n\nBlitzkrieg Expert\n\nField Marshal List was the Nazi blitzkrieg expert in World War II.\n\nAs the outstanding practi tioner of “lightning war,” he led forces that cracked the French Maginot Line, that surged into Austria, that in vaded Bohemia and Moravia, that besieged Russia. He was one of Germany's foremost emergency generals, resourceful and ruthless.\n\nHe was so close to Hitler that he was often viewed as the dictator's “personal repre sentative.” His movements were scrupulously reported in the Allied press, and sometimes interpreted in military circles as indicating preparation for a new military offensive.\n\nMarshal List's war career lasted somewhat over two years until Sept. 10, 1942. Hav ing concluded that further military operations in southern Russia were fruitless, he re signed his command there.\n\nMarshal List retired to Gar misch‐Partenkirchen, where on May 1, 1945, he was captured by the United States's Seventh Army at the same time as Admiral Nicholas Horthy, for mer Regent of Hungary, and Field Marshal General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb.\n\nHe stood trial for war crimes at Nuremberg, charged with issuing an order to punish resistance in Greece and Yugo slavia “not by legal prosecu tion of the guilty but by spread ing terror and applying Dracon ic measures.”\n\nAt the trial he betrayed not a trace of nervousness and at one point even warned the United States to avoid hazard ous fighting in the southeastern countries of Europe.\n\n“May kind fate protect the nation that is trying us from a fight like ours in the Bal kans,” he said.\n\nHis sentence, handed down Feb. 19, 1948, was life impris onment—a severer punishment than those received by any of the 11 generals with whom he was tried. On Christmas Day, 1952, he was released from the American war crimes prison at Landsberg on a medical parole at the age of 72.\n\nDarkly handsome, with dark eyebrows and a square mus tache somewhat like the Filh rer's, the field marshal was in command of the southern Ger man army in Poland at the start of the war.\n\n‘The Balkan Conqueror’\n\nLater he took command of the 12th Army, which smashed the Maginot Line, previously thought to be impenetrable. A year later he prepared the Ger man campaign against Greece. Subsequently his troops broke through the Metaxas Line, occupied Salonika and on April 25, 11941 entered Athens.\n\nIn a display of military might, his troops marched through the capital, past thou sands of silent Greeks. The “Balkan conqueror” watched from in front of the Royal Pal ace in the heart of the city as heavy motored vehicles raised a din and formations marched by for more than two hours.\n\nThe “Balkan conqueror” gained his name as the guiding mind of the Balkan campaign. After the occupation of Bul garia, he had moved his head quarters from Bucharest to Sofia and supervised the at tacks on both Greece and Yugo slavia from Bulgaria.\n\nIn the summer of 1942 he be came one of four Army gener als operating in Russia; he re ceived the command in the Caucasus section, which had been under General Field Mar shal Fedor von Bock. Field Marshal List met stiff enemy resistance and difficult fighting terrain—craggy tundra, river gorges, dense woods and moun tains. Soon after, he announced his retirement."
