It will keep the same format as my BoB thread and the Day by Day Europe thread but I will be adding pics that were taken on the day in question. I ask that anybody wanting to contribute please PM me and I can add your information to that day.\n\nI will do my best to make this as accurate as possible without any personal opinion but some may sneak through. Understand that much of this information I am taking from a failed book venture I started 15 years ago on a Day by Day account of the Luftwaffe so if it seems very German oriented I apologize. But again, I will do my best to be objective.\n\nAgain, I am listing my sources and will be adding as the days go on.

Comrades! For weeks and months past, with clenched fists and gritted teeth, you have had to endure the outrages and unbelievable provocations which a so-called state, itself a product of the insanity of the Treaty of Versailles, has had the affrontery to offer the Greater German Reich. Now the cup is full. The German people can no longer tolerate the criminal activities to which hundreds and thousands of our fellow countrymen in the former German eastern provinces have already fallen victim. Any further hesitation would be tantamount to abandoning the holy rights of the German nation.\"\n\n\"The Fuhrer has called. Your hour of greatness has arrived. The Luftwaffe – for many years past the most effective instrument in the Fuhrer's political pursuance of peace – must now demonstrate its readiness, at this decisive moment, to fulfill the enormous tasks being asked of it. The trust, which the Fuhrer and the German people have placed in you, knows no bounds. As your Commander-in-Chief I am both proud and happy, for I know with rock-like certainty that each and every one of you will be worthy of that trust in every way.\"\n\n\"Aircrew! With lightning-fast attacks you will destroy the enemy, wherever he stands to fight, or whether he will be in full retreat. With your selfless devotion to duty you will wear down and crush all resistance.\"\n\n\"Comrades! I look each one of you straight in the eye and charge every single one of you to give his all for Volk and Fatherland. At your head our beloved Fuhrer, behind you the entire German nation united in national socialism. For us there can be only one solution. Victory!\"\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Generalfeldmarschall Hermann Göring\n\nPOLAND: The Luftwaffe begins the Second World War at 0426 hours when Junkers Ju.87 'Stuka' dive bombers of 3./StG 1, led by Oblt. Bruno Dilley, bomb the railway bridge over the Vistula River at Dirscham. Dilley's mission is to sever the detonation cables that the Poles have wired to blow the bridge in case of attack. If the bridge is blown up then the ground assault will be delayed. Although the Stukas are able to cut some of the wires it doesn't prevent the Poles from blasting the bridge.\n\nAt 0445 hours, Germany formally invades Poland on the pretext of Polish aggression on German soil (dead \"Poles\" are German prisoners dressed in Polish uniforms shot). The German battleship \"Schleswig-Holstein\" fires the first naval shots of WWII and shells the fortress guarding the port of Danzig. The heavily wooded Westerplatte peninsula had been a popular park but now contained an ammunition depot. The Polish garrison of only 182, armed mainly with machine guns and mortars, was to make a heroic stand, fighting against overwhelming odds for over a week.\n\nThe Germans allot 52 divisions for the invasion (some 1.5 million men), including the 6 armored divisions and all their motorized units. The Wehrmacht cross the frontier at several points under the command of General Walther von Brauchitsch, divided into two Heeresgruppen, Heeesgruppe Nord commanded by General Fedor von Bock, and Heeesgruppe Sud commanded by General Karl Rudolf von Rundstedt. The individual armies are commanded by General's Günther von Kluge, 4.Armee; Georg von Küchler, 3.Armee; Wilhelm von List, 14. Armee; Walter von Reichenau, 10.Armee; and Johannes Blaskowitz, 8.Armee and the armoured formations are commanded by general Heinz Guderian, XIX Corps, Erich Hoepner, XVI Corps, and Paul von Kleist, XXII Corps. Simultaneously the Luftwaffe have two Luftflottes in service; Luftflotte 1 commanded by Albert Kesselring, and Luftflotte 4 command by Alexander Löhr, , which have around 1,600 aircraft. Heeresgruppe Sud, advancing from Silesia, is to provide the main German attacks. The 8.Armee on the left is to move toward Poznan, the principal thrust is to be delivered by 10.Armee which is to advance in the center to the Vistula River between Warsaw and Sandomierz, while 14.Armee on the right moves toward Krakow and the Carpathian flank. The 4.Armee from East Prussia is to move south toward Warsaw and the line to the Bug River to the east; 3.Armee is to cross the Polish Corridor and join 4.Armee in moving south.\n\nClassic blitzkrieg tactics of dive bombers, fast moving panzers and armored infantry divisions decimate the unsuspecting Polish forces on the borders. The Poles have 23 regular infantry divisions prepared with 7 more assembling, 1 weak armored division and an inadequate supply of artillery. They also have a considerable force of cavalry. The reserve units were only called up on August 30th and are not ready for combat. Heavy bombers damage major Polish cities (panicking the citizens) and destroy airfields, railways and bridges, plus railway stations full of mobilizing Polish soldiers. In the air, almost all the 500 Polish planes are obsolete and prove unable to blunt the impact of the German attack. The Polish Air Force is mostly destroyed on the ground. But at Mokra, near Częstochowa, the German 4.Panzerdivision attacked two regiments of the Wolynska Cavalry Brigade. The Polish defenders drew the Germans into a tank trap and destroyed over 50 tanks and armored cars.\n\nThe Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal Rydz-Smigly, has deployed the stronger parts of his army in the northwestern half of the country, including large forces in the Poznan area and the Polish Corridor. He hopes to hold the Germans to only gradual gains.\n\n1 September 1939 continued.....\n\nThe battle in the Polish Corridor was especially intense. It was here that the myth of the Polish cavalry charging German tanks was born. As Gen. Heinz Guderian's panzer and motorized forces pressed the weaker Polish forces back, a unit of Pomorska Cavalry Brigade slipped through German lines late in the day on Sept. 1 in an effort to counterattack and slow the German advance. The unit happened on a German infantry battalion making camp. The Polish cavalry mounted a saber charge, sending the Germans fleeing. At that moment, a group of German armored cars arrived on the scene and opened fire on the cavalry, killing several troopers and forcing the rest to retreat. Nazi propagandists made this into \"cavalry charging tanks\" and even made a movie to embellish their claims. While historians remembered the propaganda, they forgot that on September 1, Gen. Guderian had to personally intervene to stop the German 20th Motorized Division from retreating under what it described as \"intense cavalry pressure.\" This pressure was being applied by the Polish 18th Lancer Regiment, a unit one tenth its size.\n\nAt 0445 hours, Lt. Frank Neubert of I./StG 2 \"Immelmann\", scores the first aerial victory of the war when he shoots down a PZL 11 of the No. 121 Eskadra (Polish Fighter Squadron) over Balice. Lt. Neubert and his kette of Stukas were attacking the airfield at Krakow when the Polish fighter crossed in front of him and Capt. Medwecki, the Commanding Officer of the Cracow Army Fighter Wing was killed. 2nd Lt. Wladyslaw Gnys managed to evade the attack, and damage one of the Stukas. A few minutes later, having climbed, he attacked two Dornier 17E's of KG 77 returning from a raid on Cracow, scoring several hits on each of them. After his second dive, he lost visual contact with them and returned to the airfield not knowing that he had just scored the first two victories over the Luftwaffe in World War 2. The two German bombers collided after his attack and fell to the ground near the village of Zurada.\n\nOne hour later, bombers of III./KG 3 bomb the town of Dirschau. Fog delays the great offensive blow by the Luftwaffe so much that only six Gruppen of bombers from Luftflotte 1 make it off the ground all morning.\n\nDue to the fog, at 0550 hours Generalfeldmarschall Göring cancels \"Operation SEASIDE\", a concentrated attack by every Geschwader on the Polish capital, Warsaw. One Gruppe of bombers from II./LG 1 do make the flight and raid the hangers and factories of the PZL aircraft works outside Warsaw.\n\nThe Luftwaffe's second Lehrgeschwader, Major Hanns Trübenbach's I(J)./LG 2 flying Bf 109s begin the day several hours late because of the fog. At 1000 hours they fly the first of four escort missions for the day but encounter no Polish aircraft. Henschel Hs 123 biplanes of II./LG 2 take off at dawn from Altsiedel airfield to attack the village of Panki (Pryzstain) just ahead of the German 10.Armee. This is the first instance in World War II of direct support by the Luftwaffe of an attack by ground troops.\n\nAlarmed by the well-organized network of observation posts, the Pursuit Brigade in full force (52 aircraft) intercepted a large formation of He 111 bombers from KG 27 escorted by Bf 110s of I./LG 1. Gruppenkommandeur Hptm. Martin Mettig tries to contact the bombers by setting off a flare but the flare malfunctions, going off in his cockpit. Wounded in the hand and thigh and blinded by the smoke, he jettisons the canopy which takes off his aerial mast and antenna. Unable to contact the bombers he is forced to return to his base at Rostken. Several pilots follow their Gruppenkommandeur back to base. The rest of the fighter formation continues and make claims for four Polish PZL 11 fighters, including the first victory for Lt. Gustav Rödel. No Messerschmitts are lost from the Gruppe during the dogfight. As a result of the well-executed attack, six He 111s were shot down at the expense of one actual P.11c, which crashed during a forced landing. What was supposed to be Der Spaziergang uber Warshau – a 'stroll over Warsaw' – turned into a bitter escape for the Luftwaffe bomber crews. During the fighting, 2nd Lt. Borowski of 113 Eskadra shot down a stray Bf 109, which became the first aircraft of that type destroyed in World War 2.\n\nAt 1100 hours Generalmajor Freiherr von Richthofen, the Commander-in –Chief of the air support forces, takes off in a Fiesler Storch to survey the action around Panki. Flying too low he is shot at by Polish ground forces and barely makes it back to friendly lines.\n\nThe Luftwaffe concentrates on hitting Polish hangers and runways, aircraft dispersal areas and aviation factories. During the day bombers from KG 1 raid the Polish naval air base at Putzig-Rahmel, KG 152 bombs the flak defenses and petrol dumps at the airfield at Thorn, KG 26 destroys buildings and rail installations at Posen-Luwica, KG 53 attacks runways and hangers at Gnesen and II./KG 3 hit an ammunition dump south of Graudenz. Stukas of I./StG 76, led by Hptm. Walther Sigel, raid the airfield at Wielun and those of StG 77 attack the Lublinitz airfield.\n\nOne unique unit operating on the Polish front, TrGr 186 (a unit of the naval Tragergruppe [carrier wing] for the unfinished aircraft carrier 'Graf Zeppelin') is unable to carry out a planned aerial cover of the German World War I battleship 'Schleswig-Holstein' sitting in Danzig's Harbour Canal because of the mist and fog. The unit has a mix of two Staffeln of Bf 109s and one of Ju 87 Stukas. The Messerschmitt Staffeln instead fly escort missions for the Stuka Staffel.\n\n01 SEPTEMBER 1939\n\nUBOATS\n\nArrivals\n\nKiel: U-32, u-35\n\nDepartures\n\nWilhelmshaven: U-20\n\nAt Sea 1 September 1939\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nBaltic\n\nThe first shots of the war were fired by German battleship SCHLESWIG HOLSTEIN at the Polish Gdansk (Danzig) fortifications of Westerplatte. She had arrived six days earlier when Hitler seized the Polish port of Gdansk for Germany, renaming it Danzig.\n\nNear sister SCHLESIEN\n\nGerman naval forces–\n\nFor the invasion of Poland were under the Command of Naval Group Command East (Adm Conrad Albrecht):\n\nCommander Reconnaissance Force (Vice Adm Hermann Densch) had under his command CLs KÖLN, LEIPZIG, NÜRNBERG.\n\nOfficer Commanding Torpedo Boats (Konter Adm Gunther Lutjens) commanded DDs BERND VON ARNIM, BRUNO HEINEMANN, ERICH STEINBRINCK, FRIEDRICH ECKHOLDT, FRIEDRICH IHN, GEORG THIELE, LEBERECHT MAAS, RICHARD BEITZEN, WOLFGANG ZENKER and S-Boat flotilla 1 with S.10, S.11, S.12, S.13, S.18, S.19 and depot ship TSINGTAU.\n\nBRUNO HEINEMANN had a water feed pump break down and was forced to withdraw for repairs at Wilhelmshaven.\n\nOfficer Commanding MSWs (KptzS Friedrich Ruge in old torpedo boat T.196) commanded escort ships F.7, F.8, F.9, F.10, MSWFlot 1 with MSWs M.1, M.3, M.4, M.5, M.7, M.111, M.132, the Experimental Barrage Command with old MSWs ARKONA, NAUTILUS, OTTO BRAUN, PELIKAN, SUNDEWALL and MSW Flot 3 with coastal MSWs R.33, R.34, R.35, R.36, R.38, R.39, R.40.\n\nUboats committed to the attack included U.5, U.6, U.7, U.14, U.18, U.22, U.31, U.32, U.35, U.57.\n\nUnder the control of U-boats East (FKpt Oskar Schomburg). U.5, U.6, and U.7 patrolled the Kattegat near Laeso. U.22 patrolled inside the Irben Strait.\n\nU.31, U.32, U.35 were off the Gulf of Danzig for minelaying and U.14 and U.18 on patrol off the Gulf of Danzig.\n\nU.57 patrolled off Libau.\n\nPolish naval operations –\n\nThe Polish Fleet (prefix ORP) sortied from Gdynia, but not before the loss of TB MAZUR (ORP 340 grt)sunk in German air attacks.

GRYF was forced to jettison her mines to prevent the explosion of those still on deck and was unable to begin Exercise RURKA.

This seems to point to there being no protection for merchant shipping as yet further out to sea. It is not possible to bring the boats up yet, as on the orders of Naval War Staff, they may not leave their waiting positions.\n\nSupreme Command of the Navy abandoned the idea of using the recovery vessels at present with the U-boat school as S/M chasers under Group Baltic, after I had made representations. The vessels are urgently needed in Neustadt for training.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nBaltic\n\nOn the 2nd, U.22 and U.57 were withdrawn to provide relief for the other patrols.

There was concerns that remaining Polish forces in the Baltic might run amok in the vital Baltic sea trade routes\n\nU.31, U.32, and U.35 were in the Baltic near Hela to mine the approaches to the Gulf of Danzig. However, the escape of the Polish destroyers made (Operation \"Peking\" ) rendered these operations unnecessary and they were transferred from the Baltic to the Atlantic, first arriving at Wilhelmshaven. From there:\n\nU.32 set out on patrol on the 5th,\n\nU.31 and U.35 on the 9th,\n\nU.31 and U.35 were ordered to patrol areas west and south of England, respectively, and U.32 to lay mines off the Bristol Channel on the 17th.\n\nML GYDNIA (ORP 538 grt) was attacked and sunk by stukas from IV / LG.1 in the Gulf of Gdansk . At approximately around 1130 hrs the ship was anchored in the Bay of Puck approx. 2-3 nautical miles from Jastarnia. With approximately 100 people on board were killed. 35-40, including the commander, who died in hospital The precise numbers of casualties is not known because of the lossof ship documentation regarding the number of persons aboard..\n\nML GDANSK (ORP 538 grt) was also sunk at the same time.\n\nORP SS SEP unsuccessfully attacked German DD FRIEDRICH IHN at 1238 with one torpedo, north of Heisternest.

The local escort returned to Brest on the 3rd.\n\nML LA TOUR D'AUVERGNE (former PLUTON), also at Brest, sailed with the Force de Raid to lay a defensive minefield off the Moroccan coast. She was detached on the 4th and arrived, unescorted, at Casablanca on the 5th, where she remained until her loss on the 13th.\n\nFrench movements to an extent were driven by a fear of LW attacks on their fleet bases. When intelligence revealed the threat did not exist, the operations were cancelled and the forces arrived back at Brest on the 6th. They received an additional escort from the DesDiv 4 with DDs BOURRASQUE, ORAGE, OURAGAN, which dep Brest on the 5th.\n\nMed/Biscay\n\nFr Bat Sqn 2 with BBs PROVENCE, BRETAGNE, LORRAINE with nine DDs of DesFlot 1 dep Toulon 31 August, arrived at Oran on the 2nd.

Krakow is now near the front line. In the north, 4.Armee (Kluge) makes contact with the 3.Armee (Kuchler) from East Prussia. Two Polish divisions are destroyed while attempting to pull back through the Corridor. The Polish regular troops have been stationed too far forward so the German advance is soon in their rear areas, preventing movement of reserves and completely dislocating any communication left unscathed by the repeated German air strikes in support of the ground forces. There are 6 air raids on Warsaw.\n\nThe Luftwaffe continues its mission from the day before – destroying the Polish air force on the ground. By the end of the day the OKW issues its report for the day with these words:\n\n\"All aircraft existing in hangers or in the open were set on fire. From this it can be assumed that the Polish air force has received a mortal blow. The German Luftwaffe has won undisputed mastery over the whole of Poland.\"\n\nAnd the legend of the Stuka dive-bomber is made. With remarkable precision forty Stukas of I./StG 2 and I./StG 76 destroy the railway station of Piotrkow at the very moment Polish troops are detraining. The Stukas of StG 77 launch attacks on enemy columns near Radomsko. The Gulf of Danzig is revisited by Stukas from IV./LG 1 and sink the Polish ships 'Gdynie' and 'Gdansk'.\n\nHptm. Hannes Gentzen, Gruppenkommandeur of Jagdgruppe (JGr) 102 and the highest scoring pilot of the Polish campaign, scores his first victory,\n\n\"I was leading the Staffel near Lodz at about 1,000 meters and widely echeloned when we spotted two Polish fighters ahead of us, one at a higher altitude. I myself attacked the nearest Pole. My shots must have hit his motor because he immediately started to glide downwards. We followed close on his tail and discovered to our amazement that the spot where he obviously intended to land was a well-camouflaged airfield. We would never have discovered it had we not come down so low, but at this altitude we could clearly make out a row of five enemy bombers, their green-brown camouflage blending perfectly with the earth of the field.\n\n\"Meanwhile the aircraft I had damaged nosed over on landing and burst into flames. The pilot jumped out and ran for cover. We flew over the line of bombers at low level shooting them up. They too went up in flames. Then we spotted a suspicious looking haystack right in the middle of the field. Could it conceal a fuel tanker? Another strafing run. They hay started to burn and revealed four brown-painted fighters hidden underneath. They also caught fire as ground crew ran in all directions like a disturbed ants' nest.\n\n\"All this took place on the outskirts of Lodz, right in the middle of some allotments. We must have put on quite an air display for the local citizens!\n\n\"In the meantime, the other Pole who had been circling above us, spiraled down on one of my comrades, who evaded him and banked away. The Pole was then attacked and shot down by the others.\"\n\nJGr 102 led by Oblt. Waldemar von Roon, was a temporary fighter squadron, originally a Zerstörergruppen flying Bf 110's but equipped with Bf 109's for Polish action. On the return flight to their base at Gross-Stein, the Messerschmitts come upon four Polish bombers and shoot them down also. JGr 102's tally for the day is sixteen aircraft destroyed - two fighters and five bombers shot from the sky and four fighters and five bombers destroyed on the ground.\n\nIn the afternoon, about twenty Bf 110s of I./ZG 2 clash with six Polish PZL 11 fighters. Two Polish fighters are shot down, one by Lt. Helmut Lent - his first victory - and another by Lt. Nagel, but the Gruppe loses three of their own.\n\nThe Messerschmitts and Stukas of the Staffeln of TrGr 186 fly two more missions for the day before the Bf 109s are withdrawn to Gutenfeld in East Prussia.\n\nGERMANY: A new heavy fighter-bomber, the Messerschmitt Me 210 – designed to replace the Bf 110 - makes its first flight. Chief test pilot, Dr. Hermann Wurster, after flying the Me 210 V-1, code D-AABF, states that the new aircraft possesses very poor flying characteristics.\n\nIn an effort to bolster its Western front forces, the Luftwaffe moves Oberst Gerd von Massow's Stab./JG 2 and Oblt. Carl Vieck's I./JG 2 from Fürstenwalde to a new airfield at Döberitz.\n\nThe Germans began the construction of Stutthof Concentration Camp with labor of 65,000 Polish Christians.\n\nGermany annexed the Free City of Danzig. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier issued a joint ultimatum to Germany, demanding the withdraw of troops from Poland within 12 hours. Adolf Hitler advised the United Kingdom and France that he would withdraw from Poland if allowed to keep Danzig and the Polish corridor. The German government announces that Norwegian neutrality will be respected, provided that Britain and France do the same. Hitler rejects an offer to mediate the German-Polish dispute, made by Mussolini on August 31st and the proposal for a peace conference.\n\nWESTERN FRONT: The British RAF Advanced Air Striking Force arrives in France. Some 10 bomber squadrons are involved in the deployment.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3 September 1939 Sunday\n\nPOLAND: Britain and France declare war on Germany. At 0900 hours, British Ambassador in Germany Nevile Henderson delivered the British declaration of war to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, effective at 1100 hours; British Commonwealth nations of New Zealand and Australia followed suit. France would also declare war later on this day, effective at 1700 hours. In the afternoon, Adolf Hitler issued an order to his generals; again stressing that German troops must not attack British and French positions. Finally, Hitler also sent a message to the Soviet Union, asking the Soviets to jointly invade Poland.\n\nThe Polish Lodz Army is now in retreat after being beaten in the frontier battles with Heeresgruppe Sud. By 3 September, when Günther von Kluge in the north had reached the Vistula River (some 10 km (6.2 mi) from the German border at that time) and Georg von Küchler was approaching the Narew River, Walther von Reichenau's (10.Armee) armor was already beyond the Warta river. 14.Armee (General List) troops are converging on Krakow. The city of Czestochowa falls to German forces. Some Polish units penetrate into East Prussia but their position becomes untenable as German forces cut them off to the south. The Polish air force ceases to exist as an effective fighting element. In Warsaw, there are pro-British demonstrations.\n\n55 Polish peasants at Truskolasy, Poland were executed.\n\nHptm. Gentzen scores two more victories - two Polish PZL 11 fighters - bringing his total to three kills. Two of Hptm. Gentzen's fellow pilots at ZG 2 score their first victories against Polish aircraft. Oblt. Josef Kellner-Steinmetz of 3./ZG 2 destroys a PZL 23 2 km south east of Strzoikow while Lt. Reinhold Meßner, also of 3./ZG 2 downs a PZL 23 over Przysiela. On a Freie jagd over Tschenstochau, a half dozen Bf 109's of I./JG 76 overtake three PZL 23 Karas light bombers over Petrikau. Diving to the attack, the Bf 109s overshoot the bombers and have to try a second time. With the Polish bombers dropping almost to ground level, the second attack also overshoots the Polish targets. On the third pass, the Messerschmitts lower their flaps and slow their speed. Lt. Rudolf Ziegler of the Stab I./JG 76 shoots one down from a height of only 30 meters from the ground. Uffz. Willi Lohrer of 3./JG 76 also downs one of the Polish bombers for his first score of the war. Dietrich Hrabak, Staffelkapitän of I./JG 76 is hit by return fire from the two remaining Polish bombers and crash lands but returns to friendly lines. The same problem faced Lt. Karl-Gottfried Nordmann of I./JG 77 who destroys a PZL 23 Karas bomber by lowering his under-carriage, but not his flaps, so as not to overshoot his target. The bomber goes down in flames near the Wielum–Prosna area.\n\nIn an air battle over Warsaw, thirty PZL 11 Polish fighters engage fighters of I./LG 1 and lose five aircraft while the Gruppe loses only one warplane. But the Polish are not running from battle as several fighters from the Polish \"Army of Lodz\" are able to shoot down a number of German army observation planes.\n\nThe Stukas of 4(st)./TrGr 186 fly missions over the harbour at Hela and continue their success against Polish shipping. The Stukas of Karl-Herrmann \"Charly\" Lion and Oblt. Rummel score hits on the destroyer 'Wicher' and the minesweeper ' Mewa', sinking both ships. Later in the day the unit transfers to Gutenfeld in East Prussia."
