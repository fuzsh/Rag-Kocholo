Joining West from the Contributors Committee are Doug Collins - a former head coach with the Chicago Bulls in the late 1980s who later led the Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards, and Philadelphia 76ers - and Herb Simon, the owner of the Indiana Pacers franchise since 1983 and the Indiana Fever since their inception in 2000.\n\nThe 2024 class will be announced on April 6, with enshrinement weekend set for August 16-17."
