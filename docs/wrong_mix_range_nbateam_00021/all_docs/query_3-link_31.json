        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers are looking for any small bit of success to brighten their off-season. Coming off of a 21-win campaign, they’re focused on the 2024 NBA Draft and promises of next year. Among the questions to be answered is whether their current head coach, Chauncey Billups, will still be at the helm in October. Indications are that he will fulfill the last remaining guaranteed year of his contract, but rumors yesterday linked him with a potential exit and other jobs. Not coincidentally, those rumors provided inspiration for today’s Blazer’s Edge Mailbag question.\n\nDave,\n\nI’m excited to hear rumors that we might be “losing” our coach. I hope these rumors are true. I tried to be fair but I can’t stand another season. What do you think the honest strengths and weaknesses of Billups are? I can’t stand his press conferences in particular. I can’t go another season hearing all the reasons we lost delivered in a monotone.\n\nParker\n\nAs I’ve said all along, it’s hard to determine strengths and weaknesses of a coach whose team is incomplete and, frankly, not suited to compete. I believe it’s time for Billups to go, but that’s more in an Ecclesiastes/Byrds “To Everything There Is a Season” sense rather than a condemnation of him as a coach in particular. You can only lose so long before a change needs to happen for everyone. Coach Billups is on the cusp of that moment, if not embroiled in it.\n\nAs far as strengths, I’d list communication among his strong suits, also player rapport. Billups appears to have an easy way with the people around him. His brain works in straight lines and he can describe them. He’s also pretty ceaseless in coaching his charges during games. He’s always talking to someone about something. His players appear to accept him. Several have complimented him as a coach.\n\nSystemic and situational factors are weaknesses, as far as I can see. I can sketch out the beginnings of Portland’s defensive schemes but I’ll be damned if I know what they’re supposed to look like after the second pass. If Billups is good at communicating with players, he doesn’t seem to be able to get them to communicate with each other. Often Portland’s offense devolved into simple screens and kick-outs, easy to read and dead-ended before they started. I also found myself wondering at several points whether timeouts and challenges were coming at the right spots. Even basic clock management appeared to be a struggle before the Blazers started losing so markedly that it stopped mattering.\n\nI know Coach Billups takes flak for post-game press conferences. We’ve covered a few, so I understand the angst, but I’m willing to give him a pass for most of that. There are only so many ways to describe a loss. Those descriptions are interesting and insightful the first five times you hear them. After that, they wear thin. Billups had to describe five losses last season, then fifty-six more on top of them. At a certain point, what do you want? “Hey, we suck like a week-old sushi burrito. Next question.”\n\nThe most important measure of Billups’ effect on the team right now is player development. The jury’s still out on that one. If he stays another year, Scoot Henderson, Shaedon Sharpe, and the rookies will be his litmus test. If they’re looking great by season’s end, there’ll be little reason to complain no matter what the record. If we’re still up in the air about them, the wasted year will sting.\n\nThat’s about as fair as a summary as I can give. Some days I feel more knee-jerk inclinations that he should go. Other days I see rays of hope. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. With a bad team, though, the middle isn’t where you want to be. Progress is the only thing that matters, and we’re still waiting to see it from the Blazers and their coach."
