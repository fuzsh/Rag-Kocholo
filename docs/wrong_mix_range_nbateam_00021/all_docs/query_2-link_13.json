        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - Shams Charania of the Athletic reports that Chauncey Billups and Vince Carter will be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame class of 2024.\n\nBillups has been eligible since 2018 but “Mr. Big Shot” has been passed up since then, until now. He’s a Colorado guy through and through. Graduating from George Washington High School and was named Colorado Mr. Basketball three times. He then chose to play for the Colorado Buffaloes at the next level and averaged 18.5 points, 5.1 assists and 5.6 rebounds per game. His #4 jersey has since been retired by CU.\n\nAfter two seasons at CU he was drafted third overall to the Boston Celtics in 1997. In 1999 he was a part of a three-way deal that sent him home, to the Denver Nuggets. The homecoming didn’t last long though. Denver traded him away a year later. However, in 2008 he made one final return to Colorado where Billups wore #7 for the Nuggets to honor John Elway. In 2009, he was the sole Nuggets player selected for the All-Star Game and that season he averaged 17.7 PPG.\n\nThe point guard played for seven teams while in the NBA but over that stretch (1997-2014) became a NBA champion, NBA Finals MVP and 5X All-Star just to name a few of his accomplishments.\n\nHe started his coaching career as an assistant with the Clippers in 2020 and in 2021 took over as the head coach of the Trail Blazers.\n\nCharania says the announcement will be officially made this weekend at the Final Four games."
