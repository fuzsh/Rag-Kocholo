        "text": "Carlos Osorio/Associated Press\n\nChauncey Billups turned down an opportunity to run the Cleveland Cavaliers a year ago.\n\nThat doesn't mean his post-playing plans have changed.\n\n\"My desire is to one day run a team, be in a front office and try to build a champion,\" Billups told Noah Trister of the Associated Press. \"I know that I will, and I know I'm going to do a good job. When that opportunity presents itself, and it's a good opportunity, I'll be ready to go.\"\n\nBillups, 41, has no NBA front-office experience. He has worked as an NBA analyst for ESPN since his playing career ended in 2014.\n\nThe Cavaliers attempted to lure him out of broadcasting to take over their front office last summer. Jason Lloyd of The Athletic reported Cavs owner Dan Gilbert lavished Billups with a five-year contract offer to run the team, though the former All-Star point guard declined.\n\nBillups was considered a potential contender for the Detroit Pistons opening when Stan Van Gundy was fired as coach and president of basketball operations. The basketball ops job went to Ed Stefanski, who has overhauled the front office and hired former Toronto Raptors Dwane Casey.\n\n\"I thought Stan did a good job. Stan is a very good coach, but sometimes you just need a new voice,\" Billups said. \"Coach Casey obviously has been a very good coach the last few years. He's really ascended to the top of the ranks in the league. Whatever happened in Toronto presented an opportunity for him to come here.\""
