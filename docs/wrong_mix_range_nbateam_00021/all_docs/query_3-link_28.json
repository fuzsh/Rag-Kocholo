        "text": "Over the years, there have been many words used to describe Chauncey Billups — Cool, Smooth, Most Popular Guy in the Room, Mr. Big Shot — but most people don’t remember this one:\n\nBust.\n\nThat’s what they were calling him after his first three years in the league. Drafted by Boston with the No 3 pick, he was traded midway through his rookie year. By the summer of 2000, he’d already played for four teams, and had been injured more than a Toy Story doll. The Celtics, Raptors, Nuggets and Magic all had something in common when it came to Billups: they’d all given up on him.\n\n“The truth of the matter is, at the time, I was a bust,” he says now. “As a third pick in the draft, you’re supposed to light the world on fire. And I didn’t.\n\n“I was underachieving in a major way.”\n\nThis is a story about how life comes at you in phases, and why you need to be on your toes for all of them. Chauncey Billups, now 47 and coaching the Portland Trailblazers, just found out he is going into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Hall of Fame? Had you told Billups in the summer of 2000 this was the mountaintop that awaited him, he’d have rolled his eyes, shook his head, and said, “Man, I’m just looking for a team.”\n\nMr. Big Shot almost didn't happen\n\nThat’s where Detroit came in. It may be hard to remember, given the Pistons current woes, that basketball once got people excited in this town. Joe Dumars had taken over as GM in 2000 and was slowly building a new roster with a new coach, Rick Carlisle. In the summer of 2002, Dumars had dinner at a local restaurant with Billups, who was then a free agent from Minnesota, his fifth team.\n\nBillups had wanted to sign back with the T-Wolves, but changed his mind after a meeting with GM Kevin McHale. Minnesota had a point guard named Terrell Brandon, who’d been injured during Billups’ time there.\n\n“Kevin told me, ‘Chauncey, we really want you. The thing is, if Terrell actually gets back healthy, he's going to be the starter.’ And I said, ‘Well, Big Mac, I appreciate that. I appreciate you being honest with me, but I'm really ready now.’\n\n“So that was it. I talked to Kevin Garnett and said, ‘I'm gone, bro.’ Had Terrell not been there, or not gotten back healthy, there's a great chance I never would have come to Detroit.”\n\nInstead, he met with Dumars that night, who said he saw unrealized talent in Billups. He told Chauncey — who, at that point, had a career average of 11 points per game — that he could be an NBA All-Star.\n\n“That meant a lot to me, because naturally, from what I’d been through, certainly nobody had told me that, you know? I was used to hearing everything I couldn't do, not what I could or what I was gonna do.”\n\nDumars proved prophetic. Pairing Billups with Ben Wallace, Chucky Atkins, newly-acquired Rip Hamilton and rookie Tayshaun Prince, the Pistons began to gel. They went all the way to the Eastern Conference finals that year, with Billups, the point guard, having his best season to date. He had always been a vocal guy, and quickly noticed that Wallace, the heart of the team, was uncommonly quiet. The voice of the locker room “was there for the taking” Billups says.\n\nHe took it.\n\nBy the end of that season, Chauncey was firmly entrenched as the team’s leader. That was also the year he earned the nickname “Mr. Big Shot.” Ironically, it only came after Billups had to beg his coach to let him play in the closing minutes.\n\n“I was starting, but Chucky (Atkins) was coming off the bench finishing games. So I went in and talked to Rick. I said, “I'm confused. I'm the only starting point guard in the league that doesn’t play the last six minutes of a game. What's going on?’ He’s like, ‘Chauncey, you're right. But I'm just so comfortable with Chucky. Last year, he made a lot of big shots for me.’\n\n“I said, ‘OK, that's cool. But last year I made some pretty big shots, too — like, you haven't even given me a chance to do it.’ And he was like, ‘You know what? You're right. That's fair.’\n\n“And literally, over the next two weeks, a bunch of games came down to the last seconds. I think I made three or four game-winners. And that's where the nickname came.”\n\nBut that was just the start.\n\nA team of outcasts becomes champions\n\nThe following season, with a new and challenging coach named Larry Brown, the Pistons had the fits and starts of a sportscar trying to rev on a cold morning. They knew they were good, maybe great, but their record was just OK.\n\n“Man, we were all over the place,” Billups recalls. “But we started playing better. And then, I don't know how Joe pulled it off, but we go get Rasheed Wallace at the trade deadline. And I can remember having one practice with him, and I said, ‘We're gonna win a championship.’”\n\nWallace was the missing piece, the long-range shooting, the court smarts, the toughness, the attitude. With Detroit as his fourth team, Rasheed fit right in with a Pistons group that made “O” for Outcast the letter on their sweater. Of the five starters, only Prince hadn’t been given up on by some other franchise.\n\nIT'S BEEN 20 YEARS? Pistons 2004 NBA championship team still one big family: 'It will never die'\n\n“I think that was like our connective tissue,” Billups says. “We all knew what the other had been through. So we shared that, but we also knew that we needed each other to win. None of us were good enough to just carry the team, like ‘Y'all just jump on my back.’ We knew that. We didn't even have to talk about it. It just played out that way.”\n\nThat Pistons team posted its best record in seven years and clawed through the playoffs, needing all five games to win the first round against Milwaukee, going seven games against the defending Eastern Conference champion Nets, then six tough games against their former coach, Carlisle, and his new team, the Indiana Pacers.\n\nBy the time they reached the Finals, few people gave the Pistons any chance to beat the L.A. Lakers, who featured huge stars like Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Gary Payton and Karl Malone.\n\nInstead, the Pistons clamped on the Lakers like the top of a peanut butter jar. Their defense was smothering. In winning four out of five games, Detroit never let L.A. score more than 87 points (in Game 3 they held the Lakers to 68) and they celebrated at the Palace of Auburn Hills with a stunning championship. Billups won the Finals MVP award by averaging 21 points a game, something he never did any season in his career, while making all the heady, steady plays.\n\n“The thing I felt most was just validation,” Billups says of that title. “My dream was always just to win a championship, you know? To lead a team to a championship. And, you know, the road that I went through to get there, well, obviously, there weren’t a lot of cars on that road, man.”\n\nA lonely highway.\n\nHe rode it to the stars.\n\nThe one that got away\n\nBillups would play six full seasons with the Pistons, reaching at least the Eastern Conference finals in every one of them. If the 2004 championship series was his biggest highlight, the 2005 version was his biggest regret.\n\n“We should have won another championship,” he says flatly. “We should have two.”\n\nThat season ended with a crushing Game 7 loss in the Finals to the San Antonio Spurs. Much of the blame was cast on Brown, who had reportedly been dallying with the Cleveland Cavaliers for a new job while the playoffs were going on. Fans and media felt he’d become a distraction.\n\nBillups disagrees.\n\n“I'm certainly not blaming that on LB,” he says. “What I blamed it on is if we could have found a way to get that (Eastern Conference finals) series over against Miami one game earlier. Not having to play a seven-game series in a conference finals and then go to San Antonio and play 48 hours later in Game 1. I feel like we could have won those games in San Antonio and won the series. But we had no legs for both — and got blown out twice. So I blame it on that. We just we couldn't get away from Miami, they were so good. They took the wind out of our sails.”\n\nThere was one play in that series that has haunted Billups for years. Game 5, the series tied, Pistons leading by two points with 9.4 seconds left in overtime. Coming back from a timeout, Brown inexplicably called for Lindsey Hunter to sub for Billups. Chauncey, who thought Hunter would sub for Rasheed Wallace, was stunned. It happened so fast, that all Billups could do was take a seat and watch as the Spurs worked the ball to Robert Horry, who was left all alone by Wallace. Horry hit a 3-pointer to ice the game and, many feel, decide the series.\n\nYears later, Billups would tell a podcast that he felt Brown had “choked” in that moment. Maybe. But one lesson was clear. Things were generally better for Detroit when Billups was on the floor.\n\n'Absolutely crushed'\n\nWhich brings us to his departure from the Motor City. It remains, to this day, a sore spot for fans and for Billups himself. Hoping to retire as a Piston, Chauncey had signed a long-term deal in 2007. But just two games into the 2008 season, the team was in Charlotte, getting ready for a shootaround, when Billups, dressing in his hotel room, got a call from his agent.\n\n“He said, ‘What the (expletive) is going on? Turn on 'SportsCenter.’ I turn on 'SportsCenter' and it said, ‘Chauncey Billups is going to the Denver Nuggets for Allen Iverson.’ That’s how I found out.\n\n“That was rough on me. That sucked. Once the other guys heard about it, everybody started calling me. The bus was supposed to be going over to shootaround but nobody got on. They canceled shootaround and everyone just kind of came to my room and we just lost it … lot of guys crying. And it was it was crazy, man, because you know, I had to go. Once they trade you, you have to get to the airport, fly to Detroit, pack some clothes, fly to Denver. …\n\n“I was crushed. Absolutely crushed.”\n\nIt ranks as one of Dumars most misguided moves, and pulled the support brick out of a franchise that was still winning a lot of games. It’s not an accident that the last playoff win with Billups in the lineup is still the Pistons’ last playoff victory — now almost 16 years ago.\n\nWas Billups angry with Dumars?\n\n“Yeah, I was very upset. I was hurt. Because Joe and I had a really close relationship, you know? And I just thought it could have been handled totally different.”\n\nDid you speak to him at that point?\n\n“That took a while. Obviously, he had to end up calling me. And that didn't go great. It took some years for us to really have a conversation. And obviously I came to Detroit to end my career in 2014 and he was still the GM of the team. So we kind of made peace with everything. But it took years, man.”\n\nBillups would officially retire as a Piston, after Dumars brought him back. “But by that point, I wasn't coming back to play. I wasn't good anymore. I was done. I was old. But he did know that it was important to me. I wanted to retire as a Piston. I appreciate him for that allowing me to do that.\n\n“We’re cool now.”\n\nNot as crazy as you may think\n\nOver the course of his career, Billups would officially join eight different franchises, a couple of them twice. It is one reason he was always the most popular guy on the floor, with opposing players hugging him and making plans to get together. “I was on so many teams, I played with most of those guys at some point or another.”\n\nIt’s also perhaps that reason that, despite a career stat line that does not dazzle — 15.2 points. 5.4 assists 2.9 rebounds — he was voted into the Hall of Fame, because so many people, players and media, got to witness the difference he made on the floor. The playmaking, the decision making, the clutch shooting, the defense, the overall control that made his cohorts better.\n\nWhen I asked Billups to finish the sentence he would like on a plaque if it began with the words: “Chauncey Billups was…” this is how he answers:\n\n“The ultimate teammate.”\n\nNot a bad moniker to take into the Hall. Detroit will always love Billups, who carried himself regally, never stooped to silliness, always had a kind word, and put the “C” in chill. But for all the good work he did on the court, fans should note what he did with his mind and his attitude, never letting the word “bust” define him as a player. Today is a long way from those hours when he wondered if any team wanted him.\n\n“You know, what's crazy?” he says now. “They're gonna announce the class (Saturday) and then I fly straight to Boston. We play the Celtics (today). I think about the irony of that, that they’re announcing me as a Hall of Famer and then I'm going back to Boston where they gave me 50 games before they traded me. That's kind of crazy, right?”\n\nKind of, yes. But that’s the thing about life. Sometimes your opportunities come from the biggest mountains and sometimes from the biggest holes. Chauncey Billups, to paraphrase Joni Mitchell, has seen life from both sides now. It looks better from the top, especially when you know how hard you have to climb to get there."
