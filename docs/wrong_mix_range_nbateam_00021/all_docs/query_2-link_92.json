        "text": "Long-time NBA reporter Chris Mannix said on Wednesday night that teams are “monitoring” Chauncey Billups after the Portland Trail Blazers recently fired two of his assistants.\n\n“Teams are monitoring Chauncey Billups’ situation in Portland, league sources told @SINow. The Blazers are rebuilding and just parted ways with two assistants, including Billups’s brother, Rodney. If Billups/Portland split, Billups would quickly emerge as a candidate for other jobs,” tweeted Mannix on his X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nAccording to Aaron Fentress of The Oregonian, the Portland Trail Blazers decided not to renew the contracts of top assistant Scott Brooks and defensive coach Rodney Billups, Chauncey’s younger brother.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers are coming off a forgettable 2023-24 campaign, as they finished the regular season with a 21-61 record, good for worst in the Western Conference. Since Chauncey Billups was appointed head coach, the team has amassed an 81-165 record in the last three seasons.\n\nChauncey Billups to coach at least one more year for the Portland Trail Blazers, per GM\n\nPortland Trail Blazers general manager Joe Cronin said in his exit interviews that they are “committed” to Chauncey Billups going into next season, calling him an “incredible leader” in the organization.\n\nBillups was signed to a five-year contract in 2021, which included a team option for the final season, so the upcoming 2024-25 season is the last guaranteed year for the Hall of Fame-bound guard if the front office doesn’t pick up his option.\n\nIf Chauncey Billups ultimately departs Portland, he would certainly be tied to coaching vacancies in Charlotte, Washington, and Los Angeles."
