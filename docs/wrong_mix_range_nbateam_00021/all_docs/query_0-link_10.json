        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers are looking to fill in some assistant roles on Chauncey Billups’ staff after the team announced it wouldn’t renew Scott Brooks nor Rodney Billups’ contracts.\n\nThe Blazers could be looking at a former head coach to make those changes, according to Rose Garden Report’s Sean Highkin.\n\nFormer Pacers head coach and Raptors assistant Nate Bjorkgren has been in attendance at the Blazers’ last few predraft workouts. Worth noting considering they currently have three open assistant spots to fill on Chauncey Billups’ staff.\n\nBjorkgren, who turns 49 later this month, started out as a G League assistant in 2007 and made his way to the NBA with the Phoenix Suns in 2015.\n\nHe was with the Toronto Raptors from 2018-20 and won a championship on Nick Nurse’s staff before becoming the head coach of the Indiana Pacers in 2020.\n\nBjorkgren only spent one season as the head coach of the Pacers before he was fired, citing tension between him and the team. He returned to Toronto to be an assistant for the Raptors under Nurse before he was fired and joined the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nNow, Bjorkgren could seek a return to the bench with the Blazers next season."
