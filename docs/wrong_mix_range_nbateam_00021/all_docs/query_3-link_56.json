        "text": "By DAVID BRANDT\n\nAP Sports Writer\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Vince Carter wowed the basketball world with his high-flying dunks for more than two decades. Chauncey Billups was a clutch guard and Finals MVP for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nTwo icons from the 2000s era of basketball are headed to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 13-member class inducted Saturday includes former Lakers, Grizzlies and Warriors executive Jerry West, who was already inducted as a player and as a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team. Also in the class: players Seimone Augustus, Michael Cooper, Walter Davis, Dick Barnett and Michele Timms, coaches Charles Smith, Harley Redin and Bo Ryan, broadcaster/coach Doug Collins and owner Herb Simon.\n\nThe 2024 class will be enshrined into the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, in August.\n\nBillups, 47, was a five-time All-Star and won an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He was also the MVP of the Finals that season and is now the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n“We don’t win a third NBA Championship without Chauncey’s leadership. When the ball was in his hands, you just knew he was going to make the right play,” former Pistons player and president of basketball operations — and soon-to-be fellow Hall of Famer — Joe Dumars said in a news release from the team. “His skillset and accomplishments on the court, his competitiveness and his sportsmanship validate this well-deserved honor.”\n\nBillups was the third overall pick in the 1997 draft by the Boston Celtics, but his pro career was a little slow to develop. He eventually found a home in Detroit, making his first All-Star team in his ninth season.\n\n“Seeing Chauncey elected to the Hall of Fame is so neat for me because his talent and leadership qualities are being rewarded at the highest level. Chauncey impacted the game every single time he stepped on the basketball court and truly refined his skills throughout the course of his career. He was an unselfish facilitator, tremendous scorer, willing defender and delivered in clutch moments. It was a joy to coach him, and he taught me as much as I hope I was able to teach him,” said former Pistons coach Larry Brown, another Hall of Famer. “His basketball story is a great example for all players in the way he overcame adversity early in his NBA career and ascended to an NBA All-Star, NBA Finals MVP and now a Hall of Famer.”\n\nPart of a balanced Pistons team that included Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince and Ben Wallace, Billups averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists per game in the 2004 Finals. They beat the Lakers in five games for the title.\n\n“Chauncey is the ultimate leader and connector – not only in the way he played, but how he’s continued contributing to the game as a broadcaster and now as a head coach. He made his mark in Detroit, and it’s hard to overstate what he means to our franchise and our community. His selflessness, poise and ability to step up in big moments helped define Pistons basketball for a generation. Chauncey is the latest in a long line of Pistons greats to enter the Hall of Fame,” Pistons owner Tom Gores said in the team’s news release. “His legacy, including this well-deserved recognition, serve as inspiration for our younger players and a shining example of the rich tradition celebrated by our franchise.”\n\nCarter, 47, was an eight-time All-Star and the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1999 with the Toronto Raptors. He had the longest career in NBA history, playing 22 seasons for the Raptors, Nets, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Hawks, Magic, Kings and Suns, and finished with 25,728 career points, good for 21st in league history.\n\nHe played in college at North Carolina under coach Dean Smith.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 guard’s longevity in the game was legendary and he was a useful player deep into his 40s, hanging with players less than half his age. He averaged five points over 60 games at age 43 with the Hawks in his final season.\n\nThe 85-year-old West was inducted as a contributor. The 14-time All-Star was inducted as a player in 1980. He spent more than 20 years as an executive for the Los Angeles Lakers — helping the franchise win eight championships over a span from 1980 to 2002 — and was also the general manager for the Memphis Grizzlies and an executive with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAugustus, 39, was a four-time WNBA champion with the Minnesota Lynx. The 6-foot-0 guard played in college at LSU, helping the program to three Final Fours. She’s 13th in WNBA history with 6,005 career points."
