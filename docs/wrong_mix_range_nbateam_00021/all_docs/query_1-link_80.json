        "text": "Many times the perception of a head coach depends on who accompanies him on the staff. Or what is the same, that the assistants matter much more than what is apparent in whether a coach belongs to the elite or the heap. Chauncey Billups, although the Portland Trail Blazers indicate otherwise, has not shown great things in the two years that he has been leading the bench. Beyond the relationship with the players. Now, facing a third campaign that should represent the first stone of the new project, the Blazers have added Nate Bjorkgren and Chris Fleming to Billups' work team.\n\nNate Bjorkgren was head coach of the Indiana Pacers in the 2020-21 season. Which ended with the players turning their backs on him for trying to change the style of play that the team practiced with Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon at the helm. Since then, he has only had one experience with the Toronto Raptors during the 22-23 campaign.\n\nAs for Chris Fleming, his resume is thinner. In recent years he has had an important position as assistant to Billy Donovan in the Chicago Bulls. Experience that adds to his previous stops at the Brooklyn Nets and Denver Nuggets.\n\n(Cover photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)"
