        "text": "By Stefan Djordjevic / info@eurohoops.net\n\nChauncey Billups and Larry Drew are finalizing assistant coaching deals to join Ty Lue’s staff with the LA Clippers, according to Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nLue was named Clippers head coach in October after being an assistant under Doc Rivers last season. Before that, he led the Cavaliers to a 128-83 record and the 2015-16 NBA title.\n\nBillups was a finalist to take over as head coach of the Indiana Pacers before they decided on Nate Bjorkgren. The 2004 Finals MVP was a three-time All-NBA and a five-time All-Star in his 17 years long playing career.\n\nDrew had a short stint with the Cavs (19-57) while he also coached the Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks, logging a 162-226 overall record. He was also an assistant during all four years of LeBron James’ second run in Cleveland that resulted in four straight Finals appearances, including the title."
