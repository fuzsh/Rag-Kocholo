        "text": "Chauncey Billups' net worth in 2024 is $35 million. Billups is a basketball coach who currently serves as the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nBefore his coaching days, Billups was also a former NBA player. As a player, he is a five-time All-Star, a three-time All-NBA player, an NBA champion, and a Finals MVP. For this piece, let's take a closer look at Chauncey Billups' net worth in 2024.\n\nWhat is Chauncey Billups' net worth in 2024?: $35 million (estimate)\n\nChauncey Billups' net worth in 2024 is $35 million. This is according to reputable outlets such as Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nChauncey Billups was born on Sept. 25, 1976, in Denver. He attended George Washington High School, where Billups kick-started his amateur basketball career. Here, he was honored as Mr. Colorado Basketball thrice and was a McDonald's All-American.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Billups decided to commit to the University of Colorado. In two seasons, Billups averaged 18.5 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, while shooting 38 percent from the 3-point line. For his efforts, Billups was part of the First team All-Big 12 and was a consensus second team All-American. Furthermore, he also helped the Buffaloes earn their first NCAA Tournament appearance in nearly three decades.\n\nChauncey Billups is drafted by the Celtics\n\nAfter two years of college basketball, Billups opted to declare for the 1997 NBA Draft. On draft night, Billups was selected in the first round with the third overall pick by the Boston Celtics. Shortly after, as per Spotrac, the 6-foot-3 guard signed with the Celtics on a three-year rookie deal worth $8.22 million.\n\nIn his first 51 games with the Celtics, Billups put up decent numbers of 11.1 points, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 rebounds per outing. But despite decent numbers, Billups had a difficult time in getting along with Celtics head coach Rick Pitino.\n\nIn the middle of his rookie season, the Celtics traded Billups to the Toronto Raptors along with Dee Brown, Roy Rogers and John Thomas in exchange for Kenny Anderson, Popeye Jones and Zan Tabak. For the rest of the season, Billups averaged 11.3 points, 3.3 assists, and 2.7 rebounds per game.\n\nChauncey Billups is traded to the Nuggets\n\nBefore the start of the 1998-99 season, Billups found himself on the move once again. The first-round draft pick was part of a three-team trade involving the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets and the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nLanding in his hometown of Denver, Billups quickly made his presence felt. In his first full season, Billups averaged 13.9 points, 3.8 assists, and 2.1 rebounds per game.\n\nBillups played for the Nuggets until midway through the 1999-2000 season. Around this time, Billups was sent to the Orlando Magic. But due to an injured shoulder, the 6-3 guard never suited up for the Magic and missed the rest of the season.\n\nChauncey Billups signs with the Timberwolves\n\nAfter a disappointing season, Billups decided to sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves on a two-year contract worth $4.73 million. Initially serving as a backup guard in the Timberwolves' rotation, Billups had a breakout 2001-02 season.\n\nIn his second season in Minnesota, Billups registered 12.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per outing, while shooting 39 percent from deep. For his efforts, the Timberwolves made it to the 2002 playoffs after posting a 50-32 record.\n\nHowever, the Wolves failed get past the Dallas Mavericks in the first round after being swept. Billups emerged as a silver lining for Minnesota by putting up 22.0 points, 4.3 assists, and 4.0 rebounds per game in the series.\n\nChauncey Billups signs with the Pistons\n\nFresh off a stellar season with Minnesota, Billups emerged as a free-agent target for the Detroit Pistons, who were looking for someone to fill the point-guard position. The first-round pick signed a lucrative six-year deal worth $34 million to join the Pistons. Joining Detroit would be the decision that powered Billups into an NBA star.\n\nIn 2004, Billups played an instrumental role in leading the Pistons to their first NBA championship. In the postseason, Billups averaged 16.4 points, 5.9 assists and 3.0 rebounds per game. Furthermore, with Billups as the main facilitator, the Pistons outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers, and the heavily favored Los Angeles Lakers. For his efforts, Billups was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nAfter winning his first and only NBA championship, Billups earned his first All-Star Game appearance in the 2005-06 season. Furthermore, he also earned his first All-NBA team selection later that year. Billups finished the season with averages of 18.5 points, 8.6 assists, and 3.1 rebounds per game while shooting 43 percent from deep.\n\nIn addition to this, the Pistons would emerge as a consistent championship contender, making the NBA Finals in 2005 and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2006 and 2007. Unfortunately, none would result in another championship for the Pistons.\n\nIn 2007, after a second-straight All-Star season, Billups inked a five-year year deal worth $60 million to rejoin the Pistons. The 2007-08 season saw Billups average 17.0 points, 6.8 assists, and 2.7 rebounds per game. However, it would also be the final season for Billups' first stint in Detroit.\n\nChauncey Billups returns to the Nuggets\n\nStill recovering from a hamstring injury that Billups suffered in the 2008 playoffs, the Pistons decided to ship Billups back to his home city of Denver in a blockbuster trade that also featured Allen Iverson. With the Nuggets, Billups continued to display All-Star form. In the 2009-2010 season, Billups averaged a career-best 19.5 points to go along with 5.6 assists and 3.1 rebounds per game.\n\nDespite Billups' desire to hang up his sneakers in Denver, the Nuggets made the decision to trade away the NBA champion to the New York Knicks as part of the blockbuster three-team trade that featured All-Star Carmelo Anthony in the middle of the 2010-11 season. In 21 games as a Knick, Billups averaged 17.5 points and 5.5 assists per game.\n\nAfter a brief stint in New York, Billups was waived via amnesty. The move paved the way for the Los Angeles Clippers to pick the five-time All-Star off waivers.\n\nAs part of the Lob City era, Billups registered 15.0 points and 4.0 assists per game in his first season as a Clipper. Before the 2012-2013 season, Billups signed a one year contract extension, worth $4.2 million to rejoin the team.\n\nFor Billups' curtain season, the NBA champion decided to join the Detroit Pistons by signing a two-year deal worth $5 million. He averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 assists per game to conclude his lengthy NBA career.\n\nChauncey Billups becomes assistant coach with the Clippers\n\nSix years since hanging up his basketball sneakers, Billups returned to the Clippers organization after he was brought in as an assistant coach by Tyronn Lue.
