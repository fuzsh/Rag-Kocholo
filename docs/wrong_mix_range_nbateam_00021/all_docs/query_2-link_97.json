Their inclusion underscores the diverse contributions that have shaped and enriched the sport, making this recognition truly exceptional.”\n\nBillups received the nickname “Mr. Big Shot” because he delivered every time when the rubber needed to meet the road, no matter how crucial the plays were.\n\nWhile spending 17 seasons in the association, Billups, who was drafted in 1997 by the Boston Celtics, made his name with the Pistons during the mid-2000s, where he helped the Detroit Bad Boys 2.0 achieve the ultimate prize by five-game sweeping the vaunted Los Angeles Lakers during the 2004 NBA Finals.\n\nBillups was a five-time NBA All-Star and the 2004 Finals MVP after leading the Detroit Pistons to their third NBA championship in franchise history.\n\nFor his accolades with the Pistons, Mr. Big Shot had his No. 1 jersey retired in 2016. During his 17-year career, Billups’ averaged 15.2 points and 5.4 assists per game, while his 89.4 free throw percentage is sixth best in NBA/ABA history.\n\nYou can catch Billups roaming the sidelines for the Portland Trail Blazers, where he has been the head coach since 2021."
