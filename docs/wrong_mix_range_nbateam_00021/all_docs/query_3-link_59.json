        "text": "Some very light rumors spread around the internet Wednesday afternoon about the Portland Trail Blazers’ coaching situation. SI’s Chris Mannix provided an unexpected update on Head Coach Chauncey Billups. Days after the Blazers did not renew the contracts of his assistant coaches, Billups’ status was reportedly being watched by other teams. As quoted from Mannix’s social media account:\n\nChris Mannix (@SIChrisMannix)\n\nTeams are monitoring Chauncey Billups situation in Portland, league sources told @SInow. The Blazers are rebuilding and just parted ways with two assistants, including Billups’s brother, Rodney. If Billups/Portland split, Billups would quickly emerge as a candidate for other jobs\n\nShortly afterward, Blazers reporter Sean Highkin confirmed on social media that he’d heard similar murmurs.\n\nBillups was signed to a five-year contract in 2021, which included a team option for the last season. The upcoming 2024-25 season will be the last guaranteed season for Billups unless the Blazers pick up his team option. So far, there has been no report or announcement of them doing so.\n\nIn his three years as the head coach of the Trail Blazers, Billups has a win/loss record of 81-165. Portland is his first NBA coaching position."
