        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — The Trail Blazers didn’t look particularly sharp on Tuesday, and compared to the rest of their swashbuckling tour through the first month of the season, their 117-110 win over San Antonio wasn’t their most spirited effort either.\n\nBut as it has often happened during the Blazers’ unexpected ascension to the top of the Western Conference, Tuesday’s win was punctuated by some heady and bold moves from coach Chauncey Billups.\n\nAs he has done on two other occasions this season, Billups on Tuesday made a quick and decisive call to sideline center Jusuf Nurkić and pivot to the smaller and more active Drew Eubanks. And stuck in a tense back-and-forth midway through the fourth quarter, Billups went to what is becoming his specialty — throwing a defensive curveball at an opponent — implementing a zone defense that held San Antonio to four points over the final four minutes.\n\nThe Blazers’ 10-4 start has been propelled by some remarkable physical feats. Jerami Grant (29 points against the Spurs) is playing like an All-Star. Damian Lillard (22 points, 11 assists on Tuesday) has returned from abdominal surgery better than ever. Anfernee Simons (five 3-pointers) has shot the Blazers to victories. And rookie Shaedon Sharpe (13 points) is looking like the steal of the 2022 NBA Draft.\n\nBut it’s the mind of Billups that has added purpose and focus to those skills.\n\n“I think it’s been great,” Lillard said when asked him about Billups’ game management this season. “In this league, if you give somebody too much of the same look they are going to pick you apart. I think that has been something that has been in our favor. We’ve gone small, we’ve played zone, we’ve picked up full court, we’ve been in full-court zone, we’ve trapped … we’ve mixed it up so much that it’s been unpredictable.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nJerami Grant has been a game-changer for the Trail Blazers, just as Damian Lillard envisioned\n\nTuesday was also another example of Billups holding a pointed and effective halftime talk. Billups says he is not big on giving rah-rah speeches, but he is adamant about immediately addressing first-half issues. On Tuesday, with the Blazers’ starters playing flat, and the team as a whole playing sloppily, players say Billups was sharp with his tongue and clear with his message.\n\nSimons said Billups aired some video clips from the first half that highlighted ways the Blazers’ weren’t connected. And then he pointed out plays when they weren’t physical enough.\n\n“He was like, ‘This game will go one of two ways …'” Simons said. “And he finished by saying ‘We have to go back to being us.'”\n\nSaid Lillard: “I like that he just gets straight to the point. It never feels like the end of the world, but it never feels like, ‘All right, we didn’t do great, but that’s OK.’ He gets on us, and shows us examples of what he is talking about, and we move on to the next thing.”\n\nBillups says there have been other pointed halftime speeches this season — one last week at Miami came to his mind — but he says his halftime talks aren’t designed to motivate as much as educate. And a wonderful tool in teaching, he finds, is to hold players accountable, or as he likes to say “put an address on it.”\n\n“I’m not a big speech guy, but I’m going to tell you what’s going on,’’ Billups said. “There have been several times at halftime where you have to put an address on it. If there are two or three dudes who are not getting it done, I’m not the coach who says ‘we need to do better with closeouts’… No. I say (names) … I put an address on it. It goes a long ways with guys. I’m not a blanket dude — everybody sees it, so I’m not going to come in and put a blanket on it. I’m going to say this is you, you, and you.”\n\nIf there are two pillars that prop up Billups’ early coaching career, it’s his ability to relate to players and the similarity in how he coaches the superstar down to the two-way players. It’s what he took from Larry Brown, who coached him to a title in Detroit. Coincidentally, Brown was close with Tuesday’s coaching opponent, Gregg Popovich.\n\n“They coach everybody the same way,” Billups said. “No matter if it’s your best player or a player on a two-way. They hired me to coach, and that means everybody. I know most people don’t have the courage to do that, but I do, and it’s because I always appreciated a coach being honest with me. That got the best out of me. I won a championship that way.’”\n\nSo far, in his one-plus season in Portland, Billups has been mostly well received. There were a few grumbles from players last season about his bluntness, and from Billups there were a few grumbles about players’ toughness and savvy. But those players have either departed or been traded. The new roster is not only accepting his coaching, they are demanding his toughness.\n\n“He’s on me 24/7 … 24/7,” Simons said. “And I told him, that’s all I want. I won’t get offended by criticism.”\n\nSaid Billups: “There’s a lot of times when I’m sure they don’t love it. I didn’t love it. I lost a lot of sleep with coach Brown. But what they do know is that I care, and it’s all about us, the team, and us getting better. They know when they are their best self, they are going to get paid. So at the end of the day, it’s good for everybody. It’s not disrespectful in any way, it’s passionate. And I think they know that, so that’s why I think they know, ‘I got to take that … it’s coming from the right spot.'”\n\nThat’s why decisions like he made on Monday — playing 6-foot-9 Eubanks a season-high 33 minutes while playing starter Nurkić only 15 — have been so well received by the locker room. Nurkić has been one of Billups’ biggest supporters, and he has turned into the team’s biggest cheerleader when Billups has veered away from him to counter different lineups. On Tuesday, Eubanks had nine points and seven rebounds and put the Blazers ahead for good with an and-one basket with 3:57 left.\n\n“It’s one of those feel things,” Billups said. “Nurk got off to such a tough start … and it never is anything personal. But I’m going to do what is best for the team in the moment. And Drew on both ends of the floor gave us some great, great moments. His speed into screens puts teams at a disadvantage … everything he did was awesome tonight, and has been all year, actually.”\n\nIt was difficult to say exactly what kind of coach Billups was after his rookie campaign last season. Lillard had season-ending surgery in January. Three starters were traded in February. The team president resigned in November and the general manager was fired in December. Using mostly youngsters and G League players, the Blazers lost 21 of their final 23 games.\n\nBut Simons said he could see in those final months that Billups had something special. He thought like a player, saw the game from the sideline like a player. Simons said he knew once Billups was given some talent and experience, the team would flourish. One of the reasons for his confidence in Billups was on display on Tuesday. Simons said he ran a play that was successful, and before the play was called for him again, Billups coached him to be prepared for a counter the Spurs might run to prevent the same play from working. The Spurs did just what Billups predicted.\n\n“He knew they would change it up, and told me it would happen before it happened,” Simons said. “It’s almost like he is still playing.”\n\nAnd like a player, Billups still reviews the game film to pick apart his night. Just as when he was a storied player for 17 years, playing with the strength of knowing he put his work in at the gym, Billups today generates coaching confidence from his film study.\n\n“I don’t have the most experience, so I have to make up for it somehow,” Billups said. “Work. Gotta put it in … studying situations, and knowing my guys, and other teams.”\n\nThat also means learning from mistakes. Last week, during a 117-112 loss at Dallas, Billups determined that he took too long to make an adjustment to double team Mavericks’ superstar Luka Dončić. He ordered a defense that would fake a double-team, but that backfired because it left Spencer Dinwiddie open for 3-pointers. He was hesitant to do a full double-team because the schedule hadn’t allowed the team to practice in 13 days, and they had yet to fine tune how they should rotate when doubling a player.\n\n“I beat myself up every night after games when I come home and watch it over again, wondering what I could have done better,” Billups said. “Could I have made an adjustment earlier? Could I have subbed a little earlier? Should I have taken my timeout … But I also and say, ‘I did it right there.'”\n\nAbout 36 hours after the Dallas loss, Billups was back in the laboratory, whistle in his mouth and his players before him on the practice court. Did he get to the double-team coverage with full rotation?\n\n“Of course,” Billups said, with a smile.\n\n(Photo of Chauncey Billups and Damian Lillard: Alika Jenner / Getty Images)"
