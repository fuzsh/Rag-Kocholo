        "text": "The Detroit Pistons played well enough to give Michael Curry a win in his debut as a head coach.\n\nTayshaun Prince scored 19 points as part of a balanced attack that gave the Curry-led Pistons a 100-94 win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night in the opener for both teams.\n\nDanny Granger led the new-look Pacers with 33 points and got some help from new teammates T.J. Ford, Jarrett Jack and Rasho Nesterovic.\n\nJust eight of the 15 players on the opening-night roster that were on the team at the end of last year.\n\nThe Pistons planned to shake up their core — which helped them win a championship in 2004 and advance to six straight Eastern Conference finals — but they ended up standing pat and hoping Curry along with some young players will take the team back to the NBA finals.\n\nDetroit’s Chauncey Billups had 13 points and seven assists, Richard Hamilton scored 15 and Rasheed Wallace added nine points and seven rebounds. Walter Hermann had 10 points, helping the Pistons’ bench outscore Indiana’s reserves 38-18.\n\nThe Pistons pulled away with a 20-6 run, spanning the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, to build an 80-64 lead.\n\nBut as they seemed to relax, letting their opponents get back in the game, as they did under former coaches Flip Saunders, Larry Brown and Rick Carlisle during the previous seven seasons.\n\nSaunders was fired in June and was replaced by Curry, one of his assistants who had only a year of coaching experience.\n\nIndiana went on a 13-2 run to pull within five points midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nBillups’ 3-pointer with 3 minutes left put the Pistons ahead 89-81, essentially sealing the win.\n\nGranger’s 3-pointer pulled the Pacers within four points with 24 seconds left, but they couldn’t get closer.\n\nTroy Murphy had 13 points and Marquis Daniels scored 12. In their debut with the Pacers, Ford scored 10 points, Jack had nine, Nesterovic scored eight and first-round pick Brandon Rush added seven.\n\nThe Pacers were without Mike Dunleavy, who is out with a tendinitis in his right knee. He went through some pregame warmups and might be ready to play in a couple of weeks.\n\nThey have revamped their roster in the wake of the 2004 brawl at The Palace with the Pistons and fans, wanting to improve its image in Indianapolis and perhaps challenge for a spot in the playoffs after missing them in consecutive years for the first time in two decades.\n\nAmir Johnson, a 21-year-old forward on his fourth NBA season, started his first NBA game and had six points, six rebounds and three blocks.\n\nHe joined four starters, who began a game together for the 294th time in the regular season.\n\nSince the 1991-92 season, only Indiana’s quartet of Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Dale Davis started more regular season games together. Those Pacers started together 320 times from the 1994-95 to the 1999-2000 season."
