        "meta_description": "<strong>INDIANAPOLIS </strong> The Detroit Pistons didnt feel like celebrating after knocking the Indiana Pacers out of the playoffs and sending Reggie Miller into retirement.It wouldnt have seemed right, especially after the 39-year-old sharpshooter made a teary-eyed retreat to the bench in the final seconds Thursday night.This is a sad day, really, Detroits Chauncey Billups said after Detroits 88-79 victory sent the Pistons back to the Eastern Conference finals and ensured that Millers career would end without a championship.Richard Hamilton scored 28 points and Billups added 23 as Detroit won the best-of-seven series 4-2. The Pistons will open the conference finals on Monday at Miami.It was the final game for Miller, the NBAs 12th-leading career scorer who is retiring after 18 years in the league. He broke out of a shooting slump and led Indiana with 27 points, and his final basket was a 3-pointer with under 2 minutes left to pull Indiana to 82-79.Hamilton then hit a basket and Billups added two free throws with 26 seconds left before Miller missed a 3-pointer and left the game to a prolonged, standing ovation which the Pistons joined in as the crowd chanted Reg-gie, Reg-gie with 16 seconds to go.At the end of the game, the chant changed to One more year.It was definitely very emotional, Hamilton said. I dont think Ive ever been in a game where a team thats about to move on and a guy comes out of the game and the other team is cheering.For a guy his age, the way he played tonight was unbelievable, Hamilton said.As Miller left the court, he embraced players from both teams.Millers 27 points were his most since he had 33 in Game 3 of the first-round series against Boston.Jermaine ONeal, still bothered by a sore shoulder that sidelined him late in the regular season, added 22 points and 11 rebounds for Indiana.The Pacers led almost the entire first half and turned back every Detroit rally until two straight baskets by Hamilton put the Pistons ahead early in the fourth quarter. The final score marked the Pistons biggest lead of the game.Detroit has won eight consecutive playoff series clinchers over the last three seasons.There were very sentimental emotions from all of us, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. Tonight, the reality is we were beaten by a team thats simply better. We played one of our better games tonight and they were able to win a very tough close-out game on the road.The Pacers, hoping to extend Millers career at least one more game, finally found their shooting touch after being blown out the past two games.Miller, one of the NBAs great clutch shooters who had been stymied into 38 percent shooting through the first five games of this series, shot 11-of-16 and made four 3-pointers. Reminiscent of past playoff glory, two of his 3-pointers came in a span of 39 seconds late in the second quarter after nine straight points by Billups and a free throw by Hamilton brought the Pistons within 40-37.Billups dribbled out of bounds for a turnover, and Miller hit one 3-pointer. Seconds later after Billups missed a 3-point attempt and with the Indiana crowd already chanting for Miller, he responded with another 3-pointer to put the Pacers up 46-37.Detroit got back into the game with two big runs in the third quarter.The first time, after a rebound basket by Ben Wallace cut Indianas lead to 48-47, ONeal, Dale Davis and Miller scored consecutive baskets, and a free throw by Miller on a technical foul against Rasheed Wallace made it 55-47.The Pacers still led 59-51 before a basket and free throw by Hamilton started an 11-2 run, and two more free throws by Hamilton gave the Pistons their first lead, 62-61. Indiana regained the lead at the end of the period on a dunk by Foster and opened the fourth quarter with a basket by ONeal and 3-pointer by Anthony Johnson.The Pistons then scored seven straight points to take the lead for good, denying the Pacers a chance to give Miller a shot at a championship. Indianas only trip to the NBA Finals was in 2000, when the Pacers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.Words can never express how I feel to the city and fans, Miller said. The city has really embraced me and understood we all had one common goal. Unfortunately, I never delivered on that, but it was an unbelievable ride.",
