        "text": "DETROIT - Detroit Pistons legend Chauncey Billups will not play when the BIG3 tips at Little Caesars Arena.\n\nHowever, he will be in attendance when Ice Cube's professional 3-on-3 league plays a four-game slate in downtown Detroit beginning at 6 p.m. on Friday, July 13.\n\n\"I'm not going to be able to play,\" Billups, whose No. 1 hangs in the rafters of the arena, told MLive on Thursday. \"I had surgery on my knee a few months back and I'm just trying to get it right and strong.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that I won't be able to play. I begged Cube and those guys to put Detroit on the list this season so it sucks that I won't be able to play, but I'll be there enjoying the festivities.\"\n\nBig3 Commissioner Clyde 'The Glide' Drexler previously said he was hopeful Billups would be able to play in Detroit, but it appears he's still a little way off. Billups said he wasn't sure when he will be able to get back on the court.\n\nBillups is the captain of the Killer 3s, a team that also includes former Indiana Pacers foes Metta World Peace and Stephen Jackson.\n\nThe Killer 3s will take on Trilogy, who are coached by original Detroit \"Bad Boy\" Rick Mahorn, in the first game of the night.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed that I won't be able to play in front of my home crowd,\" Billups said. \"Extremely disappointed. Everyone knows my affinity for Detroit and its fans.\"\n\n\"And I mean all the fans, not just basketball fans, but I'm just crazy about the city. Feel like they adopted me. I'm excited to be back. Any little reason I get to come back to the city, I'm there.\"\n\nBillups, who had his No. 1 retired by the Pistons in 2016, averaged 16.5 points and 6.2 assists during his eight seasons in Detroit.\n\nThe leader of a legendary starting five that included Ben Wallace, Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace, he orchestrated six-straight Eastern Conference Finals appearances for the Pistons from 2003 to 2008. He was named NBA Finals MVP in 2004."
