        "text": "Allen Iverson and Chauncey Billups had big games for their new teams in two of the most difficult places to win in the NBA.\n\nIverson, acquired from Denver for Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb, helped Detroit improve to 3-2 since the trade, scoring 25 points in the Pistons’ 106-95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.\n\n“We just played a good all-around game,” Iverson said. “It’s just about playing basketball, understanding what we want to do on the basketball court.\n\n“We didn’t feel like it would take long, but we knew it would be kind of shaky in the beginning because I’m a totally different player than Chauncey Billups. I’m a lot more aggressive when it comes to driving to the basket, so my teammates have to know what spot I want them to be in to be able to create shots for them.”\n\nBillups had 18 points and seven assists in Denver’s 94-85 victory over defending champion Boston. The Nuggets are 4-1 with Billups in the lineup.\n\n“It’s a huge win,” Billups said. “This kind of atmosphere is one of the best you can play in. These are the kind of games where you learn a lot about your teammates and how mentally tough and strong they are.”\n\nIn other NBA games Friday night, it was: New York 116, Oklahoma City 106; San Antonio 77, Houston 75; Philadelphia 94, Indiana 92; Phoenix 97, Sacramento 95 in overtime; Charlotte 104, Utah 96; Miami 97, Washington 77; New Jersey 115, Atlanta 108; Orlando 102, Dallas 100; New Orleans 87, Portland 82; and Milwaukee 101, Memphis 96 in overtime.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Rasheed Wallace had 25 points and 13 rebounds to help Detroit hand the Lakers their first loss in eight games this season.\n\nKobe Bryant scored 29 points for the Lakers, but went 12-of-30 from the floor.\n\nBoth Bryant and Iverson moved up on the NBA’s career scoring list. Bryant has 21,817 points and jumped into 21st ahead of Larry Bird (21,791) and Gary Payton (21,813). Iverson (23,156) passed Elgin Baylor (23,149) for 19th place.\n\nIn Boston, Carmelo Anthony had 18 points and 13 rebounds for Denver.\n\nRay Allen had 26 points for the Celtics (8-2), who lost their first home game this season and snapped a six-game winning streak.\n\n“There was a lot of fight,” Denver coach George Karl said. “I think any time you play the champions, you have to play with kind of a tiger-like intensity.”\n\nKnicks 116, Thunder 106\n\nAt New York, Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph each scored 29 points, combining for 10 in the final 4 minutes after New York had blown most of a 30-point lead.\n\nNate Robinson made his first five shots, giving him 13 in a row over two games, and Randolph had 19 rebounds in his seventh straight double-double. The Knicks (6-3) are off to their best start since also opening 6-3 in 1998-99.\n\nKevin Durant returned from a one-game absence because of an ankle injury to score 23 points for Oklahoma City. The Thunder have lost six straight to fall to 1-8.\n\nSpurs 77, Rockets 75\n\nAt San Antonio, Tim Duncan scored 22 points and blocked Aaron Brooks’ layup with a second left for San Antonio.\n\nRookie George Hill, playing in place of Tony Parker at point guard, added 17 points to help San Antonio _ down 14 points with 7:37 to go _ improve to 3-5.\n\nRon Artest led Houston with 18 points.\n\n76ers 94, Pacers 92\n\nAt Indianapolis, Thaddeus Young had 25 points and 10 rebounds and Philadelphia overcame a 26-point deficit.\n\nAndre Miller added 19 points, and Elton Brand had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the 76ers. Danny Granger had 18 points for Indiana.\n\nSuns 97, Kings 95, OT\n\nAt Sacramento, Calif., Shaquille O’Neal tied a season high with 29 points and had 13 rebounds and six assists for short-handed Phoenix.\n\nThe Suns played without Steve Nash, Matt Barnes and Leandro Barbosa. Nash and Barnes were suspended for a fight against Houston, and Barbosa left the team following his mother’s death in Brazil.\n\nBeno Udrih had 21 points for Sacramento.\n\nBobcats 104, Jazz 96\n\nAt Charlotte, N.C., Raymond Felton scored 23 points, and Gerald Wallace added 22 for Charlotte.\n\nCarlos Boozer had 26 points and 15 rebounds for Utah. The Jazz have lost three of their last four games after opening 5-0.\n\nHeat 97, Wizards 77\n\nAt Miami, Dwyane Wade scored 24 points and Miami held Washington without a field goal for 9 minutes in the second half.\n\nAntawn Jamison had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Washington. The Wizards are 0-4 on the road and an Eastern Conference-worst 1-6 overall.\n\nNets 115, Hawks 108\n\nAt East Rutherford, N.J., Devin Harris, back in the lineup after missing three games because of a sprained left ankle, scored 30 points for New Jersey.\n\nJoe Johnson scored 30 of his 32 points in the second half for Atlanta, which has lost two straight after opening 6-0.\n\nMagic 102, Mavericks 100\n\nAt Dallas, Rashard Lewis scored 23 points, including the tying and go-ahead points on free throws with 10.9 seconds left, in Orlando’s first win in Dallas since 1997.\n\nDirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 24 points. The Mavericks have lost five straight.\n\nHornets 87, Trail Blazers 82\n\nAt New Orleans, David West scored 18 points and James Posey hit two 3-pointers in the final minute for New Orleans’ only field goals in the last 8:30.\n\nPortland’s Greg Oden had 11 points in his second game back from a sprained foot.\n\nBucks 101, Grizzlies 96, OT\n\nAt Memphis, Tenn., Ramon Sessions had 20 points, including a pair of free throws that put Milwaukee ahead with 42.6 seconds left in overtime.\n\nRichard Jefferson led the Bucks with 26 points and 10 rebounds. O.J. Mayo had 25 points for Memphis."
