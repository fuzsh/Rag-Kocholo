Chauncey Billups accepted an assistant coach position with the L.A. Clippers on Thursday, but that doesn’t take him out of the running to be head coach of the Indiana Pacers.

A league source with direct knowledge of the situation told IndyStar that Billups, who has been a TV analyst for the Clippers, will join them on the bench "if he doesn’t get the Indy job." He's still a candidate to replace Nate McMillan, who was fired in August after a first-round playoff exit.

The Clippers fired Doc Rivers recently and promoted Ty Lue from his staff.

Billups, 44, has been courted by several teams for front-office roles in the past few years but he’s determined to be on the bench next season, which will likely begin in 2021. Rivers had offered him a role on his staff, IndyStar reported, and the Pacers previously have expressed interest in the NBA champion point guard for the Detroit Pistons.

Multiple league sources have told IndyStar that the Pacers’ broad coaching search is winding down. They’re expected to pick three finalists and have them meet with ownership before the end of the month.

Billups, who has no sideline experience but is a popular figure with players around the league, is a strong candidate to be finalist along with veteran coach Mike D’Antoni.
