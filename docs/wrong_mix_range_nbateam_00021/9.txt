Chauncey Billups, whom the Celtics selected with the No. 3 pick in the 1997 NBA draft before trading him during his rookie season, was among 14 finalists for the 2024 Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame induction class, which was announced Friday in Indianapolis. The final class will be announced in Phoenix on April 6 at the NCAA Menâ€™s Final Four.

After being selected as a second-team All-American out of Colorado, Billups played 51 games for the Celtics, averaging 11.1 points and 4.3 assists, but he clashed with coach Rick Pitino and was dealt as part of a seven-player deal that brought Kenny Anderson and Popeye Jones to Boston.

Billups went on to become a five-time All-Star and 2004 Finals MVP after leading the Detroit Pistons to their third NBA championship. Over a 17-year career he averaged 15.2 points and 5.4 assists while shooting 89.4 percent from the free-throw line, the sixth best mark in league history. He is currently the head coach of the Trail Blazers.
