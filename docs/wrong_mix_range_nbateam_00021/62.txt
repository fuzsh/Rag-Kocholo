The Indiana Pacers are working hard to fill the vacancy left by the firing of Nate McMillan in August.

A recent tweet by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said sources indicated the second round of interviews would take place this week and the following week.

The potential coaching candidates mentioned as receiving the chance at sit-down interviews include Chauncey Billups, New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach Chris Finch and former Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger.

Wojnarowski noted Joerger is believed to be "a strong contender in the process."

Here's a look at the potential coaches for the Pacers:

Chauncey Billups

Billups has never held a coaching position in the NBA and is currently an analyst for ESPN. Wojnarowski previously compared the potential hiring of Billups to that of Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas, who were high-profile players that had never coached in the NBA before landing their gigs.

Originally drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1997 with the third overall pick, the guard was traded after 51 games his rookie year and played for four different teams before emerging as a star for the Detroit Pistons in 2002-03.

Mr. Big Shot claimed NBA Finals MVP when the Piston defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 4-1, in 2004.

In 17 seasons, Billups averaged 15.2 points, 5.4 assists and 2.9 rebounds per game. He was a two-time NBA All-Defensive team member, made two Second Team All-NBA twice, named Third Team All-NBA once and was a five-time NBA All-Star.

Chris Finch

Finch has spent nine years as an assistant coach in the NBA, including the last three season with the Pelicans. He spent the 2019-20 season in the associate head coach role.

Prior to landing with the Pelicans, Finch spent five season with Houston Rockets from 2011-2016. He is also considered a contributing factor in helping the Denver Nuggets improve their offensive efficiency rating from 105.6 to 113.2 in 2016-17 during his only season with the team.

Finch spent two season coaching the Rio Grande Valley Vipers from 2009-2011, compiling 67-33 record at the helm. He was named 2010 D-League Coach of the Year.

Dave Joerger

Joerger has six years of experience as a head coach in the NBA, spending 2013-16 with the Memphis Grizzlies and 2016-19 with the Sacramento Kings. He spent six years as an assistant coach with the Grizzlies before landing his first head coaching job with the team.

His first run as a head coach fared better than his second, compiling a 147-99 mark through three years and a trip to the playoffs in each season. Joerger improved the Grizzlies' defensive efficiency rating from eighth (105.47) in 2013-14 to third (102.90) in 2014-15.

While in Sacramento, Joerger's teams never reached the postseason and he was 98-148 in three seasons. Grumblings about player management plagued his tenure in Sacramento, as he tended to play veterans over younger players.

During his time between the Continental Basketball Association and the NBA's D-League, Joerger won three titles with the Dakota Wizards and one with the Sioux Falls Skyforce.
