        "text": "I am attending Oconee Fall Line Technical College to pursue an associate degree to become a Diesel Technician. I am in my second semester at OFTC, and my experience with them has been amazing so far. The staff is helpful and understanding with meeting all my academic and financial needs and/or concerns. The instructors for my Diesel Technician classes are helpful and patient with all the students. They explain everything well to ensure we understand the innerworkings of how diesel mechanics work, ensuring our success in this field. The instructors for my online core classes are helpful as well. They provide us with clear instruction on assignments, leaving no room for misunderstanding, and offer help with the things we do not understand. This is especially helpful to me, personally, because I have never been the most gifted in understanding technology. Overall, everyone at OFTC is fulfilling their roles as mentors and advocates for the students efficiently. No change is needed at OFTC."
