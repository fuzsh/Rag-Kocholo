        "text": "Last Updated on June 26, 2024.\n\nIn this article, you can find all GED prep class locations and testing centers in the Augusta, Georgia, region. Georgia uses two options for High School Equivalency testing: the GED and HiSET exams.\n\nThe exams give individuals who could not finish their regular high school curriculum a chance to earn an equivalent degree.\n\nThe GED test is only available in a computer-based format, whereas the HiSET can be taken on a computer or on paper.\n\nThe GED consists of four separate tests in these academic fields:\n\nLanguage Arts\n\nMathematics\n\nSocial Studies\n\nScience\n\nHiSET testing comes with five subtests, as the Literacy section has separate writing and reading subtests.\n\nYou have the option to sit for one of the four GED or five HiSET subtests at a time if you wish.\n\nBest GED Classes proudly hosts over 100 of Onsego’s online GED classes at no cost to help you start out on the road to your GED diploma. With our free support, you can learn if an online course works for you.\n\nIf it does, register with Onsego, an accredited, affordable GED prep course that’ll get you properly prepared in no time! If online learning is not your thing, contact one of the facilities listed on this page to study with an instructor.\n\nOnline GED and HiSET testing is now available as well. It used to be that you had to come to an official GED testing site in person, but the introduction of GED or HiSET testing formats has changed that.

There was simply no option to take the test online, and Georgia only offered the GED recently. Your personal appearance was needed if you wanted to take and pass the GED exam.\n\nNow, this has changed as Georgia also welcomed the HiSET exam for HSE (High School Equivalency) testing, and new online GED and HiSET test-taking options were also introduced. When using this online format, a proctor will help you throughout the test and check if all goes according to the regulations.\n\nTo learn more about online GED testing, go to this article -> ‘The online GED test’ and to read more about the online HiSET-At-Home, <- check here.\n\nAugusta Area GED Testing Centers\n\nAugusta Technical College (Building 1300, Room 209, check-in at Student Records)\n\n3200 Augusta Tech Dr – Augusta – GA 30906 – Ph (706) 771-4153\n\nFrom here, cities by alphabet\n\nBamberg-Barnwell Adult Education GED Test Center\n\n10370 Ellenton St – Barnwell – SC 29812 – Ph (803) 541-6021\n\nAiken County Adult Education\n\n2432 Jefferson Davis Hwy – Graniteville – SC 29829 – Ph (803) 663-4920\n\nEdgefield County Adult Education\n\n117 Cardinal St – Johnston – SC 29832 – Ph (803) 275-4158\n\nSaluda County Adult Education GED Test Site\n\n401 North Calhoun St – Saluda – SC 29138 – Ph (864) 362-6080\n\nWashington-Wilkes Career Ctr (Athens Technical College)\n\n22 Lexington Ave – Washington – GA 30673 – Ph (706) 583-2551"
