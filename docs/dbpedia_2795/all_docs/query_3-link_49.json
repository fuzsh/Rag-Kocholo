        "text": "Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) and Georgia Military College (GMC) signed an articulation agreement to continue expanding educational opportunities for students in the state of Georgia. This agreement marks the 18th articulation agreement that GMC has signed with a technical college in the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG). GMC’s goal is to have agreements in place with all 22 colleges within the TCSG.\n\nThe goal of the articulation agreement is to provide Associate of Applied Science (AAS) graduates of select Ogeechee Technical College programs with an opportunity to continue with Georgia Military College to earn a Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree. Under the agreement, any OTC student graduating with their AAS degree and having at least 24 semester hours (36 quarter hours) of technical/occupational credit accepted as transfer credit by GMC, is guaranteed admission into one of GMC’s BAS degree programs in Business Management or Supervision and Management.\n\n“We are happy to be able to offer our graduates this additional opportunity to leverage their education at Ogeechee Technical College into a higher degree,” stated OTC president, Lori Durden. “With a focus on workforce development, many of our graduates go to work right out of OTC, but for those who desire to continue their education, this new collaborative with GMC is an additional opportunity to succeed.”\n\nThis agreement formally recognizes that Ogeechee Technical College and Georgia Military College are committed to the establishment of an educational partnership to better serve currently enrolled and future students at both institutions, as well as, support economic and workforce development in the communities served by these educational institutions.\n\n“We are thrilled to launch this partnership with Ogeechee Technical College to serve the students of Georgia,” said Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell, IV, president of Georgia Military College. “Our BAS degrees are designed to build upon the occupational/technical education provided by an associate of applied science (AAS) degree program and provide an excellent pathway toward completion of a bachelor degree. Our BAS degree programs prepare students for career advancement opportunities and management and supervisory roles in their technical or occupational field. This partnership with OTC is another step in providing greater opportunities and a brighter future for the citizens of Georgia and is consistent with Gov. Nathan Deal’s Complete College Georgia initiative designed to provide an improved educational pipeline from high school through college graduation.”\n\nIn addition to this new agreement with Ogeechee Technical College, Georgia Military College also has articulation agreements in place with the following technical colleges within the TCSG:\n\nAlbany Technical College\n\nAtlanta Technical College\n\nAugusta Technical College\n\nCentral Georgia Technical College\n\nCoastal Pines Technical College\n\nGeorgia Northwestern Technical College\n\nGeorgia Piedmont Technical College\n\nGwinnett Technical College\n\nNorth Georgia Technical College\n\nOconee Fall Line Technical College\n\nSavannah Technical College\n\nSouth Georgia Technical College\n\nSoutheastern Technical College\n\nSouthern Crescent Technical College\n\nSouthern Regional Technical College\n\nWest Georgai Technical College\n\nWiregrass Georgia Technical College\n\nAdditionally, in an effort to expand the educational opportunities for AAS degree holders to pursue a 4-year degree, GMC will offer its newest Bachelor of Applied Science degree program in Supply Chain Management and Logistics beginning in August 2017. This degree program is designed to provide technical college graduates with another opportunity to build on their AAS degree for careers in supply chain management, logistics, and related fields in today’s global business and industry environment. This degree program will be offered at GMC’s Augusta, Columbus, Dublin, Eastman, Fairburn, Fayetteville, Milledgeville, Online, Warner Robins, and Valdosta campuses.
