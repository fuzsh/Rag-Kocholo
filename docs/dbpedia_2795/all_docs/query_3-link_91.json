        "text": "​Home, School, Community - Partners In Lifelong Learning\n\nWashington County High School is a public school for students in 9th through 12th Grade.\n\n​It is the vision of Washington County High School to encourage an educational partnership among the school, community, and parents, which will create and maintain an environment that will enable students to be safe, respectful, and responsible in a global society.\n\nWashington County Board of Education\n\nWashington County High School\n\nAcademics\n\nWashington County High School has a long history of excellence in academics as well as extra-curricular activities. They offer a wide range of courses, from the traditional school courses to more niche courses like wood-working, agriculture, and visual arts.\n\nThey believe that by educating and encouraging students to think and ask questions instead of only teaching memorization and test-taking skills, they have equipped their students to be more successful in schools of higher education and the job market.\n\nAthletics\n\nAs a Public AAA High School, WCHS is well-known for its athletic accolades.\n\nIt has grown multiple professional athletes, has won over 20 State and Region Championships, and offers a wide array of athletic programs, ranging from football to gymnastics.\n\nStudent Life\n\nBy insisting that students actively participate in both their school and their communities, Washington County High School strives to make them aware of their own potential and the needs of others.\n\n\"Enter our doors as a child; exit our doors as a well-rounded and productive citizen.\"\n\nDr. Rickey Edmond\n\nSuperintendent\n\n\"We are the Golden Hawks. Rising higher in the sky to meet every challenge. We are fierce and strong. We are determined. Our mission is to excel in Academics, Arts, and Athletics. This year we will rise to new heights. We will achieve new levels of greatness. ​This is the time to shine. To RISE UP and soar to the highest of heights. I believe in your children, in the power that they have to change the world. ​Please join me in supporting our students as they are challenged in the classroom, through various artistic platforms, and on the athletic field. I look forward to watching them grow into the strong, intelligent, and capable individuals that they truly are.\""
