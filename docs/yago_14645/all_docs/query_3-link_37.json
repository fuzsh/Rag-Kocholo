He graduated from Byron High School in 1981 as Valedictorian and attended St. Mary’s University in Winona, MN where he earned his degree in computer science. He married Deborah Lee Sonsalla in 1989, and they had daughters Giovanna and Simone Sonsalla.\n\nJeffrey worked for Cray, SGI, and Code 42 as a successful computer engineer and became Senior VP. His knowledge in Mathematics and his leadership expertise lead the companies through many successful projects. For his second career, he became a well loved math teacher.\n\nFrom a young age, Jeff was an esteemed musician. He was proficient in trumpet, piano, guitar, and many other instruments. He raised his daughters to be musicians as well, and would gig at various venues with his band Mixed Emotions.\n\nJeff was fiercely passionate about his daughters dreams and encouraged them to go to school abroad. He helped pave the way for daughter Giovanna to receive a PhD in neuroscience, and for daughter Simone to pursue a successful career in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. His support was unparalleled. He had a very strong faith and was a part of St. Joseph’s Catholic Church. He instilled strong faith principles in his daughters and would say the rosary each night. He also put in many hours volunteering at the Dorothy Day Center in St. Paul, MN.\n\nJeff is survived by his wife, Deborah; two daughters, Giovanna and Simone; mother, Shirley; sister, Jayne Ferlitsch; brother, Joseph Sonsalla and many beloved nieces, nephews and cousins. He was preceded in death by his father, Richard Sonsalla.\n\nThe funeral service will be held on 11:00 AM, Sunday, April 16th at Henry W Anderson Mortuary, 14850 Garrett Ave., Apple Valley, MN with visitation 1/2 hour before service, followed by a reception.
