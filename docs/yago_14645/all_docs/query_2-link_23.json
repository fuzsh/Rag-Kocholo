        "text": "passed away on Sunday, April 12, 2015 at his home on Bainbridge Island, Washington. He was born on June 23, 1937 in Wyoming and was 77 years of age. Arrangements are pending through Cook Family Funeral Home.Born in Gebo, Wyoming, Byron had a colorful childhood. Before graduating high school, he had lived in many states and many small towns, and even on a few farms. Losing his father when he was just 13 years old, Byron, along with his beloved little sister Cathy, were raised by a diverse village of relatives including his very hard working mother and the best friend he ever knew, his older brother Bob. As an adult, Byron worked hard in places, ranging from coal mines to university campuses, ultimately becoming a well-respected professional, husband, and father. As a pioneer in the application of computer technology, Byron excelled at work, managing impressive projects ranging from national defense missile programs to the space station. Byron and his first wife, Frances, had four children each of whom have had success in their own right. He is dearly loved by his two daughters, two sons, four nieces, and three grandchildren, all of whom he loved very much and can certainly relay fond memories of him.He was lucky enough to find true love a second time in his life and married Judy, whom he spent his last couple of decades with on Bainbridge Island, enjoying his time golfing, traveling, performing public service, and loving his family. His friends are innumerable, and his memory will live on in his community.Byron had a zest for life. He loved family, golf, and the Huskies, (in that order, unless it had been a really bad day on the course). We love you Dad, Brother, Husband, Uncle, Grandfather, and Friend; we will miss you.A Memorial Service to celebrate Byron's life will be held at Grace Episcopal Church 8595 NE Day Rd Bainbridge Island, WA 98110 at 3 pm on May 9th."
