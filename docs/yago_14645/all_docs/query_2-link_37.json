        "text": "Jeff Walter Smith, a beloved resident of Macon, GA, was born on April 26, 1960, in Lyons, GA, and peacefully passed away on January 14, 2024, after bravely facing a long illness. Jeff departed this world surrounded by his loved ones and in the arms of his wife, Dorena, on their 40th wedding anniversary. Jeff’s departure leaves a void that can never be filled, and we mourn the loss of a remarkable individual whose presence touched the lives of all who knew him.\n\nJeff is survived by his devoted wife of 40 years, Dorena Raimondi Smith, and their loving children: Brittnee (James) Dixon, Tarra Smith (Drew Dominguez), Brandon Smith, and Nicolle Smith. He leaves a lasting legacy through his cherished grandchildren, Kayden Jacob Smith, Karli Maze Dominguez, Kali Marie Dixon, and the anticipated arrival of future grandchild Kash Walter Dixon; as well as his beloved granddoggies Huey, Luna, and Bernie. He was a dedicated nephew to his Aunt Virginia Jennings, brother to his sister Cindy Smith Bresee (Stuart), uncle to his nieces and nephew Sara Bresee, Allie Bresee, Kaitlin Bresee, and Anthony Raimondi, son-in-law to Beatrice Raimondi, brother-in-law to Dino Raimondi, and employer to the Jeff Smith Auto Family. He was preceded in death by his brother Perry Stuart Smith, his parents, John and Carolyn Smith, and father-in-law Salvatore Raimondi.\n\nJeff spent his formative years in Morrow, GA and laid the foundation for a remarkable journey. From his role as the committed manager of his father's sports teams to rising as the quarterback of the high school football team, Jeff's passion for sports was evident. His prowess extended beyond the football field, showcasing unparalleled skill as a point guard in basketball, earning him the nickname \"Hot Hands Smith.\" Beyond the realm of athletics, Jeff emerged as a true Renaissance man, including gracing the high school musical stage. His remarkable athletic talents were not just a testament to his physical ability, but a reflection of an unwavering determination that defined his approach to every endeavor, making him a source of inspiration for all who knew him.\n\nHis leadership qualities were recognized from the start when he entered the Air Force in 1981, where he was given the responsibility to oversee his barracks during basic training, ensuring his team ran smoothly, fulfilled their daily duties, and excelled in their goals. He went on to become Special Police for the military, working on bases in Alaska, Nevada, and Texas. When he completed his time in the Air Force in 1985 he departed as a Senior Airman. He credits serving our country as what helped him mature into the disciplined man he became, but more importantly, this is when he met the love of his life, Dorena, and they began their life together.\n\nThey first met in Alaska in 1983, and got married in 1984 in Las Vegas. Post-military service, he embraced the world of real estate until 1989, and during that time they welcomed the arrival of their first two children. Faced with the challenges of supporting a growing family, he made a courageous move to Macon, venturing into car sales. Undeterred by initial struggles, his unwavering determination paid off in nine years when he realized his dream of owning a dealership, creating Jeff Smith Nissan. Over the years, his entrepreneurial spirit thrived, expanding his ownership to six additional car franchises across Byron, Warner Robins, and Perry.\n\nSecond to his entrepreneurial spirit, was his generosity and dedication to his neighbors. He had a passion for creating opportunities for young people to grow in the same ways he did, sponsoring multiple sports teams for schools across the city, coaching several softball teams throughout the years, and acting as a board member of the Warner Robins’ Museum of Aviation. He was actively involved in supporting the local economy, serving as a member of the Warner Robbins Chamber of Commerce, as well as sponsoring the National State Fair and Rodeo.\n\nHe donated and managed fundraisers for causes close to his heart, such as the Juvenile Diabetes Association, The United Way of Central Georgia, and the American Cancer Society. Not only was he a passionate philanthropist, he was a creative one as well, always looking for opportunities to educate, build community, and bring people together. This was demonstrated with the Jeff Smith Classic Golf Tournament for Type 1 diabetes in honor of his son, Brandon, and his multiple car giveaway initiatives in honor of the United Way of Central Georgia and for students at Central Georgia Technical College. His impact on the community extended beyond business, as he was remembered by all as an extremely kind, caring individual who took care of everyone in his orbit.\n\nA memorial service to celebrate Jeff's life will be held at Fall Line Station on February 4th at 2:00 PM, officiated by Elder James Williams. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations in Jeff's name to the Juvenile Diabetes Association, The United Way of Central Georgia, and the American Cancer Society. Jeff's memory will forever live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.\n\nFall Line Station is located at 567 Plum Street, Macon, GA 31201, with private reception to follow. Casual attire is welcome; there will be an Open Mic portion of the afternoon where guests will be encouraged to share their fondest memories of Jeff.\n\nPlease visit www.hartsmort.com to express condolences.\n\nHart’s at the Cupola, Hart's Mortuary and Cremation Center, 6324 Peake Rd, Macon, GA 31210 has charge of the arrangements."
