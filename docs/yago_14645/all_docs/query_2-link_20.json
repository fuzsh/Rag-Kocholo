        "text": "Byron Robert Steiber\n\nFebruary 9, 1950- December 12, 2023\n\nOur beloved husband, father, and grandfather Byron Robert Steiber, age 73, passed away surrounded by family, on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. Born in Waukon, Iowa, to Frederick and Marjorie Jean (Maust) Steiber, Byron's journey was grounded in the values cultivated on the Steiber family farm in Lansing, Iowa.\n\nAfter graduating from Kee High School in 1968, Byron pursued higher education at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville and Westmar College in Le Mars, Iowa. In college, he pursued not only his love of learning but also his lifelong love, Kathleen Ellen Johnson, whom he married in 1970 in Humboldt, Iowa.\n\nByron was a true \"Jack of all Trades\" and had several different roles throughout his career. He spent many years working in agricultural management and was always an advocate for the small family farm. Byron and his wife, Kathleen, renovated an old building in Hubbard, Iowa, and opened Das Hubbard Haus, a restaurant where they fine-tuned their favorite family recipes. His diverse career also included collection of environmental soil samples, residential facility management, heating and cooling work, and Campus Supervisor of Plant Services at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls, Iowa. Byron's legacy is one of tireless dedication and hard work, and he impacted all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone, Byron finally retired in 2018 and had the time to go camping, work on home renovation, and spend more time with his family. He was a lifelong learner who loved his coffee, listening to music, and was an avid vegetable and flower gardener, just like his late mother, Jean.\n\nByron's role as a husband, father, and grandfather was infused with humor and a genuine love for life. He is survived and missed by his loving wife, Kathleen, and feline companion, Watson, who shared the home he helped renovate in Iowa Falls. Byron was not just a hero, but also a cherished friend and mentor to his 3 daughters Lisa (Boyd) Barsness, of St. Louis Park, Minnesota, Jenna (Aaron) Koenigsfeld, of Iowa Falls, Iowa and Laura (Brian) Dolan, of Hubbard, Iowa.\n\nByron's impact extended beyond his daughters, leaving a lasting mark on his sons-in-law Boyd (Lisa), Aaron (Jenna), and Brian (Laura) who loved talking with him and getting DIY advice for their home projects. His absence will also be deeply felt by his six adored grandchildren, Mina (Lisa), Chase, Kyli, Kymri (Jenna), and Daniel and Katie (Laura) who were the light of his life. Byron was often seen smiling proudly at his grandchildren's sports events, concerts, and theatre performances.\n\nHe cherished his moments shared with his sister and husband, Cheryl and Gary Blythe, his brother and wife, Daryl and Pam Steiber, and his late brother Alan and wife Terisa Steiber. Byron is also survived by his in-laws Barb and Dan Kratz, Carol (Daniel) Johnson, Nancy (Jeffrey) Filkins, and numerous nieces, nephews, cousins, and dear friends.\n\nByron now joins his parents, Frederick and Jean Steiber, along with other departed loved ones, including his brothers Eric Steiber and Alan Steiber, father and mother-in-law Roland and Faith Johnson, and brothers-in-law Richard Johnson, Daniel Johnson, and Jeffrey Filkins.\n\nIn honoring his life, his family requests to carry forward Byron's positivity and caring spirit by doing an unsolicited act of kindness for someone in his name.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at a later date. Memorial donations given in honor of Byron will be left to the family's discretion. To share a special memory or condolence, please visit www.ranfranzandvinefh.com."
