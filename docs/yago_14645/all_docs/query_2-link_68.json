        "text": "Jeffrey Griffin Robinson, 63, of Coal Valley, Illinois, passed away Sunday, November 19, 2023, surrounded by his family.\n\nA remembrance gathering to celebrate Jeff’s life will be 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. Sunday, December 10, at CityView Celebrations at Trimble Pointe, 701 12th Street, Moline. The celebration will begin in the parking lot at 2:00 p.m. with military honors conducted by Vietnam Veterans of the Quad Cities Chapter #299. The family will greet friends from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. and the celebration will conclude with a time of sharing beginning at 4:00 p.m. Memorials may be made to the family for a fund to be established in Jeff’s memory.\n\nJeffrey Griffin Robinson was born July 20, 1960, in Burlington, Iowa, the son of Griffin John and Pamela (Sharp) Robinson. He proudly served his country in the U.S. Navy as a submariner. On August 17, 1985, he married the love of his life, Michelle Stozek, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nProfessionally, Jeff began his career with Smith Engineering, one of the pioneering air pollution control equipment manufacturers. However, driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to make a positive impact, he went on to establish Environmental Services & Technologies in 1993. His work was not just a job; it was a passion. Jeff believed in being proactive rather than reactive, and his dedication to his customers was unparalleled.\n\nJeff will be remembered as honorable, compassionate, authentic, loyal, as well as ornery. He touched the lives of those he encountered, effortlessly engaging with others and creating lasting connections.\n\nHe found joy in exploring the world, with a particular love for the Cayman Islands, where he indulged in his passion for scuba diving. Yet, above all else, family held the utmost importance in Jeff's life. He was the \"family fortress,\" a pillar of strength, and the glue that bound the family together. His devotion to his grandchildren, affectionately known as \"his rats,\" was evident in the joy and laughter they shared.\n\nJeff is survived by his beloved wife of over 38 years, Michelle; five children, Meagan (Jeremy) Nolen of Orion, Illinois, Morgan Robinson of Coal Valley, Mallory (Alex Fetter) Robinson of Winston Salem, North Carolina, Taylor (Anthony Shoff) Robinson of Coal Valley, and Blaine (Andrea Garcia) Robinson of Coal Valley; his six grandchildren, Kaedyn and Kazimiera Nolen, Merrick Pizano, Althea Fetter, and Theseus and Thane Shoff; three siblings, John (Sheri) Robinson of Cordova, Illinois, Lorri (Rod) Stalsberg of Port Byron, Illinois, and Lynne (Bill) Miller; and Howard Nelson of the Cayman Islands and nephew, Dougie Lefler, who were like sons to Jeff. He was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nThe family invites friends to share stories and condolences at TrimbleFuneralHomes.com."
