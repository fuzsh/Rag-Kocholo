Not did she help us get an offer on our home home within hours of listing it, but one that was above what we felt was a good asking price that had been established in a rigorous way. We had competing offers almost immediately and she struck a good balance between waiting to see what other offers would surface and accepting among them which ultimately produced an enhanced offer that we accepted. She also recommended staging the home and arranged for the stagers; a process that we felt really improved the way the home was perceived and was likely another key to getting such a positive outcome. And she identified some permit issues that required some alterations and might have delayed the closing had we not addressed them before listing and she helped as source the architect and contractor we hired to do that. As important, she was friendly, easy to work with throughout the process and was always very responsive.”\" - Diane & Russ, Larchmont Manor\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Mary Gail helped us list and sell our home in Larchmont.

The relationship didn’t stop at the -- she welcomed us into the community, proactively introducing us to other new families, and connected us with local service providers to help renovate our new home.”\" - Angela & John, Larchmont\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Mary Gail Barry is an outstanding realtor. As a long-time Larchmont resident, she seems to know everything a client could possibly want to learn about Larchmont and the surrounding communities. She is a responsive, knowledgeable, thorough, and ethical problem solver who always seems to find an acceptable solution to the myriad of issues that crop up on any real estate transaction. Above all, Mary Gail always represents the best interests of her clients, and my husband and I trust her completely. You won't find a more accomplished professional in the Larchmont area to represent you on either the purchase or of your home. We cannot recommend her highly enough\" - Jeanne & Artie, Mamaroneck\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Rarely do you find a residential real estate agent in suburban NY, who really knows the market. Why? Because, even if they are \"expert\" in a market, they are too busy \"selling\" or \"closing\", and rarely listening! Mary Gail listens, studies, thinks dynamically and out works most of her peers in serving her client. She discovers buyer AND seller preferences, trends, and the particular needs of a client. Top notch, could not have done it without her!”\" - Leigh and Bob, Mamaroneck"
