        "text": "A Bryon family is suffering through the pain and devastation of having not one, but two family members diagnosed with cancer.\n\nJeff Martinez and his wife Ronna grew up down the street from one another. The couple has been married 14 years and shared they have shared a lot during that time.\n\nBut now, they share something very more dangerous.\n\nThe couple, both 45-years-old, was recently diagnosed with cancer, just a couple of months apart.\n\n\"July 27th. He had told me three weeks prior to that that he...and for him to voice any complaints about his physical wellbeing, I knew there was something up,\" Said Ronna Martinez.\n\n\"The room started spinning. I couldn't believe that I was hearing what I was hearing,\" Said Jeff Martinez.\n\nJeff, a techer at warner robins Middle School, said he was diagnosed with stage 2 esophageal cancer.\n\n\"It's the type of cancer that affects the mucous producing organs of your body,\" he said.\n\nJust a few weeks later, Ronna, at nurse at Endoscopy Center of Middle georgia, said she found out she has stage 2 breast cancer.\n\n\"I was in the shower and felt a lump in my breast,\" she said.\n\nJeff recently finished a round of chemotherapy and radiation and is awaiting a follow-up with a cardiothoracic surgeon at Emory Hospital, where they will remove his esophagus.\n\nRonna is recovering after having a radical mastectomy to her left breast.\n\n\"It had invaded into my lymph node. Just one actually, thank goodness.\"\n\nThe couple said it's difficult explaining to their 6-year-old daughter what's happening with mommy and daddy.\n\n\"We've explained it to her on a 6-year-old level. We haven't actually told that we have cancer. We have told her that we have parts of our body that are sick and that we're going to have to have surgery and have those parts taken out,\" Jeff Martinez said.\n\nThe couple said getting the bad news from the doctor was difficult to hear.\n\n\"That was probably the hardest day so far when we went to see the surgeon. He said, 'You know, I'm not going to lie to you.' He said about 85%, only 85% of people live pass four years,\" Jeff Martinez said.\n\nThe couple said they will continue fighting to beat the odds because they want to be around for their daughter a very long time.\n\n\"I've been doing exceptionally well. My body tolerated the chemo very well,\" Jeff Martinez said.\n\n\"I pray a lot and I think about her. I just try to be happy. She is what's keeping us going and keeping us positive. Because I will not leave her,\" Ronna Martinez said.\n\nThe couple is also taking care of Ronna's mother, who suffered a stroke in 2005 when Hurricane Wilma ripped off the second floor of her mother's south Florida home.\n\nFriends have organized a fundraiser for the Martinez family. It will be held Tuesday, November 17th at 5:00 p.m. at The Blacksmith Shop, 665 Poplar Street, in Macon.\n\nThey have also setup a GoFundMe account to help the family pay for medical expenses.\n\nClick to donate.\n\nYou can also send donations to this P.O. Box:\n\n4339 Hartley Bridge Road #198\n\nMacon, GA 31216"
