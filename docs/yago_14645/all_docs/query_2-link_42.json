        "text": "Byron Blain Wilson was born on April 28, 1964 to William B and Monetta Wilson and passed away June 11.\n\nHe spent his early days on the family ranch in Iraan, TX and moved to Midland where he began elementary school at Trinity Episcopal with child friends that still remain today. He graduated from Midland High School and then attended Midland College. When Byron was a young boy he wanted a dirt bike. He went to his father and ask him for one and his father said “I’ll not have a son of mine not knowing how to ride a horse while living on the ranch, so learn to ride a horse and we will talk about the dirt bike.” So he did and his love for horses remained throughout the rest of his life. Byron began playing Polo when he was nine years old and played his first tournament at age ten in India. He continued his love for the sport throughout his life until he lost his eyesight to Diabetes and then ultimately led to dialysis. His last game was his hardest ever, because as he came off the field crying he knew it was his last time. Byron was fortunate to play polo all over the world. From the Argentina to England to India and China and many, many places in between. He had dear friends from all over the world and was admired by his ability and sportsmanship on and off the field. He was a Club Pro in many US polo clubs and played in numerous charity polo events. He played the East Coast (Palm Springs/ Wellington up to Illinois to New York) to the West Coast (Santa Barbara, Indio and San Diego) to the North in Wyoming & Washington to the South in Texas and all over the United States and in between, with his home club, as a player and owner, always being Midland. Byron’s love for horses was his life and helping others to have the opportunity to play the sport he loved was such a joy to him, never wanting anything in return.\n\nIn 1995 Byron married the love of his life, Laura. They had two beautiful daughters, Amy and Ana, they both are so very proud of. Together they loved traveling, summers in Jackson Hole and Skaneateles, and being close to one another all the time and knowing that “home” was wherever the four were together. Byron loved everyone. He was one to see good in those that others passed by and always ready to lend a helping hand. We were honored that Byron was able to be a tissue donor to give eyesight to two others. Byron is preceded in death by his parents and grandparents, John William Wilson, II & Nancy Belle Word and O. B. & Ruth Bradshaw. He is survived by his wife Laura, daughters Amy Wilson and Ana Wilson Semper and husband Juan, who Byron immediately loved, his brothers Bill and wife Nikki, Duke and wife Linda, Word and wife Celia, and Mike and wife Laura Ann. He is also survived by numerous nieces, nephews, cousins and friends all whom he loved dearly.\n\nA celebration of his life will be held at Nalley- Pickle & Welch Funeral Home, The Branch, Friday June 18th, 2021 at 10:00 am officiated by Blaine Sheppard.\n\nHonorary Pallbearers are Lourcey Sams, Stephen Wilson, Tom Brown, John Wilson, Marcos Villinuvea, Marty Cregg, Craig Ramsby, Jeff Korson, Tad Hillin, Logan Simmons, Juan Semper, Julian Aguilar, Cristobal Juntas, Fortunito Gómez Romero, Alejandro Olmos, Herman Tarin, Dan Gandy, George Patton, Tommy Higgins, Cary Hale.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations may be made to Work to Ride, Inc. 98 Chamounix Drive Philadelphia, PA 19131 website: www.worktoride.net or Recording Library of West Texas or a charity of your choice.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Nalley-Pickle & Welch Funeral Home & Crematory of Midland.
