        "text": "June 1 to 5, 2016\n\nI had a wonderful time at this year’s four-day Cinevent film festival in Columbus, Ohio. I arrived on June 1st and was there early enough to see the two films that were being shown at the Wexner Center for the Arts, part of the Ohio State University. Each year, at least for the past three years that I have attended Cinevent, they invite their attendees to screen these films the night before the festival begins.\n\nSo the first film we saw was HOTEL SAHARA (1951) directed by Ken Annakin, featuring Yvonne De Carlo and Peter Ustinov. It was a somewhat black comedy (if we consider it’s about war) about a group of people who run a hotel in the Sahara during WWII. The hotel, in the middle of nowhere, was a place the elite could get away to, to while away the hours dancing, gambling, drinking and eating. It’s run by Emad (Peter Ustinov), his fiancée Yasmin Pallas (Yvonne De Carlo), her mother Mme. Pallas (Mireille Perrey) along with a couple of other Arab staff.\n\nWhen the hotel’s lookout informs Emad that an Italian platoon is heading their way, everyone is evacuated. Emad and his male staff are also ready to split, but Yasmin and her mother are more practical minded and convince Emad to stay and make the most out of the situation. After all, the hotel is their bread and butter so why let it get destroyed by warring troops with no compensation. They just make sure to hide their silver.\n\nWhen I was a youngster, I didn’t like Peter Ustinov for the simple reason that he didn’t look like a movie star. But since then, reading some of his writings and seeing him again in film, I find him totally charming. He doesn’t disappoint as Emad.\n\nAs well, I grew up only knowing De Carlo as Mrs. Munster but never found her as glamorous as Morticia Adams. In HOTEL SAHARA she not only shows off her talent for accents, singing, dancing and comedy, but she is absolutely stunning.\n\nShe is definitely the one you watch when she’s on the screen. Her and her mother’s role are to woo the Italian soldiers. Yasmin knows how to dress to “accommodate” whichever man she’s decided to ensnare.\n\nHer mother, rather sweetly, charms any man who is interested in helping in the kitchen. They both take extremely well to their assignments, much to Emad’s chagrin with special regard to his fiancée’s amusement.\n\nJust as the Italian troop is settling in, a British platoon is spotted heading through the desert their way and the band of hotel owners must find a way to send off their Italian guests by any ruse that comes to mind. They do, and in come Captain Puffin Cheyne (David Tomlinson) and Major Bill Randall (Roland Culver), both vying for the affections of Miss Yasmin. And she knows how to play them both.\n\nSuffice to say that this continues on with the Germans (enjoyable to watch Yasmin easily figure out how to ensnare Lieutenant Gunther von Heilicke (Albert Lieven) when he first dismisses her as too provocative), the French who are sent on their way just as the American’s arrive.\n\nPoor Emad, and even Yasmin may tire of the game, while Mme. Pallas seems to be enjoying the attention most of all.\n\nThe second film of the evening was ALBERT R.N. (1953), directed by Lewis Gilbert, with Anthony Steel and Jack Warner. If there is any link between these two films other than that they were British, it’s that they each featured Anton Diffring as a German officer in both but with a major role here.\n\nIt’s been many years since I saw STALAG 17, made in the same year, but it immediately brought the film to mind. There are the similarities—prisoners of war held in German barracks, tunnel digging (as in THE GREAT ESCAPE [1963]) and men attempting to escape in other fashions, as well as the camaraderie. But of course there are differences too.\n\nThe major ploy for trickery in ALBERT R.N. is Geoff’s (Anthony Steel) idea of creating a papier-mâché replacement for any of the escapees. Capt. Maddox (Jack Warner) is the man who keeps the men in-line and sane. Texas (William Sylvester) is the only American prisoner, and a proud but at times obnoxious one that rubs some of the men some of the time the wrong way.\n\nThe villain is Hauptmann Schultz (Anton Diffring) who eventually replaces the more reasonable and fair Camp Kommandant (Frederick Valk) with deadly consequences.\n\nA good beginning to Cinevent, which would start at 1:00 pm the following day. And the very much anticipated visit to the dealers’ room!\n\nThursday, June 2, 2016 – Day 1\n\nThe first film was THE CRIME NOBODY SAW (1937) directed by Charles Barton, with Lew Ayres, Eugene Pallette and Hattie McDaniel. It’s the story of three playwrights huddled together in an apartment owned by one of them, Horace Dryden (Benny Baker), trying to work on the very first page of a draft for a murder mystery. Throughout the film, Horace, Nick Milburn (Lew Ayres) and Babe (Eugene Pallette) begin over and over again to come up with an acceptable “Page 1”. Babe is taken with the wife of the neighbour across the way, Mrs. Suzanne Duval (Vivienne Osborne) whose little pooch Toto(!) seems to seek Babe out. Theatre producer John Atherton (Ferdinand Gottschalk) isn’t fooled by the crazy off-the-cuff ramblings the three come up with on his first visit and he lets them know in no uncertain terms that they either come up with a first draft or return his $500 payment. Since they already spent the cash, they know what they have to do.\n\nInspiration comes when a highly intoxicated man enters their apartment, collapses on their couch with $15,000 discovered in his coat pocket and then shortly after is rediscovered dead, probably murdered! Others now enter the scene, William Underhill (Jed Prouty), a lingerie salesman, Dr. Randolph Brookes (Colin Tapley) and Robert Mallory (Howard C. Hickman) with his lovely daughter (and love interest for Ayers), Kay (Ruth Coleman) which happily gives us a number of suspects.\n\nThe three writers pretend to be a detective, a policeman and a doctor in order to solve this mystery and of course come up with a play to boot.\n\nWhere does Hattie McDaniel come in? Ambrosia (love her name) is the character to watch whenever she appears. She is funny when she eavesdrops and overhears the three playwrights come up with their murderous plots, acting as though she thinks it’s the real thing, and everywhere else ending when she trots out backwards through the door in the film’s final scene.\n\nFrom the Cinevent notes, here are a few interesting tidbits by my friend Michael Schlesinger:\n\nIn the mid-to-late-30s, Paramount was second to none when it came to turning out smart, snappy Bs, and this genial knock-off of Seven Keys to Baldpate is a fine way to kick off the weekend. Based on a play co-written by Ellery Queen that literally closed in Philadelphia…there’s a pretty snazzy plot twist down the road, and as long as you don’t think too hard about everything—the story has more holes than a sieve, which is likely why it flopped onstage—you should have a nifty time.\n\n…and best of all, there’s McDaniel as a maid named Ambrosia, who knows more than she’s letting on. (It’s actually a pretty sizable role, which must have given the famously bigoted Pallette fits.) Look quickly and you’ll also spot a young Ellen Drew as a secretary….\n\nNext up was MELODY CRUISE (1933), directed by Mark Sandrich, possibly my favourite film even though it starred the—I have to pretend he is attractive, and can sing—Phil Harris. Certainly every woman on the cruise ship went gaga over him. What’s so interesting for me is that later on we watched a film with Alice Faye and I recalled that she was the wife of Jack Benny’s band leader Phil Harris until his death. I finally put two-and-two together. I guess “handsomeness” wasn’t all it was cracked up to be since she was first married to good-looking Tony Martin who later married and remained so to lovely Cyd Charisse.\n\nOkay, back to MELODY CRUISE. It was a somewhat crazy and disconcerting story about a wealthy bachelor, Alan Chandler (Phil Harris) who’s travelling with his buddy Pete Wells (the wonderful Charlie Ruggles) on a cruise ship. The opening party scene in their luxurious state room is filled with all sorts of land lovers seeing them off. (An aside—I have been on many cruises and have never in my life seen any cabins like the ones that are portrayed in classic film. Were they really like that back then? They’re almost larger than most people’s apartments!) Everyone gets drunk and Pete comments to Alan that he is going to watch over him and protect him from ever getting married—ever! And to secure Pete to this promise while not having to avoid romantic liaisons with any woman who takes his fancy—even going as far as falling in love—Alan writes a letter to Pete’s wife listing all of Pete’s conquests. And this is not counting the ones before his marriage to Mrs. Wells (Marjorie Gateson) who is not on board, nor has attended the bon voyage party.\n\nThis decidedly does keep Pete busy for the rest of the cruise where not only all the young, gorgeous females (and there are plenty of them) think Alan’s the cat’s meow and who they all talk about in rhyming couplets. There are, as well, two particular women who Pete has to really look out for and keep away from Alan.\n\nOne is Elsa Von Rader (Greta Nissen), a sophisticated old flame who just happens to be on board and the innocent girl, Laurie Marlowe (Helen Mack), who’s chaperoned by Miss Potts (Florence Roberts).\n\nThe most fun elements of the film are both technical and sub-story-wise. The technical are the creative dissolves from scene to scene. They don’t just fade; they are patterned in truly artistic ways. The sub-story element is when two of the party revelers who should have left the ship the night before, Zoe (June Brewster) and Vera (Shirley Chambers) are discovered awaking from their drunken stupors after having passed out under fur coats in Pete’s stateroom. How does he explain this to the crew and, it is also discovered, Miss Potts who is dear friends with Pete’s brother and sister-in-law? And learns of this only moments after he tells her that Zoe and Vera are his nieces! They are rather promiscuous young women, with the funniest scene ending with the realization that they have been parading around deck in their lacy lingerie.\n\nSince seeing Chick Chandler in Blood Money (1933), I wondered why I hadn’t noticed this handsome man before. Here he plays Hickey, the “I can be of utmost service to you—for cash” steward.\n\nThe ending of the film is a visual joke, which I imagine is considered one of the special effects created by Vern Walker and Lyn Dunn.\n\nHere’s some interesting info from Jim Lane in the Cinevent notes:\n\nThe plot of this RKO pre-Code may be tissue-thin, but the execution gives it a gloss of frivolous fun. We can detect the influence of the previous year’s Love Me Tonight (screened at Capiotlfest last August) (from over at Paramount) right off the bat, as passengers in a shipping office negotiate for their respective cruses in a sort of recitative of rhyming dialogue, while the underlying music suggests a melody for their words that would become a song if anyone wanted to sing (the songs are credited to Val Burton and Will Jason). It happens again later as the ship sets sail, with the activities of the crew carefully choreographed to Max Steiner’s music, and later still as the ladies aboard (look sharp and you’ll catch a glimpse of 16-year-old Betty Grable) gossip about Alan Chandler in “He’s Not the Marrying Kind”. And in the picture’s one full-fledged song, sung by Phil Harris to Helen Mack as their ship waits its turn at the moonlit Panama Canal, both the title (“Isn’t It a Night for Love?”) and the staging are redolent of “Isn’t It Romantic?” from Love Me Tonight.\n\nMaking his screen debut here (if you don’t count an uncredited background bit as a nightclub drummer in 1929’s Why Be Good? with Colleen Moore), Phil Harris is younger, sleeker and smoother than the big loveable galoot we all remember from Jack Benny’s radio program and movies…\n\nWhen I go to these film events, my goal is to see all the feature films. However, at times I may be there in body, but not in spirit, and and even skipping the film shorts doesn’t always help. But regardless, I did decide to miss going to see the Fox Silent Shorts Compilation, instead heading to dealers’ room, upstairs for a rest and then out for a dinner.\n\nI came back in time to see the Laurel and Hardy short, THE HOOSE-GOW (1929), directed by James Parrott which had our two heroes working and causing mayhem on a chain-gang, not least by pouring raw rice into a car’s carbonator to create the most messy of messes.\n\nWriter Richard M. Roberts wrote in the Cinevent notes:\n\n…One mishap that remains in the film involves Ollie being hit in the seat of his pants by Stan’s pickax while they are chain-ganging. The fake pickax looked fake on film, so a real one had to be substituted. When the gag was shot, Ollie misjudged his distance from it when Stan swung for comic contact and the scream you hear from Ollie turned out to be genuine, getting a big laugh from the crew when the camera cut and before they realized what had happened. Comedy is frequently neither pretty nor safe.\n\nAt eighteen minutes, THE HOOSEGOW is the second shortest Laurel and Hardy comedy (County Hospital takes first prize at seventeen minutes), but every minute is comedy gold.\n\nTo view this short online, click here.\n\nI was really looking forward to seeing the next film, THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD (1934), directed by Alfred Werker, with George Arliss, Boris Karloff, Loretta Young, Robert Young and C. Aubrey Smith. I have a friend who is an actual descendent of the family and he has been doing research into his background. Well, now I know a bit about that family, although this is a Hollywood version and I don’t expect it to be too accurate but I’m sure George (my friend, not Arliss) would be delighted to fill me in on the differences.\n\nGeorge Arliss plays both the founding father, per se, Mayer, as well has his grown son, Nathan. A pious Jew who believes in making a profit while not charging exorbitant prices, he also does his best to hide his earnings from the taxman who demanded more from the people living in the Jewish ghetto than anywhere else in 1780 Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nArliss was 65 years old when he played these two roles. It was easy to see him as the patriarch Mayer, but I had to sustain my belief that he was, at the most, the 50-year-old Nathan. But I enjoy Arliss as an actor and so I sustained. And I believe it was an important film to be made at the time against major anti-Semitism, especially with Hitler and the rise of Nazism in Germany.\n\nThe Rothschilds were portrayed as a descent family who were smart bankers. Honestly, I didn’t understand many of the deals that they made or the scene where Nathan bet his and his brothers’ livelihood on buying up all stocks that came onto the market. But that knowledge isn’t important to have to enjoy the story. And the majority of us aren’t financiers.\n\nNathan was one of five brothers and their father instilled in them the bond of love and trust and the teaching that they would be more powerful and independent of being robbed by any middle-men transporting the money if they each set up a bank in the most important European cities of the time. So the family’s international banks were established by: Nathan in London, Solomon (Paul Harvey) in Vienna, Amschel (Ivan Simpson) in Frankfurt, Carl (Noel Madison) in Naples and James (Murray Kinnell) in Paris.\n\nThe personal part of the story revolves around Nathan and Hannah’s (George’s real-life wife Florence Arliss) daughter Julie (a gorgeous Loretta Young) and her love for a Gentile officer in the Duke of Wellington’s army, Captain Fitzroy (Robert Young).\n\nNathan has a hard time with his beloved daughter wanting to marry a man “not of their race” but eventually love won out, at least in the movies, since in real life Nathan had seven children, not one of them being a Julie. There was a Hannah, however, who did marry an Hon. Henry FitzRoy, so this must have been who Julie was based on.\n\nI enjoyed seeing some of the more common religious Jewish rituals being performed, especially the kissing of the Mezuzah every time one of the Rothschild’s exited a Jewish home.\n\nOne of the historical episodes of the film was Nathan Rothschild’s involvement in the Napoleonic Wars, with him almost single-handedly financing the British war effort as well as being in the position to pass on important news to the government.\n\nBoris Karloff played the tall, menacing, silver haired and eye-browed Count Ledrantz of Prussia.\n\nThe ending of the movie was filmed in Technicolor. And at a huge reception just after Nathan is honoured by the King himself, he complains to Hannah that he kneeled on the wrong knee. Hannah breaks out in a laugh, which only emphasized to me that one is born into this world to any random sort of station, but in the end we’re all just people who have to make the best of where we arrived.\n\nHere are some interesting Cinevent notes by Jim Lane:\n\n…George Arliss was, like his contemporary Marie Dressler, one of the most unusual movie stars of the 1920s and ‘30s—neither handsome nor young, but charming and witty, with a twinkling eye that nicely complemented and softened his typically English stiff upper lip. Born Augustus George Andrews in 1868, Arliss cut his teeth as an actor on British provincial stages in the days of Henry Irving and Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He made the transition from stage to screen with remarkable ease, and, thanks to his orotund elocutions, he moved just as easily from silent to talkies when sound came in. His signature stage role was as Queen Victoria’s favorite prime minister in Disraeli, which he filmed twice, as a silent in 1921 and a talkie eight years later (winning an Oscar the second time). Historical figures were a bit of a specialty–Disraeli and Alexander Hamilton before Nathan Rothschild, the Duke of Wellington and Cardinal Richelieu afterward—but, with appropriate changes in costume and hair style, they all seemed to look and sound pretty much like George Arliss. That was good enough for audiences in the 1930s, and time hasn’t dimmed the old boy’s charm; it’s good enough for us today.\n\n…Written by Nunnally Johnson from a play by George Hembert Westley (real name George Hippisley, a humor writer and editor for the Boston Evening Transcript), HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD has the distinction of being one of the first movies (probably in fact the very first) to deal with the subject of anti-Semitism—this, mind you, just as the Nazis were coming to power in Germany. Nathan and his brothers deal with Jew-haters again and again, epitomized by Boris Karloff as the reptilian Count Ledrantz of Prussia and personified by the rioting mobs Ledrantz sets on the Jews in their ghettos all across Europe—until Napoleon’s escape from Elba puts Nathan once more in the financial driver’s seat. The picture was a powerful argument for tolerance in 1934, and it looks even more powerful today in light of what we now know as to come.\n\n…THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD was a major hit and a success d’estime for 20th Century, Oscar-nominated for best picture (it lost to It Happened One Night). Reviewers hailed it as one of the best pictures of George Arliss’s career, maybe even the very best—a judgment that holds up today….\n\nTo view this film online, click here.\n\nNext up was THE CROWD (1928), directed by King Vidor, starring his wife at the time, Eleanor Boardman and James Murray.\n\nIt’s basically the story of the life of John Sims (James Murray) who we meet at his birth which falls on July 4th, 1900. Unless my eyes deceived me, there is no mistaking that the baby is boy when viewing the scene where we see him taking his first breath to being transferred to the swathing blanket!\n\nSeveral years pass when tragedy strikes for 12-year-old John with the death of his father. There is a decidedly gorgeous shot of a crowd of people standing at the foot of the entrance to the apartment building door where the Sims family live with John slowly making his way up towards the something he is hoping isn’t so.\n\nNow John is 21 and arriving in New York City, a place with 7,000,000 inhabitants. There is a wonderful shot travelling up a skyscraper with the camera zooming in on a window. Unlike Greg Toland’s continuous shot in Citizen Kane, there is a cut and now we are inside a huge office space with rows and rows of desks where we finally end up at John’s. He’s one of hundreds of drones doing some sort of tedious office accounting work; a contemporary reminiscence of 1927’s Metropolis workingman scenes.\n\nBut here is where the story really begins. In the amazingly huge wash-up lavatory, his workmate Bert (Bert Roach of Mack’s Sennett’s Keystone Cops) easily entices Jim to break from his evening studies and go on a double date with him and two “wrens”. And this is the core of John’s problem. His father told him he was going to grow up to be a somebody but he isn’t willing to put in the work. He thinks he stands out in a crowd and that failure won’t befall him. He and his date, Mary (Eleanor Boardman) hit it off pretty well right from the get go. I have seen Boardman in a number of films but what was striking to me in this one is that she so closely resembled Jane Curtain, only softer looking. With only myself to blame, it was odd and somewhat annoying to continue to be thinking this throughout the film.\n\nThere was a grand time to be had by the foursome at Coney Island: sliding down on magic carpets; merry-go-round horse racing; and ending in the tunnel of love. There’s a crowd standing around the disembarking area where a canopied sign saying “DO THEY NECK” rolls up to expose the kissing couples to the delight of their audience. Afterwards a proposition of marriage by John is accepted by Mary. Did people really decide to get married that fast back in those days?\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the rest of the film is the ins-and-outs, ups-and-downs of a young married couple, followed by two children. In one of their earlier fights, John heads off to work while Mary starts to pack threatening to move out. But of course that’s not what she really wants to do. Instead, she hangs out the window, calling him back up–she has something to tell him. He comes running back up and we see her mouth the words “I’m pregnant.” Interesting that the “P” word was not allowed to be said when talkies came out until, oh, maybe the 1960s.\n\nWe meet Mary’s mother (Lucy Beaumont) and two very, very older brothers Dick (Dell Henderson) and Jim (Daniel G. Tomlinson). She was definitely the baby of the family. None of them ever seem to approve of John and on their first Christmas Eve, he certainly does a good job of fermenting that impression, pun intended.\n\nJohn has one success of creating a commercially successful slogan which garnered the family a much-needed windfall but which sadly leads to the tragedy of the death of their little girl (Alice Mildred Puter).\n\nThat’s the only time I have great sympathy for John, when he has his breakdown that results in his losing his job. Otherwise, as likeable as he was when things were going well, he was basically lazy at heart with Mary doing all the detailed work of keeping the family together and making ends meet. No matter that this film was made in the late 1920’s, it’s a timeless story that people will always be able to relate to.\n\nThe story ends on an ambiguous note with John coming full circle with regards to learning to face his truth. Will John finally be able to pull himself together and support the family? Like Mary, we’re decidedly rooting for him!\n\nHere are some excerpts from Cinevent organizer Michael Haynes and my friend Samantha Glasser:\n\n…THE CROWD brought director King Vidor the first of three Oscar nominations in four years. Though he was nominated a total of five times, he was never handed one of the shiny gold statues until receiving a 1979 Academy Honorary Award. He cast his then-wife Eleanor Boardman as Mary in THE CROWD. Boardman had aimed for an acting career on the stage before catching Vidor’s eye as an “Eastman Kodak Girl.” After this film, she appeared in only a handful more movies, ending her career with 1935’s The Three Cornered Hat.\n\n“I didn’t care about ordinary people. I thought when you went into movies you wore curls and beautiful hats and gorgeous clothes, and [were[ glamorous,” Eleanor Boardman said. “Suddenly I was cast in this downtrodden Mary Doe meets John Doe story of boy and girl going through life, no money, no education, no knowledge of what they were doing. It was a job I had to do. I didn’t like to be so drab and unattractive. As I say the hair was hanging down with no makeup on. I didn’t object to it. I mean, inwardly I did, but I made no objection about it. I had confidence in Vidor and he knew what he was doing.”\n\nFor James Murray, his role as John Sims could have been a breakout role, but—much like his character in THE CROWD, personal issues including alcoholism haunted him and Murray’s career quickly faded into a series of bit parts. In 1936, he drowned in the Hudson River after falling from a pier. …\n\nThe last film of the evening was the little seen British film TOMORROW AT 10 (1962). Definitely worth staying up for. Directed by Lance Comfort, with a young-looking Robert Shaw.\n\nIt’s the story of an off-balanced man, Marlowe (Robert Shaw) who devices a devious plan to make a pile of money and escape his life in the UK. He kidnaps a rather sweet youngster, Jonathan Chester (Piers Bishop), a boy of about five years or so. Jonathan lives with his wealthy, widowed politician father, Anthony Chester (Alec Clunes) and is taken care of by his governess Robbie (Helen Cherry). When a new driver shows up to take Jonathan to school, Robbie accepts the explanation and sends the tyke on his way. Marlowe never scares the boy while leading him to an abandoned home where he’s set up a child-friendly room but with one sinister toy. It’s a golliwog, with a bomb inserted into the centre stuffing, metaphorically replacing Marlowe’s heart. His scheme is to demand, face to face, £50,000 from the frantic father, be allowed to leave the country on a prearranged flight, and with no exception to have the police involved. When he’s safely away, he’ll give the location of where the boy is hidden. This must all occur before 10:00 a.m. on the following day as that’s when the bomb is set to go off.\n\nThe exception is the first thing to fall through the cracks when the governess disobeys her employer’s instructions and she calls the kidnapping into Inspector Parnell (John Gregson). Parnell has a talent for breaking down his suspects into confessing and, against the father’s will, is almost able to break Marlowe just as Chester calls the interrogation off. Unfortunately, circumstances occur which makes it unlikely that they will find Jonathan before the 10:00 morning deadline.\n\nThere is a very interesting swinging 60s London scene when Inspector Parnell and his assistant Sergeant Grey [Kenneth Cope, best known from Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)] go to visit Marlowe’s parents in the hopes that they know where he lives. They don’t, nor do they seem concerned. But they run this underground club where the young, psychedelic youth go to freely “express” themselves with dance, music and drugs. His mother talks about how she bought her son the golliwogs that are seen in the windows when he was a boy and how much he loved them.\n\nDoes the boy get saved in the nick of time, and if so, by who? It was a very entertaining way to end the first day at Cinevent.\n\nDave Harnack writes in the Cinevent notes:\n\n…Shaw’s “Marlowe” earns the basic catch-all “psychopath” identification in the few written synopses available on this picture. Relegating Marlowe to “psychopath” status is true, though an over-simplification. He would be more accurately described as “exquisitely calculated.” Marlowe’s cold, dynamically expressionless gaze-enhanced by his matter-of-fact deliver—identifies more with a Western Union employee decoding a telegram. That “man-with-a-plan” determination is compounded by both his insensitivity as well as lack of sentimentality. Soon enough, the audience finds out that Shaw’s “Marlowe” is constructed with virtually no shame or remorse that can ultimately counteract his horrific plan. …\n\nStay tuned for Day 2.\n\nFriday, June 2, 2016\n\nI didn’t want to miss the 9:00 a.m. German film, THE TRIP TO TILSIT (1939). My friend, Adam, told me it was from the William K. Everson collection and with Bill gone these so many years, it was nostalgic to know that we were seeing this film because of him.\n\nThe story is about a rural couple who have a young son. Elske Settegast (Kristina Soderbaum) is a hardworking housewife with very little in the way of luxuries. She cleans, cooks and takes care of her child, trying to keep herself as well-groomed as can be expected when you live in a mud-infested property. Elske’s handsome fisherman husband, Endrik (Philip Dorn aka Fritz von Dongen) isn’t always home nights, and she knows it’s not only taking his catch to different city markets that is keeping him away. He is continuing an affair he started with Madlyn Sapierska (Anna Dammann) when she was the couples’ guest, staying in their home several months prior to the point where the story starts. Madlyn wants Endrik for herself and has no qualms confronting Elske, insisting she give him up.\n\nElske isn’t made of super strong resolve, but she decides she will only divorce Endrik if he absolutely insists this is what he wants. She of course prefers he end his affair with Madlyn but Endrik at first just can’t make up his mind. At times he promises he will but as soon as Madlyn appears, his will is hers. When it gets to a point that neither of them can stand the strain in their marriage, their biggest bone of contention becomes who will get custody of their young son Jons (Joachim Pfaff). Neither are prepared to give him up.\n\nMadlyn has a way about her that has a rather psychotic feel to it. But along with that, she also brings excitement and sophistication with her, something a virile man such as Endrik can’t ignore. Life in the backwaters is anything but glamorous. Madlyn goes so far as to whisper to Endrik that if Elske won’t give him up on her own accord, killing her might be his only option. And she promises she’ll love Jon as if he were her own. Hysterical but chilling words.\n\nSo with this thought floating in Endrik’s brain, he takes Elske and their horse (a gift from Elske’s father on their wedding day) to the big city to sell it and supposedly buy a gift for Jon’s birthday. As the two of them and their horse travelled on the small boat across the lake, I suddenly realized I was watching the German remake of Murnau’s 1927 Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans! I don’t usually read the notes in advance so enjoyed the eureka moment. And now, as it’s been years since I’ve seen Sunrise, I hope to watch it again in the not too distant future. So, if you have seen the film too, then you have some idea of how THE TRIP TO TILSIT works out.\n\nMy friend also mentioned to me during the screening that Swedish actress Kristina Soderbaum was married to the director, his third wife, at the time of the making of this film and up until his death. They were both pro-Nazi sympathizers, involved in making ten anti-Semitic propaganda films for Joseph Goebbels, the most famous being Jud Süß in 1940. After WWII, Harlan was charged with crimes against humanity, participating in the anti-Semitic movement and aiding the Nazis but successfully defended himself arguing that the Nazis controlled his work and he shouldn’t be held personally responsible for the content. Afterwards, in 1949, he was charged for his role as director of Jud Süß. He was acquitted by the Hamburg Criminal Chamber of the Regional Court but the court of the British occupation zone nullified this acquittal.\n\nInterestingly, his first wife was the Jewish actress and cabaret singer Dora Gerson but they divorced in 1924. She later died as a prisoner in Auschwitz. Another interesting note is that Harlan’s niece, Christiane Susanne Harlan was married to Jewish filmmaker Stanley Kubrick from 1958 until his death in 1999.\n\nHere is what Samantha Glasser wrote about the film in the Cinevent notes:\n\nTHE TRIP TO TILSIT (DIE REISE NACH TILSIT) is the 1939 German talkie version of Hermann Sudermann’s story of the sane name, also the story that inspired the silent Oscar winner for Best Unique and Artistic Picture Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. Where the silent film is stylish and experimental, the talkie relies on stark realism to tell its story. The grim, dirty sets show audiences the squalor that these characters live in and why they desire to break away from their routines and move onto something better and more glamorous….\n\n…There are some nice artistic choices in the film. In the New Year’s Eve scene, the close-up of the still-lit flame on the Christmas tree suggests that the flame has not gone out between the lovers. The climax is exciting with lots of quick cuts and director Veit Harlan employs camera techniques like split screens and dissolves to illustrate the story….\n\n…(Soderbaum)’s character(s) commonly drowned in these (propaganda) films, earning her the nickname Reichswasserleiche, or the Reich’s Water Corpse.\n\nHarlan is best known today for his association with the Nazi party and his film Jud Suss, an exaggerated tale about the ruthlessness of Jews. The stigma attached to Harlan’s name has caused many of his films to be difficult to find among both English-speaking collectors and Germans. Many members of his own family were unable to view Jud Suss in his lifetime. THE TRIP TO TILSIT seems to be more obscure because it was made prior to that film….\n\nThe next film that morning was the film I mentioned on Day 1 starring Alice Faye, EVERY NIGHT AT EIGHT (1935), directed by Raoul Walsh featuring a dashing George Raft.\n\nIt’s the story of three working girls, Dixie (Alice Faye), Susan (Frances Langord) and Daphne (Patsy Kelly), whose collective dream is to make it as radio singing stars. After a very humorous kerfuffle with a Dictaphone and their boss, Mr. Huxley (John Dilson), they are fired. While starving, they enter a talent contest but don’t win due to Susan’s fainting in the middle of their song. But here’s where they meet up with ‘Tops’ Cardona (George Raft) the conductor of the coolest band in town. The three girls team up with Tops and the whole shebang become a success, with the three singers becoming famous under the moniker of The Three Swanee Sisters—from down South. At every mention of their stage name, Al Jolson sprang to mind.\n\nBut success turns out to not be everything. Where’s the glamor? The luxuries? The men?! These gals are too busy to enjoy any of these things, it seems. Susan and Tops have an unrequited hankering for each other but that doesn’t go anywhere until the very end.\n\nOne of the scenes I found slightly outrageous but enjoyable was the girls’ reconciliation with their old boss, Huxley. Not as grouchy, nor as honorable, as a post-Code boss should be, it made you think how much more his employees would have liked him if he had shown a slightly softer nature around the office. But fame never fails to impress—and Huxley is no different than the girls’ other fans.\n\nIf there’s any lesson at all to be learned at the end of this fun and light film, perhaps it’s just that hard work pays off and enjoyment and relaxation come after retirement—let’s just hope we’re not too old to enjoy it. As Daphne declares during one of the scenes, “We’ll make our minds up and then think it over.”\n\nAt this time, Alice Faye was still single, but she marries Phil Harris, the star of MELODY CRUISE (1933) in 1941.\n\nPatsy Kelly is someone I’ve always enjoyed watching. Rather butch, she rarely differs in her screen persona, but is always humorous. As an example and as you can imagine, I enjoyed her advice as “The Babysitter” in Babies, They’re Wonderful (1947) an entertaining short which highlighted her tongue-in-cheek comedic talent. Her most popular on-screen partner was Thelma Todd until the latter’s suicide in 1935 at the age of 29. In the mid-1940s, after leaving film, Patsy became the personal assistant and lover of Tallulah Bankhead, remaining life-long friends when both those positions ended. Television revived her career, running from the early 50s until the late 70s. She died at the age of 71 in 1981.\n\nHere’s what Samantha Glasser had to say about the film in the Cinevent notes:\n\nA backstage musical, and not anticipated that three of its original songs would become immortal: “I Feel a Song Coming On,” “Take It Easy,” and “I’m in the Mood for Love.”…\n\n…Fans of old time radio will appreciate both the cast and the familiar banter between acts. The film gives a glimpse of what it was like behind the scenes at a radio station and of the variety of acts available to audiences in a time when vaudeville was on the decline. We get top notch musical numbers in addition to novelty acts including one woman who sings like a chicken.\n\nA very, very funny performance by Florence Gill!!!\n\nTo view this film online, click here.\n\nOkay. The next film was the film I was waiting to see. THIS DAY AND AGE (1933), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. I had recently finished reading Scott Eyman’s “Empire of Dreams”, a very well-written biography about the director. I had already been intrigued when first reading about the film in Thomas Doherty’s “Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema 1930-1934.” It sounded kind of odd; off-balanced. As so many of DeMille’s films are.\n\nJust to annoy myself, I had a hard time keeping conscious during the screening but for the most part, I was able to follow the story line, which I actually knew a fair amount about. It featured a tough and rough, sometimes sexy Charles Bickford as the ruthless gangster Louis Garrett.\n\nIt’s the story of students who rise up against the local hoods who have bombed a shop and killed likeable tailor Herman (Harry Green) while one of their school chums buying some clothes at the time, survives (or also maybe dies—I can’t quite remember). Through usual political corruption, Garrett gets off to continue running his nightclub while committing murder wherever it seems fit.\n\nGay Merrick (Judith Allen) who’s in love with boy hero Steve Smith (Richard Cromwell) infiltrates Garrett’s world with another male student connected with the gangster and wanting to win Gay over. Garrett notices Gay and makes note at one point in the film that he “likes my olives green.” Later on, when she goes after him with a dubious motive, he finishes the quote with “…but I don’t like to pick them.” Dialogue is everything.\n\nWhy the film is so odd is because it ends with teenagers (maybe Mao Tse-tung got his revolutionary idea from THIS DAY AND AGE?), not the law, deciding who is right or wrong, who lives and, but not quite, who dies. What was equally bizarre is the boys were all given honorary city positions, apparently as some sort of advanced civics course. Really quite a strange philosophy for an American film, but not, I suppose, for a pre-Code made in the same year as Gabriel Over the White House. Although it didn’t affect DeMille on a personal level—he was quite well-off—being deep into the Depression, people felt they had no power and the government wasn’t going fast enough at doing anything about their predicament. Socialism seemed like it could be an answer. But DeMille had some rather strange and conflicting ideas about democracy vs communism. The former was what he believed in—except not necessarily when it pertained to himself in a leadership role.\n\nAuthor Scott Eyman was present at Cinevent and although I had the opportunity to meet him briefly while buying another one of his books (on Lubitsch if you must know), what he had to say about the film is found in “Empire of Dreams”. I quote what he wrote here, but if you are interested in the dichotomy of what is DeMille, then you won’t be disappointed in obtaining a copy of the book for yourself:\n\nIn 1933, Grace Bradley went in to interview with DeMille for a part. She had been warned not to put on any nail polish—DeMille didn’t like it. “The part was, he said, a virgin, and only a virgin could play a virgin. I walked in and sat down and he looked at me and said, ‘No, I can’t see you in the part. You don’t look like a virgin.’ Now, my mother was outside waiting for me! ‘I see you on a long couch,’ he said, ‘with leopard skin, and two nubian slaves with feather fans on both sides of you.’ I just sat there with my mouth open.”\n\nFor the film called THIS DAY AND AGE, DeMille cast Frank Coghlan, his juvenile at the DeMille studios, now a teenager, for one of the supporting parts. DeMille must have had a soft spot for Coghlan—one day on location, the young actor was late. He just walked in and took his place, which would usually earn a burst of excoriation about courtesy and professionalism. Instead, DeMille said nothing.\n\nThe child star Diana Serra, the former Baby Peggy, witnessed DeMille at his worst, after he had been nursing a grudge against leading lady Judith Allen. “Judith Allen [real name Mari Coleman] was promoted as this pristine little ingénue,” remember Serra, “but it came out that she was married to wrestler [named Gus Sonnenberg]. Then they tried making her a socialite who had married down, but it didn’t take. She had kept her marriage quiet and DeMille felt deceived. Then she got a divorce, and he got really angry.\n\n“When it came time for her to do this scene, she was green, and she had trouble, and he laced into her. The F-word was just for openers, and those words were not in common usage at that time.\n\n“I’m sure that he thought he would make her cry, and he did, but it became a deluge; she got hysterical. Richard Cromwell, who was only about twenty-three, was gay—I think most people on the set knew—and he was the only man on that set who had the guts to say, ‘Mr. DeMille, if you don’t let up on this girl, I’ll deck you.’ And DeMille looked at him and saw real was real and he quit. And Cromwell picked her up—she was completely hysterical—and took her home.” (Richard Cromwell later became Angela Lansbury’s first husband. After his acting career petered out, he became a successful artist, selling exquisite ceramic screens weighing four and five hundred pounds to many in Hollywood.)\n\n“The thing about DeMille,” continued Serra, “yes, he was a good father and a good director, but he was also a tyrant. He was of that era—a mogul with his own unit, and nobody ever told him ‘No!’; nobody ever called him on the carpet.”\n\nTHIS DAY AND AGE belongs firmly to the Social Breakdown genre of the early days of the Depression, along with William Wellman’s Wild Boys of the Road and so forth. And on the surface, it’s also part of an exceedingly disturbing crypto-fascist grouping that includes Gabriel over the White House and The President Vanishes.\n\nThe films of the left—King Vidor’s Our Daily Bread, Chaplin’s Modern Times—proposed that the social chaos could be ameliorated through everybody pulling together for a common goal of survival. The films of the right proposed that everybody pull together for the common goal of ignoring the law, although DeMille is careful to characterize the power structure as not just absent, but apathetic and corrupt. As one character says, the law can’t beat “a million dollar a year mouthpiece.” In the absence of law and order, the idealistic young take charge.\n\nThe story of THIS DAY AND AGE is simple: a group of teenagers are appalled when a gangster who has murdered a friend of theirs eludes a murder charge through the machinations of his lawyer. They kidnap him, torture him, and come close to lynching him until he confesses and is led away by the newly awaked police.\n\nThe film begins with a snappy, frenetic montage of modern life—cities, dirigibles, surging crowds. Throughout, DeMille directs in a much more current style than in his costume pictures; he directs for speed, with a nervous editing rhythm. (In many respects, the film is a counterpart to The Godless Girl, although not as successful.)\n\nDeMille burdens himself with actors who are either colorless (Richard Cromwell, Judith Allen) or bizarre (Fuzzy Knight and Billy Gilbert play gangsters). But DeMille also moves beyond the clichés he’s handling. The Jewish tailor who is murdered, thus generating the plot, begins as a stereotype out of Abie’s Irish Rose, but as he clings to his independence he becomes individual and admirable.\n\nThe critic and screenwriter Andrew Bergman called the film a bizarre amalgam of Joseph Goebbels and Corliss Archer, although the film provides an example of fairly advanced racial politics. One of the high school students is a young black man named George (Onest Conley), who is enlisted in a plot to kidnap the gangster. “Do you shine shoes?” one of the kids asks him.\n\n“I shine my own,” he replies.\n\nDuring the kidnapping, the black student plays the part of a shambling Stepin Fetchit. When the gangster is bound and stuffed into the car, a passerby asks “What was that?”\n\n“That’s a high school fraternity initiation! Yes, ma’am,” the character says, as he tosses the dialect aside.\n\nTHIS DAY AND AGE captures DeMille at a moment when he, like most of America, was enraged by a void in authority that had led to the stock market crash and a worldwide depression. “We haven’t got time for any rules of evidence,” yells the leader of the teenage vigilantes. DeMille understood authority as only an autocrat can, and he was voicing dangerously Democratic sympathies—“I am not a radical, but now things are a question of right and wrong,” he said. “The public has been milked and are growing tired of it. It is not [financial] speculation alone. There is something rotten at the core of our system.”\n\nThe climax is an uncomfortable sequence where the gangster (Charles Bickford) is trussed up and lowered into a pit full of rats. It’s a fairly obvious variation on the climax of Fritz Lang’s M, and was pointed out as such by several critics. When the police arrive, they decide to support the kids, and a local judge is woken up and convenes a new trial that will certainly find the gangster guilty. Shot in a little more than four weeks for a cost of $279,811, THIS DAY AND AGE was released in August 1933, and grossed $668,375, eking out a profit of $21,712.\n\nThe last full-featured film before the dinner break was D.W. Griffith’s ISN’T LIFE WONDERFUL (1924). Although I own a (not so good) copy of this on DVD, I was more than happy to view it for my first time on film with live musical accompaniment.\n\nIt’s the story of a family of Polish refugees who immigrate to Germany just after WWI comes to an end. They are very poor, and life is hard. The patriarch, a professor (Erville Alderson), takes what work he can marking papers for a local school. Inga (Carol Dempster), an orphan taken in by the family when she was a child, is totally devoted to the family. As well, she is in love with one of the sons, Paul (Neil Hamilton) who she grew up with alongside his brother Theodor (Frank Puglia). The feeling is reciprocal.\n\nAnother newly “adopted” family member is Rudolph played by Lupino Lane. It was especially interesting to get a chance to see Lane in a serious film, even if his role still falls somewhat into the category of comic relief, because he is one of the famous Lupinos, second cousin to Ida.\n\nThe story contains aspects of sacrifice, love, villainy, hard work, illness, moderate success, with the high point being that the possibility of losing the person you love most in the world would be the worst catastrophe of all.\n\nI thought that Carol Dempster was very well cast as the always frail and starved-looking heroine. She kind of looked like an emaciated Tina Fey. Neil Hamilton, especially in the silent era, is always easy on the eyes.\n\nHere’s what Michael Schlesinger had to say about the film in the Cinevent notes:\n\nIn 1924, Griffith was having a rough time. He’d directed three consecutive and costly flops, most recently America, and abandoned a fourth. He needed a hit desperately to hold up his end of United Artists. And he hand’t helped his situation by dumping Lillian Gish and replacing her with his “protégé” (wink, wink) Carol Dempster, who acting-wise wasn’t even in Mae Marsh’s league, let alone Gish’s. He felt that an uplifting romance set in contemporary Europe, which was still emerging from the rubble of The Great War, would do the trick.\n\nIt did not. ISN’T LIFE WONDERFUL, an ironic title under the circumstances, ended his relationship with the company he co-founded (and forced him to sell his studio in Mamaroneck). He moved over to Paramount—taking Dempster with him—where he fared little better. And the rest you know. But with nearly a century between then and now, the film looks much better, and falls neatly into Griffith’s Victorian-era universe of teary yet optimistic romance crossed with socio-political angst. To emphasize the latter, Griffith actually went to Germany and Austria to shoot the exteriors, thus taking advantage of the beautiful rural locations. The story begins, typically, with an orphan—in this case, Dempster (who in fairness gives a much better performance than in her previous films) who’s been living with a Polish family and has fallen in love with one of the sons (Hamilton, looking impossibly young) who’s off at the battlefront. He survives, but gas attacks—and not the knockwurst kind—have weakened him. The family moves to Berlin, but remains living in poverty. Despite his health, Hamilton gets a job at a shipyard, while brother Puglia works as a waiter. But the already notorious German inflation makes it nearly impossible to survive; there’s the justly-dismaying scene where Dempster stands in a long line to buy meat, only to watch in horror as the price keeps escalating.\n\nAnother jaw-dropper is a nightclub where the performers have to wear paper costumes. (Knowing the horrors to come make scenes like these even more intense today.) Yet her devotion to him, and his family, speaks to the deep well of courage each of us has deep inside if we’re willing to dig for it. (But it’s not entirely doom-and-gloom; Lane and Alderson provide some necessary light relief, and there is a happy ending, though one that feels suspiciously tacked-on.)\n\nAlas, the intertitles are as florid as ever, from the weird opening cards to try to justify the decision to shoot on location, as if any were needed, to such dialogue as “Yes, beasts we are! Beasts they have made us! Years of war and hell—beasts they have made us!” (This at least provided useful training for Hamilton, who had to deliver even more purple dialogue over 40 years later as Commissioner Gordon.) Yet despite its B.O. belly-flop, the reviews were extremely good….(And the following year, Charley Chase gave it a hat tip by making Isn’t Life Terrible?) Today, in an era where Griffith’s name has been besmirched by ignoramuses who think Birth of a Nation is the only film he ever made—or that it’s representative of all of them—it’s always important to remember that that was the exception, not the rule, especially when less-often-seen films like this one are given the opportunity to be enjoyed once more, or for the first time, as a reminder that his humanity was as great as his talent.\n\nAll this does is leave me looking forward to finding the time to read Richard Schickel’s biography “D.W. Griffith: An American Life” and learn more.\n\nAs per usual, I skipped a presentation and the Charley Chase Shorts. I really shouldn’t skip the Charley Chase Shorts because I actually quite like the bitter, ironic Charley. He can be very funny and nasty. But I didn’t want to miss the two films later that evening, the latter not starting till close to 11:00 p.m.\n\nThe first film up was SLIGHTLY SCARLET (1956) in beautiful Technicolor, directed by my compatriot, Toronto-born Allan Dwan. Based on a book by James M. Cain, it’s a noirish film about two sisters, June Lyons (Rhonda Fleming), the gorgeous kind of good sister and Dorothy (Arlene Dahl) the equally gorgeous but bats**t crazy, sexually-warped bad sister. And for a moment earlier on, I thought she was the nice one. I had made up a scenario in my head based on what had so far occurred that made me think—it’s really June who’s the bad one and has set up poor Dorothy to take the fall which sent her to jail. The film begins where June picks up Dorothy from outside a jail, brings her to live with her in her plush home equipped with maid Martha [Ellen Corby] all along telling Dorothy she didn’t have the funds to get her out of the can any earlier; June is stringing her nice-guy boyfriend/politician-boss Frank Jansen (Kent Taylor) along—he’s madly in love with her; and she falls easily into making out with—whether good guy or bad; she and we don’t know yet—Ben Grace (John Payne).\n\nSo one night while in her twin bed in the bedroom she shares with June, Dorothy confesses she could fall for Ben. Another thing her sister has taken from her, I thought, a chance of happiness with nice guy Grace. Doesn’t she already have rich, handsome boss Jansen swooning over her? And what’s up with this sharing of a bedroom?! There wasn’t another extra bedroom in this rather sprawling house so that each woman couldn’t sleep in a room of her own?! What was the psychology behind that—or dare I ask? Both Rhonda Fleming and Arlene Dahl were gorgeous. Put them together in one bedroom, and I can only imagine—but won’t go there—as to what thoughts prevailed in the minds of most of the males in the audience. Not to mention what thoughts popped up with regard to one particular negligee that Rhonda tossed and turned in.\n\nOnce I made this confession out loud to my companion—the one about thinking Dorothy was the nice sister, not the negligee thought—it became almost immediately apparent in the next scene that I didn’t know what I was thinking. Dorothy was creepily crazy.\n\nPerhaps that’s what makes the film extra delicious, this inability to immediately peg people. As I mentioned above, Ben Grace’s motives are hard to pin-point, but become clearer as the story progresses. There’s an unintentionally amusing visual when the 6’ 2½” Ben meets with the 5’ 7½” Detective Lt. Dave Dietz (Frank Gerstle). There is a desk between them and it appears as if Payne is standing on a platform overlooking Gerstle behind his desk.\n\nIn the last year or so, I’ve inadvertently seen a number of John Payne films, Star Dust, Footlight Serenade, 99 River Street, The Boss, with the two former from the 40s and the two latter, the 50s. Besides the fact that Payne was also a singer playing in many musicals in his earlier films, I also noticed a big physical change in him between these two decades. At first I wondered if it was due to a serious facial accident he had when hit by a car, but the accident occurred in 1961, so I suppose it was just the aging process and how it personally affected him as an individual.\n\nBut back to the film at hand. There’s the gangster theme, with top-notch thug-isms led by Ted de Corsia as Solly Caspar, including an uncredited appearance by George E. Stone as Roos. A line that stuck out for me was, I believe one of Ben’s just before he pulls the trigger: “I don’t like killing people; never did.” Sort of relatable, I say.\n\nSuggested by one of my film friends just after the screening was that he thought that Arlene Dahl’s performance should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Her performance was quite squirm-worthy, to say the least!\n\nHere’s some of what Richard M. Roberts had to say about the film in the Cinevent notes:\n\n“Love’s Lovely Counterfeit” was never one of James M. Cain’s more popular novels—start with a tongue-tripping title and bad timing in its publication in 1942, making its depiction of corrupt politics in a major US city something wartime America didn’t really want to consider, no matter how true. The critics also seemed to think it a lesser work in comparison to Cain’s previous books like “The Postman Always Rings Twice” and “Mildred Pierce”, which, along with Cain’s next published novel, “Double Indemnity”, would cement his immortality cinema-wise in the mid-forties as big-hit movies came out yearly. Despite all the studios chomping for Cain novels, no one bit on “Counterfeit”, and no film of it would surface until fourteen years after its publication.\n\nThis is indeed somewhat odd, as it seemed a film noir natural, with an anti-hero lead that would fit casting of any of the crime drama’s favorite sons… Perhaps the main plot was a little too close to Dashiell Hammett’s “The Glass Key”, already made into two film versions by Paramount, and the secondary plot-thread involving the protagonist’s involvement with a gorgeous female political insider and her equally gorgeous but criminally psychotic sister, was perhaps a bit too rocky to maneuver through production code-wise.\n\nSo fast-forward to fourteen years later, with the whole late-labelled “Film Noir” cycle nearing its end, John Garfield already dead, Bogie heading for the boneyard and Jimmy Cagney a bit too old for it, but enough teeth removed from the Breen Office to have a little more fun with “Counterfeit’s” mangy mix of love, lust, potential incest and political chicanery, and we have not only the first noir film version of Cain’s more obscure hard-boiled tome, but also the rarity of rarities——–a Technicolor as well!\n\nReally, can there be such a thing as Technicolor black? Wasn’t film noir, even for a made-up-after-the-fact pretentious French critic term (remember, no one in Hollywood making these films at the time ever called them noir, they were crime dramas) the land of monochrome, blacks and whites full of shadow, smoke, and very few shades of grey? Well, what the hell, why not. Especially when you’re making a noir featuring two sisters with heads aflame, heads the color of blood……..\n\nThe film’s re-title then begins to make sense. SLIGHTLY SCARLET sells it, it rolls over the tongue with more rough familiarity than Cain’s original, and suddenly that sexy secondary plot seems to be pushing itself forefront, easy to do when the two sexy sisters are played by Rhonda Fleming (good) and Arlene Dahl (bad), two babes Technicolor seems to have been invented for.\n\nSLIGHTLY SCARLET was the brainchild of curious independent producer Benedict Bogeaus, who came to the business in the early 1940’s, after a career in real estate, radio manufacturing, and zipper making. Bogeaus managed to acquire the busy General Service Studio in Hollywood from ERPI, its previous owners, in 1942, outbidding soon-to-be-competing independent producer Edward Small for the facilities….\n\n…Bogeaus hired a capable and reliable director make the(se) films. Allan Dwan was then on his fifth decade in the business…\n\n…By the time he (John Payne) made SLIGHTLY SCARLET, he was more known for playing tough-guys than warbling a melody. As Ben Grace, caught in an ever-deepening hole of political and criminal double-dealing while also double-dealing with the two hot sisters, Payne gives a rather good performance that makes him both tough and shrewd, yet frequently bewildered at his own predicament….\n\n…Some film noir “experts” argue as to whether SLIGHTLY SCARLET is truly “noir” (hmmmmm, experts of a genre that really didn’t exist in Hollywood to begin with passing judgment on whether or not a film can or can’t be considered a part of same non-existent genre? And they make fun of trekkies who speak Klingon). Ah well, most of them are into it just so they can wear the hats anyway. Whatever the heck it is, SLIGHTLY SCARLET is a solid, strange, wild and wacky movie shot in a crackpot canvas of solid colors and chiaroscuro, which will look even more eye-popping in the original IB Technicolor print Cinevent is going to show you. Though no expert will ever call it a screamin’ bonafide classic, maybe it is indeed unclassifiable because it is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nThe last film of the night was WHITE TIGER (1923), directed by Tod Browning. I didn’t want to miss this and for the most part, didn’t. The story begins when a father of two young children, in criminal partnership with a man named Hawkes (Wallace Beery) is betrayed and killed. The boy is left to fend for himself while the little girl is taken away and brought up by Hawkes. Young Roy (Raymond Griffith) swears to avenge his father and what he believes is the death of his sister, Sylvia (Priscilla Dean). The siblings, unbeknownst to each other, grow up and continue in the same line of work as their father before them.\n\nOne evening, the two meet up and are immediately attracted. This could be very interesting, I thought. However, we are told just as immediately in no uncertain terms that they are attracted by their minds and personalities only, not romantically. I guess some subjects were just too taboo. And to make sure that nothing untoward forms between the brother and sister, Sylvia is pursued by the upstanding Dick Longworth (Matt Moore) and eventually succumbs to his charms.\n\nRoy operates a mechanical chess-player which enables him to steal jewelry and other valuables from his mark. Sylvia, a pickpocket in her own right, works with Hawkes, now calling himself Count Donelli. He as well has no recognition of the now-grown Roy when insisting they go into partnership together. For some reason, Roy, at this stage in the game, doesn’t recognize Hawkes either.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects to the film was learning how the mechanics of the chessman worked. Certainly in this day and age with all the technology and magic we are subject to, the mechanical chessman looks simple. But it was still a good con and fun for us, especially during a “Teller and Penn” show and tell reveal. Since “white tigers” symbolize cosmic forces in the world, and Browning used carnival themes in many of his films due to his personal background, I’m surmising that this is the reasoning behind the title.\n\nHere’s what Eric Grayson had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\n…Director Tod Browning has an odd habit of annoying people even after his 1962 death. Often called a “hack,” because his films are repetitive, sometimes called an “auteur” for the same reason, Browning’s films are frustrating and still engaging. WHITE TIGER was not his last film for Universal. That honor falls to Drifting (1923), which was actually released before this film. The studio brass decided that they didn’t like WHITE TIGER, so it sat on a shelf for most of a year before it was recut and released.\n\nThis may have been the first time that the studio interfered with one of Browning’s pictures, but it would not be the last. Browning was beset with contradictory instructions: the studio wanted him to make a successful crime drama like Outside the Law, with almost all the elements the same, but they wanted something fresh and different, too. Priscilla Dean, who starred in nine films for Browning, was particularly adept at turning from a sweet-looking innocent to a hardened criminal in the blink of an eye. This ability, like Lon Chaney’s uncanny knack for looking like someone shot his best friend, got them both stuck in an acting rut.\n\nAs a result, WHITE TIGER is almost too much like Outside the Law, including the “locked-in-a-closet” climax that William K. Everson used to complain about. Browning’s crime drama films became such a staple of 1920s cinema that they are very cleverly spoofed in Paths to Paradise (1924), which is basically a send-up of WHITE TIGER… even down to having Raymond Griffith in the lead.\n\nBrowning had a couple of problems at this time. He was not only hindered by Universal’s front office (a common complaint), but he was drinking heavily. Scholars for years have doubted Browning’s claim that he was an active alcoholic between 1921 and 1925, given his constant filmic output, but Skal and Savada’s excellent book “Dark Carnival” shows that he really was having problems. Those few films that are available from this period show that the pep and flair that had been in evidence in his earlier films has been replaced with a flat businesslike approach to getting the film cranked out as quickly as possible.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Browning was sometimes given his wishes by a studio front office, and could turn in an interesting film as a result (Outside the Law, Virgin of Stamboul.) He was also willing to bend to studio pressure, and would gladly turn out a derivative product (WHITE TIGER, Where East is East). Occasionally, he would do something off the deep end (Freaks, The Unknown, The Show) which would annoy nearly everyone, requiring him to follow it up with a conventional money-maker movie.\n\nThat said, Browning’s movies at Universal are generally more interesting than his films at MGM (with a few notable exceptions.) Universal let him experiment a bit. The surviving footage of The Exquisite Thief is quite good, even inventive; Virgin of Stamboul is a departure for both Dean and Browning. Under Two Flags (1922) is said to be rather good as well, with Dean playing Cigarette, the part played by Claudette Colbert in the 1936 remake.\n\nBrowning’s early films are rather difficult to see because of Universal’s policy of pitching nitrate, but a few 16mm prints were scattered to the winds in the 1930s when families could order Show-At-Home prints of any title in the vaults. This Show-At-Home print of WHITE TIGER used to belong to William K. Everson, who got a bit tired of it and decided to sell it in the early 1990s. It’s a little choppy at the beginning and there’s a minute or so of missing footage in the second reel, but all known prints seem to derive from this one.\n\nSo, in summation, if you love Tod Browning, then you’ll like WHITE TIGER. If you hate Tod Browning, well, you probably didn’t even make it this far into the notes.\n\nStay tuned for Day 3.\n\nSaturday, June 4, 2016 – Day 3\n\nSince sleeping is one of things you want to do in your room and not in the theatre, I slept late and missed the Annual Animation Program. As well, the first film of the day was HOUDINI (1953) and although it’s a beautiful colour print with two beautiful people cast in the lead roles, I chose to miss this one as well. I had watched it recently at home and there was a lot more to see in the day ahead. Unfortunately, though, this was my most difficult day for fatigue.\n\nIn HOUDINI, the few things that stood out for me is the fact that there was a lot of chemistry between real-life married couple Tony Curtis who played Harry and his then wife Janet Leigh who played Bess Houdini. And I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone with as small a waist as Janet Leigh. When I was watching it with my son, we were both quite astounded by this. It felt that you could encircle both thumb and index finger around her waist and your fingers would touch.\n\nHarry Houdini is always an interesting draw for most people, certainly myself. He made five films, directing as well the last one he starred in, in 1923. I’ve had the opportunity to see him in The Man from Beyond (1922), where he plays Howard Hillary, frozen in Arctic ice for the past 100 years, and is found, thawed, and returned to civilization only to believe he has discovered his lost love alive and kicking.\n\nOkay, this has nothing to do with the film HOUDINI. I also believe some of the story-line in the 1953 film has not much to do with the real life of Houdini, but we know that’s how bio-films are usually made.\n\nHere’s what Dave Harnack had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\nCinevent’s movie magic weekend doesn’t miss a trick with HOUDINI, Paramount’s glorious period drama with fine production values—a modest $1.4 million budget showcased to maximum effectiveness by producer George Pal—along with George Marshall’s crisp direction and Philip Yordan’s mobile script. Pal apparently incorporated a similar philosophy with HOUDINI as he did the same calendar year with War of the Worlds. In WOTW, Pal employed director Byron Haskin to approach it as more of an action film than simply a cerebral exercise; this is also true of HOUDINI.\n\nBoth Marshall and prolific writer Yordan certainly move the picture at more than just an ample pace. Each chapter along the celluloid continuum is carefully compartmentalized to maintain each sequence’s importance in motivating Houdini’s historic (and ultimately tragic) steps. Individual acts are treated uniquely, yet the flow and sweep is natural and never feels too segmented or interrupted (aided greatly by George Tomasini’s editing), delivering a well-paced drama with satisfying dosses of wit and charm. At the day of CinemaScope and other widescreen process, one wonders if HOUDINI (shot in fall of 1952) had been made a year later if the studio would have employed one of them.\n\nAlso anchoring Houdini is rising star Tony Curtis, initiating a 12-year runto eventual supernova status…. Curtis’ flawless profile and well-sculpted physique—accented by his twinkling eye charm—consumed audiences from the start. Surprisingly, his early bit roles were mostly heavies, though later his GQ looks never fully betrayed the subsequent character range afforded to him. Curtis was able to effectively portray less-than-amiable characters such as the hateful John Jackson in The Defiant Ones, and the unscrupulous press agent Sydney Falco in The Sweet Smell of Success….\n\nCurtis was blessed with a mesmerizing screen idol face, projecting almost a Greek god-like quality at times (especially accentuated by skilled cinematographers). Athletic, charming and conveying a natural screen presence, he is in command from the first frame; and his zeal for the real life character only helps to add another layer of authenticity. His quiet intensity is perfectly suited for one of the film’s best sequences, involving a straight-jacket escape competition at a formal dinner. Also authentic is Curtis’ showmanship and ability as a noted amateur magician, further enhancing our belief in him as Houdini.\n\nCurtis’ real-life spouse Janet Leigh lays movie-wife Bess Houdini; the two would be a couple again in The Black Shield of Falworth and Who Was That Lady? Other than a few late 1940s leads, Leigh’s own career virtually paralleled Curtis’ screen stardom stretch from the early 1950s through the mid-1960s. Leigh consistently dignified her roles and could “commandeer” the delicate female support role and infuse a spirited head-strong persona. Leigh does this effortlessly in our film… Her more than just the “dutiful wife” in Houdini projects an authentic dichotomy of both support and challenge to Curtis throughout the picture, most notably during two particularly harrowing—and potentially marriage terminating—sequences.\n\nMore than just an “Honorable Mention” emphatically goes to seven-time Oscar nominee and winner Ernest Laszlo… His incredible shining Technicolor cinematography glistens from the opening carnival sequence of balloons and facades to the fabulous interiors of the European sets. (The gowns of Leigh and Angela Clarke, as Houdini’s mother, along with the soldier’s uniforms at the formal dinner, are pure eye candy.)…\n\nIn a private conversation held with Ms. Leigh back in July of 2000, I had the privilege of spending some quality time with her regarding Prince Valiant and HOUDINI. She commented not just on how much she enjoyed working on both films (including Tony Curtis and Robert Wagner), BUT how much time was dedicated to just getting ready for most of her scenes due to the “costume” element. It was “My gosh, all of that time spent with lighting and readying me to look right for those beautiful gowns…and the attention to my face and hair too! And all for just a very few minutes on film!”\n\nThe first afternoon film was HIS PICTURE IN THE PAPERS (1916), directed by John Emerson, with Douglas Fairbanks. Along with Emerson, the story was written with friend, lover and eventual wife, Anita Loos. The title of the film conveys the gist of the story, with Pete Prindle (Fairbanks) going from scheme to scheme to get his picture in the paper to win the hand of his love, Christine Cadwalader (Loretta Blake) before the ending. While doing so, he gets himself in many finger-biting but humorous predicaments, all done with Fairbank’s athletic finesse.\n\nIt’s certainly an early send up of health foods and their lack(!) of benefits..unless you hide more enjoyable ingredients, such as alcohol in your father’s company’s packaging.\n\nJust after they both have dined at his father’s vegetarian restaurant, Pete and the daughter of his father’s best customer meet up at a local restaurant where they both can indulge on…meat.\n\nPete is also tastier in Christine’s eyes than the fiancé her father has forced upon her, Melville (Homer Hunt).\n\nBut when Pete comes a-courting, Cassius Cadwalader (Charles Butler) won’t agree to a union of the two lovebirds unless Pete can obtain a half-interest in his father’s company. Meanwhile, just so you know, there’s a blackmailing situation going on which Christine’s father is the victim of.\n\nBut Pete has always been lazy when it comes to working for his father’s company. When his father shows him that his two sisters have done more work than him just by getting their photo in the paper and promoting his goods, Pete is sure that he can easily do the same. And that’s when he comes up with Scheme Number 1: fake car accident. He has his professionally done portraits ready along with his spiel but all he finds in the paper the next day is a tiny, little two liner with no photo, lost in the middle of one of the inner pages.\n\nNow for Scheme Number 2: to fight Battling Burke in a boxing match. Pete gets there in the nick of time to fight, wins, but just as the photos are taken, the police raid the joint. Foiled again.\n\nScheme Number 3: being miraculously cured of a life-long illness. Totally unbelievable and not a positive way to promote health food products.\n\nScheme Number 4: consult a psychic. Pete never makes it there. After going drinking with his friend and used as a live cocktail shaker, they put the sleeping inebriate on-board a cruiser. To get back to the shore, he jumps ship and swims back. While pyjama clad and still clutching the umbrella Christine gave him at scheme 2, he fights with police officers resisting arrest, spends a night in jail, and still doesn’t get him what he wants—his picture in the paper!\n\nRemember the blackmailing scheme? Well, by happening to be at the wrong place at the right time, he is able to foil the dastardly deed and save over 200 lives.\n\nAnd that, happy viewers, brings on the happy ending. If you are a von Stroheim fan, watch out for him as one of the blackmailing Weazels.\n\nHere’s what Samantha Glasser had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\nDouglas Fairbanks is larger than life in HIS PICTURE IN THE PAPERS, his fourth film appearance. Audiences at the Knickerbocker Theatre premier on February 10, 1916 applauded him upon his first entrance in the film, indicating his quick rise in popularity. One critic wrote, “He is apparently in a class all by himself, at once an athlete of resource and daring, and a subtle interpreter of the amusing side of human nature.”\n\nWriters Anita Loos of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” fame and John Emerson craft a story about a man who can only appeal to his sweetheart if he inherits half of his father’s health food business. His father (Clarence Handyside) advises that in order to inherit, he must drum up publicity for the company. They poke fun at health food enthusiasts and nepotism along the way. Emerson and Fairbanks were already friends from the Broadway stage and worked together well in films. Loos and Fairbanks went on to work together on nine movies. Emerson also directs and utilizes lots of quick cuts to keep the action on pace with Fairbanks’ antics. His trademark athleticism is on full display as he leaps over beds, climbs buildings and boxes other fit men in an attempt to gain fortune.\n\nMuch of Fairbanks’ charm comes from his genuine personality. He loved to improvise on the script. In one scene, he stands in a rainstorm under the window of his girlfriend who was supposed to come down and bring him an umbrella. Instead, Fairbanks climbed the building to retrieve it, and the scene became unique and memorable. In another, he finds a junk auto wearing a sign that says, “Take me home for $83.99.” Absent from Loos’ personal script was the bit with Fairbanks taking the sign off the car and adorning himself with it. In a 1939 interview, Loos said Fairbanks was as much involved in the writing process as she and Emerson and that often Fairbanks’ ideas went over best with audiences.\n\nAccording to Tracy Goessel’s “The First King of Hollywood”, this film was shot at Triangle studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey in October and finished before wintertime. Exteriors were shot on Riverside Drive and in Atlantic City, and the boxing match was shot at the Sharkey Athletic Club in New York. Famous featherweight boxer Terry McGovern has a cameo as a referee. Look for future auteur Erich von Stroheim in a bit part as a tough guy.\n\nIt was just after the film was completed that Fairbanks and his wife Beth attended a party hosted by Elsie Janis in Tarrytown, NY where he met Mary Pickford….\n\nAnd the rest made history. To view this film online, click here.\n\nFollowing the film there was a shorts program, featuring the comedic druggy short, THE MYSTERY OF THE LEAPING FISH (1916). I have seen it on several occasions and caught the tail end where coked up Coke Ennyday (Fairbanks) saves The Little Fish Blower (Bessie Love) from impending doom.\n\nNext up was LAW BEYOND THE RANGE (1935), a western directed by Ford Beebe. Considering he was a prolific screenwriter and director, he was a stranger to me.\n\nI didn’t always enjoy westerns, but there are some I have come to tolerate and even enjoy and this was one. The basic story is about Ranger Tim McDonald (Tim McCoy) who loses his job when he defends friend Johnny Kane (Robert Allen) on a murder charge. When Tim sets up fighting crime as a newspaperman elsewhere, he also finds romance with Gloria Alexander (Billie Seward). I have a hard time remembering most of the film, but the one scene that stood out for me was the shootout. I don’t know if this shooting technique was used too often in films, but it was the incredible two-gun two-handed up-and-down motion that ended with our hero as the victor. Another unusual idea was the interesting choice of using the backside of old wallpaper rolls for printing material when the paper stock was lost when the office was bombed. Nothing could stop the presses or the news getting out!\n\nHere is just some of what Richard M. Roberts had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\nIt’s getting’ darn near time that Cinevent should start running the occasional “B” Western from the 1930s and 40s. This genre has, in the last few decades, become a forgotten and neglected one. The collectors and fans who grew up seeing them at Saturday morning matinees were indeed die-hard, and as time passed, they also unfortunately died off, leaving no new generation to find a way to fall in love with these films in the same fashion.\n\n…In the 1920s, Tim McCoy was a big enough star to make films for MGM, coming to the studio in 1926 and joining films with an impressive non-theatrical career already behind him. Timothy John Fitzgerald McCoy was born April 10, 1891 in that gar-out Wild West town of Saginaw, Michigan, the son of the Saginaw police chief. While attending S. Ignatius College in Chicago, McCoy went to a wild west show and was immediately entranced by it. Leaving school, McCoy roamed and settled in Wyoming. After finding work at a cattle ranch, Tim soon became an expert horseman and roper, and he became well versed in the languages and customs of the local Wyoming Indian tribes. He was working the rodeo circuit when America entered World War I, and Tim enlisted in the U.S. Army where he was commissioned and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Returning to Wyoming after the Armistice, McCoy was soon called by Governor Bob Carry to assume the post of Adjutant General of Wyoming’s National Guard, carrying the brevet promotion of Brigadier General, reportedly making McCoy the youngest general in the U.S. Army.\n\nThis commission called on McCoy’s Indian experience in his numerous dealings with the Wind River Reservation tribes, both Arapahoe and Shoshone, and in 1922, his reputation for diplomatic working with native-Americans brought him to the attention of Jesse Lasky, who asked him to be the liaison for and to provide several hundred Indian extras to work on paramount’s historical epic, The Covered Wagon. McCoy as so may other did, found the movie business exciting, and after completing his work on the James Cruze film, he resigned from his state position and took off for Hollywood, bringing several Indians with him to be in a live prologue Paramount used to introduce the feature. McCoy toured with this group and the picture all over America and Europe, and returned to Hollywood afterwards to secure further work as a technical advisor with an eye to becoming an actor.\n\n…Ford Beebe started in the industry in 1916 as a writer at Universal, also scripting the Helen Holmes serials produced and directed by J.P. MacGowan. That experience made Beebe able to move in 1920 to writing and directing western two-reelers for Universal featuring Hoot Gibson and Leo Maloney. Beebe and Maloney struck up a friendly working relationship that led to Beebe following Maloney over to the western star’s own Malobee Productions in 1922, where Ford wrote and directed Maloney’s self-produced short and feature westerns for Pathé release.\n\n…LAW BEYOND THE RANGE is actually a newspaper/political drama masquerading in the sagebrush. Tim McCoy plays Tim Mcdonald, who is dismissed from the Texas Rangers for letting his friend Johnny Kane (Robert Allen) escape when he is accused of murder. So Tim sets off to a town where the local newspaper is run by his friend George Alexander, who dies mysteriously as his paper is taking on local rober baron Daniel Heston and his mob. To save the paper, Tim becomes its editor-in=chief, and continues the crusade against Heston, even getting involved with the local election and Alexander’s nifty daughter (Billie Seward).\n\n…LAW BEYOND THE RANGE was one of Tim McCoy’s last Columbia westerns. His five-year contract was expiring, and he was looking to move elsewhere. His fellow Columbia cowboy Buck Jones had moved to Universal for the 1933-34 season. The same year Harry Cohn decided to put McCoy in different hats and star him in an action series of features where he played policemen, firemen, auto racers and interestingly, newspaper reporters. Though McCoy proved himself capable in these different roles, Jones’ departure and McCoy’s own love of the West returned him to boots and saddles for 1934-35. This last season had produced some of McCoy’s best films, yet Tim perhaps unwisely signed with producer Sigmund Newfield to make independent westerns for his Puritan Pictures for the 1936-37 season. McCoy would get the same money he had gotten at Columbia, but the films cut corners in lower production budgets, though they are still solid westerns and McCoy’s fine acting skills keep them interesting.\n\nMcCoy then also made the same mistake that many of his fellow cowboy stars made in the 30s that guaranteed bankruptcy—he formed his own touring wild west show. These moving money-holes had also wiped out Tom Mix, Ken Maynard and Buck Jones. McCoy was no different, after several years with it, he was forced to close and return full-time to the movie business. By 1940, the western market was tighter than ever, and the Hopalong Cassidy three-man trio formula: older star, younger romantic hero, and comic sidekick, became a popular trend in B westerns. The older stars found themselves close-out packaged into team series like Republic’s popular Three Mesquiteers franchise. Both in need of funds and careers sagging, McCoy and Buck Jones signed with Monogram to find themselves triple-billed with silent-film veteran Raymond Hatton playing a crusty-but-capable comic sidekick as the “Rough Riders,” three U.S. Marshalls who would ride into town incognito and clean it up. This series turned out to e both amazingly good and very successful for the 1941-42 season, but it sadly ended with the untimely death of Buck Jones in the Copacabana Nightclub fire in Boston in 1942, and Tim McCoy’s reactivation of his lieutenant-colonel commission at the start of World War Two.\n\nMcCoy was already tiring of the movie business—an unsuccessful political campaign as the Republican nominee for Wyoming senator would have removed him from the series had he won. McCoy remained in the military until the end of the war, and in the late 40s found himself yet again a civilian, so he returned to touring in wild west shows, continuing into the 1970s. In the 50s, he would host western movie showings on Los Angeles television, and film his own 30 minute Tim McCoy Show in 1952 where he would talk on all aspects of western and historical lore. He also made occasional movie appearance like his cameo in Mike Todd’s Around the World in 80 Days (1956) and supporting role in Run of the Arrow (1957). McCoy also had operated and lived on a Bucks County, Pennsylvania farm he had bought in the 1940s, where he had met his second wife, the jet-setting Swedish news photographer and journalist Inga Arvad, and they later moved to a new home in the Southern part of Arizona between Fort Huachuca and Nogales, where he wrote his autobiography, “Tim McCoy Remembers the West” in the mid 1970s. He passed away in Fort Huachuca on January 29, 1978.\n\nAfter the Laurel and Hardy short: MEN O’ WAR (1929), CALIFORNIA STRAIGHT AHEAD! (1938) was introduced by author Scott Eyman whose latest biography is “John Wayne: The Life and Legend”. Never much of a John Wayne fan myself, I was interested in seeing this little-known film where Wayne plays Biff Smith, a school bus driver, who goes into the trucking business with old buddy Charlie Porter (Emerson Treacy). They go up against the local trucking company monopoly who do all they can to make the two partners life difficult, including a nasty trick which ends up causing Charlie’s death. This shakes Biff up all the more, considering he was the one who was originally suppose to have driven the truck containing that particular load of nitrate-glycerine. This leaves love interest Charlie’s sister Mary (Louise Latimer) and his mother (Grace Goodall) at odds with their feelings for Biff who had promised that Charlie would never have had to drive a truck carrying something so dangerous.\n\nBy the end of the film, Biff is racing against time—and a freight train—to get his load of aviation parts to the other end of the country. Will he make it?\n\nI had to miss CRAZY HOUSE (1943), directed by Edward F. Cline, featuring Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson. I heard from some friends who viewed it that it was their least favourite film of the festival, so I didn’t feel too badly. I wanted to see the last two films but failed miserably.\n\nThe first was THE FIGHTING EAGLE (1927), directed by Donald Crisp, starring Rod La Rocque and Phyllis Haver. I like those two actors and except for some sword fighting here and there while wearing a crazed smile on our hero’s face, I really have no idea what the story was about.\n\nSo here’s what John McElwee had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\nTalking pics that mocked, or paid “affectionate” tribute, to the silent era would often re-stage sword duels where under-cranked heroics roused both laughs and memory of vanished movie-going. Singin’ in the Rain, Dreamboat, and more recent The Artist convinced us that here was voiceless action in a nutshell, but how close was simulations to the real thing long out of circulation? THE FIGHTING EAGLE and survivors like it might provide an answer. Rod La Rocque as a cavalier lead seems ripe for later parody, as few romancers from the 20s date so floridly, the name La Rocque suggesting press agentry ideal to dress a marquee, and yet…it was his own. Could providence gift a future thespian with so splendid a lable as “Rod La Rocque”? He’d thrive so long as titles did talking for him. With sound, however, came cruel ruination, for Rod’s was a voice utterly lacking in expression, less like a film star than your neighbor selling brooms for the Rotary Club. (I always thought he sounded like a less enthusiastic Vincent Price—Caren).\n\nWhatever glamour clung to La Rocque got stripped away too by shifting taste in screen idols. He’d hang on, work from time to time, and stay lifelong wed to Vilma Banky, their ceremony an ultimate of Hollywood artifice that disguised true commitment beneath. La Rocque had keen insight into fame and fleeting nature of same, his interview in The Real Tinsel outstanding among many in that compilation of celebrity chats.\n\nTHE FIGHTING EAGLE came toward a finish for silent, being produced by Cecil B. DeMille for the independent company he had established after leaving Paramount. DeMille had to watch pennies in his own shop, so farmed out direction for THE FIGHTING EAGLE (Donald Crisp gets the credit) and kept spending to minimum. We might speculate as to C.B.’s creative contribution, even as period-set action and costume flavor suggest guiding hand of the epic-maker. DeMille might well have been distracted by business matters however, for his indie output, released through Pathe, saw tough time getting dates at better theatres (more detail in Scott Eymans fine DeMille bio).\n\nAs with Fairbanks vehicles and the last couple Valentino did, THE FIGHTING EAGLE was not to be taken too seriously. Critics noted with approval a light touch brought to bear on this yarn built around Napoleon-era intrigue, Rod La Rocque a young braggart who gets in hot water for claiming close alliance with the Emperor.\n\nTHE FIGHTING EAGLE is fun sampling of programmers that satisfied fan-base in 1927, its berth shared at most venues by live vaudeville, plethora of short subjects, or music recital. In whatever mix, here was a programmer typical of its day, aided by extras to fill an evening’s time and money’s worth.\n\nHoping to stay awake and be frightened by the last film of the evening, THE MONKEY’S PAW (1948), not only was it no-thrills a minute, but it was unintentionally funny when one actor would mumble something in possibly a Scottish accent while his partner would reply in very clear English. So I’m sorry to say I really have no comment here either. I do hope those kids sitting in the first row who were allowed to stay up late, followed the story better than I did and got a chill or two out of it.\n\nHere’s what Bob Bloom had to say in the Cinevent notes:\n\nW.W. Jacobs’ “The Monkey Paw” was first published in 1902. The story centers on Mr. and Mrs. White and their adult son, Herbert. Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend of the Whites who served with the British Army in India, introduces them to the monkey’s paw, telling of its mysterious powers to grant three wishes and of its journey from an old fakir to his comrade, who used his third wish to wish for death. Sergeant-Major Morris, having had a bad experience upon using the paw, throws it into the fire but White quickly retrieves it. Morris warns White, but White, thinking about what the paw could be used for ignores him.\n\nAt Herbert’s suggestion, Mr. White wishes for £200 to be used as the final payment on his house, even though he believes he has everything he wants. The next day his son, Herbert, leaves for work at a local factory. Later that day, word comes to the White home that Herbert has been killed in a machinery accident. Although the employer denies any responsibility, the firm makes a goodwill payment to the Whites. The amount is £200.\n\nTen days after their son’s death and a week after the funeral, Mrs. White, almost mad with grief, asks her husband to use the paw to wish Herbert back to life. Reluctantly, he does so. Shortly afterwards there is a knock at the door. Mrs. White fumbles at the locks in an attempt to open the door. Mr. White knows, however, that he cannot allow their revived son in, as his appearance will be too hideous. Mr. White was required to identify the body, which had been mutilated by the accident. It has now been buried for more than a week. While Mrs. White tries to open the door, Mr. White makes his third wish. The knocking stops. Mrs. White opens the door to find no one there.\n\nThe story has been brought to the screen in several variations starting in 1915. Radio and television adaptations also have been plentiful. The 1948 film follows the basic plot, but in this version, the father wishes for the money in order to pay off a gambling debt and the son is killed in a motorcycle race. After the tragedy, his parents get the winning purse.\n\nA contributor from the United Kingdom, writing under the name of Spikeopath, who commented on the film at the Internet Movie Database, wrote, “It’s such a strong premise in the story it has been mined many a time over the decades, in film, radio and televisions. Here we go back to a time of British cinema of minimal budgets, straight backed delivery of scripts and economical running times of just an hour. Norman Lee’s film is a splendid piece of atmospheric unease that makes the most of some sparse but effective sets, however, that is on proviso you can allow for its obvious limitations. It’s safe to say this will not terrify anybody, but it has the capacity to tingle the spine as the story builds to a finale played out in the flashes and bangs of a thunder storm. Right there, before a cheeky coda, suggestion is everything, proof once more that quite often what you don’t see is more frightening. …”\n\nTo view the film online, click here.\n\nI hope to eventually get Day 4 immortalized here so stay tuned.\n\nSunday, June 5, 2016 – Day 4\n\nThe last day of Cinevent also happened to be my birthday and what could be the best gift ever but spending it at a vintage film convention with fun film friends?\n\nNot that I couldn’t have watched it again, but since I had already seen THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID (1929) a couple of times and had written about it under my Short Reviews 2014 I chose to skip it this time around. It’s directed by A. Edward Sutherland, starring Clara Bow, Jean Arthur, James Hall, Edna May Oliver and a very early, uncredited bit part for Jean Harlow. If you want to read my review, click on the link above and scroll down to April 24th.\n\nTo watch the film online, click here.\n\nSince it was a Clara Bow kind-of morning, the next film was KID BOOTS (1926), directed by Frank Tuttle, with Clara Bow, Eddie Cantor, Billie Dove and Lawrence Gray. I recognized a small scene at the beginning of this film, realizing I must have seen it sometime in the distant past, possibly when Toronto Film Society ran its Silent Series.\n\nIt’s the cute and funny story of a nebishy tailor’s apprentice, Samuel “Kid” Boots (Eddie Cantor) who falls for dumb bully Big Boyle’s (Malcolm Waite) girlfriend, Clara (Clara Bow). When Kid gets fired from the clothing business he ends up working for good-looking, wealthy Tom Sterling (Lawrence Gray) who is divorcing his wife Carmen (Natalie Kingston). But when Carmen discovers that Tom has inherited a bundle of money, she, with her lawyer, scheme to keep the marriage appear intact by hook or by crook.\n\nMeanwhile Tom and sidekick Boots head off to a swanky hotel resort where—surprise, surprise—Clara and her dumb-cluck boyfriend happen to be working. There are lots of fun shenanigans that befall the kooky couple which totally endear Cantor and Bow to their audience, namely us! Tom, in the meantime, falls for Eleanore Belmore (Billie Dove) who’s vacationing with her father (William Worthington).\n\nTom wants to avoid any hanky-panky with Eleanore until his divorce comes through while Carmen and her lawyer do everything they can to make it appear as if Tom has spent the night with her to show that she is still sleeping with her husband. This backfires on Carmen when Tom sends Boots to take his place in his boudoir while he heads off to another town to avoid being caught in Carmen’s snare. But his car has an accident which messes up his alibi. And all of this comes to a head in the courtroom finale.\n\nThere is a most entertaining scene where Boots (typical guy) tries to make Clara jealous by pretending he’s lunching with Carmen, who had “vamped” him earlier and agreed to meet him for a date. Clara is sitting at the next table. When Carmen doesn’t show up, he hides her half of the table behind an open door, feminizes his left hand and arm and delights us with an amorous pantomime.\n\nNatalie Kingston, in my estimation, was quite beautiful. She started out in 1923 playing in many shorts at Sennett’s Keystone “Fun Factory”, while her last uncredited bit part was in Only Yesterday (1933). A short career although she lived a long life, dying at the age of 86.\n\nHere’s some of what Michael Schlesinger and the late Steven Haynes had to say about the film:\n\nThe first of Eddie Cantor’s two silent comedies. Here’s an example of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat: making a silent movie out of a Ziegfeld Broadway musical comedy is not necessarily a smart idea, even if you’re bringing over Eddie Cantor (in his feature debut) to repeat his role, but making Clara Bow the female lead (played on Broadway by Mary Eaton of Cocoanuts infamy) made it a commercial hit…. (Michael Schlesinger)\n\nVariety had this to say about the popular stage performer’s big screen debut: “Eddie Cantor has arrived on the screen. Jesse Leaky stated that Cantor was a ‘natural’ for the screen before the rank and file in New York had seen the comedian’s first screen effort, KID BOOTS. It looks that way. […] Cantor is a “natural’ in more ways than one, as far as the screen is concerned. In fact, he has such a sense of natural comedy that those working with him were often broken up and hard put to it as Eddie would improvise a piece of business that was not in the script. As far as pictures are concerned, Eddie need not worry as to his future. He is set if ever a comedian was, and with his first effort.” This success was no doubt helped by the pairing with Clara Bow—in addition to benefiting from her previous film experience, it undoubtedly didn’t hurt that: “Clara and Cantor developed an immediate rapport, based on their similar backgrounds: born in a New York City ghetto and orphaned in early childhood, Cantor began entertaining professionally at age fourteen and was once a singing waiter at Coney Island, a job Robert Bow craved but was too incompetent to attain. Like Clara, Cantor’s fame had not enlarged his ego, and KID BOOTS’ cast and crew were often treated to songs and comedy routines between shots. Cantor also helped Clara with her comic timing, and in return she taught him how to play the camera. ‘She told me, Be yourself!’ the comedian wrote. ‘She is. She is never camera-conscious and acts on the set as she would in her home.’ One scene in KID BOOTS called for Clara to squabble with Cantor, and to his astonishment she simultaneously expressed anger and offered encouragement ‘While the camera ground away and caught all her pretty frowns, she was really saying, Eddie, ya doin’ fine! Just flash them banjo eyes and there ain’t nothing to it!” (David Stenn in “Runnnin’ Wild”)\n\nIt also never hurts that Cantor developed a good rapport with the director. In his autobiography “They Started Talking”, Frank Tuttle wro"
