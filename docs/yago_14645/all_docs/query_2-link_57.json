Byron’s story, captured so eloquently in his book, Step Out on Nothing, reminds us all of the profound interconnection between language competency and speech fluency,” added Fraser.\n\nAlso honored was Lyne Pitts, Emmy award-winning executive producer for CBS’ The Early Show and the CBS Evening News.\n\n“As we saw in The King's Speech, a strong and supportive spouse can be an incredible asset to all who stutter. We know that the role of family, and particularly that of the spouse, can be critical,” said Fraser."
