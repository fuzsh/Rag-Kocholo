        "text": "Jeff Wieger passed away in his home, in Teller County, on Wednesday June 26th. He was surrounded by his wife, children and loved ones.\n\nHe was born in Colorado Springs on January 10,1954 to Clifford and Mary Wieger. He attended Cheyenne Mountain High School where he met and later married his wife Shelley of 50 years. They raised three wonderful children: Saundra (Buck), Jenny (Dillon) and Jason.\n\nJeff was a plumber/pipefitter most of his career. Then a Stationery Engineer at Fort Carson until his retirement.\n\nJeff had a great love of the outdoors and passed that down all the way to his great-grandchildren. He loved teaching his children at a very young age about camping, hiking, repelling, caving, prospecting for gold and rocks, but mostly about respecting mother earth. Jeff was a master woodworker, who created many amazing pieces, pieces that made it all the way to Ireland.\n\nHe was happiest at his home, on his land with his wife, his dogs and always with family nearby.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his brother-in-law and best friend Jeff Straight. He is survived by his wife and three children, mother-in-law Bonnie Mericle, his brother Clifford Jr (Diana), his sister Nancy Hyde (Brian), his little brother Jim, his sister-in-law Susan Hatfield (Rick). He has seven grandchildren Matthew (Katie), Tyler, Zion (Stephanie), Kaya, Kimmy (Scott), Jeffrey and Justin and one step-grandson Kris. Three great-grandsons Zayden, Soren and Colton. And numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nA celebration of Jeff’s life will be held at his home on July 20th at 2:00 pm. Please reach out if you need the address and directions.\n\nJeffrey’s Celebration of Life"
