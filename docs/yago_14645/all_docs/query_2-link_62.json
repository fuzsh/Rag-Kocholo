        "text": "Born and raised in Hattiesburg, MS, Craig put his faith in Jesus and was baptized as a child at First Baptist Church Hattiesburg (renamed Venture in 2009). As a middle schooler, Craig felt God calling Him to something more. Following his 1998 graduation from Hattiesburg High, Craig attended Mississippi State University where he studied business and met his wife, Katie. After earning a Bachelor of Business degree, Craig began a career in sales, and he and Katie were married in June of 2005. Soon after, Craig and Katie began serving in full-time ministry together overseas. They served with the International Mission Board in Central Asia from 2006 - 2008 where Katie taught English and Craig coached football. They returned to the States in 2008, and Craig joined the staff of Pinelake Church, a multi-site church in central Mississippi, as the Students and College Pastor, later transitioning to the role of Groups Pastor. While on staff at Pinelake, Craig served on both the Clinton and Starkville campuses. During this season, the Curtis family grew as they welcomed their son Mac (now 16) and daughter Rosie (now 13). In 2012, the Curtis family returned to Hattiesburg and Craig joined the Venture staff team where he has served in many capacities, including as the Campus Pastor of The Lincoln Road Campus, Venture’s broadcast campus. In May of 2024, Craig was selected to serve as Venture’s next Lead Pastor. One who never meets a stranger, Craig has a zeal for both people and his faith and is excited about leading Venture’s growing church family into the next season of ministry throughout South Mississippi. Craig also loves running, playing tennis, watching his kids play soccer, traveling with his family, and all things Mississippi State.\n\nByron grew up in church, with his father serving as lead pastor across several churches in South Mississippi. After giving his life to Christ at the age of 7, Byron continued to serve in church alongside his family, where he began to feel a call to ministry. After graduating from Mississippi College, Byron married his wife of 35 years, Donna. Byron obtained his Master of Arts in Religious Education (M.A.R.E.) from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, during which he served as the Student Pastor of Richland Hills Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. Byron and Donna then returned to Mississippi, where he served for 9 years at First Baptist Church McComb as the Student Pastor, Minister of Church Recreation, and Minister of Church Education. In 1998, Byron officially became a part of Venture Church Staff (then, First Baptist Hattiesburg) where he has since served in a variety of ministry areas including Student Pastor, Pastor of Family Ministries, and Hunt Club Campus Pastor. Byron currently serves as an Executive Pastor of Venture Church, and his responsibilities include the LEAD Apprenticeship Program, Pastor to Campus Pastors, and the Interim Director of Next Gen Ministries. Byron's favorite hobby is spending time with his wife and his three children, Raley, Caedon, and Garon. His favorite part of serving at Venture Church is the people – both the ones he ministers to and serves alongside.\n\nJeff May accepted Christ at the age of twelve. After decades of wrestling with a call to ministry, he surrendered to “full-time Christian service” at the age of 38. Jeff graduated from The University of Southern Mississippi with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 1983. Prior to joining the Venture Church staff in 2015, he had a 32-year career in Information Technology Management and Business Management. Jeff is currently the Executive Pastor of Administration at Venture, overseeing all aspects of Venture's financial and personnel operations. What Jeff loves most about serving at Venture Church is the deep conviction that any person can be redeemed by God through a relationship with Jesus. He and his wife, Emma, are residents of Petal and have three children and six grandchildren. Jeff enjoys wearing Hawaiian shirts, cheering on the USM Eagles, and sharing his faith in Jesus with others seeking to know, love, and follow Jesus.\n\nKyle grew up in church, but in his middle school years, he began following Jesus.

In 2018, Kyle began serving on staff with the Hunt Club team, and he has since helped launch The Jones County Campus. Kyle currently serves as the Executive Pastor of Ministries, overseeing all ministry teams at Venture Church. Kyle, his wife, Brooke, and their daughter, Charli Kate, currently worship and serve at the Jones County Campus.
