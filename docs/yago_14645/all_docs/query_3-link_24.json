        "text": "Paul, Jeffrey (Jeff) Edward 64 of Byron, MN (formerly Bloomington), passed away October 11, 2023, at Seasons Hospice House in Rochester. A Celebration of Life will be held at Saint Joan of Arc Catholic Community in Minneapolis on Saturday, November 11. The service will begin at 11 AM with Visitation 90-minutes prior, in the church.\n\nThe service will be live streamed beginning at 10:30 AM on Saturday, November 11 using this link: https://youtube.com/live/46zFD0x_GQA?feature=share\n\nJeff was born in Faribault, MN to Vincent and Elizabeth (Wolter) Paul on August 21, 1959. He graduated from Bethlehem Academy in 1978 and programs at South Central College in Faribault, Central Lakes College in Brainerd, and Normandale Community College in Bloomington.\n\nYou can read all about his medical trials and tribulations, which began over 25 years ago, on his CaringBridge website named JeffEPaul or caringbridge.com/visit/jeffepaul.\n\nThe majority of Jeff’s lifework was with two companies. He managed convenience stores, primarily for Holiday Stationstores, and worked in the Ad Warehouse and Consumer Services at General Mills. He spent over 20 years in Consumer Services where he had a close bond with all his colleagues.\n\nJeff was an avid and talented golfer. One of his fondest memories was golfing the Hualālai Golf Course on the Big Island of Hawaii. He enjoyed watching Gopher hockey at Mariucci Arena, Oregon Ducks football at Autzen Stadium, and, of course, watching both on television. He loved catching and releasing fish from the dock of his wife’s family home on Gull Lake. Rumor had it he married me for my parents’ lake home.\n\nHe enjoyed David Attenborough’s narration on television’s Planet Earth and The Blue Planet. Unlike me, Jeff loved all kinds of nature shows, reminding me how different some of our viewing habits could be. I only know what magma is because of Jeff! Together, we enjoyed comedy shows like Seinfeld, Mom, and many others. I literally would record his laughing, without him knowing it, and listening to it now still brings me such joy. One year his co-workers even gave him a fusilli Jerry for his birthday.\n\nJeff had a quirky sense of humor. He was quick to assign nicknames to many people he met. He called Kelli, our Bloomington neighbor across the hall, “Wheels,” when she got a scooter. He’d randomly say off the wall things. One day while carpooling to work (something we did for years), we were talking about the grocery list. He again insisted he hated grocery shopping, but honestly, I think he loved it. And one thing’s for sure…he sure didn’t want ME doing it as I made “too many impulse purchases!” Anyway, he said “I can be persuaded by price and a coupon!” So, he worked for a major food company but had no brand loyalty?\n\nJeff didn’t have pets growing up. What parents would be crazy enough to raise 6 boys and allow a pet into their home? Regardless, he loved being a dog Dad to our Shelties, Frasier, Mason, Luna and now Macy.\n\nJeff and I were fortunate to travel a bit, especially when I worked for Northwest Airlines. We got to Portland often, where Jeff spent endless hours playing sports and watching questionable footage with his 4 nephews. They really bonded. We loved the Big Island of Hawaii. Jeff was a stroke survivor (March 1999) and walked the Kona Marathon in 2004, raising over $10K for the American Stroke Association! When we visited, he showed me the path of the race.\n\nJeff is survived by his favorite wife Julie deRosier-Paul of Byron, MN, Sheltie Macy, brother Michael (Amy Engel) of San Diego, CA; sister-in-law Agnes Paul (Wayne Ause) of Vancouver, WA; brother Greg (Mary Hart-Paul) of Raleigh, NC; sister-in-law Judy Paul of Wayzata, MN; brother Joseph (Elisa) of Coon Rapids, MN, sister-in-law Debbie Rachey (Brian) of Champlin, MN, brother Daniel (Colleen) of Jacksonville, FL, mother-in-law Phyllis deRosier of Brainerd, MN, brother-in-law Mitchell deRosier of Brainerd, MN, brother-in-law Marcel (Susan) of Coon Rapids, MN and brother-in-law Jon deRosier (Janet) of Brooklyn Center, MN.\n\nHe's also survived by these nieces and nephews: James Paul (Cheryl) John Paul (Sarah), Stephen Paul (Claire Von Derau), Godson Kevin Paul (Kristen), Hillary Halpern (Noah), Jared Paul (Nora Vogel), Ana Paul, Casey Mareck (Ali), Melissa Paul, Rachel Paul, Danny Paul (Cora), Godson Adam (Patti) deRosier, Clara deRosier Albert (Jon Albert), Andrew (Sarah) Tschumper, Caleb deRosier, Nathan deRosier, Lauren deRosier and Elijah deRosier.\n\nAnd the next generation of great nieces and nephews: Shawn, Owen, Robinson, Birdie, Marlowe, Evan, Jacoby, River, Sylvia, Tripp, Austin, Lena, Ottilie, Bella and Louis.\n\nJeff is pre-deceased by his paternal and maternal grandparents, his parents, brother Thomas, father-in-law Joseph deRosier, brother-in-law Maurice deRosier and Shelties Frasier, Mason, and Luna.\n\nJeff was accepted into the Mayo Clinic Body Donation Program for the purpose of medical education, research and surgical training, and the development and testing of new surgical devices and techniques. Interment at Saint Lawrence Cemetery in Faribault, Minnesota will be later.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials to honor Jeff are preferred to charities that enriched his life. They include Family Services Rochester, Gilda’s Club Twin Cities, Minnesota Sheltie Rescue, No Dog Left Behind and Open Arms of Minnesota."
