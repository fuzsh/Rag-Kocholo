Railroad Beginnings in the U.S.

Transporting goods was the driving force in the development of railroads in the United State. Trains could potentially reach more markets faster. Some of the early railroad cars were pulled by horses. The first railroad that was constructed for the transportation of freight and passengers in this country was the Baltimore and Ohio. Fifteen miles were opened on May 15, 1830.

Fitchburg Railroad

The Fitchburg Railroad, chartered in 1843, was opened to Fitchburg on March 5th, 1845. Investors worried that there would not be enough profits. However, the Fitchburg Railroad began to pay well, very soon after its completion.

Extending the rail line to the West required drilling the Hoosac Tunnel. Drilling began in 1851 and was completed in 1876. It was sold to the Fitchburg Railroad Company along with the Troy and Greenfleld Railroad by the State of Massachusetts in 1887. By 1896, the Fitchburg Railroad Company had obtained the Vermont & Massachusetts, the Boston, Barre & Gardner, the Troy & Boston, the Cheshire, and the Boston, Hoosac Tunnel & Western. The company also owned 204 locomotives. In 1900 the Boston & Maine bought the Fitchburg Railroad. Today you can ride a commuter train from Boston to Fitchburg operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.

Story Problems

1. If the train to Fitchburg traveled 15 mph and the distance was 30 miles, how long was the ride for Henry's friend?

2. Locomotive Speed

"The Lowell Courier says that a new engine

called the Camilla, built by Hinkley & Drury,

and designed for speed, on the Boston and

Lowell Railroad, has driving wheels of 6k

feet diameter, and is capable of running a

mile in a minute."

How many miles per hour would the train travel?

Ticket Cost Comparison

1. If the distance from Concord to Fitchburg, Massachusetts is 30 miles and the cost of the ticket in 1845 is 90 cents, how much did it cost per mile?

2. If the distance from Concord to Fitchburg, Massachusetts is 30 miles and the cost of the ticket in 2001 is $3.00, how much does it cost per mile?

3. Compare the cost in 1845 with the cost in 2001.

Baggage Check/Claim

A checking system was invented to keep track of luggage being transported on the trains. Metal disks or checks were placed on each item and a duplicate given to the passenger. At the final destination, the check was presented to claim the luggage. The example on the left is a "through" tag. The item traveled over several railroad lines.

Fitchburg

Boston Hoosac Tunnel & Western RR

New York, West Shore & Buffalo

Grand Trunk

The manufacturer's mark is also stamped on the check which was a common advertising practice during that time period.

Economy

"One says to me, 'I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to travel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg today and see the country.' But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents.... Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night;... You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare, and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day."

- Henry David Thoreau Walden
