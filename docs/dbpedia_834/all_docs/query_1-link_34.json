        "text": "The railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world: the world's first locomotive-hauled public railway opened in 1825. Most of the railway track is managed by Network Rail, which in 2015 had a network of 15,760 kilometres (9,790 mi) of standard-gauge lines, of which 5,272 kilometres (3,276 mi) were electrified. These lines range from single to quadruple track or more. In addition, some cities have separate rail-based mass transit systems (including the extensive and historic London Underground). There are also several private railways (some of them narrow-gauge), which are primarily short tourist lines. The British railway network is connected with that of continental Europe by an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSzWnbPF8yE\n\nAmericans view trains as something archaic, the thing of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAnyone who has any form of interest in railways should know that very basic fact ,in fact the first steam operated railway is even earlier , 1804 when Trevithick ran steam operated locos in a coal mine in Wales . Of course , horse drawn railways operated even earlier . I think I knew that when I was about six years old, they used to teach it at school in the 1950s . I wonder why some folk presume the USA is first at everything ?\n\nThe railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world: the world's first locomotive-hauled public railway opened in 1825.

The first American railway was the B&O, 1827. We imported our rolling stock and rails from the Brits originally.\n\nWe sure did import our stuff from Great Britain.\n\nOne of the earliest railways in the US was the Quincy Granite RR built to haul granite blocks from the Quincy quarries. There's a preserved portion of the tracks, which dates back to 1826.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite_Railway\n\nThe rails and locomotive were imported from Great Britain and the sleepers were fashioned from granite blocks.\n\nA short time later in 1831, the Boston and Lowell, was built between the namesake cities and opened in 1835. They too used granite sleepers with iron rails imported Great Britain along with locomotives and wagons with the first Planet class 2-2-0 being built by Robert Stephenson, and subsequent locomotives being built locally in Lowell. The passengers loved they could make the 45 minute trip between Boston and the namesake city at speeds up to 60 mph. (That's the same time it takes to make the same commuter trip today!), however, the granite sleepers made for a very bouncy and uncomfortable ride. In 1838 the company double-tracked the line and gave in and used wooden sleepers just as other lines did including the connecting Andover and Wilmington (Boston and Maine), Providence and Worcester and Boston and Providence, among others.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_and_Lowell_Railroad\n\nSome of the old granite sleepers were discovered a few years ago while doing some track work along the line between Wilmington and Billerica. I don't know what happened to them, but I think they have been preserved.\n\nTo add a bit to our British legacy, the loading gauge for our local railroads is quite narrow compared to other parts of the US with some areas as close as 4 meters if not closer as well as low bridge heights, and lower tunnels.\n\nEDIT:\n\nDesign docs for local transit authority:\n\nhttps://bc.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/B...rack and Roadway March 8 2008 Revision_O1.pdf\n\nNote the loading gauge for double track... This isn't the 4.5 meters or wider found elsewhere. This presents a problem with double-tracked freight and passenger operations with wider the freight cars we now use. In some areas, such as Lawrence, MA, for example, the freight line is single tracked and away from the platform of the new station on a runaround passing loop.\n\nThis gives frog designs, etc. which might be useful.\n\nhttps://bc.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/B...rack and Roadway March 8 2008 Revision_O2.pdf"
