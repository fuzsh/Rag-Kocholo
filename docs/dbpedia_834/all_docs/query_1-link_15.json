        "text": "US Rail History for Idiots v.2\n\n1800's: People begin thinking about trains and some are made. They begin pretty well. Later huge booms come in and rails replace canals as the main mode of transportation. Train tracks are made at an astounding rate and by the latter half on the 1800's there were tracks going from California to the east coast.\n\n1900's: Steam engines are king in the first half of the century. Locomotives are made very fast and trains are modernizing at the speed of light! In 1900 trains were still quite small, but in the 1920's we had mighty 2-10-2's rolling along like thunder. During WWII we had enormous trains like the 4-8-8-4, 2-8-8-8-2, and 4-6-6-4 pulling freight and passenger trains. During and after the 1950's we began modernizing to diesel locomotives on a large scale and most steamers were scrapped. Then new diesels like the E- and F- units came along. Although, lets not forget the many great ALCo's that came, too, like the PA/B and FA/B to name a couple. As we went along, we got to more modern engines like GP and SD 7's and 9's. By the 70's we had trains like the SD40-2 and similar trains.\n\n2000's: So far we have been making better trains that are more efficient and stuff like that.\n\nThe End\n\n2 paragraphs, eh? Challenge Accepted.\n\nAfter the first handful of railroads (B&O, D&H, SC) showed that the concept was viable here, railroads sprung up like wildfire. Almost all towns clamored to have a railroad presence as the towns saw railroads as their outlet to the rest of the world and as economic drivers. Due to the possibility of increased tax revenues, many state legislators gave tax breaks and grants (usually land) to railroad companies. Until the 1860s, rail development was primarily in the eastern half of the country. With the transcontinental railroad project of the post-Civil War era, the federal government got into the grant giving game. Even after the Union Pacific and Central Pacific line was completed, other transcontinental routes still received land grants (except the Great Northern, because J.J. Hill was awesome). These land grants were far more land than was required to build on, and so the land the railroads got from the people of America for free was sold by the railroads to the people of America for a profit.\n\nOnce the transcontinental lines were pretty much finished in the late 19th century, construction of local rail lines continued up into the mid-1910s, when mileage hit its peak. From the late 19th century into the 1920s, advances in technology allowed trains to run faster, safer, farther and carry more. (in that era - from handbrakes to straight air brakes to automatic air brakes; automatic couplers; wide fireboxes, thanks to trailing trucks on steam; superheating; piston valves; block control signals; steel coaches; steam heat; etc...) Development of larger cars and more powerful engines has, naturally, continued to the present (although a shift to efficiency over power came in after the fuel crisis in the 1970s). Since the 1920s, the mileage of tracks in the country has been declining, mostly due to competition from trucks on short-haul freight runs. Affordable automobiles, the Interstate Highway System and cheap plane tickets nearly killed off passenger trains in the 1960s. The busiest of these trains from all railroads (except Southern and D&RGW) were taken over by Amtrak in 1971. Despite the best efforts of many politicians, Amtrak is still operating 40 years later.\n\nSomewhere in my home here in Scotland (hope it's still here) I should have a copy of the Assoc of American Railroads handbook dated back in the mid-1950's.\n\nIt was given to me a number of years ago and it is a fascinating tome altogether. It lists every company in America plus Canada, Mexico and Cuba (before the Revolution!). From tiny companies of a few miles to the big giants of yesteryear. I haven't seen it around for a while so must look in the loft as I would hate to think it was inadvertently thrown out. Although i am more interested in passenger stuff on Trainz especially from here where passenger still rules it is a moment of time in the history of American railways. It also included route maps and timetables of the big boys as well as the important staff in head offices, etc. If it is still here it should probably get a home back across the pond. From memory it was more than 2 inches maybe near 3 inches thick. Must have a search at the weekend because it it has been disposed of I will be annoyed!\n\n2 paragraphs, eh?

Despite the best efforts of many politicians, Amtrak is still operating 40 years later.\n\nThat is an excellent 2 paragraph synopsis.\n\nMike\n\nNew England region played a big part too in the development of railroads in the US back in the early decades of the 19th-century. The big network of textile mills, which started in Providence, Rhode Island, then later in Lowell and Lawrence, and Uxbridge, MA. were situated along rivers and canal systems. The Blackstone Canal, which ran alongside the Blackstone river between Providence and Worcester, was very busy with traffic in the early 1800s. There was a problem though. The canals provided transportation with the same water that was used to power the big textile mills. During the summer months, the water levels are much lower, and this caused the canals to dry up as the water was diverted in the mill sluice ways. Riots would break out between the canal boat operators and the mill owners over water rights. As time went on, one of the earliest railroads in the US was built - the Providence and Worcester. This railroad still exists as an independent shortline railroad, after being part of the the New Haven and later Penn Central briefly. The Middlesex Canal provided similar services between Lowell and Boston, and later on in the early 1840s the Boston and Lowell was built, and the canal company went out of business. The railroads had the advantage over the canals in other ways, besides being able to operate in nearly all kinds of weather. Remember when the winter comes, the canals freeze; in the summer, the water dries up. This made the service unpredictable, so the railroads shined by carrying goods and passengers year round. Another famous railroad was born around the same time - the Boston & Maine, which was founded in New Hampshire, but had subsidiaries all over. The old Andover and Wilmington served as a connection to the B&M, and eventually became part of the mainline to Portland Maine. Eventually the original A&W route was abandoned due to the rolling hills that it followed, and the B&M route, as we know it today, was laid around 1848.\n\nToday the mainline still exists for the B&M and P&W. The P&W is doing quite well, and nearly all of the exent system is their original line with a few extra B&M and Conrail spin-offs added in as well. The B&M went through major periods of boom and bust as the economy changed when the manufacturing facilities closed as jobs and companies moved away. By the late 1960s the B&M was bankrupt again, and the local transit authority - the MBTA - purchased all of the existing track in Massachusetts up to the borders from the B&M. The B&M was reorganized, and in the early 1980s, became part Guilford Transportation. What was once a Class I extending from Montreal Canada all the way to Troy, New York, and all the way east to Portland, Maine is only a shadow of its original self. Much of the trackage, other than the basic mainline from New Amsterdam, NY to Portland, is long gone, becoming trails or lay abandoned. The Main Central, another famous company, also became part of Guilford in the same period, and lost most of it's lines as well. Guilford has done its share of ripping up more trackage from the system, so what was once over a 10,000 mile system, is only about 500 miles or so long on the B&M, and probably less than that for the MEC. This is typical of US railroad history. They built a great network, with nearly 300,000 miles of trackage, and pare it down to nearly nothing today. This is sad because there are now areas where the tracks should be active again for passenger service, but the funds are not there to restore the lines, and the NIMBYs have moved, so they're becoming recreational trails.\n\nJohn\n\nFrom what i have read from the replies in this post, US railway history is similar to that of britain.\n\nSo to sum up, canals were built, but railways came along and showed they were better. The railways reached their peak in the 1920s, (much like britain) after that a period of decline set in.\n\nIn the 50s diesels started to replace steam, then in the 60s due to cars being cheap and affordable passenger trains were almost killed off. Then amtrak was started and passenger serveices were rejuvanated a bit.\n\nFrom their railway technology is slowly getting better again.\n\nI think thats about right.\n\nYou've got it!\n\nIn my area, the old Blackstone Canal and Middlesex, or what's left of this one, are now historical places. Along the Middlesex Canal, there are places where the tow ropes, used by the barges, have carved grooves into various places on some of the rocks.\n\nWhat's interesting too is some of the early rail routes actually paralleled the original canals. The Providence and Worcester runs right along side the Blackstone and in Connecticut the old New Haven Springfield line parallels the Connecticut river and the canal near Windsor Locks. There's also a mostly abandoned (recently, thanks to Guilford again), a former New Haven line called the Canal line which used to follow the canal path its self.\n\nAmtrak has been barely given a chance to develop a good transit system. I'm not going political here, but you know what I mean when I say there's a certain group of politicians that want to kill anything like that in favor of big cuts for the rich.\n\nJohn\n\nTo a degree there is similarity clambert however today Trainzers mimic the practical modern situation in both sides of the pond. In the US where mainline rail is now freight with miniscule passenger here it is the very opposite. So route builders here I have noticed are more into the passenger side and over the water the other. Kind of natural I would think as it is the situation in reality?\n\nVery true, Bobby. However in the Northeast this is very different, and very much like it is in the UK. This is at least here in the Greater Boston area where freight has all but disappeared with so many thanks to offshoring of manufacturing, and NIMBYs not wanting factory-smells, etc. in their backyards.\n\nWhere I am on the MBTA Haverhill line, which is also the Downeaster, Boston to Portland route, today sees very little freight. The big yard in Boston's North Station area, which was once one of the largest hump yard in the east, is long gone. The tracks have been ripped up to a couple sidings with only a few tracks here and there going to some warehouses. The rest has been built on by condo developers and shopping malls.\n\nThe big yard in Lawrence is now a through yard for classifying any freight that goes through there. The once bustling mills are empty, and the industrial park sees an occasional box car or covered hopper once in a while now.\n\nSo the main purpose of the remaining trackage is now for commuter service in and out of the Boston and surrounding suburbs on the North side. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was also a push to put the third-rail electric subway lines out into the suburbs. The Orange Line, which runs from Forest Hills in the south all the way to Oak Grove in Medford, was supposed to be extended north on the Haverhill line to Reading. This project ran out of steam and enthusiasm after the project ran out of money in the mid-1970s. There was also talk of extending the Red Line from Braintree in the south to Arlington and even Lexington, but the NIMBYs in Lexington didn't want the city folk in their neighborhood, and promptly killed that project. Today what's left of the ROW out to Bedford, where there's an airport, is now a bike path. Sadly this would have been an excellent route for passenger service because this area is so densely populated, the driving is horrible.\n\nJohn"
