The Boston and Maine section is further divided into Part 1. Reference Materials and Part 2. Railroad Documents.\n\nThe linked items below represent only a small part of the materials held in our physical Archives at 40 French Street Lowell. Download our CATALOG.

Horvath\n\nMaine Central Railroad\n\nThe Maine Central Railroad had a close relationship with the Boston and Maine Railroad throughout its history. The Eastern Railroad gained control of Maine Central in 1871. B&M leased ERR in 1884 and thereby controlled MEC. When, in 1907, New Haven gained control of the B&M, MEC came into the New Haven sphere. In 1914 a group of investors purchased a controlling interest in MEC from B&M and independence was re-established. This notwithstanding, from 1933 to 1955 the two railroads entered into an agreement to be operated as separate railroads under a common management and shared many general officers. In the Guilford/PanAm and CSX eras the two roads were operated as a single system.\n\nMany of the MEC materials that we present in our On-Line Archives were submitted and scanned by Archives Committee member David Ashenden.\n\nAbandonments\n\nAccident Investigation Reports - Interstate Commerce Commission, Federal Railroad Administration\n\nClinton, Me., Oct. 26, 1949\n\nAccounting Equipment, 1924 (MECRR Magazine)\n\nAnnual Reports\n\n1886-93\n\nChronology, 2020 (compiled by David Ashenden)\n\nChronology, 1976 (MEC Messenger)\n\nEmployee Magazine\n\nWe are grateful to Dick Glueck of the New England Steam Corporation for providing many issues of the MEC Employee Magazine for scanning and for giving us permission to make scans available on our website. Additional issues came from Rick Conard in 2022. Many hours of scanning time were contributed by Archives Committee member David Ashenden.
