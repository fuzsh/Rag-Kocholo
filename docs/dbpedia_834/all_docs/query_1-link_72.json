        "text": "The path of the current rail trail originally operated as the single-track Worcester & Nashua Railroad starting 1848. The track was extended to Portland, Maine, in 1874 and was taken over by the Boston & Maine Railroad in 1886. The original granite markers along the trail give the distance to Worcester and Portland.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Ayer-Nashua line carried a heavy load of freight traffic as well as passenger trains traveling between New York City and Bar Harbor, Maine.\n\nAlthough a second track and signals were added around 1912, most traffic moved to the rail line running from Ayer to Portland via Lowell, Mass. Passenger service on the Nashua line ended in 1934. Freight service ended in 1981."
