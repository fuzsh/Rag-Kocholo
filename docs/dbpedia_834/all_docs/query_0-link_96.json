And he succinctly explains how those roles have changed with our technology and our economy. In this revised and updated edition, he has displaced some chapters in the earlier edition, added a new map and new data, and updated and expanded the Suggested Reading. His new chapters survey the new age of railroads, the new problems and opportunities, mergers, and legislation. T h e need for this edition itself illustrates the dynamism of American history, and shows us how progress produces the challenges of obsolescence. If the recent history of American railroads lacks the expansive romantic drama of the earlier history, it does remain a touchstone of the flexibility of American institutions. Mr. Stover reminds us of the recurring problem in a nation of ever-advancing technology, of making the most of the enormous investment in earlier technologies. When an eminent British railroad builder, Edward Watkin, visited the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, he was appalled at how hastily and flimsily the Americans laid their tracks xi\n\nEditor’s Foreword to the Second Edition and built their bridges. H e contrasted them with the sturdy British lines which he said were built “to last for ever.” Americans, he complained, somehow did not realize that railroads were “a final improvement in the means of locomotion.” As Mr. Stover continues his account of the later history of American transportation in this new edition, he alerts our imaginations to the unpredictability of innovation, and the need to keep our institutions adaptable to the unexpected. DANIEL J. BOORSTIN\n\nxii\n\nEditor’s Foreword to the First Edition There are few more distinctively American subjects than the history of American railroads. While other nations too have had a railroad history, our nation of vast continental spaces has been decisively shaped by its means of transportation. Future historians may well divide American life since the early nineteenth century into an Age of the Railroad, followed by an Age of the Automobile, and then an Age of the Airplane. T h e Age of the Railroad is perhaps the most romantic. For the automobile and the airplane have flourished in an already industrial nation, but the railroad often encountered a virgin continent. Railroads came on the American scene when Indians were still a menace to westering settlers, when large expanses of North America had not yet become accustomed to the English language or the European mode of dress. While railroads in Europe were commonly the servants of established communities, in America railroads were often their creators. For most of the nineteenth century railroads were a symbol of the anachronism which was the romance and the strength of the new nation. But the Golden Age of the Railroads, as Mr. Stover vividly re...\n\nXlll\n\nEditor’s Foi-ewm-d to the First Edition minds us, is past. T h e peak in railroad mileage was reached in 1916. Since then the decline has been steady, and the process is not likely to be reversed. While that Golden Age is still a living memory, we might well try to recapture its spirit. In this brilliantly cogent story, Mr. Stover recalls that since their appearance on the American scene railroads have played a decisive role in nearly every major movement in our history. They were important in hastening the rise of the Atlantic seaboard metropolises, in peopling and supplying the West, in attracting and transporting immigrants, in shaping the enterprises of trappers, cowboys, miners, and farmers. In the twentieth century the commuting train has helped create and perpetuate the American suburbs. Railroads helped determine the course and the outcome of the Civil War, and were essential to victory in two world wars. T h e story of railroads, as Mr. Stover tells it, is a parable of the changing American economy and the changing role of government in American life. Here we see how the American economy has or has not been competitive. We see how government subsidy, regulation, and control have encouraged the rise of railroads, have shaped their maturity, and have helped make their lives difficult, feasible, profitable, or impossible. Here we see also how the American economy has been integrated, homogenized, and brought increasingly under government supervision. In this brief volume, Mr. Stover gives us a much-needed factual guide to a subject which too often overwhelms the amateur; and he draws these facts into the drama of a rising American civilization. By placing the history of American railroads in the main stream of American history, Mr. Stover admirably serves the purpose of the “Chicago History of American Civilization,” which aims to make every aspect of our past a window to all our history. T h e series contains two kinds of books: a chronological group, which provides a coherent narrative of American history from its beginxiv\n\nEditor? For-eword to the First Edition ning to the present day, and a topical group, which deals with the history of varied and significant aspects of American life. This book is one of the topical group.

T h e rich agricultural production of the country, the small but expanding factories of eastern cities, and the largely untapped natural resources of the nation-all of these called for improvements in transport. In the half-dozen years after the Treaty of Ghent nearly every state and large city started to agitate for an expanded system of internal improvements. Taverns and exchanges across the land heard the warm arguments of farmers, merchants, and politicians as they advanced the rival claims of canals and turnpikes, of steamboats and railroads. T h e domestic and western trade increased, even with the internal improvements still in the dream stage, and there was a relative decline in the importance of foreign trade. This was to be expected for the growing population, which was increasing roughly a third each decade, was on the march to the interior. T h e center of population, which in 1810 had been but a few miles up the Potomac from Washington, had moved by the eve of the Civil War to a spot west of Athens, Ohio. While in I 8 I j only four of the states had lacked a seacoast, the new states of the nest half-century were nearly all in the interior. I\n\nAmerican Railroads T h e expansion and growth were more than sectional. &John C. Calhoun (1782-1850), at the time a nationalist leader, said in 1817: “We are greatly and rapidly-I was about to say fearhllygrowing. This is our pride, and our danger; our weakness and our strength. . . . Let us, then, bind the Republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals.” Even before the nation had its roads and canals, Oliver Evans ( I 755-1819), the frustrated Philadelphia inventor and steam engine builder, was having a bigger dream. In I 8 I z Evans foresaw the day when “carriages propelled by steam will be in general use, as well for the transportation of passengers as goods, travelling a t the rate of fifteen miles an hour, or 300 miles per day.” T h e country first had to build its turnpikes, dig its canals, and fill its rivers with steamboats before it could construct its railroads. But it was the dream of Oliver Evans that was to bring much of the material progress gained in the new century. Farmers, factory owners, and merchants were soon to become impatient with the interruptions and delays of the slowmoving wagons and boats that were typical even with completed turnpikes and canals. They did not like to wait upon late winters, spring freshets, or muddy roads. They desired a form of land transport that was fast, cheap, and dependable. By the standards of the early nineteenth century even the first railroads soon were to provide that kind of transportation. With peace the nation quickly turned to internal improvements. Less than a month after the Battle of New Orleans, Colonel John Stevens (1749-1838) of Hoboken obtained from the New Jersey legislature the first railroad charter in America, a grant to build a railroad between the Delaware and Raritan rivers. In I 8 I 7, when the longest completed American canal extended less than 28 miles, the New York legislature authorized the building of the Erie Canal, a 364-mile project. T h e next year saw the completion of the Cumberland, or National, Road to Wheeling, Virginia, an event which made westward migration to the new states of Indiana 2\n\n‘2Perfect System of Roads and Canals” and Illinois much easier. T h e average western emigrant in I 8 I 8 probably floated down the Ohio River from Wheeling in a flatboat, but in that year a t least a dozen small, wheezing steamboats were already plying western rivers, a number destined to increase tenfold in a decade. Late in 1825 the westward movement was stimulated by the completion of the Erie Canal. Much earlier in that year Colonel Stevens had confounded his critics, who were pointing to his chartered but unbuilt railroad, by operating the first locomotive to run on rails in America. His sixteen-foot “Steam Waggon” carried hardy house guests around circular track on the grounds of his Hoboken estate a t the rate of 12 miles an hour. For half a generation after Ghent the roads and canals desired by Calhoun made most of the significant transportation headlines in America. Much progress in the construction of improved toll roads had been made before the War of 1812. Generally built by private-stock companies with charters from the state legislatures, the turnpikes were built along the major travel routes. T h e companies were allowed to gain a return on their investment by charging tolls on the traffic using the new road. The early success of the well-built Lancaster Turnpike, completed from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1794, resulted in a widespread demand for more roads. Dozens of turnpike companies planned and built roads in New England in the first years of the nineteenth century, and by 1825 a number of major roads criss-crossed southern New England. T h e record amount of land carriage caused by the blockade during the war with England made all sections of the country increase their road-building activity. T h e Pennsylvania legislature in I 8 16-1 7 granted state aid to 46 separate internal improvements, most of them turnpikes. By 1821 some 150 turnpike companies had been chartered in Pennsylvania, with state aid accounting for 35 per cent of the total subscribed capital of $6,401,000. Of the 1,807miles of completed roadway, about two-thirds was well con-\n\n3\n\nArne?-icanRailroads structed with stone surfacing. In the same year New York could boast of 4,000 miles of completed roads, but the absence of any large amounts of state aid probably explained the lighter construction and lower cost or capitalization per mile in the Empire State ($3,500 per mile in Pennsylvania and $2,750 per mile in New York). T h e rage for turnpikes was also present in the Old Northwest during the 1820s and 1830s, but few roads were ever completed, except in Ohio. In the southern states, except for Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, there was more promotion and planning than accomplished construction. Few of the turnpikes, North or South, ever achieved the profits promised by their promoters. New England was probably typical; only half a dozen of the 2 3 0 turnpike companies in the New England states ever returned their owners a reasonable dividend on investment. T h e National Road was the greatest of all the turnpikes. Despite its extension to Wheeling in 1818 and to Columbus, Ohio, in 1833, this broad artery to the West had its problems. Although the federal government had spent $1,300,000 on the road in the preceding six years, Postmaster General Return J. Meigs, Jr. (1764-1824), complained to Congress in January, 1823, that on a recent inspection trip he found “the western (being the newest) part of the road . . . in a ruinous state, and being rapidly impaired.” Along the route he saw rockslides and erosion so bad “that two carriages cannot pass each other.” Even with the advantage of turnpikes, freight rates were expensive. At the conclusion of the War of I 8 I z the lowest wagon freight rates averaged thirty cents per ton-mile and often were twice that. But farm produce was seldom carried overland. T h e reason was simple: transportation costs from Buffalo to New York City in I 8 I 7 were three times the market value of a bushel of wheat and six times that of corn. Wagon freight rates westward to Pittsburgh fell perhaps 50 per cent by I 82 2 , but this was brought about as much by a general deflation as by an increase in the number of\n\n4\n\n‘HPe-rfect Systemof Roads and Canals” turnpikes or the growing competition of cheaper canal transportation. N o r was wagon freight fast transportation. When a Conestoga wagon drawn by four horses traveled the ninety miles from New York City to Philadelphia in three days, it became known as the “flying machine.” Even though it was slow and costly, wagon traffic was heavy. In a two-and-a-half-day stage trip from Chambersburg to Pittsburgh in the fall of I 8 I 7, the Englishman Henry Bradshaw Fearon noted that his coach overtook 103 freight wagons headed for Pittsburgh. Stagecoach traffic, too, was extensive. Sharing the road with the Conestoga wagon, the stagecoach, designed primarily as a passenger vehicle, offered a much faster means of transportation than the slow-moving freight wagon. T h e advantage of speed was offset, however, by the disadvantage of a rough ride. This was even true in the case of the Concord coach, which was far from comfortable. Of a trip through Pennsylvania, George Sumner ( I 8 I 7-63) wrote: “For two days and two nights was my body exposed to the thumps of this horrid road, and when I got to Pittsburgh (after having broken down twice, and got out three times during one night and broken down rail fences to pry the coach out of the mud) my body was a perfectjelly-without one sound spot upon it, too tired to stand, too sow to sit.” Both Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) in 1808 and John Calhoun a decade later stressed canals, as well as improved roads, in their plans for internal improvements. Canals are built slowly, and in 1817, when Calhoun made his plea for a perfect system of transportation, only about IOO miles of canals had been constructed, the longest single canal being just over 27 miles in length. But in that year Governor DeWitt Clinton (I 769-1828) prodded the state of New York into starting a 364-mile canal from Albany to Buffalo, a project that would require $8,000,000, eight years, and unprecedented engineering feats. Completed in 1825, the Erie Canal was an immediate financial success. T h e canal craze was on. By 1830 a t least 10,000miles of inland waterways were pro-\n\n5\n\nAmerican Railroads jected and 1,277 miles had been built. More than 2,000 additional miles were constructed during the thirties, and in 1840 the total canal investment in the nation stood a t $125,000,000. Although in 1840 every state east of the Mississippi, with the exception of Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, and Tennessee, had canals in operation, 7 0 per cent of the total mileage was to be found in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York. Since canals were much more expensive than turnpikes, generally costing from $20,000 to $30,000 per mile, most of the total investment in them, perhaps 60 per cent, was direct state aid. T h e Panic of 1837 revealed that several states had extended their credit too far in supporting internal improvements and were on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to the major waterways, several minor types of canals were built. These included short canals designed to avoid some river obstacle, such as that a t the falls of the Ohio near Louisville; canals connecting two busy rivers, lakes, or bays, such as the Wabash and Erie in Indiana o r the Chesapeake and Delaware in the East; and anthracite tidewater canals, such as the Lehigh or Morris canals in Pennsylvania. T h e most important type, however, was that intended to draw western business to some eastern city. Nearly every coastal city from Portland to Savannah had dreams of reaching the back country by canal, but frequently these dreams were thwarted by mountains or by lack of money. Only three westward-looking canals followed the Erie pattern: the “Pennsylvania System,” the Chesapeake and Ohio, and the James River and Kanawha. T h e last two were stopped by mountains, the I 84-mile Chesapeake and Ohio at Cumberland, Maryland, and the zoo-mile James River and Kanawha at Buchanan, Virginia. T h e state of Pennsylvania eventually built its 39s-mile Main Line to the Ohio River, but only with the assistance of 174 locks and several inclined-plane railroads (near Hollidaysburg) that rose 2,200 feet above sea level. Whether canal projects brought profit or ruin to their sponsors, 6\n\n‘H Perfect System of Roads and Canals” they all succeeded in greatly reducing the costs of freight carriage. Even on the difficult Pennsylvania Main Line rates were down to 8 cents a ton-mile in 1833, as contrasted to 20 cents by wagon. O n the Erie, freight rates ranged from I .6 cents to 3.4 cents per tonmile in the thirties and forties and were down to a penny a mile by mid-century. Although the canal lineboat and the freighter took much business away from the Conestoga wagon, the stagecoach suffered less severely from the competition offered by canal packets or passenger boats. T h e packet could offer a smooth, leisurely trip, often with surprisingly good meals. Its five and a half by two foot bunks for overnight travelers were so closely spaced that Charles Dickens (I 8 I 2-70) found it best to roll directly from the floor into his lower berth. For many the novelty of canal travel soon wore off. In 1830 Albany’s five daily stage lines going westward up the Mohawk Valley often had to add extra coaches. T h e stage lines could also offer year-round service, while most canals were closed from three to five months each winter. River transportation had always been vital in the United States, with its vast distances and extensive hinterland. By the early nineteenth century, eastern and western rivers alike were crowded with a variety of “bullboats: canoes, flatboats, and keelboats. Shortly before the War of 1 8 1 2 the steamboat was added to this assortment. In 18I I the 3 7 I -ton Pittsburgh-built “New Orleans” successfully reached New Orleans, and four years later the “Enterprise” proved the feasibility of upstream travel with a round trip from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. By 182 I seventy-two boats were employed on western waters, and frequently a dozen could be seen together down in New Orleans. By 1830 the average steamboat was giving freight service faster than the canal boat and cheaper than the wagon. For the passenger, steamboat accommodations were faster and more luxurious than those found on the canal boat and both cheaper and more comfortable than those of the stagecoach. Cabin 7\n\nAmerican Railroads passage, including meals, for the 2,064-mile trip from Pittsburgh to New Orleans cost only $45 in 1839. Most Americans could find little fault with the luxuriously appointed craft and were proud when European visitors like Count Francesco Arese admitted that “the finest ones we have in Europe are much inferior to the smallest, the wretchedest ferry-boat over here.” Steamboat travel offered not only luxury but also danger. Old wrecks lined every river by mid-century, and the newspapers were filled with stories of explosions, collisions, fires, and snagged boats. Accidents on western rivers in 1853 claimed 78 boats and 454 lives. T h e optimistic traveler could take satisfaction in the claim of Niles’ Weekly Register that “with moderation and care steamboats are not so very dangerous.” River travel was less dangerous in the East, and on the Hudson River a five-year experiment with safety barges (passenger boats towed behind steamboats) ended in failure in 1830 when the barges “Lady Clinton” and “Lady Rensselaer” were offered for sale as freight towboats. But even on eastern rivers the natural factors of ice and low water could halt all navigation. Between I 8 I 8 and 1859 ice closed the Hudson at Albany an average of four months a year, and a t Pittsburgh ice, plus seasons of low water, made a comparable reduction in commerce. In the first decades of the nineteenth century many of the needs for better transportation were fulfilled as well-constructed roads, a host of new canals, and faster steamboat travel appeared. In the years after the War of 1 8 1 2 nearly every ambitious American city was the center of a radiating network of turnpikes, either planned or already built. In 1826 Boston had eighty stage lines with more than two hundred scheduled arrivals and departures each day. T h e toasts, processions, transparencies (illuminated banners), and kegs of river water from around the world that were employed to mark the opening of Governor Clinton’s Erie Canal in the autumn of 1825 initiated a series of canal celebrations which continued for years. High- and low-pressure steamboats brought prosperity to\n\n8\n\n‘HPe$ect System of Roads and Canals” Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, and St. Louis and dreams of the same to the remote upriver towns of Knoxville and Indianapolis. Wagon freight never became really cheap, and the best Concord coaches were still slow and uncomfortable. Canals were stymied by mountains and were certain to freeze over in winter. Steamboats, although they were fast and luxurious, were also dangerous. Moreover, Henry Miller Shreve (1785-185 I), veteran steamboater and inventor of the “snagboat,” which became known as “Uncle Sam’s tooth-puller,” could not always remove hazardous obstructions from river channels, even for the record shallow-draft “Orphan Boy” (169 tons, zz-inch draft). Some new form of transportation, year round in regularity, safe and cheap, overland and unlimited in route, was obviously needed. Americans in the 1820s did not have long to wait.\n\n9\n\n2\n\nFirst Rails The iron rail, flanged wheel, and puffing locomotive appeared in America by 1830.In the next twenty years the railroad brought a new dimension and added a new flavor to American transportation. The first railroads frequently helped American cities (and in turn were aided themselves) as they sought a larger share of western markets. In the first third of the nineteenth century the commercial rivalry among major eastern American cities was as intense as the competition among the various transportation facilities that served them and the nation. Already first in population by 1810,New York City increased her lead after I 8I 5 through a combination of natural geographic advantages and a series of aggressive measures pushed by an energetic citizenry. Encouraged when the British chose New York as a market for surplus British goods after the War of 18I 2 , the merchants of that city increased this trade advantage in 1817 by creating an attractive auction system for the sale of imports and by establishing dependable and regular packet service across the Atlantic. Within fifteen years the expanding foreign trade of New York City was nearly half the total foreign trade of the nation, and by I0\n\nFirst Rails 1828 the New York Custom House was collecting sufficient duties to pay the entire expenses of the federal government. In the same period, shipping interests in the city, seeing the advantage of attracting the immigrant trade, were so successful that by the thirties\n\nroughly half the newcomers arriving in America were landing at New York. Simultaneously, the New Yorkers succeeded in securing their full share of the nation’s domestic trade by developing extensive coastal commerce along the Atlantic and by catering to western trade after the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. T h e immediate success of Governor Clinton’s favorite canal stirred rival cities from their lethargy. In the decade after 182j several cities (Philadelphia with a canal, Boston and Charleston with railroads, and Baltimore with both) sought western trade. Philadelphia started first. Alarmed by the drop (within a generation) from first city to fourth in the volume of foreign trade, the city fathers vigorously supported the Pennsylvania state project to reach Pittsburgh by a combined canal and rail route. T h e jgs-mile Main Line from Philadelphia to the Ohio was built between 1826 and 1834 at a cost nearly twice that of the Erie and across mountains nearly four times as high as those along the lower New York route. T h e project never prospered. In the first decade of its operation the revenues did little more than meet the current operating expenses of the system. T h e lack of success by the merchants of Philadelphia lay in their failure to appreciate the height of P e m sylvania mountains and the relative merits of a new form of transportation, the railroad. To the south, Baltimore was somewhat more successful in her bid for western trade. This small town of colonial times had grown more rapidly between I 790 and 1820 than any other major American city. Ahead of Boston and Charleston and third in population by 1800, Baltimore boasted 35,000 people in 1810and 63,000 in 1820. Her prosperity in the first two decades of the century was aided by the construction of the Cumberland Road and by the conI1\n\nAmerican Railroads centration of Baltimore merchants on both Susquehanna Valley trade and the coastal commerce built up by fast “clipper” schooners. Well aware of their own commercial progress, the citizens of Baltimore could generously agree with their local editor, Hezekiah Niles (1777-1839), when he wrote of New York City in 1821: “This [city] is now the second commercial city in the world; a little while and it will probably be thefil-st, by means of its canals and the trade of the lakes.” Baltimore and Maryland were a little slower than Philadelphia and Pennsylvania in meeting the challenge of New York‘s canals, but when they did move, they made a dual attack. Both the state of Maryland and the city of Baltimore were sanguine about the success of their canal and railroad projects, since they could claim a shorter route to the Ohio, by a margin of two hundred miles, than either of the rival northern cities. At Georgetown on July 4, 1828, John Quincy Adams (1767I 848) wielded a ribbon-bedecked spade to start the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; forty miles away, near Baltimore, the aged Charles Carroll (1737-1832) was laying the first stone for the Baltimore & Ohio Rail Road. T h e Baltimore people soon realized that the canal would favor the new national capital far more than their own city and therefore transferred their full allegiance to the railroad. T h e plump and pleasant president of the new. railroad, merchant-banker Philip E. Thomas ( I 776-1861), pushed construction with vigor, and by May 1830, passengers could enjoy a thirteen-mile trip by horse-drawn car out to Ellicott’s Mills, Maryland. Steam power came to the Baltimore & Ohio later that summer when Peter Cooper (1791-1883), glue-maker from New York City and part-time inventor who had just taken a flier in Baltimore real estate, built the experimental locomotive “Tom Thumb.” T h e usefulness of the little engine was limited, however, and except for its famous race with a horse and occasional trips for the benefit of distinguished guests, it stood idle. T h e railroad used horse-drawn I2\n\nFirst Rails cars until extensive trials in the summer of 183 I proved the threeand-one-half-con “York” to be a fully practical and serviceable locomotive. By the time of his retirement in 1836, Thomas had extended the railroad to Harper’s Ferry and had built a 37-mile branch line to Washington. The railroad now had gross revenues of over $260,000 yearly and claimed 7 locomotives, 1,078 “burthern,” or freight cars, and 44 passenger cars. T h e new president, Louis McLane ( I 786-1 857), former Jacksonian cabinet member, pushed the B.&O. on to Cumberland by 1842, but further extension to the west was slowed by high mountains and opposition from both Virginia and Pennsylvania. Not until Christmas Eve, 1852, was the last spike driven in the line which reached the Ohio River at U k e l i n g , Virginia. By this time the merchants in New York City were less inclined to worry about their rivals in Maryland. In the South, Charleston, a city whose foreign trade had gone into decline, bid for a greater share of the inland trade by building a railroad. T h e merchants of the city, hoping to secure the trade of a rich cotton-growing area in their own state and in Georgia, projected a railway to Hamburg, South Carolina, just across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia. As the first rails were being laid out of Charleston by the South Carolina Canal and RailRoad Company, the new chief engineer, Horatio Allen ( I 802-90) of New York, persuaded the directors to use steam power on the line. “There is no reason to expect any material improvement in the breed of horses in the future,” argued Allen, “while, in my judgment, the man is not living who knows what the breed of locomotives is to place a t command.” O n Christmas Day, 1830, the “Best Friend of Charleston,” constructed for $4,000-the first locomotive built for sale in the United States-carried 141 passengers on the first scheduled steam-railroad train run in America. T h e entire 136-mile route to Hamburg was completed by October 1833, to become the longest continuous railroad in the world. In later years\n\n‘3\n\nAmerican Railroads South Carolina built additional mileage more slowly, for the total remained at I 36 miles in I 840 and had only doubled by I 850. In New England, Boston was worried about the commercial success of New York. Not only did the Erie Canal threaten to capture Boston’s trade with western Massachusetts, but much business in the central section of the state was being attracted by New Haven, Hartford, and Providence. In their quest for a commercial revival, the Boston merchants wisely rejected the idea of more canals-waterways which, after all, were expensive to build and which, because of winter ice, were at best open only two-thirds of the year. Bostonians noted the success of the Granite Railway, a two-mile broad-gauge tramway built at Quincy by Gridley Bryant (1789-1867) in 1826 to transport granite for the Bunker Hill monument, and the following year (May 1827) they eagerly paid admission to see the display of English locomotives at the nation’s first Railway Exhibition. After efforts to obtain state financial support for a western railroad from Boston to Albany failed, three short, privately financed lines were chartered in 1830-31. To the north the Boston and Lowell linked two important cities. To the south the Boston and Providence provided a shortcut over a longer water route. T h e third line, the Boston and Worcester, was seeking the western trade. All three lines were in operation by 1835 and they were to form the nucleus of the New England rail system. Even before the completion of the Boston and Worcester, its president, Nathan Hale ( I 784-1 863), long-time editor of the Boston Daily Advertiser and nephew of the Revolutionary War patriot, was urging that the rail line be continued to the west. T h e Western Railroad, to run the I 50 miles from Worcester, via Springfield and Pittsfield, to Albany, was chartered in I 83 3, and by the end of I 835 all of its stock had been sold, most of it in Boston. T h e $2,000,000 in private money was admittedly inadequate for the ambitious project, and the Commonwealth soon subscribed $I ,ooo,ooo in stock and by 1841 had lent an additional $4,000,000 to the line.\n\nFif-stRails T h e road was completed to Springfield by 1839 and in the next two years was pushed through the rugged Berkshires to the Hudson River and Albany. T h e city fathers of both Boston and Albany made the first round trip on the line, the Boston delegation returning home on December 28, 1841, with a barrel of Rochester flour, which was used to bake bread for that evening’s celebration. Boston now possessed an all-rail connection with the west and the Erie Canal, but she never obtained any major portion of the traffic destined for New York City via the Hudson River. After all, the Western Railroad, to use the language of Charles F. Adams, Jr. (1835-1915), was built upon “the fallacy that steam could run up hill cheaper than water could run down.” But in completing this early transectional railroad (later consolidated as the Boston and Albany), Boston had built a line noted for its financial sobriety and technical excellence. Few railroads were projected or built without some opposition, often a considerable opposition, from a variety of timid citizens, vested interests, tavern keepers, turnpike and bridge companies, stagecoach lines, and canals. T h e projected rail route from Boston to Albany was opposed by a Boston editor who thought the project not only impracticable but also “as useless as a railroad to the moon.” Even when completed the railroad frequently had to overcome the opposition of state governments loyal to their canals. In New York railroads running parallel to the Erie Canal had to pay tolls equal to those of the canal, and in Ohio and Pennsylvania special taxes were levied against rail traffic which competed directly with canal business. In Ohio a school board placed a moral judgment on rail lines, calling them “a device of Satan to lead immortal souls to hell.” When members of the Massachusetts legislature chartered the state’s first railroad, they were described by turnpike interests as “cruel turnpike killers and despisers of horseflesh.” T h e wealthy Philadelphia merchant Samuel Breck complained that “if one could stop when one wanted, and if one were\n\nAmerican Railroads not locked up in a box with 50 or 60 tobacco-chewers; and the engine and fire did not burn holes in one’s clothes . . . and the smell of the smoke, of the oil, and of the chimney did not poison one . . . and [one] were not in danger of being blown sky-high or knocked off the rails-it would be the perfection of travelling.” For most Americans, however, the decade of the thirties was an era of railroad enthusiasm and noisy railroad fever. Within half a dozen years after the Baltimore & Ohio began operations, some two hundred lines had been chartered, taking the savings of thousands of investors, many of whom had never seen a railroad track or a steam locomotive. Those with pennies instead of dollars joined the rail craze by purchasing glassware, china, sheet music, or wallpaper decorated with brilliant pictures of railroad cars and steaming locomotives. T h e young nation dreamed and planned ambitious rail lines that were to cross unsettled territory, span rivers, and reach distant cities. Early in 1830 the two sons of Colonel John Stevens-Robert Livingston Stevens (1787-1856) and Edwin A. Stevens (17951868)-obtained a charter from the New Jersey legislature for the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company. Written into the charter was a “monopoly” clause which gave the Stevens boys exclusive rail-transportation rights between New York City and Philadelphia. This advantage assured a rapid subscription to the one-million-dollar stock issue, and the road was completed across the state by I 833. T h e English-built locomotive “John Bull” provided a seven-hour passenger service between the two cities for a three-dollar fare. Connecting service westward from Philadelphia to the system of state canals was available in I 834 on the state-owned Philadelphia and Columbia. Four years later a main line to Baltimore was opened with the completion of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. T h e first railroad in New York State was conceived when English-born George William Featherstonhaugh ( I 780-1 866) ob16\n\n“The First Railway Train” by E. L.

This seventeen-mile line between Albany and Schenectady would permit canal-packet passengers to avoid the day-long forty-mile ride through the many locks in the terminal section of the Erie. T h e road was built in 1830-31 by John B. Jervis (1795-1885), recently of the Delaware and Hudson Canal and Railroad Company. Service began in August, 183I , with the company’s first locomotive impudently named the “DeWitt Clinton.” Less than six months later Niles’ WeeklyRegister reported that twenty-five different New York railroads (with capital structures amounting to $41,ooo,ooo) were applying for incorporation before the state legislature. T h e railroad industry expanded rapidly during the thirties as nearly every state laid rails. Of the twenty-six states in 1840, only four (Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Vermont) had not completed their first mile of track. Most of the lines were built to serve coastal cities in the eastern states, for only a twelfth of the 3,000 miles of road lay west of the Appalachians. T h e New England and Middle Atlantic states accounted for more than 60 per cent of the mileage in 1840, with Pennsylvania first in the nation in mileage (754), New York second (374), and Massachusetts third (301). Southern states could claim I , 10s miles of road in I 840, while the Old Northwest, though dozens of lines were projected there, completed only I 3 3 miles in the thirties. T h e Panic of I 837 and the depression which followed were disastrous for the rail projects of some states, especially Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, but for most of the nation n o immediate slackening of construction was apparent, since about half the decade’s new lines were built in the last three years-1838, 1839, and 1840. While additional canal construction was carried on during the thirties, it never quite matched railroad-building, and thus in 1840 the two facilities were nearly equal in mileage. T h e western states pushed their canal projects vigorously during the decade and accounted for nearly a third of the nation’s 3,300 miles of canals, with ‘9\n\nAmerican Railroads Ohio (74.4 miles) being second only to Pennsylvania. Although American railroads were generally following English technique and experience during the thirties, the United States easily outstripped total European rail construction during the decade by a margin of 3,000miles of new road in America to only 1,800miles in Europe. Although western Europe possessed the advantages of better engineering, more highly developed metal-working techniques, and easier financing, the United States more than balanced these with the assets of a greater need for improved transport, a relative freedom from long-entrenched customs, prejudices, and monopolies, and cheaper land for railroad right of way. America had about $ ~ ~ , 0 0 0 , 0 0invested 0 in her rail network in 1840, which was far less money than the European expenditure for a much smaller system. In 1840 the American railroad system was a thin, broken network stretching along the Atlantic coast from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to the Carolinas. If a traveler wanted to go from Boston to Georgia, he could go by rail to Stonington, Connecticut; by steamer to New York City and across to Jersey; by rail to Washington, via Camden, Philadelphia, and Baltimore; and by steamer forty miles down the Potomac to rail service which would get him to Wilmington, North Carolina. After a stage trip through South Carolina to Charleston, he could continue by train on the South Carolina Railroad to the end of the track a t Hamburg, across the river from Augusta, Georgia. Technical innovations and improvements occupied the minds of all the early railroad-builders. T h e pages of the first important railroad periodical, the American Railroad 30~7-nal,founded by D. Kimball Minor in 183I, were filled with technical and engineering articles throughout the thirties and forties. Railroad companies quickly demonstrated the necessity of their controlling the traffic on the lines they built. Thus, unlike the canal and turnpike companies, the railroads soon universally owned and operated all 20\n\nFirst Rails the rolling stock and motive power on the road. As “common carriers,” they were expected to accept for shipment anything within reason. Some of the first railroad improvements were focused on the roadbed. Nearly all of the early railways had built their track with long iron straps, or bars, fastened to wooden rails, which, in turn, were secured to large blocks of granite or other stone. T h e ironstrap rails, although twenty to twenty-five feet in length, had a tendency to work loose and curl up under the weight of trains to form “snakeheads,” which often broke through the floor of a passing coach. T h e strap rails could be increased in thickness, but the real solution to the problem appeared when Robert L. Stevens, president and engineer of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, designed the T-rail. Stevens carved his first model rail out of wood while in England on a locomotive buying trip, had the rails made in Wales, and was installing them as original track on his New Jersey line in 183I. T h e new type of rail was not only strong but its flat bottom (requiring no rail chair as was common in England) could be spiked directly to the block or tie. With the increasing weight of locomotives and rail traffic, the T-rail soon became standard equipment on all first-class lines. T h e state of New York required the new type rail on all railroads after I 847. O n the branch line or the cheaply constructed road, strap-iron rails, frequently second hand, remained a common sight until the Civil War. T h e heavy stone or granite blocks also proved unsatisfactory, both because of their susceptibility to frost-heaving and also because the track proved so unresilient as to be hard on the rolling stock. Wooden crossties imbedded in a gravel roadbed were found to h r nish the most satisfactory type of rail construction. Railroad managers soon realized that even the best-laid original track could not be considered permanent and that the costs of maintaining track and roadbed would he continuous. Early American railroad lines presented a great variety in 21\n\nI\n\ni\n\nAmerican Railroads gauge. Many of the first roads, since they used English-built engines, naturally built to the English gauge of 4 feet 8% inches, a figure long customary to English wagons. This was the most common gauge in New England and in the North, although much variation was to be found in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In New York a broad the Erie Railroad deliberately-and unwisely-used gauge of 6 feet to prevent loss of traffic to other lines. This variation proved costly, and eventually the Erie shifted to the standard gauge. In most of the southern states the 5-foot gauge was common, though certainly not universal. As early as 1834 the American Rail~oadJoumalwas stressing the necessity of uniformity in gauge, but this ideal was not to be achieved on a truly national basis for half a century. A more rapid development of uniformity was achieved in motive power. While horses, mules, stationary engines, and even sails and horse-operated treadmills were tried on the early lines, the steam locomotive soon relegated the horse to a reserve and substitute status. Within a few years most railroad horses were back on the farm. Some of the first American-built engines were not entirely satisfactory. When Philadelphia jewelry manufacturer Matthias Baldwin (1795-1866) built his first full-size locomotive, “Old Ironsides: for the newly incorporated Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad, the engine averaged only a mile an hour in its first trials. However, experimentation soon pushed the speed of Baldwin’s locomotive up to twenty-eight miles per hour. One of the most important improvements was made by John B. Jervis while he was still chief engineer on the Mohawk and Hudson. Dissatisfied with the rigid front axle and poor turning characteristics of the heavy English engines, Jervis, with some advice from Horatio Allen, designed the first swivel, or “bogie,” wheels, which were mounted in a truck under the front of the locomotive. Jervis’ new locomotive, the “Experiment,” built in 1832 by the West Point Foundry, negotiated all curves with ease and soon proved capable\n\nF i m Rails of speeds approaching a mile a minute. T h e equalizing beam, inof Philadelphia in 1839, was vented by Joseph Harrison (1810-74) also important because it permitted equal pressure by each drive wheel, even on rough or uneven track. Even earlier, however, in 1836, Henry R. Campbell (1781-1844) of the same city had designed an eight-wheeled engine (bogie truck plus four drivers) which, as the American-type locomotive, was to dominate American locomotive styling for half a century. James Brooks built the first engine of this type in 1837. In the thirties the locomotive acquired many of the features which made its silhouette distinctive. Robert Stevens and his top mechanic, Isaac Dripps (I 810-92), probably invented the first “pilot,” or cowcatcher, for the locomotives on the Camden and Amboy. When early trains collided with a cow, the engine often landed in a ditch or in the repair shop, but after Isaac Dripps perfected the cowcatcher, the railroad company had to pay for the cow. In South Carolina Horatio Allen initiated the first train travel at night when he built a fire of pine knots in sand on a small flatcar pushed ahead of a Charleston and Hamburg locomotive. Night trips on the railroad lines of the thirties were very infrequent, and thus the conventional headlight, burning kerosene in front of tin reflectors, became common only in the forties. T h e sandbox (to provide improved wheel traction) first appeared in Pennsylvania in 1836 when a great plague of grasshoppers visited the state and threatened to bring all train movements to a halt. Later that same year, George W Whistler ( I 800-49), former army lieutenant, surveyor of the Baltimore & Ohio, and husband of the lady portrayed in “Whistler’s Mother,” built the locomotive “Susquehanna:’ which boasted the first steam-locomotive whistle in America. First used for signaling the brakeman and the train crew and for general warnings to a more pedestrian traffic, in later years the whistle became a sort of occupational signature for the engineer who was skillful with the whistle cord. T h e locomotive cab was first tried on\n\nAmerican Railroads Massachusetts lines as they were extended into New Hampshire. Canvas (and, later, wooden) cabs kept the engine crews from freezing to death in the bitter New England winters. In the forties American rail construction easily kept pace with technical advances. T h e network of 3,000 miles of line in 1840 had tripled to nearly 9,000 miles of line in 1850, with every state east of the ll/lississippi claiming at least some mileage. Although railroads were being built in all sections of the East, the New England and Middle Atlantic states still had a clear lead at mid-century with more than 5,300 miles of railroad tracks, or nearly 60 percent of the national figure. T h e rapid northeastern rail expansion was most noticeable in New England, where the forties saw a fivefold increase in mileage. In 18j o the railroad map of New England looked fairly complete, with three states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire) already having mileage equal to roughly half of what they would have one hundred years later. Boston was the hub of the New England system, with lines radiating inland in every direction. A second major Massachusetts line, projected across the northern part of the state toward Troy, on the Hudson, was twothirds completed by 1850. T h e expansion of the New England network could probably be traced to the fact that in the early thirties Massachusetts and Boston had chosen the railroad as the transportation of the future while rival states and cities to the south were still flirting with the canal. If some New Englanders complained in the forties that their region was the only one overbuilt with railroads, a t least it resulted in New England’s becoming the mother of railroading and railroad men for half a century. In the same decade the railroads of New York and Pennsylvania also grew. In New York the connecting road west of the Mohawk and Hudson, the 78-mile Utica and Schenectady, was so prosperous that in 1850 the stockholders of the line rewarded their presi-\n\n26\n\nFirst Rails dent, Erastus Corning (1794-1872), with a $6,000 service of plate. This same Erastus Corning, nail-maker and long-time mayor of Albany, was to lead in the 1853 creation of the New York Central Railroad, a consolidation of the ten little railroads strung along the Mohawk Valley and the Erie Canal. In 18j o two rival roads on the easrern side of the Hudson, the New York and Hudson and the New York and Harlem, had nearly completed their lines upriver to Albany. And in the state’s southern tier of counties, the president of the New York and Erie Railroad, Benjamin Loder (1801-76), was driving his Irish and German construction crews to complete, by 1851, his 483-mile route to Dunkirk on Lake Erie. With such a variety of big rail-construction projects, it was easy for New York to claim first place (1,361 miles) among the states in 1850. Pennsylvania was a strong second in mileage at mid-century. T h e major new line in Pennsylvania in the forties was the Pennsylvania Railroad, incorporated by Philadelphia businessmen in April 1846. Realizing the futility of depending upon the state canal system and seeing the commercial menace of the Erie Railroad taking shape to the north and the Baltimore & Ohio to the south, the merchants of Philadelphia decided to build a line to Pittsburgh. Under the strong, sure guidance of their chief engineer, John Edgar Thomson (I 808-74), they completed, by I 850, a I 3 7-mile road west from Harrisburg to connect with the state-owned inclined-plane railroad near Hollidaysburg. Much new mileage was constructed in southern and western states. Every southern state added railroads in the forties, but Georgia far outstripped her neighbors, building 4j o miles during the decade to achieve a position of railroad leadership in the Southeast that she was to maintain for a century. By 1850 Atlanta was the center of a growing network of lines. To the east the wellestablished Georgia Railroad, built by John Edgar Thomson before he returned to Pennsylvania, gave service to Augusta; to the 27\n\nAmerican Raih-oads southeast the Macon and Western Railroad and the Central Railroad reached the coast a t Savannah; and to the northeast the 138mile state-built Western and Atlantic had nearly reached Chattanooga. Most of the 1,276 miles of the line in the Old Northwest in 1850 was located in Ohio (575 miles) and Michigan (342 miles). In Ohio a broken complex of lines stretched southward from Cleveland and Sandusky on Lake Erie to Columbus and Dayton and then on to Cincinnati on the Ohio River. All the mileage in Michigan was in the southern part of the state, with the major line, the Michigan Central, once a state-owned line but now owned by men from Boston, connecting Detroit and Lake Michigan. T h e 9,000-mile national rail network of 1850 had cost perhaps $3 IO,OOO,OOO to construct, nearly twice the $160,000,000 sum invested in the 3,700 miles of canals at mid-century. T h e national average cost of railroad construction was $34,000 per mile, but there was a great variance in this figure in the several sections of the country. In New England, where the terrain was often rugged and the traffic fairly heavy, railroads had cost an average of $39,000 per mile, with the solidly built Boston and Lowell requiring $71,000 per mile, the Western Railroad costing $50,000, and the shorter lines, the Old Colony and the Fitchburg, costing only $25,000 and $30,000, respectively. In the Middle Atlantic states high construction costs (averaging $46,000 per mile) were caused as frequently by the unevenness of the financial management as by the roughness of the terrain. Upon completion in 1851 the Erie was valued at $43,000 per mile, exclusive of equipment. Erastus Corning’s Utica and Schenectady was listed at $53,000 per mile in the same year and the Baltimore & Ohio at even rnore-$54,000 per mile. In southern and western states, where the terrain was fairly even and where the potential traffic volume often permitted a lighter type of construction, the average cost per mile was no 28\n\nFirst Rails more than $ 2 I ,000, with the well-built Georgia Railroad costing only $17,000 a mile. Over 50 per cent of the more than $300,000,000 invested in American railroads in 1850 was represented by capital stock, the remainder being in bonds. Since their required capital investments were always large and carried maximum risk, nearly all railroads organized as corporations, securing their charters from the state legislatures. These charters frequently included such liberal privileges as monopoly provisions (as in the case of the Camden and Amboy), partial or temporary exemption from state taxation, lottery or banking rights (notably the lines in Georgia), and, of course, sweeping privileges of eminent domain. T h e privilege of eminent domain not only permitted a railroad real freedom in the selection of its route, but also tended to keep its right-of-way costs low (unlike in England, where the railways had n o such privilege). Since several state governments had, in earlier years, sponsored and built canals, it was natural that some of the first railroads were also state projects. In Pennsylvania two of the earliest lines in the state, the Portage Railroad and the Philadelphia and Columbia, were constructed with state money, as was the strategically located Western and Atlantic in Georgia. Three western states, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, also experimented, with very indifferent success, with public construction. Infinitely more important than state construction was state financial assistance to privately owned lines. Sometimes, especially in the case of Virginia, this aid was granted through the purchase of capital stock, but normally it was in the form of loans. State financial aid to railways had already reached nearly $40,000,000by 1838, and it was to increase still more by mid-century. T h e Western Railroad in Massachusetts, the Erie in New York, the Baltimore 8i Ohio in Maryland, and most of the railroads in Virginia were among the rail recipients of state assistance. There was little\n\nAmerican Railroads municipal aid in the thirties and forties, but for a few lines it was vital. Federal aid, prior to the 1850 land grant to the Illinois Central-Mobile and Ohio project, consisted of a number of route surveys by army engineers and a reduction in the tariff on imported railroad iron in the years from 1830 to 1843. Most of the money for the early railroads came from private investors. Farmers and tradesmen living along the route of the proposed railroad, merchants, professional men, and businessmen living in the terminal cities-all were persuaded to subscribe to capital stock or buy bonds. T h e hope of improved land values, more profitable markets, or a general rise in prosperity was frequently in the mind of the investor, as was the thought that the investment itself might be a good one. Too often the early enthusiasm created in mass meetings or railroad conventions melted away when the subscription books were opened. Press and pulpit, pamphleteer and orator often were called upon to make the filled and signed subscription book a reality. T h e selling job was easier in those large eastern seaports (or important trading centers of the interior) where the railroad was becoming a major weapon in the competitive municipal mercantilism of the period. In the years before I 850 only minor portions of the total rail investment came from eastern banks or the money markets of Europe. Passenger traffic and the revenue it brought in were much more important to the railroads of a century ago than they are today. T h e novelty of travel by rail plus the appeal of rocketing downgrade at perhaps 2 0 miles per hour helped furnish the first substantial financial returns for many new lines. Some of these roads, such as the Utica and Schenectady in 1836, were used exclusively for passenger business in the first weeks and months. In its fourth year of operation (1833-34) the Baltimore & Ohio carried 95,000 passengers with a revenue amounting to well over 40 per cent of the total for the year. A few lines, like the Syracuse and Utica, where the Erie Canal took the cream of the freight traffic, remained pri-\n\nFirst Rails marily passenger roads until mid-century. For the typical railroad, however, passenger traffic probably produced between a fourth and a third of the total revenue, a ratio which was common until after the Civil War. Early railroad passenger fares were frequently high, but by the late forties competition had reduced them to perhaps 2.5 to 3.5 cents per mile in New England and in the Middle Atlantic States and no more than 4 to 5 cents in the rest of the nation. T h e first railroad passenger cars slavishly followed the stagecoach in design, but when Andrew Jackson (I 767-1 845) became the first president to travel by train, on the Baltimore & Ohio in 1833, the first corridor-type coaches had appeared. Ross Winans (1796-1877) came to Baltimore in 1828 to sell horses to the new B.&O. but stayed on to become an engineer on the line, inventing the long coach with trucks at either end of the car and the famous “camel-back” locomotive. Fanny Kemble ( I 809-93), the English actress, left this vivid description of a coach used on her American tour: “The windows . . . form the walls on each side of the carriage, which looks like a long greenhouse upon wheels; the seats, which each contain two persons (a pretty tight fit, too), are placed down the whole length of the vehicle, one behind the other, leaving a species of aisle in the middle for the uneasy (a large portion of the traveling community here) to fidget up and down, for the tobaccochewers to spit in, and for a whole tribe of itinerant fruit and cakesellers to rush through, distributing their wares a t every place where the train stops.’’ Miss Kemble may well have ridden in the Erie cars, with their water boys-youngsters who passed through the train with a long-spout can and a couple of glasses, complete with germs, for the benefit of thirsty travelers. Coach travel was rarely comfortable. T h e cars were inadequately heated in winter and hot in summer. T h e menace of sparks kept the windows shut, although the intrepid Davy Crockett (1786-1836) insisted on opening one, claiming that “I can only 5’\n\nAmerican Rail?-oads judge of the speed by putting my head out to spit, which I did, and overtook it so quick, that it hit me smack in the face.” Crude sleeping cars were introduced, with indifferent success, on several eastern roads in the thirties and forties, and the Camden and Amboy offered de luxe service in 1840 when it outfitted a pair of coaches with rocking chairs. T h e speed of the Camden and Amboy and other eastern trains appealed to the Post Office Department, and by 1834 Postmaster General William T Barry (1785-1835) had contracted with several of them to help carry the “Great Eastern Mail.” By the end of the decade William F. Harnden (I8rz-4j) and Alvin Adams ( I 804-77) were renting space in baggage cars for their railway-express business. In mid-century the freight business of American railroads was less exciting than the passenger traffic but economically more important. Even the first railroad freight rates were substantially lower than those of the wagon companies. In 1832 the American Railroad @crxal reported that the proprietor of the mills a t Ellicott’s Mills, thirteen miles out of Baltimore, was receiving good freight service from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad for only a fourth of his former transportation costs. In the following year the ton-mile rate on the new Boston and Worcester line in Massachusetts was only a third of the wagon or turnpike charges. Especially where traffic was heavy or distances great, the superiority of the railroad over wagon and turnpike freighting was obvious. T h e railroad was slower in showing its supremacy, in freight carriage, over the canal as few rail lines could come close to canal transportation rates, especially for heavy, bulky goods. In 1853, when the ton-mile rate on the Erie and the Ohio canals was averaging just over a penny, the comparable rates on the New York Central, the Erie, and the Pennsylvania railroads ranged from z.4 cents to 3.5 cents. For the less efficient or the poorly located canal, defeat by the railroad came more quickly. While the Erie Canal was still expanding its business in the fifties, its southern rival, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal, ceased important operations\n\nFif-stRails shortly after the Pennsylvania Railroad reached Pittsburgh in 1852. Interruptions in service caused by winter ice, too much water, or too little water plagued all the canals. As early as r 83 I Niles’ WeeklyRegistel- reported that while both the Erie and the Delaware and Hudson canals had been closed for five months during the year, operations on the newly opened Baltimore & Ohio Railroad had been stopped but a single day. N o r could the canals ever successfully compete in the building of short lines or in furnishing service directly to the factory or mill of the shipper. T h e railroad offered shippers tremendous advantages in speed. In 1852 rail shipments from Cincinnati to New York City took from six to eight days, about a third of the time required for service via the canals, Lake Erie, and the Hudson River. These several advantages resulted in heavy rail traffic of such freight as livestock, packing-house products, and general merchandise by the early fifties. T h e Erie Railroad was shipping huge quantities of milk, dairy products, and berries from the lower tier of counties in New York to New York City long before the completion of the line in I 85 I . In the generation between the Treaty of Ghent and 1850 Americans had solved the problem of moving people and goods over the growing distances of their nation both cheaply and quickly in a variety of ways. Turnpike, wagon, and Concord stage had given way to canal, lineboat, and packet, to be supplemented, in turn, by stern-wheeler and side-wheeler on almost every river in the country. Before the typical turnpike had started to return its original investment-almost before the memory of the toasts and illuminated banners used to celebrate the opening of the Erie Canal had faded and long before the first federal safety regulation for river steamboats (1838)-another challenger appeared in the form of the flanged wheel, iron rail, and puffing locomotive. Perhaps the really significant theme in the early transportation history of this country was the tendency of each new type or phase of transportation to be so quickly challenged and largely supplanted by the next succeeding type or phase that no single form of transpor-\n\n33\n\nAmerican Railroads tation had a decent opportunity to grow. Fortunately for the railroad, this trend was halted by the middle of the nineteenth century. By then the railroad had achieved a position of dominance that it was to retain until early in the twentieth century. T h e dream of Oliver Evans concerning practical rail transportation had clearly become a fact by 18jo. Of course many improvements were still unknown to the American railways then; steel rail, extensive federal land grants, the automatic air brake, the adoption of standard-gauge track and standard time were all to be developed in future decades. Nevertheless, the American railroad of I 8j o already had twenty years of growth behind it and was sure of its future in an expanding American economy.\n\n34\n\n3 Early Maturity: Expansion and War The decade just before the Civil War was one of the most dynamic periods in the history of American railroads. In 1850 a broken skein of short lines stretched from Maine to Georgia, and a few stray strings of rail connected the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. In the fifties the discovery of gold in California, the lure of the trans-Pacific trade, and the new land-grant policy of the national government combined to push rail construction at a rapid rate. As a result a shift soon took place in the prevailing traffic patterns from north-south (following the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers) to east-west (following newly built rail lines). T h e railroads shared fully in the optimism, expansion, and prosperity so typical of the decade. By 1860 a railway network of over 30,000 miles served all the states east of the Mississippi quite adequately, and few locations of substantial population in the eastern third of the nation were far removed from the sound of the locomotive whistle. T h e decade following 1850 was a time of many railroad “firsts.” New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore all achieved their first rail connections with the west as the Erie, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore & Ohio railroads, respectively, reached Dunkirk, Pittsburgh, and Wheeling in 1851 and 1852. T h e first telegraphic control of\n\nAmerican Railroads trains and the first locomotive used west of the Mississippi came in the same years. In 1856 the first railroad was opened in California, from Sacramento to Folsom; the first railroad bridge spanned the Mississippi; and the first railroad over seven hundred miles in length, the Illinois Central, was completed. And in 1860, Chicago, now served by eleven different railroads, had become America’s leading, if not first, railroad center. Railroads were the major “Big Business” on the American scene in mid-century. As the rail network grew from 9,000 to more than 30,000 miles in the decade, the total investment in the industry also more than tripled-from $300,000,000 to $1, I 50,000,000 in 1860. Few other institutions in the country did business on so vast a scale or financed themselves in such a variety of ways. Few other concerns in the nation employed such numbers of men so varied in skill. T h e energy of the railroad-builders was such that by the middle fifties the United States, with no more than 5 per cent of the total world population, had nearly as much rail mileage as the rest of the world. But the rate of rail construction in the pre-Civil War decade was quite uneven. In New England, where the rail promoters had almost overextended themselves in the forties, new construction was the slowest. To the west and south the amount and rate of construction increased. In New England the mileage increased in the decade by not quite 50 per cent, in the Middle Atlantic states it doubled, south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers the rail network more than quadrupled in mileage, and in the trunk-line region of the Old Northwest the increase was roughly eightfold. T h e most intense construction was centered in the three states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. As much new rail was laid in Illinois in a single year, 1856, as had existed in the five states of the Old Northwest in 1850. In New England well over half the new construction of the fifties was located in the three northern states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. T h e major new line completed through the\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War three states in the decade was the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad, a line built to connect Portland, Maine, with Montreal, 300 miles to the northwest. T h e man who dreamed of the railroadand later built it-was John Alfred Poor (1808-71) a 250-pound Yankee from Maine. Poor’s younger brother, Henry Varnum Poor ( I 8 I 2-1 905),was the major spokesman for American railroads in the nineteenth century, first as long-time editor of the American RailroadJoumal and later as publisher of the Manuaal of the Railroads of the United States. T h e Atlantic and St. Lawrence became a reality only after John Poor had made a dramatic dash from Portland to Montreal through a raging blizzard to convince the Montreal Board of Trade that his route was preferable to one terminating in Boston. T h e 292-mile line was completed in 1853 and was built, not to the standard gauge common in New England, but to the broad Canadian gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. Within a short time the road was leased to the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, a line which by 1861 had reached the borders of Michigan via the shores of Lake Ontario and Toronto. Farther south, four east-west main trunk lines were completed early in the fifties, two ending at Lake Erie and two reaching the Ohio River. T h e oldest of the routes to Lake Erie was the string of ten short lines paralleling the Erie Canal. These roads had been giving through service, of a sort, between Albany and Buffalo since the early forties. By 1853 they boasted a combined total of 542 miles of line, 150 woodburning locomotives, 1,700 freight cars, I 87 first-class passenger coaches, and an advertised fourteen-hour passenger-train schedule between Albany and Buffalo that was rarely adhered to. T h e consolidation of the ten lines was completed in the summer of 1853,with the new company, the New York Central Railroad, boasting a sensational capitalization of $ 2 3,000,000. Erastus Corning, iron manufacturer of Albany, was the new president. As executive head of the Utica and Schenectady for twenty years, he had never taken a cent in salary, asking only 37\n\nAmerican Railroads for the privilege of supplying the railroad with all its needs in iron, steel, and rails, and the same profitable arrangement remained in effect with the New York Central until 1856,a t which time a committee of stockholders decided that their company was too big for that sort of thing. Corning continued as president of the prosperous road until 1864,by which time the New York Central had caught the eye of its future leading man, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt (I 794-1877). In 1851, as the presidents of the ten little railroads were only beginning to think of consolidation, a second through line to the west, the Erie Railroad, was completed. Its president, Benjamin Loder, planned a record-breaking celebration to mark the completion of his line, at that time the longest railroad in the country. The two special trains which made the trip from Piermont to Dunkirk on May 14and I 5 , 185I , carried 298 invited and assorted statesmen, including President Millard Fillmore, (1800-74), four members of his cabinet, and a number of presidential hopefuls, such as former Governor William H. Seward (1801-72),Stephen A. Douglas (1813-61),and Secretary of State Daniel Webster (1782-1852). At his own request the Secretary rode in a rocking chair securely fastened on an open flat car. Bundled up in a steamer rug, with a bottle of Medford rum for company, Webster said he wanted to miss none of the scenery. The route-long celebration included a number of speeches by Daniel, a parade (with nine thousand militia in dress attire), a seven-hour banquet at the overnight stop a t Elmira, and a final feast at Dunkirk, where a threehundred-foot table served up a variety of food and drink to the now groggy multitude. The new line had several years of fairly sober management before the shadow of Daniel Drew (17971879)fell across its path. In the early fifties Charles Minot (181066)was its able superintendent. Taking advantage of a parallel telegraph line set up earlier by Ezra Cornell (1807-74), Minot, on\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War September 2 2 , 1851, used the telegraph for the first time to dispatch trains, a practice soon to be adopted by all the railroads. Two other lines completed their original routes to the west in reaching the Ohio River late in 1852. In his first year as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, John Edgar Thomson saw the completion of the road from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh on December 10, 1852. For two years the railroad used the inclined planes of the Allegheny Portage Railroad, but by 1855 a tunnel and Horseshoe Curve near Altoona made possible the exclusive use of locomotive-drawn trains. Farther down the Ohio the route from Baltimore to Wheeling was completed with the driving of the last spike on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad on Christmas Eve, 1852. T h e first train entered Wheeling on January I , 1853, initiating sixteen-hour passenger service from Baltimore, a trip that had earlier taken several days by turnpike stagecoach. Thus in the first years of the decade four rival western lines had completed their original planned construction. T h e race between Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston to tap western trade via the railroad had finally ended in a virtual tie. More important was the fact that the four trans-Allegheny railroads had united the states of the Northeast and the Northwest well before the crisis of secession. Railroad construction in the Old Northwest in the fifties proceeded at a hectic rate, especially in the trunk-line region west of Pennsylvania. By 1860, Ohio was first in rail mileage in the nation, Illinois was second, and Indiana a strong fifth after New York and Pennsylvania. Much of the new construction in the region consisted of continuations of the trans-Allegheny lines of the East. Having extended their railroad to the Ohio at Wheeling, the owners of the Baltimore & Ohio sought the building of direct connecting lines westward to Cincinnati and St. Louis. Thomas Swann (1806-83) gave up the presidency of the B.&O. in 1853 but was\n\n39\n\nAmerican Railroads soon president of the new Northwestern Railroad of Virginia, a line from Grafton to Parkersburg on a more direct route toward Cincinnati. West of Parkersburg the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad was constructed, and west of Cincinnati the broad-gauge (six feet) Ohio and Mississippi Railway was built to complete the route to St. Louis. All three roads were finished by 1857,and the opening of the “American Central Line” from Baltimore to St. Louis was marked with several special trains carrying more than 2,500 persons. T h e entire route ultimately came under the control of the B.&O. Farther north the Pennsylvania Railroad had in 1856 acquired working control of a 468-mile route from Pittsburgh to Chicago, the recently completed Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad. In Michigan another westward-looking line was completed as a trio of Yankees, John Murray Forbes (1813-98), James E Joy (1810-96),and John W. Brooks (1819-81),completed the Michigan Central from Detroit to Chicago in May I 85 z. T h e same trio had just won a long-running dispute with some local Michigan farmers. T h e difficulty started when the railroad refused to pay more than half the value of killed livestock after it had gone to the trouble of fencing all its track. T h e farmers and sympathetic townspeople of Jackson County retaliated by filling journal boxes with sand, tampering with switches, greasing rails, and even subjecting cars and engines to fusillades of rocks and buckshot. After the burning of a depot the farmers were hailed into court on charges of conspiracy. A round dozen received jail sentences, despite the best defense efforts of New York lawyer William H. Seward. A second Michigan railroad, the Michigan Southern, also reached Chicago early in 1852.This line was to become part of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern, a road which Commodore Vanderbilt was to use as the western extension of his New York Central. Chicago, a city of thirty thousand residents by 1850,was the\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War focal point of much of the railroad-building in the decade. William Butler Ogden (1805-77), wealthy realtor and first mayor of the city, advocated in the middle forties that railroads be built to replace the growing plank-road network that served the city. Few Chicago merchants agreed with him, but by 1848 he had opened the first section of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (later a part of the Chicago & North Western), which was intended to serve the lead-mining region west of Chicago. In 1850 the 43-mile line was grossing $48,000 a year, had an operating ratio of less than 50 per cent, and boasted a new depot with a tower from which Ogden, using a marine telescope, spotted incoming trains for the benefit of passengers on the platform below. Within a few years most of the first-class hotels in the city had comparable cupolas in which men spied out incoming trains and boats so that omnibuses could be sent to meet the arriving passengers. Since each of the new rail lines had its own individual depot, the need for a transfer service between stations was soon obvious. In 1853 Frank Parmelee (I 8 I 6-1 904) established a transfer service long noted for its handsome rigs, excellent horseflesh, and genial and distinctively dressed drivers. In the fifties many radiating lines were built out of Chicago. T h e Forbes group pieced together the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy to reach two points on the Mississippi, the St. Louis, Alton and Chicago was built to St. Louis, and the 180-mile Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific was finished to Rock Island in the record time of under two years by Henry Farnam (1803-83) for the company’s president, John B. Jervis, builder of the Mohawk and Hudson. T h e Rock Island is remembered for building the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi (1856), a bridge both legally and physically threatened by rival steamboat interests. Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) was among the lawyers who won the subsequent lawsuit for the railroad. Of the eleven railroads that served Chicago in I 860 the Illinois\n\n41\n\nAmerican Railroads Central was the longest and perhaps the most important. Unlike most railroads in Illinois, it was a north-south line running the length of the state. Much like the shape of a thin wishbone, one section of the road ran south from Chicago and a second extended south from Dunleith, the two lines meeting at Centralia to continue down to Cairo. In 1850 Senators Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and William R. King (1786-1853) of Alabama maneuvered through Congress the first land-grant act aiding the building of a railroad. The law granted six alternate sections of land per mile of railroad to the Illinois Central in Illinois and the connecting Mobile and Ohio in the states of Mississippi and Alabama. In answering critics of the proposed land grant, Senator King, later VicePresident under Pierce, said: “This is an immense grant. . . but it will be there for five hundred years; and unless some mode of the kind proposed be adopted, it will never command ten cents.” The Illinois Central was soon profitably selling thousands of acres of its land and bringing hundreds of new settlers into the state. When the Illinois Central completed its main line in 1856, its seven hundred miles of track made it the longest railroad in the world. South of the Ohio and Potomac rivers several important railroads were completed in the decade before the Civil War. The sister line of the Illinois Central in the South, the Mobile & Ohio, finished its 483 miles of track from Mobile to Columbus, Kentucky, in the spring of 1861, just ten days before the start of the with Civil War. Under the leadership of James Robb (1814-81), some assistance from Judah P. Benjamin (1811-84), a second line to the North, the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern, was built from New Orleans to Canton, Mississippi. A connecting road, the Mississippi Central, continued the route into Kentucky. In the same years the uncouth but highly regarded James Guthrie (1792-1869) of Louisville, after retiring from Pierce’s cabinet in 1857, completed the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The major east-west route built in the decade consisted of four lines: the\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War Memphis and Charleston, running from Memphis to Chattanooga; the East Tennessee and Georgia, from Chattanooga to Knoxville; the East Tennessee and Virginia, from Knoxville to Bristol; and the Virginia and Tennessee, which ran to Lynchburg, Virginia. Every southern state added substantial railroad mileage in the decade. Virginia, because of the extension of new roads to the west (the B.&O. and the road to Bristol), easily led the South in rail construction and ended the decade with well over I ,700 miles of line, thereby demoting Georgia to second place for a few years. T h e American rail network of 1860 could be divided, on the basis of mileage, into nearly equal thirds: ten thousand miles in New England and the Middle Atlantic states, eleven thousand miles in the Middle West, and nine thousand miles in the South. But in average length, cost of construction, and volume of traffic the four hundred railroad lines in the three regions varied widely. In the Northeast, where traffic was heavy and the distances comparatively short, the nearly two hundred different lines averaged about fifty miles in length and were valued (in 1860) at an average of $48,000 per mile. In the Middle West the longer distances and often lighter construction and traffic produced figures of just over a hundred miles for average length of each line and a cost of $37,000 per mile. Southern lines averaged perhaps ninety miles in length and because of light construction, easy terrain, and low traffic density were valued at only $28,000 per mile on the eve of the Civil War. Technical advances in equipment and operation came naturally in the decade. Eleven different gauges were in use in the North, but by 1860 the standard gauge, 4 feet, 8% inches, was by far the most common. T h e great bulk of the southern railroads were still of the 5-foot gauge. In 1860, T-rails were the general rule, but a few branch lines and some roads in the South still had iron-capped wooden rails. Steel rails came into use only after the war. Most railway superintendents in the decade were ordering American43\n\nAmerican Railroads type (a swiveled four-wheeled truck in front plus four drivers) locomotives with functional cowcatcher, large headlight, and balloon stack. This type of engine (4-4-0) in I 860 had a name rather than a number, cost $8,000 to $10,000 to build, used wood or possibly coal for fuel, cost well under a dollar a mile for total operating expense, and was the pride and joy of the engine crew assigned to it. For heavy freight duty Ross Winan’s camel-back was still common on the B.&O., and a new Mogul-type (2-6-0) freight engine appeared in 1863. T h e best coaches now came equipped with corner toilet, water tank, and newsboy. During the last years of the decade a t least four men-Webster Wagner (1817-82) for the New York Central, Edward C. Knight (1813-92) for the B.&O., T. T. Woodruff (18119 2 ) for the Terre Haute and Alton, and George M. Pullman (183 I97) for the Chicago and Alton-were experimenting with sleeping cars. Pullman had earlier made a name for himself in Chicago by successfully lifting the four-story all-brick Tremont House several feet to the new street level with the aid of 1,200 men and some 5,000 jackscrews. Pullman’s sleeping car was to become the accepted model because he had, with equal ingenuity, worked out an upper berth which would disappear during the day while holding the bedding for both upper and lower beds. Night travel had become the accepted thing by 1860, but Sunday trains were still matters of dispute, especially in the southern states, until after the Civil War. Dining-car service was not yet available, the traveler having to be satisfied with hurried snacks bought at railroad eating houses during short scheduled stops. T h e fifties brought both a great expansion in railroad mileage and an increase in the number of railway accidents. Faulty track maintenance, poorly built bridges, careless railroad employees, and often the total absence of the most elementary safety precautions all contributed to the high catastrophe and casualty rate. As railroad superintendents and directors urged on the hectic rate of\n\n44\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War railroad-building, their motto often seemed to be: “Let’s lay more track and to hell with maintenance.” Carelessness by the engineer clearly caused the 1853 wreck a t Nonvalk, Connecticut, when a train ran on to an open drawbridge, killing 45 persons. T h e absence of any traffic control over the crossing of two rail lines in Illinois caused another wreck later that same spring, bringing death to 18 and injury to nearly 60. T h e total for the year was more than a hundred major rail accidents, with 234 passengers killed and 496 seriously injured. American railroad bridge-builders were among the cleverest in the world. John A. Roebling’s (1806-69) double-deck suspension bridge near Niagara Falls, which he had begun by flying a cordcarrying kite across the chasm, was finished in March, 18j j . But most of the wooden “Howe truss” bridges built in the fifties were not as safe as the Niagara bridge, the Erie Starucca Viaduct, or the enduring stone Thomas Viaduct on the B.&O. Too often the wooden bridges of the day grew tired, the trains fell through, and the car stoves ignited the resulting debris. N o r was the American rail system on the eve of the Civil War really an integrated network. Gauge diversity was one of the most serious handicaps to through service. In I 861, because of different gauges, eight changes of cars were necessary for a trip from Charleston to Philadelphia. Impediments to through traffic were caused not only by the absence of over-all planning but also by the presence of strong local economic interests. Tavern keepers, teamsters, and porters were happy that not a single rail line entering either Richmond or Philadelphia made a direct physical connection with any other railroad entering the city. Gaps in service were also to be found at the major rivers. While the Mississippi had been bridged before the war, neither the Ohio nor the Potomac was crossed by a railroad bridge in 1861.A major result of this variety of gauge, lack of transfer facility, and absence of important bridges was that in the railroad service of a century ago nearly ev45\n\nI\n\nGROWTH OF RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR\n\n-\n\n(Smwm~Dillcrmrcl in G a t l ~ ) spndardGauw\n\nTd,48%'\n\nk\n\nAmerican Railroads ery freight car belonged to the road on which it was running. True physical integration of the railroad network would have to wait until well after the Civil War. Imperfect as the network was, rail transportation in the period from mid-century to 1865 provided the nation with vast improvements in the movement of both goods and people. Railroad freight rates dropped substantially during the fifties. While the New York Central, Erie, and Pennsylvania lines had averaged from 2.4 cents to 3.5 cents a ton-mile in 1853, by 1860 the average rate for the three roads was less than 2 cents. As the rail network grew rapidly in the region north of the Ohio River, much of the western domestic commerce which had been accustomed to a southern water movement increasingly shifted to eastern markets that were reached by rail and the Great Lakes. Between 1852 and 1856 the arrival of wheat in Chicago increased ninefold, and comparable shipments of corn quadrupled. This grain came to Chicago via the new railroads, and much of it went on to the East the same way. New Orleans and the river boats even lost some of their cotton trade to the railroads. When the Western and Atlantic Railroad and the Memphis and Charleston were completed in the fifties, much of the cotton that once had descended the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers to an eventual market in the Crescent City went instead by rail to increase the exports of Savannah or Charleston. By 1860 the canal packets and river steamers had lost much of their passenger traffic, and many railroads had improved and sped up their schedules in the fifties. O n the eve of the Civil War the railroad passenger could travel from St. Louis to Boston in fortyeight hours or from New York to Charleston in sixty-two hours. He could buy a coupon ticket good for the entire trip from Bangor, Maine, to New Orleans, check his baggage the entire distance, and note the performance of his train and train crew in the railroad schedules and guidebooks recently made available.\n\n48\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War Despite its limitations the American rail network had by the Civil War furnished the nation with a transportation system far beyond anything made available by earlier forms of internal improvement. Turnpikes had never been built in any significant numbers in either the southern or western states, being limited chiefly to New England and the Middle Atlantic region. Canalbuilding had been somewhat more extensive in many states, but in 1850, when the mileage was near its peak, only fourteen states could claim as much as twenty-five miles of canal. By contrast, in 1860 every state save Minnesota and Oregon had railroad mileage, and twenty-nine of the thirty-three states had more than a hundred miles of line. More than a dozen lines were reaching west from the Mississippi into the states of Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. In fact, on the eve of the Civil War the western fingers of the rail network were very close to the frontier line. With the exception of small corners of Minnesota, Iowa, and Kansas, the Ozarks of Missouri and Arkansas, and much of eastern Texas, the western population of the Mississippi Valley was at least partially served by the railroad. In the fifties many Americans were also dreaming of and making plans for a railroad to the Pacific. Even before the Mexican War the arguments of h a Whimey (1797-1872)~ New York merchant and world traveler, for a railroad to the Pacific via the South Pass had gained modest support in Congress. The acquisition of California, the discovery of gold, and the prosperity of the period greatly increased the interest in such a project. Milwaukee, Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans all aspired to become the eastern terminus of the proposed rail route. In March, 1853, Congress appropriated $150,000 for the survey of four possible routes to the coast. Between 1853 and 1855, three central and southern routes were examined by U.S. Army engineers, and a northern route was surveyed by Isaac Stevens (I 8 I 862), governor of the Washington Territory. T h e Gadsden Pur-\n\n49\n\nAmerican Railroads chase of 1853, which had been urged upon President Franklin Pierce (I 804-69) by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (I 808-89), helped southerners feel that their favorite route would be selected. Early in 1854 Senator Douglas of Illinois, who clearly preferred a central route starting from Chicago, countered with his KansasNebraska Bill. Douglas hoped that the organization of territories west of the Missouri River would improve the chances of having the central rail route selected. In the resulting flare-up of antislavery and proslavery passions the Pacific railroad was largely forgotten. T h e Panic of 1857 definitely ended any thought of such a railroad in the fifties. T h e depression of the late fifties checked rail construction moderately in the rest of the nation. As the rate of expansion declined, attention was frequently given to consolidation and improvement of rail management. O n the eve of the Civil War American railroads were ready for, were waiting for, an increase in business. T h e war brought that increase. If the increase in business which came with the Civil War improved the economic health of the American railroads, the railroads, in turn, materially aided the Union cause. Had the war started a decade earlier, before the substantial rail construction of the fifties, both the military and economic contributions to northern victory made by the bottled-up Ohio and upper Mississippi valleys would have been significantly smaller. In the quarter of a century before 1850 the competition for the commercial allegiance of the Northwest had resulted in a near tie between the Erie Canal boats from the Northeast and the river steamers from the South. In the fifties the economic victory had gone to the Northeast as hundreds of miles of new railroad iron crossed the granite barrier of the Alleghenies to enter the Old Northwest. Iron rails and puffing locomotives helped the Northwest decide that it would support the Union. As the Union and the Confederacy faced the prospect of war in the spring of 1861, their respective rail systems offered more in\n\nEarly Maturity: Expansion and War the way of contrast than comparison. With roughly nine thousand miles of line, the eleven Confederate States could claim a small third of the nation’s rail mileage. Their roads were more lightly constructed, carried a correspondingly smaller volume of traffic, and employed no more than a fifth of the country’s railroad employees. A traditional dislike for mechanical pursuits in the South had resulted in the employment of many n"
