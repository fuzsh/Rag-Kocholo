        "text": "Cape Cod Central Railroad\n\nThe first New England railroads, a trio of lines radiating from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence, were completed in 1835, and rail service reached Plymouth in 1845. A line from Middleborough to Wareham and then to Sandwich was completed in May 1848. Cape Cod did not get a railroad connection until the Old Colony Rail Road completed its line to Wareham and Sandwich. In 1854 the line was extended to Barnstable, Yarmouth, and then the port of Hyannis, where steamers docked for trips to the islands. Tracks were extended to Wellfleet in January 1871 and to Provincetown in July 1873.\n\nThis expansion in southeastern Massachusetts should be viewed against the rapid industrialization of the U.S. after 1865, with earlier efforts marking incremental progress in the use of the railroad to further economic growth. The railroad age had started in the 1830s in Great Britain, when lines were laid to haul both passengers and freight (often ore from mines). But even earlier, in Quincy Massachusetts in 1826, the Granite Railroad used three horse-pulled wagons riding on iron-covered wooden rails to haul stone from a quarry to a dock at Boston Harbor. After the Civil War, every town wanted to be connected to the railroad. In the 1880s seventy-one thousand miles of track were laid, most of it west of the Mississippi, a boom enabled in part by the federal land grants offered in the 1872 Morrill Act. The taking, or granting, of land for railroad right-of-way was central to the growth of the many lines that crisscrossed the Northeast and the Midwest.\n\nJoseph Story Fay, a Boston merchant, was the first of the summer visitors and one of the most generous. Early recognizing the importance of bringing the railroad to Woods Hole, he divided his own property for its construction. When he had purchased a large farm in Woods Hole in 1850, Falmouth and Woods Hole were still served by stage lines with four horses on each stage.\n\nIn 1861 a group of businessmen in Falmouth petitioned the legislature to grant a charter for a line from Cohasset Narrows (Buzzards Bay) to Woods Hole, and approval was given on April 11, 1861. The next day, the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina and construction was postponed.\n\nIn 1864 a new name, The Cape Cod Central Railroad, was approved by the legislature, but the first train arrived in Falmouth and Woods Hole only on July 18, 1872. This new line was 17.5 miles from Cohasset Narrows with stations at North Falmouth, West Falmouth, Falmouth, and Woods Hole.\n\nFreight trains were also central to this period of intense railway activity. The Falmouth Station was a very active spot in town with the freight yards often filled with freight cars. Many businesses were dependent on the railroad, including Falmouth Coal Co., Lawrence Grain Co., and Wood Lumber Co. Every evening Sam Cahoon sent carloads of iced fresh fish from Woods Hole to Boston and New York. Strawberry growers in East Falmouth sent carloads of iced fresh strawberries to Boston, where they became a welcome addition to urban markets and a major source of revenue for local growers.\n\nIn 1890 Captain Lewis H. Lawrence built a grain mill on the west side of the railroad tracks and a railroad siding was constructed to bring freight cars to the mill. Frederick T. Lawrence, Jr., the grandson of Captain Lawrence, described this siding in The Book of Falmouth (p. 79):\n\n“The railroad’s freight platform extended to within 42 feet of the Lawrence Bros. mill. It was large enough to unload wagons, autos, cement and the annual circus. Later it was expanded east to an entrance off Palmer Avenue with the addition of three tracks.”\n\nThe Pacific Guano Company on Long Neck, now Penzance Point, in Woods Hole was an initial beneficiary of the railroad. The company produced fertilizer for almost 25 years, processing guano from islands in the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico with fish meal made from locally caught fish. In 1872 it produced and shipped out by rail 16,000 tons of fertilizer. The processing plant closed in 1889, primarily because inorganic fertilizers took over the market.\n\nAnother beneficiary of the railroad extension was the Falmouth Coal Company. Wilbur Dyer came from Westfield, Maine to Falmouth in 1912 as the railroad station master, and later established the Falmouth Coal Company. His son, Arnold, notes that when the family arrived both the old and new Stations were standing before the older building was demolished.\n\nIn 1924, Wilbur Dyer bought two independent coal companies that included the land behind the Enterprise office where there were coal bins and later oil tanks alongside a rail siding. His grandson, Wilbur (Bill) Dyer, continues with the fourth generation of the business as the Falmouth Energy Company.\n\nThe Flying Dude\n\nIn 1884 several industrialists asked the Old Colony Railroad to offer a private train by subscription from Boston to Falmouth and Woods Hole. The inaugural trip of The Flying Dude left Boston at 3:10 pm on June 13, 1884, and arrived in Woods Hole at 4:50 pm in time for the 5:00 ferry to Martha’s Vineyard. For thirty-two years there were enough paying passengers for this railroad service to run from June to early October each year.\n\nThough subscription trains had become common in this age of industrial barons, the Dude was described in a 1904 Enterprise as “the finest train in New England.”\n\nConductor Augustus Messer was a dignified presence on the Dude from 1890 to 1904, and spent thirty-two years on the Boston to Woods Hole run. He was familiar with all the passengers, including President Grover Cleveland, who alighted at Gray Gables near the Summer White House in Bourne. In 1904 the former conductor started his first run of the season and suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. The Flying Dude made its last trip on October 2, 1916.\n\nSocietal Impacts\n\nThe following excerpts were published in the Falmouth Enterprise on July 1, 1905:\n\n“At noon, Monday, St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in this village was the scene of one of the most brilliant weddings ever solemnized in this town for Miss Mary Emmons, and John Parkinson, Jr. The young couple are society leaders on the summer set in Falmouth and Buzzards Bay and have known each other since childhood. Many guests for the wedding came by a special train that left Boston at 9:25 in the morning, reaching here at 11:45 and the guests were taken in carriages to the church. The ceremony was witnessed by upwards of 200 guests.\n\nThe bridal party took carriages to the summer home of the father of the bride, where a wedding breakfast was served and the nuptial festivities continued until late in the afternoon. The reception was held in the parlor and the guests were served refreshments on tables on the lawn. The bride and groom took their departure on the 2:27 train for Boston.”\n\nFalmouth Station\n\nThe original Falmouth Station was built in 1872 of wood and provided service for more than forty years.\n\nIn 1914, a new “fancy” brick station was constructed with stone cornices, a red tiled floor and an iron and glass canopy.\n\nHowever, after the construction of the interstate highways in the 1950s and the increasing use of cars and buses to get to Falmouth and Woods Hole, rail service declined to the point that the station was scheduled to be razed. A group of concerned citizens petitioned that the station be saved. Improvements to the Falmouth Station were completed in 1989 with funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and included improved facilities in the ticket area, exterior landscaping, and handicap access.\n\nThe most recent refurbishment was completed in 2017 under the auspices of the Falmouth Economic Development and Industrial Corporation (EDIC) with funding from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (which owns the property and leases it to EDIC in a 99-year lease).\n\nThe Station serves Peter Pan Bus Lines (with service from Woods Hole and Falmouth to Boston, Logan Airport, Providence and New York City); the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority, with service Woods Hole to Falmouth and other towns on the Cape; the seasonal Trolley to Woods Hole; and the local taxi companies.\n\nThe station backs up to the celebrated Shining Sea Bikeway built on the original railroad right-of-way in the 1970s and runs for more than ten miles from Woods Hole to North Falmouth. The Bikeway attracts many visitors—bikers and walkers of all ages—to the area. The bike path crosses Depot Avenue by the handsomely restored Falmouth Station, where bikers can stop for refreshment and a short rest."
