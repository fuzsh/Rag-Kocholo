        "text": "The National Streetcar Museum at Lowell is OPEN on Saturdays & Sundays from 11AM-4PM, year-round.\n\nLocated at 25 Shattuck Street, join us at the National Streetcar Museum at Lowell and learn more about the streetcar, more commonly known as the trolley. If you or your group loves railroads, history, transit, and Lowell, this museum is for you! Children will love our interactive exhibits and displays, especially our hands-on activities. Our knowledgeable volunteers will answer any questions you have, and give you a guided tour of our displays if you would like. The average museum visit by families is 45-60 minutes.\n\nAfter stopping in at Lowell National Historical Park’s Visitor Center, visit us across the street at the Mack Building and browse our exhibit about the influence of street railways on the development of our cities.\n\nAdmission is $3 ; Seniors and youth ages 3-12 are $2, and children under three are free. Admission for Seashore Trolley Museum members is also free! At the museum we accept cash and check; we’re such a small operation that accepting credit cards would mean our admission prices would significantly increase, due to the expense of accepting credit cards. Instead, we’re providing an Eventbrite site for those who would prefer to pay admission by credit card for your convenience.\n\nMetered, on-street parking is available in front of the museum. Parking is free in the National Park Service Visitor Center Lot every day. Additionally, there is no charge for on-street parking meters in Lowell on Sundays.\n\nBefore or after you visit, hop on one of the National Park Services’ trolleys for a free trolley ride, with a stop near the museum. More information including trolley schedules can be found on the NPS website.\n\nFor questions, please email [email protected]. The National Streetcar Museum at Lowell is a satellite museum of the Seashore Trolley Museum, located in Kennebunkport, ME, in cooperation with the Lowell National Historical Park and the City of Lowell.\n\nFollow us and like us on Facebook!"
