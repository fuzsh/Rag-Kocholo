Its great rival was the Pennsylvania Railroad. The B&O was the first Class I railroad in the U.S. as well as one of the first in the nation. During its peak years, the railroad carried coal, steel, and other freight, as well as passengers, as far North as New York City, and as far west as Chicago. Most surviving trackage is operated by CSX Transportation. The B&O provided critical logistic support to the Union during the Civil War, when it was the target of repeated Confederate raids.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad\n\nItem: 4-B Victorian style Price: $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1879-1917\n\nForged by the E.T.

It was the first intercity railroad in the United States. The most important American East Coast seaports in the early 1800s were Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston, South Carolina. Baltimore had an advantage in being farther inland than the others (and therefore closer to many markets), being located almost at the head of navigation on Chesapeake Bay, the estuary of the Susquehanna River. New York gained an advantage in 1825 with the opening of the Erie Canal, permitting navigation as far as Lake Erie, and in 1826 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered a system of canals to link Philadelphia with the Ohio River at Pittsburgh.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.\n\nItem: 5-B Victorian style Price: $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1921-30\n\nFraim/Slaymaker forged.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe B&O was the target of repeated Confederate attacks during the American Civil War. Union forces often failed to properly secure the region, despite the vital importance of the railroad in providing supplies and troops to the battlefronts. Confederate general \"Stonewall\" Jackson made the Railroad his favorite target. Nevertheless, under the leadership of president John W. Garrett the B&O increased its operations, and increased its profits during the war.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.\n\nItem: 6-B Victorian style Price: $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1921-30\n\nFraim/Slaymaker forged.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and dark chocolate patina.\n\nGiven the moniker,\"Best and Only\"\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nIn 1960 the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C&O) began to acquire B&O stock. NYC made a bid, but B&O's stockholders approved C&O control, and on May 1, 1962, so did the ICC. By early 1964 C&O owned 90% of B&O's stock. In 1967 the ICC authorized C&O and B&O to control WM; B&O's WM stock had long been held in a nonvoting trust. On June 15, 1973, B&O, C&O, and WM were made subsidiaries of the newly created Chessie System, although they continued to operate as separate railroads. There was no great surge of track abandonment, because in most areas B&O and C&O were complementary rather than competitive. In 1981 B&O leased the former Rock Island trackage from Blue Island to Henry, Illinois. B&O continued to exist with the Chessie System. On May 1, 1983, B&O assumed operations of the WM. Four years later, on April 30, 1987, C&O merged B&O, and four months after that, CSX Transportation merged the C&O.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.\n\nItem: 7-B Price: $75.00 $65.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1921-30\n\nFraim/Slaymaker forged.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nAnother moniker, \"Backward and Obsolete.\"\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad\n\nItem: 8-B Price: $55.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid 1900s\n\nNice cursive lettering and gold patina.\n\nDifferent but nice!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad\n\nItem: 9-B Price: $40.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early-mid 1900s\n\nAttractive serif stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad\n\nItem: 10-B Price: $50.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1904-21\n\nForged by the S.R.

Brightly painted BAR box cars attracted national attention in the 1950s. First-generation diesel locomotives operated on BAR until they were museum pieces. The economic downturn of the 1980s coupled with the departure of heavy industry from northern Maine forced the railroad to seek a buyer and end operations in 2003.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBangor & Aroostook Railroad\n\nSOLD Price: $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nNice serif stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe company was incorporated in 1891 to combine the lines of the former Bangor & Piscataquis Railroad and the Bangor & Katahdin Iron Works Railway. It was based in Bangor & lines extended from there to Oakfield and Houlton in 1894.\n\nIn 1995, the BAR was acquired by Iron Road Railways. In 2002, the company was declared bankrupt, and in 2003 its lines were sold to Rail World, which initially incorporated them into its newly formed Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway subsidiary.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBarre & Chelsea Railroad\n\nItem: 30-B Price: $125.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nOnced owned by the B&M.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and two-tone patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Barre Railroad Company was incorporated April 9, 1888, under general laws of Vermont to construct, maintain, and operate a railroad from the village of Barre to the granite quarries in said town of Barre and Williamstown, Vt. The date of organization was April 10, 1888.\n\nThe East Barre & Chelsea Railroad Company, the only predecessor, was incorporated July 20, 1892, under general laws of Vermont to construct and maintain a railroad from a point of connection with tracks of The Barre Railroad Company in the town of Barre, to East Barre, Vt. The date of organization was September 11, 1892.\n\nThe owned mileage was acquired partly by construction and partly by merger. The records reviewed indicate that 13.819 miles of road was constructed by The Barre Railroad Company during 1888-89, and 1.673 miles was acquired by merger from the East Barre & Chelsea Railroad Company, constructed by or for that company during 1891-92, or a total of 15.492 miles.\n\nThe majority of the Granite District was part of the Boston & Maine Railroad (B&M) system until 1926, when the Barre & Chelsea Railroad (Barre to Graniteville) and Montpelier & Wells River Railroad (Barre and Montpelier to Wells River) were sold to local interests. The latter was consolidated into the former in January 1945, but in 1957 the entire Barre & Chelsea Railroad was abandoned.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBelt Railway of Chicago\n\nItem: 34-B Price: $25.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nHistory\n\nChartered in 1882, the Belt Railway Company of Chicago (BRC), headquartered in Bedford Park, IL, is the largest switching terminal railroad in the United States. It is co-owned by six Class I railroads; BNSF Railway, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad, each of which uses the switching and interchange facilities of the BRC. Owner lines and other railroads bring their trains to the Belt Railway to be separated, classified, and re-blocked into new trains for departure. The BRC also provides rail terminal services to approximately 100 local manufacturing industries.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBelt Railway of Chicago\n\nItem: 35-B Price: $40.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe Clearing Yard, located on the boundary between Chicago and Bedford Park, Illinois, just south of Chicago Midway International Airport, is one of the largest hump classification facilities in the United States. Some 5.5 miles in length and covering 786 acres the yard supports more than 250 miles (400 km) of track. It has six main subdivisions; one arrival, classification, and departure yard in the eastbound and westbound directions.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBelt Railway of Chicago\n\nItem: 36-B Price: $30.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBessemer & Lake Erie Railroad\n\nItem: 39-B Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. pre-1927\n\nForged by the Wilson Bohannan Co.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (BLE) is a class II railroad that operates in northwestern Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio.The railroad's main route runs from the Lake Erie port of Conneaut, Ohio to the Pittsburgh suburb of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, a distance of 139 miles. The original rail ancestor of the B&LE, the Shenango & Allegheny Railroad, began operation in October 1869.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBessemer & Lake Erie Railroad\n\nItem: 40-B Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. pre-1927\n\nForged by the Wilson Bohannan Co.\n\nSuperb serif stamp marksand gold patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nIn 1988 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of Transtar, Inc., a privately held transportation holding company with principal operations in railroad freight transportation, dock operations, Great Lakes shipping, and inland river barging that were formerly subsidiaries of USX, the holding company that owns U.S. Steel. In 2001 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of Great Lakes Transportation, LLC. On May 10, 2004 Canadian National Railway acquired the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad.

Known as the Beaver & Ellwood Railroad, the line provided passenger service to the Park Gate station, as well as freight service to Ellwood City industries. In April of 1892 The Ellwood Connecting Railroad was incorporated by the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie to make the connection to the Beaver & Ellwood Railroad but did not open until June of 1893. In May of 1899, the Beaver & Ellwood Railroad was leased to the P&LE for twenty years. On a side note, July of the same year, the Beaver & Ellwood Railroad acquired the Ellwood Southern Railroad Company.\n\nFinally June 6, 1910 the P&LE purchased the entire issue of stock of the Beaver & Ellwood Railroad Company and merged it with the Ellwood Connecting Railroad Company in January 1911.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Albany Railroad\n\nItem: 45-B Price: $100.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nNice pocket worn lettering and silver patina.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Boston and Albany Railroad (reporting mark B&A) was a railroad connecting Boston, Massachusetts to Albany, New York, later becoming part of the New York Central Railroad system, Conrail, and CSX Transportation. The line is currently used by CSX for freight. Passenger service is still provided on the line by Amtrak, as part of their Lake Shore Limited service, and by the MBTA Commuter Rail system, which owns the section east of Worcester and operates it as its Framingham/Worcester Line.\n\nThe connection from Boston to Albany formed the longest and most expensive point-to-point railroad yet constructed in the United States. Two mergers, on September 4, 1867 and December 28, 1870 brought the three companies, along with the Hudson and Boston Railroad, together into one company, known as the Boston and Albany Railroad. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad leased the B&A for 99 years from July 1, 1900. This lease passed to the New York Central Railroad in 1914; throughout this, the B&A kept its own branding in the public eye. The NYC merged into Penn Central on February 1, 1968.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad\n\nItem: 46-B New Listing Price: $175.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nRare narrow-gauge key.\n\nNice pocket worn lettering and patina.\n\nMy guess is - T.

It became part of what is now the Pan Am Railways network in 1983.\n\nB&M's earliest corporate predecessor was the Andover & Wilmington Railroad, opened in August 1836 from Andover, Massachusetts, south to a junction with the B&L at Wilmington, approximately 7 miles. The B&M grew for the most part by acquisition, not by construction. The oldest component of the B&M was the 25-mile route between Boston and Lowell, Massachusetts, opened by the Boston & Lowell Railroad (B&L) on June 24, 1835, but not acquired until much later. The B&M's 19th century history consists of four distinct routes.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nItem: 48-B Eastern Division Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1904-21\n\nForged by the S.R.

In 1950 it was a well-run, progressive railroad, in a region that was losing its heavy industry and beginning to build interstate superhighways. In 1956, Patrick B. McGinnis became president of the B&M, bringing in a new image, not just blue replacing maroon on the locomotives and cars but a new way of doing things: deficits, deferred maintenance, and kickbacks on the sale of B&M's streamlined passenger cars, which ultimately culminated in a prison sentence that ended his career in railroading.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nItem: 49-B Eastern Division Price: $65.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1904-21\n\nForged by the S.R.

Under the leadership of Alan Dustin, the B&M bought new locomotives, rebuilt its track, and changed its attitude. The revived B&M went after new business and expanded its operations. It sold the tracks and rolling stock to MBTA in 1975, but retained freight rights on those lines and continued to operate the trains for MBTA. In 1977 it assumed operation of commuter trains on the former NH and B&A lines out of Boston's South Station. In 1982 it bought several Conrail lines in Massachusetts and Connecticut and began operating coal trains and piggyback service.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nItem: 50-B Price: $65.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nNice stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nThis key will work with the older Corbin locks\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nItem: 51-B New Listing Price: $20.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Wilson Bohannan Co.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBoston & Maine Railroad\n\nItem: 52-B Price: $20.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early-mid 1900s.

For its first 55 years, the road was operated under lease by the Maine Central as its Belfast Branch, which provided daily passenger and freight service to eight stations over the length of Waldo County, Maine. After the MEC cancelled its lease in 1925, the B&MLRR began running trains under its own name. Passenger operations ceased in March 1960, although in 1988, the railroad began operating summer tourist trains to offset a decline in freight traffic. In 1991, the city sold its interest in the money-losing railroad to private owners. In 2007, the railroad ended operations as the B&MLRR.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBeaver Dam Railroad\n\nItem: 56-B Price: $95.00 $75.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Beaver Dam Railroad was a short-line railroad that operated in the U.S. states of Virginia and Tennessee in the early 20th century between the towns of Damascus, Virginia and Crandull, Tennessee. The line was abandoned in sections beginning in 1918 with portions still remaining in operation into the 1920s. Today, much of the old route is followed by Tennessee State Route 133.\n\nThe Backbone Rock tunnel was a short tunnel on the Beaver Dam Railroad's Tennessee section, blasted through in 1901 from a rock cliff that stood in the way of the railroad's progression. At only twenty-two feet in length, the tunnel was known locally as the \"shortest tunnel in the world.\"\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBelvidere Delaware Railroad\n\nItem: 64-B Price: $225.00\n\nRemarks: ca. 1863-1904\n\nForged by Romer & Co.\n\nGreat stamp marks and carmel patina.\n\n150 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Belvidere-Delaware Railroad was chartered on March 2, 1836 and was constructed from Trenton along the Delaware River north to Belvidere, New Jersey. Beyond Belvidere, the line would connect to a proposed line that headed west to the Susquehanna River through Pennsylvania. The Trenton-Lambertville section opened on February 6, 1851, eventually reaching Belvidere on November 5, 1855.\n\nThe Belvidere Delaware Railroad and the Flemington Railroad & Transportation Company merged on February 16, 1885 to form the Belvidere Delaware Railroad.\n\nIn 1908 the PRR acquired trackage rights on the nearby Lehigh & Hudson River Railway (L&HR) and DL&W. The following year, the PRR shifted its railyard from Lambertville to Trenton. By the 1950s steam locomotives had been replaced with diesel operated self-propelled Doodlebugs as a cost-saving measure resulting from dwindling patronage, In August 1955, flood waters from the Delaware River caused by Hurricane Diane washed out portions of the line north of Belvidere near where the right-of-way crosses modern-day US Route 46, although the line still remains active south of this point to serve a chemical manufacturing plant. North of where the plant is now to the junction at Manunka Chunk was subsequently removed. On December 31, 1957, the Bel Del was merged into the United New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company, with passenger services ending by October 25, 1960.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBritish Columbia Railway\n\nItem: 66-B New Listing Price: $175.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nPacific Great Eastern key style.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Buffalo Creek & Gauley Railroad (BC&G) was a railroad chartered on April 1, 1904 and ran along Buffalo Creek in Clay County, West Virginia. The original Buffalo Creek & Gauley ended service in 1965.\n\nThe BC&G was one of the last all-steam railroads, never operating a diesel locomotive to the day it shut down in 1965. Its primary purpose was to bring coal out of the mountains above Widen to an interchange with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Dundon.\n\nAfter the BC&G ended operations in 1965 it was reactivated in 1971 by the Majestic Mining Company to serve a mine at Widen.The company used an Alco S-2 for power and the operation concluded in 1985. The line was then again reactivated in the mid-1990s when the Elk River Railroad, Inc. (TERRI) reopened the route to Avoca to serve a mine there. The operation lasted only a few years until 1999 when American Electric Power (AEP) determined the coal to be too poor in quality.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBuffalo & Lockport Railroad\n\nItem: 68-B Price: $200.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nGreat stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nKey listed in the\n\n\"American Railway's Switch Key Directory.\"\n\nEarly NYC aquisition.\n\n125 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Buffalo & Lockport Railroad was chartered April 27, 1852, to build a branch of the Rochester, Lockport and Niagara Falls from Lockport towards Buffalo.

The B&L was intended to give access to this line at Cambridge Junction to Burlington VT (and the railroads that ran there). The line was completed in 1877 and almost immediately became a leased subsidiary of the Central Vermont Railroad.\n\nThe line never saw the anticipated bridge traffic, and the sparsely populated region it traversed didn't provide much traffic either. The line ended up being another victim of the Great Depression, although holding out longer then most and lasting until 1938. The last mile of trackage, from Cambridge Junction into Jeffersonville was transferred to the St.J&LC railroad at this time, who operated it as a spur.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBuffalo Creek Railroad\n\nSOLD New Listing Price: $120.00\n\nRemarks: mid 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nNice deep stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nGiven the moniker, \"the Crik\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Buffalo Creek Railroad was a terminal and switching railroad that operated on the waterfront area of Buffalo, New York. The company was in existence from 1869 to 1976, operating on 5.66 miles with a total trackage of 34.22 miles. It was formed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad Company (Erie Lackawanna Railway) which each owned 50% of the company\n\nThe railroad primarily served the grain elevators in present-day 'Silo City' and adjacent area of Buffalo, including that of General Mills. The site was advantageous due to its location on the Buffalo River and the eastern coast of Lake Erie. The railroad connected with seven major railroads. In addition, the railroad owned a fleet of over 1,700 40-foot boxcars for transporting flour.\n\nThe railroad was taken over by Conrail in 1976\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Northern Railway\n\nItem: 76-B Price: $50.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1900s\n\nKeline forged.\n\nVery nice serif stamp marks.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Burlington Northern Railroad was the product of a March 2, 1970, merger of four major railroads, the Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railway, Spokane-Portland & Seattle Railway and the Chicago-Burlington & Quincy Railroad, as well as a few small jointly owned subsidiaries owned by the four.

Hill era, the four railroads previously had unsuccessfully attempted four mergers to unify the Hill Lines: 1896, 1901, 1927 and 1955. Surprisingly the merger was finally approved in 1970 even though a challenge occurred in the Supreme Court, which reversed the result of the 1904 Northern Securities ruling.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Northern Railroad\n\nItem: 78-B M = post merger key Price: $55.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nAttractive stamp marks and patina.\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nTo further expand the Burlington Northern railroad, a single track was constructed in 1972 into the Powder River Basin to serve various coal mines. On November 21, 1980, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway was acquired, giving the railroad trackage as far south into Florida. By 1981, however, the holding company of the railroad, Burlington Northern, Inc. relocated headquarters from Saint Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington and spun off all non-rail operations to Burlington Resources in 1988.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Northern Railroad\n\nItem: 79-B Price: $35.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-late 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nAttractive stamp marks and patina.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Northern Railroad\n\nItem: 80-B Price: $55.00 $45.00\n\nRemarks: ca. mid-1900s\n\nKeyline forged.

The charter was obtained by citizens of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, who were concerned that the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad would bypass their towns in favor of West Chicago on its route; at the time, that was the only line running west from Chicago.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Route Railroad\n\nItem: 88-B Price: $125.00\n\nRemarks: ca. late 1800s\n\nNice tapered barrel.\n\nAttractive stamp marks and gold patina.\n\nSame style cut as BR keys above.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nThe company was renamed Chicago and Aurora Railroad on June 22, 1852, and given expanded powers to extend from Aurora to a point north of LaSalle; this extension, to Mendota, was completed on October 20, 1853. Another amendment, passed February 28, 1854, authorized the company to build east from Aurora to Chicago via Naperville, and changed its name to Chicago and Southwestern Railroad. The latter provision was never acted upon, and was repealed by an act of February 14, 1855, which instead reorganized the line as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Route Railroad\n\nItem: 89-B Price: $95.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nNice stamp marks and silver patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nFollowing the purchase of the Burlington by GN and NP, expansion continued. In 1908, the CB&Q purchased both the Colorado & Southern and Fort Worth & Denver Railways, giving it access south to Dallas and the Gulf of Mexico ports in Houston and Galveston. It also extended its reach south in the Mississippi Valley region by opening up a new line from Concord, Illinois south to Paducah, Kentucky. It was during this period that the Burlington was at its largest, exceeding just over 12,000 route miles in 14 states by the 1920s.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Route Railroad\n\nItem: 90-B Price: $50.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early-mid 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nAfter the Second World War, the CB&Q had overworked steam locomotives in a fleet which it was beginning to convert to diesel engines. The company rapidly expanded its diesel program and slowly took steam locomotives out of service. On September 28, 1959, the last steam-powered commuter train from Chicago rolled to a stop in Downers Grove, marking the end of steam passenger operations on the railroad.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington Route Railroad\n\nItem: 91-B Price: $50.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early-mid 1900s\n\nForged by the Adlake Co.\n\nNice stamp marks and gold patina.\n\n80 year + octogenarian!\n\nHistory - continued from above\n\nAs the financial situation of American railroading continued to decline through the 1960s, forcing restructuring across the country, the Burlington Railroad merged with the Great Northern, Northern Pacific, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway railroads on March 2, 1970, to form the Burlington Northern (26 years later, the BN and Santa Fe Railroads merged to become BNSF). Passenger service was markedly reduced, as people had shifted to using private automobiles for many trips.

The Burlington Zephyr, the first American diesel-electric powered streamlined passenger train, made its noted \"dawn-to-dusk\" run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago, Illinois, on May 26, 1934. On November 11, 1934, the train was put into regularly scheduled service between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. Although the distinctive, articulated stainless steel trains were well known, and the railroad adopted the \"Way of the Zephyrs\" advertising slogan, they did not attract passengers back to the rails en masse, and the last one was retired from revenue service with the advent of Amtrak.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington & Missouri River Railroad\n\nItem: 96-B Price: $145.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and silver patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nThe Burlington & Missouri River Railroad (B&MR) was an American railroad company incorporated in Iowa in 1852, with headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. It was developed to build a railroad across the state of Iowa and began operations in 1856. It was acquired by the Chicago-Burlington & Quincy Railroad in 1872, and kept serving as its subsidiary.\n\nThe Burlington & Missouri River Railroad was incorporated in Burlington, Iowa in 1852. It commenced operations on January 1, 1856 with only a few miles of track. In 1857 it connected to Ottumwa, followed by Murray in 1858. It finally reached the Missouri River in November 1859. It used wood-burning locomotives and wooden passenger cars.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBurlington & Missouri River Railroad\n\nItem: 97-B Price: $175.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and silver patina.\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nBuffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Railroad\n\nItem: 99-B Price: $85.00\n\nRemarks: ca. early 1900s\n\nForged by the Adams & Westlake Co.\n\nSuperb stamp marks and carmel patina.\n\nGiven the moniker,\n\n\"Bums, Robbers and Pickpockets\"\n\n100 year + centenarian!\n\nHistory\n\nChartered in 1869, the BR&P, a former class 1 railroad, aquired a reputation as a coal hauler line. In 1932 the Baltimore & Ohio purchased the BR&P. Fast forward to 1973, the C&O created the Chessie System who then sold the Rochester branch to the Genesee & Wyoming Railroad in 1986. Thus creating the Rochester & Southern Railroad. In April 1988 the remainder of the BR&P became the Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, also a G&W subsidiary.

It was used primarily to take copper ore from the mines to the smelter in Anaconda, though it did also carry passengers and freight. The railroad converted to electric in 1913, the first primarily freight line in the nation to do so. Electrification was abandoned in 1967 when it became cheaper to use diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nDuring the past decade, a portion of the line has been converted to the BA&P Copperway Trail, and is part of an ever-growing network of walking trails in Butte. Though BA&P is still in operation, the railroad's parent company, Patriot Rail Corp., closed the railroad's office in Anaconda earlier this year.\n\nClick on image to view larger picture\n\nSwitch Key Directory\n\nAmerican Railway's Switch Key Directory\n\nPrice: HC-$25.00 | CD-$35\n\nWhether your just starting out collecting switch key's or you have been a collector for many years, this 44 page switch key directory is a useful tool.
