Steam locomotives used large amounts of fuel (wood and coal) and water. By 1921 American railroads consumed over 900 billion gallons of water annually, or about 2.5 billion gallons daily, more than any single water system delivered. Railroad companies could either develop their own water systems or buy water from local water works where they existed (if the price was right). Water systems developed by railroads would often serve nearby railroad properties, including stations, maintenance shops and hotels, but in many cases would supply water to communities.\n\nReferences\n\n1850 Observations on the consumption of fuel and the evaporation of water in locomotive and other steam engines, by Edward Woods.\n\n1851 The Locomotive Engine: Including a Description of Its Structure, Rules for Estimating Its Capabilities, and Practical Observations on Its Construction and Management, by Zerah Colburn\n\n1870 Union Pacific Railroad: Report of G.M.

The tank holds fifty thousand gallons; the pump will fill it in ten hours. When it is full, the water lifts a little float: that pulls a wire, the wire shuts up the sails of the windmill, a dozen yards away, and it instantly stops. When the tank gets nearly empty, the action of another float opens the sails, and the windmill starts again. The cost of the ingenious apparatus all set up is about six thousand dollars. It might be used to great advantage for irrigating. It is one of a thousand instances in which modern machinery, not content with merely utilizing the forces of Nature, disciplines them into doing their appointed work, without any eye to overlook them or any hand to regulate.\n\nPage 289: Another day upon the desert. It seems to stretch out to the crack of doom. Nobody can realize how great a work this has been until he takes the long ride of four or five days and nights through dreary wastes and unbroken solitudes. On this immediate portion of the road the alkali water would corrode boilers and soon destroy them. For a hundred miles, therefore, water is carried in tanks, upon platform cars, for the locomotives. A supply will ultimately be brought from the Truckee River, thirty-three miles, through bored tamarack logs. Several stations are already furnished in that way, from springs six or eight miles distant. On the Union Pacific, also, through the Bitter Creek country, water is carried thirty or forty miles upon trains, to overcome the same difficulty.\n\n1872 A First Person Account by Walter Scott Fitz of his Remarkable 36-Day Transcontinental Rail Journey from Boston to San Francisco including a Three Week, Snowbound Passage Between Cheyenne & Bitter Creek in Wyoming via the UPRR.

R. Knowles, Superintendent of Water Service of the Illinois Central Railroad, recognized as the foremost authority on the subject, the estimated annual consumption of water by the railroads is 900,000,000,000 gallons. As a considerable proportion of the water used by railroads, amounting to 23 percent in some instances, is purchased from municipal or private water corporations, and hence is metered, and as a number of the larger companies have water service departments which keep careful records, this estimate is more than a mere guess.\n\n1921 \"Construction of the Pacific Railroad,\" American Railway Engineering Society 23(237):7-47 (July 1921)\n\n1921 \"Railway Uses of Concrete,\" American Railway Engineering Society 23(238) (August1921)\n\nPages 84-: Water Tanks\n\n1923 \"Guaranty Status of Union Pacific Water Company,\" January 18, 1923, Interstate Commerce Commission Reports\n\n1924 Epic of the Overland, by Robert Lardin Fulton\n\n1926 The overland mail 1849-1869: promoter of settlement, precursor of railroads, by Le Roy Reuben Hefan\n\n1950 The First Transcontinental Railroad: Central Pacific, Union Pacific by John Debo Galloway, C.

Owing to the disproportionate demand of the locomotive for water as compared to fuel, tenders were essentially a water tank. The ratio of water to coal consumption was roughtly 7 to 1. Tenders were generally designed so that the fuel and water supply were equivalent. In 1851 Colburn notes that an engine on the Boston and Lowell Railroad consumed 925.6 gallons of water during a 26-mile run. A locomotive during this period could expect 25 miles per cord of wood. A good average capacity for a tender of this period would be 1,000 gallons of water and one cord of wood; it can be seen that both commodities were adequate for about a 25-mile run.\n\n1980 The Architecture and Engineering of Elevated Water Storage Structures: 1870-1940, by Carol Ann Dubie, M.
