        "text": "Time for our Annual Meeting - this year we're celebrating 30 years of grassroots advocacy on behalf of passenger rail in the Northeast. Our pride and joy, the Amtrak Downeaster, will be marking its 17th year of serving Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\nIt will be held at the Holiday Inn By the Bay in downtown Portland on Friday, December 14th, 2018. Those wishing accommodations at the Holiday Inn should call Marketing Director Sally Page for a special low rate (207-775-2311, Ext 2141).\n\nRegistration begins at 11:00 a.m. (both north and southbound trains arrive in Portland before 11:30 a.m.). The meeting opens at 12:30 p.m. and concludes at 3:30 p.m. If you come by train, you'll be bussed to the hotel in time of the buffet luncheon.\n\nOur Keynote Speaker will be Eugene (Gene) Skoropowski, Senior Passenger Rail Consultant, TY Lin International, whose 40 years of railroading experience brought Florida's first privately-funded passenger rail service to fruition. Gene was responsible for establishing Brightline as an operating railroad in Florida, developing the service plan (train operations), selecting the rolling stock (trainsets), designing of the rolling stock maintenance facilities, hiring and training of operating crews (engineers & conductors), projecting operating costs and revenues and preparing the company’s passenger rail operations program. Gene is a long-time friend of TrainRiders/NE and we welcome his insight into the current state of passenger rail in America.\n\nBoth Maine Senator Susan Collins and Stephen Gardner, Executive Vice President of Amtrak, are unable to appear because of conflicting commitments.\n\nNNEPRA Executive Director Patricia Quinn will provide us with the Downeaster's impressive record-breaking numbers from Fiscal Year 2018.\n\nMariah Morales, of Amtrak's Government Affairs team, will fill us in on Amtrak's relationships with coalitions, trade associations and advocacy groups.\n\nMaine DOT Commissioner David Bernhardt, PanAm Railways President David Fink and Executive VP Cynthia Scarano will be our guests as well.\n\nFollowing the meeting at 4 p.m., you are invited to board a bus for a tour of Portland's downtown, waterfront and Deering Oaks Park holiday display. We'll return you to the station in time to catch the train south at 6:15 p.m. or the northbound train at 7:30 p.m.\n\nLest we forget, TrainRiders/NE was responsible for creating the Downeaster in the first place, and we're not finished yet. We're working to expand the rail service to other Maine points. We're planning a connection at North Station to allow us to cross the platform for a train to NEW YORK CITY via Worcester. We've got plenty yet to do in the coming years!\n\nYou can make your Annual Meeting luncheon reservation online as well as renew your membership by going here.\n\nPatricia Quinn, Executive Director of NNEPRA, summarized the current Downeaster service this way: \"It's pretty much a mess.\"\n\nTrack Work:\n\nBy the end of this month, some 276 trains will have been cancelled in FY2015 due to track work. The work to replace some 22,000 ties on the PanAm line has seen 8,750 replaced and another 13,600 remaining. So far, ties have been replaced on 22 miles of track but only three of those miles have been tamped properly for normal speeds. Tamping equipment has been the Achilles heel of this ongoing project. PanAm had sent one of their machines out for rehab in anticipation of a May 1st start - unfortunately, it came back three weeks late! Amtrak has now joined the battle and is supplying a tamper. It had been delayed due to the Philadelphia train wreck.\n\nPerformance Report:\n\nFY2015 to date has been the Downeaster's \"most challenging year yet,\" said Ms. Quinn. Ridership declined as travelers made other transportation plans and as a result, revenue decreased.\n\nOne encouraging statistic comes from the customer satisfaction survey conducted on the Downeaster. Under the cirumstances, the Customer Service Index remains high. The Downeaster rated an 85 overall as compared to Amtrak's 83. Patricia attributed the high score to the quality of the crews and the willingness of most passengers to understand the reality of the current difficult situation. July promises a return to normalcy.\n\nBrunswick Layover Facility\n\nMs. Quinn briefed the board on the latest BLF maneuverings. She reported that the Brunswick Town Council, after extensive debate, took no stand on where the Auxiliary Power Unit should be installed nor the addition of compressed air. The following day, the Joint Transportation Committee in Augusta defeated Sen Gerzofsky's idling bill. The committee did recommend that compressed air be added to the front-end power installation. That unit would cost approximately $70-$80 thousand additional dollars and would have to be funded by the DOT. She reported to the board that the order for the APU had been placed and should be available to reduce engine idling by late July. The board reaffirmed their earlier decision to place the APU at the Church Road end of the proposed layover facility property.\n\nThe DEP decision on the Storm Water Runoff Permit is expected around mid-June.\n\nThe Brunswick Town Council met Monday night to discuss how best to address the idling of Amtrak trains in their community. This was the result of a bill, sponsored by Sen Gerzofsky of Brunswick, that would restrict idling of passenger train engines to 30 minutes. The Legislature's Transportation Committee had tabled that bill requesting that NNEPRA move forward with idling-reduction technology and work with Brunswick on where it would be located.\n\nNNEPRA Executive Director Patricia Quinn told the council that an APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) or plug-in unit had been ordered that very day and would likely take eight to ten weeks for delivery. She also noted that the Maine DOT had budgeted $70 thousand for the unit and its installation. She explained that the APU would not halt all idling as the GE engines monitor themselves and restart when the onboard computer deems it necessary. It would, however, help reduce idling time at temperatures above 45 degrees.\n\nMs. Quinn told the council that the preferred location for the APU would be on NNEPRA's property near Church Road. Two other possible locations, Cedar Street and the Brunswick Station, would interfere with other train traffic and therefore would not be operationally sound.\n\nAfter considerable debate, the council defeated a resolution that would have encouraged NNEPRA to do what it had already done. Several council members expressed the opinion that NNEPRA and Amtrak were best qualified to make such technical decisions. Ms. Quinn added that they were investigating the acquisition of an air compressor to maintain the train's brake pressure and that she would be willing to come back to the council and provide a progress report.\n\nA second proposal on the town council agenda would have recommended that the APU be installed at the train station. Considering that Ms. Quinn had already addressed the operational problems associated with such a suggestion (blocking other train traffic and inspection difficulties), the item was not proposed and the session ended with one moton defeated and the second agenda item not pursued.\n\nWe have a great lineup of guests!\n\nOur keynote speaker is Ross Capon, Transportation Consultant and President Emeritus of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. Ross has testified countless times before Congress on behalf of railroad passengers. He is a member of the Federal Railroad Administration's Railroad Safety Advisory Committee along other federal and rail transportation boards. Ross is a long-time friend of TrainRiders/Northeast can be seen on the Downeaster as he vacations in Maine.\n\nPatricia Quinn, Executive Director of NNEPRA, will bring us up-to-date on the Downeaster's performance and outline the opportunities and challenges ahead. Since assuming NNEPRA's reins in September 2005, Patricia has seen yearly ridership increases since taking the administrative throttle. FY 2014 marked a milestone for the Downeaster, as the 5 million passenger mark was met and exceeded ...thanks, in part, to the successful expansion to Freeport and Brunswick. The year itself was successful with record-breaking ridership exceeding 536,000, which is a 4.6% increase over the previous fiscal year.

She reported that she had a 2 1/2 hour meeting with the Maine DEP addressing in particular the storm water permitting process. As a result, the permit has been resubmitted and notification of the abutters has been expanded. This is a 45-day process that allows for public input. The meeting with the DEP addressed several other issues: the water table, air quality and storage of lubricants on the property. None of those issues was considered a problem.\n\nMs. Quinn met personally with two legislators and talked with a third on the phone regarding their letter suggesting that the layover facility be built in South Portland. She characterized the conversations as productive.\n\nOn the issue of idling at the Brunswick Station, Ms. Quinn stated that she was examining a way to reduce the idling time by shifting the current 12:30p arrival to 3:00p. Also, #687 would be shifted to a 6:05p departure from North Station (currently 5:40p) and become the evening train to Brunswick. We were reminded the the BLF is the solution to multiple issues, including this one.\n\nPerformance Report - Fiscal Year 2014\n\nFrom the NNEPRA report: \"FY 2014 marked a milestone for the Downeaster, as the 5 million passenger mark was met and exceeded. The year itself was successful with record-breaking ridership exceeding 536,000, which is a 4.6% increase over the previous fiscal year. Increases in ticket revenue were even more significant, exceeding $8.6 million, surpassing the previous year by 6.2%. Customer satisfaction for FY2014 was 93 as compared to Amtrak's overall CS of 86.\"\n\nFreeportUSA has sent a letter to Governor LePage regarding the continuing opposition of the Brunswick West Neighborhood Coalition to the location of the Downeaster Layover Facility. FreeportUSA concludes: \"It is vital to our community that Amtrak be able to continue providing our only public transportation service. Our organization is certain that any delay or disruption to service would be harmful to our local businesses, the Town of Freeport and our entire region.\" The full letter is below.\n\n===FreeportUSA Letter===\n\nAugust 19, 2014\n\nDear Governor LePage,\n\nI am writing today on behalf of FreeportUSA, a non-profit destination marketing association that represents more than 155 Freeport businesses. We wish to express our enthusiastic support of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority. The Amtrak Downeaster has had a positive impact on our community, and we encourage you to continue your support of this service that benefits our residents and guests, alike.\n\nFreeport had been without a public transportation option for more than 10 years prior to November 2012. As a favorite Maine destination to more than 3 million annual visitors, our office fielded thousands of calls from not only Boston and New York (where it’s not practical to have a car) but from international visitors who wished to make the trip once they landed. Upon hearing that we could not offer any public transportation options, reactions were always filled with frustration and disbelief. Shortly after Amtrak began service to Freeport, we stopped getting these calls.\n\nThe Amtrak Downeaster has helped increase tourism through marketing campaigns that create compelling media about Freeport as a destination. Additionally, the Downeaster supports tourism by leveraging their marketing funds in support of regional and local efforts. The response to the Downeaster service to Freeport has been positive, exceeding daily average ridership projections by 50%.\n\nThe Downeaster service is an asset to FreeportUSA and important to the future growth of both our organization and community. Last year, they supported Freeport’s Sparkle Celebration by providing two Polar Express-themed train excursions, which FreeportUSA used as a fundraising opportunity and an anchor event in attracting people to Freeport during the holiday shopping season. Special trips were created for Black Friday/Moonlight Madness, resulting in more than 100 shoppers arriving in Freeport between 10 p.m. and 2:30 a.m.\n\nFreeportUSA offices are located at the Freeport Train & Information Center, so we are able to learn firsthand the appreciation that riders have for this service. Residents and guests enjoy the safety, comfort, convenience and economic benefit of train travel. Many Freeport residents regularly use the Amtrak Downeaster as their preferred method to commute/travel to Boston. We frequently hear that the trains heading south to Boston are sold out, and that some travelers have learned it’s always important to purchase their tickets ahead of time. Within our community, Amtrak has helped to alleviate traffic jams and parking shortages.\n\nIt is vital to our community that Amtrak be able to continue providing our only public transportation service. Our organization is certain that any delay or disruption to service would be harmful to our local businesses, the Town of Freeport and our entire region. It is our hope that with your support, the Amtrak Downeaster will not only continue its service uninterrupted, but will be able to expand its schedule to meet the growing demand.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKelly E.

Anyone who has been following this issue for the past two years should find the response of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority's Executive Director, Patricia Quinn informative and refreshing after all of the misinformation and \"noise\" that's been circulated since the FRA issued its \"Finding of No Significant Impact\" and directed the Rail Authority to proceed with the process.\n\nWayne Davis\n\n====Letter from Patricia Quinn of NNEPRA below===\n\nAug. 15 — To the Editor:\n\nThe Letter to the Editor published on seacoastonline.com on Aug. 11 titled, \"Downeaster does not merit $16M investment\" uses distorted data and inaccurate assumptions to challenge not only the construction of a train layover facility in Brunswick, but the merit of Downeaster service and the credibility of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority that manages it. The author, Bob Morrison, lives in the neighborhood adjacent to the railroad in Brunswick, and is chairman of the group opposing the construction of a train layover facility planned to be built in the former rail yard site located across the tracks. As the executive director of NNEPRA, I believe it is important that information regarding the layover project, the Downeaster service and NNEPRA is presented accurately and in proper context.\n\nContrary to Mr. Morrison's accusations, the basic rules of business are at the forefront of every decision made by NNEPRA, including the decision to construct a $12.7 million facility (not a $16 million facility as reported in the editorial) on a site zoned mixed use, industrial railroad corridor, in Brunswick. The Brunswick layover will improve the operational efficiency, cost effectiveness and economic impact of the Amtrak Downeaster service by converting the two non-revenue equipment moves that currently operate between Portland and Brunswick each day to revenue trips between Brunswick and Boston. It will also enhance the safety and efficiency of the layover operation and improve the reliability of the entire service.\n\nThe Downeaster service is one of the most highly regarded in the Amtrak system, based on ridership and revenue growth and customer satisfaction. Currently, 10 Downeaster trains run daily between Portland and Boston, with only four of those trips extending to Freeport and Brunswick. Despite the constraint of limited service, ridership to Freeport and Brunswick is strong, exceeding projections by nearly 50 percent. When the layover is built and equipment moves can be converted to revenue trips, passengers will have more travel options, ridership and revenue will grow, and Mr. Morrison's observation that the schedule needs to be more convenient will be addressed.\n\nFollowing last week's refusal of the Brunswick West Neighborhood Coalition leaders to engage in constructive discussion on agenda items and their disrespectful antics as detailed in our previous article, Executive Director Patricia Quinn concluded that the relationship with Brunswick West Neighborhood Coalition had become unproductive and was a waste of NNEPRA staff time. She then asked the board to provide guidance as to how best to continue its work with the Brunswick community.\n\nBoard members noted that it was important to continue a dialogue with Brunswick citizens, but as NNEPRA moves on to the construction phase, the base of the advisory group needs to be to be broadened and to that end, the following motion was proposed by chairman Martin Eisenstein and unanimously approved.\n\nNNEPRA board of directors redefines the mission of the Brunswick Layover Building Advisory Group and renames the group as follows:\n\nThe Brunswick Layover Building Advisory Group is renamed the Brunswick Layover Advisory Group and its mission is as follows:\n\nThe purpose is to facilitate information exchanges between NNEPRA and the Brunswick community.\n\nThe constitution of the group with be decided by the chair of the board after input from other board members and the Brunswick community at large.\n\nBoard members went on to explain that they are moving from a planning stage to a construction phase, therefore, the issues are different than before and that different levels of public participation are needed.\n\nRobert Morrison of the Brunswick West Neighborhood Coalition said his group would have to decide whether or not they would continue in the new group. Chairman Eisenstein responded that the committee was not set up to determine the location of the facility. \"Members of your group will be invited to participate in the broadened advisory group, with the understanding that we are not debating the location of the site,\" he concluded.\n\nExeccutive Director Patricia Quinn announced that NNEPRA would shortly reapply for the storm run off permit that was invalidated by a Superior Court judge.\n\nThe Layover Advisory Board, created by NNEPRA to work with the opponents of the Brunswick Layover Facility, met last week to discuss the color and lighting of the proposed Downeaster facility. The local paper somehow failed to provide the disturbing specifics of the NIMBY's opposition to the agenda. Here is a letter, sent to the Town Council, by one of the pro-layover West Brunswick residents detailing the rude and disturbing antics employed by the opposition.\n\nJuly 26, 2014\n\nTo: Brunswick Town Councilor Benet Pols\n\nFrom: Jeff Reynolds\n\nRE: Dysfunction of the Layover Advisory Committee\n\nDear Councilor Pols,\n\nOn July 24, 2014, the Layover Advisory Committee met at Council chambers in Brunswick. I attended—and will never forget what I, along with others, witnessed.\n\nAmong the members of the Committee are three citizens who live near the site of the soon-to-be built Downeaster layover and maintenance facility. These citizens also happen to belong to and occupy leadership roles in the Brunswick West Neighborhood Coalition (BWNC). Their names: Dan Sullivan, Chris Casey, Robert Morrison.\n\nIn decades of attending and participating in meetings of various sorts I have never seen behavior such as that exhibited by the aforementioned citizens. They were uniformly rude, insinuating and insulting, insistent on having it their way or no way or at all. It was nothing short of outrageous.[1]\n\nOne brief example will suffice. An engineer for the firm that will build the layover facility gave a PowerPoint presentation on the lighting plan for the site and structure. Images were displayed on the west wall of the Council chamber. This was information of vital import to me as a resident of the neighborhood near the site, and it had been deemed important enough to the BWNC to merit frequent mention in public forums, letters, their website, and more.\n\nThroughout the presentation all three BWNC members faced the east wall, their backs to the speaking podium. Dan Sullivan kept his eyes shut tightly the entire time. Chris Casey and Robert Morrison carried on a conversation so loudly that those of us in the audience had difficulty hearing what the consultant was saying. When the Committee chair asked if the citizen members had any questions or comments pertaining to the lighting plan, Robert Morrison ignored the invitation and instead read a prepared two-page BWNC “position paper” that had nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with lighting or any other agenda item.\n\nAmplify this kind of juvenile meanness for the duration of the meeting and you get an inkling of what occurred. The worst part, however, and the part I want you to keep in mind as you consider future action, occurred when the ostensive purpose of the meeting—to select a color for the building—came up.\n\nThe BWNC members refused to participate, and this after they, like me, had been sent ahead of time by mail, professional, color illustrations of various color schemes and instructions on how to make preferences known through an on-line service. I participated on-line. As a neighborhood resident I looked forward to engaging further in the selection process.\n\nHere’s my point. By refusing to participate in this activity, and through their relentlessly “obstructionary” behavior throughout the meeting, the three members of the BWNC have abrogated their right to represent the residents who live near the Church-Stanwood site. All three must be released from their places on the Committee and replacements found who will participate constructively.\n\nFurthermore, since this facility is of great interest across Brunswick, new appointees ought to be welcomed from all parts of the area, up to and including Freeport.\n\nLastly, members of all Town committees represent Brunswick. They are our public face. In light of their reprehensible behavior at the July 24 meeting, all three citizen members of the Layover Advisory Committee ought to apologize formally, in public, to the other members of that Committee and to Brunswick as a whole.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Reynolds\n\n36 Redwood Lane\n\nBrunswick, ME 04011\n\nCc: Town Councilor John Perreault\n\nTown Councilor John Richardson\n\nMs. Patricia Quinn\n\n[1]. . . and in contrast, the other Committee members were helpful, courteous, and patient beyond the capacities of most of us.\n\n------\n\nHere is the orgininal Forecaster article which failed to mentioned the coalition's disruptive tactics.\n\nA Response to Senator Gerzovsky's\n\nLetter of Complaint to NNEPRA\n\nby Wayne Davis, TrainRiders/NE Chairman\n\n(Editor's Note: Sen.Gerzovksy's letter can be read here.)\n\nMaine Senator Stan Gerzovsky’s letter to NNEPRA strongly opposing the siting of the Brunswick layover facility just south of the current Brunswick station clearly reflects the concerns of some of his constituents who have chosen to live beside the train yard at which the facility will be located. Currently, no indoor layover facility exists in Brunswick, which means that, the Downeaster diesel engines must be kept running to prevent the diesel fuel from congealing and becoming unusable when the temperature is below 40 degrees. Given the Downeaster’s current schedule, at least one Downeaster locomotive must remain idling several hours a day in Brunswick. Idling would not be required if the locomotive could be indoors. The Senator and some of his constituents, however, feel that one of two other proposed sites would be preferable if for no other reason than that they are not located in their backyards. In doing so, the Senator and his constituents both ignore the disadvantage of these other sites and misstate many facts, which include the following:\n\n1. The letter states that the facility will be built near tracks that were “never used-nor ever intended to be used-for this purpose”.\n\nWRONG! The proposed site has been used as a train yard since the mid to late 1800’s. As recently as the 1970’s, the site consisted of numerous rail sidings with a capacity of up to 95 cars and also included a railroad office, a crew quarters, and equipment storage buildings. More importantly, the site has been, and continues to be, zoned for rail and commercial use by the Town of Brunswick, and location of a rail layover facility at this site is consistent not only with applicable zoning requirements, but also with the Town’s comprehensive plan for development. The site has been, and continues to be, a site for interchange of freight trains between the Rockland rail branch operated by the Maine Eastern Railroad, and PanAm Railway’s rail line going south from Brunswick to Portland. A larger version of the postcard from the 1920’s is available online. As one can see, this train yard has historically been very busy. Even today, the site contains numerous active tracks. Those tracks, plus the ongoing activity in the yard and the available uses under applicable zoning requirements, should have shown even very unobservant potential purchasers of nearby residences that the yard was being used, and would continue to be used, for railroad purposes.\n\n2. The letter indicates that the “proposal is to put an industrial-use facility in a residential neighborhood”.\n\nWRONG! For well over a century, the yard has been utilized for rail purposes. The real question is why a residential neighborhood was expanded near what has, for over 100 years, always been an industrial site.\n\n3. The letter indicates that choosing this site for the layover facility is “an irresponsible use of taxpayer money, especially when several alternate sites were proposed that would’ve had a far lesser impact on residents.”\n\nWRONG! Choosing either of the two other sites proposed for the layover facility in Brunswick would itself have been irresponsible. Using the alternate site, located in the Brunswick Industrial Park, would have required filling what is now essentially a huge hole in the ground in an area which included wetlands. The cost of preparing that alternate site would have made the project unaffordable.\n\nUsing the second alternate site, located in the Cook’s Corner area north of downtown Brunswick, would have been inconsistent with Brunswick’s zoning requirements and its Comprehensive Plan. Perhaps more importantly, however, this site is located on non-signaled track which would have required over half an hour of additional travel time for each train between Brunswick station and the layover facility, resulting in several hours’ worth of additional fuel, equipment use, and crew time each day. This, plus other operational shortfalls, would have translated into another unaffordable project. In addition, if this site had been chosen, it would have resulted in added motor vehicle idling time as trains crossed one of the busiest high-volume highway crossings in the state. To have chosen either of the alternative sites would have increased taxpayer costs in significant and adverse ways. Clearly, in choosing the proposed site NNEPRA acted responsibly to minimize taxpayer cost and ensure the survivability of the Downeaster service.\n\n4. The letter indicates that noise and air pollution resulting from idling of trains for upwards of five hours a day will result in decreased property values and increased health risks.\n\nWRONG! Construction of the layover building will eliminate the need for long-term idling of trains since they will be housed indoors at that facility. A study performed for NNEPRA (available at NNEPRA's website, www.amtrakdowneaster.com/projects/brunswick-layover-facility) estimated that even after the service is increased to six roundtrips per day (only two such trips occur now), utilization of the layover building would result in no more than 30 minutes of total idling time each day, and that this idling time would be inside the facility. That same study concluded that health risks and air pollution associated with the service would be insignificant.\n\n5. The letter intimates that NNEPRA’s choice of the proposed site somehow undermines the credibility of government and exacerbates the erosion of faith in how government agencies function.\n\nWRONG! After becoming aware of local opposition to the chosen site, NNEPRA reached out to the community and held three separate public meetings in Brunswick to discuss the potential sites. NNEPRA’s Board of Directors then held a later public meeting at which it accepted the recommendation from its consultants and staff to move forward with the development of the layover facility at the Brunswick rail yard. NNEPRA then formed an advisory group which included several Brunswick residents, representatives from the Town’s government, and others to discuss the facility. NNEPRA went above and beyond both its legal obligations and normal practice to ensure that the positions of all parties were presented and considered. That NNEPRA, its consultants, and its staff did not finally agree with those who opposed the chosen site does not constitute a failure of government or in any way; instead, it only means that NNEPRA, after due consideration of all the facts, disagreed with Senator Gerzovsky and those of his constituents who objected to having the layover facility cited in what they considered to be their back yards.\n\nNNEPRA took several years, and invested much time, money, and energy, in carefully choosing the rail yard site for the layover facility. To disagree with that choice is certainly the right and privilege of every citizen, be they elected officials or merely interested parties. To base that opposition upon misstatements, however, serves no one and did not and cannot aid anyone in making an appropriate decision. The misstatements contained in the Senator’s letter are so significant and numerous that it adds nothing relevant or appropriate to the discussions about this facility. Instead, it would appear that NNEPRA’s careful consideration of the matter has resulted in a choice which, on balance, is beneficial not only to Mainers, but also to all others who use or will otherwise benefit from Downeaster service to Brunswick, including those constituents of Senator Gerzovsky who live near the chosen site. Introduction of the misstatements contained in the Senator’s letter seems to be the product of Not-In-My-Back-Yardism at its worst.\n\n{jcomments on}"
