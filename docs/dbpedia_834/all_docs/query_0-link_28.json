        "text": "Railroad history is one of my hobbies and somewhat of a passion. Like some people have favorite sports teams, I have favorite railroads, all of which are fallen-flags, i.e., they no longer exist.\n\nConrail grew out of the ashes of the largest bankruptcy at the time involving the Penn Central Transportation Company (formed by the ill-fated merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad (reporting marks PRR) and the New York Central Railroad (reporting marks NYC), and subsequently the New York, New Haven and Hartford (NH) Railroad).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Central_Transportation_Company\n\nInteresting story - Daughen, Joseph R. & Peter Binzen (1999). The Wreck of the Penn Central (2nd edition). Boston: Beard Books Little, Brown. ISBN 1-893122-08-5.\n\nAnyway, Conrail was a government-owned corporation until 1987, when it was privatized. \"The Federal Government created Conrail to take over the potentially-profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers, including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway. After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act, Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987. The two remaining Class I railroads in the East, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts (alongside three residual shared-assets areas), returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central. Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board, CSX and NS took control in August 1998, and on June 1, 1999, began operating their respective portions of Conrail.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrail\n\nRecently, I've encountered Conrail Shared Assets trains, and I didn't quite understand it, and then I discovered Conrail Shared Assets Operations.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrail_Shared_Assets_Operations\n\nhttps://www.conrail.com/system-map/\n\nCSX is perhaps the weaker of the two partners. Recently, CSX has agreed to buy Pan Am Railways in New England. Pan Am is what used to be the Guilford Rail System, itself a combination of the Boston & Maine, Maine Central, Portland Terminal Company and Springfield Terminal Railway.\n\nhttps://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about...sx-to-acquire-pan-am-railways-in-new-england/\n\nhttps://www.railwayage.com/regulatory/definitive-csx-acquiring-pan-am-railways/\n\nThe CSX acquisition is complicated by the interest that Norfolk Southern (NS) has in the Pan Am Southern system.\n\nRailroads are complicated legal entities, since they are both a transportation and real estate company. Current Class I railroads are the result of many mergers over the passed 60 years, and even the main (Class I) railroads were complicated mergers and acquisitions so smaller entities over the past 180 years. One has to go back to state and federal charters and grants to find out how complex railroads are as corporations.\n\nBackground on many current and historical railroads can be found at - https://www.american-rails.com/\n\nCALGARY — Canadian Pacific will buy Kansas City Southern in a cash and stock transaction worth approximately $29 billion, CP has confirmed. Financial Times first reported the story Saturday night.\n\nIn an announcement posted Sunday morning, CP said the deal has the approval of both boards of directors, and confirms the previously reported price valuing KCS at $275 per share, representing a 23% premium on KCS’s closing stock price on Friday.\n\nhttps://www.trains.com/trn/news-rev...to-buy-kansas-city-southern-news-report-says/\n\nhttps://www.trains.com/trn/canadian...uthern-merger-to-redraw-class-i-railroad-map/\n\nThere are now 7 Class I railroads in the US, but there will be only 6 once CP takes control of KCS.\n\nAs of 2016, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) defines a Class I as having operating revenues of, or exceeding, $453 million annually.\n\nhttps://www.american-rails.com/class.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_classes\n\nhttps://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview\n\nCP's larger Canadian rival, Canadian National (CN) acquired the old Illinois Central Gulf back in 1996-1998, and fully integrated it in 1999.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-11-9802110374-story.htmlUpdate:\n\nBig Railroad Deal Seen More Likely to Gain Regulators' OK\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-03-22/big-railroad-deal-seen-more-likely-to-gain-regulators-ok\n\nCanadian Pacific’s proposed $25 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern would be the first major railroad merger since the 1990s, but analysts say this deal has a better chance of success than past failed ones because there is little overlap between the two railroads.\n\nIt's basically an end-to-end merger at Kansas City, Mo, with KCS serving south to Louisiana, Texas and Mexico, and CP serving north up to Canada.\n\nAstronuc said:\n\nRailroad history is one of my hobbies and somewhat of a passion. Like some people have favorite sports teams, I have favorite railroads, all of which are fallen-flags, i.e., they no longer exist.\n\nIn the late 1970's, I several times joyfully rode the Southern Crescent round trip to DC from Charlottesville. It would roll through Charlottesville at 6 am : and get you to DC in time to do a day's business while it went on to NYC. The return south left DC at 5:00pm(?) so I could eat fried chicken and peas (served on linen tablecloths with real cutlery) while passing frustrated rush hour drivers at every crossing. That was fabulous fun. Of course the wait staff was almost entirely elderly black men and the experience was clearly borrowed from a different and not entirely idyllic era. But it is a lovely memory. It went Amtrak shortly there after\n\nYears ago, I loved taking the train from Schenectady to NYC. It was a scenic ride on some spots and then a desolate ride as you entered NYC. Grand Central was an amazing place and it was easy to get lost trying to find the right subway platform.\n\nIt was also a good time to read a book, since there were no iPods, iPhones, or iPads around. Transistor radios would have to be retuned as you lost stations. But the book remained as the best source of long term distraction.\n\nThe one downside for me was the train always took a break in Albany for 30 to 40 minutes and you felt you were never getting to where you wanted to go. Later, I would drive to Albany and take the train from there to skip that time.\n\nKansas City Southern in talks on dueling rail takeover bids\n\nAs deal talks begin, Canadian National railroad says it is receiving broad support for its $33.7 billion bid to buy Kansas City Southern\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Business/wir...ern-talks-dueling-rail-takeover-bids-77320144\n\nCN's north-south line, the old Illinois Central Gulf (ICG) is parallel with KCS and is somewhat redundant. Geographically, the CP-KCS merger makes more sense, as it would provide more competition.\n\nCN is Canada's largest railway, in terms of both revenue and the physical size of its rail network, spanning Canada from the Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia to the Pacific coast in British Columbia across approximately 20,400 route miles (32,831 km) of track.[1] In the late 20th century, CN gained extensive capacity in the United States by taking over such railroads as the Illinois Central. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway)\n\nhttps://www.cn.ca/en/our-services/maps-and-network/\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) (reporting marks CP, CPAA, MILW, SOO), known as CP Rail between 1968 and 1996 and simply Canadian Pacific, is a historic Canadian Class I railway incorporated in 1881. The railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, it owns approximately 20,100 kilometres (12,500 mi) of track in six provinces of Canada and into the United States, stretching from Montreal to Vancouver, and as far north as Edmonton. Its rail network also serves Minneapolis–St. Paul, Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, and Albany, New York in the United States. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway)\n\nCP took over Soo Line (SOO), which had taken over remnants of the bankrupt Milwaukee Road (MILW). CP had also taken over the former Delaware & Hudson (DH) in New York, and operates it as part of Soo Line. The old D&H had been part of Guilford Transportation Industries.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soo_Line_Railroad\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_and_Hudson_Railway\n\nJean-Jacques Ruest and Patrick Ottensmeyer, CEOs of CN and KCS, respectively\n\nRail merger is a key to economic growth, supply chain security\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/rail-merger-is-a-key-to-economic-growth-supply-chain-security/ar-AALoVMM?li=BBnb7Kz\n\nThe headline is an overstatement. They can already do runthroughs, which railroads did before end-to-end mergers. A merger of KCS with CP would do the same.\n\nCN operates from the Canadian border to New Orleans via the old Illinois Central Gulf (a merger between Illinois Central and Gulf, Mobile and Ohio). KCS runs parallel with the ICG line for much of the distance.\n\nCN is interested in a seamless (under one company) line between Canada and Mexico through the gateway which KCS in Texas would provide.\n\nIf successful, the CN-KCS combined network would help relieve the chronic shortages of long-haul truck drivers and reduce the carbon footprint of long-haul truck traffic heading up and down Interstates 35, 55 and 94 between Mexico, Texas and the Midwest.\n\nThat could be happening now. It hasn't happened.\n\nWe have calculated that for a single route, from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, to Detroit, Mich., moving freight from trucks to trains would save 260,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of the average annual emissions of more than 300 long-haul trucks. Multiply that across multiple routes and years, and the impact would be significant.\n\nThis is true, IF shippers move to rail transport from truck. This doesn't require a merger - just good economic practice.\n\nCN's proposal - https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/\n\nWASHINGTON — For the third time since February, CSX Transportation has filed an application with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to acquire New England’s Pan Am Railways.\n\nOn Friday, the railroad announced it had submitted an “amended and supplemented application” to the STB in an effort to convince the federal regulator that the proposed transaction would be good for shippers and passengers alike. CSX first submitted its plan to acquire Pan Am back in February but a month later it was rejected after the board deemed it would be a “significant” transaction. In April, CSX filed a 478-page amended application. But in May, the board said that was not enough either and that the new application didn’t have a “market analysis” looking at how the deal might impact the New England rail network.\n\nOn the same day that CSX submitted its revised application to the STB, it also launched a new website, nefreightrail.com, to convince the public of the merits of the combination.\n\nhttps://railfan.com/third-times-a-charm-csx-tries-again-to-acquire-pan-am/\n\nLate last year, CSX announced that it would purchase Pan Am for an undisclosed amount of money. As part of the proposed plan, Genesee & Wyoming would operate Pan Am Southern — a joint venture between Pan Am and Norfolk Southern — and NS will get trackage rights over CSX’s Boston Line so that it can move double-stack trains to Ayer, Mass. The new G&W line would be called Berkshire & Eastern. CSX would operate the railroad east of Ayer, Mass., into New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nAyer, MA is ENE/NE of Boston between Fitchburg and Lowell. The line between Boston and Albany used to be a mainline of the old Boston & Maine (BM) Railroad, which ran more or less parallel (and in competition) with the Boston & Albany (BA) Railroad, which ran through the southern part of Massachusetts. BM was folded into the Guilford System during 1983, and Guilford Transportation was rebranded Pan Am Railways in March 2006.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_and_Maine_Corporation\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_and_Albany_Railroad\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Railways\n\nhttps://www.ayer.ma.us/edc/railroads/pages/new-england-freight-railroad-hub\n\nI have told this many times, probably here as well, but my dad ran away from home in about 1906 and joined first the circus and then the railroad, probably the L&N, Louisville and Nashville. He was once stalked on his train by an infamous local gunman seeking revenge for his witness testimony in a trial. My dad got behind the gunman but sympathetically called out to him rather than shoot him in the back, which was a nearly fatal choice. The gunman got off the first shot but my dad was more accurate, at least wounding his assailant and knocking him off the train. At his death, my dad unfortunately left unfinished his intended book \"Fifty years on the railroad\".\n\nI try to attach a photo of him in about 1910-1920 in front of one of the circus wagons. This looks like a horse drawn wagon although I assumed the fact that circuses traveled by train was the entree for my dad to that life.\n\nAttachments\n\nJardSmith1915.jpeg\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. – Kansas City Southern is inching toward making Canadian Pacific its merger partner.\n\nhttps://www.trains.com/trn/news-rev...ard-a-merger-agreement-with-canadian-pacific/\n\nKCS said today that it will begin merger discussions with CP after its board unanimously determined that CP’s Aug. 10 bid could be deemed superior to the agreement it reached with Canadian National in May.\n\nThe U.S. Surface Transportation Board’s Aug. 31 ruling that denied CN’s request to put KCS into an independent voting trust threw a monkey wrench into a proposed CN-KCS merger. The board’s ruling also set a high bar for Class I mergers – except for a tie-up involving CP and KCS, whose voting trust proposal received the STB’s blessing in May.\n\nAbout the only way for the CN-KCS merger to work from a regulatory standpoint (i.e., competition) would be for CN to cede the old Illinois Central (IC, formerly Illinois Central Gulf, formed by merger of old IC and Gulf, Mobile and Ohio (GM&O)) to CP. Canadian National Railway acquired control of the IC in 1998.\n\nOn August 10, 1972, the Illinois Central Railroad merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad to form the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (reporting mark ICG).\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad#Illinois_Central_Gulf_Railroad_(1972–1988)\n\nAt the end of 1980 ICG operated 8,366 miles of railroad on 13,532 miles of track; that year it reported 33,276 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 323 million passenger-miles. Later in that decade, the railroad spun off most of its east–west lines and many of its redundant north–south lines, including much of the former GM&O. Most of these lines were bought by other railroads, including entirely new railroads such as the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway, Paducah and Louisville Railway, Chicago Central and Pacific Railroad and MidSouth Rail Corporation.\n\nIn 1988 the railroad's then-parent company IC Industries spun off its remaining rail assets and changed its name to the Whitman Corporation.\n\n. . .\n\nOn February 29, 1988, the newly separated ICG dropped the \"Gulf\" from its name and again became the Illinois Central Railroad.\n\nWith the consolidation of the Class I railroads, there has been some consideration/speculation of a final round, e.g, UP+NS and BNSF+CSX, leaving two main Class Is, besides the Canadian-based CN and CP. That would leave all the regional and shortline roads, which operate what were marginal lines/operations of the old, now defunct Class Is."
