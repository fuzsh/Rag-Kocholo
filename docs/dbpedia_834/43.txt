This station is the out of use rail station of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, a historic railroad that operated in Massachusetts. It was one of the first railroads in North America and the first major one in the state. The line later operated as part of the Boston and Maine Railroad's Southern Division. This station became a cinema during the mid 20th century, but was out of use and run down by the end of the century. However, Lowell National Historical Park has recently renovated the station.

Middlesex Community College has now acquired the building from the National Park Service and plans to use it as an arts center and theater for the college.
