Central Asian Turkish nomads begin to move into the power vaccum left by the crumbling easy-going Muslim Abbasid Empire, and the Muslim fundamentalist Berber Murabitun Almoravids in North Africa begin to move in from the other side, while the Christians keep reclaiming Muslim Spain acre by acre from both, and the Shiite Fatimids of North Africa are the Muslim wild card? The PC Norse Normans are the Christian wild card, taking England while flirting with Muslims and sacking Rome? A good century to be excommunicated?\n\nThe First Decade of the 11th Century (10-Zeds) (1000-1009 C.E.)\n\nThe Henry the Saint, Stephen the Saint, Anything the Saint Decade?

A third of world Christians still live in Asia, and a tenth in Africa; by the end of the 14th cent. they are virtually wiped out by Islamic persecution. The original myth of the female orgasm? This was the last year of the 10th cent. in the Julian Calendar as well as the last year of the first millennium, and was a leap year starting on Mon.; the papal chancery now dated all documents using the Anno Domini (A.D./B.C.) system for the Julian Calendar - perhaps they now can't cover up that the world has a long future ahead of it before (if ever) he comes baaack, but don't want the world to regress to the pagan state that existed before he arrived?
