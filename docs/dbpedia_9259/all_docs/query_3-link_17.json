        "text": "The purpose of this thesis work is to investigate the cultural legacy of the al-Andalus period and its reception in contemporary Spain. To fulfill the research objective set, it was necessary to answer the following questions: How important is this period in the history of Spain? How much of its influence can be noticed today? How much historical and cultural knowledge do the Spanish have on this subject? The answers to these questions result from the analysis of an extensive source database and the realization of a series of semi-structured interviews with Spaniards, which were necessary to understand and develop the subject. The work is divided into three sections: the first describes the history of al-Andalus and some additional aspects of interest, such as the etymology and the idea of the myth of al-Andalus. In the next section, the topic of the Muslim legacy remained on the Iberian Peninsula is developed. It describes cities important during the Muslim rule, their architecture and well-known monuments, as well as visible influence in the following areas: language, music, literature and cuisine. The last part focuses more on practical aspects: it is based on interviews with Spaniards and it analyzes their attitude towards all the issues raised in the theoretical parts. The greatest number of conclusions can be derived from the research described in empirical chapter. According to the collected information, the Arab legacy in Spain is extensive and rooted in Spanish culture for so long that without its presence, Spain, as we know today, would not be the same. It may seem that more than 800 years (8th – 15th) of developing the Arab culture in Spain has still been very much alive, because this cultural legacy continues to be extremely impactful in areas such as: tourism, economy and social coexistence of different groups (convivencia).\n\nMadīnat Ilbīra was one of the most splendid towns in Muslim al-Andalus and the centre of one of administrative units (the kūra of Ilbīra) of the Caliphate of Cόrdoba. Already in the Middle Ages the town was depopulated and fell into ruin. In 2001-2011 and 2016-2019 two archaeological research projects have been conducted to confirm the location of remains of Madīnat Ilbīra at the foot of the Sierra Elvira mountains, as well as to solve the main problems related to its history. The paper presents the crucial achievements of archaeology, confronted with written records. The authors formulate hypotheses concerning origin and chronology of the town, its spatial arrangement, social topography, and also religious structure of the inhabitants. One of the important issue is also the problem of the fall of Madīnat Ilbīra and relocation of the economic centre of the region to the city of Granada."
