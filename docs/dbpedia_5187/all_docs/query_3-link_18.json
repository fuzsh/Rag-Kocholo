        "text": "Traditional Food and Drink of Lesotho\n\nThe people of Lesotho have a traditional diet consisting of food items such as maize, millet, melons, pumpkins, peas, beans and ground nuts. They have also traditionally domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and fowl. Here are some traditional dishes to look out for when you are in Lesotho.\n\nLekhotloane (pounded beef) is a very popular traditional meat dish made for most special occasions. It is cooked in a three-legged iron pot, simmered until soft, with only salt and water. It is usually prepared using beef and it is a staple at most traditional occasions such as funerals and weddings.\n\nLeribe / Likahare is made of intestines, and some inside parts of goat, sheep or cow, which are cooked until soft.\n\nMotoho is a stiff sorghum porridge. It is typically eaten with sides of indigenous greens along with goat, beef or chicken meat. Sometimes the sorghum is fermented before cooking.\n\nSimilar to motoho is Papa, which is made of ground maize.\n\nBread flour is not part of the indigenous diet of Lesotho, but there are various bread recipes that have become part of the country’s national cuisine. The most common are Maqebekoane (steamed dumplings), Makoenya (deep fried fat cakes), Liphaphatha (pot-roasted wheat bread), and Bohobe ba Polata (baked bread) which is cooked in pitsa ea polata (a flat cast iron pot) using hot coals.\n\nTlhapi - a must-try local speciality is trout, which is farmed extensively in the highlands, and is usually served as a whole grilled fish.\n\nLebese is fermented milk which is eaten on its own or added to porridge.\n\nKhemere is a hugely popular homemade non-alcoholic ginger beer, popular at weddings and other festivities.\n\nJoala ba Sesotho (traditional beer) is brewed from fermented sorghum or millet seeds. A commercially produced and packaged beer, Chibuku, brewed from either maize or sorghum, is a favourite drink across southern Africa, and enjoyed particularly in the villages and towns.\n\nMaluti is the most popular brand of commercially brewed local beer in Lesotho. It is a light-tasting medium-alcohol lager.\n\nTransportation\n\nMaseru Moshoeshoe International Airport serves Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. The airport is located 18km southeast of the city in the town of Mazenod. Flights into Maseru connect via Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nThe border between Lesotho and South Africa is 909 kilometres and there are a number of landborders, including:\n\nMaseru Bridge\n\nPeka Bridge\n\nFicksburg Bridge\n\nCaledonspoort\n\nMonantsa Pass\n\nSani Pass\n\nBoesmansnek\n\nRamatsilitso\n\nQacha’s Nek\n\nOngeluksnek\n\nTele Bridge\n\nMakhaleng Bridge\n\nSepapu’s Gate\n\nVan Rooyen’s Gate\n\nSome border crossings are open 24 hours while others open 06h00 and close at 22:00. Not all border crossings have tarred roads.\n\nDriving in Lesotho is probably the best way to see the country. You can drive using an International Driving Permit for up to 90 days. If you intend to stay longer, you should apply for a Lesotho driving license.\n\nThe quality of roads in Lesotho varies and many roads are not tarred, so you should be careful when driving. It is generally advised to travel in a 4x4 vehicle as the terrain may be harder to navigate and maneuver. The standard of driving can be lower than in most Western countries, and many drivers ignore road safety rules. Dangerous driving, including speeding and drunk driving cause frequent serious and often fatal accidents.\n\nDriving outside the major urban areas can also be dangerous due to wildlife and stray livestock, as well as rocks that have fallen onto the roads and in winter, black ice. This is a particular risk at night, so take extra care if you are driving after dark.\n\nPaper maps can be outdated and Google Maps may not always be available, so familiarise yourself with where you are going before you leave and get to know some of the village names between your destinations.\n\nIn major towns, taxis are generally safe to use. You should agree a price before setting off.\n\nBuses connect most towns and villages with the major cities. They do not always run according to a time schedule, and often delay departing until they have a decent number of passengers.\n\nHealth\n\nHealth care services in Lesotho are delivered primarily by the government and the Christian Health Association of Lesotho. Access to health services is difficult for many people, especially in rural areas, due to their remote location far from hospitals. Patients are therefore not always able to receive help immediately in emergencies.\n\nThe country’s health system is challenged by the relentless increase of the burden of disease brought about by AIDS, and a lack of expertise and human resources. Serious emergencies are often referred to neighbouring South Africa.\n\nDespite these limitations, Lesotho has remained committed to improving the well-being of its citizens. Partnerships with private companies, expansions to the hospital network and increased government funding to aid programs have all been policies implemented to invest in Lesotho’s health infrastructure.\n\nLife expectancy in Lesotho averages around 53 years for both males and females and deaths under 5 occur 8.1% of the time. These five facts about healthcare in Lesotho are integral to understanding the country’s changing health structures and transition out of poverty.\n\nBefore traveling to Lesotho, you should consult your doctor and ensure that your routine vaccines are up to date. Hepatitis A and Tetanus vaccinations are usually advised, along with Hepatitis B, Rabies and Typhoid vaccinations.\n\nMalaria is not normally present in Lesotho unless the illness was contracted abroad.\n\nBe mindful to protect yourself against sunstroke, snake bites, tick-bite fever, Sleeping Sickness and Bilharzia.\n\nKey Attractions\n\nTsehlanyane National Park\n\nTsehlanyane is located in the southern Maluti Mountains, 150km northeast of Maseru. The national park is considered to be Lesotho’s most accessible park, and it is known for its rugged montane vistas, rich sub-Alpine floral diversity, stunning waterfalls, diverse birdlife and an excellent network of hiking and horseback trails.\n\nSemonkong\n\nSituated in the Thaba Putsoa (‘Blue Mountains’) about 115km southeast of Maseru, Semonkong (‘Place of Smoke’) is a small highland town whose name comes from the spectacular cloud of spray thrown up by the nearby Maletsunyane waterfall when it is in full flow. The falls are possibly the best-known natural feature in Lesotho and they stand as one of Africa’s tallest single-drop waterfalls, plummeting 192 metres into a narrow gorge hemmed by steep green slopes and sandstone cliffs.\n\nHa Kome Cave Dwellings\n\nThe Ha Kome Cave Village is situated in Berea district. Once home to the San as evidenced by the faded cave paintings, the cave was in more recent history the hideout place for the Basia and Bataung clans during the Lifaqane wars brought about by Shaka Zulu’s reign. The cave is still inhabited by their descendants to this day.\n\nSehlabathebe National Park\n\nEstablished in 1970 as Lesotho’s first national park, the remote and scenic Sehlabathebe National Park protects 65 square kilometres of grassland set below the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg escarpment, running along the border with South Africa. Due to its altitute, it is one of the most isolated and dramatic national parks to be found anywhere in southern Africa. The park was given UNESCO World Heritage status in 2008, and it is one of only two World Heritage Sites in sub-equatorial Africa to be classified as mixed, which means it is recognised for its cultural significance, from the abundance of prehistoric rock art, as well as its diverse natural gifts.\n\nKatse Dam\n\nKatse Dam is the second largest double curvature arch dam in Africa, constructed in the early 1990s. At 710 metres long and 185 metres high, it impounds a deep reservoir that runs more than 30km along the Malibamatso river when full. A highlight when visiting the dam is Katse Botanical Garden, which was established in 1995 as a sanctuary for Afro-Alpine flora rescued from the land that was soon to be submerged by the reservoir. The garden stands at an altitude of 2,230 metres, making it the highest botanical garden in the southern hemisphere, and it extends across 17 hectares of land.\n\nThaba-Bosiu\n\nThaba-Bosiu lies at the historic and spiritual heart of the Sotho Kingdom. Located 20km east of Maseru and rising to an altitude of 1,800 metres, this near-impregnable sandstone plateau served as the residence and military stronghold of King Moshoeshoe I, the kingdom’s founding father, throughout most of his mid-19th century reign. Moshoeshoe arrived there with his people in the midst of the Lifaqane wars initiated by Shaka Zulu and was quick to recognise its strength as a natural fortress. The expansive flat-topped summit is protected on all sides by formidable sandstone cliffs, yet it is watered by half a dozen natural springs and was large enough to hold plenty of livestock and other provisions during an extended siege. As a result, though Thaba Bosiu was attacked on several occasions in the mid-19th century, by both African and European foes, it was never captured and would be abandoned in favour of Maseru only after Moshoeshoe’s death in 1870."
