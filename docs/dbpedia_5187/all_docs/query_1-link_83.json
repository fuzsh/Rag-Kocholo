        "text": "The Government of Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. The Prime Minister, who is the Executive Authority, leads the Government. The King serves more as a ceremonial icon and does not actively participate in political initiatives. The National Assembly is the lower house of parliament which is controlled by the coalition of parties, namely; All Basotho Convention (ABC), Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and Basutoland National Party (BNP). The Assembly represents Democratic Congress (DC), National Independent Party, Lesotho Workers Party and other minority parties. The upper house of parliament, called the Senate, is composed of 22 Principal Chiefs whose membership is hereditary, and 11 appointees of the King.\n\nDay Date\n\nNew Year’s Day Wednesday 01 January 2014\n\nMoshoeshoe’s Day Tuesday 11 March 2014\n\nGood Friday Friday 18 April 2014\n\nEaster Monday Monday 21 April 2014\n\nWorker's Day Thursday 01 May 2014\n\nAfrica/Heroes Day Sunday 25 May 2014\n\nAscension Day Thursday 29 May 2014\n\nKing’s Birthday Thursday 17 July 2014\n\nIndependence Day Saturday 04 October 2014\n\nChristmas Day Thursday 25 December 2014\n\nBoxing Day Friday 26 December 2014\n\nNote: Public holidays falling on a Sunday do not become a public holiday on the following Monday\n\nThe Loti, denoted by LSL, is the official currency of the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Loti (plural “maloti)”, is divided into 100 lisente (singular “sente”). The LSL is pegged to the South African Rand on a 1:1 basis and both currencies are considered legal tender within Lesotho. Coins in circulation include 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 lisente. Banknotes in circulation include 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 maloti. The import and export of the local currency is unrestricted.\n\nThe economy of Lesotho is divided into 3; primary, secondary and tertiary sector. The primary sector comprises of agriculture and mining and quarrying sectors. Activity in the agriculture sector is mainly at the subsistence level and efforts to commercialize the sub sector have been intensified. The mining and quarrying sector, (which is mainly sandstone and diamonds) has shown potential for growth since 2005 and has been increasing significantly until 2011. The limited growth to date has been due to some refurbishment of equipment by one of the three mining companies and a decline in the existing production. The secondary sector comprises of manufacturing, building and construction. Manufacturing sector surpassed the Government as the largest employer in 2012 and its contribution to GDP is significant. Building and construction is one sector that has currently shown potential for better performance. Private sector is actively participating in this sector and it provides a good platform for promoting property development to support industrial development. Lastly, the tertiary sector which comprises of the retail sector, telecommunications, real estate and government is another significant contributor to GDP. In telecommunications, an increase in the number of service providers brought about expansion of products, access to services and better service delivery. The rest of the components have been increasing consistently.\n\nLesotho’s GDP growth rate has been increasing consistently from 2002 until 2009 when the impact of the economic crisis began to be felt. The growth rate picked up in 2010 but experienced a further decline in 2011 when the effects of the euro crisis hit hard on world economies. The outlook for Lesotho in 2014 and 2015 remains moderately positive with average growth of 4.4% expected; though there are risks over global demand for diamonds and the renewal of the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act which runs out in 2015. The economy is estimated to have grown by 3.4% in 2013, well below the strong 6.5% recorded in 2012. Growth was supported by booming construction activities, a strong recovery by textile and clothing, transport and communications, and financial intermediation.\n\nLesotho’s GDP per capita growth has been estimated to increase from 2.3% in 2013 with an average projection of 3.2% in the next two years. Lesotho’s GDP per capita growth has been growing consistent over time except for the periods when it was hit by the global economic and euro crises.\n\nPrime lending interest rates have remained stable over the year 2013 to February 2014 at around 9.9 percent having come down from around 12.0 percent in the last three years.\n\nFollowing the recent global financial crisis, lending rates have remained relatively attractive for private sector borrowing and investment.\n\nInflation in Lesotho rose slightly in 2012 to 6.7% and went down to 5% in 2013. Inflationary pressures continued to build up during the second quarter of 2014, with consumer inflation reaching a peak of 6.7 per cent in May 2014 and moderating slightly to 6.5 per cent in June. It was initially forecast to average 4.9% in 2014, but has been revised to 6.6% over the medium term."
