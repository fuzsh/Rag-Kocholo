        "text": "The tiny, mountainous country of Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa—it is an enclave. The River Caledon runs along its northern border, while the Orange River winds its way across the southern plateau. These two rivers provide Lesotho’s most important natural resources: water and hydropower. Lesotho has a rugged, upland landscape. Because the altitude is so high, the climate in Lesotho is cool and continental. Summers are hot and dry, while winters can be cold and snowy. Sometimes temperatures in the highlands fall as low as -10°C (14°F)."
