        "text": "Safety and security\n\nCrime\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs and is prevalent in urban areas.\n\nBe cautious when out in public places, especially at night\n\nEnsure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times\n\nKeep valuables with you in your carry-on when travelling and ensure it is secure at all times\n\nStay in hotels or accommodations offering good security measures\n\nViolent crime\n\nViolent crime, such as armed robbery and residential break-ins, occurs and often targets foreigners. Hotspots include:\n\npopular restaurants\n\nlocal hotels\n\nthe business district\n\npoorly lit or unlit roads\n\nCrime is most prevalent in urban areas such as:\n\nMaseru\n\nLeribe\n\nMaputsoe\n\nHowever, incidents have occurred in remote mountainous areas as well.\n\nCarjacking also occurs.\n\nDon’t drive after dark\n\nAlways lock windows and doors\n\nDon’t offer rides to hitchhikers\n\nBe vigilant when stopping at scenic points or rest stations\n\nPark in well-lit areas\n\nThere is no visible police presence at night. Remain vigilant at all times\n\nExercise increased caution in urban centres\n\nDon’t walk alone, especially at night\n\nIf attacked or robbed, do not resist\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country.\n\nThe roads in the capital, Maseru, are adequate, as well as the roads leading to the airport and industrial areas. The roads leading to the Lesotho–South Africa border crossings and most of Lesotho’s district capitals are also in good condition. Aggressive and unpredictable local driving habits pose a risk in Maseru.\n\nThe roads linking rural communities are gravel and poorly maintained. They are poorly lit, and wandering livestock pose a risk to drivers. Some of these rural communities, mainly those in the mountainous areas, are only connected by dirt roads. You may need a four-wheel drive vehicle in those areas. You must also have such a vehicle to enter and depart Lesotho through the Sani Pass on the eastern border.\n\nTourist facilities are limited in Lesotho. There are few gas stations outside of cities and large towns, and no roadside assistance services operating throughout the country.\n\nWeather conditions can change rapidly in mountainous regions. Even in the summer, it can become cold unexpectedly.\n\nPlan your travel accordingly\n\nAlways carry a cell phone and charger\n\nCarry a blanket, warm clothes and a flashlight in case of snowfall or vehicle breakdown in mountain areas\n\nContact the Lesotho Mounted Police Service in case of road emergencies\n\nPublic transportation\n\nBus and taxis\n\nAlthough public bus and taxi services exist, poor vehicle maintenance, overcrowding and lack of driver training make them unsafe. Accidents occur regularly.\n\nThe best way to travel is by private car.\n\nRenting a car\n\nCar rental services are available in Maseru. If you rent a car in South Africa, you may bring it into Lesotho with a letter of authorization from the rental company.\n\nCheck with the rental company to make sure they issue letters of authorization.\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations take place from time to time. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nHiking and camping\n\nAlthough hiking is a popular activity in Lesotho, there are no set hiking trails.\n\nGiven the country’s high altitude, mountaintop campsites will expose you to extreme weather, such as thunderstorms. Unpredictable rainfall can lead to flash floods in the valleys and flooding around rivers. Choose your campsite wisely. There is no reliable mountain rescue service in Lesotho.\n\nIf you intend to hike:\n\nnever do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company\n\nbuy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation\n\nensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity\n\nensure that you’re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard\n\ninform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp\n\nknow the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal\n\nWomen’s Safety\n\nWomen travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nEntry and exit requirements\n\nEvery country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.\n\nWe have obtained the information on this page from the authorities of Lesotho. It can, however, change at any time.\n\nVerify this information with the Foreign Representatives in Canada.\n\nPassport\n\nEntry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.\n\nBefore you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.\n\nRegular Canadian passport\n\nYour passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Lesotho.\n\nPassport for official travel\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply.\n\nOfficial travel\n\nPassport with “X” gender identifier\n\nWhile the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.\n\nOther travel documents\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.\n\nUseful links\n\nForeign Representatives in Canada\n\nCanadian passports\n\nVisas\n\nTourist visa: not required for stays up to 30 days\n\nTemporary residence permit: required for stays longer than 44 days\n\nWork permit: required\n\nStudy permit: required\n\nIf you want to stay longer than 30 days, you can apply for an extension with the Lesotho immigration authorities. You must apply for an extension before the end of the initial 14 days.\n\nHealth screening\n\nDue to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in neighbouring countries, you may be subject to a quick thermal scanner screening and a health questionnaire at the airport upon arrival or departure.\n\nChildren and travel\n\nLearn more about travelling with children.\n\nYellow fever\n\nLearn about potential entry requirements related to yellow fever (vaccines section).\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is not required to enter this country.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by an animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. Rabies treatment is often available in this destination.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).\n\nHigh risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nGood health care is limited in availability.\n\nOutside of Maseru, healthcare is inadequate. Ambulance service is unreliable or non-existent. You will usually need to pay cash for medical care.\n\nYou may need medical evacuation to South Africa in the event of an accident or serious illness. The closest facilities are in Bloemfontein, South Africa, 140 km from Maseru. Should an evacuation be necessary, you may have to arrange your own transport, unless it’s specifically covered by your insurance policy.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres."
