        "text": "Local Courts\n\nLesotho’s independent judicial system is an effective means for enforcing property and contractual rights, and Lesotho has a written and consistently applied commercial law. The judicial system is, however, inefficient – courts are overburdened and cases can take years to resolve.\n\nThe legal system is a mixture of Roman-Dutch and English Common Law. There is no trial by jury.\n\nStructure of the court system\n\nThe Supreme Court of Lesotho is the Highest Court in Lesotho. No other court may alter a decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal. Its decisions are binding on all courts of lower hierarchy.\n\nThe High Court of Lesotho is located in the capital, namely, Maseru. It has unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil and criminal proceedings and the power to review the decisions or proceedings of any subordinate or inferior courts, court martials, tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or public administration functions. Matters of a commercial nature are heard and determined by the Commercial Court, a division of the High Court. The Land Court, also a division of the High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine land disputes. It has no criminal jurisdiction in any matter.\n\nThe Subordinate Courts or Magistrates Courts are lower courts and deal with less serious civil and criminal matters.\n\nThe Labour Court deals with matters relating to labour disputes, whilst the Labour Appeal Court hears and determines appeals from the Labour Court.\n\nFurther there are courts that function when the need arises i.e. court martials. Tribunals are also established for certain matters. Chief administer customary and tribunal disputes.\n\nPerception of the local courts\n\nLesotho’s independent judicial system is an effective means for enforcing property and contractual rights, and Lesotho has a written and consistently applied commercial law. The judicial system is, however, inefficient – courts are overburdened with work and are inefficient and maladministered. Matters may take over a year to be finalised and in some cases even longer than a year.\n\nEffectiveness of the court system\n\nThe Courts in Lesotho are governed by relevant Rules for the different courts. Judgments delivered by the Court of Appeal of Lesotho are of high quality.\n\nThe courts are however maladministered and are inefficient. Litigation in Lesotho may take anything from one year and longer to be finalised due to the latter problems. Judgments in the High Court may take some time to be delivered and matters that appear on the roll may not always proceed as scheduled.\n\nJudiciary\n\nThe President of the Court of Appeal of Lesotho is appointed by the King on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Justices of Appeal are also appointed by the King acting in accordance with the advice of the Judicial Services Commission after consultation with the President.\n\nThe Chief Justice of the High Court is appointed by the King in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister. The puisne Judges are appointed by the King in accordance with the advice of the Judicial Services Commission.\n\nThe King may in consultation with the Judicial Services Commission appointed persons to be Magistrates or acting Magistrates in the Subordinate Courts.\n\nJudges are required to be fit and proper persons and the criteria for to be disqualified to be appointed as a Judge is found in the Constitution of Lesotho.\n\nArbitration\n\nArbitrations are governed by the Arbitration Act, 1980 (The “Act”) and arbitration agreements concluded between the parties. The Act is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and is outdated.\n\nArbitration agreements are binding on the parties and can only be terminated by consent of all the parties thereto. The court may on application and on good cause shown set aside an arbitration agreement; order that a particular dispute, referred to in the arbitration agreement, be referred to arbitration, or order that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect.\n\nLesotho does not have an arbitration forum and often in practice the rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa are contractually agreed upon.\n\nEnforcement of foreign judgements\n\nA foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in Lesotho. The procedure to follow is for the foreign judgment to be placed before the court in Lesotho for it to be recognised and thereafter to enforce it in Lesotho as a judgment of the Lesotho High Court.\n\nForeign judgments can be enforced by making use of the common law or in terms of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Proclamation of 1922.\n\nIn terms of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Proclamation, judgments obtained in the High Courts in England, Ireland or Scotland can be enforced by use of the Proclamation. The proclamation has also been extended to include Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, New Zealand, Australia and Uganda.\n\nTo have a judgment recognised in terms of the common law or the Proclamation, one has to prove the necessary requirements.\n\nCorporation Tax\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 1993 (the “Income Tax Act”) provides for Corporation Tax. Corporation Tax is paid ahead of the financial year end. It is usually paid in quarterly instalments. This helps ease the burden of paying taxes due as a lump sum at the end of the financial year. A refund will be made by the Revenue Services Lesotho where a taxpayer has been over assessed.\n\nA resident company which pays a dividend is liable to make advance payments of income tax. Dividends are treated as paid first out of qualified income (manufacturing income) and then out of other income. A dividend paid by a resident company shall not be included in the gross income of a resident shareholder.\n\nA branch in Lesotho of a non-resident company is treated as a separate resident company, for tax purposes.. A non-resident company is subject to tax at the standard rate of tax on repatriated income in addition to income tax on chargeable income – subject any double taxation agreements.\n\nCorporation tax is applied at a rate of 25%, with a special rate of 10% on manufacturing income. Manufacturing income derived from manufacturing activities relating exclusively to exports to any country other than a country within the Southern African Customs Union is taxed at 0%.\n\nTransfer Pricing\n\nTransfer pricing is used to shift tax liabilities among associate taxpayers to obtain the best overall tax overcome. In terms of the Income Tax Act, the Commissioner has broad powers to distribute or allocate income, deductions or credits between associated taxpayers to prevent the evasion of Lesotho tax or to clearly reflect the income of such taxpayer.\n\nThe above includes the adjusting of income arising from the transfer of intangible property between associates so that it is commensurate with the income attributable to the tangible.\n\nTransfer pricing often involves recharacterisation of income or the manipulation of source rules. The source and nature of any income or loss can be recharacterised.\n\nExchange Control\n\nThe Exchange Control Order, 1987 (the “Order”), as amended together with the Exchange Control Regulations, 1989, governs the dealing in gold, currency and securities in Lesotho.\n\nThe Central Bank of Lesotho is responsible for the day to day administration of exchange control.\n\nOnly authorised dealers shall buy, borrow, sell or lend foreign currency or gold. The Minister of Finance may impose conditions upon which an authorised dealer shall buy, borrow, receive, sell, lend or deliver foreign currency.\n\nThe commercial banks in Lesotho are appointed as authorised dealers in foreign exchange subject to certain limitations.\n\nThere are restrictions in place with regard to the import and export of currency, gold, securities, local banknotes, etc. There are also restrictions in place where non-residents deal in securities, they require the Minister of Finance’s permission to deal with their securities. The Minister’s permission may be subject to conditions.\n\nThe Order also makes provision for offences when the Order is contravened.\n\nExport Processing Zone\n\nLesotho is a lesser developed country in which about three-fourths of the people live in rural areas and engage in substance agriculture. Lesotho’s largest public employer is the textile and garment industry.\n\nBilateral trade between the United States (the “US”) and Lesotho is characterised by the latter country’s rapid expansion of its exports to the US.\n\nThe US has traditionally provided a ready market for Lesotho’s exports of apparel which has been strongly boosted by the advent of African Growth and Opportunity Act (“AGOA”). Due to the highly concentrated nature of Lesotho’s exports in textile and apparel, the country has the distinction of having its exports falling under AGOA.\n\nAGOA is aimed at boasting African trade by offering duty-free access to lucrative US markets.\n\nCapital Gains Tax\n\nIn terms of the Income Tax Act, the general principle is that a gain on the disposal of a business or investment asset is taken into account in determining chargeable income. There is no separate capital gains taxation for companies. Individuals and companies are taxed on the same basis.\n\nThe excess amount of consideration received over the adjusted cost-base of an asset is known as capital gain. This gain is subjected to taxation as ordinary income at the standard corporate tax rate.\n\nIf assets are transferred between spouses or former spouses as part of a divorce settlement, or if an asset is sold or involuntarily converted and the proceeds are used to reinvest in a similar asset, then no capital gain or loss will be realised.Capital gains are taxed at 25%.\n\nDividends\n\nA nonresident who receives a dividend payment from a resident company in Lesotho is required to pay withholding tax. The rate of withholding tax is usually 25%, as stated in the Income Tax Act, but may be reduced if there is a double taxation agreement in place.\n\nThis tax is considered final, unless the taxpayer chooses to file a return to claim deductions. However, if the taxpayer believes that the withholding tax paid during the tax year is higher than the amount that would be payable if they filed a return along with supporting documents, they may choose to file for deductions (as stated in the LRA Withholding Tax Guide).\n\nDividends paid from manufacturing income, which is taxed at a concessional rate under section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act, are not subject to withholding tax as per the laws of Lesotho.\n\nInterest\n\nIf a nonresident receives interest payments from a resident company in Lesotho withholding tax applies. The rate of withholding tax is usually 25%, but may be reduced if a double taxation agreement exists. This tax is considered final, unless the taxpayer decides to file a return claiming deductions. However, if the withholding tax paid during the tax year is higher than the amount that would be payable if the taxpayer files a return with supporting documents, they may choose to file for deductions.\n\nFor loan funds used exclusively in the production of manufacturing income, which is taxed at a concessional rate under section 10(2) of the ITA, a lower withholding tax rate of 15% applies, unless, again, a double taxation agreement provides a lower rate.\n\nRoyalties\n\nIf a nonresident receives royalty payments from a resident company in Lesotho, withholding tax applies. The rate of withholding tax is typically 25%, unless a double taxation agreement provides a lower rate. This tax is considered final unless the taxpayer chooses to file a return claiming deductions.\n\nIn cases where technology is used solely in the production of manufacturing income, which is taxed at a concessional rate under section 10(2) of the ITA, royalty payments are subject to a lower withholding tax rate of 15%.\n\nTechnical Service Fees\n\nA withholding tax of 10% is charged on the gross amount of a payment made under a Lesotho-based service contract to a nonresident, unless a double taxation agreement provides a lower rate. This tax is considered final, unless the taxpayer decides to file a return claiming deductions. However, this withholding tax does not apply to a management charge that is subject to withholding tax under section 107 of the ITA.\n\nPayroll Tax and Social Security\n\nIn Lesotho, the employer withholds individual income tax from the employee's earnings and remits the tax to the tax authority.\n\nWithholding tax by employers is required on all payments of employment income to n employee.\n\nIf an employee is a resident individual the following rates are applied for the 2022/2023 tax year:\n\nIncome up to M67 440 is taxable at 20%; and\n\nAny income above M67 440 is taxable at 30%.\n\nA non-refundable tax credit amount of M10 560 is to be deducted from the sum of (1) and (2).\n\nValue Added tax\n\nValue Added Tax (“VAT”) is imposed on every taxable supply or every taxable import. The VAT Act, 2003 (the “VAT Act”), makes provision for transactions which are excepted from VAT.\n\nIn the case of a taxable supply the vendor will be liable to account for the VAT and in the case of a taxable import, the importer will be liable to account therefor.\n\nRegistration is compulsory for any business which supplies taxable goods or services and whose annual taxable turnover exceeds the registration threshold, currently being M 850 000 per annum.\n\nWhen a business turnover is below the registration threshold, such a business may nonetheless apply for voluntary registration if it can show good cause.\n\nAs soon as a business’ taxable turnover exceeds the registration threshold the business is obliged to register VAT. Should the vendor fail to register for VAT, the vendor becomes liable to pay VAT on all taxable supplies made from the time the vendor became eligible, regardless of whether or not the VAT was charged and collected. An additional tax for failure to register will be imposed.\n\nVAT is payable on most goods sold and services rendered at the rate of 15%. Basic foodstuffs and exports are zero-rated, and there is a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the supply of electricity.\n\nLosses\n\nThe loss resulting from the sale of an asset is calculated as the difference between the adjusted cost base and the amount received for the sale. Losses that occur during the sale of investment assets can be offset against capital gains that arise from the sale of other investment assets during the same year. However, they cannot be offset against gains from business assets or other chargeable income. If a loss is disallowed due to this rule, it can be carried forward to the next tax year and used to offset gains from the sale of investment assets.\n\nThere are certain situations where the transfer of assets between spouses or former spouses, as part of a divorce settlement, or the involuntary conversion or sale of an asset, where the proceeds are reinvested in a like-kind asset, do not result in capital gain or loss.\n\nStamp Duty\n\nStamp Duties are regulated by the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Act, 1989 as amended from time to time.\n\nStamp Duties are applicable on the following:\n\nAffidavits or solemn or attested declarations;\n\nAgreements or contracts;\n\nAntenuptial or postnuptial contracts;\n\nArbitration or awards;\n\nAuthentication certificate;\n\nBills of exchange or promissory notes;\n\nBill of lading;\n\nBrokers notes;\n\nCertificate by a person other than a notary in a public or official capacity;\n\nCharter party;\n\nCustom & Excise Documents;\n\nDuplicate original of an instrument;\n\nLease or agreement of lease;\n\nLeases granted under the Land Act;\n\nNotarial Act or Instrument;\n\nPartnership Agreements;\n\nPolicy of Insurance;\n\nPower of Attorney;\n\nReceipts;\n\nSecurity or suretyship;\n\nTransfer Deeds; and\n\nWarehouse Receipts.\n\nReal Property Tax\n\nStamp Duty is imposed on transfer deeds relating to immovable property in terms of the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Act, 1989.\n\nWhere the value of the property does not exceed M7 000,00, then for every M100,00 or part thereof M1,00 is charged. Where the value of consideration of the property exceeds M7 000,00, then the first M7 000,00 is charged at a rate of M1,00 for every M100,00 or part thereof and the excess is charged at M3,00 for every M100,00.\n\nTransfer Duty is payable in terms of the Transfer Duty Act, 1966. Transfer Duty is calculated as follows.\n\nWhere the consideration of the property does not exceed M10 000,00 then the rate is 3% of the consideration of the property.\n\nWhere the consideration of the property exceeds M10 000,00 then the rate is 3% for the first M10 000,00 and the excess is taxed at 4%.\n\nVAT is also payable except if a transaction is exempted from paying VAT."
