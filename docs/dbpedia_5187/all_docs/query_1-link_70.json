        "text": "Until 2011, the registration of births and deaths was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship Affairs, previously known as the Ministry of Interior. Birth and death registration booklets were distributed to the local chiefs. When an event was reported, a notification form was completed. The informant had to submit the form to the district administrator’s office for the registration of births and deaths and the issuance of certificates.\n\nThe notification form was in triplicate: one form remained with the chiefs, one copy was submitted to the district administrator’s office, and the last copy was submitted to the Bureau of Statistics for the production of vital statistics. During this time, marriage records were kept in the law office, while divorce records were kept by the courts.\n\nThe NICR started registering vital events in 2011. The process was regulated by the National Identity Cards Act of 2011, which provides for the establishment of a national identity register. The whole system was overhauled, and everyone had to reregister for births before being issued with the new identity documents. The plan was for the NICR to provide every citizen of Lesotho with a national identity card, but the office, because of its resource capability, was given the mandate to register vital events in Lesotho.\n\nNICR has worked hard to improve and strengthen the CRVS system in the Kingdom of Lesotho. The system has been computerized, and birth, death, and marriage certificates are produced from a networked system that is interconnected with identity and passport registration services. Computers are used for registration as well as for storage and retrieval.\n\nThe database stores the information electronically and can therefore be easily updated to reflect the permanence and continuing nature of civil registration.\n\nThe events covered by the civil registration system are listed in Table 1.\n\nThe Registration of Births and Deaths Act is comprehensive with respect to birth registration; it makes provision for the appointment of the registrar, district registrars, and assistant district registrars. It also obliges the birth of every child in Lesotho to be registered and gives the parent of the child the primary responsibility to ensure that their child is registered. If the father and mother have died or are incapacitated, the Act provides that any person or occupier of the premises in which the birth occurred, if they have knowledge of the birth, can report it for registration, or any person present at the birth can do so.\n\nRequirements for birth registration include:\n\nIdentification of the child’s father;\n\nFather’s presence at registration;\n\nFather’s consent;\n\nIdentification of the child’s mother;\n\nMother’s presence at registration;\n\nMother’s consent;\n\nMarriage certificate or proof of marriage;\n\nBirth notification;\n\nImmunization card;\n\nName of the child; and\n\nBaptismal certificate or letter from the family or local authority.\n\nIf the father or mother are not willing to recognize the child, a relative, guardian, or social worker can register the child.\n\nThe key data elements collected at birth registration include:\n\nChild: name, date of birth, sex, weight at birth, place of occurrence of the birth, type of place of occurrence (hospital, home, etc.), date of registration, place of registration, attendant at birth, and type of birth (single or multiple);\n\nMother of the child: place of usual residence, place/country of birth, marital status, number of children born alive during her lifetime, number of fetal deaths during her lifetime, and date of marriage; and\n\nFather of the child: date of birth or age, marital status, place of usual residence, occupation, and date of marriage.\n\nA birth certificate is required to apply for national identity documents and passports, inheritance, and social assistance.\n\nFor birth registration, the information required for civil registration is used from the locality where birth events occur. There are two birth processes, depending on whether the birth occurred in the community or in a health facility.\n\nBirths in the community: the declarant will notify the village chief, who will in turn provide a confirmation letter. The chief can only provide a birth or death authentication letter upon request, which the family brings to the civil registration office for registration.\n\nBirths in health facilities: the attending health provider issues a medical certificate or a health card. This medical proof of birth is provided for a fee in some health facilities. At the office of the civil registrar, the informant (preferably the parents), with evidence of the birth (such as a medical certificate, health/clinic card, and baptismal card), is present to give information about the birth.\n\nThe registration officer interviews the informant and completes the application form (form C), which must be signed by the informant after he or she checks that the information recorded is correct. The registration officer often prints the completed copy of form C so the informant can read it before signing and then records the information in the physical birth register (form A), which is not necessarily signed by the informant.\n\nBirth registration application forms are entered and processed in the electronic database. The informant does not sign electronically to approve the information entered, but the signature of the NICR director is automatically added. The unique identity number is automatically generated and will link all other future vital events. After this, for on-time registration (within the year of birth), the registration officer immediately issues a birth certificate free of charge. If the birth certificate is not issued immediately because of a lack of supplies, parents must return at a later date to pick it up.\n\nLate registrations (before age 1) follow the same process, with a few exceptions. In addition to a proof of the birth having occurred, there should be proof that the birth has never been registered and written authority by the NICR director for registration to proceed. However, the decision depends primarily on the discretion of the district registrar.\n\nIf the paternity of the child is not clearly established, or the child does not yet have a name, registration is still permitted, but the sections for missing particulars are left blank. Entries can be inserted later upon presentation of an affidavit and with the mother’s consent. If the mother is dead, a family member can stand in for her.\n\nFor an abandoned child, the village chief alerts the police who conduct the necessary investigation and entrust the case to a social worker. According to the Children’s Protection and Welfare Act, 2011, after declaring the birth to the local civil registrar, the social worker is responsible for ensuring that the child receives the required family or alternative care. Supporting documents required for the registration of births outside Lesotho are similar to those that occur outside health facilities. However, some additional documents are required, including the abridged birth certificate from the country of birth or the immunization booklet if the abridged certificate is not available.\n\nIn the event of a death, an official death certificate is issued to the family of the deceased after registration. The following legal information must be presented to register a death:\n\nMedical death certificate, including date of death and age at death;\n\nIdentification card of the deceased; and\n\nIdentification card of the informant.\n\nThe time period allowed for registering a death is one year.\n\nThere is no fee for registration, but penalties are charged for late registration. No other official fees are involved in the death registration process. The registration requirements or fees do not depend on whether the deceased were residents in the country and of foreign nationality.\n\nThe key data elements collected at death registration include:\n\nDeceased: name, sex, date of birth or age, marital status, place of usual residence, and place of usual residence of the mother (for deaths under 1 year of age);\n\nDeath: date of death, place of occurrence of the death, type of place of occurrence (hospital, home, etc.), date of registration, place of registration, and cause of death; and\n\nFetal deaths: date of occurrence of fetal delivery, date of registration, place of occurrence, place of registration, type of place of occurrence (hospital, home, etc.), sex of the fetus, date of birth or age of the mother, children born alive to the mother during her lifetime, fetal deaths to the mother during her lifetime, and date of previous live birth to the mother.\n\nA death certificate is required for claiming inheritance, claiming insurance benefits, and obtaining social assistance for orphaned children.\n\nWhen a death occurs inside or outside health facilities, the village chief is informed. In most cases, in collaboration with councils, the chief gives verbal authorization and a site to bury the body. In the communities, village health workers record all deaths that occur in their respective villages in a Family Health Services Village Register.\n\nUpon request, the village chief (in rural areas) or the council office (in urban areas) can also provide a burial authorization letter written by hand.\n\nThe informant who has evidence of a death is to report it to the NICR office in the district. He or she is interviewed by the registration officer and completes the death registration application form (form D).\n\nThere are generally two main documents:\n\nPost-mortem report: a police report when the death did not occur at the hospital or at a recognized institution. Health facilities also issue a confirmation of death occurring on their premises. Negotiable fees are charged to issue the medical certification of causes of death and to carry out a post-mortem.\n\nMedical certificate of cause of death (form Q): a document issued by a medical officer who was last in attendance when the death occurred.\n\nEach of these documents provides the deceased’s name, date of death, cause of death, and date of issue of the document. The registration officer registers the event using whichever document applies, then makes an official record of the information in the physical Register of Death (form B). The informant does not necessarily have to sign the register.\n\nUpon registration, the registrar issues a burial permit and a death certificate to facilitate the burial of the deceased. For deaths that occurred outside the country, a death certificate from the country where the body is being brought from and the issuance of a permit to allow the body to be buried are required for a dead body to be imported.\n\nIn Lesotho, the solemnization of marriages is governed by the Marriage Act No. 10 (1974). The legal age for marriage is 21 years for men and women. Exemptions are provided in the following cases: 16 years for women and 18 years for men, with parents’ or guardians’ consent. There is no legal obligation to register marriages. A non-impediment letter is the only other registration requirement, if one spouse was born outside the country or has dual citizenship.\n\nThe notice of marriage is usually given to the marriage officer (district registrar or minister of religion) by the parties themselves or by the parents of the parties who intend to contract the marriage. The marriage officer publishes the banns, to be read aloud on three successive Sundays before the marriage is solemnized or posts the banns in a conspicuous place for an unbroken period covering three Sundays (Marriage Act No. 10 of 1974 s. 17 (1), (a), (b)).\n\nAlternatively, the contracting parties may themselves give notice of marriage, if both have attained the age of maturity (21 years). The civil marriage is monogamous; if someone has any grievances or any reasons why the couple should not be married, the complainant is required to lodge a caveat. This issue must be resolved before the marriage can proceed. Where there is no caveat, the marriage licence is issued. The marriage must be celebrated within 90 days, or the licence becomes invalid. The licence is submitted to an approved church to celebrate the marriage or to the civil registrar, who will celebrate the marriage and issue a marriage certificate.\n\nThe requirements for marriage registration include:\n\nHusband’s presence at registration;\n\nWife’s presence at registration;\n\nResidential proof of husband;\n\nResidential proof of wife;\n\nProof of wife’s age;\n\nProof of husband’s age;\n\nWitness to the marriage;\n\nIdentity documents of both bride and groom and their witnesses; and\n\nDivorce decree and certificate to remarry, in special cases.\n\nThe following information is collected in the marriage register:\n\nSpouses: date of birth or age of bride, place of usual residence of bride, date of birth or age of groom, place of usual residence of groom, and occupation of bride and groom; and\n\nMarriage: date of occurrence, date of registration, place of occurrence, and place of registration.\n\nA marriage certificate is also vital for registering children, transferring or sharing land ownership, and travelling.\n\nCivil marriages are registered by the district registrar who solemnized the marriage or by a minister of religion who is licensed as marriage officer, if the wedding took place in a particular church. The parties each contribute US$0.03 in revenue stamps to be affixed to the original and duplicate certificates, respectively. If the contracting parties need a special licence, US$0.73 is required; the special licence is granted when the marriage ceremony takes place in an area other than the usual premises for conducting ceremonies. However, as required by law, the bride and groom must show the marriage officer identification as proof of age. Local registrars are prohibited in all cases from taking any fees other than those specified in the law. Duplication of registration may happen only incidentally; otherwise, only single registration is allowed. The error can be detected by the Office of the Registrar General.\n\nA customary marriage, according to the custom of Basotho, is deemed complete and valid after three conditions are met and with substantial evidence:\n\nAn agreement between the parties;\n\nAn agreement between the families; and\n\nPayment of part or all of the bohali/lobola.\n\nPetitions for divorce are filed either in the High Court or in the local court, depending on the type of marriage contracted. In customary marriages, divorce cases can also be heard by higher levels of the court system because of an appeal against the decision of lower levels. However, the divorce law that correlates with marriage does not exist in statute in Lesotho. There is no specific law requiring the registration of divorces, except the National Identity Card Act of 2011, which briefly lists divorces among other civil status events to be recorded in the civil status register.\n\nEither party to a marriage may present a petition for divorce to the court. The parties are usually encouraged to pursue reconciliation, which must also involve both families of the parties. If reconciliation fails, the notification of the intentional act of divorce is sent to the High Court registrar; no legal action takes place for three weeks. Any of the partners in a marriage has a legal right to institute a divorce petition in the law court to dissolve their marriage. There are no specific guidelines and norms for the registration of divorce cases.\n\nOnly the courts can grant a civil divorce. After this is done, the divorce is considered to have been registered, as records are maintained at the various stages of the process. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. The petitioner files a lawsuit.\n\n2. The court serves the respondent with the lawsuit.\n\n3. The respondent has eight days to file his or her response or make an appearance.\n\n4. The petitioner is served with the response and is expected to file for a day for the hearing of the case (what is referred to as setting down). Most divorce cases are heard in camera (behind closed doors).\n\n5. If the petitioner finds favour with the judge, a divorce is granted. The judgement or divorce decree given is considered as a certificate.\n\nThe requirements for the termination of customary marriages are guided by the laws of Lerotholi of 1903, which provide for situations where customary divorce can be granted. The legislation states: “Termination of any marriage under subsection (1) may be effected by local courts where such request is made by any of the parties on grounds of malicious desertion or on behalf of a woman for aggravated abuse or neglect or for any other reasons recognized under customary law.” The law states that the reason for such an application may be desertion or unbearable living conditions for the woman or the husband not taking good care of his wife. The law further states that the court should go so far as to make a ruling on whether the bride price should be returned or forfeited, as well as to whom custody of the children should be awarded. Like civil divorces, customary divorces are granted after all efforts to reconcile the couple have failed.\n\nAccording to Islamic rules, divorce is the last resort when a marriage does not work.\n\nOnly the husband can divorce his wife when there are compelling reasons to do so. The wife can persuade the husband to divorce her, going so far as returning the bride price in exchange for divorce.\n\nWhen the parties have tentatively agreed to divorce, the husband approaches the mosque authorities (Maulana), stating his intention to divorce and the reasons for it.\n\nThe authorities will intervene by calling all the stakeholders, including the parents of the woman, with an intention to defuse the situation. If the intervention fails, the authorities have no option but to invite the parents of the wife and/ or witnesses (preferably those who were present at marriage) to witness the divorce process.\n\nWithin three months after the husband has first indicated an intention to divorce, he should have informed the wife three times about his intention to divorce, or the divorce cannot stand. Divorces are not registered as such, but when the divorce takes place at the mosque, the parties must complete and sign a form. The Maulana keep this form at the mosque as proof of divorce.\n\nRegistration fee\n\nRegistration and certification of vital events are free of charge, but late registration costs US$0.30 for births and US$0.17 for deaths.\n\nDirect costs of registering and certifying vital events are shown in Tables 2 and 3."
