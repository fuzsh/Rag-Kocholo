        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nParamount chief MOSHOESHOE I consolidated what would become Basutoland in the early 19th century and made himself king in 1822. Continuing encroachments by Dutch settlers from the neighboring Orange Free State caused the king to enter into an 1868 agreement with the UK by which Basutoland became a British protectorate, and after 1884, a crown colony. Upon independence in 1966, the country was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho. The Basotho National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE II was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Batswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections in 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following month. MOSISILI returned to power in snap elections in February 2015 after the collapse of THABANEâs coalition government and an alleged attempted military coup. In June 2017, THABANE returned to become prime minister.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Africa, an enclave of South Africa\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n29 30 S, 28 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 30,355 sq km\n\nland: 30,355 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 141\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,106 km\n\nborder countries (1): South Africa 1,106 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ntemperate; cool to cold, dry winters; hot, wet summers\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly highland with plateaus, hills, and mountains\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Thabana Ntlenyana 3,482 m\n\nlowest point: junction of the Orange and Makhaleng Rivers 1,400 m\n\nmean elevation: 2,161 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nwater, agricultural and grazing land, diamonds, sand, clay, building stone\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 76.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 10.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 65.9% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 1.5% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 22.4% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n12 sq km (2013)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nOrange river source (shared with South Africa and Namibia [m]) - 2,092 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Orange (941,351 sq km)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nrelatively higher population density in the western half of the nation, with the capital of Maseru, and the smaller cities of Mafeteng, Teyateyaneng, and Leribe attracting the most people as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nperiodic droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked, an enclave of (completely surrounded by) South Africa; mountainous, more than 80% of the country is 1,800 m above sea level\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n2,193,970 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 147\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)\n\nadjective: Basotho\n\nEthnic groups\n\nSotho 99.7%, Europeans, Asians, and other 0.3%\n\nLanguages\n\nSesotho (official) (southern Sotho), English (official), Zulu, Xhosa\n\nReligions\n\nProtestant 47.8% (Pentecostal 23.1%, Lesotho Evangelical 17.3%, Anglican 7.4%), Roman Catholic 39.3%, other Christian 9.1%, non-Christian 1.4%, none 2.3% (2014 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nLesotho faces great socioeconomic challenges. More than half of its population lives below the poverty line, and the countryâs HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is the second highest in the world. In addition, Lesotho is a small, mountainous, landlocked country with little arable land, leaving its population vulnerable to food shortages and reliant on remittances. Lesothoâs persistently high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates have been increasing during the last decade, according to the last two Demographic and Health Surveys. Despite these significant shortcomings, Lesotho has made good progress in education; it is on-track to achieve universal primary education and has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa.\n\nLesothoâs migration history is linked to its unique geography; it is surrounded by South Africa with which it shares linguistic and cultural traits. Lesotho at one time had more of its workforce employed outside its borders than any other country. Today remittances equal about 17% of its GDP. With few job options at home, a high rate of poverty, and higher wages available across the border, labor migration to South Africa replaced agriculture as the prevailing Basotho source of income decades ago. The majority of Basotho migrants were single men contracted to work as gold miners in South Africa. However, migration trends changed in the 1990s, and fewer men found mining jobs in South Africa because of declining gold prices, stricter immigration policies, and a preference for South African workers.\n\nAlthough men still dominate cross-border labor migration, more women are working in South Africa, mostly as domestics, because they are widows or their husbands are unemployed. Internal rural-urban flows have also become more frequent, with more women migrating within the country to take up jobs in the garment industry or moving to care for loved ones with HIV/AIDS. Lesothoâs small population of immigrants is increasingly composed of Taiwanese and Chinese migrants who are involved in the textile industry and small retail businesses.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 31.3% (male 309,991/female 306,321)\n\n15-24 years: 19.26% (male 181,874/female 197,452)\n\n25-54 years: 38.86% (male 373,323/female 391,901)\n\n55-64 years: 4.98% (male 52,441/female 45,726)\n\n65 years and over: 5.6% (male 57,030/female 53,275) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 62.1\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 55.3\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 6.8\n\npotential support ratio: 14.7 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 24.7 years\n\nmale: 24.7 years\n\nfemale: 24.7 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.76% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 121\n\nBirth rate\n\n23.15 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 50\n\nDeath rate\n\n11.05 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 22\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-4.55 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 199\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nrelatively higher population density in the western half of the nation, with the capital of Maseru, and the smaller cities of Mafeteng, Teyateyaneng, and Leribe attracting the most people as shown in this population distribution map\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 30.4% of total population (2023)\n\nrate of urbanization: 2.77% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n202,000 MASERU (capital) (2018)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 0.74 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.48 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n\nMother's mean age at first birth\n\n20.9 years (2014 est.)\n\nnote: data represents median age at first birth among women 25-49\n\nMaternal mortality ratio\n\n544 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 17\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 48.44 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 54 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 42.72 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 23\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 59.57 years\n\nmale: 57.57 years\n\nfemale: 61.64 years (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 220\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.92 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 51\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n64.9% (2018)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 95.7% of population\n\nrural: 77.2% of population\n\ntotal: 82.6% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 4.3% of population\n\nrural: 22.8% of population\n\ntotal: 17.4% of population (2020 est.)\n\nCurrent health expenditure\n\n11.3% of GDP (2019)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.47 physicians/1,000 population (2018)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 93.6% of population\n\nrural: 62.4% of population\n\ntotal: 71.4% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 6.4% of population\n\nrural: 37.6% of population\n\ntotal: 28.6% of population (2020 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n20.9% (2021 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 2\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\ndegree of risk: intermediate (2020)\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n16.6% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 122\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 3.56 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 1.98 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.44 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.31 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 0.82 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 103\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 24.3% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 43.1% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 5.4% (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n10.5% (2018)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 57\n\nChild marriage\n\nwomen married by age 15: 1%\n\nwomen married by age 18: 16.4%\n\nmen married by age 18: 1.9% (2018 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n8.7% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 11\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 79.4%\n\nmale: 70.1%\n\nfemale: 88.3% (2015)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 12 years\n\nmale: 12 years\n\nfemale: 13 years (2017)\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 25.6%\n\nmale: 18.6% NA\n\nfemale: 38.1% (2019 est.)

the forecasted proportion translates into 320,000 people in rural areas, while an additional 201,000 people in urban areas are foreseen to also need assistance; the foreseen increase of acute food insecurity levels is primarily due to the reduced harvest, high food prices in basic food and nonâfood commodities and a slow recovery of householdsâ income reflecting a downturn in economic growth; harvesting of the 2022 main-season summer cereal crops, mostly maize and sorghum, is complete; production of maize, the main cereal staple, is about oneâthird of the average, while the sorghum output is almost negligible; the poor harvest was primarily due to torrential rainfalls during January and February 2022, which caused localized flooding and resulted in crop losses (2022)\n\nWaste and recycling\n\nmunicipal solid waste generated annually: 73,457 tons (2006 est.)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nOrange river source (shared with South Africa and Namibia [m]) - 2,092 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source;

About three-fourths of the people live in rural areas and engage in animal herding and subsistence agriculture, although Lesotho produces less than 20% of the nation's demand for food. Agriculture is vulnerable to weather and climate variability.\n\nÂ\n\nLesotho relies on South Africa for much of its economic activity; Lesotho imports 85% of the goods it consumes from South Africa, including most agricultural inputs. Households depend heavily on remittances from family members working in South Africa in mines, on farms, and as domestic workers, though mining employment has declined substantially since the 1990s. Lesotho is a member of the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and revenues from SACU accounted for roughly 26% of total GDP in 2016; however, SACU revenues are volatile and expected to decline over the next 5 years. Lesotho also gains royalties from the South African Government for water transferred to South Africa from a dam and reservoir system in Lesotho. However, the government continues to strengthen its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties and other transfers.\n\nÂ\n\nThe government maintains a large presence in the economy - government consumption accounted for about 26% of GDP in 2017. The government remains Lesotho's largest employer; in 2016, the government wage bill rose to 23% of GDP â the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho's largest private employer is the textile and garment industry - approximately 36,000 Basotho, mainly women, work in factories producing garments for export to South Africa and the US. Diamond mining in Lesotho has grown in recent years and accounted for nearly 35% of total exports in 2015. Lesotho managed steady GDP growth at an average of 4.5% from 2010 to 2014, dropping to about 2.5% in 2015-16, but poverty remains widespread around 57% of the total population.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$4.88 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$5.49 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$5.51 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 177\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n-1.6% (2017 est.)\n\n3.1% (2016 est.)\n\n2.5% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 203\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$2,300 (2020 est.)\n\n$2,600 (2019 est.)\n\n$2,600 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 207\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$2.462 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n5.3% (2019 est.)\n\n3.8% (2018 est.)\n\n5.1% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 184\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: B (2019)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 5.8% (2016 est.)\n\nindustry: 39.2% (2016 est.)\n\nservices: 54.9% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 69.2% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 26.4% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 31.4% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: -13.4% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 40.8% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -54.4% (2017 est.)\n\nAgricultural products\n\nmilk, potatoes, maize, vegetables, fruit, beef, game meat, mutton, beans, wool\n\nIndustries\n\nfood, beverages, textiles, apparel assembly, handicrafts, construction, tourism\n\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n12.5% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 6\n\nLabor force\n\n930,800 (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 141\n\nLabor force - by occupation\n\nagriculture: 86%\n\nindustry and services: 14% (2002 est.)\n\nnote: most of the resident population is engaged in subsistence agriculture; roughly 35% of the active male wage earners work in South Africa\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n28.1% (2014 est.)\n\n25% (2008 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 204\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 25.6%\n\nmale: 18.6% NA\n\nfemale: 38.1% (2019 est.)

1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)\n\nnote: the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services\n\nInternet country code\n\n.ls\n\nInternet users\n\ntotal: 921,168 (2020 est.)\n\npercent of population: 43% (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 148\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and security forces\n\nLesotho Defense Force (LDF): Army (includes Air Wing) (2022)\n\nnote: the Lesotho Mounted Police Service is responsible for internal security and reports to the Minister of Police and Public Safety\n\nMilitary expenditures\n\n1.5% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\n1.6% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\n1.8% of GDP (2019 est.)
