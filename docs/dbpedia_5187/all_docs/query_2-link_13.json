        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe small southern African kingdom of Lesotho is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, though separated from it by formidable mountains. For many years after gaining their independence in 1966, the people of this former British protectorate suffered from political turbulence, economic crises, and a growing incidence of HIV/AIDS. In the 1990s, however, the country began a series of development projects that helped improve the infrastructure and economy. A rise in tourism and an influx of foreign currency also helped improve conditions in Lesotho. The capital of Lesotho is Maseru. Area 11,720 square miles (30,355 square kilometers). Population (2024 est.) 2,120,000.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nThe Maloti and Drakensberg mountain ranges, which rise over 11,000 feet (3,350 meters), cover about two thirds of the country’s total area. Communications and transportation are difficult for the people who live in the mountains, and therefore most of the people live in the lowlands along Lesotho’s western side. A plateau formed by the mountain ranges in the east is the source of two of South Africa’s largest rivers—the Tugela and the Orange. Other important rivers in Lesotho include the Senqunyane, which flows through central Lesotho; the Komotspruit, located in the southwest; and the Matsoku, which flows through the northeast.\n\nThe lowland climate is temperate, with cool winters and warm summers. Temperatures range from a low of about 20° F (−7° C) in the winter to a high of 90° F (32° C) in the summer. The mountains have a wider range of temperatures, with relatively hotter summers and colder winters. Most precipitation falls between October and April, with an annual average of roughly 28 inches (71 centimeters).\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nMost of Lesotho’s people belong to the Sotho ethnic group. About one sixth of the population is Zulu, and there are small minorities of Asians, Europeans, and people of mixed ancestry. Sotho, a Bantu language, and English are the official languages. Christianity is the official religion, though a small fraction of the population follows traditional beliefs.\n\nMore than four fifths of the population is rural. Mountain and rural people live in family compounds made up of one family extending over several generations. The villages are clusters of huts made of earth and stone with thatched or corrugated iron roofs. In contrast, urban centers offer a blend of traditional and Western culture. Maseru is home to markets offering traditional goods as well as modern hotels and nightclubs. Many buildings were destroyed, however, during widespread rioting following the 1998 elections.\n\nEducation is important to the Sotho, who have one of the highest literacy rates in Africa. Almost three quarters of the adult population can read and write. All primary education is free, and most schools are run by Christian churches. The National University of Lesotho in Maseru offers opportunities for higher education.\n\nEconomy\n\nAgriculture, industry, and construction form the basis of Lesotho’s economy. In order to make a better living, much of the labor force crosses the border to work in South Africa. Remittances from these workers contributed roughly two thirds of the gross national product in the early 1990s, but decreased employment opportunities in South Africa led to a marked decline in the sector by decade’s end.\n\nRoughly two thirds of the labor force works in agriculture, even though only one tenth of the land is suitable for crop-growing because of the mountainous terrain. Corn (maize), fruit, sorghum, and roots and tubers are raised. About two thirds of the land is used as meadows and pastures for herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. The intensity of this farming contributes to overgrazing and soil erosion problems. Agricultural goods exported include mohair, wool, and hides, but Lesotho must import most of the products that are used in the country.\n\nManufacturing is a relatively new sector that was not substantially developed until the mid-1990s. Small factories produce candles, handicrafts, mohair yarn, and furniture. Natural resources are limited, and diamonds are the only mineral produced. Because of the lack of resources Lesotho is one of the world’s poorest countries. It relies on foreign aid and is heavily dependent on South Africa for food and most consumer goods. Lesotho is further burdened by a growing incidence of HIV/AIDS. Almost one third of the total population was living with HIV by the end of 2001.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe 1993 constitution established Lesotho as a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. A hereditary monarch serves as chief of state. However, this position is primarily a symbolic one. The government is headed by a prime minister, who is the leader of the majority party in parliament, and a cabinet. The parliament is a bicameral, or two-chambered, legislature composed of a 120-member National Assembly and a 33-member Senate. Representatives to the assembly are elected to serve five-year terms; senators are appointed by the majority party in the assembly. The High Court serves as the country’s highest court. There is also a Court of Appeal, as well as numerous lower courts.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Basotho nation was formed in the early 1800s under King Moshoeshoe I when several African groups, who were displaced by the Zulu nation, sought refuge in the Maloti mountains. Later, due to conflicts with Boers, or Dutch-speaking white settlers, Moshoeshoe asked for and received the protection of the British Crown in 1868. The land ultimately came under direct British control.\n\nIn 1960 the Basutoland Council was formed. In 1965 Chief Leabua Jonathan was chosen prime minister. The following year, the country gained independence, with King Moshoeshoe II as head of state. Jonathan was overthrown in 1986 by army commander Gen. Justin Lekhanya. The National Assembly was dissolved and the constitution was suspended. Executive and legislative powers were returned to King Moshoeshoe II, a Military Council headed by Lekhanya, and a Council of Ministers. In 1990 the king was dethroned, and his son was sworn in as King Letsie III. Lekhanya himself was ousted by rebel army officers in a bloodless coup in 1991.\n\nMilitary rule ended in 1993, and Ntsu Mokhehle of the Basotholand Congress party became prime minister. King Moshoeshoe II was restored to the throne in 1995 but died later that year in an accident and was replaced by Letsie III. In 1998 Bathuel Pakalitha Mosisili, leader of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy party, became prime minister following his party’s victory in parliamentary elections. Opposition parties questioned the results of the election, however, and widespread rioting soon occurred. Troops from South Africa and Botswana eventually helped restore order. As a result of the unrest, an Interim Political Authority was established to review the voting procedures. Under a new system developed by the authority, Mosisili was elected in 2002 to a second five-year term.\n\nDavid S. Wiley"
