        "text": "What's in this article\n\nLesotho \"The mountain Kingdom\n\nLesotho, officially the Kingdom of Lesotho\n\nA relatively small, landlocked mountainous country located entirely within the borders of South Africa. Lesotho has a population of around 2 million people and is just over 11583 square miles. The entire country lies above 3,281 ft which leads to its moniker as the Mountain kingdom. The capital, Maseru is located directly on the Lesotho-South Africa border. Interestingly Lesotho is by far the biggest one of only three other countries in the world that are surrounded by the territory of another country. The Vatican and San Marino being the other two. It is also the only territory located outside of Italy and unlike the Vatican and San Marino is not a microstate.\n\nLesotho's population consists almost entirely of the Basotho, a Bantu-speaking people. Approximately 99 percent of the people in Lesotho identify as Basotho. Sesotho is The primary language spoken regularly by the Basotho and it is also the first official language and is used government and most official institutions.\n\nThe Basotho Blanket Traditional History\n\nAccording to UNESCO, they estimate, 85% of women and 68% of men over the age of 15 are literate making Lesotho one of the highest rates of literacy in Africa. However, even with this relatively high rate of literacy, many Lesotho people battle to get access to the basic needs of healthcare, travel, and educational resources\n\nThe Basotho Blanket in Basotho culture\n\nTraditional attire revolves around the Basotho blanket, a thick covering made primarily of wool and a grass-made hat called a\"Mokorotlo\" a conical style hat with a unique shape and design on the top. It looks like the Qiloane mountain in a pinnacle shape The blankets are ubiquitous throughout the country during all seasons and worn differently by men and women.\n\nThe Basotho Blanket Origins\n\nAccording to transcripts, the Basotho Blanket was originally gifted to King Moshoeshoe I\n\nWho ruled Lesotho from 1822â€“1870 by a British man known only as \"Mr. Howell\" in the mid to late 19th century, these blankets quickly gained enormous popularity in the Lesotho region and were used by herdsmen and royalty alike\n\nBasotho blankets have very specific uses for different occasions from formal to everyday wear. The way that Basotho men wear these traditional blankets is based on the traditional Kaross, a traditional animal (primarily sheep) skin cloak although their transformation to \"factory-woven textile\" is attributed to King Moshoeshoe I.\n\nThe animal skin Karosses were becoming increasingly difficult to source and there was frequently insufficient quantity to supply the Basotho nation. By around 1872 a large majority of the traditional Kaross were replaced by poor quality cotton made blankets. In 1876 the Then king secured the production\n\nThe Basotho Blanket securing the heritage\n\nThe King secured the production of \"special blankets\" in 1876\n\nAfter meeting with Scottish textile manufacturer Donald Fraser. These new blankets were not only sturdier but they could also be fashioned in a way that more resembled the Kaross and they therefore quickly replaced the poor quality imported cloth that the people of Lesotho were previously wearing.\n\nThe Basotho Blanket in popular Culture\n\nLouis Vuitton's designs for the 2017 menswear collection featured designs from Basotho Blankets which caused controversy in South Africa with accusations of cultural appropriation.[1]\n\nIn the 2018 films Black Panther and in Avengers: Infinity Wars, W'Kabi and his tribesmen appear in many scenes wearing the Basotho blanket. Given that the actors in the film were not from Continental Africa, several continental African groups viewed the appropriation of these cultural symbols as inappropriate for use by diasporic Africans. The movie however brought the blankets to international attention and an increase in sales.\n\nThe Basotho Blanket Today\n\nThe traditional Basotho blanket still plays a very important role in the daily life of the Basotho people and despite urbanization\n\nThe Basotho remain loyal to their traditions and treasure it.\n\nThe wearing of blankets by the Basotho as part of daily life intrigues visitors to Lesotho and the surrounding Eastern Free State. It seems to be a form of westernization however, with a closer look, the wearing of Basotho blanket reveals a sociocultural phenomenon with a unique history. To the Basothos, besides the practical value of the blankets, there are social and symbolic values inherent in the blanket, national identification has become one of the most important, announcing: \"I am a Basotho\".\n\nRefernces\n\n[1]\n\nOther Basotho Blanket related blogs to enjoy\n\nTips on When, Where and How To Wear a Basotho Blanket\n\nThe Ultimate wool blanket throw : The Basotho Heritage Blanket\n\nFAQ - The Questions You Want Answered\n\nWhy is Lesotho famous?\n\nIts unique geography: Lesotho is the only country in the world that lies above 1,000 meters in elevation. It is also home to the highest peak in southern Africa, Thabana Ntlenyana, which stands at 3,482 meters.\n\nIts culture: Lesotho has a rich and unique cultural heritage, with traditional music, dance, and dress still practiced today. The Basotho people, the country's largest ethnic group, have a strong sense of community and identity.\n\nIts wildlife: Lesotho is home to various wildlife, including the rare and endangered Maloti minnow found only in the rivers of Lesotho's Maloti Mountains.\n\nIts tourism: Despite being one of the smallest countries in Africa, Lesotho has a lot to offer visitors. The country's stunning mountain scenery, cultural festivals, and adventure activities like hiking, horseback riding, and skiing attract many tourists yearly.\n\nIts political history: Lesotho has a tumultuous political history, with coups and political crises. Despite these challenges, the country has managed to maintain its independence and sovereignty and has made significant strides in improving its democracy and human rights record in recent years.\n\nIs Lesotho richer than South Africa?\n\nNo, Lesotho is not more prosperous than South Africa. South Africa is one of the most developed and industrialized countries on the African continent, with a much larger economy and higher per capita income than Lesotho.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, South Africa had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of USD 354.1 billion in 2020, while Lesotho's GDP was only USD 2.5 billion. South Africa's per capita income was also much higher than Lesotho's in 2020, with an estimated USD 5,797 per person compared to Lesotho's USD 1,129 per person.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Lesotho is a small, mountainous country with a population of around 2 million. South Africa has a much larger population of around 60 million people. Additionally, Lesotho faces significant challenges related to poverty, unemployment, and HIV/AIDS and has a much lower Human Development Index (HDI) ranking than South Africa.\n\nHow rich is Lesotho?\n\nLesotho is classified as a lower-middle-income country by the World Bank, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of around USD 2.5 billion in 2020. The country's economy is largely based on agriculture, manufacturing, and mining, focusing on diamonds, water, and textiles.\n\nDespite being a lower-middle-income country, Lesotho still faces significant challenges related to poverty, inequality, and unemployment. According to the World Bank, around 57% of the country's population lives below the poverty line, and youth unemployment is particularly high. Lesotho also has one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world, which has significantly impacted the country's economy and social development.\n\nIn recent years, the government of Lesotho has implemented several economic reforms and development initiatives to promote sustainable growth, reduce poverty, and create jobs. These efforts include investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, as well as support for small businesses and entrepreneurship. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go to address the country's economic and social challenges.\n\nIs Lesotho a first world country?\n\nNo, Lesotho is not considered a first-world country. The terms \"first world,\" \"second world,\" and \"third world\" were originally used during the Cold War to describe political and economic alliances. These terms are no longer widely used today, as they are seen as outdated and oversimplified.\n\nInstead, countries are typically classified based on their economic development and income level. Lesotho is classified as a lower-middle-income country by the World Bank, meaning it has a relatively low Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and faces significant economic and social challenges. The country has made progress in improving its human development indicators in recent years. However, it still ranks relatively low on income, education, and health measures compared to many other countries.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the terms \"first world,\" \"second world,\" and \"third world\" are often associated with outdated and inaccurate stereotypes about different regions and countries and are generally not used in contemporary discourse about global development and economics.\n\nIs it safe to live in Lesotho?\n\nLesotho is generally a safe country to live in, although there are some safety concerns that residents and visitors should be aware of.\n\nCrime is a concern in Lesotho, particularly in urban areas like the capital city, Maseru. Common types of crime include theft, burglary, and robbery, and there have also been reports of carjacking and muggings. It is essential to avoid walking alone at night and keep valuables out of sight.\n\nLesotho also faces some security challenges related to political instability and border disputes with South Africa. While these issues are generally not directly threatening residents, they can create tensions and occasional disruptions.\n\nIn addition, Lesotho has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and healthcare facilities in the country can be limited and sometimes of poor quality. This can make it difficult to access appropriate medical care, particularly for people with HIV/AIDS.\n\nDespite these challenges, many people live and work in Lesotho safely and happily. The country has a strong sense of community and culture, and the natural beauty of its mountains and other landscapes is a major attraction for residents and visitors alike.\n\nWhy is Lesotho so cold?\n\nIt is high altitude and location influence Lesotho's climate in the Southern Hemisphere. The country's elevation ranges from around 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) to over 3,400 meters (11,000 feet), significantly impacting its temperatures.\n\nAt higher elevations, the air is thinner, and temperatures are generally more relaxed. Lesotho's mountains also receive more precipitation than lower-lying areas, which can also contribute to lower temperatures.\n\nAdditionally, Lesotho is located in the Southern Hemisphere, meaning its seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere. This means the country's winter months (June to August) are generally more relaxed than its summer months (December to February).\n\nLesotho has a highland climate, with cold winters and mild summers. Average temperatures in the winter can range from below-freezing to around 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit), while summer temperatures typically range from around 15 to 25 degrees Celsius (59 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhat is the most developed country in Africa?\n\nWhen measuring development, many different factors exist, such as economic growth, infrastructure, education, healthcare, and political stability. Therefore, there are many answers to the question of which is the most developed country in Africa.\n\nSome African countries are generally considered more developed than others based on various metrics. For example, according to the Human Development Index (HDI) developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Seychelles is the most developed country in Africa, with a score of 0.801, placing it in the category of countries with \"very high human development.\" Mauritius and Algeria are also among the African countries with high HDI scores, at 0.796 and 0.754, respectively.\n\nOther factors that could be used to measure development, such as economic growth or infrastructure, could result in different countries being considered more developed. For example, countries like South Africa and Nigeria have relatively large economies and developed infrastructure, but their HDI scores are lower than countries like Seychelles and Mauritius. Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on how development is measured and which metrics are used."
