        "text": "By plane\n\n[edit]\n\nMoshoeshoe Airport is located 18 km from Maseru. South African Airways operates a couple of daily flights from Maseru to Johannesburg, which typically cost around M2,200. Luggage is lost very regularly and there is no lost luggage reporting system. You should arrange taxi pick-up in advance as there are no taxis at the airport. Taxis charge around ML100.\n\nMission Aviation flies from the smaller Moeshoeshoe I airport just off Airport Road, 2 km from central Maseru. They offer charter flights to amongst other places, Mokhotlong, Thaba-Tseka and Katse, and are contactable on +266 2232 5699. Flights are fairly expensive, their little planes can be cramped, but they fly to most airstrips in Lesotho.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bus stop on Moeshoeshoe Rd is the main taxi station, but private cabs are available from the price of M50.\n\nPublic cabs travelling around the city cost M6.50 and they are available in stations around town.\n\nFor information on catching taxis in Lesotho and Maseru, call Comfort Taxis and speak to Khosana on +266 6274 5199.\n\nFor information on catching taxis in Lesotho, Moonlight taxis are on +266 22312695.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nMany backpacker types pass through Maseru en route to Semonkong Lodge or Malealea in the mountains, or head to Ladybrand in South Africa. However do not discount Maseru as a budget overnight destination - there are affordable accommodation options, the best of which is probably the Lesotho-Durham link.\n\nThe following budget accommodations were built as training centres although they do cater for travellers if you ask in advance!"
