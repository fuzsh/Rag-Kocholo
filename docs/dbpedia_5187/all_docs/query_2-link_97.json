        "text": "Lesotho or often pronounced as \"Lee-soo-tu/Le-zoo-tu\" is a landlocked country, situated in the South African region. The country is surrounded by South Africa on all sides. Lesotho is also called an enclaved country, as it is one of the countries landlocked completely inside another single nation-state. Somewhat similar to 'San Marino' and the 'Vatican City', the kingdom of Lesotho is one of the three countries in the entire world to be known as an enclaved country. The country is known for its cold temperate weather, making it one of the best places to visit in the summer months. Maseru is the capital city of Lesotho and also the largest city. One single citizen of the country is called a 'Mosotho' and more than one is called 'Basotho'. The name Lesotho translates to 'the land of Sesotho speakers' which is one of the official languages apart from English.
