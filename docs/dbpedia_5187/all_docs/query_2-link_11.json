        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nBasutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basotho National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE II was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections in 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following month. MOSISILI returned to power in snap elections in February 2015 after the collapse of THABANE’s coalition government and an alleged attempted military coup. In June 2017, THABANE returned to become prime minister.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Africa, an enclave of South Africa\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n29 30 S, 28 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 30,355 sq km\n\nland: 30,355 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 142\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,106 km\n\nborder countries (1): South Africa 1106 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ntemperate; cool to cold, dry winters; hot, wet summers\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly highland with plateaus, hills, and mountains\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 2,161 m\n\nlowest point: junction of the Orange and Makhaleng Rivers 1,400 m\n\nhighest point: Thabana Ntlenyana 3,482 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nwater, agricultural and grazing land, diamonds, sand, clay, building stone\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 76.1% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 10.1% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 0.1% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 65.9% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 1.5% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 22.4% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n30 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nrelatively higher population density in the western half of the nation, with the capital of Maseru, and the smaller cities of Mafeteng, Teyateyaneng, and Leribe attracting the most people\n\nNatural hazards\n\nperiodic droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\npopulation pressure forcing settlement in marginal areas results in overgrazing, severe soil erosion, and soil exhaustion; desertification; Highlands Water Project controls, stores, and redirects water to South Africa\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked, an enclave of (completely surrounded by) South Africa; mountainous, more than 80% of the country is 1,800 m above sea level\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n1,962,461 (July 2018 est.)\n\nnote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 149\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)\n\nadjective: Basotho\n\nEthnic groups\n\nSotho 99.7%, Europeans, Asians, and other 0.3%\n\nLanguages\n\nSesotho (official) (southern Sotho), English (official), Zulu, Xhosa\n\nReligions\n\nProtestant 47.8% (Pentecostal 23.1%, Lesotho Evangelical 17.3%, Anglican 7.4%), Roman Catholic 39.3%, other Christian 9.1%, non-Christian 1.4%, none 2.3% (2014 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nLesotho faces great socioeconomic challenges. More than half of its population lives below the property line, and the country’s HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is the second highest in the world. In addition, Lesotho is a small, mountainous, landlocked country with little arable land, leaving its population vulnerable to food shortages and reliant on remittances. Lesotho’s persistently high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates have been increasing during the last decade, according to the last two Demographic and Health Surveys. Despite these significant shortcomings, Lesotho has made good progress in education; it is on-track to achieve universal primary education and has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa.Lesotho’s migration history is linked to its unique geography; it is surrounded by South Africa with which it shares linguistic and cultural traits. Lesotho at one time had more of its workforce employed outside its borders than any other country. Today remittances equal about 17% of its GDP. With few job options at home, a high rate of poverty, and higher wages available across the border, labor migration to South Africa replaced agriculture as the prevailing Basotho source of income decades ago. The majority of Basotho migrants were single men contracted to work as gold miners in South Africa. However, migration trends changed in the 1990s, and fewer men found mining jobs in South Africa because of declining gold prices, stricter immigration policies, and a preference for South African workers.Although men still dominate cross-border labor migration, more women are working in South Africa, mostly as domestics, because they are widows or their husbands are unemployed. Internal rural-urban flows have also become more frequent, with more women migrating within the country to take up jobs in the garment industry or moving to care for loved ones with HIV/AIDS. Lesotho’s small population of immigrants is increasingly composed of Taiwanese and Chinese migrants who are involved in the textile industry and small retail businesses.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 31.84%(male 314,155 /female 310,772)\n\n15-24 years: 19.34%(male 181,332 /female 198,236)\n\n25-54 years: 38.27%(male 366,652 /female 384,333)\n\n55-64 years: 5.02%(male 52,490 /female 46,016)\n\n65 years and over: 5.53%(male 55,804 /female 52,671) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 66.9 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 59.5 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 7.4 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 13.5 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 24.4 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 24.4 years\n\nfemale: 24.3 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.24% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 178\n\nBirth rate\n\n24.2 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 52\n\nDeath rate\n\n15.1 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 2\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-6.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 205\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nrelatively higher population density in the western half of the nation, with the capital of Maseru, and the smaller cities of Mafeteng, Teyateyaneng, and Leribe attracting the most people\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 28.6% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 2.83% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n202,000 MASERU (capital) (2018)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 0.91 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 1.14 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 1.06 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2018 est.)\n\nMother's mean age at first birth\n\n21 years (2014 est.)\n\nnote: median age at first birth among women 25-29\n\nMaternal mortality rate\n\n544 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 17\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 44.6 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 48.1 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 40.9 deaths/1,000 live births\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 36\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 53 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 53 years\n\nfemale: 53.1 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 221\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.59 children born/woman (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 72\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n60.2% (2014)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 94.6% of population\n\nrural: 77% of population\n\ntotal: 81.8% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 5.4% of population\n\nrural: 23% of population\n\ntotal: 18.2% of population (2015 est.)\n\nCurrent Health Expenditure\n\n8.1% (2016)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.07 physicians/1,000 population (2010)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 37.3% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 27.6% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 30.3% of population (2015 est.)\n\nunimproved: urban: 62.7% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 72.4% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 69.7% of population (2015 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n23.6% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 2\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS\n\n340,000 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths\n\n6,100 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 24\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n16.6% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 122\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n10.5% (2014)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 60\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n6.4% of GDP (2018)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 23\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 79.4%\n\nmale: 70.1%\n\nfemale: 88.3% (2015)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 11 years\n\nmale: 10 years\n\nfemale: 11 years (2015)\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\n\ntotal: 34.4%\n\nmale: NA\n\nfemale: NA (2013 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 24\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: Kingdom of Lesotho\n\nconventional short form: Lesotho\n\nlocal long form: Kingdom of Lesotho\n\nlocal short form: Lesotho\n\nformer: Basutoland\n\netymology: the name translates as \"Land of the Sesotho Speakers\"\n\nGovernment type\n\nparliamentary constitutional monarchy\n\nCapital\n\nname: Maseru\n\ngeographic coordinates: 29 19 S, 27 29 E\n\ntime difference: UTC+2 (7 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)\n\netymology: in the Sesotho language the name means \"[place of] red sandstones\"\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n10 districts;

About three-fourths of the people live in rural areas and engage in animal herding and subsistence agriculture, although Lesotho produces less than 20% of the nation's demand for food. Agriculture is vulnerable to weather and climate variability.Lesotho relies on South Africa for much of its economic activity; Lesotho imports 85% of the goods it consumes from South Africa, including most agricultural inputs. Households depend heavily on remittances from family members working in South Africa in mines, on farms, and as domestic workers, though mining employment has declined substantially since the 1990s. Lesotho is a member of the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and revenues from SACU accounted for roughly 26% of total GDP in 2016; however, SACU revenues are volatile and expected to decline over the next 5 years. Lesotho also gains royalties from the South African Government for water transferred to South Africa from a dam and reservoir system in Lesotho. However, the government continues to strengthen its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties and other transfers.The government maintains a large presence in the economy - government consumption accounted for about 26% of GDP in 2017. The government remains Lesotho's largest employer; in 2016, the government wage bill rose to 23% of GDP – the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho's largest private employer is the textile and garment industry - approximately 36,000 Basotho, mainly women, work in factories producing garments for export to South Africa and the US.

in Lesotho and South Africa, Basotho women and children are subjected to domestic servitude, and Basotho children increasingly endure commercial sexual exploitation; some Basotho men who voluntarily migrate to South Africa for work become victims of forced labor in agriculture and mining or are coerced into committing crimes; foreign nationals continue to traffic fellow citizens in Lesotho\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Lesotho does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, Lesotho was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 because its government has a written plan that, if implemented would constitute making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; the government failed to initiate any prosecutions against alleged traffickers and has not convicted any offenders under the 2011 anti-trafficking act, which remains unimplemented for a fifth year; authorities did not develop formal victim identification and referral procedures, did not establish victim care centers, as required under the 2011 anti-trafficking act, and did not support NGOs offering victims protective services (2015)\n\nFlag of Lesotho\n\nFlag of Lesotho\n\nFlag of Lesotho"
