Exploring Lesotho means slowing down, hiking the hills, and mountain trails, and losing yourself in the immensity of your surroundings. Lesotho is not a big game destination. The allure is the mountain scenery and dramatic landscapes. When punctuated by small game and bird sightings, these destinations are well worth the visit.\n\nSehlabathebe National Park\n\nSehlabathebe National Park, spans an area of over 65 km² in the Qacha’s Neck District, on the border with South Africa’s uKhahlamba-Drakensberg National Park. Established in 1970 as Lesotho's first national park, it became part of the Maluti-Drakensberg World Heritage Site in 2008, underscoring its global significance.\n\nThe park is a haven for hikers, offering a dramatic and rugged landscape adorned with rock arches, outcrops, caves, waterfalls, and pools, set against the magnificent uKhahlamba-Drakensberg escarpment backdrop. Exploring the park's more than 60 San rock-art sites is a rare journey of discovering these very ancient places.\n\nWhile wildlife is scarce, keep an eye out for grey rhebok, eland, Chacama baboons, rock hyraxes, and the main predator in the area, the black-backed jackal. Sehlabathebe hosts no less than four endangered species, the bearded vulture, the Cape vulture, the critically endangered Maluti redfin, and the Sehlabathebe water lily.\n\nTo witness the enchanting beauty of Sehlabathebe National Park, venture out on foot to take in the ancient rock arches, and balancing boulders shrouded in mist. In spring, the rolling grassland comes alive with vibrant wildflowers, adding a splash of color to the dramatic scenery. The park can be visited year-round, with the most beautiful landscapes on display from December to April when the scenery is green, from October to March, afternoon storms are common, and from April to September hiking conditions are perfect, reliably dry, though cold to freezing at night.\n\nTs’ehlanyane National Park\n\nTs'ehlanyane National Park sits at the junction of the Ts'ehlanyane and the Holomo rivers and covers a 2,600 m (8,500 ft) patch of rugged, high-altitude wilderness, including one of Lesotho’s only stands of indigenous forest with a number of rare undergrowth plants that are unique to this woodland habitat.\n\nThere are four major rivers within Ts'ehlanyane National Park, where you will find stands of indigenous old-wood forest, as well as the rare berg bamboo, after which both the river and the park take their name, “Ts'ehlanyane” being the local name for the plant.\n\nThe picturesque valleys contain hiking trails, and natural swimming pools, that are magical to explore on foot or by pony. Ts'ehlanyane is not primarily known for its wildlife, but you may encounter a variety of animals during your walks. The park provides protection to over 20 mammal species, with the magnificent eland, Africa's largest antelope, being the most remarkable. While exploring, keep an eye out ice rat, which thrives in the high-altitude environment.\n\nback to the top quick links\n\nTop Lesotho Destinations, Attractions & Cities\n\nThabana Ntlenyana\n\nThe highest mountain in southern Africa stands tall at 3,482 meters (11,424 ft) within the majestic Maluti Mountains of Lesotho. Its name translates to \"beautiful little mountain\" in the Sesotho language. Thabana Ntlenyana is part of the renowned \"Grand Traverse\" that spans the vast Drakensberg system or can be climbed from Sani Top Chalet or the Vergelegen Nature Reserve.\n\nKatse Dam & Botanical Garden\n\nThe Katse Dam is the centerpiece of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, a remarkable system of dams and tunnels that facilitates the transfer of water through the Lesotho Highlands. The Botanical Garden was originally established to safeguard the spiral aloes affected by the construction of the Katse Dam, and the garden has since flourished into a haven of gravel trails, hillside paths, indigenous flora, a medicinal section, and a captivating viewpoint overlooking the dam.\n\nVisit Semonkong\n\nSemonkong is considered to be Lesotho’s adventure capital. Hiking, pony trekking, mountain biking, fly fishing, rock climbing, as well as abseiling the highest commercial abseil in the world, are all available here.\n\nThe Maletsunyane Falls\n\nAlso known as the Semonkong Falls, at 192 m / 630 ft, is the highest single-drop waterfall in southern Africa. A scenic five-kilometer walk along the Maletsunyane River from Semonkong unveils this captivating waterfall and its breathtaking surroundings. For the more adventurous, at 204 m / 670 ft, the Maletsunyane Falls abseil is the Guinness World Record’s longest commercial abseil in the world.\n\nThaba Bosiu\n\nThaba Bosiu is a sandstone plateau with historical and spiritual significance as the heart of the Sotho Kingdom. Rising to an altitude of 1,800m just 20km east of Maseru, this formidable sandstone plateau served as the residence and military stronghold of Moshoeshoe I, the kingdom's revered founding father, during much of the mid-19th century. According to Sotho oral tradition, Thaba Bosiu, meaning 'Mountain of Night,' was named by Moshoeshoe himself as he and his followers ascended the plateau in the dark, during the chilly midwinter of 1824.\n\nKome Cave Dwellings\n\nThese unique dwellings, built in and against the rock faces from a mixture of rock, mud, and dung, look like traditional Sotho furnaces. The Kome Cave Dwellings is a National Heritage Site worth visiting.\n\nMasitise Ellenberger Cave House\n\nThis brick house, built into the base of an overhanging rock by Reverend David Ellenberger in 1866, is a museum of sorts, and embossed on the ceiling of one of the rooms is a set of dinosaur footprints discovered in the excavation.\n\nDinosaur Foot Prints\n\nLesotho, along with the Karoo in South Africa, is a mecca for paleontologists. There are some excellent dinosaur impressions to be found in rock overhangs, and river beds, with the most recent being discovered in 2016. Top sites include Subeng Stream, Morija, Tsikoane, and Quthing.\n\nSan Rock Art\n\nA stronghold of the San People for thousands of years, these hunter-gathers, now extinct in Lesotho, left hundreds of rock art sites throughout the Maluti Mountains. The most accessible rock art sites are at Ha Baroana east of Maseru, and Liphofung Cultural Centre in Butha Buthe. For the more adventurous, take your 4x4 to the gorgeous Sehlabathebe National Park, which has more than 60 rock art sites.\n\nFly Fishing\n\nThe mountain streams and rivers of Lesotho are stocked with both rainbow and brown trout. Set between beautiful valleys and mountains, for the fly-fishing enthusiast, Lesotho is a highland haven.\n\nGo Skiing in Africa\n\nThanks to its high altitude, Lesotho experiences enough snowfall to offer skiing, snowboarding, and a host of other snow-related activities. The amount of snow does vary year to year, and Afriski and Oxbow Lodge, set in beautiful locations, are worth checking out regardless. Snow season in southern Africa is June, July, and August, and unlike Tiffindell in South Africa, Lesotho depends on nature.\n\nLesotho Cities: Maseru\n\nMaseru, located on the western edge of Lesotho, on the South African border, is the capital city of Lesotho. Maseru serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of Lesotho. About 24 km from King Moshoeshoe’s stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, the British established Maseru as a police garrison in 1869. The strategic location on the border with South Africa meant that even after independence in 1966, Maseru remained the capital. Maseru means “red sandstone” in the Sesotho language.\n\nToday, Maseru serves more as a pit stop than a tourist destination but does have some attractions for the curious to explore. The National Museum provides insight into the history, culture, and art of Lesotho, while the Lesotho Cooperative Handicrafts, Lesotho’s only official visitors center, has become an iconic landmark and takes the form of a Basotho Hat – makorotlo. Inside you can buy an assortment of crafts and gifts from around Lesotho.\n\nFinally, the industrial hub of Thetsane offers a unique glimpse into African industrialization. This bustling area is home to numerous factories producing textiles, t-shirts, and jeans for well-known US retailers like Kmart, Children's Place, and Gap, as well as brands like Levi Strauss, Jonsson, and Puma. The energetic atmosphere of Thetsane provides a stark contrast to the laid-back lifestyle found in other parts of Lesotho.\n\nback to the top quick links\n\nLesotho Safari Travel Guide\n\nBest Time for a Lesotho Safari\n\nLesotho is an all-year-round travel destination with two distinct seasons. The winter months running from April to September are the best months for serious hikers as the conditions are generally dry and clear, with cold nights, and it can snow at any time. On the other hand, the summer months from October to March, are warmer and incredibly scenic with thundershowers and frequent mist. These conditions do make outdoor activities tricky to plan, and places like the Sani Pass, are sometimes closed due to bad weather.\n\nLesotho Weather & Climate\n\nLesotho experiences a temperate climate due to its mountainous terrain. The seasons in Lesotho are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere and split into two distinct categories. Winters, from April to September, and Summers, from October to March. It's important to note that because of the altitude and mountainous terrain, weather conditions can be highly changeable throughout the year.\n\nDuring the winter dry season, which spans from April to September, rain is rare, and the days are characterized by sunny weather. However, temperatures drop significantly, with average daytime temperatures around 18°C/64°F in April. May, June, July, and August are the coldest months, with average afternoon temperatures around 14°C/57°F, and freezing temperatures at night and early mornings. September sees a slight increase in temperatures, with refreshing rains and daily averages ranging from 5°C/41°F at night to 18°C/64°F during the day.\n\nThe wet summer season, from October to March, brings regular rainfall and mist that often envelops the higher altitudes. October marks the settling of dust from the dry season, with morning temperatures around 8°C/46°F and afternoon temperatures around 19°C/66°F. November, December, January, and February are characterized by afternoon thunderstorms, so planning outdoor activities carefully is advisable. Daytime temperatures during this period hover around 23°C/73°F. In March, rainfall starts to diminish, and sunshine becomes more prevalent, with daytime temperatures averaging around 21°C/70°F.\n\nHow Much Does a Lesotho Safari Cost?\n\nAs Lesotho is a small country it is usually visited in conjunction with South Africa and eSwatini tours. The type of safari that you choose to take will depend on your budget, your comfort with large groups and strangers, and the duration of your travels.\n\nThe two biggest factors influencing your Lesotho safari tour will be the duration of your travels and the choice between camping safari or lodge safari.\n\nLarge group overland tours are often the most cost-effective as they spread the cost between the 20-odd people with whom you will share your adventure, meaning that your budget can stretch a lot further. The two broad categories that these Africa safaris fit into are our overland lodge safari and overland camping safari.\n\na 7-day Camping overland tour, from South Africa, departing from Durban, visiting the Drakensberg, Lesotho, and Graffreniet, and ending at Addo Elephant Park, will cost US$ 897*, max group of 20 travelers.\n\nOn the other hand, a 7-day Lodge overland tour, from South Africa, departing from Durban, visiting the Drakensberg, Lesotho, Graffreniet, and ending at Addo Elephant Park, will cost US$ 1258*, max group of 20 travelers.\n\nIt goes without saying that private tours, smaller more intimate group tours, like couples or small family or friend groups, can be more expensive. That said, African Budget Safaris specializes in private bespoke safaris that can be surprisingly affordable.\n\nA 14-day small group lodge safari, max 12 people, taking in Kruger, the panorama route, eSwatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Drakensberg, Lesotho, the Karoo, and ending at Addo Elephant Park, will cost roughly US$ 2684*\n\nA 14-day large group lodge safari, max 20 people, taking in Kruger, the panorama route, eSwatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Drakensberg, Lesotho, the Karoo, and ending at Addo Elephant Park, will cost roughly US$ 2168*\n\nA 14-day large group camping safari, max 20 people, taking in Kruger, the panorama route, eSwatini, KwaZulu-Natal, Drakensberg, Lesotho, the Karoo, and ending at Addo Elephant Park, will cost roughly US$ 1555*\n\nThe above prices illustrate the differences between duration and camping versus lodge safari tours, for up-to-date package costs, contact one of our experienced travel consultants. African Budget Safari offers 12 tours that include Lesotho, eSwatini, and South Africa, with prices ranging from US$ 897 to US$ 3448 per person.

For accurate Africa safari costs, you can talk to one of our African Budget Safari travel consultants here.\n\nback to the top quick links\n\nLesotho: Getting There\n\nMost people add Lesotho to a much longer South African safari itinerary. These overland tours will often take in Kruger, eSwatini, KwaZulu-Natal, and Lesotho, before heading onto the Garden Route and Cape Town. Alternatively, you can rent a car in Johannesburg and do a self-drive tour. Remember a 4x4 will be essential if you plan on entering Lesotho via the Sani Pass, but otherwise a regular car will do. Flights from Johannesburg leave once a day, take around 1 hour, and cost approximately R 2500 / US$ 135 (at the time of publishing).\n\nNo matter how you choose to enter Lesotho, you will need a valid passport, and the relevant supporting documentation.\n\nGetting Around: Transport in Lesotho\n\nWhen visiting the Kingdom of Lesotho, there are a number of travel options available from walking to buses, kombis, and self-drive tours. The best way to explore Lesotho for a short stay is by renting a car to self-drive, or alternatively booking a safari itinerary through a company like African Budget Safaris.\n\nContrary to popular belief, except for the treacherous Sani Pass, you do not need a 4x4 to drive in Lesotho. The roads are generally well-maintained, bar potholes, pedestrians, and animals which are par for the course. The kingdom is however mountainous, involving steep climbs, sharp descents, and gorgeous scenery, all requiring concentration. Petrol can be hard to find in the interior, and it is best to fill up in South Africa or Maseru.\n\nFor locals and the fearless, the most common form of transport is the minibus taxi.\n\nback to the top quick links\n\nLesotho Travel Times & Distances\n\nLesotho is a small but mountainous destination. We’ve used Maseru, and King Mswati III International Airport as the major points of reference, as well as destinations in the north (Malolotja), and south (KaMasholo) to give you an idea of the size. None of these times include border crossings.\n\nJohannesburg to Maseru City: 449 km / 279 miles\n\nThe drive from OR Thambo in Johannesburg, south to Meseru will take you about 5 hours on good roads. Car hire is available to collect from the airport.\n\nFlights from Johannesburg to Moshoeshoe I International Airport, just outside of Maseru, will take 1 hour.\n\nMaseru to Quthing: 176 km / 110 mi\n\nQuthing, in the south of Lesotho, can be reached in roughly 3 hours.\n\nMaseru to Mokhotlong: 291 km / 180 mi 5.5 hours\n\nMokhotlong in the far east of Lesotho takes about 5.5 hours.\n\nMaseru to Semonkong: 114 km / 70 mi\n\nThe adventure capital of Semonkong can be reached in about 2.5 hours\n\nWhat to Wear on Safari in Lesotho\n\nWhen visiting Lesotho, it's essential to be prepared for the changing weather conditions throughout the year. Layered clothing is recommended to adapt to the temperature variations between day and night, especially during the colder winter months. It's also important to stay updated on local weather forecasts and be aware of the potential for thunderstorms during the summer season.\n\nLesotho is a great destination for outdoor enthusiasts and hikers. Be prepared for extreme mountain weather and never underestimate the dangers when doing long multi-day hikes. Be prepared for any weather, and do your research well before you depart. A good pair of hiking boots is essential.\n\nback to the top quick links\n\nFacts About Lesotho\n\nLesotho’s Geography\n\nLesotho, a mountainous landlocked country in Southern Africa, is unique as the only independent state in the world located entirely above 1,000 meters (3,281 ft) in elevation. Its borders span a total length of 909 kilometers (565 mi) and it is completely surrounded by South Africa. Covering an area of approximately 30,355 square kilometers (11,720 sq mi), Lesotho is characterized by a cooler climate due to its high elevation. The country can be divided into three main regions: the lowlands along the Caledon and Senqu rivers, the highlands formed by the Drakensberg and Maloti mountain ranges, and the foothills that separate the lowlands from the highlands.\n\nLesotho's highest point is Thabana Ntlenyana, reaching an elevation of 3,482 meters (11,424 ft), while over 80% of the country lies above 1,800 meters (5,906 ft). Although Lesotho has limited water coverage, its rivers play a crucial role in the economy, with water being a significant export and a source of hydroelectricity. The Orange River, originating in the Drakensberg mountains, traverses the entire length of the country before exiting to South Africa, while the Caledon River marks part of the northwestern border. Other notable rivers include the Malibamatso, Matsoku, and Senqunyane. The geological composition of Lesotho consists mainly of shale and sandstone from the Karoo Supergroup.\n\nIn the highlands of Lesotho, peatlands can be found, particularly near the eastern border, along with solifluction deposits, blockfields, block streams, and stone garlands formed during the last glacial period. Despite its small size, Lesotho's natural features and unique geography contribute to its distinctiveness and serve as important elements of its economy and ecosystem.\n\nLesotho History & Economy\n\nBasutoland, under the leadership of King Moshoeshoe I, emerged as a unified state in 1822. The formation of Basutoland resulted from Moshoeshoe's establishment of his own clan and his alliance with former adversaries against the Lifaqane associated with Shaka Zulu's reign. The state's development continued with conflicts, and alliances involving British, Dutch, missionaries, and trekboers, until 1868, when Basutoland became a British protectorate. Basutoland later became a Crown colony in 1884, retaining tribal chiefs' internal authority.\n\nBasutoland gained independence from the UK in 1966, becoming Lesotho. Political turmoil followed, including a coup in 1970 and rebel training in Libya. In 1986, a coup ousted the leader, granting powers to King Moshoeshoe II. A democratically elected government took over in 1993 but faced unrest and a coup attempt in 1994. After negotiations, the ousted government was reinstated, and Letsie III abdicated in favor of his father. More protests and clashes in 1998 were followed by elections in 2002, won by the Lesotho Congress for Democracy. Subsequent years saw various political developments, including a 2014 coup attempt and leadership changes. Sam Matekane became prime minister in 2022 after winning the elections with his Revolution for Prosperity party.\n\nLesotho's economy relies on agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and mining, as well as workers' remittances and revenues from the Southern African Customs Union. The majority of households engage in farming, and the agricultural sector contributes nearly two-thirds of the country's income. Lesotho has become a leading exporter of garments to the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), with major US brands sourcing from the country. Water and diamonds are valuable natural resources, with the Lesotho Highlands Water Project ensuring self-sufficiency in electricity production and generating significant revenue from South Africa. The mining sector, particularly the Letšeng mine, produces high-value diamonds.
