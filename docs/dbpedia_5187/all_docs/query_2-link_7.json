        "text": "Overview of Lesotho\n\nThe mountainous Kingdom of Lesotho is small and rounded in shape, enclosed by South Africa on all sides. Separated from its neighbour by the huge Drakensberg and Maluti ranges, it's situated on a plateau over 3,281 feet (1,000m) high and has peaks reaching summits of more than 10,000 feet (3,000m).\n\nSani Pass is a breathtaking entry-point into Lesotho from South Africa's Drakensberg National Park and acts as a the gateway to the Roof of Africa scenic route, linking the magnificent scenery of the two mountain ranges. Popularly described as the 'Kingdom in the Sky', the lofty highlands of Lesotho are characterised by majestic mountain scenery, crisp mountain air, and the simple serenity of the traditional lifestyles of its people.\n\nPony trekking is one of the finest ways to experience the Lesotho highlands, with time spent in remote Basotho villages scattered among the grassy hills. Here, waterfalls saturate the surrounding rocks with rainbow-coloured mist and crystal clear streams criss-cross the landscape. The region is also perfect for those who prefer to put their hiking skills to the test, with miles of solitary scenery to appreciate, an abundance of trout in the rivers and dams, and the assurance of a warm and friendly welcome in the rugged mountain hamlets. The central highlands are home to the highest waterfall in southern Africa, the Maletsunyane Falls near Semonkong. Meaning 'Place of Smoke', it thunders from a height of 624ft (190m) and is at its most spectacular during the summer rainy season.\n\nThe land descends from the top of the Maluti Mountains down to the western lowlands, which contain all major towns and around two thirds of the population. Maseru, the capital, is a fascinating city of contrasting modern and traditional lifestyles, where blanket-clad horsemen sidestep the traffic jams on their way to market, and woven handicrafts sit displayed on the busy pavements outside new glass buildings filled with hardworking office employees and officials. Time spent in Lesotho will allow visitors to observe an African country that has extraordinary appeal: a kingdom of rugged beauty and unchanging culture that remains pristine and largely unaffected by tourism.\n\nKey Facts\n\nLanguage:\n\nSesotho and English are the official languages, but Xhosa and Zulu are widely spoken.\n\nPassport/Visa:\n\nAll foreign passengers to Lesotho must hold return or onward tickets, the necessary travel documentation for their next destination, and sufficient funds to cover their expenses while in the country. Visa-exempt visitors who wish to stay in Lesotho for longer than their allotted 14 days, should apply for extensions at the Lesotho Immigration Authorities within the initial 14-day period. It is highly recommended that travellers' passports have at least six months' validity remaining after the intended date of departure from their travel destination. Immigration officials often apply different rules to those stated by travel agents and official sources.\n\nCurrency:\n\nThe Lesotho loti (LSL) is the official currency of Lesotho, and is divided into 100 lisente. It has the same value as the South African rand, which is accepted as legal currency. Banks and exchange bureaus are found in Maseru and in most main towns.\n\nMost major hotels, shops, restaurants, and travel agencies accept credit cards, though it is best to check with credit and debit card companies as to their acceptance before leaving home. Local ATMs in Lesotho have the facility to accept international ATM cards but are unreliable.\n\nElectricity:\n\nElectrical current is 220 volts, 50Hz. The three-prong, round pin South African plug is used.\n\nTravel to Lesotho\n\nOverview\n\nKnown as the Mountain Kingdom, Lesotho boasts some of the most scenic mountain peaks in Southern Africa, making it an ideal destination for travellers who love the outdoors, fresh air, and wide open spaces. The lush and beautiful landscape allows for many things to see and do in Lesotho. Sought-after activities include birdwatching and wildlife safaris, offered at the likes of Sehlabathebe National Park. It's a nature reserve made up of 6,500 hectares and positioned at an elevation of 7,874 feet (2,400m). This protected wilderness area is the ideal spot for hiking, pony-trekking, and scenic explorations. While game sightings are limited to antelope, the landscapes and natural wonders are more than enough to excite lovers of the outdoors.\n\nAnother tourist favourite in Lesotho is Thaba-Bosiu. This sandstone plateau is a national monument and considered the birthplace of the Basotho nation. It's worth a visit for its history and spectacular views. From Thaba-Bosiu, travellers can see the Qiloane pinnacle, which was the inspiration for Lesotho's celebrated hat, the mokorotlo. While there are water sports aplenty at the great Katse Dam in the summer months, skiing in the Maloti Mountains during the winter months is a big drawcard for tourists the world over. Skiing in Lesotho offers travellers a unique winter experience not usually found in Africa.\n\nFor the culturally inclined, other tourist attractions in Lesotho include a chance to delve into history at the Lesotho National Museum in Maseru and the Morija Museum and Archives, which offer collections on archaeology, ethnography, and geology. Visitors can also discover the Kome Cave Dwellings, now a National Heritage Site where the rich culture of Lesotho's people is contained. Rock art is also a popular find in Lesotho, as are the famed Dinosaur Footprints found at Morija, Subeng Stream, and Tsikoane, to name a few.\n\nClimate in Lesotho\n\nWeather conditions in Lesotho vary greatly depending on the altitude. Summer (October to April) is the hot, rainy season, with the hottest days in January and February, and the most rain falling between March and May and between October and November.\n\nDays are sunny with electric afternoon thunderstorms, and temperatures range from around 86ºF (30°C) in the lowlands. Temperatures cool down as the altitude increases, averaging about 64°F (18°C) in the mountains. Snow falls mainly in winter from May to September, but can occur in the mountains at any time of year.\n\nWinter can be bitterly cold, particularly in the highlands, but days are usually clear and sunny. Temperatures can fall to 20°F (-7°C) in the lowlands and 0°F (-18°C) in the highlands. At any time of year, the weather can change very rapidly in the highlands, from warm sunshine to mist, rain and freezing temperatures.\n\nHealth Notes when travelling to Lesotho\n\nLesotho's high altitude and crisp mountain air does not present many health problems for travellers, although the high elevation does make altitude sickness a possibility for recently arrived visitors. Everyone 12 years of age and older should get fully vaccinated for COVID-19 before visting; water should not be drunk unless it is boiled or filtered.\n\nThere is a lack of good medical facilities, and medical attention is often sought in neighbouring South Africa. Visitors should carry a personal supply of medicine as supplies are limited. Lesotho's Flying Doctor service provides emergency medical services to remote parts of the country. Medical insurance is essential and should include emergency air evacuation coverage, especially if visitors are planning to spend time in remote mountainous regions.\n\nSafety Notes when travelling to Lesotho\n\nSafety in Lesotho is not generally a serious issue but there has been an increase in opportunistic crime and gun-related crimes, due to a high unemployment rate in the cities. Most incidents occur in Maseru, but visitors should also be alert elsewhere to theft, car hijackings, and muggings. Visitors should avoid walking around with valuables or should keep them out of sight. It's best not to walk alone in isolated areas or in Maseru after dark; driving through rural areas after dark is also not recommended. Sporadic demonstrations are possible and should be avoided if possible.\n\nCustoms in Lesotho\n\nPoliteness is very much appreciated in Lesotho, and it is always best to ask before taking pictures of places or people. It is customary to ask permission from the local village Headman or Chief before camping, and to inform him if spending any time within his village. Homosexuality is illegal so visitors should be cautious and discreet.\n\nDuty Free in Lesotho\n\nTravellers to Lesotho do not have to pay duty on 200 cigarettes, 20 cigars, and 250g tobacco; 2 litres wine and 1 litre of alcohol; 250ml eau de toilette and 50ml perfume; other gifts to the value of LSL 5000. No liquor may be imported by South African nationals.\n\nDoing Business in Lesotho\n\nBusiness in Lesotho tends to follow usual business practices, meaning it's best to be punctual, exchange business cards, and show respect for hosts. However, foreigners should anticipate a generally relaxed atmosphere. Suits and ties are the norm, though a lightweight material is best. Business hours are usually from 8.30am to 12.30pm and 2pm to 4.30pm Mondays to Fridays, and 8am to 1pm on Saturdays.\n\nCommunication in Lesotho\n\nThe international dialling code for Lesotho is +266, and the outgoing code is 00 followed by the relevant country code (e.g. 0027 for South Africa). Telephone and fax services are available in all main towns and at major hotels. Visitors can purchase local prepaid SIM cards for unlocked phones; WiFi is available in cafes, restaurants and hotels in cities.\n\nTipping in Lesotho\n\nAll service staff, including tour guides and game rangers, are customarily tipped between 10 and 15 percent, which they rely on to boost their low wages.\n\nPassport/Visa Note\n\nAll foreign passengers to Lesotho must hold return or onward tickets, the necessary travel documentation for their next destination, and sufficient funds to cover their expenses while in the country. Visa-exempt visitors who wish to stay in Lesotho for longer than their allotted 14 days, should apply for extensions at the Lesotho Immigration Authorities within the initial 14-day period. It is highly recommended that travellers' passports have at least six months' validity remaining after the intended date of departure from their travel destination. Immigration officials often apply different rules to those stated by travel agents and official sources.\n\nEntry Requirements\n\nEntry requirements for Americans:\n\nUS citizens must have a passport that is valid upon their arrival in Lesotho.
