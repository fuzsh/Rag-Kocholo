        "text": "4. The Agricultural Sector in the Lesotho Economy\n\nAgriculture in Lesotho is the key sector and a major source of employment within the country. As shown above approximately 81 percent of the population live in rural areas and about 60 to 70 percent of the country's labour force obtain supplemental income from agriculture. However, Lesotho�s agriculture is characterised by low and declining production. The contribution of agriculture to GNP declined from 22 percent in 1971 to 11 percent in 1988 (Bureau of Statistics, 1992). Similarly the contribution of agriculture to GDP decreased from 50 percent in 1974 to 22 percent in 1984 (Ministry of Economic Planning, 1987). In the period 1990-1995 the share of agriculture in GNP averaged 11 percent.\n\nThe agricultural sector is increasingly being dominated by livestock activities (Figure 2). In 1966, crop production contributed approximately 60 percent of the value of agricultural output with livestock contributing 40 percent. By 1984, crop production contribution had declined to 22 percent while livestock contribution increased to 78 percent. The contribution of crop production in the agricultural sector peaked in 1990/91 because of favourable weather conditions. The contribution of livestock to agriculture peaked in 1992/93 while crop contribution was at the lowest mainly due to drought.\n\nLand Tenure\n\nIn Lesotho land belongs to the Basotho nation and the King holds it in trust for the people. The administration of land is by chiefs and headmen who administer land on behalf of the King. The underlying concept of the customary land tenure system is that land is a national and social asset to be utilised for the benefit of the nation. The system entitles all households to have access to land for residential and agricultural purposes.\n\nLand Use Rights to Residential and Crop Land\n\nTo be allocated land an applicant has to be a married male Mosotho, accept the superior and overall authority of the King. To be allocated a residential site an applicant must show good behaviour and loyalty to the chief. To be allocated agricultural land the applicant must have a prior residential allocation. This is important because without a residence there can be no claim to arable land, grazing, reeds, or thatching grass. Once land is allocated, the recipient has certain rights to use the land in his lifetime. Cultivation of arable land is one of the requirements for retaining use of the land. If the allocatee either fails to cultivate fields of two successive years or cultivates fields improperly, the chief may reallocate the land. Furthermore individuals who have more land than their subsistence needs require can be deprived of the land. Both these are, however, uncommon in practice.\n\nEvery married male has the right to be allocated a portion of arable land to provide for his subsistence and that of his dependants. In the past, households were allocated three fields, which in most cases were situated in different locations around the village. It is thought that fragmentation of fields originated in the traditional doctrine of equity and the realisation that the risk of total crop loss from natural disasters could be reduced (Williams, 1972). In addition fragmentation meant that a household's fields were not located only in poor lands by spreading the allocation over poor and good soils. It has been hypothesised that each field was for maize, sorghum and wheat (Williams, 1972). The other explanation for the allocation of three fields is that the first field was for paying tax, the second for the home and the third for the children (LASA, 1978). In polygamous households the man or the head of the household was allocated three fields with two more fields provided for each additional wife. Another explanation is that the practice was designed to ensure that all community members had an equitable distribution of fields in terms of the distance from the homestead.\n\nA landholder�s rights to arable land are seasonal. When the land is cultivated the owner has exclusive rights to that land. After the crop is harvested the land becomes open access whereby anybody can exercise secondary rights of grazing animals, under the practice of Mohoang which involves community livestock sequentially grazing stover from one field to the next. In addition anybody can collect the stover for fuel, wild vegetables, dung for fuel and plastering etc. The practice of Mohoang is becoming less prevalent. Nowadays it is common for landowners to cut the maize or sorghum stalks for their private use or to exclusively graze the stover in situ.\n\nWith increasing population pressure, arable landlessness has been increasing. According to the 1970 Census of Agriculture, landless households accounted for 13 percent of the total population in 1970; this increased to 25 percent in 1986 (Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Agriculture, 1990). In FY86/87, 16 percent of the rural households reported having no fields and livestock (Bureau of Statistics, 1988).\n\nLand Use Rights to Cattle Posts and Village Grazing Areas\n\nThe Mountain rangeland is divided into 22 ward areas controlled by Lesotho�s 22 principal or ward chiefs. A household wishing to establish a permanent cattle post applies to the principal chief for an access permit into the highland cattle post. Access to highland rangeland entitles the stockholder to graze anywhere in the rangeland held by the principal chief. Access to highland pasture does not entitle one to prevent entry by others, however. Once a cattle post is established, feasible livestock walking distances and managerial expedience determines the size of the area available to the stockholder.\n\nLesotho villages were initially developed on areas comprising cropland, woodlands, grasslands, and a supply of fresh drinking water within walking distance. The purpose of village grazing land was to complement agriculture by providing agricultural land through land conversions as well as providing forage for draft animals. Unlike the cattle post regime, no formal permission is required for pasturing livestock. The only requirement is ownership of livestock and residency in the village controlling the pasture. The grazing area is managed through a system called leboella. This is a rotational system in which the chief divides the grazing area into parcels. At any one time, only one parcel is open for grazing while the remaining parcels are allowed to recover.\n\nIn order to address the land tenure system in the country the 1979 Land Act was introduced. This Act introduces the leasehold system of land tenure. The major purpose of the Act is to promote agricultural production through equitable distribution to households interested in increasing agricultural output. The Act provides for the establishment of Selected Agricultural Areas (SAAs) which are designated by Government for agricultural development purposes. The traditional laws and practices relating to land use and tenure have prevailed to this day, despite the enactment of the 1979 Land Act, which has remained largely unimplemented.\n\nCrop Production\n\nThe major crops grown in Lesotho are maize, wheat, sorghum, beans and peas. Grains are the most important crops in terms of area allocated to crop production. The average area allocated to grain production was 75 percent of the total arable in the country during FY73/74-FY88/89 period (Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Agriculture, 1994). Most crops are grown during summer. Wheat and peas are grown in summer and winter. Winter wheat and peas are grown in the Lowlands while summer wheat and peas are grown in the Mountains. Crop production is characterised by a high proportion of subsistence farming, with over 70 percent being consumed and not marketed.\n\nLesotho�s crop agriculture has experienced continuous declines since 1978/79. The causes of the declining crop production include drought, low yields, low fertiliser application rates, low and erratic rainfall, hail, frost, and soil erosion. Lesotho is increasingly relying on imports as a result of the low and declining crop production. The imports are mainly from South Africa.\n\nOne peculiar thing is that even though population pressure on arable land is increasing a large proportion of arable land is left fallow each year. Even though there is increasing pressure on arable land, land under cultivation declined from 450,000 ha in 1960 to 310,000 ha in 1988 (Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Agriculture, 1990). There is also increasing fallow land. Between FY73/74 and FY88/89 fallow land averaged 20 percent of the total arable land per year.\n\nLivestock Production\n\nThe Lesotho's livestock sector consists of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, pigs, and poultry. Livestock are kept for both economic and social reasons. Cattle are raised for mostly subsistence use including draught power, milk, fuel (dung), and meat. Cattle are also kept for socio-cultural uses such as bohali (bride-wealth) and ceremonies. The sheep are of the merino type and are raised for the sale of their wool, slaughter as well as for ceremonial purposes. The goats are of the Angora type and are raised for the sale of mohair and ceremonial purposes. Horses and donkeys mostly serve transportation functions in the remote rugged interior of the country. Donkeys are used for transporting goods while horses are used for human transportation. The largest single monetary contribution to cash income from livestock is that provided by sales of wool and mohair. Wool and mohair are also the major agricultural exports from Lesotho. Table 7 shows the trend in livestock numbers in Lesotho.\n\nTable 7: Number of Livestock in Lesotho (�000)\n\nYear\n\nCattle\n\nSheep\n\nGoats\n\nHorses\n\nNT FACE=\"Garamond\">\n\nDonkeys\n\n1985/86\n\n525\n\n1,392\n\n978\n\n110\n\n112\n\n1986/87\n\n627\n\n1,703\n\n1,150\n\n127\n\n136\n\n1987/88\n\n627\n\n1,645\n\n1,121\n\n129\n\n148\n\n1988/89\n\n583\n\n1,501\n\n1,064\n\n116\n\n131\n\n1989/90\n\n523\n\n1,377\n\n995\n\n104\n\n151\n\n1990/91\n\n543\n\n1,481\n\n730\n\n98\n\n110\n\n1991/92\n\n700\n\n1,383\n\n649\n\n89\n\n-\n\n1992/93\n\n658\n\n1,176\n\n811\n\n107\n\n139\n\n1993/94\n\n578\n\n1,277\n\n876\n\n113\n\n140\n\n1994/95\n\n580\n\n1,131\n\n749\n\n100\n\n146\n\nSource: Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Agriculture. 1996.\n\nThe livestock sub-sector is dominated by small holders with the average number of cattle, sheep and goats per household being 3, 43, and 25, respectively (Mochebelele and Mokitimi, 1992). The ownership of livestock is skewed. Approximately 8 percent of the households are estimated to own half the country's livestock. This figure might be slightly higher because of the practice of mafisa. In Lesotho, ownership of livestock needs to be distinguished from use or herding because of the widespread practice of mafisa which is a system of livestock borrowing and lending which generally gives the holder of the animals rights to wool, mohair, milk and draught power while the owner retains title to the inventory and progeny.\n\nThe major problems facing the Lesotho livestock sector is range deterioration as a result of overstocking. Overstocking also affects livestock productivity. The poor nutrition as a result of overstocking gives rise to low reproductive rates, milk production, draught power, and fleece weights and ultimately low incomes from livestock production.\n\nRange Utilisation and Management\n\nAbout 80 percent of Lesotho�s land area may be regarded as rangeland. Communities enjoy usufructuary rights. Although rangelands in Lesotho are open-access resource, communities have defined territorial boundaries where they can graze their animals. The Lesotho livestock system is characterised by the practice of transhumance; livestock are moved to the cattle posts in the mountains in summer and then moved to the lowlands in winter. In the mountains, livestock are moved to lower elevation areas or valleys in winter. The seasonal movement of livestock from the Lowlands to the Mountains is becoming one of the major causes of overstocking in the mountains.\n\nChiefs are responsible for administering range utilisation. Village chiefs are responsible for village grazing areas and principal chiefs are responsible for cattle post grazing areas. Chiefs are also responsible for the administration of maboella. The system of maboella involves reserving certain parts of village rangelands for the rejuvenation of grass, protection of thatching grass, reed beds, tree planting, and rotational grazing. Maboella is practised in most cases during the summer months. The main purpose of maboella is to reserve areas of thatching grass and croplands from grazing during the summer months. The grasses may not be grazed until they have been cut in July or August. Maboella are usually declared as soon as crops and thatching grasses have attained sufficient growth to attract animals. The opening of maboella is generally when harvesting is completed though the range maboella are normally declared open much earlier.\n\nThe Laws of Lerotholi (Melao ea Lerotholi, 1959) explicitly point out that grazing permits are required for cattle post areas. The purpose of grazing permits is to monitor the movements of livestock to cattle posts and thus make it possible to graze each particular area in accordance with its carrying capacity. Grazing permits are issued by, or on behalf of the principal chiefs and specify the number of animals which may be moved to a cattle post, the permitted location of grazing within a dip tank area, and the number of animals which may be grazed.\n\nIn recent times the government has introduced Village Development Councils (VDCs) with one of their responsibilities being the management of rangelands. Chiefs who see this as a way of encroaching on their powers have opposed this move. This has resulted in conflicts over the management of rangelands, which have recently led to loss of human life.\n\nOne of major environmental problems facing Lesotho is overgrazing which is caused by overstocking. Estimates of overstocking range between 50 and 300 percent. The various measures undertaken in Lesotho are designed to control livestock number so as to balance stocking rates with carrying capacities. The approach to range management in Lesotho is based on range succession model. The succession model uses stocking rates as the main management tool. The government of Lesotho has intervened in the administration of rangelands through legislation. The Land Husbandry Act 1969 empowers the Minister of Agriculture to make regulations to ensure proper conservation and management of agricultural land. A series of range management and grazing control regulations followed. These include Grazing Control and Pasture Management Regulations 1973 and Grazing Control and management regulations of 1977 (Dobb, 1985). These were followed by the Range Management and Grazing Control Regulations of 1980. The 1980 regulations were amended in 1986 by introducing stiffer penalties for range encroachment.\n\nThe Government and donor community felt that the chieftaincy had become incapable of managing rangelands effectively and as a result introduced Grazing Associations, which operate in Range Management Areas (RMAs). It is envisaged that if management is given to livestock owners themselves, effective management and conservation would increase since they have vested interests. The first RMA was established in 1978 and since that time several RMAs have been established.\n\nThe Government of Lesotho has also tried to control the importation of livestock through import taxes. Livestock import taxes were introduced in 1984 as a means of controlling the importation of animals. In the 1970s wages in the RSA mines increased significantly and Basotho miners invested the most of their earnings in purchasing cattle. The imports of cattle increased by 1,400 percent between 1976 and 1980. Under the Agricultural Marketing (Livestock Import Fees) regulations 1984 as amended, import fees are to be paid. There has been a significant reduction in livestock imports since 1984. Government has also embarked on the Livestock Exchange and Small Stock Culling Programmes. The Livestock Exchange Programme involves female goats for breeding purposes. In this programme a farmer is given 2 pure-bred angora goats in exchange for 3 unimproved goats. The programme is financed through the EU-supported Stabex programme. The Small Stock Culling Programme involves the removal of coloured, and old and unproductive sheep and goats from the range. Government has also attempted to introduce grazing fees in order to reduce livestock numbers. However, this has never been implemented.\n\n5. Study Area\n\nPhysical Description\n\nThe Pelaneng-Bokong Range Management Area (RMA) is located in the mountain zone of Leribe district within the watershed of the western side of the Malibamat�o River (Figure 3). Two other rivers are important to the hydrological systems of the RMA. The Pelaneng river drains the northern third of the RMA while Bokong/Bokoaneng systems traversing through the centre of the RMA and joins the Malibamat�o river at the southern tip of the RMA. Elevations range between 1,900 metres at Ha Sepinare in the south to 3,198 metres at Pel�a T�oeu on the escarpment in the northern cattle post area. The topography over most of the area is very steep and highly dissected. slopes in excess of 60 percent are common on the winter ranges in the valleys west of the villages.\n\nThe RMA is about 35,949 ha in size. Of this, roughly 12,000 ha is considered cattle post grazing. The remaining area is composed primarily of village or winter grazing area. A small portion of the village areas is arable and residential land. The forms of land use are readily apparent: residential, cropland and village grazing areas (approx. 20 percent); summer grazing land (approx. 38 percent) on the highland parts of the RMA drop steeply to the east towards the Malibamat�o river into winter grazing land (approx. 42 percent). The village grazing areas, Malibamat�o river which forms the eastern boundary of the RMA. According to the Grazing Association�s records of April 1998, there were 7,127 cattle, 349 horses, 11 mules, 723 donkeys, 11, 879 sheep, and 9,787 goats.\n\nOur study area also comprises of an off-RMA site of approximately equal size and socio-economic characteristics. However, in the off-RMA site the grazing and livestock management are traditional.\n\nSocio-economic Conditions\n\nThe RMA contains 17 villages organised under 4 area chiefs. The 1986 demographic data indicates that the area had a population of 5,397 persons with 1,058 households (MoA Report). A total of 700 households are members of the association managing the RMA. The most important economic activity is agriculture with livestock being the major component. The climatic conditions and physiography impose serious constraints on crop farming. Approximately, 74 percent of the households within the RMA manage livestock. In this group, 19 percent of the households are female head.\n\nThe Lesotho Highland Water Project has opened access to this remote area of the country. As a result many socio-economic services such as clinics, schools, and businesses have improved.\n\nFigure 3: Map of the Research Site\n\nScale: 1:250,000\n\nA Summary of Basic Biophysical Data from Lesotho, Collated by the Spanish Team\n\nThe Spanish Team has vast experience of temperate zone mountains but no direct data from Southern Africa. This section outlines how we propose to gather climatic and hydrological data.\n\nClimate and Hydrology\n\nRough climatic data can be obtained from different sources. Climatic atlases of the world or of Africa are available. More detailed maps are supplied by the papers and book by R. Schulze from South Africa. However, these data are unsuitable, as Lesotho is a very rugged country, where topoclimatic effects are important, and where measurements can differ widely between very close points. Regional climatic measurements have been taken from a chapter on climate, by Schulze, in the book edited recently by Cowling et al. on the vegetation of Southern Africa. The summary of the data (mainly climatic data but also some soil and vegetation data) for Lesotho are given below:\n\nMean daily solar radiation for January: 26-34 MJm-2d-1. (28-30 in the selected sites)\n\nSame variable for July: 14-18 MJm-2d-1 (16-18)\n\nMean annual temperature: 10-16 �C (12-14)\n\nMean of daily maximum temperature in January: 20-30 �C (22.5-25)\n\nMean of daily minimum temperature in July: -2 +2 �C (-2 - 0)\n\nDiurnal temperature ranges in January: 10 - 16 �C (12 - 14)\n\nDiurnal temperature ranges in July: 10 - 16 �C (12 - 14)\n\nAverage date of the first frost:1 - 31 March (1 - 15 March)\n\nAverage duration of period with frosts: Over 200 days (over 225 days)\n\nMean annual precipitation: 500 - 1250 mm (500 - 750 mm)\n\nCoefficient of variation of precipitation: 20 - 35 % (25 - 30)\n\nCoefficient of concentration of precipitation : 30 - 60 % (30 - 50)\n\nRainfall seasonality: January-February (January)\n\nInterception loss for natural vegetation: 1 - 2 mm rainday-1 (1 - 1.5)\n\nLightning ground density: 4 - 20 flashes km -2 yr-1 (4 - 8)\n\nPotential annual evaporation: 1200 - 2200 mm (1750 - 2000)\n\nPotential January evaporation: 100 - 250 mm (200 - 250)\n\nPotential July evaporation: 80 - 140 mm (100 - 120)\n\nPercentage of days with soil moisture stress in January: 20 - 80 % (60 - 70 %)\n\nPercentage of days with soil moisture stress in July: 80 - 100 % (80 - 90)\n\nMean annual primary production: 6 - 15 t ha -1 season-1 (8 - 12)\n\nInterannual variability of net primary production: 20 - 50 % (30 - 40).\n\nAdditional data can be obtained from the book by Chakela (1981), which includes valuable data on climate, soils and vegetation for the Roma and Maliele catchments in Lesotho. While these areas may be representative of the whole country, the data are not useful for the Bokong catchment, which has a much higher altitude. Nevertheless the data can be included for regional syntheses. According to Chakela, the mean annual temperature at Roma is about 15�C, with monthly values between 7�C in July and 22�C in January. For the Leribe station, corresponding data are 13.5�C, 7�C (in June) and 19.5�C (in January). Also given are data from Maputsoe station (14, 7 and 20�C respectively). Rainfall data are also useful for the broader, regional studies. In Roma, the annual values range between 520 and 1300 mm, with most of the rain recorded between October and March. Rainfall events are quite irregular, with coefficients of variation ranging from 50 to 150%. For Leribe, the average rainfall is 815 mm/year, reaching peaks of 1350 mm (1909) and lows of less than 500 mm (1965). Coefficients of variation are as high as in the Roma catchment or even higher. The book by Chakela includes data on soils and soil loss in the studied catchments, but these are of doubtful utility for other catchments or for regional syntheses.\n\nThe hydrological map of Lesotho provides another source of data. This map, by Arduino, Bono and Del Sette, was issued in 1994 as a by-product of the Highland Water Project. It includes not only hydrologic data but also geologic and climatic information. The scale, 1:300 000, is detailed enough to supply some useful data at the catchment level, but is not sufficient for modelling. The map shows the lithologic background of the country, which is mostly covered by the so-called Lesotho formation, a layer of amygdaloid basalt forming fissured rocks, with a thickness attaining 1600 m and having moderate to low water potential.\n\nRainfall\n\nThe map also includes smaller maps of the rainfall distribution in Lesotho, as well as tables of temperature data for 46 stations and the flow of selected rivers. For the whole of Lesotho, precipitation is 769 mm/year, with the highest amount recorded in January (about 120 mm) and the lowest in June and July (15 mm each). The highest rainfall and snowfall values are recorded from the mountain range in the north and from the range that divides the main catchments of the rivers Senqu (Orange) and Mohokare (Caledon). The study site is located close to this divide, and it is expected that it experiences high precipitation. According to the maps, the amount of rainfall in the study area is about 900 mm/year (600 mm/year of effective precipitation). A rainfall time series of about 65 years' duration is available for six stations. Of these, the closest to the study area is the Paray Mission station, at only 22 km from the lowest point of the Bokong catchment, and at an altitude of 2160 m. The mean annual precipitation over the last 65 years is 609 mm. Five- year running means range between 500 and 900 mm, with a peak of 1250 mm in 1937 and a low of 250 mm in the year 1991. A linear regression fit between elevation and rainfall for the Senqu catchment is also presented in the map; from this, the expected rainfall in the middle of Bokong river is about 1000 mm/year but, given the data of the Paray Mission station, perhaps the expected rainfall should be a bit less than that.\n\nMean rainfall data are available for a station closer than the former to the study site. It is the Rampai Pass station, in the Malibamat�o watershed, at an elevation of 2300 m. The distance to the upper reaches of Bokong watershed is only about 10 km, and the elevation is similar to that of the study location. The annual rainfall there is 850 mm, which is close to the value suggested from the Paray Mission station. Monthly distribution of precipitation shows that most precipitation occurs in January (134 mm) and the lowest in July (12 mm). The data series of 59 years is reliable enough.\n\nTemperature\n\nTemperature data are much more scarce than rainfall data. There are records for several stations, including the Rampai Pass. The only data found to date is the mean annual temperature of 10.8�C. The mean temperatures at the study site should be slightly lower. The data are insufficient for modelling purposes but at least allow an estimate of evapotranspiration rate to be made - it amounts to 517 mm/year at Rampai Pass. The difference between the mean rainfall and this value is 333 mm, 39% of the total precipitation. Availability of water is, therefore, higher than the average for the country but the rugged, steep terrain limits the availability of water for the plants. The lack of monthly temperature data prevents an estimate of many climatic indexes and the bioclimatic characterisation of the study area being made. Using the few climatic indexes that are computable (Köppen, Lang, Thornwaite, etc), the Bokong catchment appears to belong to the climatically- humid areas. Gaussen's bioclimatic classification assigns this area to the temperate- climate group and, within this, to the mesoxerochimenic climate, with 3-4 dry or cold months and mean temperature below 15�C. The difficulty with calculations from indexes and classifications is that the expected vegetation under the climatic conditions described is a permanent forest. However, there are no forests in Lesotho! Perhaps the steep slopes or the soil features explain their absence.\n\nSome monthly temperature data exist for three mountain sites. The altitude of these sites is similar to that of the Bokong valley, between 2250 - 3050 m. These are in the north-east of the country, at the Oxbow point, which will be referred to later in the context of flow data, and are closest to the Bokong Catchment. Oxbow lies at the head of the Malibamat�o River, at 2630 m. At Mokothlong (2250 m), mean monthly temperatures are above 0�C throughout the year, with the absolute maxima being recorded in January (24.7�C). Minima below 0�C are recorded in June, July and August, bringing the risk of frost for about three months of the year. Absolute minimum is -3.5�C. For Oxbow, the means are also always above 0�C but the absolute maxima, also in January, is recorded at 18.2�C, with the absolute minimum recorded being -5.9�C in July; the months of frost are May to September. At Letseng-la-Draai (3050 m), means are above 0�C (although the June mean is only 0.2�C), maximum is 16.4�C and there are 6 months that have the possibility of frost, from April to September.\n\nA good characterisation of the Lesotho mountain climate is possible, using the monthly data. At low elevations (about 2000 m), mean monthly temperatures fall below 5�C only in July, there are slight thermic limitations to plant growth, and plants may suffer from occasional frosts between June and August. There are some limitations due to lack of water during the dry season in the driest points. At Mokothlong, where the humidity index of Emberger is 98, there is a dry period, mainly in July and August. At Oxbow, with lower mean temperatures and higher precipitations, there is no dry period at all (the Emberger humidity index is greater than 430) but there is a clear thermic limitation to plant growth from April to September, when mean monthly temperatures are below 7.5�C. During the same period, frosts are likely, at least when there is no snow but at 2600 m.a.s.l. there is usually a snow cover during that period, at least on south-facing slopes.\n\nWind\n\nThe hydrological map of the country also includes some wind data. Lesotho is not very windy - in fact, it is calm for 62 % of the time. Dominant winds come from the west, north or south, with a rare touch of easterly winds. This asymmetry, combined with the orientation of the main mountain ranges, creates a clear windward-leeward effect, which affect the precipitation and vegetation distribution. Most of the country is exposed to the wind from the dry Kalahari, and sheltered from wet, Indian Ocean winds. This also explains the relative aridity of the area. The Bokong River runs north-south but the catchment is surrounded by mountains on all four sides.\n\nRiver Flow\n\nThere are a number of gauging stations across Lesotho, recording data mainly for the Highlands Water Project. One of these stations lies just next to the outlet of the Bokong River to the Malibamat�o River, and records the outflow of the catchment of the former, embracing an area of 403 square kilometres. The minimum annual discharge on record is zero, meaning that the Bokong River dries out in some years, showing that the area is relatively dry. Mean annual discharge is 1930 litres/sec, with peaks above 5000 litres when heavy rainfall brings a thaw to the accumulated snow. For the Bokong River these are the only flow data available. The upper reaches of the Malibamat�o River, not far from the study area, have several operating gauging stations, with much wider capabilities. Mean discharge in these points is higher than in the Bokong River, between 3000 and 4000 litres/sec even though the catchments are much smaller. The hydrologic conditions seem similar otherwise. One of these points, the Oxbow gauge, recorded the following values between 1969 and 1988:\n\nArea of catchment: 277 km�\n\nElevation: 2600 m\n\nAverage annual temperature: 7.5 �C\n\nPrecipitation: 1228 mm/year\n\nEvapotranspiration rate:473 mm/year\n\nHumidity index:61 %\n\nTotal discharge: 3200 litres/sec = 99 Hm3/year\n\nSpecific total discharge: 11.4 litres sec-1 km-2\n\nRainfall equivalence: 359 mm/year\n\nMean runoff: 2700 litres/sec = 85 Hm3/year\n\nBase flow: 400 litres/sec = 14 Hm3/year\n\nPercentage of base flow over total discharge: 14 %.\n\nThese data highlight the erosive potential of the precipitation, as most of the water discharges as runoff. Of course, the data do not refer specifically to the study site but the role of runoff generally cannot be underestimated.\n\nSoil and Plant Cover\n\nData on the soils of Lesotho in general, and of the study area in particular, have not yet been compiled. The published map of the Lesotho land systems by Bawden and Carroll includes some information about the main soil groups over the country. In the Bokong catchment and in the upper Malibamat�o watershed there are four or five dominant soil groups. Over half of the area is covered by lithosols or calcimorphic soils over steep, grass-covered slopes. More primitive lithosols and raw mineral soils are found on higher slopes and in the divide line on the Maluiti Range, where also many boggy sponges are found. Some vertisols are developed in the bottom of valleys, above and below the Khatse dam. These areas with vertisols are suitable for cultivation, according to the map, and farming does take place there. The remainder of the study zone is unsuitable for cultivation, and only suitable for grazing. However, most of the bottom of the Malibamat�o valley was cultivated prior to the building of the Khatse dam, and many plots of farmed land still remain on the lower slopes of this valley and the Bokong valley. The larger part of the area is used only for grazing, and sustains large stocks of cattle, sheep and some horses. Until recently, the access of herds to all the grazing lands was unrestricted, and there are many signs of overgrazing. The middle slopes show signs of man-made or cattle-made erosion (scars, \"pied de vache\" tracks, areas stripped out of grass, etc), as well as others perhaps of natural origin (solifluction lobes, etc). Now the upper slopes, which are much more fragile and can only sustain small herds, are free of livestock, although there is always some clandestine grazing.\n\nMost of the country of Lesotho lies above the timberline. In the eastern slopes of the Drakensberg, in Natal, there are remains of Podocarpus montane forest between 1300 and 1800 m. In Lesotho, the potential upper limit of forest is at 2150 m but no forest remains. Introduced trees grow on the lowlands, mainly around urban settlements and along the rivers. Native forests, if they existed, disappeared long ago. In the Highlands only some shrubs remain, especially next to the mountain ravines, and occasionally these plants form a dense cover, almost impenetrable in places. But the main cover of the highlands and the only one on the study area is grassland. Dominant species are Themeda triandra and Festuca caprina. The former species is found in the warmest places, at lower altitudes and on north-facing slopes, while the latter grows at higher elevations, together with tussocks of Merxmuelleria drakensbergensis. Above the upper limit of this montane grassland (2900 m) the afroalpine belt is found, with patches of sclerophyllous heath communities, with Erica dominans, E. glaphyra, Helychrysum trilineatum, etc.\n\nThe most interesting vegetation of Lesotho is the spongy mires of the uppermost levels of the Drakensberg and Maluti Mountains. About 55 large boggy areas are recorded on the main map of Lesotho, the largest being associated with the sources of the Orange River. The actual number of mires should be much greater, as most of the boggy areas of small size remain unrecorded. There are no large mires on the Bokong watershed, the closest being those on the watershed of the Motete River, a tributary of the Malibamat�o. The watersheds of the latter have also several large spongy areas. Small mires are found, of course, all over the top levels of the Lesotho highlands. Next to Mafika Pass (3090 m), at the head of Bokong watershed, there are several of these, and probably more will be found along the divide line of the Senqu and Mohokare watersheds, which border the Bokong catchment on the western side. Peat bogs are excellent buffers, which regulate the supply of water by retaining it and delivering it during the dry season. Moreover, the bogs form a peculiar ecosystem, rather common in the arctic and in the mountains of the northern hemisphere but quite scarce in Africa. Drakensberg bogs, being isolated for millions of years from other similar ecosystems, have developed a peculiar set of plant and animal species, which are exclusive to them. Several plant, amphibians and insect microendemics restricted to the montane bogs have been recorded, and no doubt, several species remain to be discovered there. Protection of these sensitive areas from overgrazing and mining is thus badly needed. Of special concern is the Highland Waters Project, and the possible destruction or drying of many of these bogs.\n\nBesides the peat bogs, the mountains of Lesotho have many other endemics configuring the Eastern Mountain Centre of endemisms. While most of the endemic species of this centre inhabit the eastern slopes, in Kwazulu-Natal, significant number of these are found also in Lesotho. Over 29% of the flora of this centre is made up of endemic species. Families with a high percentage of endemics are Asteraceae, with 118 species (41%), Scrophulariaceae (46%) and Ericaceae (58%).\n\nRelated Subjects\n\nSome historical background is required to understand the evolution of the soils on the mountain areas of Lesotho. The zone was formerly inhabited by hunter-gatherers cultures, such as the San. The Sotho entered the country during the last centuries and slowly drove the San away. The nineteenth century witnessed a massive influx of the Sotho, fleeing away from the Zulu and later from the Boers and the British. Wars against these forces and between the different clans of the Basotho took place throughout the century. Until 1966, the country was ruled by Britain. During these years, plough farming was extended over the mountain areas, and the erosion problems increased dramatically. The first measures against erosion were taken during the 1930s, and several programmes of soil restoration have been undertaken since then, or are still underway.\n\nOne of the striking features of Lesotho, which goes some way to explaining the intensity of the erosion processes is the lack of forest. At least five hypotheses have been proposed to explain this absence. Some authors say that the arrival of Bantu peoples, with their technology of iron smelting quickly deprived the country of all the forests. For other authors, the forests were cut and burned to keep livestock. Soil and climatic origins have been invoked also. The most probable hypothesis seems to be a combination of climatic and anthropic origins. Given that on most of the mountains the dry period coincides with the cold part of the year, the plant cover is markedly seasonal. There is high production during the summer, when there is plenty of water and high temperatures, and low production during winter. This favours the accumulation of dry biomass at the end of the winter, which is very sensitive to fires. Frequency of thunderstorms and lightning at this time is quite high, and natural fires would have been very frequent. The conditions favour the natural selection of pyrophitic species, which are able to withstand repeated fires, and it is possible that the farmers and shepherds assisted in this selection. The scarcity of trees and shrubs in the Highlands relative to the proportion outside the area agrees with this hypothesis: it is worthless to invest in a biomass capital if the stems are being burned every year.\n\nWater shortages are probably of much greater importance than temperature constraints for the growth of grassland cover in the Lesotho mountains. O�Connor & Bredenkamp show a clear linear relationship between mean rainfall and mean herbage yield. As the rainy season coincides with the summer, when temperatures are relatively high, cold conditions do not reduce the positive influence of altitude on rainfall. Of course, in the highest parts of the Bokong valley, above 3000 m, temperatures are low even in summer, and production is probably limited. But in the lower and middle parts of the valley, where the study area is located, the relationship between elevation and production probably holds. This relationship is made up of two separate relationships, viz, the increase of precipitation with altitude (an increase of 38 mm every 100 m) and the increase of production with rainfall (an increase of 100 kg/ha every 200 mm of rainfall)."
