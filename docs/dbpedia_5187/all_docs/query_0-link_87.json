        "text": "Administration of Estates & Inheritance Act 2024 comes as a long-awaited review of the law relating to inheritance, administration, and distribution of estates of persons who are deceased, minors, persons under curatorship, mentally incapacitated persons, certified ill and incapable of managing their own affairs including persons absent from Lesotho without a lawful representative in Lesotho whose whereabouts are unknown. Further, it regulates the wills and rights of beneficiaries, and it provides for incidental matters.\n\nWills\n\nThe Act details the content and form of wills. This narration can act as a guide to testators as to what to include in their will. It provides that a will shall –\n\nbe legibly handwritten or typed and signed;\n\nby a testator\n\nat the foot of each leaf of the will\n\nin the presence of two competent witnesses who are over the age of 18 and who shall append their signatures before or in the presence of the testator and each other:\n\nbe dated\n\nhave a revocation clause\n\ngive full names, nationality, identity number, addresses and marital status of the testator; and\n\ngive full names and identity number of witnesses\n\nThe Act also discusses the issue of competence to make a will. It establishes that any person aged 18 years and above who owns the property and is mentally capable of understanding the nature and effect of his act may make a will. In essence, the Act bestows on every person the right to draft a will or written instructions.\n\nIt further extends competence to either married or unmarried couples to make a mutual will. This will prove useful in today’s society as more and more people are moving from the concept of marriage and are displaying a preference for ‘stay–togethers’ or ‘cohabitation’ as opposed to marriage.\n\nAbolition of customary law heir\n\nThe greatest highlight of the Act is that it abolishes the concept of a customary law heir. The Act declares that:\n\n‘The customary law on inheritance and allocation of property to an heir shall not be applicable to an estate of the deceased person.’\n\nRather, all children of the deceased person under civil or customary marriage, both male and female, regardless of age, shall be beneficiaries in equal shares of the estate of their deceased parents unless there is a will or written instructions to the contrary.\n\nMoreover, the Act avers that siblings shall have co-ownership of land in matters relating to the inheritance of land and that inherited arable land shall not be subjected to subdivision.\n\nThe Act further provides that in a polygamous marriage, all the children in each house, male or female, regardless of age, shall inherit in equal shares, where there are no will or written instructions. This concept further eradicates the customary law practice that allotted inheritance for first-born sons only. Under the new Act, even female children are eligible to inherit.\n\nProtection of vulnerable persons\n\nTo protect the inheritance of vulnerable persons, a child whose deceased parent’s estate is inherited by paternal uncles on intestacy under customary law even before the commencement of the Act is be entitled to the property of its parents on the coming into operation of this Act. Furthermore, upon the death of the paternal uncle, the child is eligible to inherit from the property of the paternal uncle to the extent of the child’s share.\n\nThe Act truly protects the interests of orphaned children. It will also curb the injustices that prevailed under the customary law reign, which allowed paternal uncles to inherit without enforcing accountability to the deceased’s children, leaving the orphaned children destitute.\n\nPosition on Spouses\n\nThe Act upholds the position of the spouse as it was under the previous amended Act. It allows a spouse to inherit a child’s share of the intestate estate, where the deceased spouse leaves a descendant who is entitled to succeed. However, if the deceased spouse leaves no descendants, the surviving spouse shall be the sole heir.\n\nControversy on illegitimate children\n\nThe National Assembly aimed to introduce the inheritance of children born out of wedlock from their biological fathers where there is evidence of maintenance from such a father. It further suggested that a child born out of wedlock shall inherit a child’s share from its mother, irrespective of its mother’s marital status.\n\nThese clauses were rejected by MPs and the majority of principal chiefs, who argued that they wanted to protect the ‘sanctity’ of children born in formal marriages. This then led to controversy between the aforementioned parties and human rights activists who reasonably advocated for the need to protect illegitimate children from continued discrimination under inheritance law.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the Administration of Estates and Inheritance Act, 2024 includes updates on provisions pertaining to;\n\nAbolishment of customary law heir\n\nThe introduction of the inheritance of a female child and that of siblings regardless of age or gender on an equal basis, allowing all siblings to inherit equally.\n\nIntroduction of inheritance under customary law for polygamous and non-polygamous marriage or union\n\nThe conferment of the right or freedom to write a will or written instructions to every person.\n\nLastly, the introduction of inheritance of vulnerable people\n\nReferences\n\nAdministration of Estates & Inheritance Act 2024\n\nCommittee on Law and Public Safety Cluster (2024) Report on the Administration of Estates and Inheritance Bill, 2024 Lesotho National Assembly\n\nhttps://nationalassembly.parliament.ls/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Report-on-the-Administration-of-Estates-and-Inheritance-Bill-2024-.pdf\n\nMathatisi Sebusi, (2024, April 4th) ‘Uproar over Inheritance Act.’ Lesotho Times"
