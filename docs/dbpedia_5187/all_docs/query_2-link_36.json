        "text": "The southeast tip of Africa is an amazing place for multiethnic cultures and geographical peculiarities. Lesotho is one of only three countries surrounded by another, in this case South Africa. Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is one of only seven countries surrounded by two countries (Mozambique and South Africa). Durban has over one million ethnic-Indians, making it one of the largest concentrations outside of India for a city. Clarens is an artist haven named after a village in Switzerland.\n\nThe region is full of alluring geological features. Lesotho’s lowest elevation is the highest for any country. Diminutive Eswatini has all the landscape features of Africa except desert and sea. Durban’s Golden Mile is a long stretch of wide beaches with soft sand on the Indian Ocean. Clarens is in the foothills of the Maluti Mountains in the Free State province of South Africa.\n\nThis post is the second part of our South African road trip starting from Johannesburg in July 2022. See South African Road Trip – Part 1: Johannesburg, Soweto, Kruger and Maputo for more information, some pertaining to the destinations in this post.\n\nThe native languages of Eswatini include Swazi and English and we had little trouble communicating in the latter.\n\nThe official languages of Lesotho are Sesotho and English, but we found many did not know the latter.\n\nWe had no problem in South Africa speaking only English.\n\nWe had no issues with safety except for potentially having a car breakdown in an undesirable spot, as there are scattered bad roads, particularly in Lesotho.\n\nAs with all big South African cities, there are constant warnings by Durban locals to be careful and avoid walking on your own. It’s difficult to know if all the fuss is warranted or somewhat overblown. Clarens is very safe, and I walked with my camera everywhere.\n\nAbout 30 km / 18 miles from the Goba crossing at the Eswatini border, our cheap Toyota Starlet had some of the plastic undercarriage come off, and then the passenger-side, front-tire ripped. This was a rural area without a lot of traffic. It was surprising this happened as we stuck to national highways and did not go on 4WD roads.\n\nThe jack was worthless, the worst I’d seen in my life. We flagged down an open-bed cargo truck and these three gents jumped out to help. Luckily, they could use their jack under the axle to raise our car. Eventually, they replaced the tire with an undersized, yellow-rimmed spare.\n\nWe went to the Toyota dealer to clip back the undercarriage and to a tire dealer to replace the front two tires (so that they matched). While we spent most of the day repairing the car and buying a SIM card, it was interesting as we were able to observe how local businesses function. Hertz, the rental company, offered absolutely no help and didn’t reimburse us for the new tires.\n\nFor each of the two nights in Mbabane, we had excellent dinners. Ramblas Restaurant claims to be the best in the city, and it well might be, serving local, Catalan and international dishes. The Velvet Monkey is an excellent Italian restaurant then managed by a young man from southern Italy. Here we had dinner with George, a United Nations colleague of Khadija and fellow Kenyan, and his wife. He was the UN Resident Coordinator for Eswatini and was able to describe the interworking of the government and the economy. The next day we met him at his office.\n\nWe discussed the 2021 riots in the KwaZulu-Natal (where Durban is) and Guateng (where Johannesburg and Pretoria are) provinces, ignited by the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma and aggravated by long-simmering tensions over economic disparities. There was more than US$1 billion of damages with looting of shopping malls, private residences and other types of property including a chemical plant by John’s home, which had the inventory spilled into waterways. According to John and others, the police hardly did anything to stop the violence.\n\nJohn said if this happens again, the businesses and homeowners will be armed. He said he had nine guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and his neighbor made bullets if he needed more. Of course, the result would be a bloodbath.\n\nDurban and South Africa in general have been experiencing a deterioration of public service, especially electricity blackouts on a daily basis. The country appears to be at a crossroads and hopefully, it can manage its deep-seated issues and progress economically and socially.\n\nIndividuals who do this type of important volunteer work deserve praise and recognition. However, they probably receive little and do it because they want to make a difference. We are looking forward to seeing Gary who will be visiting us sometime in New York.\n\nJust after we left the park, we stopped to speak with this shepherd with three skinny dogs. However, we didn’t know any words in common. Through body gestures, we wished him a good day and gave him cashews which he appeared to have appreciated.\n\nOn this trip, a few people recommended going to Clarens, an hour’s drive from the border in Lesotho and a four-hour drive to Johannesburg. It was established in 1912 and named after the town of Clarens in Switzerland where exiled, controversial, Boer politician Paul Kruger spent his last days.\n\nWe are glad we took their advice, as the small town is bursting with art galleries and boutique shops.\n\nWe got a good impression and understanding of Eswatini and Lesotho, our two main destinations for this part of the road trip. However, we only saw parts of these countries and missed major attractions.\n\nOne thing, in particular, I really want to do is the donkey pub crawl offered by Semonkong Lodge. Using this venerable pack animal, you can visit traditional beer-brewing homes, and local bars and enjoy local Basotho folk music and dancing.\n\nThis is just another of the many reasons Khadija and I have to go back!"
