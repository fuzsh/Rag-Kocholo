        "text": "Maseru (pronounced \"mɑseʀu\") is the capital of Lesotho. Located on the Mohokare River, bordering South Africa, it is Lesotho's only sizable city, with a population of approximately 180,000 (2004). It is the capital or camptown of the Maseru District. Up until 2004 Maseru had a growing textile industry supported by and invested in by Chinese manufactures. Since the expiration of US tariffs to China the textile industry in Lesotho has tapered off. The city's manufactures once included candles and carpets but have been overshadowed by South African industry."
