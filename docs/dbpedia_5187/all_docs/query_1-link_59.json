Movable Christian holidays include Good Friday, Easter Monday, and Ascension.\n\nTIME: 2 pm = noon GMT.\n\nLOCATION, SIZE, AND EXTENT\n\nLesotho is an enclave within the Republic of South Africa, with an area of 30,355 sq km (11,720 sq mi), extending 248 km (154 mi) nne–ssw and 181 km (112 mi) ese–wnw. Comparatively, the area occupied by Lesotho is slightly smaller than the state of Maryland.\n\nIt is bordered on the e by the South African province of Natal, on the s by Cape Province, and on the w and n by the Orange Free State, with a total boundary length of 909 km (565 mi). Lesotho claims that Basotho lands now part of South Africa were unjustly taken by force in the 19th century.\n\nLesotho's capital city, Maseru, is located on the country's northwest border.\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThree distinct geographical regions, demarcated by ascending altitude, extend approximately north-south across Lesotho. The western quarter of the country is a plateau averaging 1,500–1,850 m (4,900–6,100 ft). The soil of this zone is derived from sandstone and, particularly in the westernmost region, is poor and badly eroded. The remainder of the country is highland. A zone of rolling foothills, ranging from 1,800–2,200 m (5,900–7,200 ft), forms the border between the lowlands and the mountains in the east.\n\nThe Drakensberg Range forms the entire eastern and southeastern border. A spur of this range, the Maluti Mountains, runs north and south. Where it joins the Drakensberg Range there is a high plateau ranging from 2,700–3,200 m (8,900–10,500 ft) in elevation. The highest point is Thabana Ntlenyana, 3,482 m (11,425 ft), in the east. The rich volcanic soils of the foothills and mountains are some of the best in the country.\n\nThe sources of two of the principal rivers of South Africa, the Orange and the Tugela, are in these mountains. Tributaries of the Caledon River, which forms the country's western border, also rise here. The Orange and Caledon rivers, together with their tributaries, drain more than 90% of the country.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nTemperatures vary widely from one geographical zone to another, and frequently within zones, depending on the altitude. In the lowlands, temperatures reach 32°c (90°f) or more in the summer and rarely fall below -7°c (19°f) in the winter. The range in the highlands is greater; temperatures sometimes fall below -18°c (0°f), and frost and hail are frequent hazards. Rainfall, which is mostly concentrated in the months from October to April, averages 71 cm (28 in) annually, varying from 191 cm (75 in) in parts of the mountains to as little as 60 cm (24 in) in the lowlands. Most of the rainwater is lost through runoff, and droughts are common.\n\nFLORA AND FAUNA\n\nGrass is the natural vegetation in this virtually treeless country. The high plateau is covered with montane or subalpine grassland. Red oat grass forms a dry carpet in much of the Drakensberg foothill region. The country's small size, high elevation, and limited range of habitats restrict the variety of fauna. The African lammergeier, a bird common in the mountains of Ethiopia but nowhere else in Africa, and the bald ibis, both of which are near extinction, are found in small numbers in the Drakensberg Range. As of 2002, there were at least 33 species of mammals, 123 species of birds, and over 1,500 species of plants throughout the country.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nMuch of the country has become denuded of its natural grass cover through uncontrolled grazing and rushing surface water. Related problems are severe soil erosion, soil exhaustion, and desertification. In response to these problems, the Highlands Water Project has the goals of controlling, storing, and redirecting water to South Africa. More than 3.5 million trees, mostly eucalyptus, have been planted as part of a gully control program, and for production of fuel and poles. Among the agencies with environmental responsibility is the National Environmental Secretariat of the prime minister's office.\n\nUnlike neighboring South Africa, Lesotho is not rich in game and other wildlife. The famous Basuto pony, of almost pure Arabian stock, reached its peak of quality and quantity around the turn of the century. After suffering a decline because of ruinous trading practices, overstocking, overgrazing, disease, and drought, the pony has begun to make a comeback through a selective breeding program and improved feeding methods. Other vanishing species, like the wildebeest and blesbok, have been reintroduced in areas where they formerly were numerous. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the number of threatened species included 3 types of mammals, 7 species of birds, 1 species of fish, 1 species of invertebrate, and 1 species of plant. Threatened species included the blue crane, the brown hyena, the African lion and the lesser flamingo.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe population of Lesotho in 2005 was estimated by the United Nations (UN) at 1,804,000, which placed it at number 142 in population among the 193 nations of the world. In 2005, approximately 5% of the population was over 65 years of age, with another 38% of the population under 15 years of age. There were 87 males for every 100 females in the country. According to the UN, the annual population rate of change for 2005–2010 was expected to be -0.1%. The projected population for the year 2025 was 1,604,000. The population density was 59 per sq km (154 per sq mi). Some 70% of the total population lives in the fertile lowlands, where the land can be most readily cultivated; the rest is scattered in the foothills and the mountains.\n\nThe UN estimated that 13% of the population lived in urban areas in 2005, and that urban areas were growing at an annual rate of 0.75%. The capital city, Maseru, had a population of 170,000 in that year. Other large towns are Leribe, Berea, and Mafeteng.\n\nThe prevalence of HIV/AIDS has had a significant impact on the population of Lesotho. The UN estimated that 30.1% of adults between the ages of 15–49 were living with HIV/AIDS in 2001. The AIDS epidemic causes higher death and infant mortality rates, and lowers life expectancy.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nIn 1996, around 60% of active male wage earners in Lesotho worked in South Africa. Lesotho reported that 25,000 miners were sent to South African gold mines in the first six months of 2001. There were 6,000 migrants living in Lesotho in 2000, and virtually no refugees. According to Migration Information Source, Lesotho led the world's nations with the highest total remittances received as a percentage of GDP in 2001, with remittances as 26.2% of GDP, equivalent to $112.80 per capita. In 2003 remittances were $2.17 million. In 2004, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported no refugees or asylum seekers. In 2005, the net migration rate was an estimated -0.74 per 1,000 population. The government views the migration levels as satisfactory.\n\nETHNIC GROUPS\n\nLesotho is ethnically homogeneous. At least 99.7% of the people are Sotho. Europeans, Asians, and other groups make up the remaining population.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe Sesotho (southern Sotho) language is spoken by virtually all the indigenous population. English shares with Sesotho the position of official language. Zulu and Xhosa are also spoken.\n\nRELIGIONS\n\nChristian missions have long been active in Lesotho. As a result, about 90% of the population are Christian, with about 70% being Roman Catholic. The primary Protestant denominations are the Lesotho Evangelical Church and the Anglican Church. Muslims, members of other non-Christian religions, and atheists make up the remaining 10%. The indigenous population, including many of its Christian members, follow African traditional religions. Some of the Catholic churches in the country incorporate traditional customs into worship, including traditional music, language, and dress. Christians are found throughout the country, while Muslims tend to be concentrated in the northeastern part of the country. Many of the Muslims are of Asian descent, while most of the Christians are indigenous Basotho. Certain Christian holidays are celebrated as national holidays.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nIn 2002 there were 4,995 km (3,104 mi) of roadway in Lesotho, 887 km (551 mi) of which were paved. A 2.6-km (1.6-mi) South African railway connects Maseru's industrial park to the Bloemfontein-Natal line, providing a valuable freight link to South Africa.\n\nIn 2004, there were an estimated 28 airports, of which only 3 had paved runways as of 2005. Lesotho Airways and South African Airways maintain scheduled passenger service between Johannesburg and Moshoeshoe International, the new international airport 19 km (12 mi) outside of Maseru. Lesotho Airways also has regular service to Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, and to 28 domestic airstrips. In 1997 (the latest year for which data was available), about 29,000 passengers were carried on scheduled domestic and international airline flights. Air taxis and chartered planes serve airstrips at Maseru and other centers.\n\nHISTORY\n\nWhat is now Lesotho was inhabited by hunter-gatherers, called the San Bushmen by the whites, until about 1600, when refugees from Bantu tribal wars began arriving. In 1818, Moshoeshoe, a minor chief of a northern tribe in what was to become Basutoland, brought together the survivors of the devastating Zulu and Matabele raids and founded the Basotho nation. During the early days of its existence, the Basotho also had to contend with incursions by Boers from the Orange Free State. Moshoeshoe sought UK protection, but not before much land had been lost to white settlers. His urgent appeals for assistance went unheeded until 1868, when Basutoland became a crown protectorate. Moshoeshoe died in 1870. The following year, Basutoland was annexed to the Cape Colony, over the protests of both Basotho and Boer leaders. In 1880, the so-called Gun War broke out between the Basotho and the Boers over the attempt to disarm the Basotho in accordance with the provisions of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878. A high point in Basotho history was the successful resistance waged against the Cape's forces.\n\nIn 1884, Basutoland was returned to UK administration under a policy of indirect rule. Local government was introduced in 1910 with the creation of the Basutoland Council, an advisory body composed of the British resident commissioner, the paramount chief, and 99 appointed Basotho members. In effect, for the next 50 years the chiefs were allowed to govern. Under a new constitution that became effective in 1960, an indirectly elected legislative body, the Basutoland National Council, was created.\n\nA constitutional conference held in London in 1964 approved the recommendations for a pre-independence constitution that had been made by a constitutional commission. The new constitution went into effect on 30 April 1965, following the general election. The resident commissioner became the British government representative, retaining powers for defense, external affairs, internal security, and the public service.\n\nIn April 1966, a conflict arose in parliament between the government and the opposition over Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan's motion requesting that Britain set a date for independence. To forestall passage of the motion, Paramount Chief Moshoeshoe II replaced 5 of his 11 senatorial appointees with 5 opponents of the government. The High Court subsequently invalidated that action, declaring that his right to appoint 11 senators did not entail the right of dismissal. The Senate and National Assembly eventually passed the independence motion, the latter by a vote of 32 to 28, but the dispute foreshadowed a constitutional crisis that was not conclusively resolved at independence. The final independence conference was held in June 1966. Charging that the United Kingdom was granting independence to a minority government, and demanding a more significant role for the paramount chief, delegates representing the opposition withdrew. Moshoeshoe II himself declined to sign the final accord.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe United Kingdom granted independence to the newly named Kingdom of Lesotho on 4 October 1966; Moshoeshoe II was proclaimed king on that date. The first general election following the attainment of independence was held in January 1970. When it appeared that the ruling party, the Basotho National Party (BNP), would be defeated, Prime Minister Jonathan, its leader, declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution. The Basotho Congress Party (BCP), led by Ntsu Mokhehle, claimed that it had won 33 seats to the BNP's 23. Leabua Jonathan admitted he had lost the election but nevertheless arrested the opposition leaders. The unrest, he said, was due to Communist influence, and since the majority of the people were behind him he would suspend the constitution and hold new elections later. King Moshoeshoe II was placed under house arrest and in April 1970 the Netherlands gave him asylum. He was permitted to return in December.\n\nScattered attacks on police posts occurred in January 1974 in an alleged attempt by supporters of the BCP to overthrow the government of the ruling BNP. The abortive coup d'etat resulted in the arrest, killing, imprisonment, or exile of many people. In March 1975, 15 BCP followers were found guilty of high treason. The struggle against the Jonathan government continued through the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), the military arm of the BCP in exile, claiming responsibility for periodic bombings in Maseru, ambushes of government officials, and attacks on police stations. The Lesotho government charged that South Africa was allowing the LLA to use its territory as a base of operations.\n\nRelations with South Africa deteriorated after that nation granted independence in 1976 to the Bantu homeland of Transkei, on Lesotho's southeastern border. When Lesotho (like all other nations except South Africa) declined to recognize Transkei, the Transkeian authorities closed the border with Lesotho, which also angered South Africa by harboring members of the banned African National Congress (ANC), an exiled South African insurgent group. On 9 December 1982, South African troops raided private residences of alleged ANC members in Maseru; 42 persons were killed, including at least 12 Basotho citizens. In the early 1980s, South Africa used economic pressures against Lesotho.\n\nParliamentary elections scheduled for August 1985 by the Jonathan government were called off because all five opposition parties refused to take part, charging that the voters' roll was fraudulent. Later that year, South Africa stepped up its destabilization activities, conducting a commando raid and aiding antigovernment elements. On 1 January 1986, South Africa imposed a neartotal blockade of Lesotho that resulted in severe shortages of food and essential supplies. On 20 January, a military coup led by Maj. Gen. Justin Metsing Lekhanya overthrew the government. All executive and legislative powers were vested in the king, acting on the advice of a six-man military council. On 25 January, a number of ANC members and sympathizers were flown from Lesotho to Zambia, whereupon South Africa ended its blockade of the country. All political activity was banned on 27 March.\n\nThere was widespread skepticism about the military government and its links to Pretoria, and agitation to return to civilian rule. In 1990, Lekhanya had Moshoeshoe II exiled (for a second time) after the king refused to agree to the dismissal of several senior officers. In November 1990, a new law was announced providing for a constitutional monarchy but barring Moshoeshoe from the throne. Later that month, Moshoeshoe's son (King Letsie III), was elected king by an assembly of chiefs.\n\nIn April 1991, rebel army officers staged a bloodless coup, forcing Lekhanya to resign. He was succeeded by Col. Elias Ramaema as leader of a military junta. In July 1992, the king was allowed to return to a hero's welcome.\n\nMultiparty elections were scheduled for 28 November 1992, but they were postponed until 1993 because of delays in delimiting parliamentary constituencies. Finally, on 27 March 1993, in the first democratic elections in 23 years, the Basotho Congress Party, the major opposition party, won all 65 seats in the Assembly. The BCP formed a government under Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle. The BCP offered to nominate four BNP members but only one opposition politician accepted. Several cabinet members were appointed from opposition ranks.\n\nOn 25 January 1994, army troops mutinied in Maseru after the government refused their demands for a 100% pay increase. Prime Minister Mokhehle requested military assistance from South Africa, but that request was denied. After three weeks of sporadic fighting, the two factions within the military agreed to a Commonwealth-brokered deal for negotiations with the government.\n\nIn August 1994, Lesotho's first democratically elected government faced another challenge when King Letsie III suspended parliament and imposed a \"Ruling Council.\" The king had been angered by the Mokhehle government's creation of a board of inquiry to investigate the dethroning of his father. Although Letsie had the support of the security forces, his royal coup was condemned internally and internationally, and the United States cut off aid. On 14 September the crisis was resolved when the king agreed to return the throne to his father. However, two years later King Moshoeshoe was killed in a car crash, and his son reclaimed the throne—much to the consternation of pro-democracy groups and Lesotho's neighbors.\n\nAlthough the government increased military salaries in line with other government workers in 1995, an uprising three years later by a disgruntled faction of the Lesotho Defense Forces necessitated Botswana and South Africa military intervention. Over 50 soldiers were taken into custody and charged with mutiny in September 1998 on the heels of rioting and looting that destroyed parts of the capital following the May elections in 1998. The violence cost Lesotho untold millions as it sent the economy into a tailspin.\n\nThe Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) won the majority in parliament in the 23 May 1998 general elections, leaving the once-dominant Basotho National Party (BNP) and Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) far behind in total votes. Although international observers as well as a regional commission declared the elections to have reflected the will of the people, many members of the opposition have accused the LCD of electoral fraud. The 1998 elections were the third multiparty elections in Lesotho's history. Nevertheless, after political riots following the disputed 1998, an all party forum called the Interim Political Authority was formed to level ground for the next poll. It proposed the restructuring of the Independent Electoral Commission, which happened, and the change of the model from winner takes all to mixed member proportional representation. In the 25 May 2002 general elections, the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy was reelected by majority, winning all but one of the 80 constituency based seats. Under the proportional representation system 40 compensatory seats were shared among nine opposition parties. In terms of popular vote in the 2002 elections, LCD won 54%, BNP 21%, LPC 7%, and other parties 18%.\n\nAs of 2005, the Lesotho government remained a modified form of constitutional monarchy. The prime minister, Pakalitha Mosisili, was head of government and had executive authority. The king serves a largely ceremonial function; he no longer possesses any executive authority and is proscribed from actively participating in political initiatives.\n\nLesotho remained among the poorest countries in Africa with the majority of the population living below the poverty line on less than $1 a day. In June 2005, Lesotho had an HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of 28% among the adult population, and unemployment stood at 51%. Poverty, lack of jobs, and food shortages in the sub-region were driving rural to urban migration, and increasing the likelihood that young women and women heads of household would engage in commercial and risky sex to provide for their families.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nAccording to the 1993 constitution, the Kingdom of Lesotho is a monarchy with a bicameral parliament consisting of a National Assembly of 120 members—80 elected by direct popular vote and 40 by proportional vote—for five-year terms, and a Senate consisting of 33 members—22 chiefs and 11 others appointed by the ruling party.\n\nUntil 1993 the king was official chief of state (motlotlehi ), and was designated by the College of Chiefs, according to Basotho custom. The prime minister (head of government) was appointed by the king and was a member of the majority party in the National Assembly. The cabinet was also appointed by the king, in accordance with advice of the prime minister, from among members of both houses of parliament.\n\nUnder the 1993 constitution the monarch has become a figurehead, a \"living symbol of national unity\" with no executive or legislative powers. He is selected by traditional law and the College of Chiefs, which holds the power to determine who is next in the line of succession, and who shall serve as regent in the event that the successor is a minor. The College also may depose the monarch.\n\nThe leader of the majority party in the Assembly automatically becomes prime minister. Since 1998, the prime minister has been Pakalitha Mosisili, the leader of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD).\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThe Basotho National Party (BNP), formerly the Basutoland National Party, was founded in 1959 and was in the forefront of Lesotho's independence drive. The BNP long stood for maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and for a cautious approach to cooperation with other African states, in an attitude of \"choose our friends but live with our neighbors.\" However, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the BNP played a more active role in opposing apartheid. By 1998, BNP had become the leading opposition party, as the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) took power.\n\nThe Basotho Congress Party (BCP), founded in 1952 and formerly known as the Basutoland African Congress, is an outspoken Pan-Africanist party. The first party to demand independence, it subsequently opposed the \"premature\" granting of independence to a minority government. The third major party is the Marematlou Freedom Party (MFP). This party was formed in 1965 by the merger of two parties that had supported the chieftaincy.\n\nIn the general election held on 29 April 1965, the BNP won 31 seats, the BCP 25 seats, and the MFP 4 seats in the National Assembly. Chief Jonathan was himself defeated in the election, and Sekhonyana Maseribane was appointed prime minister. Chief Jonathan won a by-election on 1 June and assumed the office of prime minister. The two opposition parties, which together had polled 56.2% of the vote to 41.6% for the BNP (with 2.2% of the vote going to others), in an election in which only 62% of those eligible had voted, joined forces to protest Britain's granting of independence to a minority government. They also called for a more even distribution of executive power between the prime minister and the chief of state, and appealed to the UN, the Commonwealth, and the OAU in an unsuccessful bid to have the independence agreement rescinded.\n\nThe BCP claimed it had won 33 seats in the 60-seat National Assembly in the January 1970 general elections; the BNP won 23 seats, and the ballots for 4 seats had not been counted. Confusion over the outcome of the 1970 election (in which the United Democratic Party and the Communist Party participated but won no seats) resulted in suspension of the constitution by Prime Minister Jonathan, and political activities of opposition parties were subsequently restricted. Prime Minister Jonathan appointed two members of opposition parties to his cabinet in November 1975. The BCP then split into two factions: members of one accepted government posts, while leaders of the other organized an armed insurgency in exile.\n\nThe March 1993 election was contested by more than a dozen parties, but the chief vote getters were the BCP, still headed by Dr. Mokhehle, and the BNP, led by Evaristus Sekhonyana. Among the others are the MFP, the United Democratic Party (UDP), and the Communist Party of Lesotho (CPL). The BCP held all elected seats in the National Assembly, despite having won just over half the vote.\n\nSince 1998, the dominant political party has been the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) under the leadership of Dr. Pakalitha Mosisili. LCD won just over 60% of the votes in the May 1998 parliamentary elections. The major opposition parties included: the Basotho National Party (BNP); the Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) led by Molapo Qhobela (24% of the 1998 vote); the Lesotho Labor Party/United Democratic Party Alliance (LLP/UDP) led by Charles Mofeli and Mamolefi Ranthimo; the Marematlou Freedom Party (MFP); the National Progressive Party (NPP); and the Sefate Democratic Union (SDU).\n\nIn the 25 May 2002 parliamentary election, the LCD garnered 54% of the vote, the BNP 21%, the Lesotho People's Congress or LPC 7%, and other parties took 18%. With the number of seats expanded from 80 to 120, the breakdown by party was: LCD 76, BNP 21, LPC 5, and other parties 18. Although opposition parties objected to the results, independent observers described the elections as free, fair, peaceful, lawful, and transparent—a model for Southern Africa. Next elections were due in 2007.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nThere are 10 districts, each headed by a centrally appointed district administrator. District councils, established in 1944, were abolished in 1966. Each district is subdivided into wards, most of them presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the royal family. During the period of military rule, each district was headed by a district secretary and a district military officer appointed by the central government and the defense force, respectively.\n\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe legal system is based on English common law and RomanDutch law with judicial review of legislative acts in High Court and Court of Appeal. Lesotho has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.\n\nThe judicial system consists of the High Court, the Court of Appeal, subordinate courts, and the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). The members of the High Court are the chief justice, who is appointed by the chief of state, acting on the advice of the prime minister, and an unspecified number of puisne judges appointed by the chief of state, acting on the advice of the JSC. The Court of Appeal, which meets semiannually, is headed by a president, appointed by the chief of state, acting on the advice of the prime minister, and includes an unspecified number of justices of appeal, appointed by the chief of state, acting on the advice of the JSC. Parliament has the power of establishing subordinate courts and courts-martial. The High Court has unlimited original jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters, as well as appellate jurisdiction from subordinate courts.\n\nSubordinate courts, comprising resident magistrate's courts, judicial commissioner's courts, and central and local courts, administer statute laws, while chiefs administer customary and tribal laws. There is no trial by jury. Military courts have jurisdiction only over military cases and their decisions are final.\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nAs of 2005, Lesotho's armed forces totaled an estimated 2,000 active personnel, all of which were members of the Army. The service also had a 110-member air wing. Equipment included 22 reconnaissance vehicles and 12 artillery pieces. The air wing operated 1 patrol aircraft, 3 transport aircraft, and 4 utility helicopters. The defense budget in 2005 was $32.3 million.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nLesotho became a member of the United Nations on 17 October 1966 and participates in ECA and several nonregional specialized agencies, such as the FAO, IFC, ULP, IMF, the World Bank, UNESCO, UNHCR, and the WHO. Lesotho is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the ACP Group, the African Development Bank, the African Union, and G-77. The country's close relationship with Southern Africa is a major factor in its economic survival. Lesotho belongs to the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Lesotho is also part of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) that includes Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa.\n\nThe country is part of the Nonaligned Movement. In environmental cooperation, Lesotho is part of the Basel Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Kyoto Protocol, the Montréal Protocol, and the UN Conventions on Climate Change and Desertification.\n\nECONOMY\n\nLesotho is an agricultural country, with modest industrial, tourism, and labor-remittance incomes. Its economic policy is closely tied to that of South Africa and the South African Rand is accepted as legal tender. Remittances from miners employed in South Africa plunged by half between 1990 and 1996. As 35% of male wage earners are employed in South Africa, 54% of households in Lesotho are headed by women. There is an illicit but thriving trade in marijuana grown in Lesotho for sale in South Africa. Land is controlled by the Chiefs of the Kingdom and cannot be privately owned. Textile/garment and agro-industrial enterprises dominate the industrial sector and tend to be state-owned, although privatization has increased. Manufacturing and construction businesses, however, are mostly privately owned.\n\nFuture economic growth is tied to the massive Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) completed in 1998. The project captures, stores, and transfers the headwaters of the Orange River system to industry clustered around Johannesburg, South Africa. Ancillary dams provide electricity.\n\nCivil unrest in 1998 destroyed 80% of the commercial infrastructure in Maseru and two other towns. GDP was down by 3.6% in 1998, but was up to 3.2% in 2001, 3.8% in 2002, 3.3% in 2003, 3.0% in 2004, and down to 0.8% in 2005. Lesotho has a large trade deficit, and is a recipient of aid from the World Bank and Western countries. In 2001, the IMF approved a $32-million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program for Lesotho.\n\nINCOME\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports that in 2005 Lesotho's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $6.1 billion. The CIA defines GDP as the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and computed on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than value as measured on the basis of the rate of exchange based on current dollars. The per capita GDP was estimated at $3,300. The annual growth rate of GDP was estimated at 2%. The average inflation rate in 2005 was 4.7%. It was estimated that agriculture accounted for 15.4% of GDP, industry 44.2%, and services 40.4%.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2003 remittances from citizens working abroad totaled $184 million or about $103 per capita and accounted for approximately 17.1% of GDP. Foreign aid receipts amounted to $79 million or about $44 per capita and accounted for approximately 5.7% of the gross national income (GNI).\n\nThe World Bank reports that in 2003 household consumption in Lesotho totaled $1.09 billion or about $606 per capita based on a GDP of $1.1 billion, measured in current dollars rather than PPP. Household consumption includes expenditures of individuals, households, and nongovernmental organizations on goods and services, excluding purchases of dwellings. It was estimated that for the period 1990 to 2003 household consumption grew at an average annual rate of -0.8%. It was estimated that in 1999 about 49% of the population had incomes below the poverty line.\n\nLABOR\n\nThe economically active population was estimated at 700,000 in 2002. Approximately 86% of the resident population engages in subsistence farming, and as many as 35% of male wage-earners work in South Africa. In 2002, the unemployment rate was put at 45%.\n\nWith the exception of civil servants, workers have the right to unionize, but only about 10% of the workforce are union members. While strikes are technically legal, no legally sanctioned strikes have occurred since independence in 1966. The rights to bargain collectively and organize, while technically legal, are often restricted by the government. There are three small trade union federations: the Lesotho Trade Union Congress, the Lesotho Federation of Democratic Unions, and the Congress of Lesotho Trade Unions; these three organizations seldom cooperate with each other.\n\nWhile there are restrictions on working hours and practices for children under 14, in practice enforcement of these restrictions is ineffectual. The minimum wage is set by the government and varies from sector to sector. The minimum wage for unskilled labor was $73 per month in 2002. The law requires a maximum 45-hour workweek with 12 days of paid leave and paid holidays. Minimum occupational safety standards exist but are not effectively enforced.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nIn 2003, 17% of GDP came from agriculture. Crop production in Lesotho is a high-risk, low-yield activity due to poor soil quality and a harsh climate. All land is held in trust for the Basotho nation by the king and may not be alienated. The local chiefs allocate farmland to individuals, and user rights are generally available to married males; nevertheless, one out of seven households is landless. A 1979 act increases security of tenure by recording rights of inheritance and allowing mortgaging and subletting of land. The average landholding per family head is 1.9 hectares (4.7 acres).\n\nOnly 11% of Lesotho's land area is arable, but less than 1% has high potential. Most cultivated land is in the western lowlands. The principal food crop is corn. Main agricultural production in 2004 included (in tons) corn, 150,000; sorghum, 46,000; wheat, 51,000; dry beans, 8,000; and vegetables and melons, 18,000. The country suffered from recurrent drought conditions in the 1980s and early 1990s. Lesotho is a large importer of grains and other foodstuffs.\n\nLesotho has one of the most advanced soil conservation programs in Africa. Terracing, grass stripping, and the construction of dams and irrigation canals are widely employed to cope with the severe erosion problems.\n\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nThe raising of livestock is the principal economic undertaking in Lesotho. Grazing rights on all noncultivated land are communal, and no limits are placed on the number of livestock permitted to graze an area. Lesotho's main exports are wool and mohair; in general, however, the quality of the livestock is poor and yields are low. In 2005 there were an estimated 850,000 sheep, 650,000 goats, 540,000 head of cattle, 154,000 asses, 100,000 horses, 65,000 hogs, and 1,800,000 chickens.\n\nA number of livestock improvement centers have been established, and Merino rams and Angora bucks have been imported from South Africa for breeding purposes. Cattle, sheep, and goats are exported on the hoof. Hides and skins, usually from animals that have died of starvation or disease or have been slaughtered for human consumption, are also exported.\n\nFISHING\n\nFishing has not yet been popularized, although the Malutsenyane River is one of the best natural trout-fishing grounds in Africa. There is virtually no commercial fishing. In 2003, the total catch was 32 tons, including 16 tons of carp.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nLesotho is almost devoid of natural woodland. Trees have been planted in conjunction with soil conservation programs. Roundwood production in 2004 was estimated at 2.046 million cu m, all nonconiferous logs for fuel.\n\nMINING\n\nLesotho has long been known as a source of diamonds, mostly from alluvial deposits, and was seeing a revival of its diamond mining industry. Geological surveys have revealed a limited variety of other exploitable mineral resources. In 2004, diamond production was estimated at 4,000 carats, up from 2,099 carats in 2003. Artisanal miners also produced small amounts of fire clay, gravel, dimension stone, and crushed rock for domestic consumption. Commercial interest in the mineral resources of Lesotho was limited to diamonds. The Lesotho Geological Survey has identified 33 kimberlite pipes and 140 dikes, of which 24 were diamondiferous.\n\nThe economy of landlocked Lesotho was based on subsistence agriculture, livestock, and remittances from migrant Basotho miners employed in South African gold mines. However, the number of migrant miners has fallen from an average of 110,000 in 1994, to 61,400 in 2003, and to 58,000 in 2004. The revival of the diamond industry in Lesotho showed hope for some new opportunities for Basotho mineworkers and for replacing related lost government revenues. Exploration for iron, coal, and uranium continued.\n\nENERGY AND POWER\n\nLesotho, as of 1 January 2005, had no proven reserves of oil, natural gas, or coal, and totally lacked any petroleum refining capacity. It was therefore, completely reliant upon imports to meet its refined oil, natural gas, and coal needs.\n\nIn 2004, imports and demand for petroleum products averaged 2,000 barrels per day, each. In 2003, Lesotho had no recorded imports of natural gas or coal.\n\nLesotho's electric power is entirely hydroelectric, and is produced by the Muela hydroelectric facility, which came online in 1999. Muela is part of a jointly financed project with South Africa called the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. The project called for two 34-km (21-mi) tunnels to transport water from Lesotho's rivers to South Africa, with the first delivery in 1996 and maximum operation by 2020. Plans involved the construction of seven dams, as well as a hydroelectric plant that could meet almost all of Lesotho's power needs. In 1999, the first phase of this plant, the 80 MW Muela facility, came online. As of 1 January 2003, Lesotho's installed generating capacity totaled 0.076 GW. Output in 2003 totaled 0.35 billion kWh, with consumption for that year at 0.36 billion kWh.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nLesotho has a wide variety of light industries, which include, among others, tire retreading, tapestry weaving, diamond processing, and production of textiles, shoes, electric lighting, candles, ceramics, explosives, furniture, and fertilizers. Manufacturing depends largely on agricultural inputs to support milling, canning, leather, and jute industries. In the 1980s, the Lesotho National Development Corporation promoted industrial development in the production of fruits and vegetables, tires, beer and soft drinks, parachutes, steel, and wire. In 1991, Lesotho inaugurated a television assembly plant. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based on farm products and a rapidly growing apparel-assembly sector. The garment industry has grown significantly, mainly due to Lesotho qualifying for the trade benefits contained in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily based on subsistence agriculture, especially livestock, although drought has decreased agricultural activity.\n\nIn the early 2000s, there was growth in the manufacturing sector of the economy. Industry held a strong average annual growth of 10% between 1988 and 1998, and accounted for 38% of GDP in 2001. The major industrial contributor in 2000 was the Highlands Water Project. Lesotho has no known oil or natural gas reserves. Oil exploration took place in the 1970s, but those efforts were unsuccessful and exploration ceased.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperatives, and Marketing maintains a research station at Maseru, along with several experimental stations in the field. Lesotho's Geological Survey Department is headquartered in Maseru. The National University of Lesotho, founded in 1966 at Roma, has faculties of science and agriculture. Lesotho Agricultural College, founded in 1955, is located in Maseru.\n\nIn 1987–97, science and engineering students accounted for 19% of college and university enrollments. In 2002, Lesotho had 42 researchers and 26 technicians per million people that were actively engaged in research and development (R&D).\n\nDOMESTIC TRADE\n\nExcept for the northern regions, where Indians monopolized trading activities, domestic trade was handled by Europeans before independence. The Taiwanese also played a role. Nevertheless, more and more Basotho are currently taking out trading licenses. Traders play a central role in wool and mohair marketing, often acting as wool classers as well. The expertise of the traders varies widely. Some have regular suppliers and customers and maintain high quality, while others are prone to careless handling practices, lowering the market value of wool.\n\nAs of 2005, nearly 85% of the workforce was employed in some level of subsistence agriculture. About 35% of male wage earners had jobs in South Africa.\n\nNormal business hours in urban areas are from 8 am to 1 pm and from 2 to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, and from 8 am to 1 pm on Saturday. Banks are open from 8:30 am to 1 pm Monday through Friday, and 9:30 to 11 am on Saturday.\n\nFOREIGN TRADE\n\nLesotho's chief exports are clothing, shoes, and road vehicles. Manufacturing accounted for 65% of exports in 1996. Other exports include wool and mohair, and food and live animals (7% each). The main imports are food, building materials, vehicles, machinery, medicines, and petroleum products.\n\nExports grew an average of 18.1% from 1993 through 1996, but declined slightly in 1998. Between 2001 and 2005 exports grew dramatically from $278.6 million to $749.9 million, an increase of 169% within a four-year period. Merchandise imports grew by 16.2% in 1992, but then declined by 6.9% in 1993 and fell 7.4% in 1994. Imports picked up again between 1995 and 1997, but declined in 1998. Between 2001 and 2005 imports increased from $678.6 million to $1.4 billion, an increase of 103%. In 1996, 66% of exports went to the Southern African Customs Union, 26% to\n\nCountryExportsImportsBalanceWorld358.0799.6-441.6United States159.213.8145.4South Africa151.6616.8-465.2Canada24.80.324.5Other Asia nes13.744.6-30.9Belgium2.81.01.8France-Monaco2.80.52.3Italy-San Marino-Holy See2.81.71.1Ireland0.1…0.1(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nNorth America, and 4% to the EU. Increasingly, the United States has become a favorite destination for Lesotho's exports. In 2003 Lesotho sent 80.1% of its exports to the United States, while 19.2% went to the countries of the Southern African Customs Union and 0.1% to the European Union (EU). During the same year the Southern African Customs Union provided 86% of Lesotho's imports, Asia, 13.2%, and the EU, 0.1%.\n\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nLesotho's chronic balance-of-payments deficit was partially offset by the flow of cash and material goods from Basotho workers in South Africa, but the end of this system in 1999 caused a higher total debt than usual. Revenues from the highlands water project may offset losses.\n\nThe European Intelligence Unit reported that in 2005 the purchasing power parity of Lesotho's exports was $749.9 million while imports totaled $1380 million resulting in a trade deficit of $630.1 million.\n\nBANKING AND SECURITIES\n\nLesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area. The 1974 agreement, which was revised in 1986, provided access to the South African capital market for the Lesotho banking system. Lesotho is responsible for its own monetary policy and controls its own financial institutions, but management of the rand currency and the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the rand area remains the sole responsibility of South Africa. In 1980, the Lesotho Monetary Authority (now the Central Bank of Lesotho) began issuing loti as the national currency, but the South African rand remained legal tender and the loti was pegged at par with the rand.\n\nDemand for credit in the private sector was strong during the 1990s in response to growth in the manufacturing, services, and construction sectors. In contrast, claims on central government were reduced as a result of the IMF-supported Structural Adjustment\n\nCurrent Account-118.8 Balance on goods-381.2 Imports-736.0 Exports354.8 Balance on services-20.1 Balance on income161.4 Current transfers121.3Capital Account23.4Financial Account85.7 Direct investment abroad… Direct investment in Lesotho80.8 Portfolio investment assets… Portfolio investment liabilities… Financial derivatives… Other investment assets0.7 Other investment liabilities4.0Net Errors and Omissions-115.7Reserves and Related Items125.3(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nProgram; in fact, the government was a net saver with the domestic banking system in 1992. In the 1990s, interest rates remained positive in real terms and generally slightly higher than in South Africa due to higher margins.\n\nThe commercial bank sector is dominated by the government-owned Lesotho Bank and the South African-owned Stambic Bank which acquired Barclays Bank's interest in Lesotho. Lesotho Bank was privatized in 1999. The Lesotho Building Finance Corporation merged with Lesotho Bank in April 1993 to facilitate an increase in the scale of domestic mortgage lending. The Lesotho Agricultural Development Bank (LADB) had served to mobilize rural savings and provide agricultural credit, but it was liquidated in 2000.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund reports that in 2001, currency and demand deposits—an aggregate commonly known as M1—were equal to $150.1 million. In that same year, M2—an aggregate equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds—was $231.5 million. The discount rate, the interest rate at which the central bank lends to financial institutions in the short term, was 13%.\n\nNo securities exchange was in operation in Lesotho as of 2003.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nIn 1995, there were at least three insurance companies operating in Lesotho. During the 1998 destruction of commercial life, most firms were not covered by insurance, lengthening the rebuilding process.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE\n\nProceeds from membership in a common customs union with South Africa form the majority of government revenue. Lesotho receives aid from myriad sources, including the United States, World Bank, United Kingdom, EU, and Germany.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimated that in 2005 Lesotho's central government took in revenues of approximately\n\nRevenue and Grants3,617100.0% Tax revenue2,88779.8% Social contributions…… Grants1784.9% Other revenue55215.3%Expenditures3,564100.0% General public services…… Defense…… Public order and safety…… Economic affairs…… Environmental protection…… Housing and community amenities…… Health…… Recreational, culture, and religion…… Education…… Social protection……(…) data not available or not significant.\n\n$738.5 million and had expenditures of $792.1 million. Revenues minus expenditures totaled approximately -$53.6 million. Total external debt was $735 million.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that in 2003, the most recent year for which it had data, central government revenues were m3,617 millionand expenditures were m3,564 million. The value of revenues in US dollars was us$478 million, based on a principal exchange rate for 2003 of us$1 = m7.56475 as reported by the IMF.\n\nTAXATION\n\nIn 1960, a review of the tax structure was undertaken with a view toward ending the dual tax system, which made a distinction between Basotho and non-Basotho. It was decided that a basic tax, previously paid only by Basotho, would be paid by all male residents. A graded tax and a scaled income tax, both payable by all persons irrespective of race or sex, were subsequently imposed. The maximum tax rate for individuals is 35%, and corporations are taxed at a flat rate of 35%. Manufacturing companies are subject to a reduced 15% rate. A 25% withholding tax is paid on dividends, interest and royalties. However, manufacturing companies pay a 15% withholding rate on dividends and royalties. Lesotho has a value-added tax (VAT) system with a standard rate of 14%. However, the VAT for liquor is 15%, while electricity and telecommunications are subject to a 5% VAT.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES\n\nCustoms and duties constitute the predominant source of ordinary revenue. Lesotho, together with Swaziland, Botswana, and Namibia, is a member of a customs union with South Africa; consequently, no tariffs exist on most goods moving among them. South Africa levies and collects the bulk of the customs, sales, and excise duties for the five countries, paying a share determined by an established formula of total customs collections to the other four. Imports from outside the customs union, regardless of ultimate destination, are subject to the same tariff rates.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT\n\nThe government actively encourages foreign investment, particularly investment in manufacturing plants and agricultural projects. The Lesotho National Development Corp. promotes industrial estates, with such attractions as a 15-year discretionary tax holiday or accelerated depreciation allowances, plus LNDC capital participation of up to 25%.\n\nAnnual foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow into Lesotho was $269 million in 1997, but declined steadily for the rest of the decade, amounting to $119 million in 2000. For the period 1997 to 2000, net FDI equaled over one-fifth (21.8%) of its GDP, the highest such ratio in the world. Most FDI is concentrated in textiles, garments, and light manufacture.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Lesotho government's development objectives are based on a food-security policy approach, built around small-scale irrigated agriculture projects and improved rural water supplies. Donors supported the fourth five-year plan (1988–91) with pledges of $390 million. Lesotho receives development assistance from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Canada,Taiwan, the European Union, the World Bank, and various United Nations agencies.\n\nIn 2001, Lesotho negotiated a three-year $35 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Unemployment, poverty, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic are challenges facing further economic development. The sale of the state telecommunications company in 2001 stood as evidence of Lesotho's continuing privatization program. The government in 2003 was committed to public sector reform and market-friendly policies, as illustrated by its support for the Lesotho Public Sector Improvement and Reform Project.\n\nA review of Lesotho's economic performance in 2005 by the IMF welcomed the marked improvement seen across a range of macroeconomic indicators in recent years, noting in particular the lower fiscal deficits and improved balance-of-payments position. It also welcomed the government's commitment to increasing institutional capacity in order to better implement and monitor public spending programs, which will now be formulated in the context of a poverty reduction strategy. However, the IMF indicated that there was room for improvements in the economic policies in order for Lesotho to enhance labor skills, clear bottlenecks in infrastructure and public-sector delivery, and remove legal and administrative impediments to investment.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn the past, many social welfare programs were organized on the local level or by missions. But the need for concerted action to alleviate hardships brought about by the severe droughts led to the creation in 1965 of a Social Welfare Department under the Ministry of Health (later the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare). Community development teams stimulate local initiative by conducting courses and forming voluntary community development committees. The Homemakers' Association, an organization long active in social welfare, has given family-management courses in remote areas under a grant from the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam).\n\nThe roles of women are limited by law and by tradition. Married women are considered legal minors under customary law. They are unable to sign any contract and have no legal standing in a court of law. Domestic violence is also a widespread problem although it is considered unacceptable behavior. The government has pledged to improve the rights of women. Limited resources limit the ability of government to implement child welfare programs.\n\nSome human rights violations were reported, including excessive use of force by police, long pretrial delays, and poor prison conditions. Crime is a serious problem in Lesotho.\n\nHEALTH\n\nLesotho's major health problems, such as pellagra and kwashiorkor, stem from poor nutrition and inadequate hygiene. It was estimated that 44% of children under five years of age were considered malnourished. Famines have resulted from periodic droughts. Approximately 91% of the population had access to safe drinking water and 92% had adequate sanitation.\n\nTuberculosis and venereal diseases are also serious problems. Children up to one year old were vaccinated at the following rates: tuberculosis, 55%; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 58%; polio, 66%; and measles, 82%. Rates for DPT and measles were, respectively, 85% and 77%. About 43% of children suffered from goiter.\n\nThe government of Lesotho is working to rehabilitate two hospitals and is making an overall effort to strengthen health care services. In 2004, there were 5 physicians, 1 pharmacist, and 60 nurses per 100,000 people. Approximately 80% of the population had access to health care services.\n\nAs of 2002, the crude birth rate and overall mortality rate were estimated at, respectively, 30.7 and 16.8 per 1,000 people. The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births was 88.75 in 2005. The total fertility rate has steadily declined to 4.4 children per woman. Of married women aged 15–49, contraceptives were used by 23%. Estimated life expectancy in 2006 was 34.47 years, the third shortest in the world.\n\nThe AIDS crisis in Lesotho is severe. The HIV/AIDS prevalence was 28.90 per 100 adults in 2003, the third highest in the world. As of 2004, there were approximately 320,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. There were an estimated 29,000 deaths from AIDS in 2003.\n\nHOUSING\n\nThe Lesotho Housing and Land Development Corp. builds new housing for sale and rent, and a government-supported development program is building low-cost housing. The government has also begun to encourage private investment and ownership of housing through privatization of banking and legal reforms, the latter of which include the Law Reform Commission and the Land Policy Review Commission, which have been working on legislation to allow women equal rights in access to credit and land ownership.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nA by-product of the long history of missionary activity in Lesotho was the relatively comprehensive development of education. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 13. Primary school covers 7 years of study, followed by 3 years of junior secondary school, and 2 years of high school. Students may choose to attend craft schools after primary school instead of junior high. Those who complete junior high may opt for a two-year trade school instead of senior high. The languages of instruction are Sesotho and English. From the fifth year of primary school onwards, all instruction is conducted in English. The academic year runs from August to May.\n\nIn 2001, about 21% of children between the ages of three and five were enrolled in some type of preschool program. Primary school enrollment in 2003 was estimated at about 86% of age-eligible students. The same year, secondary school enrollment was about 22% of age-eligible students; 18% for boys and 27% for girls. It is estimated that about 67% of all students complete their primary education. The student-to-teacher ratio for primary school was at about 47:1 in 2003.\n\nThe University of Lesotho, Botswana, and Swaziland (formerly known as Pius XII College), founded in 1964 at Roma, was unilaterally dissolved in October 1975 by Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, who then renamed it the National University of Lesotho. Lesotho Agricultural College, at Maseru, was founded in 1955. In 2003, about 3% of the tertiary age population were enrolled in some type of higher education program. The adult literacy rate for 2004 was estimated at about 81.4%, with 73.7% for men and 90.3% for women.\n\nAs of 2003, public expenditure on education was estimated at 8.9% of GDP, or 18.5% of total government expenditures.\n\nLIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nThe Government Archive in Maseru has records dating from 1869. The Lesotho National Library, also in the capital, holds 88,000 volumes. The Thomas Mofolo Library at the National University of Lesotho is the largest library in the country with more than 170,000 books. The British Council maintains a library in Maseru, with 6,270 volumes and there is a library of 10,000 volumes at the Lesotho Agricultural College. The National Teachers Training College in Maseru also has a notable library. The Lesotho National Library Service, founded in 1976, sponsors three public library branches: Leribe, Mafeteng, and Mokhotlong. The Lesotho Library Association was founded in 1978. The Lesotho National Museum, at Maseru, has collections on archaeology, ethnography, and geology. The Morija Museum has collections in the same fields.\n\nMEDIA\n\nThe government operates postal and telephone services; the exchange at Maseru has been automatic since 1963. An earth-satellite station was opened in 1986. In 2003, there were an estimated 13 mainline telephones for every 1,000 people; about 21,000 people were on a waiting list for telephone service installation. The same year, there were approximately 42 mobile phones in use for every 1,000 people.\n\nGovernment-owned Radio Lesotho broadcasts in English and Sesotho; it is the only station with a national range. There were seven privately owned radio stations in the country in 2005. The government-owned Lesotho Television is the only television station in the country. In 2003, there were an estimated 61 radios and 35 television sets for every 1,000 people. The same year, 10 of every 1,000 people had access to the Internet.\n\nMphatlalatsane is a daily Sesotho newspaper published in Maseru, with a 2002 circulation of 4,000. The Moeletsi oa Basotho is a weekly published by the Roman Catholic Church with a circulation of 20,000. The Lesotho Evangelical Church also publishes a newspaper, Leselinyana le Lesotho (The Light of Lesotho ), which comes out every other week with a circulation of 15,000. Other newspapers, with their 2002 circulations, include Lentsoe la Basotho (14,000) and Lesotho Today (7,000), both weeklies published by the Department of Information; Mohlanka (6,000); Moafrika (3,500); Makatolle (2,000); and the English weekly, The Mirror (4,000).\n\nThe Constitution provides freedom of speech and the press, and the government is said to respect these rights in practice.\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nCooperative unions that are partly government-financed and government-sponsored, consumer cooperatives, artisan cooperatives, and the Progressive Farmers play an important part in economic and social development. There are also more than 100 active agricultural marketing and credit societies.\n\nNational youth organizations include the Association of Youth Cultural Clubs, Lesotho Scouts Association, Lesotho Work Camps Association, YMCA/YWCA, Lesotho Youth Federation, and the Student Representative Council of Lesotho. There are several sports organizations and clubs throughout the country, including branches of the Special Olympics. The Lesotho National Council of Women offers programs and activities to support and promote the development of women.\n\nVolunteer service organizations, such as the Lions Clubs International, are present. The Red Cross, Caritas, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and Habitat for Humanity are active in the country.\n\nTOURISM, TRAVEL, AND RECREATION\n\nThe Lesotho National Tourist Board promotes tourism, which is increasing but still underdeveloped.\n\nPermanent tourist camps are established in remote scenic areas for pony-trekking parties. The first such camp, consisting of bath and kitchen-equipped grass huts, was built at Marakabeis, near the end of the Mountain Road. Although lacking in game, Lesotho has spectacular natural attractions in its mountains and in Malutsenyane Falls, as well as excellent trout-fishing grounds. The rock paintings near Teyateyaneng are also a potentially important tourist site. The country's first national park, Sehlabathebe Mountain National Park, was established in 1970 in the Qacha's Nek District. There is a gambling casino in Maseru, along with mountain resorts and lodges.\n\nVisas are not required for stays of up to 30 days, but a valid passport, proof of sufficient funds, and onward/return ticket are necessary. Vaccination against yellow fever is highly recommended and sometimes required. In 2003, there were 360,955 foreign visitors who arrived in Lesotho. Of the visitors, 230,946 came from South Africa.\n\nIn 2005, the US Department of State estimated the daily expenses for travel in Maseru at $181; in other areas, $84.\n\nFAMOUS BASOTHO\n\nMoshoeshoe (or Moshesh, 1786–1870), a chief of the Bakoena tribe in what was then northern Basutoland, is acclaimed as the founder of the Basotho nation. Moshoeshoe II (1938–96) served as king of Lesotho from October 1966 until January 1996, when he was killed in an automobile accident. Crown Prince Letsie David Mohato (b.1963), who had served as king during his father's 1989–94 exile, returned to the throne in February 1996 as King Letsie III. Chief Leabua Jonathan (1914–87), prime minister of Lesotho from its inception until 1986, was a leader in the drive for independence.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nLesotho has no territories or colonies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nD and B's Export Guide to Lesotho.

A tiny mountain country, Lesotho is completely surrounded by South Africa, and Lesotho's history is closely related to that of its powerful neighbor. When wars swept southern Africa during the late 1700s and early 1800s and wiped out large numbers of the population, remnants of the various nations fled into the highlands of what is now Lesotho. Moshoeshoe (pronounced Mo-shwe-shwe) the Great gave them protection. Building a stronghold called Thaba Bosiu (Mountain of Night) about fifteen miles from the capital city of Maseru, in 1824 Moshoeshoe united his approximately 21,000 followers into the Basotho nation. Known for his wisdom and statesmanship, Moshoeshoe is the subject of many works in African literature. The spirit of Moshoeshoe lives on in the pride of the citizens of Lesotho in their independence, their traditional crafts, and in their families.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, from 1856 to 1868, the British and the Boer settlers tried unsuccessfully to defeat the Basotho. When in 1868 Moshoeshoe asked Britain for protection, Basutoland became a British Protectorate. After Moshoeshoe died in 1870, the territory was placed under the rule of the British Cape Colony, which tried to disarm the Basotho but was repulsed. In 1884 Basutoland was reestablished as a British protectorate governed by a British colonial administrator. Whites were forbidden to acquire land, and Britain ensured that Basutoland would not be absorbed by neighboring white-ruled colonies. In 1966 the protectorate of Basutoland became the independent Kingdom of Lesotho. During the 1980s political instability in South Africa, where 250,000 Lesotho nationals worked in mines, and South African control of the Highland Water Project, exacerbated Lesotho's own internal conflicts. A bloodless military coup in 1986 led to several years of changing government structures and political instability. In 1998 South Africa and Botswana intervened in an outbreak of civil violence that devastated the capital city Maseru.\n\nIn 2001 King Letsie III ruled as the head of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. There being little land suitable for agriculture, the people of Lesotho are primarily herders who live in small family units far from their neighbors. The people speak Sesotho (also known as southern Sotho), a Bantu language they share with many of the Bantu inhabitants of South Africa from whom they were separated by the boundaries imposed on Africa by the European colonial powers. English is the second official language.\n\nHistorical Evolution: French missionaries of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society first brought Western formal education to Lesotho during the 1830s. The schools were few in number and low in enrollment. Schools concentrated on teaching reading and writing at a very elementary level and teaching simple vocational skills for boys and housecrafts for girls. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Roman Catholic missionaries settled in Lesotho and also opened schools. During the 1930's Roman Catholicism expanded, and by the middle of the 1980s, the Roman Catholic Church and the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the successor of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, each enrolled 40 percent of the country's primary school student population. The focus in the early days was on religious purposes and economic necessity. Secondary schools only came into being in 1948 when the first four were built, of which only one had senior classes. Examinations for junior and senior secondary schools were set in South Africa until 1961 when the senior schools switched from the South African Matriculation exam to the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC).\n\nThus, for more than a century education was almost exclusively the domain of the missionaries. Even though Lesotho was a Protectorate, the British had no real interest in the education of the Basotho, and until after Independence in 1966, the missionaries were responsible for most aspects of education—school organization, curriculum provision, payment of teachers' salaries, teacher professional support, and provision of facilities. Much of the time church halls were used as classrooms, and often teaching and learning were conducted in the open air. Lesotho's harsh winters were not conducive to effective learning.\n\nOriginally teacher training was done in colleges governed by the missions. In 1947 there were four colleges, and this was increased to seven by 1959. In 1975 the National Teacher Training College replaced the various small Teacher Training Colleges operated mainly by churches. Missions were equally concerned with vocational training, and \"industrial schools\" were founded to teach both boys and girls relevant skills. The Lerotholi Technical Institute was founded after the people of Lesotho, on the initiative of Paramount Chief Lerotholi, contributed money toward the building costs. During the 1970s the Lerotholi Polytechnic was expanded, and vocational subjects were introduced in a number of high schools.\n\nWhenever possible citizens of the then Basutoland would go to neighboring South Africa, a fellow British Commonwealth country, to obtain an education. However, when South Africa introduced the Bantu Education Act, its first educational legislation bringing into effect the segregationist values espoused by apartheid, the landlocked mountainous nation had no option but to develop its own educational programs, and today its education system reflects little of South Africa's system. The Lesotho educational system has, in several respects, developed in opposition to that evolving in South Africa. Lesotho's geo-political situation has encouraged a certain amount of external financial aid, a great deal of which has been for educational development. Consequently, multinational characteristics are apparent in some of the developing educational structures.\n\nYet, despite the outside help, and even though the government of this country has been involved in education since the 1920s, sharing responsibility for its provision with the churches, much of the formal education system is still run by missions and is largely administered by the three largest churches—the Roman Catholic Church, the Lesotho Evangelical Church, and the Anglican Church of Lesotho—under the direction of the Ministry of Education. Until the mid-1970s Lesotho shared a common examinations board and a common university with the other two former British Protectorates in the region, Swaziland and Botswana.\n\nLesotho, with one of the highest literacy rates in Africa of 72 percent for males and 93 percent for females, has a traditionally British-style formal education system that still is Euro-centric rather than Afro-centric. The Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC), set in England, is the final external exam that students take at the end of Form E, the fifth year of high school. The criteria for education and examinations, as well as the higher education that follows the school leaving exam, are thus still to a large extent set in England and not in Maseru. English is both the medium of instruction and a subject taught. It is compulsory to obtain a pass in English if one wishes to pass the COSC. Other areas of the curriculum such as history, geography, biology show evidence of similar concerns. None of the textbooks are written for the African situation. Most references are to flora and fauna, or geographical places that occur only in Europe and the United States. Historical events are never portrayed from an African perspective. Abstract concepts provide few opportunities for practical, hands on learning experiences. Attempts to complement materials received from England and from the United States have been undertaken.\n\nAt Independence in 1966 the United Nations and donor agencies helped identify the educational programs they felt most needed to be supported and supplied \"experts,\" mostly of foreign origin, and funds. The focus was on curriculum development, and national programs became attached to international activities. When the efforts of the United Nations and other donor agencies slowed, the World Bank became one of Lesotho's chief educational advisers. While the Bank stressed \"selfreliance,\" it also focused on the perceived need of its financial backers and of transnational corporations to make the largest possible profit. Consequently, there was what many have described as a new kind of economic colonialism. The focus in education was less on what the people in the country needed to help their children mature to their true potential and more on the need to educate and train workers who would supply the international markets with goods and services. Because of the inherited structures of authority that place complete trust in the wisdom of the King, and as parents were often illiterate and unable to fulfil their role of letting the King know their wishes and anxieties, educational structures foreign to the needs and the character of the people of Lesotho have once again been imposed on them. The criteria set for them by others cannot be met. The resultant descent into international debt and the consequent destruction of the education system, which has become less important than the servicing of the international debt, will continue to put education far beyond the reach of many.\n\nPolitical, Social, & Cultural Bases: As has been the case in other African countries, Lesotho's choice of English as a national language and as the medium of instruction, in a country where Sesotho is the mother tongue for the majority of the people, has created a dilemma for educators and students alike. Officially the medium of instruction in Lesotho's schools is Sesotho until about the fourth grade when the medium of instruction becomes English. In reality, however, a mixture of languages is often used until secondary schools, and even then students have very little opportunity to use English. The National University of Lesotho has special programs to improve the communication skills of new entrants. These programs do not, however, come to grips with the under-lying issues faced by students and educators in the Kingdom of Lesotho.\n\nIt is an extremely exacting requirement for students whose first language is Sesotho to speak English as fluently as those who speak it as a first language, to study all subjects in a language totally foreign in style, cultural base and concept to their own, and to have to compete with others in their mother tongue. Furthermore, in a newly independent nation, being able to decide on the national language rather than having one imposed on the country, is a moment of great national and cultural pride. Not being able to use that language as the medium of instruction throughout the education system creates the implicit suggestion that country's own language is inadequate and therefore inferior. And this is definitely not a desirable attitude to have in a nation that is going through the process of decolonization.\n\nSince one-half the world's scientific knowledge is available in English and those who have attained the necessary English language skills have access to the international world of science, technology, commerce, and politics as well as the Internet, it would seem that a Euro-centric bias in education would allow greater access to international education and research. It can, however, also be seen as one of the reasons for the high failure and drop out rate, especially in those cases where students are not adequately prepared to live between two cultures in a way their parents were never expected to.\n\nThe dichotomy that the children of Lesotho live in becomes apparent when one remembers that, even in modern times, traditional African society is centered around the extended family homestead, the principal social unit. Education of the young is the responsibility of the entire community that tries to instill values of respect and obedience. Each member of the community shares responsibility for the whole community. Thus, asking a young boy to be a herd boy and take responsibility for the community's cattle and sheep is not considered child labor, but merely the chore assigned to this member of the community. The whole community transmits the cultural knowledge, ways, and traditions that are related to children's surroundings, to prepare them not only for adulthood and for employment, but for every stage of life, from birth to what is called being \"almost an ancestor.\"\n\nBy contrast, Western formal education, an import often in direct contrast to traditional African education, strives for change. It relies less on the lived values and knowledge of the community than on curriculum and an abstract examination system set by faceless entities. In Lesotho's case the latter are totally uninvolved people who reside somewhere in Britain, setting the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate with British children in mind who have grown up far from the arid mountain regions of Lesotho. The students of Lesotho negotiate this cultural rift every day, yet little attention has been paid to helping them deal with what can often be an almost schizophrenic experience between two realities. Despite the disruptive nature of Western style formal education, parents generally wish their children to have access to a Western style education, especially because it will give access to formal sector employment. Yet, they also wish them to be grounded in the traditional practices of the Lesotho culture. At present the students in Lesotho's education system have few role models who can accompany them on this path.\n\nThe process of acculturation and of learning to live between cultures is made even more difficult for the children of Lesotho when fathers are part of the migrant labor force and spend long periods in the gold mines of South Africa and the mothers have to take on more responsibility than usual. The continuous absence of large numbers of the male population is destructive to cultural structures in general. The extended family system has traditionally provided a great deal of security for all its members. Yet with so many of its members gone, there is a new tension that has lasting effects on the academic progress of Lesotho's children. Consequently, the place of the children in the society often becomes ambiguous, and they exhibit negative attitudes toward formal learning. The absence of fathers could be part of the problem behind both the high drop out rate in Lesotho's schools and the relatively small number of students who go beyond primary school.\n\nApproximately 25 percent of children do not attend school, particularly in rural areas where families involved in subsistence activities need the help of their children to survive. In many cases families cannot afford the costs associated with school attendance. Uniforms, books, and other educational materials are beyond the means of many families where family stress, poverty, the spread of HIV/AIDS, and divorce have led to a rise in child homelessness and abandonment, creating growing numbers of street children. Boys are more affected by nonattendance than girls. Even though in traditional rural Basotho society, livestock herding by young boys is a rite of passage and a prerequisite to manhood in the community, the absence of fathers makes this a heavy burden when boys must often tend flocks all day for months at a time. The legal working age is twelve.\n\nSome of the main challenges facing Lesotho's educators are the lack of financial resources needed to meet the growing demand for well educated local teachers, the need for literacy and for vocational and technical training outside the formal academic setting. Attempts are being made to introduce more practical subjects and so to make education relevant. However, one of the spillovers of British education is that these subjects are still regarded as second rate, inferior to a purely academic education that leads to a position of status in the community as well as to white collar jobs.\n\nIn 1998, the government announced plans to eliminate school fees to help more children gain access to education. Yet, although the government has devoted substantial resources to primary and secondary education, and education takes up approximately 25 percent of the country's budget, children's rights and welfare have not been adequately addressed.\n\nEducation is not compulsory even at primary levels as the government lacks the resources to finance it fully. This situation is due partially to the increasing international debt, and Lesotho's increasing structural dependence on the rest of the world, South Africa in particular. The country is increasingly reliant upon remittances from migrant workers. Additionally, the interests rates imposed on foreign loans made by the international banks and the restructuring demands made by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, affects the country's ability to provide essential health and education services.\n\nConstitutional & Legal Foundations\n\nAfter Independence, education in Lesotho did not attain the hoped for results. By 1977 the drop out rate continued to be high, the quality of education deteriorated, and student and teacher motivation declined. Instead of appointing another Commission of Inquiry that would function in the usual top-down bureaucratic manner, the government organized a Pitso, a nationwide dialogue on education. Using the traditional channels of authority and communication, this dialogue started in the Chief's Courts in the various villages and culminated in a national Education Dialogue in Maseru. This commission directly involved the people at the grassroots level making those most affected by education participants rather than a target group for a \"learned commission.\" Recommendations were made that influenced a number of developments in education. Following these recommendations the Lesotho Government decided on an Education Sector Survey Task Force that made recommendations on all aspects of the education process. It remains difficult to provide education for all, to respond to the needs of the people, yet still meet the developmental needs of Lesotho and the increasing demands of a profit oriented capitalist world intent on globalization. However, despite all these obstacles, some of the results are to be seen in significant developments that took place shortly after the Maseru Education Dialogue.\n\nAn efficient nonformal Distance Teaching Center and a Curriculum Development Center have been set up. A book supply unit has been set up, and a program to build classrooms was launched. Two associations dealing with formal and nonformal education were formed: the Lesotho Educational Research Association (for formal education) and the Lesotho Association (for nonformal education).\n\nEducational System—Overview\n\nLesotho's school system consists of twelve school years. The seven years of primary, or junior school (Grades 1-7), culminate in the Primary School Leaving Certificate. The three years of junior secondary school (high school—Forms A, B, C) culminate in the Junior Certificate (JC). The two years of higher secondary school (high school—Forms D—E) lead to the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC) at the Ordinary Level (O levels).\n\nThere are very high dropout rates throughout primary and secondary school. In 1990, 22.6 percent of students enrolled in primary education were repeaters. The government has insufficient resources to provide enough secondary schools and to provide alternate education or training for those who do not complete primary or secondary school. Poverty and traditional constraints play a major role here.\n\nPreprimary & Primary Education\n\nGeneral Survey: There are very few preprimary or nursery schools in Lesotho and only one in Maseru. Near-ly all preprimary schools are privately operated. Consequently, only a very small percentage of children are enrolled.\n\nWhile the Ministry of Education has authority over syllabuses and examinations, and the government aids individual schools, often by subsidizing the salaries of some of the teachers, most primary schools are operated by the missions of the three main religious churches. Influenced by the British colonial system, primary education, for which a tuition fee is charged and which is not compulsory, consists of seven levels called standards. Until the end of 1966, there was an eight-year primary system, beginning with Grades A and B and continuing through Standards 1-6. The seven-year primary school system was introduced in 1967. In 1980 only 12 percent of those who entered Standard 1 completed Standard 7. In 1990 only 14 percent of children who entered primary school proceeded to secondary education.\n\nAt the age of six or seven, children attend comprehensive, academically oriented schools and study a core of general education subjects. Sesotho is the medium of instruction in the early grades, and English is taught as a school subject. The transfer to English is made as soon as possible, during the third or fourth year of schooling, and definitely by the time students reach high school. Sesotho is then taught as a school subject. Other subjects taught are mathematics, science, and social science. Gardening, handiwork, needlework, physical training, art, music, handwriting, and religious knowledge are also offered.\n\nOften there are much older children and even some adults in the elementary school classrooms. However, this circumstance is not as common as it used to be when Western style formal education was first introduced, and it is not generally regarded as a problem either by the students or the teachers.\n\nAt the completion of the seventh year of junior school, an exam prepared by the Department of Education is administered. The result of this exam is the most important criterion for admission into secondary education, or high school. However, because of the shortage of secondary school places, passing the Lesotho Primary School Leaving Certificate, does not guarantee admission into a high school. Only about one in seven or eight of the more than 113,000 students enrolled in primary school can go on to secondary school.\n\nUrban & Rural Schools: Primary school teaching varies in the different areas and is largely dependent on the qualification and level of sophistication of the teachers. The latter will vary in the rural and in the urban areas. The acute shortage of teachers has of necessity led to the use of unqualified teachers.\n\nSecondary Education\n\nGeneral Survey: More than 60 secondary schools in Lesotho provide an education for approximately 20,000 students. Once students have completed their primary education and parents can afford tuition and board, students begin secondary education, or high school. Entrance into a secondary school depends on whether students have passed the Primary School Leaving Certificate Exam and whether seats are available in a secondary school. Secondary education is neither free nor compulsory, fees are charged for tuition and books, and all secondary schools are comprehensive, geared towards the goal of obtaining entrance to a university. More recently more practical education in the form of optional vocational courses are being offered. Most schools provide study periods within the school day for preparation of homework. Extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs occur after the school day. Many schools provide boarding facilities for students.\n\nCurriculum—Examinations, Diplomas: Forms A through C, the first three years of junior secondary school, lead to the Junior Certificate (JC), administered originally by the Examinations Council of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, but more recently by the Lesotho Ministry of Education. Forms D and E, the last two years of High School, prepare students for the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (COSC) Examinations at the Ordinary (O) level. Only three schools in the three countries, and none in Lesotho, offer classes that lead to the Advanced (A) level examinations. As the JC is the most common entry-level qualification for employment, there has been greater emphasis on the curriculum for Forms A through C. Consequently, the syllabus leading up to the O level exam has often been unrelated to the syllabus of the previous years, causing students to have to cram the entire syllabus into their last two years of study. Efforts have been made for greater coordination between the two levels.\n\nThe curriculum leading to the JC exam is based on seven subjects a year, with forty 40-minute periods each week. The core subjects are English—nine periods a week; integrated science—eight periods a week; mathematics—seven periods a week; Sesotho—four periods a week. Four periods a week are devoted to development studies, geography, or history. And four periods are devoted to a practical subject such as agricultural studies, typing or bookkeeping, domestic science, or woodwork.\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements of the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examinations (COSC), the Lesotho Ministry of Education recommends that students choose the arts curriculum that consists of seven subjects requiring forty periods per week and requiring the following subjects: the core curriculum—English language, five periods per week; English literature, four periods per week; mathematics, seven periods per week; biology, seven periods per week; Sesotho or French, five hours per week; development studies, geography, or history, four or five hours per week of two subjects from the group; one practical subject, five hours per week.\n\nShould students wish to follow the Cambridge Science Curriculum, the core curriculum consists of five periods per week of English language, seven periods per week of mathematics, five or six periods per week of biology, and eight hours per week of physical science.\n\nPromotion at the end of each year is based on final exams and on overall evaluation of the students' work during the year. The principal, the teachers, and the community set the grading standards. Often grading standards vary due to the fluctuating availability of teachers and because some courses are often not taught in the more remote parts of the country. Consequently, the examination results do not always reflect the students' aptitude for further education.\n\nIncreasingly there has been diversification at the secondary school level. At the JC level technical and commercial subjects are available. And in Forms D and E, agricultural and higher primary teacher training is offered. More than 50 percent of students in Lesotho leave school after Form C. The high dropout rate is largely due to the fact that tuition, books, and boarding are too expensive for students from that part of the world.\n\nTeachers: Secondary school teachers are, theoretically, trained at the postsecondary level. In practice, however, there is a severe shortage of qualified secondary school teachers and those who are qualified will often elect not to teach in remote areas or in areas where there is no electricity or running water. Courses offered depend on the ability of any area to attract qualified teachers. As a result of the teacher shortage, there is a heavy reliance on expatriate teachers, in some areas as high as twothirds, supplied amongst others by the United States or through the Peace Corps. This state of affairs provides neither continuity nor cultural understanding of the pupils in the educational system.\n\nHigher Education\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, Basotho students could study at Fort Hare College (the University of Fort Hare) in the Cape Province in South Africa. The colonial government paid the college three hundred pounds per year for this service and was represented at its board of governors. In 1958 this agreement was terminated by South Africa.\n\nThe National University of Lesotho situated in Roma, about 34 kilometers. from Maseru, the University of Botswana, and the University of Swaziland are offshoots of a common university. The Universities had their origin in the Pius XII College, a Catholic University College that was founded by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Southern Africa on April 8, 1945 on a temporary site at Roma. The objective of the College was to provide African Catholic students with a post-matriculation (high school exit exam) and religious education. In 1946 the College moved to its permanent site, and by 1959 the student population had increased to 171 students from the original five. By 1963 the number of students had grown to 180 and necessary facilities had been added.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1964, Pius XII College was an \"Associate College\" of the University of South Africa in Pretoria, a distance education institution that examined the students and offered degrees in Arts, Science, Commerce, and Education. In the early 1960s, as apartheid legislation in South Africa became more restrictive, problems arose with regard to student residence requirements. Consequently an independent, non-denominational university was established by Royal Charter through the High Commission for Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Swaziland. On January 1, 1964, under a Charter granted by Queen Elizabeth II of England, the Pius XII College became an integral part of the independent, nondenominational University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Swaziland. The University was funded equally by the governments of all three countries, but the main campus was in Lesotho, and there was no university presence in the other two countries, with the exception of the beginnings of the Faculty of Agriculture in Luyengo, Swaziland. After independence in 1966, campuses were established in Gaborone, Botswana, and in Kwaluseni, Swaziland. In 1966, after independence was granted to the present day Botswana and Lesotho, the name was changed to the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, which offered its first degrees in 1967 in four-year programs in Science and Education, and a Law degree which included two years of study at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nOn October 20, 1975, the Roma campus in Lesotho withdrew to become the National University of Lesotho. In 2001, the student population was around two thousand, of which about twenty were postgraduate (master's degree or higher) students. Degrees are offered in the faculties of Agriculture, Humanities, Law, Science, Social Science, and Education. Advanced degrees are offered in the faculties of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences. The University also houses the Institute of Extra Mural Studies, the Institute of Southern African Studies, and the Institute of Education.\n\nAdmission requirements to degree courses are the COSC with a credit in English language and in mathematics if the student wishes to follow the B.Sc. Program or the Matriculation Certificate of the Republic of South Africa, provided credit has been gained for English at the Higher Grade Level. Bachelor's degree programs are generally four years in duration with the academic year broken into two semesters of fifteen weeks each. A final exam is administered at the end of each year. In the grading system, the grade of A, a First Class degree, is rarely given. Grades of B and C are considered very strong grades and to receive a D is to receive a respectable grade. In order to receive a degree, an overall D average must be obtained.\n\nIn line with the British influence, master's degree programs are normally research oriented, though some course work may be required. Master's degrees are offered in the Arts, Science, and in Education. Ph.D. programs are research oriented. The professors at the National University of Lesotho are well qualified. Many are expatriates, which gives the university an international character.\n\nAt the National University of Lesotho, the building housing the Thomas Mofolo Library, named after the Mosotho author Thomas Mofolo, was built with funds provided by the World Council of Churches and the World University Services. It was officially opened on April 1, 1966. The library has more than 125,000 volumes of books and bound periodicals, and its Information System is currently being automated. The library is to join the Southern African Bibliographic Network based in South Africa and to use its facilities to catalogue library materials and inter-library lending and is preparing records for input into the Pan African Development information System based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
