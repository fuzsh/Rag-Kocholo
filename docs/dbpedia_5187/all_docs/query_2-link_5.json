Another goal I have, about this blog post, is to state to you, in case you already didn’t know that you need to know, that Lestoho is one of the smallest countries in Africa, both in terms of land area and population: It is landlocked within South Africa and has a population of approximately 2 million people. What you also need to know is that Lesotho is known for its high elevation, which contributes to its relatively cold climate compared to other African countries. Never underestimate how mountainous terrains and their position in the southern hemisphere also are; this means that it experiences colder temperatures, in Lesotho, particularly during the winter months, given that the lowest temperature ever recorded in Lesotho is -16 degrees Fahrenheit, or — 27 degrees Celcius."
