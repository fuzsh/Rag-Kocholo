The district is commonly called Berea, but the capital is almost always known as Teyateyaneng. Similarly, the capital of Leribe is also known as Hlotse.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Councils of Lesotho page.\n\nThe districts were further subdivided into wards until 2005-04-11, when a set of community councils was supposedly introduced.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nLesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Lesotho lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nChange history:\n\n~1910: Basutoland reorganized. New Berea district formed from part of old Berea; new Leribe formed from parts of old Berea and Leribe; Mafeteng formed from part of Thaba Bosigo; Maseru formed from parts of Berea and Thaba Bosigo; Mohale's Hoek formed from Kornet Spruit; Qacha's Nek formed from parts of Berea, Leribe, and Quthing; new Quthing formed from part of old Quthing.\n\n~1944: Leribe district split into Butha-Buthe and Leribe; Qacha's Nek district split into Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek.\n\n~1980: Thaba-Tseka district formed from parts of Leribe (412 km.²), Maseru (1,782 km.²), Mokhotlong (496 km.²), and Qacha's Nek (1,580 km.²). Prior to this change, the nine former districts had FIPS codes from LT01 to LT09. Each number was nine less than the present-day code.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nThe apostrophes are sometimes omitted. In older sources, hyphens are sometimes omitted or replaced by spaces.\n\nBerea: Teyateyaneng (variant)\n\nButha-Buthe: Botha-Bothe (variant)\n\nPopulation history:\n\nDistrict 1946-05-07 1966-04-14 1976-04-12 1986-04-14 1996-04-14 2006-04-09 Berea 58,026118,200146,100 194,600 240,754 250,006 Butha-Buthe 35,44463,200 77,200 100,600 109,192 110,320 Leribe 99,030161,500206,600 258,000 300,160 293,369 Mafeteng 69,629119,100154,300 195,600 211,970 192,621 Maseru 106,614201,800257,800 311,100 385,869 431,998 Mohale's Hoek 66,185109,900136,300 164,400 184,034 176,928 Mokhotlong 38,17660,200 73,500 74,700 85,628 97,713 Qacha's Nek 44,94163,000 76,500 64,000 71,665 69,749 Quthing 45,80972,700 88,500 110,400 126,342 124,048 Thaba-Tseka 104,100 126,353 129,881 Totals 563,854969,6001,216,8001,577,5001,841,9671,876,633\n\n1946 data come from source [5]. 1966 and 1976 data are from source [6]. 1996 data are from sources [1], [2], and [4]. 2006 results are from source [8].\n\nSources:"
