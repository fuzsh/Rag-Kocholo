        "text": "Photo source Fliker Photo Fiverlocker CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Lesotho lowlands\n\nLesotho has a long history of contestation over land allocation and tenure systems. An alliance with the British in 1868 by the country’s monarchy to prevent Boer invasion had the effect of transforming the institution of chieftainship into an extension of colonial administration3. Two legal systems have regulated access to land – customary law (as codified by colonial administrators) and statute. Lesotho gained independence from the British, along with Botswana in 1966. Since the 1970’s a range of land laws have been passed. These have attempted to ‘modernise’ land administration while simultaneously seeking to limit the power of customary chiefs and regulate their land allocation functions, particularly in urban areas.\n\nLesotho’s post-independence history has seen intense political contestation over the relative powers of the monarchy, the chiefs, the prime minister, and the administration. The country gained a new constitution in 1993, but deep social and political divisions have persisted resulting in recurrent episodes of instability in the country4. Interventions by the World Bank and bilateral donors over time have been decisive in changing policies on land allocation and administration5.\n\nBy 2010 Lesotho had one of the most migration-dependent economies in the world6. Today Lesotho remains one of most unequal and poorest countries globally with a GDP/capita of $1,2227.\n\nLand legislation and regulations\n\nPrior to independence, land in Lesotho was held in trust by the King for Basotho people. Hereditary chiefs presided over customary courts and were responsible for allocating land to married men. Women were ineligible to access land in their own right. However, as in many African countries colonial administrators in Lesotho sought to codify African customary law to enable it to be more easily administered by the colonial judicial system”8. In doing so they remade traditions through the promulgation of a customary code in 1903 known as the Laws of Lerotholi.\n\nThe code gave the chiefs power to allocate land, as well as take away rights to land which was deemed to be improperly used. In terms of the code, land could not be alienated and people could only acquire use rights9. A court judgment in 1955 required that chiefs undertake land allocation “fairly and impartially” – a ruling which at the time did not imply that land could be allocated to women. Land allocation and administration functions were further elaborated in new legislation formulated in terms of Roman Dutch law10. These included a Land Procedure Act and a Deeds Registry Act of 1967 along with the Land Act and the Administration of Lands Act, both passed in 1973. The latter Act remained unimplemented before the different laws were amalgamated into the 1979 Land Act.\n\nSection 3(1) of the 1979 Land Act stated that “land in Lesotho is vested absolutely and irrevocably in the Basotho Nation and is held by the Head of State (the King), as representative of the nation”. The Land Act removed the direct powers of traditional authorities to allocate land and transferred these to Village Land Committees (VLCs). These were chaired by chiefs, who were represented in an ex officio capacity11. The dilution of the land allocation functions of chiefs caused tensions between traditional authorities and the State12. The law also sought to put in place mechanisms to grant titles and create servitudes under the control of the central state, primarily in the urban sphere. Traditional authorities argued that the Act was unconstitutional as in their view only the King had authority to allocate or withdraw land rights13.\n\nThe Land Act of 1979 set out three broad types of land right:\n\nAllocation of land certificates via Land Allocation Committees in rural areas. These certificates conferred the rights to use and occupy the land, but not to transfer it. These land rights could be passed to the widow and then to heirs designated by surviving family members. These land rights could be revoked for public purposes14.\n\nLeasehold in urban areas issued by Urban Land Committees and officials in the Department of Land, Survey and Physical Planning which are subject to ground rent changes. Lease durations ranged from 90 years for residential properties to 60 years for industrial and commercial purposes15. People who wanted to apply for a lease had to pay a surveyor to survey the land parcel. Very little land registration took place due to a variety of factors including high costs of survey, time consuming bureaucracy as well as the liability to pay ground rent on the property once registered. These measures were also resisted by chiefs as they eroded their land allocation powers16.\n\nThe state also issued licences to enable people to access agricultural land within legally gazetted urban boundaries. These could be terminated on three months’ notice without compensation17.\n\nThe 1979 Land Act allowed for the declaration of Selected Development Areas (SDA’s) in which land could be acquired for newly planned settlements and commercial development along with the upgrading of informal settlements18.\n\nA Land Policy Review Commission published a report in 1987 with recommendations on tenure reform, but reportedly there was no political will to implement the Commission’s recommendations19.\n\nIn 2005 a Local Government Act (passed in 1997) finally came into force which formally removed land allocation functions from chiefs to local land committees.\n\nIn 2008 the Government of Lesotho signed a five-year agreement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation – a new USA foreign aid vehicle. The agreement known as the Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC) focused on modernising Lesotho’s land administration system and measures to stimulate growth of a land market20. $20 million was allocated for development of new land laws, institutional change, and regularisation of tenure. At this point 25% of the population was urbanised21.\n\nThe draft of a Land Bill abandoned in 2004 was influential in the framing of the new 2010 Land Act. This Act set out to create a land market and make land transactable. However there was resistance to both the Land Act and Land Administration Authority Act from across the political spectrum as it was perceived as an external imposition. The main opposition party declared they would repeal the Land Act if they came to power. However “when the opposition came to power they quietly reversed their views on the new laws particularly in light of public support for regularisation and improved service delivery at LAA”22.\n\nNoteworthy elements in the 2010 Land Act include:\n\nreducing the turn-around time for Ministerial consents for conditional leaseholds;\n\na focus on mass regularisation of titles including a scheme to regularise 50 000 leasehold titles in Maseru;\n\nrelaxing conditions regulating foreign land ownership restricted to commercial and industrial leases, stepping down from the original requirement of a 51% Basotho shareholding in the enterprise to a 20% holding where the value of land could form part of the shareholding agreement:\n\nsetting land ceilings at a maximum of 5000 sq. meters for residential land, 2000 sq. meters for commercial land and 4000 sq. meters for industrial land;\n\nthe introduction of sectional titles to enable construction of flats in urban areas23.\n\nIn 2011 the Lesotho Land Administration Authority was established responsible for the cadastre, deeds and survey. Their focus was improving customer service delivery while overseeing the mass registration of leases – a function subcontracted to appointed service providers. Through a complex process involving multiple international subcontractors, a lease registry was created containing 92% of all leases in the Maseru urban area and a cadastral map prepared for Maseru24.\n\nThe passing of the Act altered the balance between the authority of chiefs, bureaucrats and elected officials. However, there are different perspectives on the extent that it ensured bureaucratic accountability. In the urban areas there are accounts25 of pressure being put on people with access to agricultural land to sell their fields so that the land could be rezoned for development in what has been described as a ‘small scale land’ grab by local elites26. It is difficult to assess from available evidence the extent to which this elite capture was common practice.\n\nLand tenure classifications\n\nAs noted above, people in rural settings could obtain land certificates via Land Allocation Committees which confer the rights to use, occupy and bequeath the land, but not to alienate it. However, there was little demand from rural land occupiers for these allocation certificates.\n\nIn the urban areas land allocation by chiefs has largely been replaced by a system of leasehold titling. “The vast majority of these leases are either individual or joint leases, and they are alienable and freely exchangeable”27. Lease durations ranged from 90 years for residential land to 60 and 40 years for industrial and commercial purposes28.\n\nIt is also possible to apply for a short-term licence to access agricultural land within legally gazetted urban boundaries. These licences could be terminated on three months’ notice, without compensation29.\n\nLand use trends\n\nLesotho is a key water source for the industrial heartlands in South Africa through the multibillion bi-national Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Ordinarily, the LHWP initiated in 1986 supplies between 60- 70% of water to Gauteng. However, climate change related drought and reduced winter snowfalls on the mountains have reduced water availability dramatically.\n\nOverall, 76.1% of Lesotho’s land can be characterised as agricultural, of which between 10 and 11% is arable. The mountainous terrain means that much land is located on steep slopes and inaccessible. Very little land is forested - in the region of 1.5%. Lesotho is regarded to be highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and is prone to severe droughts, frost and flooding. There are significant concerns about environmental degradation and soil erosion impacting on catchments and watersheds. In the mountain common grazing land – “owned, used and administered through community institutions with reasonably well-distributed benefits - has become an open access terrain delivering reduced benefits to fewer people in a context of continuing environmental degradation”30.\n\nAnnual depletion of natural resources is estimated at 4.6% of Gross National Income31. The contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined from 20% in 1980 to around 6% in 201732.\n\nLesotho goats, photo by H. Beisner, originally published in Pixabay, CC0\n\nLand investments and acquisitions\n\nA 2014 UNCTAD Investment Review notes that there is a local partnership requirement of 20% for foreign investors seeking to access direct lease titles from the Government applies to all economic sectors. According to UNCTAD this “constitutes a deterrent to investment in a country where access to land remains a primary bottleneck in the investment environment. It is telling that no foreign investor to date has requested land title under the conditions set out in the new law”33.\n\nHowever contrary to this view it has been argued that “thirty year leases did not inhibit Korean and Taiwanese investment in building factories in Lesotho to take advantage of the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Further it has been argued that leasehold enabled these investors “to walk away from Lesotho overnight when the U.S. changed its rules on the permitted origins of foreign clothing entering the country. This left empty factories and accelerated unemployment”34.\n\nWhile it is correct that investors pulled out abruptly when the AGOA rules changed it is debatable whether restrictions on the rights of foreigners to own land has ever constituted a real disincentive for investment. In the 1980’s first Lesotho attracted South African textile investors seeking to sidestep global sanctions by providing “favourable rentals on preconstructed factory shells…and a five year tax holiday”. Taiwan had been one of the few countries to maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa and had operated textile factories in South African homelands before relocating these operations to Lesotho.\n\nThe single largest investment in the country’s history – the Lesotho Highlands Water Scheme has had major impacts on the livelihoods of those who were living in the area and displaced by construction of the Katse dam. This is discussed further below in the community land rights section.\n\nLand Matrix records three land related investments in Lesotho all of which relate to mining. While these do not involve large areas of land – just 210 ha they involve valuable mineral resource rights including the world’s third largest undeveloped kimberlite resource35.\n\nWomen’s land rights\n\nFollowing the failure to implement recommendations contained in the 1987 Land Policy Review Commission, the World Bank and bilateral donors actively intervened to influence land policy. They sought to enable women to access land rights and create an urban land market as a precondition for investment.\n\nMarried women were legally considered minors until 2006 when the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act enabled women to have full citizenship rights and own property in their own right36. While the 2010 Act altered the relationship between land and gender in Lesotho, this did not necessarily result in increased ability of women to benefit from access to land in rural settings37.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that the Land Act significantly improved women’s land rights security in urban areas. For example “the Land Act contained a provision for presumption of joint title in marriages and therefore every lease issued in the regularisation project named both spouses”38. This was non-negotiable, and reportedly very few men resisted this stipulation. Of the new land leases issued in terms of the Act 12% were issued to men, 34% to women and 52% issued to married couples jointly39. In this way the Land Act has also protected women’s inheritance rights.\n\nUrban tenure issues\n\nA Town and Country Planning Act was passed in 1980, primarily to regulate allocation of land in urban areas along with a Valuation and Ratings Act. Again this was intended to end the allocation of urban land by chiefs in terms of customary tenure norms40. These laws struggled to gain traction due to lack of state capacity which was partly addressed following the passing of the Urban Government Act of 1983 and the Local Government Act of 1987. However, in practice rents and rates went largely uncollected.\n\nRapid urbanisation with the quadrupling of the of the urban population between 1976 and 2006 provided the main impetus for leasehold land titling41. There remain important questions about how the urban is defined in planning law, as much of the population increase is located in areas on the fringes of demarcated urban settlements “where agricultural land is informally subdivided into plots for sale under the hand of customary authorities”42.\n\nOverall urban governance has been characterised as weak and ineffectual. This has implications for urban land management. The Maseru City Council was established in 1993 following pressure by the World Bank which threatened to withdraw funding for urban site and service schemes in Lesotho. In 2012 it was stated that 70% of the population continued to access land by informal means – both wealthy and poor households43. UN Habitat reports that 7% of owners have bought their urban stand from a private individual or firm, while 67% have had the land allocated by chiefs and 20% have inherited it. This has meant that the formal property market in Lesotho has remained largely undeveloped.\n\nIn the 1990’s Lesotho experienced accelerated urbanisation. This followed the loss of 50% of South African mining jobs between 1989 and 2001, while new work opportunities for women in a recently established textile sector encouraged rural-urban migration44. By 1996 30% of the population had moved to town, mostly to the capital Maseru. However, their land rights were insecure. Legal uncertainties and lack of institutional capacity in government meant that chiefs continued to allocate land in peri-urban areas while the city planners in Maseru and elsewhere struggled to deliver water and sanitation services. In urban areas continuing legal dualism made it increasingly difficult to plan for a rapidly growing city.\n\nThe Land Act of 2010 sought in part to address this and was accompanied by a process to regularise title in the urban areas. Landholders were requested to submit claims to their land with whatever evidence they had. If after 30 days, there were no objections to a claim a presumption was made that the claim is valid. In some instances surveyors were sent to villages to survey land held by confirmed rights holders to record their leases. Once this process was complete in the Selected Development Areas, there were moves to purchase land from registered lease holders for housing development, commercial precincts and golf courses. Research highlights how registered rights holders were pressured by developers and the municipal officials to sell off agricultural land45. There is evidence that some of those who were reluctant to sell were informally threatened with expropriation where compensation would be paid at a reduced rate46.\n\nCommunity land rights issues\n\nThe 2010 Land Act was silent on tenure security rights with regard to rural land held in common such as communal rangelands. It has been argued that this renders rural communities vulnerable to appropriation by wealthy individuals or corporate interests who could acquire land directly through the state47.\n\nLand pressure countrywide has led to decreasing plot sizes as family land allocations are subdivided between children. This pressure has created tension between competing needs between land for housing and land for stock and crop farmers48. At the same time agriculture is in decline. In 2010 only 8% of households were reported to sell any agricultural produce49.\n\nThe massive Lesotho Highlands Water Project impacted on the land, livelihoods and housing of some 27 000 – 30 000 people, requiring relocations and programmes of compensation. Arable and grazing land were submerged reducing livelihood opportunities and impacting on livestock health. An instream flow reduction study estimated that a further 155 000 people would be impacted by changes in river flows downstream from the main dams50. These impacts are of particular significance as poverty levels are highest in the mountains and the Senqu River valley and have increased by 10% between 2002 and 201851.\n\nLesotho roadavals, originally published in Pixabay, CC0\n\nVoluntary Guidelines on Responsible Tenure (VGGT)\n\nThe UN Voluntary Guidelines52 represents a political agreement and a ‘soft law’ representing “global consensus on a set of norms”53 for the governance of the tenure of land, fisheries and forests in support of the progressive realisation of the right to food”. The VGGT has elevated tenure over land and natural resources to a human rights issue. However there remain questions about VGGT and the extent to which “the socially progressive language of “respect for land rights” and “tenure security” are in practice advancing instrumentalities which are equally likely to pry open as to safeguard communal land in the face of outside interests”.\n\nA recent review of Section 16 of (VGGTs) scores Lesotho’s land legislation as a C – where the laws do not adopt the VGGT principle. Section 16 focuses on legal provisions with regards to expropriation, compensation and resettlement. This follows a review of a “broad range of legally binding instruments, including national constitutions, land acquisition acts, land acts, communal land acts, agricultural land acts, land use acts, and regulations”54. This rating reflects an assessment of land law but it can also be regarded as an indicator of the state of land governance in Lesotho. Despite this finding there is evidence that the Land Act did much to improve land governance in urban areas. However, in rural areas chiefs continue to play a role in land governance and their land governance functions remain subject to limited effective oversight.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe various measures to shape land policy and develop law must be set against a backdrop of continued political instability in Lesotho. Corruption and maladministration continue to be a constraint in Lesotho at a societal level, although there are indicators suggesting improved service provision by the Land Administration Authority. Despite this, where land transactions are concerned many landowners and users may fall back on “emergent market mechanisms that are only partially legitimated and regulated by the official system”. Formal and the informal land access mechanisms continue to operate side by side.\n\nTimeline: Milestones in land governance\n\n1868 Basutoland declared a British Protectorate\n\n1903 Promulgation of customary law legal code\n\n1966 The Kingdom of Lesotho obtains independence from the British.

Back in 1994 anthropologist James Ferguson wrote a much- quoted critique of development aid entitled ‘The anti-politics machine: “Development” and bureaucratic power in Lesotho’ which remains important reading. Clement Leduka has published wide-ranging research on Lesotho with an important focus on informal land delivery processes and access to housing. Jonathan Crush has done important work on migration and food security across the Southern African region which includes a focus on Lesotho.\n\nThe companion Detailed Timeline: Lesotho provides a chronology of key historical events and linked land related issues."
