        "text": "Although the overall analysis of the citations received by Nobel laureates in the scientific background of their Nobel Prize gives an overview of how and when Nobel-awarded discoveries have been achieved and published, it will be interesting to consider the number of mentions of each work co-authored by a Nobel winner in his Nobel Prize scientific background, the works co-authored by Nobel laureates and listed in Further Reading section of Nobel Prize scientific background, the author rank of Nobel laureates in papers cited in Nobel Prize scientific background and the citation and co-citation networks of the research works of Nobel winners to give in-depth explanations of the dynamics of Nobel Prize discoveries.\n\nMedical physics is a rapidly developing, technologically dependent field. New discoveries are being made almost daily, as demonstrated by papers in this and other similar journals. Many of the authors are early in their careers. Some are concerned, however, that more famous medical physicists often get credit for discoveries due to their fame rather than less prominent scientists who may have, in fact, contributed more to the development in question.\n\nThe impact factor (IF) of scientific journals has acquired a major role in the evaluations of the output of scholars, departments and whole institutions. Typically papers appearing in journals with large values of the IF receive a high weight in such evaluations. However, at the end of the day one is interested in assessing the impact of individuals, rather than papers. Here we introduce Author Impact Factor (AIF), which is the extension of the IF to authors. The AIF of an author A in year t is the average number of citations given by papers published in year t to papers published by A in a period of Î”t years before year t. Due to its intrinsic dynamic character, AIF is capable to capture trends and variations of the impact of the scientific output of scholars in time, unlike the h-index, which is a growing measure taking into account the whole career path."
