        "text": "Although the first description of chromosomes of Arabidopsis dates as far back as 1907, little attention was paid to its cytogenetics for a long time. The spectacular interest in chromosome research for this species that now is the model plant species by excellence came with the introduction of molecular cytogenetical research including FISH technology, genome sequence data and immunodetection of chromatin proteins. In this paper, we present an overview of the most important cytogenetic tools that were developed for Arabidopsis in recent decades. It shows the power of meiosis for studying synaptic mutants and FISH technology, and the development of numerical and structural chromosome mutant series like trisomics, telotrisomics and translocations for assigning linkage groups to chromosomes. Its small genome and chromosome size and relatively simple organization of heterochromatin have been the key to a successful characterization of the molecular organization of repetitive and single...\n\nIn the next 20 years, the world population is expected to reach a total of 8.3 billion people. Agriculture will have to produce sufficient food knowing that presently and globally agricultural production nearly matches world consumption. Yet, malnutrition is not only a matter of food amount but also concerns food nutritional quality. In particular, the nutritional value and quality of seeds should be improved to alleviate malnutrition and provide a well-balance diet. Progress in seed biology has considerably benefited from the rise in the last decade of the two model plants Arabidopsis and rice. Along with their genome sequences obtained respectively in 2000 for Arabidopsis and in 2005 for rice, functional genomics became possible because of the rapid development of their mutant libraries, full-length cDNA libraries, stock centers, web-accessible databases, and information portals, such as TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource). Then, the development of high-throughput technological breakthroughs (e.g. DNA and protein array, mass spectrometry) helped to survey the omics state (transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome) of seeds at different developmental and environmental conditions. These approaches fuel candidate genes for seed quality (composition, germination vigor and capacity, good resistance to stress, etc.) that can be confirmed using functional genomics resources. Finally, exploitation of the confirmed candidate genes by plant breeders should improve seed nutritional quality and yield. In this chapter, we discuss how global “omics” technologies can help to find new candidate genes relevant for improvement of seed nutritional quality. Examples of omics application in unraveling the rice seed biology are particularly discussed.\n\nThe co mutation of Arabidopsis thaliana causes a late-flowering phenotype that is insensitive to day-ength. The mutation was mapped previously to the upper arm of chromosome 5, approximately 1.6 cM from the chalcone synthase gene (CHS). We were provided with five yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) libraries and used these to perform a chromosome walk from CHS to the CO gene. In this paper we report the isolation of 1700 kb of contiguous Arabidopsis DNA, which represents approximately 1%–2% of the genome, inserted in YACs. This required the detailed analysis of 67 YACs, from which 87 end probes were isolated and examined in hybridisation experiments. This analysis showed that approximately 40% of the YACs presented problems in chromosome walking experiments because they contained repetitive sequence at one of their termini, were chimaeric or because part of the plant DNA was deleted. DNA fragments isolated from YACs were used as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to localize CO to a 300 kb region within the cloned DNA. We compare the physical distance between CHS and CO with the genetic distance and find that in this region 1 cM is equivalent to approximately 200 kb."
