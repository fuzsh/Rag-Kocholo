        "text": "1 Growth of Plants and Preservation of Seeds Randy Scholl, Luz Rivero-Lepinckas,\n\nand Deborah Crist\n\n1. Introduction Arabidopsis can be grown in a variety of environmental settings including growth rooms, wmdow ledges, outdoors, growth chambers, and greenhouses. The growth media that can be employed include soil, commercial greenhouse mixes, vermrcuhte, and other relatively inert media watered wtth nutrient solutions, as well as agar. This chapter focuses on growth of plants on so11 in various envrromnental settings and especrally m growth chambers and greenhouses. Harvestmg, seed quaky, and seed preservation are also considered. Whereas Arubidopszs IS adaptable, it 1s not the equivalent of a house plant in that a number of environmental factors must be carefully controlled, or the culture may result m very unhealthy plants and even total failure. One of the main objectives of this chapter 1s to indrcate which conditions are critical to healthy plant growth and development and to high quality and quanttty of seeds.

Mixtures of soil, which have substantial peat moss, can be used successfully. Inert substratessuch as vermiculite can also be utilized if nutrients are supplied in the watering solution. These are useful for nutritional studies. Peat-based commercial mixes represent a convenient and reliable base for growing plants. Mixes such as Metromix 350 support healthy Arabzdopsis growth and have fertthzer added, so that fertilization is not necessaryin the early growth phases. Seedscan be planted m various ways However, strict control of numbers of seedsplanted is maintained, and separate rows of different lines can be planted in the same pot for critical comparisons with the technique described here. Preparation of pots and planting can be accomplished as follows: 1 Autoclave sot1 in covered steel pan for at least 30 mm to kill any pests Approximately fifteen IO-cm pots can be tilled from 25 L of soil. 2 Thoroughly wet sot1 wtth tap water or nutrient solution MIX well wtth trowel or large spoon 3 Place sol1 m pots The surface of the sot1 should be approx 1 cm below the top of the pot. Pots are ready for planting (see Note 1) 4 Draw out the end of a long Pasteur pipet to a pomt over a bunsen burner as follows Grasp the wade end of the ptpet with one hand and use tweezers to hold the narrow end Concentrate the flame approx 2 cm from the narrow end of the ptpet When the glass begins to soften, pull the two ends apart unttl a constrrctron has been created. Allow the pipet to cool. Then, hold the constricted area of the modtfied ptpet mstde several layers of paper towel and break It so that the resulting opening srze IS shghtly larger than an Arabzdopsls seed This requtres trtal and error as well as care to avotd injury Place a latex bulb on the upper end of the modttied Pasteur ptpet 5 Submerge the seeds to be planted m a watch glass, or other dish, wtth water (preferably dtsttlled) 6. Exhaust air from the ptpet, submerge its tip, and use slow release pressure on the bulb to suck a single seed mto the end of the ptpet The seed can be transferred to the pot and dropped at the desired locatton by careful exhausting of the pipet. Be careful not to draw seeds beyond 1-2 cm into the pipet Make certain that seeds are not planted below the soil surface. Repeated pipetings are used for the remamder of the seeds (see Note 2) 7. Cover pots wtth clear plastrc wrap, and cut several small slits m the plastic with a kmfe (see Note 3) Place pots in the refrigerator for at least 2 d (see Note 4). 8 After cold treatment, place pots m growth area. Remove plastic wrap and maintain approx 2 cm of water around base of pots during the germination phase (4-6 d) Leave plasttc wrap on for plants grown m growth chamber and do not add additional water.\n\n3.1.2. Care of Plants During Growth The rate of development, time to flowering, and time to harvest of Arabidopsis depend on several factors besides the genetic background:\n\nScholl, Rivero-Lepinckas,\n\n4\n\nand Crist\n\n1 Light (plants flower rapldly under contmuouslight or long days,whereasunder short days,flowering 1sprevented or delayed). 2. Temperature (lower temperatures slow the growth, favoring the vegetative phase). 3 Nutrition (poor nutrition can lead to rapid flowermg, shortenedgrowth period, and low seedset) Under contmuous light, 25”C, adequate watering, and good nutrition, seeds of the commonly used ecotype Columbia germinate 3-5 d after planting. They form rosettes, bolt, and flower within 34 wk and can be harvested within 8 wk. Management of light, temperature, water, and nutrition during the growth of plants will ensure that healthy plants develop that produce high quality and quantity of seeds.The effect of each factor is discussed separately. 3.1.2.1.\n\nLIGHT\n\nOptimum light 1sapprox 150 @/m2/s. Cool white or very high output (VHO or SHO) fluorescent lamps supplemented by incandescent lighting are used for growth chambers. Higher light intensity, up to full sun, is tolerated by older plants, although the use of 60% shade cloth m summer greenhouses helps wtth light intensity control and temperature regulation. Supplemental evening and morning light 1sprovtded m the greenhouse during winter since the plants generally require a long photoperlod (at least 12 h) for flowering. Continuous light 1swell tolerated and can be used to accelerate the reproductive cycle. Photoperlods of 16 h work well for greenhouse growth. 3.1.2.2\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\nThe optimum growth temperature for ArubidopszsIS25°C. Lower temperatures are permissible, but higher temperatures are not recommended for germination through early rosette development. Older plants tolerate higher temperatures, at least up to 3O”C, but maintenance of 25°C 1snevertheless desirable for the entire growth period. Growth chambers can be set at 25°C when used for seed production. It 1s advisable to set the greenhouse temperature at 23°C unless temperature control IS exceptionally good, so that the temperature fluctuations do not causeproblems. It 1srecommended that night temperatures be maintained 24°C lower than the day temperature. 3.1.2.3.\n\nWATERING AND HUMIDITY\n\nAfter germination, plants are watered as needed to avoid water stress. Water is best applied by subirrigation for the first few weeks and only when the so11 begins to dry. Overwatering should be avoided due to the potential for algal or fungal growth on the soil surface (see Note 5). Overwatermg of greenhouse plants also provides favorable sol1 conditions for fungus gnat larvae. More\n\nPlant Growth and Seed Preservation\n\n5\n\nfrequent watering may be necessary durmg the first few days, as it is necessary to avoid any drying before the first two true leaves begin expandmg. After plants have developed true leaves, watering frequency may be reduced to as low as once or twice per week until the plants flower. The water requirement of plants increases dramatically during silique filling. Daily watering at thts stage is necessary for good seed productton. Water requirement is strongly influenced by relative humidity. Arabidopsis plants, including seedlings, tolerate low humidity although Increased humidity (e.g., 50-60%) greatly reduces the risk of accidental drying of the soil surface and subsequent desiccation of the fragile, germinating seedlings. Rosette-stage plants thrive at a wide range of humidities. For optimal seed quality, lower humidities (~50%) are desirable when siliques begin to mature. 3 1.2 4. FERTILIZATION Mild mineral nutrient solution can be applied to pots at 2-wk intervals. Thts solution can also be mixed with the soil when it is initially prepared. Fertilization is not absolutely required during the growth phase for seed production if the initial soil mix is well fertilized. However, the addition of nutrients in the later growth phases will increase seed set and result in healthier plants. Preparation and application of the fertilizer solution described in Subheading 2. has worked well for seed production (see Note 6) at the Arabzdopszs Biological Resource Center (ABRC). This solution was adapted from Estelle and Somerville (2). 3.1.3. Harvesting The avoidance of seed mixing among adjacently growing lines, loss of seeds owing to shattering, and assurance of the quality of the harvested seeds are goals that pose some specific challenges. Various means and devices can be employed to achieve these Watermg of pots should be discontinued several days prior to harvest so that pots are dry when harvest is conducted. It should be noted that delays m harvestmg following physiological maturation of the plant result in seed deterioration, especially under nonoptimal environmental conditions. Several seed collection strategies are compared m the following. 3.1.3.1.\n\nBULK PRODUCTION ON THE OPEN BENCH\n\nFor bulk seed production, the best method is to simply grow the plants on the open bench, keep all accessions separated by adequate space, avoid disturbance of maturing inflorescences, and harvest when all stliques are dry. The entire inflorescence IS cut off at its base and carefully placed into an approx 4-L transparent plastic bag. This is compatible with the goals of high seed quality, maximum seed yield, and good pest protection. Some seeds may be\n\nScholl, Rivero-Lepinckas,\n\n6\n\nand Crist\n\nlost, but the remamder are almost always healthy, and result in vigorously germinating seedlings. After harvest, the entire contents of the bag are allowed to dry m preparation for threshing. 3.1.3.2.\n\nEARLY HARVEST OF INDIVIDUAL SILIQUES\n\nSeedsfrom mdivtdual sihques can be harvested after the sthques have turned completely yellow, if rapid turnover is required. However, such seedsdo have htgh levels of germmatton Inhibitors. For normal seed production, seeds are harvested only after the sihques have completely browned, and if pressed with fingers, do not compress (if the silique has dried even further, the srhque will shatter at this point). At this stage, seedsare completely formed. Since formation and maturation of sihques occur over time, early srliques can be harvested before later ones mature to avotd seed loss. However, tt ts usually recommended to wait until the enttre mflorescence has browned before harvest. 3.1 3 3 COMMERCIAL SEED COLLECTORS\n\nAraconsTM (Lehle Seed Co, Round Rock, TX) (3) are effective for singleplant harvesting, preventmg cross pollmation, and seed contammatton, but are not necessary when simple bulk production is desrred. Harvestmg from Aracons (after pots have been allowed to dry) 1saccomphshed easily by carefully cutting off the mflorescence under the devtce, placing the Aracon plus contents carefully into a large plastic bag (approx 4 L), removing the plant material from the plastic tube, and then shaking the seeds mto the bag. 3.1.3 4. BAGGING INFLORESCENCES BY POT\n\nInflorescences of non-erectu lines can simply be tramed into an approx 4 L transparent plastic bag before any sihques begin to brown. The bag, however, may potentially collect moisture from transpiration or careless watering and provides a haven for insects when greenhouses are sprayed. To reduce these possibilities, the bag should be kept widely open at all times. Wait until the mflorescence has browned before harvesting. Thts method is conducive to strict isolation of the lines, and the bag serves to collect shattered seeds.Harvesting 1s accomplished by carefully cutting the entire inflorescence off at its base after all seeds have matured and shaking the seedsinto the plastic bag.\n\n3.2. Postharvest Handling and Preservation of Seeds The longevity of seedscan be affected by: genotype; pre-storage environment, such as condttrons during seed maturation, harvesting, and seed handling; and seed storage condrtrons. The genotype and prestorage conditions are important because they determme the maximum potential for seed longevrty. Our experi-\n\nPlant Growth and Seed Preservation\n\n7\n\nence regarding effect of genotype IS limited, although rapld deterioration of seeds has not been observed for the diverse collections currently maintained at ABRC. The abscisic acid mutants are one possible exceptlon. A slow processof deterloratlon begins as soon as seedsmature on aplant. Therefore, the sooner seedsare placed mto storage,the better. Harvested seedsshould be processedpromptly (mcludmg threshing, cleaning, drymg and packagmg) and then placed mto storage. The followmg procedures form a sequence that ensures that the seedswill be conserved m the best possible condition. 3.2.1. Threshing and Cleanmg The harvested plant material should be allowed to dry for a few days m the opened plastic bag before threshing, since threshing 1s easier when the inflorescences are dry. Seeds should be threshed when the moisture content is approx 1O%, to minimize seed damage during threshing. This moisture content will be reached when all material m the bag appears to be dry. The plastic bags containing dried inflorescences can be gently hand-pressed from the outside, and the seeds will fall to the bottom of the bag (see Note 7). Most of the dry inflorescence can be removed from the bag by hand before seeds are sieved to separate them from chaff. Hand sieves with graded mesh sizes are recommended to remove large and small debris. Small, shrunken, and immature seeds are returned to the bulk, particularly for accessions which are genetically heterogeneous. After sieving, the seedsare still likely to be mixed with sol1 and residue. A combination of additional sievmg, blowing, and visual inspection can be employed to clean the seeds completely Small samples can be cleaned by hand with the aid of a pointed tool on an opaque glass plate illuminated from below. Cleaned seed samples are placed in open, carefully labeled glass jars (do not use plastic because of static effects) to allow seeds to dry. 3.2.2. Seed Drying The moisture content of Arubidopsis seedsafter threshing is usually approx 10%. The seeds should be dried to 545% moisture, prior to storage. Higher moisture content can cause seed deterioration. There are many methods available for drying seeds. The safest method 1sto air-dry the seeds at room temperature for l-3 wk (see Note 8). Low relative humidity 1snecessary for seeds to reach the desired storage levels. The lower the humidity, the faster the seeds will dry, and the lower their final moisture content. If after testing, the moisture content is not low enough, continue to dry further and check again. 3.2.3. Seed Moisture Con tent Determination Moisture testing is necessary to verify that seedsare dry enough for storage. Seed moisture content can be determined by several methods. The following\n\nScholl, Rivero-Lepinckas,\n\n8\n\nand Crist\n\nmethod outlined is a destructwe method, and the seedsemployed for testing will no longer beviable. This IS a “modified low constant temperature oven” method. Preheat oven to lOO--105°C (see Note 9) Accurately weigh one clean, numbered dish and its cover to four decimal places usmg an analytical balance. Record the weight (W 1, see Note 10) Add approx 100 or 200 mg of seeds distributed evenly over the base of the dish, replace the cover, and accurately weigh the dish and cover. Record this weight (W2) Place the dish m a safe place, and continue to prepare the second and/or thud replicates m the same way. When all samples have been weighed mto numbered dishes, place each dish on top of its numbered lid m the oven Heat the samples for 15-17 h. Remove the dishes from the oven, replace their covers and Immediately place m a desiccator at room temperature to cool for 30-45 mm After heatmg, the dishes must be placed directly mto the desiccator so that the dry seeds do not absorb any moisture 7. Remove the dishes one by one from the desiccator, immediately weigh each dish and cover, and record the weight (W3). Do not leave the desiccator open durmg the welghtmgs. 8 Moisture content 1s calculated as the percentage loss m weight of the orlgmal weight of seeds This IS known as wet- or fresh-weight basis, and IS expressed to one decimal place Algebralcally, if W 1 IS the weight of the dish, W2 the weight of dish and seed before drymg, and W3 the weight of dish and seed after drying, then % Moisture Content = (W2 - W3)/(W2 - W 1) x 100\n\n3.2.4. Seed Packaging for Storage After seed moisture content ts within the safe storage limits, dried seeds should be placed in tightly sealed,impermeable contamersto prevent rehydratlon. There are many containers\n\nand equipment\n\nfor storing plant seeds. Cryovlals\n\nwith volume markings are convenient. They hold large numbers of seeds, seal tightly,\n\nand can be resealed many times.\n\nIn packaging seeds,each contamer should be labeled with relevant information including date of storage using a waterproof permanent marker. In determining seed quantities, approximately 1250 seeds = 25 mg = 50 & Seal the container immediately after filling, and visually check. During storage, check the containers at regular intervals to assure that they remam m good condltlon. 3.25. Seed Storage and Preservation The major factors influencing seed longevity are storage temperature and seed moisture content. The higher the value of either, the shorter the lifespan of the seeds.Seedsleft at ambient temperature and relative humidity lose vlablllty relatively\n\nquickly.\n\nThe conditions\n\nwhich prolong viability\n\nduring storage have\n\nPlant Growth and Seed Preservation\n\n9\n\nbeen well defined for plant seeds (46). Seed storage principles for Arabidopszsare stmilar to those for other plants. For active collections in which seeds are stored for short to medium terms and are accessed often, a convenient storage temperature is approx 4°C (regular refrigerator temperature). For base collections m which seedsare placed m long-term storage without disturbance, a temperature of -20°C is appropriate Storage of vials in larger containers with desiccant or placement of gelatin capsules with desiccant m the storage vials are also possible. However, if vials are sealed tightly and not opened cold, these measures should not be necessary. The arrangements of vials m storage can vary, but it is important to record the exact locatton of each accession.Codes Indicating boxes, racks, trays, freezers, and so on, can be used. Removal of vials from storage represents a potentially very dangerous step. Vials must be warmed to room temperature before openmg. Rapid rewarming (placing vial m a 37°C water bath for approx 10 mm) serves to minimize freeze/ frost damage that can occur during this process. Working in a low relative humidtty environment, if possible, also aids in preventton of hydration. If it is suspected that condensation has occurred in a vial during storage or opening, the vial should be left open m a dry location until seeds have desiccated before returning them to cold storage 3.2.6. Seed Viability and Testing Seed viability is the condition in which seeds are alive, have the potential to germinate, and develop mto normal, reproducttvely mature plants, given the appropriate conditions. Factors that affect viability include the initral viability of the seeds at the start of the storage, seed moisture content, and storage environment Viability should be monitored at regular intervals (7,8). It is anttcipated that viability of Arabidopsis seeds should remam high for long storage periods, assuming proper condittons. The International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) recommends that seeds in long-term storage under the optimal preservatton standards should be monitored at least every 10 yr. Seeds m long-term storage with either poor storage life or poor mtttal vtability and seeds m short to medium-term storage should be momtored at least every 5 yr. A viability test for Arabidopsis seedscan be conducted in 3-6 d. Tests should be carrred out before seeds are packaged and stored, so that poor quality seeds can be recognized. A germination test is the best method of estimating seed viability. Arabzdopszs seedsmay fail to germinate because they are dormant or because they are dead. Dormant seeds typically remain firm and m good condition during the germination test, whereas dead seeds soften and are\n\nattackedby fungi. Dormancy can usually be broken by imbibing seedsat low temperatures (see Note 4). The followmg method is suitable for Arabzdopsls:\n\n10\n\nScholl, Rivero-Lepinckas,\n\nand Crist\n\n1 Place two layers of filter paper (free from chemical residues that could Interfere with the germination of the seeds) firmly m the bottom of a labeled 9-cm diameter Petri dish. 2. Moisten the paper with distilled water. The paper should be totally saturated, but no excess water should be left m the dish. 3. Distribute 100 seeds umformly on the surface of the paper Replace the lid and seal the dish with parafilm or clear tape, to preclude desiccation 4. Cold treat seeds by placing Petri dishes m the refrigerator for 2-4 d. 5 Place the dishes on an illummated shelf (or in a growth chamber) under standard light and temperature conditions (see Note 11) 6 After 3-6 d count germinated vs ungermmated seeds, and record germmation percentage 4.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Prepared pots can be stored in deep, covered pans for several days before planting, although pot preparation and planting should be conducted on the same day if possible. 2. Seeds can be planted by various methods dependmg on the purpose of the plants and availabihty of seeds. Simple scattering of seeds from a folded ptece of paper works well for relatively dense populations and when some vanatton of density can be tolerated. The density of planting depends on the genetic material and the purpose of the plantmg For seed production, high yields are achieved utihzmg densities of 1O-20 plants/lo-cm pot Larger populations do not necessarily reduce yield, but production per plant is reduced mversely. Larger populations are necessary for maintenance of representative proportions in a segregating population, and this can be achieved with more dense plantings in one or two 1O-cm pots. Planted seeds should not be covered with additional soil; Arabzdopszs seeds need light for germination 3 If several pots are planted, they can be placed in a tub or other similar container and covered with clear plastic wrap In all cases, the plastic wrap should not be allowed to contact the soil surface The wrap IS perforated m order to provide some aeration. However m the greenhouse, this method can overheat the soil surface and kill the germinating seedlmgs. In this case, the pots are left uncovered and placed m pans filled wrth l-3 cm of water, which is maintained contmually until all plants germmate and have expanded cotyledons. 4. The use of a cold treatment (24°C for 2-4 d) to break dormancy is very important for plantings uttlizing freshly harvested seeds, which have more pronounced dormancy. Most widely used strains have moderate dormancy, and cold treatment may not be required when planting older seeds of these accessions For certam accessions, as many as 7 d of cold treatment is necessary Cold treatment of dry seeds is usually not effective m breaking dormancy. 5 If algae cover the soil as a result of overwatermg of young plants, the pots should be allowed to dry, which will kill algae before the plants become stressed The algae can then be carefully scraped from the soil surface, if necessary.\n\nP/ant Growth and Seed Preservation 6. Several mild commerctal fertilizers sold at plant stores for use with house plants also can be substttuted for the mineral solutton. Apply these m amounts and intervals according to the labels Timed-release fertthzers are a labor saving alternate fertilizer source Careful observation of the plants as they grow 1s effective m determinmg when fertihzer is needed Plants begin to get slightly lighter green as nutrients run out, and fertilizer should be applied immediately. Normal healthy plants are bright dark green m color 7. Hand rather than machme threshing and cleaning of the small Arabzdopsis seeds is recommended mamly because the threshmg machmes require rigorous cleaning between accessions to avoid sample cross-contammatton, requtre very careful adJustment, and do not accommodate the variable size ofArabrdopszs seeds well. 8 Since Arabzdopszs seeds equtltbrate to room condmons, it 1spossible to reliably predict the approximate moisture content of seeds stored m open contamers by simply measuring the room humtdity The relationshtp for Arabzdopszs 1ssimilar to others pubhshed for crop seeds having stmtlar chemical composmon (4). 9. High temperatures should not be used because the oil m the seeds may also vaporize and give false results Temperatures ofJust over 100°C evaporate water and mmimtze vaporization of oils. 10 Ltght-weight dishes should be used, so that the ratio of the weight of the seeds and the dish is not too disproporttonate. It is suggested that a mmtmum of three replicates of 100 mg of seedsor two rephcates of 200 mg of seedsper sample be used. Always work with care and fintsh one sample at a tune. Do not leave the dishes open m the laboratory between weighmgs because the seeds will absorb moisture raptdly from the air, and small changes m weights can result in large differences in the calculations. 11. Environmental condmons for seed germination tests are the same as for growing plants Two replicates of 100 seeds each provtde reliable germmation estimates Cases m which observed germination is < 80% may warrant follow-up testing to verify the low rate before it is accepted\n\nReferences 1.

Introduction One of the many reasons for the popularity of Arabidopszs as an experimental system IS the ease with which mutant screens can be carried out on Petrt plates under sterile conditions. Petri plate screenshave been successful for a number of reasons. First, large numbers of mutagenized seed can be easily scored for vartablllty, and secondly, plants m Petri plates can be grown constantly under completely defined condmons. These attributes open up the world of plant genetics to mutant screenssimilar to those described for micro-organisms For example, an Arubzdopm mutant insensitive to some particular compound such as a herbicide or growth regulator can be easily identified in a background of uniformly inhibited wild-type plants. The alternatives, spraying plants or n-rtgatmg so11with an inhibitor, not only result m problems of uniform application, but also are complicated by evaporation and catabohsm of the compound by other organisms. Aside from the ease of screening, Petri plate screensalso have the advantage that retesting and genetic analysts of subsequent generations can be done under exactly the same condmons as the original screen. Many different Petri plate screenshave been done with Arubidopsis, but the methods used fall roughly into three categories. The first, alluded to m the aforementioned paragraphs, mvolves the identification of mutants by their altered response to some compound that has been added to the growth medium. An example of this approach has been the isolation of mutants insensitive to various growth mhlbttors (e.g., chlorsulfuron) or phytohormones (Z-4). A second screening approach has been to identify mutants that show altered responses to specific environmental cues such as light or gravity (S-7). The third type of screen mcludes those m whtch the growth and development of the plant has been followed on Petri plates to identify mutant phenotypes that From Methods m Molecular Bfology, Vol 82 Arabldopsls Protocols Edited by J Martinez-Zapater and J Sahas 0 Humana Press Inc , Totowa,\n\n13\n\nNJ\n\nMcCourt\n\n14\n\nand Keith\n\nare normally difficult to observe in soil, for example, mutants with altered root morphology (8). In all of these cases,contmual growth and development under sterile conditions was an important factor m the successof the screens. 2. Materials 2.1.

If smaller amounts of seed are used, volumes and container size can be reduced. 1. Place up to 10,000 seeds (200 mg, anArabzdopszs seed weighs approx 0.02 mg) m a 50-n& Falcon tube and add approx 25 mL of sterlhzmg solution Vortex vigorously for 20-30 s or more as seeds are slightly hygroscoplc and tend to float. With enough mixing, the majority of seeds will disaggregate and smk to the bottom of the tube. 2 Let stand for 5-10 mm with occaslonal mixing. Draw off the liquid by aspiration and wash thoroughly with sterile distilled water five times (see Note 3) After each addition of water, mix the seeds vigorously and then draw off the water after the seeds settle.If the seedsdo not settlewell (somemutantsmay not), low speed centrlfigatlon for 10 s can be used to keep the seeds m the bottom of the tube\n\nduring aspiration Forthe lastaspiration,draw off the water to the level of the seeds 3 Add 3 mL of molten top agar (42OC) for every 500-1000 seed you wish to plate (e g., 10,000 seeds/30 mL) and Invert the tube to mix the seed (see Note 4)\n\nSterile Techniques in Arabidopsls\n\n15\n\n4. Using a 5-mL disposablepipe to draw up approx 3 mL and distribute it onto a Petri plate, swirl contents to distribute the seed, after the agar has sohdlfied (approx 5 mm) wrap them with gas-permeable tape (see Note 5)\n\n3.2, Transplantation of Plantlets from Petri Plates to Soil If desired, plants can be grown to seed under sterile conditions, however, yield is usually poor. Plants can be moved to larger containers such as culture tubes containing agar or plant cons. Culture tubes stoppered with cotton plugs or loosely fitting caps reduce the humidity, which increases seed set. If possible, it IS usually best to transplant seedlings to soil, m which the most healthy plants usually grow (see Note 6) 1 Drench sol1 m 0 5X MS so that the sol1 1s reasonably damp but not waterlogged (when you squeeze a handful of soil, little or no water drams out). Transplant no more than four plants/lo-cm pot, since mature plants will tangle and be difficult to harvest individually 2. Using forceps, pinch the hypocotyl very gently under the cotyledons and slowly remove the plantlet with the complete root from the agar. Put the root mto a small hole m the sol1 and cover the base of the plant with so11 3 Cover the pots with plastic wrap to keep the atmosphere moist so that the plants can acclimate 4 After 34 d, slit the wrap with a razor blade to decrease humidity, and after a week remove it completely\n\n3.3. Retesting\n\nMutants\n\n1. Prepare 12- or 24-well plates with agar for retests These plates can hold up to 2 mL/well of agar (see Note 7) 2 Sterilize 10-50 seeds from each line as described m 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL of sterlhzmg solution Seeds can be centrifuged after each wash to reduce their volume for asplratlon 3. After the last wash, resuspend seeds m 50-100 pL of a 0 1% agar solution, and using a P 1000 Pipetman plate (Nichlyro, Tokyo, Japan) , an appropriate amount of seed into each well (see Note 8) Plates should be sealed with gas-permeable tape (see Note 5)\n\n4. Notes 1 A simple way to make and storemedia is to weigh out separatelyenough 1X MS salts and 2X agar (1 6%) to make l-2 L of each solution and distribute them separate bottles of convenient sizes For example, put 100 mL of 1X MS 100 mL of 2X agar mto two, 250 mL bottles. Autoclave these for 20 mm store the sterile solutions on the shelf When plates are needed, melt\n\nmto and and the\n\nappropriate size bottle of 2X agar m a mlcrowave and add an equal amount of sterile 1X MS, which cools the solution and results in 1X agar m 0 5X MS salts.\n\n76\n\nMcCourt and Keith\n\nAdd 500 mMMES pH 5 7 (100X) stertle stock solutton to give a final concentration of 5 mM and pour the plates Ready-mixed MS salts powder can be purchased from Sigma (St Louts, MO). 0 8% Agar allows the removal of plantlets without damaging the roots Depending on the experiment being conducted, sucrose can be added as a carbon source (l-2%). Plants do grow more vigorously on sucrose containing media, but the risk of fungal contamination is much htgher. If sucrose is required, then plating of seeds should be done m a sterile hood However, for many screens, plants only need to germinate and grow for a short time and sucrose can be left out. Plants will grow autotrophically and set seeds if the light conditions are adequate (150-250 pE/m*/s) at room temperature and the container is big enough. The major cause of the contamination from seed lots IS the result of debris that IS carried along with the seed during harvestmg This material is difficult to sterilize and seed lots with large amounts of debris should be cleaned up as much as possible before sterilization The addition of Tween-20 to the sterilizing solution produces a soap sud interface after vortexmg which traps much of thus debris at the surface Then, debris can be removed with the aspirator after the seeds have settled and with each subsequent wash. For most screens, good distribution of seed on the Petri plate is essential so that each seedling or plant can be easily scored after germmation. The mixing of seeds with molten agar allows them to be dtstributed evenly over the plate m a similar fashion to plating lambda phage m top agar. After addition of molten agar to the seeds, the tube can be kept at 42“C for only about 15 mm. After this, they lose viability To increase the time m which to distribute the seeds, MS plates can be preheated for 20 mm at 37OC which slows the soltdtfication of the molten agar after plating. Plating 500-l 000 seeds/l 00 x 15 mm Petri plate allows easy scormg of seedlings up to a week old. If larger plants are required, fewer seeds should be plated or the plants will become overcrowded. Also, deep dish Petri plates (100 x 20 mm) can be used if larger plants are needed When the screen being conducted IS designed to inhibit wild-type growth, the seed can be plated at much higher densities The number of seeds/plate does affect the concentration of compound per seed, therefore when determining inhibitory concentratrons for screens using weld-type seeds, the condmons should be worked out using the same number of wild-type seeds/plate as used m the actual screen If the compound completely mhrbtts germination or is very toxrc early m germination, up to 10,000 seeds per Petrt plate can be used. It is also possible to use 150 x 15 mm Petri plates with 8 mL of top agar/plate. In many mhibltor screens, some sensitive plants appear normal based on seedling color and development, however, root development is usually retarded. By turning the plates over and scoring root growth mto the agar under a dissecting scope (1&20X), it is possible to discrimmate between true msensmve mutants and wild-type escapers. 5. Petri plates will dry out m many fan-driven incubators, especially plates on the edges of the incubator. Plates can be sealed with parafilm, but this inhibits gas\n\nSterile Techniques in Arabidopsis\n\n17\n\nexchange for the plants We have found gas-permeable surgical tape reduces drying, allows the plants to photosynthesize, and is impermeable to spores. 6 The time to remove plants after platmg depends on the type of screen, but generally the sooner you can get the plants to soil, the better the chance of recovery and growth 7 Retestmg usually mvolves large numbers of lines and IS best done on 12- or 24well plates with one well per mdividual M3 family. Not only does this save on solutions and space, but it also makes keeping track of various lines less tedious. 8. 0.1% Agar is viscous enough to allow the distribution of seeds mto small wells without clumping. When water is used, the seeds usually aggregate m a drop on top of the well.\n\nReferences 1 Bleeker, A B , Estelle, M A , Somerville, C., and Kende, H.

Introduction When growing Arabldopszs as an experimental orgamsm, the best standards of hygiene should be adopted to ensure uniform plant growth, representative populations are mamtamed for mapping analysis, and potentially useful new mutants are not lost m the early fragile stagesof screening. Arabidopszs 1sprone to many of the pests that commonly infect greenhouses and growthrooms (1,2). These can cause severe damage to the plants and, m some cases, can kill them. In general, the best philosophy to adopt m pest management is that of prevention rather than cure. 2. Pest Management It is advisable to adopt a strict regime for growing Arabidopszs so that infection can be minimized. Greenhouse/growthroom rules should be strictly enforced to ensure that even m communal growth areas these rules are observed. Measures should be m place to allow for the removal of material, to avoid experiments being put at risk by others’ sloppy practices. This kmd of strategy works best if someone ISput m charge of the area, such as a greenhouse manager, who can monitor the growth area and act appropriately. Before starting to grow Arabzdopsis, purge the greenhousearea or growthroom to remove all potential pathogens. If chronic infections develop later, it is advisable to throw out infected material, clean the greenhouse, and replant. Regardless of infection, thoroughly clean out the greenhouse area at least once a year, replacing gravel or capillary mattmg. Greenhouses should be cleaned more frequently if infection levels rise above an acceptable level.\n\nEdlted\n\nFrom Methods m Molecular Biology, Vol 82 Arabfdopsm by J Marttnez-Zapater and J Salmas 0 Humana Press\n\n19\n\nProtocols Inc , Totowa,\n\nNJ\n\nAnderson\n\n20 2.1. How to Maintain\n\nClean Growth Conditions\n\n1 Have greenhouse-specific laboratory coats that are laundered regularly. If plant material is kept m more than one greenhouse or growthroom, do not move between them m the same lab coat Beware, mfectton can be spread between growth areas on clothing. 2 Maintain footwipes at the entrance to the greenhouse which contain a general btoctde to prevent the movement of seed and potentral contaminants between greenhouses from the soles of shoes 3, Maintain screensover vents and windows to prevent the entry of flies, bees, and wasps 4 Employ fly strips as Insect traps to catch insects and give an indication of the type and level of mfectton 5. Always use fresh, clean compost mixes. Avoid leavmg bags of compost open, which can accumulate fhes’ eggs and fungal spores 6 Never move mfected material between greenhouses 7 Do not keep growth conditions over-wet, or over-dry. Either of these regimes can encourage infections. 8. Stake the matenal to prevent lodging. It will also reduce the chance of fungal infection. 9 Do not let old plant material accumulate m the waste bms as this can act as a reservoir for infection. 10. Do not have stagnant pools of water on the benches or on the floor 11. Regularly sweep the floors to remove plant debris. 12. If infection 1ssuspected, identify the source of infection and act accordingly.\n\n3. Arabidopsis\n\nPests and Diseases\n\nThe best way to mintmize infestatton of any kmd m the greenhouse or growthroom is to maintam good hygtenic practtce aslust outlined. However, tt is almost inevitable that at some time the greenhouse will become infected with some kmd of Arabzdopsis pest. The followmg sections list guidelmes on how to identify and treat the types of infection that effect Arabidopsis.\n\n3.7. Arabidopsis 3.1.1. Aphids\n\nPests\n\nAphids, also known as greenflies are small, sap feeding insects, which characteristtcally cluster on the stems of plants. Prtmary damage to the plant results from feeding on young tissues, which has the effect of distortmg and weakening new growth. In severe cases,plants can wilt and die. In addition, major infections can lead to the accumulation of honey dew on the stems and leaves which can encourage further infection from sooty molds. Aphid infestations can become overwhelmmg in a short period of time owing to the fact that most females are parthenogenetic and can give birth to live young, which mature in about a week. Prompt action 1stherefore required. Regularly inspect the plants for aphids and at the first sign of Infection apply treatment.\n\nControl of Arabtdopsls Pests and Diseases\n\n21\n\nInfections can stem from au-borne aphids. In the case of infection, check that screens are not damaged. Aphids can also be easily caught on clothing and introduced to the greenhouse or growthroom from the outside. Wearing a lab coat will help reduce the risk. To treat aphid mfectton, mmigate the greenhouse with 40% mcotme shreds (DowElanco, Httchins,Her&,,UK). Aphid infectionsin growthroomsaremoreproblematical.It may be necessaryto move the materialfrom the growthroomto anareawhere it can be fbmtgated.Alternatively, spraywith a proprietary systemicactioninsecttcide. 3.1.2. Red Spider Mite Red spider mite Infections can be very destructive and most often occur under dry and hot growth conditions. Infection is characterized by a silvery speckled effect on the leaves (Fig. 1A). In heavy infections, plants suffer yellow discoloration followed by wilting and slow death. The underside of the leaves have the appearance of being dusted with a white powder which is the result of the empty casesof the young mites and eggs which are suspended from thm white strands of silk (Fig. 1B). The mites can build webs along the flowermg stem and among the flowers. It is very easyto catch these silks on a lab coat and this can result in the transfer of eggs to other plants. Extreme caution should be observed. To treat for infection, fumigate with 40% nicotine shreds (DowElanco) maintaining a temperature of 25°C for at least 8 h or spray plants with Pentac Aquaflow (Dow Agriculture) or Savona (Koppert, Wadhurst, East Sussex,UK). 3.1.3. Sciarid Fly (Mushroom Fly or Fungus Gnat) Infection with sciarid fly is characterized by the plants lacking vigor and leaves turning yellow without the appearance of any visible damage above ground. Damage occurs through attack on the roots. Small white maggots can be observed among the root tissue where they feed, or moving through the soil. Small flies (gnats) gather around plant and are easily caught on fly strips. The main cause of infection with sciarid fly comes from eggs in the compost. Compost can be treated with insecticide (Basudin 5G granules [Ciba-Geigy, Whittlesford, Cambridge, UK]) or autoclaved to kill the eggs and larvae. Care should be taken in autoclaving since this can cause the production of nitrite compounds which are toxic to the plant. To treat sciarid fly infections, fumigate with Lindane smoke pellets (Octavms Hunt, Redfield, Bristol, UK) or mcotme 40% shreds (DowElanco) to eradicate flies and incorporate Basudin 5G granules (Ciba-Geigy) mto the compost to kill the larvae. Compost and benches may be drenched with a solution of diazinon liquid (Murphy Chemicals, St. Albana, Herts, UK), or Savona (Koppert), to eradicate the larvae. Alternatively biological control with Nemasys (Koppert) can work, but is not suitable for severe mfections.\n\nAnderson\n\nFig. 1.

Thrips infections are characterized by the appearance of white or silvery flecks on the leaves (Fig. 2). The underside of leaves may also carry black spots as an indication of infection. To treat thrips infections, fumigate with nicotine 40% shreds (DowElanco), or Lindane smoke pellets (Octavius Hunt) at 14-d intervals. If the infestation is severe, fumigation may be carried out three times at 7-d intervals, although this may result in some scorching of the plants. Alternatively, granules of Temik 10G (Union Carbide, Harrogate, West Yorkshire, UK), or Basudin 5G (Ciba-Geigy) may be sprinkled around and watered in. 3.1.5. Whitefly Whitefly infections are characterized by small, snow-white, four-winged flies and very small pale green nymphs which cover the underside of leaves (Fig. 3). Damage is caused through the flies feeding on the sap of the plants. Heavy infections will result in plants lacking vigor, wilting, and dying. Whitefly build-up is not as rapid as in aphid infections, but regular checking of plant material will minimize whitefly damage. To combat whitefly infections, fumigate with Lindane smoke pellets (Octavius Hunt) or Propoxur smokes (Octavius Hunt) at weekly intervals.\n\n24\n\nAnderson\n\nFig. 3. Whitefly adults and nymphs together on the underside of a petunia leaf. Magnification x 1S.\n\n3.2. Arabidopsis Diseases In gene&, f&gal infections are lesscommon than insectinfestation. The risk of infection is decreasedby avoiding overwateiing and allowing the surface of soil to partially dry betweenwaterings.Allow good air circulation over soil, and avoid completely covering potsor nays,exceptwhen theyate first establishedin soil after transfer fmm tissuecultuxe.Also, avoid planting material too closetogether as this can cause problems, particularly with ecotypeswhich pmduce very large anddensemsettes. 3.2.1. Botrytis Rotrytis infection is characterized by plants developing gray, fluffy mold on the leaves which then rot (Fig. 4). Infected material should be cleared and surrounding plants treated. Spray or drench plants with a solution of Benlate systemic fungicide (ICI, Haslemere, Surreys, UK). 3.2.2. Powdery Mildew Powdery mildew is characterized by a thin, powdery covering to leaves, stems, and siliques (Fig. 5). Severe infections can lead to plant wilt and death. Spray or drench plants with a solution of Benlate systemic fungicide (ICI). 4.

Cell suspensions are used for generating large amounts of cells for quantitative or qualitative analysis of growth responses and metabolism of novel chemicals, as well as for studies of cell cycle under standard conditions (2,3). In addition, cell suspensions serve as an ideal material for the isolation of protoplasts used in transient gene expression assays and Agrobacterzummediated transformation (4,5). The establishment of suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thalzana cells derived from leaf and hypocotyl calli has been reported (6). In order to mitiate Arabzdopsis suspensions retammg a high regenerative potential, a procedure described by Ford (7) has been modified Callus tissues derived from root or hypocotyl explants of Arabzdopszs yield well proliferating cell suspensionscapable of morphogenesis m liquid medium. The regeneration capability and genetic stability of suspension cells, however, decrease by the length of culture period Therefore, it is recommended to use newly initiated cell suspensions when the applications require the regeneration of dtplotd fertile plants The method described is used to establish morphogenic cell suspensions from the Arabidopszs ecotypes Columbia, C24, RLD, and Wassilewskila. Slight modification of the concentration of growth regulators (e.g., auxm) and/or the time of subcultures may be required for other ecotypes. 2. Materials 1.

Collect the seeds by slow centrtfugatlon m a microfuge for a few seconds and remove the supernatant Wash the seeds five times with 1 mL of sterile water. 3 Germinate the seeds m Petri dishes contammg 0 5X MS medium with 0 8% agar usmg 16 h light to 8 h dark period at 25°C. 4 Place 15-20 I-wk-old seedlings mto 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks contammg 35 mL of liquid MS medium with 3% sucrose 5. Place the flasks on a shaker set for 120 rpm at 25°C under 16 h light to 8 h dark penod 6. Harvest roots after 15-20 d (see Note 3).\n\n3.1.2. Initiation of Cell Suspensions 1 Place the roots collected from an Erlenmeyer flask mto a 9-cm Petri dish and remove all green tissue. 2 Usmg a scalpel blade or scissors, cut the roots into fine pieces (approx 2 mm long). 3 Remove the rest of hquid medium and resuspend the root explants m approx 50 mL of suspension medium m an Erlenmeyer flask (see Note 4). 4 Place the flask on the shaker and cover with alumimum foil (see Note 5) 5. Harvest the cells released from root call1 after 2 1 d; using a 25-mL plpet and pass them through a 850 pm sieve (see Notes 6 and 7) 6. Allow the cells to settle for about 30 mm before gently removmg the liquid medium from the top. Add fresh suspension medium (up to 50 mL) and place the\n\nCell Suspension Cultures\n\n29\n\nflask back onto the shaker The roots left m the sieve can be resuspended m fresh medium to generate more cells m suspensions (see Note 6)\n\n3.2. Initiation\n\nof Cell Suspensions\n\nfrom Seed-Derived\n\nCalli\n\n1 Sterilize seeds as described in Subheading 3.1.1. and place approx 1000 seeds m 50 mL liquid suspension medium m an Erlenmeyer flask (see Note 8). 2 Place the flask on the shaker and cover with alummmm foil 3. Examine the cultures at periodic intervals after 2 1 d by taking out 0 5-mL aliquots from the flasks and observmg under a microscope. 4 Once the cultures contam large number of single cells and prohferatmg cell clumps, sieve the cells sequentially through 850~pm and 500-pm sieves to obtain a homogenous starting material for suspension culture. 5 Allow the cells to settle and then replace the medium as described m Subheading 3.1.2. (see Note 6)\n\n3.3. Maintenance\n\nof Cell Suspensions\n\n1 Sieve and subculture the cell suspensions every 7 d until a homogenous proliferatmg cell population IS established (see Notes 9 and 10) 2. After the fifth subculture, the suspensions can be usually divided mto three portions at the time of subculture. To achieve this, approx 100 mL of fresh suspension medium is added to 50-mL cell suspension m the flask. After swirling the flask, 50-mL ahquots are dispensed into new flasks\n\n4. Notes 1 A 100X stock of B5 vitamm is prepared in distilled water and added to the medium before autoclavmg Growth regulator stocks of 1 mg/mL are filtersterilized and added to cooled medium. All stocks are stored at 4°C 2 Do not sterilize too many seeds m one Eppendorf tube because their drymg may cause a problem In case the seeds would clump, use a sterile toothpick to break the clumps before plating the seeds. 3. After 15-20 d approx 3-5 g of roots (fresh weight) should be available in each flask. The growth rate of roots is important for obtammg fine suspensions. The roots should be white, actively growing and not yellow-brown or green 4. For the Arabzdopsrs RLD ecotype the application of 4.0 mg/L of a-naphtheleneacetic acid instead of other hormones m the suspension medium should also result in fast cell proliferation. 5 A dark incubator may be useful, smce we have found considerable dtfferences between the growth rates of cell cultures grown m the dark m comparison to those grown in the hght The slower growth rate m the light may be the result of photodegradation of IAA 6 Great care has to be taken to ensure aseptic conditions Flame the neck of flasks well before opening them. Constant swirling of the flask and moving the pipet is necessary to avoid clogging.\n\n30\n\nMathur and Koncz\n\n7 Occassionally check the cultures for bacterial and/or fungal contamination by plating ahquot of the supernatant on bacterial growth media and/or subculturmg a small ahquot of cells m a rich medium contammg 1% glucose added to the suspension medium. 8 In the case of certain Arabzdopsrs mutants, the root development may be inhibited, and tt 1s thus dtflicult to obtain suitable amount of starting root material. By mittatmg seed dertved calh, usually this problem can be successfully overcome 9 At this stage, usually 3 g (fresh weight) of cell suspension is subcultured m 50 mL of medium and a three to fourfold increase in fresh weight is obtamed durmg a growth period of 7 d Such cultures reach then exponential phase between d 2 5 and 5 5 A prolongation of culture period for more than 8 d results m rapid brownmg and cell death 10. Cultures at this stage are composed of single cells (approx 10-25 pm m length) and clumps of 1664 cells\n\nReferences 1. King, P J.

Introduction Regeneration of plants by micropropagation of in vitro cultures can be achieved from organ primordia existing m shoot tips and axillary bud explants. Alternatively, plants can be regenerated from unorganized callus tissues derived from different explants by dedifferentiation induced by exogenous growth regulators. Plant regeneration from call1 is possible by de MWOorganogenesis or somatic embryogenesis. Callus cultures also facilitate the amphfication of limitmg plant material. In addition, plant regeneration from call1 permits the isolation of rare somaclonal variants which result either from an existmg genetic variability in somatic cells or from the induction of mutations, chromosome aberrations, and epigenetic changes by the m vitro applied environmental stimuli, including growth factors added to the cultured cells (1-3). In Arabidopszs thallana, one of the earliest studies on callus formation was conducted by Loewenberg (4), who grew seedlmgs m a medium containing kinetin and parachlorophenoxyacetic acid. Subsequent studies (for review, see ref. 5) of cell culture and regeneration demonstrated that it is relatively easy to regenerate Arabidopm from callus cultures by many approaches. However, the efficiency of regeneration and the proportion of somaclonal variants are considerably influenced by the ecotype and the source of explants, as well as by the medium and growth regulators employed. Hypocotyl and root explants thus provide excellent materials for callus imtiation and regeneration in contrast to stem and leaf explants. The tissue culture protocols include callus induction m auxin contaming media. Shoot regeneration is induced by lowering the auxin content and mcreasing the cytokinin levels m the media. The elongated shoots are usually transferred into root induction media, but even in the absence of roots, flowering and seed setting can take place m test tubes m vitro.

Without changing the general protocol, some slight alterations may be required for other ecotypes or mutants of Arabidopsls\n\n2.

Introduction Protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated from a variety of explant sources with varying degree of success (I-3), Most workers have faced problems in achieving a high frequency of sustainable division of protoplasts m liquid culture. The problem can be alleviated to a certain extent by embedding mesophyll protoplasts m calcium algmate (4). We have developed a technique allowing the culture of protoplasts derived from roots or cell suspensions m llqurd medium and then regeneration to plantlets (2). The yield of root-derived protoplasts capable of division and regeneration IS considerably higher in comparison to protoplasts obtained from leaf mesophyll cells. The protoplast lsolatton requires a ready supply of root cultures marntamed m auxin containing medium. Alternatively, a high yield of protoplasts, suitable for transient gene expression studies using direct DNA transformatron, can also be obtained from cell suspension cultures, excluding any limitatton of available starting material. Because the methods may have to be tailored to the needs of different experiments, here we describe protocols for the rsolatlon and culture of protoplasts from leaf mesophyll tissue (4), as well as from root and cell suspension cultures. These methods are equally effective for the Arabzdopszs ecotypes Columbia, C24, RLD, and WaSSllJeWSkiJa.\n\n2. Materials\n\n2.1. Materials and Equipment 1. Dry seeds of Arabldopsls 2.

Plate the seeds for germmatton on 0.5 BM agar plates. 2 To grow plants for mesophyll protoplast isolation, transfer 5-8 7-d-old seedlings mto 250-mL Jars containing BM medium and culture them at 25°C using 16 h light and 8 h dark period (see Note 1) 3 Use leaves from 3-5-wk-old plants (see Note 2) 4. Cut leaves in half through the mid vem and then into 4-6 pieces by cross-sectionmg with a sharp blade (see Note 3) 5 Wash the cut leaves once with 0 45M sucrose solution Transfer the leaf explants into a 9-cm Petri dish and add 15 mL of enzyme solution Incubate the material for 12-16 h at room temperature in the dark (see Note 4). 6 Shake the Petri dishes gently to release the protoplasts and incubate them further for 30 mm (see Note 5) 7. Collect the protoplast suspension using a broad-mouthed pipet using gentle suction, and filter the protoplast sequentially through 100 pm and 50 un-~sieves (see Note 6) 8 Gently dispense the protoplast suspension into 12-mL screw-capped glass tubes and centrifuge at 50g for 5 min. 9. Remove the dark-green band of floating protoplasts concentrated at the top of the tubes and transfer them to a new glass tube (see Note 7). 10. Add 10 mL 0.45M manmtol solution and centrifuge the protoplasts at 60g for 5 mm Resuspend the protoplast pellet and wash the cells twice in a similar fashion with 0.45M manmtol solutton. 11. Suspend the protoplast pellet obtained after the final wash in 1 mL of sodium algmate solution and count the protoplast yield using a hemocytometer. Adjust the protoplast density to 5-7 x lo5 cells/ml by adding more algmate solution (see Notes 8 and 9). 12. Using a wide-bore ptpet, take up the protoplasts dispersed in sodmm alginate solutton and create 250-500~pL drops on the surface of calcium-agar plates (see Note 10) 13. Allow the algtnate to form a gel for 45 min.

Remove 2.5 mL of the PM medium and add 2.5 mL of fresh PM medium after 7 and 14 d (see Note 11). 15 Remove 1 mL of PM medium and add 1 mL of MSAR I medium to the protoplast cultures on d 21, 28, and 35 (see Note 12).\n\n38\n\nMathur and Koncz\n\n3.1.2. Root- Derived Protoplas ts 1 Sterthze seeds for 15 mm using 10% sodium hypochlortte solutton and after washing and drymg of the seeds, plate them on 0 5 x BM agar plates. 2. In order to obtain root cultures for protoplasts, transfer 15-20 7-d-old seedlings into 50 mL of BM m Erlenmeyer flasks and place the flasks on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm and 25’C using 16 h ltght and 8 h dark period (see Note 13) 3 After 10-14 d growth, remove plantlets from the flasks and separate the roots from the green tissue Using a scalpel, cut the roots into small pteces (approx 2- 4 mm) and transfer the root segments mto Petri dishes with MSAR I medium (see Note 14) 4 Place the Petri dishes on a shaker set at 100 rpm m the dark (or at low light condmons) for 7-12 d (see Note 15) 5. Remove the liquid medmm from the Petri plates and wash the root explants once with 0.45M sucrose solution Remove the washmg solution and add approx 20 mL of enzyme solutton (see Note 4) 6 Incubate the root explants for 12-16 h with occasional shaking (see Note 16) 7 Collect the protoplast with a broad-mouthed pipet using gentle suction and sieve them through loo-, 50-, and 25-pm sieves (see Notes 6 and 17) 8. Place the protoplast suspension m screw-capped 12 mL glass tubes and centrifuge for 5 mm at 50g 9. Collect the band of floating protoplasts concentrated at the top of the solution and transfer them mto a new tube (see Notes 7 and 18) 10 Resuspend the protoplasts In 0.45Mmanmtol solution and pellet the cells at 60g for 5 mm Wash the protoplast pellet by repeating this step twice (see Note 19) 11 If the protoplasts are bemg cultured m algmate drops, suspend the cells m 1 mL of algmate solutton. If the protoplasts are bemg cultured m liquid medium, resuspend the cells m 1 mL of PM medium 12. Take 5 pL from the protoplast suspension and count the number of cells m a hemocytometer (see Note 20) 13. For embedding of the protoplasts, use a wide-bore ptpet to take up the cells dispersed m sodium algmate solutton (at a density of 3-5 x lo* cells/ml) and create 250-500~pL drops on calcium-agar plates (see Notes 10 and 21). 14. Transfer the drops of alginate gel-carrying protoplasts into 55-mm Petri dishes containing approx 5 mL of PM medium and culture the protoplasts m a growth chamber at 25’C under dim light 15. For ltquid culture, adjust the mmal density of protoplasts to 1 x lo6 cells/ml until cell divtstons start and then dilute the protoplast suspension wtth PM medium to a density of 5 x lo5 cells/ml (see Note 22) 16 Remove 2 5 mL of the spent medium and add 2 5 mL of fresh PM medium after 7 and 14 d (see Note 11) 17. Remove 1 mL of PM medium and add 1 mL of MSAR I medium on d 2 1,28, and 35 (see Note 12)\n\nProtoplas t Culture and Regenera t/on\n\n39\n\n3.1.3. Protoplasts from Cell Suspensions 1. Methods used for the mltlatlon and maintenance of cell suspensions are described m Chapter 4 2 Collect 50 mL of 2-d-old cell suspension m a sterile Falcon tube and allow the cells to settle for 5-7 mm. Remove the supernatant. 3. Wash the cells once with 0 45M sucrose solution and centrifuge them at 50g for 5 mm 4 Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted cells in approx 50 mL of protoplastmg enzyme solution (see Note 4). 5 Dispense the cells m three, 90-n-m Petri dishes, seal the plates with parafilm, and place them on a shaker at 50 rpm. 6 After 4 h of mcubatlon, collect the protoplast suspension and filter the cells through 50- and 25-q sieves Dispense the protoplasts to 12-mL, screw-capped glass tubes (see Note 17) 7 Centrifuge the protoplasts for 5 mm at 50g Collect the band of floating protoplasts from the top of solution (see Notes 7 and 18). 8 Wash the protoplasts twice with 0 45M manmtol solution by centrifuging at 60g for 5 mm and resuspendmg the pellet each time (see Note 19). 9 Resuspend the protoplasts in 1 mL of PM medium or algmate sol&Ion (as described m Subheading 3.1.2.) and count the cell number m a hemocytometer (see Note 20) 10 For hquld culture, adjust the dens@ of protoplasts m PM medium to 1 x 1O6cells/ml When the protoplasts start dividing, dilute the suspension with PM medium to 5 x lo5 cells/ml (see Note 22). 11. For embedding the protoplast into algmate, adjust the cell density to 3- 5 x lo5 cells/ml and create algmate drops of 250- 5OG pL on calcium-agar plates (see Note 10) 12 After 45 min, remove algmate drops carrying the embedded protoplasts and transfer them mto 55-mm Petri dishes containing 5 mL of PM medium Culture the protoplasts at 25T under low light conditions (see Note 21) 13 Remove 2 5 mL of the spent medmm and add 2.5 mL of fresh PM medium after 7 and 14 d(see Note 11) 14. Remove 1 mL of PM medium and add 1 mL of MSAR I medium on d 2 1,28, and 35 (see Note 12).\n\n3.2. Regeneration of Plants from Pro toplast-Derived Calli 1 Remove the liquid medium using a plpet, and transfer the mlcrocalli carried by the alginate beads, after sectlonmg the gel beads into four to five pieces, mto MSAR II medium (see Note 23) 2 Place the Petri dishes m an illuminated culture room (3000 lx) using 16 light and 8 h dark period at 25°C 3. Pick out green call1 and regenerating shoots and transfer them mto MSAR II medium until shoots attain a size of approx 2 cm (see Note 24).\n\n40\n\nMathur and Koncz\n\n4 Transfer the shoots into MSAR III medium to induce root formation for 3-6 d, then place the plantlets m culture tubes containing 0.5X BM agar medium with only 0.5% sucrose for flowering and seed setting (see Note 25)\n\n4. Notes 1. Do not place the glass jars close to the light source because condensation inside the jars results m vltrlficatlon of the leaves 2. The age and state of leaves is critical (8). Do not use pale, discolored, curled, or vitrified leaves. Do not use leaves from plants that are already flowering 3 In order to decrease the amount of debris m the protoplast preparation, the cut should be clean and the leaf should not be crushed Allow the weight of the blade and handle alone to do the cutting and change the blade between different dishes. 4. The activity of enzyme preparations may differ from batch to batch and thus the optimal time of mcubatlon may vary. It 1sadvisable to determine the requirements for optimal protoplasting and store a particular enzyme batch m bulk 5 At this stage of enzyme digestion, the cell suspension should be green in color and numerous spherical protoplasts should be seen floatmg under the microscope. A dirty preparation will contain many broken protoplasts and may result m low viability of surviving protoplasts 6. We use steel sieves of different pore size available from Fastnacht (Bonn, Germany), but plastic mesh with the right pore size can be sewn mto a cone and put m a glass funnel fitted onto a lOO-mL Erlenmeyer flask. The whole assembly can be wrapped by alummmm foil and sterilized by autoclavmg. 7 Although the band of floating protoplasts 1sremoved carefully, some protoplasts are invariably lost An alternatlve way IS to use a thin, sterile, glass capillary tube connected to a pipet pump with a narrow tubing The capillary 1s inserted to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and the debris pellet and the enzyme solution are gently removed without disturbing the band of floating protoplasts. 8. An optimal preparation from leaves of five plants yields about 3-4 x lo6 protoplasts. 9 Gelrite solution (0.2% dissolved in 0.45M sucrose solution) can be used instead of sodium algmate solution m the same fashion This obviates the need of releasing the microcalh from the embedding matrix at a later stage, which may be necessary when algmate ts used as embedding matrix 10 Larger drops may be prepared and later cut mto smaller pieces. However, we find it easier to use small drops since it does not create problems m spreading. Also, mdlvidual and uniform drops carrying roughly the same number of protoplasts can be used to test a wide range of culture media and conditions 11. After 14 d of culture, the dividing cells should form colonies of 4-16 cells. For leaf mesophyll protoplasts, this time may be extended by another 7 d 12. By day 35, mlcrocalh are vrslble that may differentiate to roots and somatic embryo-like structures. 13. Roots should be actively growing, white m color, and not yellow-brown or green The plants grown m the flask should not flower. The quality of root cultures affect the yield of protoplasts and the time required for subsequent cell proliferation.\n\nProtoplast Culture and Regeneration\n\n41\n\n14. Divide the roots from one 250-mL flask mto three portions and, after cutting them mto smaller pieces, transfer each portion of roots mto approx 20 mL of MSAR I medium m a 90-mm Petri dish. More root material in this volume may delay the cell proliferatton response. 15. Root explants exhibit numerous regions of cell prohferation, particularly at the sites of lateral roots, and assume a bulging appearance at this stage. They should be white in color and not brown The liquid medium at this stage shall contain a few single cells. 16. Protoplasts start to be released after 4 h, and a pertodic check is beneficial to reach an opttmal yield (1.5-3 x lo6 cells/ml). Alternatively, digestion of roots wtth 2.0% cellulase (Onozuka R-10, Serva) releases protoplasts within 3-5 h. 17. A glass Pasteur prpet with the tip broken off serves well since the protoplasts are not subjected to the suction force in the narrow diameter of the pipet tip 18 Collect the protoplast bands from three tubes into one tube to obtain a sufficient pellet size in the subsequent steps 19. When changing the solutions, try to remove as much of the previous solution as posstble without disturbing the protoplast pellet. The soft transition from one osmoticum to another results m less protoplast bursting and loss between the steps. 20 If the number of protoplasts exceeds lOO/square of the hemocytometer, dilute the protoplast suspension 2 1. Protoplasts embedded m algmate may be slower m dividing by 1 or 2 d. 22 Depending on the quality of protoplast preparation, up to 75% of protoplasts survtve and 2040% of cells will undergo divisions during the first 3-5 d of culture In liquid medmm, an mmal high density may result in aggregation and collapse of protoplasts. Therefore, care should be taken to properly dilute the protoplast suspension. Aggregation of protoplasts may also be observed rf there was too much debars and/or dead protoplasts m the preparation, which may be a consequence of either inadequate removal of the enzyme durmg the washes or sudden osmotic changes. 23 Alternative approaches involve a depolymerization of the alginate gel in 20 mM sodium curate solutton, using an appropriate osmoticum (4), or a removal of visible mtcrocalh from the algmate gel and transferring them in the regeneration medium (9). We found that the regeneration of calli comprising of more than 64 cells is not hindered by algmate embedding 24. Care must be taken to remove dead cells from the regenerating cultures 25 The culture tubes are capped with loose cotton to facilitate a proper aeration necessary for seed setting m vitro Take care not to place the tubes too close to the light source because this will cause moisture condensatton inside the tubes and result in low efficiency of fertilization. Alternatively, rooted plants can be transferred to soil after washing the roots gently with a dilute fungicidal solutton (e.g., 0.02% Benomyl, DuPont, Boston, MA) After proper hardening, the plants will flower and set seed.\n\nReferences 1 Morris, P C. and Altmann, T (1994) Tissue culture and transformation, in A&rdopszs.

Introduction Only structurally intact chloroplasts with a functional envelope exhibit metabolic activities comparable to those of the original tissues. Therefore, the most important objectives that should guide the isolation of chloroplasts from any plant species are then morphological and physiological integrity The use of intact chloroplasts is absolutely essential for studying processes like light-driven CO2 fixation, CO*-dependent O2 evolution, znorganello RNA and protein synthesis, import of cytoplasmically made polypeptides into chloroplasts, or mcorporation of labeled precursors to dissect the enzymatic machinery involved m fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid mcorporation mto chloroplast lipids In some plant species, like spinach or pea, highly active chloroplasts can be obtained by followmg several simple rules: 1. Use of young, fresh plant material free from starch 2 Disruption of cells m a medmm contaimng buffered sorbltol 3. Rapid separation of chloroplasts from the remaining cell constituents\n\nUnfortunately, the standard protocols for chloroplast isolation (1,2) typically result in poor chloroplast yields, or chloroplasts of low activity, when applied to Arabidopsis. The reasons for this apparent sensitivity of Arabzdopszs chloroplasts are not known. However, concerted efforts of several research groups to optimize established chloroplast isolation protocols for Arabidopsis and the discovery that the inclusion of high levels of EDTA or EGTA in the isolation medium is critical for the recovery of active chloroplasts (3), led to the development of two reliable procedures:chloroplastisolation by homogenization of leaf tissue using polytron and chloroplast isolation from protoplasts. From Methods m Molecular Brology, Vol 82 Arabidopsrs Protocols Edited by J Martmez-Zapater and J Salrnas 0 Humana Press Inc , Totowa,\n\n43\n\nNJ\n\nKunst\n\n44\n\nAlthough both procedures yield intact chloroplasts capable of high rates of CO*-dependent O2 evolution, they differ m several important ways. Polytron homogemzatlon ISsimpler and more rapid, but the recovery of intact chloroplasts is rarely >30% of that obtained by the protoplast lsolatlon method. On the other hand, m our experience, chloroplasts prepared from protoplasts exhlblt very low rates of lipid biosynthesis from radloactlvelly labeled precursors, owing perhaps to a relatively long ttme required for the enzymatic dlgestion of the leaves. Thus, the method of choice ~111ultimately depend on the intended use of the isolated chloroplasts. 2. Materials 2.7. Plant Material Preparation 1 Two-to-three-week-old 2 Razor blade 3.
