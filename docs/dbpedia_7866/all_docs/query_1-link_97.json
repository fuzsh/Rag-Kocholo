        "text": "Detecting chaos in time-to-death distributions\n\nWhen faced with a time series sampled from some dynamical process, one might want to detect whether the underlying process is chaotic or stochastic. Of course, there could be some stochasticity on top of an underlying chaotic process, in which case one might still want to detect the presence of chaos. The difficulty arises from the fact that many statistics of a chaotic process resemble a stochastic one -- the determinism of the process rendered barely detectable due to the unstable dynamical trajectories characteristic of chaos. However, methods exist for distinguishing chaos (18, 19). One such method is the permutation spectrum test, studying the distribution of ordinal patterns in short consecutive subsequences of the time series (20, 21). In particular, the existence of forbidden ordinal patterns -- those with no or almost no occurrence -- is known as a strong indication of chaos, which distinguishes it from a truly stochastic time series. In the experiments described here, a population of hosts are exposed to pathogens, and the resulting time-to-death distribution is compared to that of a naturally occurring time-to-death distribution of a control population. In this case, the problem of detecting underlying chaos in the dynamics of host-microbe interactions, when the readout is time-to-death, is complicated by two factors. First, we do not have access to the internal dynamics of the system, only to the time at which a terminal event (death) occurs. Second, since we only gather one data point from each individual (time until death), we must study an assemblage of systems rather than a single continual system. This forces a degree of randomness on the data, especially as we cannot control the system’s internal parameters. In particular, we can no longer use the permutation spectrum test in the traditional way, since we have a distribution of time-to-deaths pulled from a sample population rather than a sample of time-series from single individual subjects. In addition, we note that that in both worms and flies, the infection does not occur at the same time for all animals and that the time zero reflects the beginning of the experiment rather than the time of initial infection. Nevertheless, as stated in the methods, for both systems infection is expected to occur shortly after the experiments begin. Given that this is a physiological infection method where the animals are infected by ingesting the pathogen, repeated infections theoretically likely but neither are common since infected worms remain infected after first injecting bacteria and flies incur such gut damage from initial infection that they are unlikely to be candidates for subsequent infection. Hence, our dynamic analysis is for the whole infection system rather than for individual animals and note that this approach is more akin to what happens in natural epidemics resulting from the encounter of a pathogen with a susceptible host population.\n\nFaced with these problems, we devised a new test that we term an “inversion measure”, which we suggest can be used in detecting chaos based only on the distribution of time-to-event in an ensemble system. This method is based on a histogram representation of the time-to-event distribution. Similarly, to the permutation spectrum test, we subdivide the histogram’s bins into consecutive non-overlapping sequences of k=4 bins. For each such sequence, we check whether it is an inversion, meaning the direction of change from second to third bin is opposite to the direction of change from first to fourth. We measure the frequency of 4-bin sequences which are inversions. We base this measure on the understanding that distributions that are roughly smooth after averaging away random noise would have fewer inversions, whereas distributions that are less smooth and more irregular, which is a characteristic of chaos (18), would potentially have more inversions. Indeed, as the direction of change from the first to fourth bin is expected to indicate the local linear trend, the direction of change from the second to third bin would be expected, on average, to align with this trend as well. Our measure is inspired by the permutation spectrum test in studying the aggregate behavior of short sequences of time. We assign a p-value to the measure based on bootstrapping against a null hypothesis that the distribution is locally linear (See Methods for more details). Thus, a low p-value indicates the distribution significantly deviates from a locally linear one and may have chaotic characteristics. We note, however, that this is not a definitive indicator of chaos but rather of persistent nonlinear irregularities that could arise from chaos. In this paper, we propose this measure as a preliminary test for discriminating between truly stochastic processes and chaotic ones, based on time-to-event distributions. This is a nonparametric test as the null hypothesis makes no assumptions about the specific shape of the time-to-event distribution other than its local linearity.\n\nTo begin validating this measure, we apply it to simulated time-to-event data from two processes, one chaotic and one stochastic. Specifically, for a chaotic process, we generate data from the logistic map (18) x → rx(1 - x), with 0< x < 1 and parameter 0<r < 4. The logistic map is known to be chaotic for certain parameters r. We selected r = 3.9 and measured the distribution of time-to-event, where an event is considered to occur when the dynamic variable x falls in a certain fixed small region (for us, the interval (0.2 .. 0.21)), and the initial distribution is uniformly sampled from the interval (0 .. 1). For the stochastic process, we sample from a geometric distribution with the same mean, that is the time-to-event distribution of a stochastic Bernoulli process.\n\nThe resulting time distributions look qualitatively similar for sufficiently long waiting times (see Figure 1), while the distribution of short waiting times is erratic for the chaotic process. Consequently, detecting chaos in such time-to-event distributions can be expected to be difficult since the chaotic signature is most noticeable only for sufficiently short waiting times.\n\nWe find a higher proportion of inversions in the chaotic data as opposed to the stochastic data, and we find statistical significance for rejecting the null hypothesis of a locally linear distribution in the chaotic case (p<0.05), but not in the stochastic one (p=0.41), see Figure 2. These results suggest that our inversion measure is capable of discriminating chaos from stochastic behavior using only time-to-event distributions without access to the underlying time-series itself.\n\nTo further test the ability of the inversion measure to reliably detect chaotic signature, we applied the same test to time-to-event distributions associated to two other known chaotic systems: the Henon map and the Lorenz system, which are respectively two- and three-dimensional. In each of these, we picked a small window in space that intersects the attractor of the system (so it will be repeatedly visited by the system) and define this window as our “event”. The Henon map is given by the dynamics . We used the “classical” Henon given by a = 1.4, b = 0.3, and we defined our event window by [0.25,0.35] x [0.15,0.25]. The Lorenz system is a differential equation given by . We approximated this differential equation by the corresponding difference equation with step size 0.01, using the parameters σ = 10, ρ= 28, β;= 8/3 (the “classical” Lorenz system used by Lorenz), with the event window given by [-1.0,1.0] x [-1.0.1.0] x [13.0, 1.5.0]. We used 10,000 sample points for each process. To test the sensitivity of the system to the number of histogram bins, for both the Lorenz and Henon systems we binned the waiting time data into a range of bins number from 50 to 1000 bins before applying the inversion measure. For both systems, the inversion measure again rejects the null hypothesis with statistical significance.\n\nAs stochastic control, we sampled data from various Weibull distributions, which is a common family of distributions of waiting times, with a wide variety of shapes. We swept over different choices of parameters for the number of bins for the histogram, and for each one ran the inversion measure multiple times to calculate the percentage of false positives. We found that for a certain range of bin size parameters (around 100-300 bins, given 10000 sample points), false positives were low for a variety of Weibull distributions (ranging between 3% and 7%). However, if more bins were used, the number of false positives increased significantly. Still, given an appropriate choice for the number of bins, we were broadly able to distinguish between chaotic systems and stochastic ones. Specifically, when using 256 bins on 1000 runs of 10,000 sample points each for data coming from Weibull distribution, Lorenz, and Henon maps, we obtained a 9.8% false negative rate for the Lorenz process, an 11% false rate for the Henon process and a 6.6% false negative rate for the Weibull distribution. For these tests we used a kernel-smoothed density (MATLAB function ksdensity with its default settings) as the null hypothesis, rather than a local linearization.\n\nAn additional problem associated with the inversion method needs further investigations. The inversion method uses the distribution of time-to-events as its input rather than a dynamic time-series. This fact makes it harder to discriminate between chaotic and stochastic dynamics for certain chaotic systems whose time-to-event stationary distributions are similar to those of stochastic processes, an issue which can be heightened when taking into account the distribution of longer waiting times, for which the chaotic signal tends to fade away.\n\nThe inversion measure on a time distribution\n\nGiven a distribution of times, we first convert the distribution into a histogram. In the case when the time points are naturally discrete, such as in our simulated data of waiting times sampled from discrete chaotic or stochastic processes, then we use each discrete time point as a bin. In the case of a continuous process, then we pick a parameter n and divide the time distribution into n bins.\n\nGiven a histogram with n bins, where each bin contains a whole number, we first add a random noise, distributed uniformly at random between 0 and epsilon, where epsilon<1, to the histogram so as to break ties, ensuring each bin has a unique value while preserving the order of the unequal counts. Then we subdivide the bins into consecutive nonoverlapping sequences of 4 bins each, with the remainder discarded. For each such sequence x1, x2, x3, x4, it is countertrend, or an inversion, if (x4 - x1) and (x3 - x2) have the same signs (positive or negative). We then calculated the frequency of sequences which are inversions. Since this frequency depends on the randomness of the tie-breaking procedure, we rerun this process 1000 times with different randomizations and take the average.\n\nTo obtain a p-value for the inversion measure, we used a bootstrap against a null hypothesis that the histogram is smooth. We consider two types of null-density: kernelsmoothed and locally linear. For the kernel smoothing, we applied MATLAB’s built-in ksdensity function to the sample histogram. For the locally linear null density, we locally linearized the sample histogram as follows. For each consecutive sequence of 4 bins, let x1, x2, x3, x4 be the corresponding sequence of whole numbers. We calculate a line of best fit for xi as a function of i, and let this line of best fit be the null density for this sequence. If the line goes below 0, we reset the negative numbers to 0’s. We repeat this process for each sequence of 4 bins, resulting in a piecewise linear null density (which is then normalized to sum to 1). To generate a bootstrap from a null density (either a kernel smoothed density or a locally linear one), we sample from it the same number of points as in the original sample and recalculate the inversion measure. We do this 1,000 times to generate a bootstrapped null distribution of the inversion measure. We then calculate a t-statistic and its p-value by comparing the sample inversion measure to this null distribution.\n\nFor the fly datasets, in which some observations were not made in regular intervals, we redistributed events along gaps as follows. Whenever one or more observations were missed, we randomly uniformly distributed the next-observed number of events along the interval between the given observation and the prior observation. We then formed a histogram from this redistributed data and proceeded as before to calculate the inversion measure. Due to the randomness of redistribution, we carried this process out 1,000 times, thus generating a sample distribution of inversion measures. For each of these 1,000 histograms, we ran the bootstrap process with a sample size of 1,000, thereby generating a total of 1,000,000 inversion measures that make up the null distribution. We used these two distributions to generate a p value by estimating the probability that the sample inversion measure is greater than or equal to the null inversion measure.\n\nFor the uninfected flies, we combined two distinct datasets. In this case, we redistributed each dataset along gaps as mentioned above, and only then combined the two histograms into one and proceeded with the analysis as just described"
