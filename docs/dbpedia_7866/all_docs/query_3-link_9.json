Jacobson\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory\n\nContact\n\nJacobson’s lab focuses on the development and subsequent application of mathematical, statistical and computational methods to biological datasets in order to yield new insights into complex biological systems. Their approaches include the use of network theory and topology discovery/clustering, wavelet theory, machine and deep learning (amongst others: iterative random forests, deep neural networks, etc.) in a supercomputing context.\n\nAreas of statistics of particular interest to his lab include the use of both frequentist (parametric and non-parametric) and Bayesian methods as well as the development of new methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genome-wide epistasis studies (GWES) and phenome-wide associations/epistasis studies (PheWA/ES). These mathematical and statistical methods are applied to various population and (meta)multiomics data sets (genomics, phylogenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, viriomics, phytobiomics, chemiomics, etc.) individually as well as in combination in an attempt to better understand the functional relationships as well as biosynthesis, signaling, transcriptional, translational, degradation, and kinetic regulatory networks at play in biological organisms and communities as well as how they adapt to and interact with their environment.\n\nMany of the projects in his lab center around studying complex systems for bioenergy and phytobiomes. However, his lab takes a broad view of biological complexity and evolution that stretches from viruses to microbes to plants to humans (including neurological disorders and substance abuse). Jacobson’s group was the first group to break the exascale barrier. At present, this (2.36 Exaops) calculation is the fastest scientific calculation ever done anywhere in the world. This project led to his team winning the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize (the first ever for systems biology).\n\nTop\n\nMary Ann Moran\n\nUniversity of Georgia\n\nContact\n\nMoran is a Regents’ Professor and Foundation Distinguished Professor in the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Georgia.
