It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nIt's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nTeaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nThe important thing is not to stop questioning.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nThe only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nPlay is the highest form of research.\n\n- Albert Einstein\n\nExample is not the main thing in influencing others.

They seem to me to be built upon the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think.\n\n- Anne Sullivan\n\nIt's a great mistake, I think, to put children off with falsehoods and nonsense, when their growing powers of observation and discrimination excite in them a desire to know about things.\n\n- Anne Sullivan\n\nPeople seldom see the halting and painful steps at which the most insignificant success is achieved.\n\n- Anne Sullivan\n\nLearning is not a spectator sport.\n\n- Anonymous\n\nThe uncreative mind can spot wrong answers, but it takes a very creative mind to spot wrong questions.\n\n- Anthony Jay\n\nIf you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders.

King\n\nThank goodness I was never sent to school; it would have rubbed off some of the originality.\n\n- Beatrix Potter\n\nIf a man empties his purse into his head, no man can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.\n\n- Ben Franklin\n\nThe greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches, but to reveal to him his own.\n\n- Benjamin Disraeli\n\nGames lubricate the body and the mind.\n\n- Benjamin Franklin\n\nThe biggest atrocity of all is to indoctrinate our children into a system that does not value their creative expression, nor encourage their unique abilities.\n\n- Benjamin Greene\n\nTo teach a man how he may learn to grow independently, and for himself, is perhaps the greatest service that one man can do another.\n\n- Benjamin Jowett\n\nIntelligence is not to make no mistakes, but quickly to see how to make them good.\n\n- Bertolt Brecht\n\nAlmost all education has a political motive: it aims at strengthening some group, national or religious or even social, in the competition with other groups. It is this motive, in the main, which determines the subjects taught, the knowledge offered and the knowledge withheld, and also decides what mental habits the pupils are expected to acquire. Hardly anything is done to foster the inward growth of mind and spirit; in fact, those who have had the most education are very often atrophied in their mental and spiritual life.\n\n- Bertrand Russell\n\nMen are born ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education.\n\n- Bertrand Russell\n\nThe aim of education should be to teach us how to think, rather than what to think.

B. Neblette\n\nOne looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is a vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.\n\n- Carl Jung\n\nIf we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness.\n\n- Carl Rogers\n\nThe only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn ...and change.\n\n- Carl Rogers\n\nWhen you make the finding yourself--even if you are the last person on Earth to see the light--you will never forget it.\n\n- Carl Sagan\n\nChildren have more need of models than of critics.\n\n- Carolyn Coats\n\nA very little key will open a very heavy door.\n\n- Charles Dickens\n\nOf all the joyous motives of school life, the love of knowledge is the only abiding one; the only one which determines the scale, so to speak, upon which the person will hereafter live.\n\n- Charlotte Mason\n\nSelf-education is the only possible education; the rest is mere veneer laid on the surface of a child's nature.\n\n- Charlotte Mason\n\nA child's life is like a piece of paper on which every person leaves a mark.\n\n- Chinese Proverb\n\nIf you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are planning for a lifetime, educate people.\n\n- Chinese proverb\n\nLearning is a treasure which accompanies its owner everywhere.\n\n- Chinese Proverb\n\nOne must be a student before one can be a teacher.\n\n- Chinese Proverb\n\nTeachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself.\n\n- Chinese Proverb\n\nIf you want happiness for a lifetime, help the next generation.\n\n- Chinese saying\n\nRewards and punishments are the lowest form of education.\n\n- Chuang-Tzu\n\nIt is what we think we know already that often prevents us from learning.\n\n- Claude Bernard\n\nYou can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he will continue the learning process as long as he lives.\n\n- Clay P.

Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.\n\n- Groucho Marx\n\nThe plain fact is that education is itself a form of propaganda - a deliberate scheme to outfit the pupil, not with the capacity to weigh ideas, but with a simple appetite for gulping ideas ready-made. The aim is to make 'good' citizens, which is to say, docile and uninquisitive citizens.\n\n- H. L. Mencken\n\nHuman history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe...\n\n- H.G. Wells\n\nThe aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all; it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed a standard citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.\n\n- H.L.

Every individual makes a difference.\n\n- Jane Goodall\n\nBetter than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher.\n\n- Japanese Proverb\n\nThe principle goal of education is to create men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done.\n\n- Jean Piaget\n\nThe principle goal of education is to create men who are capable of doing new things, not simple of repeating what other generations have done--men who are creative, inventive, and discoverers.\n\n- Jean Piaget\n\nDo I dare set forth here the most important, the most useful rule of all education? It is not to save time, but to squander it.\n\n- Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nTrue teaching is one that not teaches knowledge but stimulates children to gain it.\n\n- Jill Eggleton\n\nNo matter how good teaching may be, each student must take the responsibility for his own education.\n\n- John Carolus\n\nWho dares to teach must never cease to learn.\n\n- John Cotton Dana\n\nWho dares to teach must never cease to learn.\n\n- John Cotton Dana\n\nEducation is not preparation for life; education is life itself.\n\n- John Dewey\n\nEducation is not preparation for life; education is life itself.\n\n- John Dewey\n\nAll of us do not have equal talent, but all of us should have an equal opportunity to develop our talent.\n\n- John F.

Everyone else is already taken.\n\n- Oscar Wilde\n\nThrough education comes understanding. Through understanding comes true appreciation. All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.\n\n- Pablo Picasso\n\nTeaching, like any truly human activity, emerges from one's inwardness, for better or worse. As I teach I project the condition of my soul onto my students, my subject, and our way of being together. The entanglements I experience in the classroom are often no more or less than the convolutions of my inner life. Viewed from this angle, teaching holds a mirror to the soul. If I am willing to look in that mirror and not run from what I see, I have a chance to gain self-knowledge--and knowing myself is as crucial to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject.\n\n- Parker Palmer\n\nA master can tell you what he expects of you.
