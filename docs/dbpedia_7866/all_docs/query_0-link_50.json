The availability of tomato ripening mutants has revealed many aspects of the genetics behind fleshy fruit ripening, plant hormones and light signal reception. Since previous analyses revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis influences tomato berry ripening, we wanted to test the hypothesis that an interplay might occur between root symbiosis and fruit ripening. With this aim, we screened seven tomato mutants affected in the ripening process for their responsiveness to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Following their phenological responses we selected two mutants for a deeper analysis: Green ripe (Gr), deficient in fruit ethylene perception and high-pigment-1 (hp-1), displaying enhanced light signal perception throughout the plant. We investigated the putative interactions between ripening processes, mycorrhizal establishment and systemic effects using biochemical and gene expression tools. Our experiments showed that both mutants, notwithstanding a normal mycorrhizal phenotype at root level, exhibit altered arbuscule functionality. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type, mycorrhization did not lead to a higher phosphate concentration in berries of both mutants. These results suggest that the mutations considered interfere with arbuscular mycorrhiza inducing systemic changes in plant phenology and fruits metabolism. We hypothesize a cross talk mechanism between AM and ripening processes that involves genes related to ethylene and light signaling.\n\nEnhanced transpiration rate in the high pigment 1 tomato mutant and its physiological significance.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarvalho, R F; Aidar, S T; Azevedo, R A; Dodd, I C; Peres, L E P\n\n2011-05-01\n\nTomato high pigment (hp) mutants represent an interesting horticultural resource due to their enhanced accumulation of carotenoids, flavonoids and vitamin C. Since hp mutants are known for their exaggerated light responses, the molecules accumulated are likely to be antioxidants, recruited to deal with light and others stresses. Further phenotypes displayed by hp mutations are reduced growth and an apparent disturbance in water loss. Here, we examined the impact of the hp1 mutation and its near isogenic line cv Micro-Tom (MT) on stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), CO(2) assimilation (A) and water use efficiency (WUE). Detached hp1 leaves lost water more rapidly than control leaves, but this behaviour was reversed by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), indicating the ability of hp1 to respond to this hormone. Although attached hp1 leaves had enhanced gs, E and A compared to control leaves, genotypic differences were lost when water was withheld. Both instantaneous leaf-level WUE and long-term whole plant WUE did not differ between hp1 and MT. Our results indicate a link between exaggerated light response and water loss in hp1, which has important implications for the use of this mutant in both basic and horticultural research.

Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) has been proposed to protect centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion by directly targeting Sgo1 to centromeres in mitosis. Here we show that HP1Î± is targeted to mitotic centromeres by INCENP, a subunit of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). Biochemical and structural studies show that both HP1âINCENP and HP1âSgo1 interactions require the binding of the HP1 chromo shadow domain to PXVXL/I motifs in INCENP or Sgo1, suggesting that the INCENP-bound, centromeric HP1Î± is incapable of recruiting Sgo1. Consistently, a Sgo1 mutant deficient in HP1 binding is functional in centromeric cohesion protection and localizes normally to centromeres in mitosis. By contrast, INCENP or Sgo1 mutants deficient in HP1 binding fail to localize to centromeres in interphase. Therefore, our results suggest that HP1 binding by INCENP or Sgo1 is dispensable for centromeric cohesion protection during mitosis of human cells, but might regulate yet uncharacterized interphase functions of CPC or Sgo1 at the centromeres.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms exaggerating the carotenoid accumulation and the chloroplast number in these mutants. A comparison of proteome profiles from the outer pericarp of hp1 mutant and wild-type (cv Ailsa Craig) fruits at different developmental stages revealed at least 72 differentially expressed proteins during ripening. Hierarchical clustering grouped these proteins into three clusters. We found an increased abundance of chromoplast-specific carotenoid-associated protein (CHRC) in hp1 fruits at red-ripe stage that is also reflected in its transcript level. Western blotting using CHRC polyclonal antibody from bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) revealed a 2-fold increase in the abundance of CHRC protein in the red-ripe stage of hp1 fruits compared with the wild type. CHRC levels in hp2 were found to be similar to that of hp1, whereas hp3 and Ip showed intermediate levels to those in hp1, hp2, and wild-type fruits. Both CHRC and carotenoids were present in the isolated plastoglobules. Overall, our results suggest that loss of function of DDB1, DET1, Zeaxanthin Epoxidase, and Ip up-regulates CHRC levels. Increase in CHRC levels may contribute to the enhanced carotenoid content in these high-pigment fruits by assisting in the sequestration and stabilization of carotenoids.

In this work, the folding mechanism of the mutant has been investigated by both conventional and replica exchange molecular dynamics (CMD and REMD) simulations with AMBER FF03 force field and a generalized-Born solvation model. Direct comparison to the ab initio folding of the wild type HP35 enabled a close examination on the mutational effect on the folding process. The mutant folded to the native state, as demonstrated by the 0.50Ã CÎ±-root mean square deviation (RMSD) sampled in both CMD and REMD simulations and the high population of the folded conformation compared with the denatured conformations. Consistent with experiments, the significantly reduced primary folding free energy barrier makes the mutant closer to a downhill folder than the wild type HP35 that directly leads to the faster transition and higher melting temperature. However, unlike the proposed downhill folding which envisages a smooth shift between unfolded and folded states without transition barrier, we observed a well-defined folding transition that was consistent with experiments. Further examination of the secondary structures revealed that the two mutated residues have higher intrinsic helical preference that facilitated the formation of both helix III and the intermediate state which contains the folded segment helix II/III. Other factors contributing to the faster folding include the more favorable electrostatic interactions in the transition state with the removal of the charged NH3+ groups from LYS. In addition, both transition state ensemble and denatured state ensemble are shifted in the mutant.\n\ndAdd1 and dXNP prevent genome instability by maintaining HP1a localization at Drosophila telomeres.\n\nPubMed\n\nChavez, Joselyn; Murillo-Maldonado, Juan Manuel; Bahena, Vanessa; Cruz, Ana Karina; CastaÃ±eda-SortibrÃ¡n, AmÃ©rica; Rodriguez-Arnaiz, Rosario; Zurita, Mario; Valadez-Graham, Viviana\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTelomeres are important contributors to genome stability, as they prevent linear chromosome end degradation and contribute to the avoidance of telomeric fusions. An important component of the telomeres is the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Mutations in Su(var)205, the gene encoding HP1a in Drosophila, result in telomeric fusions, retrotransposon regulation loss and larger telomeres, leading to chromosome instability. Previously, it was found that several proteins physically interact with HP1a, including dXNP and dAdd1 (orthologues to the mammalian ATRX gene). In this study, we found that mutations in the genes encoding the dXNP and dAdd1 proteins affect chromosome stability, causing chromosomal aberrations, including telomeric defects, similar to those observed in Su(var)205 mutants. In somatic cells, we observed that dXNP and dAdd1 participate in the silencing of the telomeric HTT array of retrotransposons, preventing anomalous retrotransposon transcription and integration. Furthermore, the lack of dAdd1 results in the loss of HP1a from the telomeric regions without affecting other chromosomal HP1a binding sites; mutations in dxnp also affected HP1a localization but not at all telomeres, suggesting a specialized role for dAdd1 and dXNP proteins in locating HP1a at the tips of the chromosomes. These results place dAdd1 as an essential regulator of HP1a localization and function in the telomere heterochromatic domain.\n\nDetail, unit 3, 1,100 horsepower (hp) pump motor.

We showed that, after D. dadantii infection, the expression of the Arabidopsis BOS1 gene was specifically induced by the production of the bacterial PelB/C pectinases able to degrade pectin. This prompted us to analyze the interaction between the bos1 mutant and D. dadantii. The phenotype of the infected bos1 mutant is complex. Indeed, maceration symptoms occurred more rapidly in the bos1 mutant than in the wild type parent but at a later stage of infection, a necrosis developed around the inoculation site that provoked a halt in the progression of the maceration. This necrosis became systemic and spread throughout the whole plant, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed in some lesion mimic mutants. In accordance with the progression of maceration symptoms, bacterial population began to grow more rapidly in the bos1 mutant than in the wild type plant but, when necrosis appeared in the bos1 mutant, a reduction in bacterial population was observed. From the plant side, this complex interaction between D. dadantii and its host includes an early plant defence response that comprises reactive oxygen species (ROS) production accompanied by the reinforcement of the plant cell wall by protein cross-linking. At later timepoints, another plant defence is raised by the death of the plant cells surrounding the inoculation site. This plant cell death appears to constitute an efficient defence mechanism induced by D. dadantii during Arabidopsis infection.\n\nMitotic Mysteries: The Case of HP1.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiggins, Jonathan M G; Prendergast, Lisa\n\n2016-03-07\n\nThe role of Heterochromatin Protein-1 (HP1) during mitosis has been controversial. Two recent studies in Science and Developmental Cell, from Tanno et al. (2015) and Abe et al. (2016), suggest that the means of HP1 localization and its function at inner centromeres are altered in cancer cells with chromosomal instability. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, it has not been shown if and how HP-1Î³ contributes to immunity in vivo. Here we show that in mice, HP-1Î³ positively regulates the germinal center reaction and high-affinity antibody response to thymus (T)-dependent antigens by limiting the size of CD8+ regulatory T-cell (Treg) compartment without affecting progenitor B- or T-cell-development. Moreover, HP-1Î³ does not control cell proliferation or class switch recombination. Haploinsufficiency of cbx-3 (gene encoding HP-1Î³) is sufficient to expand the CD8+ Treg population and impair the immune response in mice despite the presence of wild-type HP-1Î± and HP-1Î². This is the first in vivo evidence demonstrating the non-redundant role of HP-1Î³ in immunity.

The mutant strain a924E1 showed a significant loss of viability at HP levels of 175 to 250 MPa at 20 Â°C compared with the parent strain. This strain also showed a significant loss of viability following heat treatment at 50-58 Â°C at 0.1 MPa. These results showed that the mutation caused a significant thermosensitivity as well as barosensitivity. The activation volume and activation energy values for the inactivation of strain a924E1 were equivalent to those of the parent strain. This suggested that the mechanism for the HP and thermal inactivation reaction of strain a924E1 was basically the same as that of the parent strain. Strain a924E1 showed no deficiency in growth and fermentation ability as well as auxotrophic property. Although the identification of the genetic sites of mutation introduced is underway, these phenotypes are favorable for the application of HP treatment and heat-assisted HP treatment on fermentation control.\n\nIsolation and Characterization of Mutants of Common Ice Plant Deficient in Crassulacean Acid Metabolism1[W][OA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCushman, John C.; Agarie, Sakae; Albion, Rebecca L.; Elliot, Stewart M.; Taybi, Tahar; Borland, Anne M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a specialized mode of photosynthesis that improves water use efficiency by shifting part or all of net atmospheric CO2 uptake to the night. Genetic dissection of regulatory and metabolic attributes of CAM has been limited by the difficulty of identifying a reliable phenotype for mutant screening. We developed a novel and simple colorimetric assay to measure leaf pH to screen fast neutron-mutagenized populations of common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), a facultative CAM species, to detect CAM-deficient mutants with limited nocturnal acidification. The isolated CAM-deficient mutants showed negligible net dark CO2 uptake compared with wild-type plants following the imposition of salinity stress. The mutants and wild-type plants accumulated nearly comparable levels of sodium in leaves, but the mutants grew more slowly than the wild-type plants. The mutants also had substantially reduced seed set and seed weight relative to wild type under salinity stress. Carbon-isotope ratios of seed collected from 4-month-old plants indicated that C3 photosynthesis made a greater contribution to seed production in mutants compared to wild type. The CAM-deficient mutants were deficient in leaf starch and lacked plastidic phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme critical for gluconeogenesis and starch formation, resulting in substrate limitation of nocturnal C4 acid formation. The restoration of nocturnal acidification by feeding detached leaves of salt-stressed mutants with glucose or sucrose supported this defect and served to illustrate the flexibility of CAM. The CAM-deficient mutants described here constitute important models for exploring regulatory features and metabolic consequences of CAM.

Recently, we showed that nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases (SFKs) induces chromatin structural changes. In this study, we identify KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1/TIF1Î²/TRIM28), a component of heterochromatin, as a nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 is induced by several tyrosine kinases, such as Src, Lyn, Abl, and Brk. Among SFKs, Src strongly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Nucleus-targeted Lyn potentiates tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 compared with intact Lyn, but neither intact Fyn nor nucleus-targeted Fyn phosphorylates KAP1. Substitution of the three tyrosine residues Tyr-449/Tyr-458/Tyr-517, located close to the HP1 binding-motif, into phenylalanine ablates tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Immunostaining and chromatin fractionation show that Src and Lyn decrease the association of KAP1 with heterochromatin in a kinase activity-dependent manner. KAP1 knockdown impairs the association of HP1Î± with heterochromatin, because HP1Î± associates with KAP1 in heterochromatin. Intriguingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreases the association of HP1Î± with heterochromatin, which is inhibited by replacement of endogenous KAP1 with its phenylalanine mutant (KAP1-Y449F/Y458F/Y517F, KAP1â3YF). In DNA damage, KAP1â3YF repressed transcription of p21. These results suggest that nucleus-localized tyrosine kinases, including SFKs, phosphorylate KAP1 at Tyr-449/Tyr-458/Tyr-517 and inhibit the association of KAP1 and HP1Î± with heterochromatin.

Although phosphorylation of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) family proteins regulates heterochromatin dynamics, its role in heterochromatin bodies remains unknown. We previously reported that dephosphorylation of the HP1-like protein Pdd1p is required for the formation of heterochromatin bodies during the process of programmed DNA elimination in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena Here, we show that the heterochromatin body component Jub4p is required for Pdd1p phosphorylation, heterochromatin body formation, and DNA elimination. Moreover, our analyses of unphosphorylatable Pdd1p mutants demonstrate that Pdd1p phosphorylation is required for heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination, whereas it is dispensable for local heterochromatin assembly. Therefore, both phosphorylation and the following dephosphorylation of Pdd1p are necessary to facilitate the formation of heterochromatin bodies. We suggest that Jub4p-mediated phosphorylation of Pdd1p creates a chromatin environment that is a prerequisite for subsequent heterochromatin body assembly and DNA elimination.\n\nArabidopsis thaliana ggt1 photorespiratory mutants maintain leaf carbon/nitrogen balance by reducing RuBisCO content and plant growth.\n\nPubMed\n\nDellero, YounÃ¨s; Lamothe-Sibold, MarlÃ¨ne; Jossier, Mathieu; Hodges, Michael\n\n2015-09-01\n\nMetabolic and physiological analyses of glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (GGT1) mutants were performed at the global leaf scale to elucidate the mechanisms involved in their photorespiratory growth phenotype. Air-grown ggt1 mutants showed retarded growth and development, that was not observed at high CO2 (3000Â Î¼LÂ L(-1) ). When compared to wild-type (WT) plants, air-grown ggt1 plants exhibited glyoxylate accumulation, global changes in amino acid amounts including a decrease in serine content, lower organic acid levels, and modified ATP/ADP and NADP(+) /NADPH ratios. When compared to WT plants, their net CO2 assimilation rates (An ) were 50% lower and this mirrored decreases in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) contents. High CO2 -grown ggt1 plants transferred to air revealed a rapid decrease of An and photosynthetic electron transfer rate while maintaining a high energetic state. Short-term (a night period and 4Â h of light) transferred ggt1 leaves accumulated glyoxylate and exhibited low serine contents, while other amino acid levels were not modified. RuBisCO content, activity and activation state were not altered after a short-term transfer while the ATP/ADP ratio was lowered in ggt1 rosettes. However, plant growth and RuBisCO levels were both reduced in ggt1 leaves after a long-term (12Â days) acclimation to air from high CO2 when compared to WT plants. The data are discussed with respect to a reduced photorespiratory carbon recycling in the mutants. It is proposed that the low An limits nitrogen-assimilation, this decreases leaf RuBisCO content until plants attain a new homeostatic state that maintains a constant C/N balance and leads to smaller, slower growing plants.

E.; Carlson, Peter S.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nRibulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) was crystallized from a heterozygous tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) aurea mutant (Su/su), its wild-type sibling (su/su), and green revertant plants regenerated from green spots found on leaves of haploid Su plants. No differences were found in the specific activity or kinetic parameters of this enzyme, when comparing Su/su and su/su plants of the same age, which had been grown under identical conditions. The enzyme crystallized from revertant plants was also identical to the enzyme from wild-type plants with the exception of one clone, designated R2. R2 has a chromosome number approximately double that of the wild-type (87.0 Â± 11.1 versus 48). The enzyme from R2 had a lower Vmax for CO2, although the Km values were identical to those for the enzyme from the wild-type plant. The enzyme from all mutant plants had identical isoelectric points, identical molecular weight as demonstrated by migration on native and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, and the same ratio of large to small subunits as the enzyme from the wild-type. The large subunit of the enzyme from tobacco leaves exhibited a different electrophoretic pattern than did the large subunit from spinach; there were two to three bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for the tobacco enzyme whereas the enzyme from spinach had only one species of large subunit. Total polyphenol oxidase activity was the same in leaves from the heterozygous mutant (Su/su) and wild-type (su/su) plants when correlated with developmental age as represented by morphology rather than by the chronological age of the plants. There was a marked increase in the soluble activity of this enzyme with increasing age of both plant types and also as a result of varying environmental conditions. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity correlated inversely with increases in the soluble activity of polyphenol oxidase in crude homogenates from which the\n\nA Novel Two-Step Method for Screening Shade Tolerant Mutant Plants via Dwarfism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Wei; Katin-Grazzini, Lorenzo; Krishnan, Sanalkumar; Thammina, Chandra; El-Tanbouly, Rania; Yer, Huseyin; Merewitz, Emily; Guillard, Karl; Inguagiato, John; McAvoy, Richard J.; Liu, Zongrang; Li, Yi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWhen subjected to shade, plants undergo rapid shoot elongation, which often makes them more prone to disease and mechanical damage. Shade-tolerant plants can be difficult to breed; however, they offer a substantial benefit over other varieties in low-light areas. Although perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is a popular species of turf grasses because of their good appearance and fast establishment, the plant normally does not perform well under shade conditions. It has been reported that, in turfgrass, induced dwarfism can enhance shade tolerance. Here we describe a two-step procedure for isolating shade tolerant mutants of perennial ryegrass by first screening for dominant dwarf mutants, and then screening dwarf plants for shade tolerance. The two-step screening process to isolate shade tolerant mutants can be done efficiently with limited space at early seedling stages, which enables quick and efficient isolation of shade tolerant mutants, and thus facilitates development of shade tolerant new cultivars of turfgrasses. Using the method, we isolated 136 dwarf mutants from 300,000 mutagenized seeds, with 65 being shade tolerant (0.022%). When screened directly for shade tolerance, we recovered only four mutants from a population of 150,000 (0.003%) mutagenized seeds. One shade tolerant mutant, shadow-1, was characterized in detail. In addition to dwarfism, shadow-1 and its sexual progeny displayed high degrees of tolerance to both natural and artificial shade. We showed that endogenous gibberellin (GA) content in shadow-1 was higher than wild-type controls, and shadow-1 was also partially GA insensitive. Our novel, simple and effective two-step screening method should be applicable to breeding shade tolerant cultivars of turfgrasses, ground covers, and other economically important crop plants that can be used under canopies of existing vegetation to increase productivity per unit area of land.

The XNP/ATR-X gene encodes a DNA-helicase belonging to the SNF2 family. It has been proposed that XNP/ATR-X might be involved in chromatin remodelling. The lack of a mouse model for the ATR-X syndrome has, however, hampered functional studies of XNP/ATR-X. C. elegans possesses one homolog of the XNP/ATR-X gene, named xnp-1. By analysing a deletion mutant, we show that xnp-1 is required for the development of the embryo and the somatic gonad. Moreover, we show that abrogation of xnp-1 function in combination with inactivation of genes of the NuRD complex, as well as lin-35/Rb and hpl-2/HP1 leads to a stereotyped block of larval development with a cessation of growth but not of cell division. We also demonstrate a specific function for xnp-1 together with lin-35 or hpl-2 in the control of transgene expression, a process known to be dependent on chromatin remodelling. This study thus demonstrates that in vivo XNP-1 acts in association with RB, HP1 and the NuRD complex during development.\n\nMutation of charged residues to neutral ones accelerates urea denaturation of HP-35.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Haiyan; Yang, Lijiang; Gao, Yi Qin\n\n2010-09-16\n\nFollowing the studies of urea denaturation of Î²-hairpins using molecular dynamics, in this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of two peptides, a 35 residue three helix bundle villin headpiece protein HP-35 and its doubly norleucine-substituent mutant (Lys24Nle/Lys29Nle) HP-35 NleNle, were undertaken in urea solutions to understand the molecular mechanism of urea denaturation of Î±-helices. The mutant HP-35 NleNle was found to denature more easily than the wild type. During the expansion of the small hydrophobic core, water penetration occurs first, followed by that of urea molecules. It was also found that the initial hydration of the peptide backbone is achieved through water hydrogen bonding with the backbone CO groups during the denaturation of both polypeptides. The mutation of the two charged lysine residues to apolar norleucine enhances the accumulation of urea near the hydrophobic core and facilitates the denaturation process. Urea also interacts directly with the peptide backbone as well as side chains, thereby stabilizing nonnative conformations. The mechanism revealed here is consistent with the previous study on secondary structure of Î²-hairpin polypeptide, GB1, PEPTIDE 1, and TRPZIP4, suggesting that there is a general mechanism in the denaturation of protein backbone hydrogen bonds by urea.\n\nBrassinosteroid-Insensitive Dwarf Mutants of Arabidopsis Accumulate Brassinosteroids1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNoguchi, Takahiro; Fujioka, Shozo; Choe, Sunghwa; Takatsuto, Suguru; Yoshida, Shigeo; Yuan, Heng; Feldmann, Kenneth A.; Tax, Frans E.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nSeven dwarf mutants resembling brassinosteroid (BR)-biosynthetic dwarfs were isolated that did not respond significantly to the application of exogenous BRs. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that these were novel alleles of BRI1 (Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1), which encodes a receptor kinase that may act as a receptor for BRs or be involved in downstream signaling. The results of morphological and molecular analyses indicated that these represent a range of alleles from weak to null. The endogenous BRs were examined from 5-week-old plants of a null allele (bri1-4) and two weak alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6). Previous analysis of endogenous BRs in several BR-biosynthetic dwarf mutants revealed that active BRs are deficient in these mutants. However, bri1-4 plants accumulated very high levels of brassinolide, castasterone, and typhasterol (57-, 128-, and 33-fold higher, respectively, than those of wild-type plants). Weaker alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6) also accumulated considerable levels of brassinolide, castasterone, and typhasterol, but less than the null allele (bri1-4). The levels of 6-deoxoBRs in bri1 mutants were comparable to that of wild type. The accumulation of biologically active BRs may result from the inability to utilize these active BRs, the inability to regulate BR biosynthesis in bri1 mutants, or both. Therefore, BRI1 is required for the homeostasis of endogenous BR levels.

Here we investigated the diffusional behaviors of HP1 isoforms in mammalian cells. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) we found that in interphase cells most HP1 molecules (50â80%) are highly mobile (recovery halftime: t1/2 â 0.9 s; diffusion coefficient: D â 0.6â0.7 Î¼m2 s-1). Twenty to 40% of HP1 molecules appear to be incorporated into stable, slow-moving oligomeric complexes (t1/2 â 10 s), and constitutive heterochromatin of all mammalian cell types analyzed contain 5â7% of very slow HP1 molecules. The amount of very slow HP1 molecules correlated with the chromatin condensation state, mounting to more than 44% in condensed chromatin of transcriptionally silent cells. During mitosis 8â14% of GFP-HP1Î±, but not the other isoforms, are very slow within pericentromeric heterochromatin, indicating an isoform-specific function of HP1Î± in heterochromatin of mitotic chromosomes. These data suggest that mobile as well as very slow populations of HP1 may function in concert to maintain a stable conformation of constitutive heterochromatin throughout the cell cycle.

The direction of auxin transport in stems is believed to result from the basal localization within cells of the PIN1 membrane protein, which controls the efflux of the auxin anion. Mutations in two genes homologous to those encoding the P-glycoprotein ABC transporters that are especially abundant in multidrug-resistant tumour cells in animals were recently shown to block polar auxin transport in the hypocotyls of Arabidopsis seedlings. Here we show that the mdr mutants display faster and greater gravitropism and enhanced phototropism instead of the impaired curvature development expected in mutants lacking polar auxin transport. We find that these phenotypes result from a disruption of the normal accumulation of PIN1 protein along the basal end of hypocotyl cells associated with basipetal auxin flow. Lateral auxin conductance becomes relatively larger as a result, enhancing the growth differentials responsible for tropic responses.\n\nData Transfers Among the HP-75, HP-86, and HP-9845 Microcomputers.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAD-A139 438 DAT TRANSFERS AMONG THE HP-75 HP-86 AND HP-9845 / MICROCOMPUTENS(U) AIR FORCE INST OF TECH WNIOHT-PATTERSON AFN OH D P CONNOR 1983...hereafter called the ඓ\") and the HP-86 (hereafter called the ඞ\").

However, the mechanisms regulating the dynamic behavior of HP1 are poorly understood. In this study, the role of Aurora-B was investigated with respect to the dynamic behavior of HP1Î±. Mammalian Aurora-B, AIM-1, colocalizes with HP1Î± to the heterochromatin in G2. Depletion of Aurora-B/AIM-1 inhibited dissociation of HP1Î± from the chromosome arms at the G2âM transition. In addition, depletion of INCENP led to aberrant cellular localization of Aurora-B/AIM-1, but it did not affect heterochromatin targeting of HP1Î±. It was proposed in the binary switch hypothesis that phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 negatively regulates the binding of HP1Î± to the adjacent methylated Lys-9. However, Aurora-B/AIM-1-mediated phosphorylation of H3 induced dissociation of the HP1Î± chromodomain but not of the intact protein in vitro, indicating that the center and/or C-terminal domain of HP1Î± interferes with the effect of H3 phosphorylation on HP1Î± dissociation. Interestingly, Lys-9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 is abnormally localized together along the metaphase chromosome arms in Aurora-B/AIM-1âdepleted cells. In conclusion, these results showed that Aurora-B/AIM-1 is necessary for regulated histone modifications involved in binding of HP1Î± by the N terminus of histone H3 during mitosis.

The development and activity of chloroplasts may differ in cotyledons that initially serve as a storage organ and true leaves whose primary function is photosynthesis. A genetic screen was used for the identification of genes that affect selectively chloroplast function in cotyledons of Arabidopsis thaliana. Several mutants exhibiting pale cotyledons and green true leaves were isolated and dubbed snowy cotyledon (sco). One of the mutants, sco1, was characterized in more detail. The mutated gene was identified using map-based cloning. The mutant contains a point mutation in a gene encoding the chloroplast elongation factor G, leading to an amino acid exchange within the predicted 70S ribosome-binding domain. The mutation results in a delay in the onset of germination. At this early developmental stage embryos still contain undifferentiated proplastids, whose proper function seems necessary for seed germination. In light-grown sco1 seedlings the greening of cotyledons is severely impaired, whereas the following true leaves develop normally as in wild-type plants. Despite this apparent similarity of chloroplast development in true leaves of mutant and wild-type plants various aspects of mature plant development are also affected by the sco1 mutation such as the onset of flowering, the growth rate, and seed production. The onset of senescence in the mutant and the wild-type plants occurs, however, at the same time, suggesting that in the mutant this particular developmental step does not seem to suffer from reduced protein translation efficiency in chloroplasts.\n\nMutant maize variety containing the glt1-1 allele\n\nDOEpatents\n\nNelson, O.E.; Pan, D.\n\n1994-07-19\n\nA maize plant has in its genome a non-mutable form of a mutant allele designated vitX-8132.

A single-point mutation in the DER1 (deformed root hairs1) locus located in the sequence of ACTIN2, a gene for major actin in vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana, leads to impaired root hair development (Ringli C, Baumberger N, Diet A, Frey B, Keller B. 2002. ACTIN2 is essential for bulge site selection and tip growth during root hair development of Arabidopsis. Plant Physiology129: 1464-1472). Only root hair phenotypes have been described so far in der1 mutants, but here we demonstrate obvious aberrations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and overall plant development. Organization of the actin cytoskeleton in epidermal cells of cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots was studied qualitatively and quantitatively by live-cell imaging of transgenic lines carrying the GFP-FABD2 fusion protein and in fixed cells after phalloidin labelling. Patterns of root growth were characterized by FM4-64 vital staining, light-sheet microscopy imaging and microtubule immunolabelling. Plant phenotyping included analyses of germination, root growth and plant biomass. Speed of germination, plant fresh weight and total leaf area were significantly reduced in the der1-3 mutant in comparison with the C24 wild-type. Actin filaments in root, hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells of the der1-3 mutant were shorter, thinner and arranged in more random orientations, while actin bundles were shorter and had altered orientations. The wavy pattern of root growth in der1-3 mutant was connected with higher frequencies of shifted cell division planes (CDPs) in root cells, which was consistent with the shifted positioning of microtubule-based preprophase bands and phragmoplasts. The organization of cortical microtubules in the root cells of the der1-3 mutant, however, was not altered. Root growth rate of the der1-3 mutant is not reduced, but changes in the actin cytoskeleton organization can induce a wavy root growth pattern\n\nLight-Induced Acclimation of the Arabidopsis chlorina1 Mutant to Singlet Oxygen[C][W\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRamel, Fanny; Ksas, Brigitte; Akkari, Elsy; Mialoundama, Alexis S.; Monnet, Fabien; Krieger-Liszkay, Anja; Ravanat, Jean-Luc; Mueller, Martin J.; Bouvier, Florence; Havaux, Michel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSinglet oxygen (1O2) is a reactive oxygen species that can function as a stress signal in plant leaves leading to programmed cell death. In microalgae, 1O2-induced transcriptomic changes result in acclimation to 1O2. Here, using a chlorophyll bâless Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (chlorina1 [ch1]), we show that this phenomenon can also occur in vascular plants. The ch1 mutant is highly photosensitive due to a selective increase in the release of 1O2 by photosystem II. Under photooxidative stress conditions, the gene expression profile of ch1 mutant leaves very much resembled the gene responses to 1O2 reported in the Arabidopsis mutant flu. Preexposure of ch1 plants to moderately elevated light intensities eliminated photooxidative damage without suppressing 1O2 formation, indicating acclimation to 1O2. Substantial differences in gene expression were observed between acclimation and high-light stress: A number of transcription factors were selectively induced by acclimation, and contrasting effects were observed for the jasmonate pathway. Jasmonate biosynthesis was strongly induced in ch1 mutant plants under high-light stress and was noticeably repressed under acclimation conditions, suggesting the involvement of this hormone in 1O2-induced cell death. This was confirmed by the decreased tolerance to photooxidative damage of jasmonate-treated ch1 plants and by the increased tolerance of the jasmonate-deficient mutant delayed-dehiscence2.

Analysis of sto1/nced3, an Abscisic Acid-Deficient but Salt Stress-Tolerant Mutant in Arabidopsis1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRuggiero, Bruno; Koiwa, Hisashi; Manabe, Yuzuki; Quist, Tanya M.; Inan, Gunsu; Saccardo, Franco; Joly, Robert J.; Hasegawa, Paul M.; Bressan, Ray A.; Maggio, Albino\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe have identified a T-DNA insertion mutation of Arabidopsis (ecotype C24), named sto1 (salt tolerant), that results in enhanced germination on both ionic (NaCl) and nonionic (sorbitol) hyperosmotic media. sto1 plants were more tolerant in vitro than wild type to Na+ and K+ both for germination and subsequent growth but were hypersensitive to Li+. Postgermination growth of the sto1 plants on sorbitol was not improved. Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed that STO1 encodes a 9-cis-epoxicarotenoid dioxygenase (similar to 9-cis-epoxicarotenoid dioxygenase GB:AAF26356 [Phaseolus vulgaris] and to NCED3 GB:AB020817 [Arabidopsis]), a key enzyme in the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway. STO1 transcript abundance was substantially reduced in mutant plants. Mutant sto1 plants were unable to accumulate ABA following a hyperosmotic stress, although their basal ABA level was only moderately altered. Either complementation of the sto1 with the native gene from the wild-type genome or supplementation of ABA to the growth medium restored the wild-type phenotype. Improved growth of sto1 mutant plants on NaCl, but not sorbitol, medium was associated with a reduction in both NaCl-induced expression of the ICK1 gene and ethylene accumulation. Osmotic adjustment of sto1 plants was substantially reduced compared to wild-type plants under conditions where sto1 plants grew faster. The sto1 mutation has revealed that reduced ABA can lead to more rapid growth during hyperionic stress by a signal pathway that apparently is at least partially independent of signals that mediate nonionic osmotic responses.

This ability is associated with tumorigenesis by A. tumefaciens, the ability of avirulent A. tumefaciens to inhibit tumorigenesis, and the ability to adsorb certain phages. A second class of chromosomal mutations affects tumorigenesis without altering the ability to attach to plant cells. The attachment of A. tumefaciens to plant cells was assayed by mixing radiolabeled bacteria with suspensions of tobacco tissue culture cells or freshly isolated Zinnia leaf mesophyll cells. Under the conditions of this assay, an avirulent Ti plasmid-cured strain attached to the same extent as the same strain containing pTiB6806. Six of eight avirulent mutants with Tn5 insertions in chromosomal DNA showed defective attachment, whereas two retained wild-type attachment ability. In contrast to the strains showing wild-type attachment, the attachment-defective mutants failed to inhibit tumorigenesis when inoculated onto Jerusalem artichoke slices before inoculation of a virulent strain and also showed a loss of sensitivity to two Agrobacterium phages. The loss of phage sensitivity appeared to be due to a loss of ability to adsorb the phages. Staining with Calcofluor indicated that the mutants retained the ability to synthesize cellulose fibrils, which have been implicated in the attachment process. Southern filter hybridizations demonstrated that each mutant contained a single Tn5 insertion, and genetic linkage between the Tn5 insertion in one mutant and the attachment phenotype has also been demonstrated.

Recently we were able to identify a Medicago truncatula mutant (mtha1-2) that is defective in the uptake of phosphate from the periarbuscular space due to a lack of the energy providing proton gradient provided by the symbiosis specific proton ATPase MtHA1 In order to further characterize the impact of fungal colonization on the plant metabolic status, without the beneficial aspect of improved mineral nutrition, we performed leaf ion analyses in mutant and wildtype plants with and without fungal colonization. Although frequency of fungal colonization was unaltered, the mutant did not show a positive growth response to mycorrhizal colonization. This indicates that nutrient transfer into the plant cell fails in the truncated arbuscules due to lacking expression of a functional MtHA1 protein. The leaves of wildtype plants showed clear metabolic responses to root mycorrhizal colonization, whereas no changes of leaf metabolite levels of mycorrhizal mtha1-2 plants were detected, even though they were colonized. These results show that MtHa1 is indispensable for a functional mycorrhizal symbiosis and, moreover, suggest that fungal root colonization per se does not depend on nutrient transfer to the plant host.\n\nEthnicity/culture modulates the relationships of the haptoglobin (Hp) 1-1 phenotype with cognitive function in older individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuerrero-Berroa, Elizabeth; Ravona-Springer, Ramit; Heymann, Anthony; Schmeidler, James; Hoffman, Hadas; Preiss, Rachel; Koifmann, Keren; Greenbaum, Lior; Levy, Andrew; Silverman, Jeremy M; Leroith, Derek; Sano, Mary; Schnaider-Beeri, Michal\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe haptoglobin (Hp) genotype has been associated with cognitive function in type 2 diabetes. Because ethnicity/culture has been associated with both cognitive function and Hp genotype frequencies, we examined whether it modulates the association of Hp with cognitive function. This cross-sectional study evaluated 787 cognitively normal older individuals (>65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes participating in the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline study. Interactions in two-way analyses of covariance compared Group (Non-Ashkenazi versus Ashkenazi Jews) on the associations of Hp phenotype (Hp 1-1 versus non- Hp 1-1) with five cognitive outcome measures. The primary control variables were age, gender, and education. Compared with Ashkenazi Jews, non-Ashkenazi Jews with the Hp 1-1 phenotype had significantly poorer cognitive function than non-Hp 1-1 in the domains of Attention/Working Memory (p = 0.035) and Executive Function (p = 0.023), but not in Language/Semantic Categorization (p = 0.432), Episodic Memory (p = 0.268), or Overall Cognition (p = 0.082). After controlling for additional covariates (type 2 diabetes-related characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, Mini-mental State Examination, and extent of depressive symptoms), Attention/Working Memory (p = 0.038) and Executive Function (p = 0.013) remained significant. Older individuals from specific ethnic/cultural backgrounds with the Hp 1-1 phenotype may benefit more from treatment targeted at decreasing or halting the detrimental effects of Hp 1-1 on the brain. Future studies should examine differential associations of Hp 1-1 and cognitive impairment, especially for groups with high prevalence of both, such as African-Americans and Hispanics.

T.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nHelicobacter pylori is dependent upon the production of the highly abundant and active metalloenzyme urease for colonization of the human stomach. Thus, H. pylori has an absolute requirement for the transition metal nickel, a required cofactor for urease. To investigate the contribution of genes that are factors in this process, microarray analysis comparing the transcriptome of wild-type H. pylori 26695 cultured in brucella broth containing fetal calf serum (BBF) alone or supplemented with 100 Î¼M NiCl2 suggested that HP1512 is repressed in the presence of 100 Î¼M supplemental nickel. When measured by comparative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), HP1512 transcription was reduced 43-fold relative to the value for the wild type when cultured in BBF supplemented with 10 Î¼M NiCl2. When grown in unsupplemented BBF, urease activity of an HP1512::cat mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild type, 4.9 Â± 0.5 Î¼mol/min/mg of protein (n = 7) and 17.1 Â± 4.9 Î¼mol/min/mg of protein (n = 13), respectively (P < 0.0001). In silico analysis of the HP1511-HP1512 (HP1511-1512) intergenic region identified a putative NikR operator upstream of HP1512. Gel shift analysis with purified recombinant NikR verified nickel-dependent binding of H. pylori NikR to the HP1511-1512 intergenic region. Furthermore, comparative real-time qPCR of four nickel-related genes suggests that mutation of HP1512 results in reduced intracellular nickel concentration relative to wild-type H. pylori 26695. Taken together, these data suggest that HP1512 encodes a NikR-nickel-regulated outer membrane protein.

Higher urease activities were observed in an hp0868 mutant (than in the wild type) in cells supplemented with nickel, suggesting that the HP0868 protein (herein named Mua for modulator of urease activity) represses urease activity when nickel concentrations are ample. The increase in urease activity in the Îmua mutant was linked to an increase in urease transcription and synthesis, as shown by quantitative real-time PCR, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting against UreAB. Increased urease synthesis was also detected in a Îmua ÎnikR double mutant strain. The Îmua mutant was more sensitive to nickel toxicity but more resistant to acid challenge than was the wild-type strain. Pure Mua protein binds 2Â moles of Ni2+ per mole of dimer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not reveal any binding of Mua to the ureA promoter or other selected promoters (nikR, arsRS, 5â² ureB-sRNAp). Previous yeast two-hybrid studies indicated that Mua and RpoD may interact; however, only a weak interaction was detected via cross-linking with pure components and this could not be verified by another approach. There was no significant difference in the intracellular nickel level between wild-type and mua mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest the HP0868 gene product represses urease transcription when nickel levels are high through an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism, thus counterbalancing the well-described NikR-mediated activation.

Identifying the specific genes that contribute to cognitive aging may aid in early diagnosis of at-risk patients, as well as identify novel therapeutics targets to treat or prevent development of symptoms. Challenges to identifying these specific genes in human studies include complex genetics, difficulty in controlling environmental factors, and limited access to human brain tissue. Here, we identify Hp1bp3 as a novel modulator of cognitive aging using a genetically diverse population of mice and confirm that HP1BP3 protein levels are significantly reduced in the hippocampi of cognitively impaired elderly humans relative to cognitively intact controls. Deletion of functional Hp1bp3 in mice recapitulates memory deficits characteristic of aged impaired mice and humans, further supporting the idea that Hp1bp3 and associated molecular networks are modulators of cognitive aging. Overall, our results suggest Hp1bp3 may serve as a potential target against cognitive aging and demonstrate the utility of genetically diverse animal models for the study of complex human disease.

Compared with the control strains, the screened mutant strains have unique properties such as genetic stability, rapid growth, lots of spores, and high protease activity. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) are used to analyze the DNA fingerprinting of HP300a and the control strains. There are 67.9% and 51.3% polymorphic bands obtained by these two markers, respectively, indicating significant genetic variations between HP300a and the control strains. In addition, comparison of HP300a and the control strains, the genetic distances of random sequence and simple sequence repeat of DNA are 0.51 and 0.34, respectively.\n\nMutations to essential orphan response regulator HP1043 of Helicobacter pylori result in growth-stage regulatory defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlekhnovich, Igor N; Vitko, Serhiy; Chertihin, Olga; Hontecillas, Raquel; Viladomiu, Monica; Bassaganya-Riera, Josep; Hoffman, Paul S\n\n2013-05-01\n\nHelicobacter pylori establishes lifelong infections of the gastric mucosa, a niche considered hostile to most microbes. While responses to gastric acidity and local inflammation are understood, little is known as to how they are integrated into homeostatic control of cell division and growth-stage gene expression. Here we investigate the essential orphan response regulator HP1043, a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of transcriptional regulators that is unique to the Epsilonproteobacteria and that lacks phosphorylation domains. To test the hypothesis that conformational changes in the homodimer might lead to defects in gene expression, we sought mutations that might alter DNA-binding efficiency. Two introduced mutations (C215S, C221S) C terminal to the DNA-binding domain of HP1043 (HP1043CC11) resulted in a 2-fold higher affinity for its own promoter by footprinting. Modeling studies with the crystal structure of HP1043 suggested that C215S might affect the helix-turn-helix domain. Genomic replacement of the hp1043 allele with the hp1043CC11 mutant allele resulted in a 2-fold decrease in protein levels, despite a dramatic increase in mRNA. The mutations did not affect in vitro growth rates or colonization efficiency in a mouse model. Proteomic profiling (CC11 mutant strain versus wild type) identified many expression differences, and quantitative PCR further revealed that 11 out of 12 examined genes had lost growth-stage regulation and that 6 of the genes contained HP1043 binding consensus sequences within the promoter regions (fur, cagA, cag23, flhA, flip, and napA). Our studies show that mutations that affect DNA-binding affinity can be used to identify new members of the HP1043 regulon.\n\nHP1Î± is highly expressed in glioma cells and facilitates cell proliferation and survival.\n\nPubMed\n\nLai, Xianliang; Deng, Zhifeng; Guo, Hua; Zhu, Xingen; Tu, Wei\n\n2017-08-19\n\nEpigenetic alteration plays critical roles in gliomagenesis by regulating gene expression through modifications of Histones and DNA. Trimethylation of H3K9, an essential repressed transcription mark, and one of its methyltransferase, SUV39H1, are implicated in glioma pathogenesis and progression. We find that the protein level of HP1Î±, a reader of H3K9me3 is elevated in cultured glioma cell lines and glioma tissues. H3K9me3 is also upregulated. Depletion of HP1Î± and SUV39H1 weakens glioma cell proliferation capacity and results in apoptosis of cells. Furthermore, we find that HP1Î± and H3K9me3 are enriched in the FAS and PUMA promoters, which suggests that upregulated HP1Î± and H3K9me3 contribute to cell survival by suppressing apoptotic activators. These data suggests that up-regulated HP1Î± and H3K9me3 in glioma cells are functionally associated with glioma pathogenesis and progression and may serve as novel biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of brain tumors.

Phosphorylation of histone H3 has been linked with mitotic chromatin condensation. During mitosis in vivo, H3 lysine 9 methylation and serine 10 phosphorylation can occur concomitantly on the same histone tail, whereas the influence of phosphorylation to trimethylation H3 tail recruiting HP1 remains controversial. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation of HP1 complexed with both trimethylated and phosphorylated H3 tail were performed and compared with the results from the previous methylated H3-HP1 trajectory. It is clear from the 10-ns dynamics simulation that two adjacent posttranslational modifications directly increase the flexibility of the H3 tail and weaken HP1 binding to chromatin. A combinatorial readout of two adjacent posttranslational modifications-a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark-establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions.\n\nCadmium-sensitive, cad1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are phytochelatin deficient.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHowden, R; Goldsbrough, P B; Andersen, C R; Cobbett, C S\n\n1995-01-01\n\nAn allelic series of cad1, cadmium-sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, was isolated. These mutants were sensitive to cadmium to different extents and were deficient in their ability to form cadmium-peptide complexes as detected by gel-filtration chromatography. Each mutant was deficient in its ability to accumulate phytochelatins (PCs) as detected by high-performance liquid chromatography and the amount of PCs accumulated by each mutant correlated with its degree of sensitivity to cadmium. The mutants had wild-type levels of glutathione, the substrate for PC biosynthesis, and in vitro assays demonstrated that each of the mutants was deficient in PC synthase activity. These results demonstrate conclusively the importance of PCs for cadmium tolerance in plants.

W.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA computer program has been written to provide an interface between the HP Series 200 desktop computers, operating under HP Standard Pascal 3.0, and the HP2250 Data Acquisition and Control System. Pascal 3.0 for the HP9000 desktop computer gives a number of procedures for handling bus communication at various levels. It is necessary, however, to reach the lowest possible level in Pascal to handle the bus protocols required by the HP2250. This makes programming extremely complex since these protocols are not documented. The program described solves those problems and allows the user to immediately program, simply and efficiently, any measurement and control language (MCL/50) application with a few procedure calls. The complete set of procedures is available on a 5 1/4 inch diskette from Cosmic. Included in this group of procedures is an Exerciser which allows the user to exercise his HP2250 interactively. The exerciser operates in a fashion similar to the Series 200 operating system programs, but is adapted to the requirements of the HP2250. The programs on the diskette and the user's manual assume the user is acquainted with both the MCL/50 programming language and HP Standard Pascal 3.0 for the HP series 200 desktop computers.\n\nUser Guide for the LORE1 Insertion Mutant Resource.\n\nPubMed\n\nMun, Terry; MaÅolepszy, Anna; Sandal, Niels; Stougaard, Jens; Andersen, Stig U\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLotus japonicus is a model legume used in the study of plant-microbe interactions, especially in the field of biological nitrogen fixation due to its ability to enter into a symbiotic relationship with a soil bacterium, Mesorhizobium loti.

The cev1 mutant has constitutive expression of stress response genes and has enhanced resistance to fungal pathogens. Here, we show that cev1 plants have increased production of jasmonate and ethylene and that its phenotype is suppressed by mutations that interrupt jasmonate and ethylene signaling. Genetic mapping, complementation analysis, and sequence analysis revealed that CEV1 is the cellulose synthase CeSA3. CEV1 was expressed predominantly in root tissues, and cev1 roots contained less cellulose than wild-type roots. Significantly, the cev1 mutant phenotype could be reproduced by treating wild-type plants with cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors, and the cellulose synthase mutant rsw1 also had constitutive expression of VSP. We propose that the cell wall can signal stress responses in plants.\n\nThe Arabidopsis Mutant cev1 Links Cell Wall Signaling to Jasmonate and Ethylene Responses\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEllis, Christine; Karafyllidis, Ioannis; Wasternack, Claus; Turner, John G.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBiotic and abiotic stresses stimulate the synthesis of jasmonates and ethylene, which, in turn, induce the expression of genes involved in stress response and enhance defense responses.

Among the genes regulating seed development and participating in oil accumulation is FUSCA3 (FUS3), a member of the plant-specific B3-domain family of transcription factors. To evaluate the role of this gene during seed storage deposition, three BnFUSCA3 (BnFUS3) TILLING mutants were generated. Mutations occurring downstream of the B3 domain reduced silique number and repressed seed oil level resulting in increased protein content in developing seeds. BnFUS3 mutant seeds also had increased levels of linoleic acid, possibly due to the reduced expression of Ï-3 FA DESATURASE (FAD3). These observed phenotypic alterations were accompanied by the decreased expression of genes encoding transcription factors stimulating fatty acid (FA) synthesis: LEAFY COTYLEDON1 and 2 (LEC1 and 2) ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 3 (BnABI3) and WRINKLED1 (WRI1). Additionally, expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, and FA modifications were down-regulated in developing seeds of the mutant plants. Collectively, these transcriptional changes support altered sucrose metabolism and reduced glycolytic activity, diminishing the carbon pool available for the synthesis of FA and ultimately seed oil production. Based on these observations, it is suggested that targeted manipulations of BnFUS3 can be used as a tool to influence oil accumulation in the economically important species B.Â napus.

Here, we report identification of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the 462-494 amino acid region of TRIM28 that overlaps with its HP1 binding site, HP1 box. GST-pulldown experiments revealed the interaction of the arginine-rich TRIM28 NLS with various importin Î± subtypes (Î±1, Î±2 and Î±4). InÂ vitro transport assay demonstrated that nuclear localization of GFP-TRIM28 NLS is mediated by importin Î±s, in conjunction with importin Î²1 and Ran.

The GL1 dominant mutant is the first chlorophyll-less mutant identified in crape myrtle. It was obtained from a natural yellow leaf bud mutation. We previously revealed that leaf color of the GL1 mutant is affected by light intensity. However, the mechanism of the GL1 mutant on light response remained unclear. The acclimation response of mutant and wild-type (WT) plants was assessed in a time series after transferring from low light (LL) to high light (HL) by analyzing chlorophyll synthesis precursor content, photosynthetic performance, and gene expression. In LL conditions, coproporphyrinogen III (Coprogen III) content had the greatest amount of accumulation in the mutant compared with WT, increasing by 100%. This suggested that the yellow leaf phenotype of the GL1 dominant mutant might be caused by disruption of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) biosynthesis. Furthermore, the candidate gene, oxygen-independent CPO (HEMN), might only affect expression of upstream genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism in the mutant. Moreover, two genes, photosystem II (PSII) 10âkDa protein (psbR) and chlorophyll a/b binding protein gene (CAB1), had decreased mRNA levels in the GL1 mutant within the first 96âh following LL/HL transfer compared with the WT. Hierarchical clustering revealed that these two genes shared a similar expression trend as the oxygen-dependent CPO (HEMF). These findings provide evidence that GL1 is highly coordinated with PSII stability and chloroplast biogenesis.\n\nMutant selection in the self-incompatible plant radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) using two-step TILLING\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKohzuma, Kaori; Chiba, Motoko; Nagano, Soichiro; Anai, Toyoaki; Ueda, Miki U.; Oguchi, Riichi; Shirai, Kazumasa; Hanada, Kousuke; Hikosaka, Kouki; Fujii, Nobuharu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRadish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus), a widely cultivated root vegetable crop, possesses a large sink organ (the root), implying that photosynthetic activity in radish can be enhanced by altering both the source and sink capacity of the plant. However, since radish is a self-incompatible plant, improved mutation-breeding strategies are needed for this crop. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a powerful method used for reverse genetics. In this study, we developed a new TILLING strategy involving a two-step mutant selection process for mutagenized radish plants: the first selection is performed to identify a BC1M1 line, that is, progenies of M1 plants crossed with wild-type, and the second step is performed to identify BC1M1 individuals with mutations. We focused on Rubisco as a target, since Rubisco is the most abundant plant protein and a key photosynthetic enzyme. We found that the radish genome contains six RBCS genes and one pseudogene encoding small Rubisco subunits. We screened 955 EMS-induced BC1M1 lines using our newly developed TILLING strategy and obtained six mutant lines for the six RsRBCS genes, encoding proteins with four different types of amino acid substitutions. Finally, we selected a homozygous mutant and subjected it to physiological measurements.

To explore the potential physiological role of HP1BP3, we have previously described an Hp1bp3(-/-) mouse model with reduced postnatal viability and growth. We now find that these mice are proportionate dwarfs, with reduction in body weight, body length, and organ weight. In addition to their small size, microcomputed tomography analysis showed that Hp1bp3(-/-) mice present a dramatic impairment of their bone development and structure. By 3 weeks of age, mice of both sexes have severely impaired cortical and trabecular bone, and these defects persist into adulthood and beyond. Primary cultures of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts from Hp1bp3(-/-) bone marrow and splenocytes, respectively, showed normal differentiation and function, strongly suggesting that the impaired bone accrual is due to noncell autonomous systemic cues in vivo. One major endocrine pathway regulating both body growth and bone acquisition is the IGF regulatory system, composed of IGF-1, the IGF receptors, and the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). At 3 weeks of age, Hp1bp3(-/-) mice exhibited a 60% reduction in circulating IGF-1 and a 4-fold increase in the levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. These alterations were reflected in similar changes in the hepatic transcripts of the Igf1, Igfbp1, and Igfbp2 genes. Collectively, these results suggest that HP1BP3 plays a key role in normal growth and bone development by regulating transcription of endocrine IGF-1 components.\n\nnip, a Symbiotic Medicago truncatula Mutant That Forms Root Nodules with Aberrant Infection Threads and Plant Defense-Like Response1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVeereshlingam, Harita; Haynes, Janine G.; Penmetsa, R. Varma; Cook, Douglas R.; Sherrier, D. Janine; Dickstein, Rebecca\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTo investigate the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis, we isolated and studied a novel symbiotic mutant of the model legume Medicago truncatula, designated nip (numerous infections and polyphenolics). When grown on nitrogen-free media in the presence of the compatible bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the nip mutant showed nitrogen deficiency symptoms. The mutant failed to form pink nitrogen-fixing nodules that occur in the wild-type symbiosis, but instead developed small bump-like nodules on its roots that were blocked at an early stage of development. Examination of the nip nodules by light microscopy after staining with X-Gal for S. meliloti expressing a constitutive GUS gene, by confocal microscopy following staining with SYTO-13, and by electron microscopy revealed that nip initiated symbiotic interactions and formed nodule primordia and infection threads. The infection threads in nip proliferated abnormally and very rarely deposited rhizobia into plant host cells; rhizobia failed to differentiate further in these cases. nip nodules contained autofluorescent cells and accumulated a brown pigment. Histochemical staining of nip nodules revealed this pigment to be polyphenolic accumulation. RNA blot analyses demonstrated that nip nodules expressed only a subset of genes associated with nodule organogenesis, as well as elevated expression of a host defense-associated phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene. nip plants were observed to have abnormal lateral roots. nip plant root growth and nodulation responded normally to ethylene inhibitors and precursors. Allelism tests showed that nip complements 14 other M. truncatula nodulation mutants but not latd, a mutant with a more severe nodulation phenotype as well as primary and lateral root defects. Thus, the nip mutant defines a new locus, NIP, required for appropriate infection thread development during invasion of the nascent nodule by rhizobia, normal lateral root elongation, and normal regulation of host defense-like responses\n\nProportionate Dwarfism in Mice Lacking Heterochromatin Protein 1 Binding Protein 3 (HP1BP3) Is Associated With Alterations in the Endocrine IGF-1 Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArad, Shiri; Le, Phuong T.; Bustin, Michael; Rosen, Clifford J.; Gabet, Yankel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHeterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3) is a recently described histone H1-related protein with roles in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.

Loss-of-function mutants for the gene encoding the plasma membrane-located BR receptor BRI1 are resistant to exogenous application of BRs, and characterization of this protein has contributed significantly to the understanding of BR signaling. We have isolated two new BR-insensitive mutants (dwarf12-1D and dwf12-2D) after screening Arabidopsis ethyl methanesulfonate mutant populations. dwf12 mutants displayed the characteristic morphology of previously reported BR dwarfs including short stature, short round leaves, infertility, and abnormal de-etiolation. In addition, dwf12 mutants exhibited several unique phenotypes, including severe downward curling of the leaves. Genetic analysis indicates that the two mutations are semidominant in that heterozygous plants show a semidwarf phenotype whose height is intermediate between wild-type and homozygous mutant plants. Unlike BR biosynthetic mutants, dwf12 plants were not rescued by high doses of exogenously applied BRs. Like bri1 mutants, dwf12 plants accumulated castasterone and brassinolide, 43- and 15-fold higher, respectively, providing further evidence that DWF12 is a component of the BR signaling pathway that includes BRI1. Map-based cloning of the DWF12 gene revealed that DWF12 belongs to a member of the glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² family. Unlike human glycogen synthase kinase 3Î², DWF12 lacks the conserved serine-9 residue in the auto-inhibitory N terminus. In addition, dwf12-1D and dwf12-2D encode changes in consecutive glutamate residues in a highly conserved TREE domain. Together with previous reports that both bin2 and ucu1 mutants contain mutations in this TREE domain, this provides evidence that the TREE domain is of critical importance for proper function of DWF12/BIN2/UCU1 in BR signal transduction pathways.

We hypothesized that homology-dependent DNA damage repair (HDR) may contribute to the loss of these repeats in fas mutants. To test this, we generated double mutants by crossing fas mutants with knock-out mutants in RAD51B, one of the Rad51 paralogs of A.Â thaliana. Our results show that the absence of RAD51B decreases the rate of rDNA loss, confirming the implication of RAD51B-dependent recombination in rDNA loss in the CAF1 mutants. Interestingly, this effect is not observed for telomeric repeat loss, which thus differs from that acting in rDNA loss. Involvement of DNA damage repair in rDNA dynamics in fas mutants is further supported by accumulation of double-stranded breaks (measured as Î³-H2AX foci) in 45S rDNA. Occurrence of the foci is not specific for S-phase, and is ATM-independent. While the foci in fas mutants occur both in the transcribed (intranucleolar) and non-transcribed (nucleoplasmic) fraction of rDNA, double fas rad51b mutants show a specific increase in the number of the intranucleolar foci. These results suggest that the repair of double-stranded breaks present in the transcribed rDNA region is RAD51B dependent and that this contributes to rDNA repeat loss in fas mutants, presumably via the single-stranded annealing recombination pathway. Our results also highlight the importance of proper chromatin assembly in the maintenance of genome stability.

The tomato genome was sequenced in 2012 and tomato is becoming very popular as an alternative system for plant research. Among many varieties of tomato, Micro-Tom has been recognized as a model cultivar for tomato research because it shares some key advantages with Arabidopsis including its small size, short life cycle, and capacity to grow under fluorescent lights at a high density. Mutants and transgenic plants are essential materials for functional genomics research, and therefore, the availability of mutant resources and methods for genetic transformation are key tools to facilitate tomato research. Here, we introduce the Micro-Tom mutant database \"TOMATOMA\" and an efficient transformation protocol for Micro-Tom.\n\nThe WRKY transcription factor HpWRKY44 regulates CytP450-like1 expression in red pitaya fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus).\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Mei-Nv; Huang, Zi-Juan; Hua, Qing-Zhu; Shan, Wei; Kuang, Jian-Fei; Lu, Wang-Jin; Qin, Yong-Hua; Chen, Jian-Ye\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRed pitaya ( Hylocereus polyrhizus ) fruit is a high-value, functional food, containing a high level of betalains. Several genes potentially related to betalain biosynthesis, such as cytochrome P450-like ( CytP450-like ), have been identified in pitaya fruit, while their transcriptional regulation remains unclear. In this work, the potential involvement of a WRKY transcription factor, HpWRKY44, in regulating CytP450-like1 expression in pitaya fruit was examined. HpWRKY44, a member of the Group 1 WRKY family, contains two conserved WRKY motifs and is localized in the nucleus. HpWRKY44 also exhibits trans-activation ability. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of HpCytP450-like1 and HpWRKY44 increased steadily during pitaya fruit coloration, which corresponded with the production of elevated betalain levels in the fruit. HpWRKY44 was also demonstrated to directly bind to and activate the HpCytP450-like1 promoter via the recognition of the W-box element present in the promoter. Collectively, our findings indicate that HpWRKY44 transcriptionally activates HpCytP450-like1 , which perhaps, at least in part, contributes to betalain biosynthesis in pitaya fruit. The information provided in the current study provides novel insights into the regulatory network associated with betalain biosynthesis during pitaya fruit coloration.\n\nMua (HP0868) is a nickel-binding protein that modulates urease activity in Helicobacter pylori.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenoit, StÃ©phane L; Maier, Robert J\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA novel mechanism aimed at controlling urease expression in Helicobacter pylori in the presence of ample nickel is described. Higher urease activities were observed in an hp0868 mutant (than in the wild type) in cells supplemented with nickel, suggesting that the HP0868 protein (herein named Mua for modulator of urease activity) represses urease activity when nickel concentrations are ample. The increase in urease activity in the Îmua mutant was linked to an increase in urease transcription and synthesis, as shown by quantitative real-time PCR, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting against UreAB. Increased urease synthesis was also detected in a Îmua ÎnikR double mutant strain. The Îmua mutant was more sensitive to nickel toxicity but more resistant to acid challenge than was the wild-type strain. Pure Mua protein binds 2 moles of Ni(2+) per mole of dimer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not reveal any binding of Mua to the ureA promoter or other selected promoters (nikR, arsRS, 5' ureB-sRNAp). Previous yeast two-hybrid studies indicated that Mua and RpoD may interact; however, only a weak interaction was detected via cross-linking with pure components and this could not be verified by another approach. There was no significant difference in the intracellular nickel level between wild-type and mua mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest the HP0868 gene product represses urease transcription when nickel levels are high through an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism, thus counterbalancing the well-described NikR-mediated activation. Urease is a nickel-containing enzyme that buffers both the cytoplasm and the periplasm of Helicobacter pylori by converting urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The enzyme is the most abundant protein in H. pylori, accounting for an estimated 10% of the total protein content of the cell, and it is essential for early colonization and virulence.

After inoculation with the avirulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000 harboring the elicitor avrRpt2 (Pst-avrRpt2), melatonin levels in the snat knockout mutant lines were 50% less than in wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 plants. The snat knockout mutant lines exhibited susceptibility to pathogen infection that coincided with decreased induction of defense genes including PR1, ICS1, and PDF1.2. Because melatonin acts upstream of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis, the reduced melatonin levels in the snat mutant lines led to decreased SA levels compared to wild-type, suggesting that the increased pathogen susceptibility of the snat mutant lines could be attributed to decreased SA levels and subsequent attenuation of defense gene induction. Exogenous melatonin treatment failed to induce defense gene expression in nahG Arabidopsis plants, but restored the induction of defense gene expression in the snat mutant lines. In addition, melatonin caused translocation of NPR1 (nonexpressor of PR1) protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus indicating that melatonin-elicited pathogen resistance in response to avirulent pathogen attack is SA-dependent in Arabidopsis.

We examined the role of the immunity-related plant hormone jasmonate (JA) in the plant response and resistance to leafminer feeding to determine whether JA affects host suitability for leafminers. The expression of marker genes for the JA-dependent plant defense was induced by leafminer feeding on Arabidopsis wild-type plants. Analyses of JA-insensitive coi1-1 mutants suggested the importance of JA in the plant response to leafminer feeding. The JA content of wild-type plants significantly increased after leafminer feeding. Moreover, coi1-1 mutants showed lower feeding resistance against leafminer attack than did wild-type plants. The number of feeding scars caused by inoculated adult leafminers in JA-insensitive coi1-1 mutants was higher than that in wild-type plants. In addition, adults of the following generation appeared only from coi1-1 mutants and not from wild-type plants, suggesting that the loss of the JA-dependent plant defense converted nonhost plants to accessible host plants. Interestingly, the glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system may play at most a minor role in this conversion, indicating that this major antiherbivore defense of Brassica species plants probably does not have a major function in plant resistance to leafminer. Application of JA to wild-type plants before leafminer feeding enhanced feeding resistance in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and garland chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium). Our results indicate that JA plays an important role in the plant response and resistance to leafminers and, in so doing, affects host plant suitability for leafminers.
