Travel notes: For those who wish to schedule flights in and out of Chicago rather than Madison, there is bus service from the Chicago airport to the Wisconsin Union meeting site provided by the Van Galder Bus Company (9 departures per day; $17 per one way ticket). This service is not reserved for the meeting and this company does not accept reservations or advance ticket sales. Tickets are purchased at the airport. The time of our meeting is scheduled when there is unlikely to be a large demand on the bus service. The number to obtain the schedule is 608-257-5593.

For those flying from Boston, New York (LGA), Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Dallas, San Diego and Los Angeles to Madison, you might want to consider Midwest Express Airlines (800-452-2022) which provides first class service to all seats at regular fares. Detailed directions to the conference site from Madison and Chicago will be provided with a confirmation of receipt of registration materials.
