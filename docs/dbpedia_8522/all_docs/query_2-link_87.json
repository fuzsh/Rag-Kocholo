        "text": "WASHINGTON — Some call him a criminal, others say he’s a hero. Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, has taken a plea deal from the United States government, according to an AP report. The plea deal allows Assange to return to Australia.\n\nJulian Assange founded Wikileaks in 2006 and used it as a platform to share leaked documents and media with the world. Wikileaks has published large amounts of classified information, including the 2010 Chelsea Manning leaks. These leaks contained videos and documents from the Afghanistan war, leading to accusations of war crimes committed by the U.S. military.\n\nAfter Assange spent years in asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, he was arrested in 2019. He had remained incarcerated in London ever since, but has now left for Australia.\n\nAssange has long been a figure of controversy. He is both the winner of awards for journalism and the subject of criminal investigations and arrest warrants. Court documents reveal that Assange’s plea deal directly connects to the Chelsea Manning leaks.\n\nRelated:"
