        "text": "We constantly faced an evolving series of obstacles and in the end were the only NGO that managed to monitor all four and a half years of extradition proceedings in the UK courts, as well as the only NGO that gained access to Belmarsh prison, where I was finally able to visit Assange six times in recent months.\n\nRSF also engaged in extensive advocacy with the governments involved, and launched widespread public mobilization campaigns – anything we could do to help change the status quo.\n\nThreat to press freedom\n\nThe Espionage Act remains a threat to press freedom and must urgently be reformed to prevent it from ever being used again to target journalistic activity. Crucially, it must be amended to include a public interest defence. Those who have been wrongfully charged under this antiquated law should be pardoned, including Assange – whose record should be wiped clean, and Snowden – who should be allowed to return safely home to the US with his family without fear of imprisonment.\n\nAll those who care about press freedom must remain vigilant. This will not be the last time we see a Julian Assange – someone who tests our values, and our very democracies. There may one day be an even more complicated figure who calls into question what is journalism, what states should be able to keep secret, and what the public has the right to know.\n\nWe should all draw lessons from this experience and ensure greater solidarity and adherence to our principles no matter how imperfect the target in question may appear. Because it really is, ultimately, about all of our rights, and about what kind of world we want to live in.\n\nRebecca Vincent is the Director of Campaigns at Reporters Without Borders (RSF)."
