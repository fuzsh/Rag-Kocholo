        "text": "Julian Assange has arrived in Australia after walking free from an American court following a deal with US authorities.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to one criminal charge under the deal after fighting against extradition to the US, where he was accused of disclosing military secrets.\n\nWhat did Julian Assange do?\n\nMr Assange ran Wikileaks, a website that published many confidential or restricted official reports related to war, spying and corruption.\n\nIn 2010, it released a video from a US military helicopter which showed civilians being killed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nIt also published thousands of confidential documents supplied by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These suggested that the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe revelations became a huge story, prompting reaction from all corners of the globe, and led to intense scrutiny of American involvement in foreign conflicts.\n\nThe US said the leaks had endangered the lives of American personnel.\n\nMr Assange was accused of conspiring to break into its military databases to acquire sensitive information, and was charged with 18 offences.\n\nEfforts were made to bring him to the US for prosecution - which he fought for 14 years in some of the world's highest courts.\n\nMr Assange has always argued that he exposed serious abuses by US armed forces, and that the case against him was politically motivated.\n\nWho is Julian Assange?\n\nBorn in Australia, Mr Assange is described by those who have worked with him as intense, driven and highly intelligent, with an exceptional ability to crack computer codes.\n\nHe gained a reputation for computer programming as a teenager. In 1995, he was fined for hacking offences.\n\nHe also co-wrote a bestselling book on the emerging, subversive side of the internet, before studying physics and maths.\n\nWhat were the sexual assault allegations against Julian Assange?\n\nIn 2010 - the year Wikileaks released the footage of US soldiers shooting dead Iraqi civilians - the Swedish authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr Assange, accusing him of having raped one woman and molested another.\n\nThis marked the start of Mr Assange's 14-year legal battle.\n\nHe was detained in the UK and denied the claims against him, arguing that they were a ploy to extradite him to the US to face espionage charges over the Wikileaks disclosures.\n\nIn 2012, he claimed asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London - having found sympathy for his cause from the country's then-president.\n\nMr Assange spent seven years in the embassy, and was regularly visited by celebrity supporters including the singer Lady Gaga and the actress Pamela Anderson.\n\nWhen he was ordered to leave the building by a later Ecuadorean president, he was arrested by UK police, and went on to spend five years in a British prison as he continued efforts to fight extradition to the US.\n\nIn November 2019, the Swedish authorities dropped the case against Mr Assange because they said too much time had passed since the alleged offences.\n\nWhy has Julian Assange been released now?\n\nMr Assange's release from a UK prison comes after a deal under which he pleaded guilty to one charge under the US Espionage Act. He will spend no time in a US jail.\n\nMr Assange's supporters said the agreement was reached after intense diplomatic efforts and pressure from Australia. The country's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the case had \"dragged on too long\".\n\nThe hearing took place in the Northern Mariana Islands, an American territory in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nUS President Joe Biden had previously said he would consider a formal request to drop charges - a remark that was welcomed by Mr Assange's supporters, who cited his ill-health.\n\nMr Assange's wife Stella Assange suggested a \"breakthrough\" was finally reached after the UK High Court began to consider her husband's constitutional protections under the freedom of the press.\n\nShe told the BBC that she was \"elated\" about his release, but that it had been \"touch and go\" at times.\n\nWhat is Wikileaks and what else has it done?\n\nMr Assange's website, which he set up in 2006, claims to have published more than 10 million documents on all manner of topics.\n\nIt is currently led by Icelandic journalist Kristinn Hrafnsson.\n\nAs well as the revelations related to Iraq and Afghanistan, it published a leak of documents from movie studio Sony Pictures in 2015.\n\nIt also disclosed thousands of hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta, in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nTo its supporters, the whistleblowing website is a key player in exposing secrets governments and companies would rather keep hidden.\n\nBut those whose documents were exposed on the web argue it is a dangerous and reckless force."
