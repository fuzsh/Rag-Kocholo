        "text": "After Busby’s telephone time on the show expired, Stern added that the discipline he and other journalists face in prison “might be a preview of how the rest of society looks if antispeech authoritarians get their way.”\n\nHe explained that government officials, from the Pentagon Papers case to the Julian Assange prosecution to he TikTok ban, frequently attempt to use “security” as some kind of magic word that nullifies the First Amendment and provides a free pass for censorship and retaliation. But behind prison gates, the bar is far lower than on the outside, and officials often succeed in limiting free speech based on flimsy pretexts.\n\nStern also discussed the problems that outside journalists face attempting to report on prisons, including the inability to set up media visits or communicate with inmates through nonmonitored channels, and a court system so rigged against inmates that newsworthy lawsuits get dismissed over technicalities before they can be adjudicated and reported on. It leaves “a really big hole in journalism’s overall coverage of one of the institutions of government that probably needs oversight the most.”"
