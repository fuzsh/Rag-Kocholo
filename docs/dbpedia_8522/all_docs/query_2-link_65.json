        "text": "That's all for our live coverage of Julian Assange's return to Australia\n\nThanks for following today's updates.\n\nWatch: Assange reunited with wife\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrived in his native Australia to be reunited with his family today.\n\nHe flew into the country's capital Canberra following his release from a London prison.\n\nHe was met by his wife Stella in an emotional reunion, hugging and kissing her after emerging from the plane.\n\nSupporters of Assange joined press from Australia and abroad at Canberra Airport as he landed.\n\nYou can watch the moment Mr Assange arrived in Australia and was reunited with his wife Stella below...\n\nThe news conference is now over\n\n'Julian has to recover'\n\nExplaining why Julian Assange is not attending the news conference himself, his wife, Stella Assange, says he \"just arrived in Australia after being in a high-security prison for over five years and [on] a 72-hour flight\".\n\nShe says it is \"premature\" and Julian \"has to recover\".\n\n\"The fact is that Julian will always defend human rights, will always defend victims - that's just part of who he is,\" she says.\n\nAssange 'could be pardoned if press unite'\n\nStella Assange is now asked if she thinks her husband will be pardoned.\n\nShe says \"I think he will be pardoned if the press unite to push back against this precedent.\n\n\"It affects all of you and your future ability to inform the public and publish without fear.\"\n\nJournalists should realise 'danger' of this case, says Assange's wife\n\nStella Assange says the case against her husband should be a warning to other journalists and publishers.\n\nShe says it is a \"danger\" that the US was able to secure a conviction for \"newsgathering information that was true, that the public deserved to know\".\n\n\"That precedent now can and will be used against the rest of the press,\" she says.\n\nMrs Assange says it is in the interest of the press to change the current state of affairs by reforming the espionage act, increasing protections for journalists, and offering her husband a pardon.\n\n'No restrictions' to plea deal\n\nUS co-counsel Barry Pollack is asked about the terms of the plea deal.\n\nHe says \"there are no restrictions\" and \"no gag order\".\n\n\"He is going to be able to go back to whatever life he chooses to build with Stella and his family,\" he says.\n\nMr Pollack says a requirement of the deal was that Mr Assange did not spend any further time in prison.\n\n\"The US also agreed they would not bring any further charges for any conduct or newsgathering that occurred prior to the time of the plea,\" he adds.\n\nAssange's lawyer defends WikiLeaks founder against 'he's no hero' argument\n\nThe speakers are taking questions now, and one journalist says today's news reopens the debate about whether Julian Assange's leaks were right or wrong.\n\nHis critics are saying he is \"no hero\", the journalist says, asking what the response is to this \"fundamental claim\" against him.\n\nMr Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, says it was acknowledged in court today that there was \"no evidence of any actual harm\" caused by the leaks.\n\nShe says the public interest in publishing the information was \"clear\", as it included evidence of war crimes, the extent of civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, and torture across the world.\n\n\"To suggest this is not in the public interest... I don't understand the basis on which you could possibly suggest that,\" she says.\n\n'Somebody told me that freedom comes slowly'\n\nAsked about how she felt as her husband stepped on to Australian soil, Stella Assange says \"she was overcome by emotion\".\n\nShe says she heard crowds cheering and then embraced her husband.\n\n\"Julian needs time to recover,\" she goes on to say.\n\n\"Somebody told me that freedom comes slowly. I want Julian to have that space.\"\n\n'He needs time,' Assange's tearful wife says\n\nJulian Assange wife, Stella Assange, becomes tearful as she begins speaking.\n\nShe says her husband \"needs time\" before he speaks publicly, while thanking the Australian people \"who have made this possible\" and the opposition for \"also supporting his release\".\n\n\"It took millions of people,\" she says.\n\n\"It took people protesting on the streets for years, and we achieved it.\"\n\nThis is met with cheers in the room.\n\nStella says: \"You have to understand what he has been through, he needs time.\n\n\"He needs to recuperate - this is a process.\n\n\"Please give us space and privacy to find our space.\n\n\"Let our family be a family until he can speak again at a time of his choosing.\"\n\nShe says \"this case is an attack on journalism\" and \"should never have been brought\".\n\n\"Today, Julian is free,\" she adds.\n\nThis content is provided by , which may be using cookies and other technologies.
