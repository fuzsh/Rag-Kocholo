        "text": "(born 1971). Australian computer programmer and activist Julian Assange was the founder and public face of the media organization WikiLeaks, which generated international attention for publishing classified or otherwise privileged information.\n\nAssange was born on July 3, 1971, in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. As a teenager, he demonstrated an uncanny aptitude with computers. He became a noted computer hacker and in 1991 pleaded guilty to a host of cybercrime charges, but because of his youth he received only minimal punishment. Over the next decade, he traveled, studied physics at the University of Melbourne (he withdrew before earning a degree), and worked as a computer security consultant.\n\nAssange created WikiLeaks in 2006. Its first publication, posted to the organization’s Web site in December of that year, was a message from a Somali rebel leader encouraging the use of hired gunmen to assassinate government officials. The document’s authenticity was never verified, but the story of WikiLeaks and questions regarding the ethics of its methods soon overshadowed it. WikiLeaks soon published a number of other scoops. In 2007 it posted details about the U.S. military’s detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The following year its Web site was briefly shut down as a result of legal action in the United States, but mirrors of the site remained unaffected.\n\nIn 2010 WikiLeaks posted almost half a million documents—mainly relating to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While much of the information was already in the public domain, President Barack Obama’s administration criticized the leaks as a threat to U.S. national security. In November of that year, WikiLeaks began publishing an estimated 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables. Those classified documents dated mostly from 2007 to 2010, but they included some dating back as far as 1966. Among the wide-ranging topics covered were behind-the-scenes U.S. efforts to politically and economically isolate Iran, primarily in response to fears of Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. Reaction from governments around the world was swift. Many condemned the publication. Assange became the target of much of that ire, and some American politicians called for him to be pursued as a terrorist.\n\nAssange also faced prosecution in Sweden, where he was wanted in connection with sexual assault charges. (It was the second arrest warrant issued for Assange for those alleged crimes; the first warrant was dismissed in August 2010 because of lack of evidence.) Assange was arrested in London, England, in December 2010 and held without bond, pending possible extradition to Sweden. (Extradition means sending someone accused of a crime from one place to another, such as another country, for trial.) He was eventually released on bail, and in February 2011 a British judge ruled that the extradition should proceed, a decision that was appealed by Assange’s attorneys. In December 2011 the British High Court recommended that Assange’s extradition case be heard by the Supreme Court. This decision allowed Assange to petition the Supreme Court directly for a final hearing on the matter.\n\nIn June 2012, after his extradition appeal was denied by the Supreme Court, Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in London. He applied for diplomatic asylum on the grounds that extradition to Sweden could lead to eventual prosecution in the United States for actions related to WikiLeaks. Assange claimed that such a trial would be politically motivated and potentially subject him to the death penalty. In August Assange’s request was granted, but he remained confined within the embassy as British and Ecuadoran officials attempted to resolve the issue.\n\nDespite his confinement in London, Assange launched the WikiLeaks Party in 2013 as part of his effort to win a seat in the Australian Senate. His party, however, failed to capture any seats when the Australian federal election was held on September 7, 2013. In August 2015 Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation of three of the allegations against Assange, though they continued to pursue an investigation into the outstanding allegation of rape.\n\nIn 2016 Assange became an active player in the U.S. presidential election, when WikiLeaks began publishing internal communications from the Democratic Party and the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Assange made no secret of his personal hostility toward Clinton, and the leaks were clearly timed to do maximum damage to her campaign. Numerous independent cybersecurity experts and U.S. law enforcement agencies confirmed that the data had been obtained by hackers associated with Russian intelligence agencies. Assange, however, denied that the information had come from Russia.\n\nIn May 2017 Swedish prosecutors announced that they had discontinued their rape investigation into Assange, finding it impossible to proceed with the case with Assange protected at the Ecuadoran embassy in London. Even though the investigation was halted, he remained within the embassy.\n\nOn April 11, 2019, Ecuadoran President Lenín Moreno announced that his country had withdrawn diplomatic asylum for Assange. Moreno accused Assange of having violated “the rule of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states” as well as the terms that Ecuador had imposed upon Assange regarding his tenure in the embassy. Shortly after Assange’s asylum was revoked, British police entered the Ecuadoran embassy and arrested him. While Assange was no longer subject to investigation in Sweden, he was still wanted for failing to appear in British court. He was also the target of an outstanding extradition warrant from the United States for his alleged involvement in the hacking of a U.S. government computer."
