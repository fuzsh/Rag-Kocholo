        "text": "Julian Assange has been released from prison and has left the UK following negotiations towards a plea deal with the US authorities, WikiLeaks said.\n\nHere is the full statement from Wikileaks which was posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: “Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1901 days there.\n\n“He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.\n\n“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations.\n\n“This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible.\n\n“After more than five years in a 2×3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars.\n\n“WikiLeaks published ground-breaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people’s right to know."
