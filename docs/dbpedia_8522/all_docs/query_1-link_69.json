        "text": "Julian Assange—the founder of WikiLeaks, who has spent the past five years in a British prison awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. for trial under the Espionage Act—will at last be set free this week. And that is a good thing.\n\nI am not a fan of Assange, who, even if he is not a Russian asset, has certainly behaved like one for more than a decade. Some of his leaks have almost certainly resulted in the deaths of American agents and allies; others have disclosed CIA hacking techniques for the benefit of U.S. adversaries; a slew of Hillary Clinton’s emails—which he peddled as a middleman between Russian hackers and eager Western reporters during the 2016 presidential campaign—may have helped catapult Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nBut none of these deeds were what prompted the U.S. Justice Department to hit Assange with a 19-count indictment in 2018 (with revisions in 2020). If they had been, the merits of the case—and of the request for his extradition—would have been fairly cut-and-dried. Instead, he was charged, in the language of the Espionage Act, with “obtaining and transmitting classified information without proper authorization.”\n\nSpecifically, he received classified documents from then–Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning and put them out on the WikiLeaks website for the public to consume. Assange is not, by most standards, a journalist. But what he did in this case was nothing different from what many journalists do routinely. Not only that, but disclosure of some of Manning’s documents was definitely in the public interest.\n\nThat is why it’s a good thing the Assange case is over. If it had gone to trial and if he had been found guilty, journalists and editors of all stripes would have had reason to feel insecure about simply doing their jobs.\n\nAs is, righteous cause for paranoia hasn’t totally disappeared. The Assange case is over because he agreed to plead guilty to one of the 19 charges, and in turn, a judge agreed to consider the defendant’s five years in a British jail—much of it in isolation—as time served. In other words, history will still record that someone doing what journalists do was prosecuted under the Espionage Act. And this sort of prosecution could, under harsher circumstances, happen again.\n\nThis has almost happened before. In 2006 George W. Bush’s DOJ indicted two American Israel Public Affairs Committee analysts, Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman, under the Espionage Act for improperly receiving classified material from a Pentagon official named Lawrence Anthony Franklin, then sharing that information with others. At one point in the trial, the presiding judge, T.S. Ellis III, noted that under the prosecution’s logic, the law “applies to academics, lawyers, journalists, professors—whatever.” At first, Ellis agreed with the logic, but in the end, he dismissed it—and with it, the case—finding enforcement of the law capricious and arbitrary. (Franklin, the official who had leaked the classified information, was prosecuted. In the same way, Manning was prosecuted for providing the information to Assange—and, since Manning’s trial was in a military court, where the goal is to mete out discipline, not justice, the penalty was far more severe, though President Barack Obama commuted the sentence after an already-harsh seven years.)\n\nThe Manning case was quite different. A disgruntled private first class with access to secret documents, Manning provided Assange with evidence of abhorrent behavior by U.S. armed forces in the Iraq war—including video footage of helicopter pilots mistakenly killing two Reuters reporters. This was news of legitimate public interest. Years later, a senior official in the Defense Intelligence Agency told me, on background, that none of the material in Manning’s cache could have been said to damage U.S. security.\n\nOne of the 19 counts against Assange involved his helping Manning break into a computer holding particularly sensitive materials. This offense—conspiring to intrude into a computer containing classified information—was quite different from the other 18. In 2019 prosecutors dropped the 18 counts under the Espionage Act and asked that Assange be extradited simply for this one. I compared the tactic with indicting gangster Al Capone for income-tax evasion. It might have worked. But then, in 2020, for reasons never explained, they tacked back on the 18 counts—a development that, rightly, gave the British authorities pause.\n\nAll this said, it gives me no pleasure to elevate Assange to the status of First Amendment icon. A savvy Australian computer technician in the internet’s early days, Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 in Iceland as a clearinghouse for officials to leak classified information in the public interest, regardless of their nationality or ideology.\n\nHowever, something changed in 2010. That year, Assange told a Moscow newspaper that he had obtained compromising materials “about Russia, about your government and your businessmen.” Whatever those materials were, this was the last anyone heard of them. From that point on, WikiLeaks circulated thousands of U.S. government documents, many of them damaging or embarrassing—but nothing about Russia or any other adversary.\n\nIn 2011 a WikiLeaks staffer named James Ball resigned from the organization. He revealed, among other shockers, that a fellow staffer named Israel Shamir, one of Assange’s closest friends, had recently handed raw intelligence documents to the interior minister of Belarus, one of Russia’s main allies.\n\nIn 2012 Assange became the host of a television show on RT, the Kremlin’s main propaganda network.\n\nIn 2016 came the cache of files from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email—material that was provided, indirectly, by Russian hackers. WikiLeaks did not supply emails from her opponent Donald Trump’s campaign—even though its servers were at least as vulnerable to cyberintruders.\n\nIn 2017 Assange leaked an enormous cache of documents on U.S. tactics and strategy in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. They included the names of local informants; he released the documents without first redacting those names. Even some of his friends criticized him for this carelessness, but Assange shrugged it off, telling a reporter for the Guardian, “Well, they’re informants. So if they get killed, they’ve got it coming to them. They deserve it.”\n\nIt may also be worth noting that after Edward Snowden leaked a massive bundle of highly classified National Security Agency documents, it was Assange who arranged his escape plan. Assange bought Snowden’s plane ticket from Hong Kong to Moscow; his girlfriend accompanied Snowden on the flight. The former NSA analyst was meant to catch a connecting flight to somewhere in Latin America, but Assange advised him to stay put in Moscow—where he resides still, now as a Russian citizen, 11 years later.\n\nThe Assange chronicle was complicated by an unrelated controversy. In 2013 Swedish courts requested his extradition for a case accusing him of sexual molestation. In response, he took shelter in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he was granted asylum. He stayed in the embassy for seven years, after which the Ecuadorians ousted him. British police nabbed him as he tried to leave the country and put him in jail for evading a warrant. There he stayed for five years as authorities mulled Washington’s extradition request. (The Swedish one had, by this time, expired.)\n\nAssange, age 52, will now return to his native country of Australia, where he will live with his wife and two small sons. He has stayed mum on whether he will revive WikiLeaks or what else he might do. Intelligence services of several countries still see him as a potential asset or danger. His steps, whatever they may be, will not go unobserved."
