        "text": "Julian Assange, who was arrested Thursday in London, built a reputation as the renegade founder of WikiLeaks, known for rattling governments by leaking sensitive and confidential information.\n\nSome consider him a champion of government transparency and freedom of the press, while others have condemned him as a dangerous rogue who has undermined national security.\n\nHere is a look at some of the biggest leaks Assange and his organization have been behind since its founding in 2006:\n\nUS Army manual for Guantanamo prison camp\n\nDate: November 2007\n\nThe Leak: One of Assange and WikiLeaks first big releases was of a 238-page Army manual from 2003 on \"standard operating procedures\" for the Camp Delta prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe Revelations: The manual showed the Army had a policy of keeping some prisoners from Red Cross inspectors and holding new prisoners in isolation for two weeks to make them more compliant for interrogators.\n\nAssange arrested: Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, faces US hacking conspiracy charge\n\nRead the indictment: Grand jury indicts WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\n\n570,000 messages sent on 9/11\n\nDate: November 2009\n\nThe Leak: WikiLeaks published more than half a million pager messages sent within a 24-hour period around the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\nThe Revelations: The messages included exchanges from \"Pentagon, FBI, FEMA and New York Police Department\" officials. \"We hope that its entrance into the historical record will lead to a nuanced understanding of how this event led to death, opportunism and war,\" WikiLeaks said of the release.\n\nVideo of US helicopter fire killing civilians in Iraq\n\nDate: April 2010\n\nThe Leak: WikiLeaks published video footage from a 2007 U.S. Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad, Iraq, that killed at least nine men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver.\n\nThe Revelations: Army soldier Bradley Manning, a transgender woman who later became known as Chelsea Manning, was later arrested for the release of the video and other classified material about the conduct of the war and civilian deaths.\n\nAssange's legal past: WikiLeaks founder had a litany of legal issues before London arrest\n\n'I know nothing about WikiLeaks':Donald Trump has no comment on Julian Assange arrest\n\nIraq and Afghanistan war documents\n\nDate: July and October 2010\n\nThe Leaks: In 2010, WikiLeaks published a trove of classified documents about U.S. military action. It released more than 90,000 documents related to Afghanistan and later published more than 400,000 documents from the war in Iraq.\n\nThe Revelations: The documents included information about civilian deaths, the hunt for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and Iran's backing of militants in Iraq.\n\nState Department cables\n\nDate: November 2010 to September 2011\n\nThe Leaks: More than 250,000 unredacted U.S. diplomatic cables dating from December 1966 to February 2010 were released in the what was referred to as \"Cablegate.\"\n\nThe Revelations: Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the release \"an attack on the international community.\" The documents included verification that the U.S. had conducted secret drone strikes in Yemen, details of U.S. efforts to get information on United Nations representatives, a push by Saudi Arabia's royal family to have the U.S. strike Iran and a description of Russia under Vladimir Putin as a \"virtual mafia state.\"\n\nThe book he carried: Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, was holding Gore Vidal book during arrest\n\nPam Anderson: Anderson melts down on Twitter over Julian Assange's arrest\n\nStolen 2016 emails\n\nDate: July and October 2016\n\nThe Leaks: On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails and on Oct. 7, 2016, it released another 2,000 emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta.\n\nThe Revelations: The emails, which U.S. intelligence later determined had been stolen by hackers working for the Russian government, appeared to show that the DNC had favored Clinton over her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Among the damaging information in Podesta's emails was the news that then-acting DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile had given the Clinton campaign debate questions in advance.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, USA TODAY; The Associated Press"
