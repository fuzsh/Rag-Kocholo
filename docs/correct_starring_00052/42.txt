The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night is set to be shown at Liverpool’s Philharmonic Hall next month to mark the 60th anniversary of the film.

The black and white musical comedy will be screened on the Phil’s historic Walturdaw screen – the last surviving example in the world – on Tuesday, May 14.

It will be preceded by an organ introduction by the hall’s resident organist Dave Nicholas, who plays as the screen rises from the Phil’s stage, and will be introduced by Dr Michael Jones who is Reader in Music Industry Music at the University of Liverpool.

A Hard Day’s Night was premiered on July 6, 1964 – with the film’s northern premiere coming four days later at the Odeon in Liverpool’s London Road.

The Beatles and manager Brian Epstein flew into Speke airport to attend the screening and were given a reception at Liverpool Town Hall. An estimated 200,000 people lined their route from the airport to catch a glimpse of the band and filled Castle Street to see them on the Town Hall balcony.

The film, directed by Richard Lester and written by Liverpool-raised Alun Owen, was a smash hit and garnered two Oscar nominations, including one for best screenplay for Owen’s cheeky script which follows the band, and all their mischievous adventures, as they prepare for a televised performance.

Along with The Beatles, playing themselves, it also starred Wilfrid Brambell, Norman Rossington, John Junkin, Lionel Blair and a young Patti Boyd.
