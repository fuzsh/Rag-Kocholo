This is an original, linen-backed, Australian daybill theatrical movie poster from 1964 for A Hard Day's Night starring The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr), Wilfrid Brambell, Norman Rossington, John Junkin, Victor Spinetti, and Anna Quayle. Richard Lester directed the classic musical-comedy.

The poster measures 13" x 30" and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. The poster was in good to very good condition prior to restoration with pinholes from theatrical display and a few smudges. There was a 4" tear with some paper loss on the bottom left corner that was repaired during backing. The poster was folded at the time of printing but the folds are much less noticable after restoration.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black circles in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This extremely rare and collectible poster, printed in 1964 to promote the initial, Australian theatrical release of A Hard Day's Night, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
