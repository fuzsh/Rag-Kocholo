        "text": "I have never considered Richard Lester's breakneck-paced \"A Hard Day's Night\" a rock ‘n’ roll movie, but a superb comedy that also has great rock ‘n’ roll music, courtesy of the Beatles, circa 1964.\n\nOK, I confess to heresy: Once The Beatles began writing and recording songs too complex to properly be played \"live,\" they kinda lost me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I admire the technical artistry of \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\" yet prefer hearing John Lennon rip his vocal cords out on a scorching cover of Barrett Strong’s \"Money.\"\n\nAfter the 1959 death of Buddy Holly, American rock 'n' roll became the property of synthetic \"teen idols,\" groomed by record producers. Paul Anka did turn out to indeed be aware of the artist, but, hey, anybody seen Fabian Forte lately?\n\nThe Beatles took the energy of Holly and Gene Vincent and turned it back on us, in a fresh way. I remember the first time I heard \"She Loves You,\" on a car radio, in a Studebaker. I actually wondered if Holly had returned to the living!\n\nRock ‘n’ roll movies in the 1950s were mostly very low budget \"quickies,\" short on plot, kind of long on music. Usually they depicted the desperate struggle of teens trying to convince their elders rock ‘n’ roll would not cause them harm.\n\nThe end would be a sock hop-type dance, where Eddie Cochran, Ritchie Valens, Chuck Berry or Jimmy Clanton would mime (badly) to their hits. The adults got the message, and everybody rocked, especially the fly-by-night producers of those films.\n\nUnited Artists could easily have followed that path with the Beatles, but something told somebody these guys were just as special as everybody claimed they were special. Thanks to director Lester, who'd made his bones in lunatic British satire, \"A Hard Day's Night\" was a real motion picture. It also has perhaps the single best set of basic rock ‘n’ roll the Beatles ever gave us, in their early prime. What beats the pounding, joyous, \"I Should Have Known Better\"?!\n\nSince the boys were already way larger than mere mortals, it was smart to let them just be themselves, surrounded by first-rate British comedic actors, especially Wilfrid Brambell, as Paul's \"very clean\" old grandfather. Lester also employed Lennon's withering sarcasm and Ringo's somewhat sad, endearing face.\n\nSeeing \"A Hard Day's Night\" today, at my age, can be sweet and also quite brutal, in the memories it evokes. America had barely recovered from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the murder of John F. Kennedy. Vietnam was breathing down the necks of me and mine like a ravenous vampire.\n\nOf course, what hurts me most is seeing Lennon, when he was indeed the John Lennon. Although I played bass, and once owned a Hofner like Paul McCartney, Lennon was the band's beating heart of rock ‘n’ roll, in music and attitude. If Mark David Chapman ever gets parole, he best stay away from me — and millions like me!\n\nGeorge Harrison died, but at least of natural causes. He was called \"the Quiet Beatle\" and, in retrospect, was a far better guitarist than many of us once believed, after we’d been hit by the sensory overload of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Leslie West and Jimi Hendrix. George, it isn’t only your guitar that's weeping, trust me.\n\nIf you’ve never seen \"A Hard Day's Night,\" see it immediately and loudly, please! For those of us from a certain generation, it’s more than a mere nostalgia trip. It’s a bold, bracing and undeniable reminder of what the world could have been, before it went dark.\n\nWappingers Falls resident Larry Robinson has written film reviews and features for Westchester newspapers.
