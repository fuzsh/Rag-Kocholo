        "text": "Highest Rated: 96% Monsters, Inc. (2001)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Kronk's New Groove (2005)\n\nBirthday: Jun 20, 1952\n\nBirthplace: Affton, Missouri, USA\n\nAn endearing film, television and stage actor, John Goodman skyrocketed to leading man status on the strength of his meat-and-potatoes, regular-guy affability and easygoing charm. For eight years, he was a crucial part of the top-rated series \"Roseanne\" (ABC, 1988-1997; 2018), playing the title character's forthright husband and comic foil before taking over as the series lead of \"The Conners\" (ABC 2018- ) after Roseanne Barr was fired from her series following controversial remarks on social media. And while he enjoyed mainstream feature film success with the box office hits \"The Flintstones\" (1994), \"Monsters, Inc.\" (2001) and \"Evan Almighty\" (2007), he maintained an art house fan base as a perennial favorite in Coen Brothers movies like \"Raising Arizona\" (1987), \"Barton Fink\" (1991), \"The Big Lebowski\" (1997) and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000). Adept at any medium, Goodman thrived on the stage in productions of \"Waiting for Godot\" (2009) while returning to the small screen for the acclaimed drama \"Treme\" (HBO, 2010-13). His widely diverse roles throughout the years allowed the actor to display charm and menace - sometimes within the same role - making Goodman both an assured leading man and dependable character performer with broad audience appeal, wide range and a great deal of respect among peers.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n96% Argo\n\n95% The Artist\n\n93% Matinee\n\n93% Arachnophobia\n\n92% Inside Llewyn Davis\n\n91% Raising Arizona 90% 10 Cloverfield Lane\n\n90% Barton Fink\n\nPhotos\n\nJohn Goodman at arrivals for THE GAMBLER Premiere at AFI FEST 2014, The Dolby Theatre at Hollywood and Highland Center, Los Angeles, CA November 10, 2014.
