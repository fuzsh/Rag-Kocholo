        "text": "John Cena, a cornerstone of WWE, has established himself as a seasoned face in Hollywood. But this time, he became an overnight sensation for his unique Bollywood allegiance. The 16-time WWE champion attended the business mogul of India, Mukesh Ambani’s son’s wedding. Several viral video clips of the star-studded heavyweight ceremony saw Cena dancing his heart out with his iconic hand gesture. But the one photo that caught the Indian fans off guard was Cena posing beside the Bollywood king Shahrukh Khan. The Champ also expressed his overwhelming feelings about meeting SRK in a heartfelt tweet.\n\nDespite not starring in a Bollywood movie does that give away an early hint of Cena in B-town the next? Let’s explore the opportunities.\n\nDoes John Cena intend to enter Bollywood following a gala time in India?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nJohn Cena had a gala time at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s high-profile wedding. In a captivating Indian traditional attire, the 47-year-old entered the venue with a warm welcome from the Ambani family. The way he accumulated himself in the Indian culture and tradition blew fans away. The picture with the Bollywood heartthrob SRK was the cherry on top. Delineating the feeling, Cena wrote, “A surreal 24 hours. So grateful for the Ambani family for their unmatched warmth and hospitality. An experience filled with so many unforgettable moments which allowed me to connect with countless new friends, including meeting @iamsrk and being able to tell him personally the positive effect he has had on my life.”\n\nWhile Cena has never starred in Bollywood movies, the way he mentioned the profound impact Shahrukh has had on him depicted that he’s a keen Bollywood follower. Also, the Cenation leader will have added time to think about Bollywood as he’s stepping out of the squared circle perpetually soon. The heartbreaking retirement tour that began on Money in the Bank 2024 will come to completion during WrestleMania next year.\n\nMoving ahead, let’s see what Cena’s acting excellence can bring to the Bollywood table.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nJohn Cena as a top-notch big-screen player: Explained\n\nTo focus on Cena’s upcoming Holywood schedule, it’s pretty stacked up. The Hollywood A-lister is next set to star opposite Awkwafina in Paul Feig’s action comedy Jackpot!, which will be released on Prime Video on August 15th. Moreover, the filming of a second season of the Cena-led superhero series Peacemaker recently kicked off. Cena has the most crabby resting-scowl face when in the ring, but also a warm infectious smile and go-with-the-flow look which reflects his wide flexibility as an actor. Be it an intense drama, hardcore action, or wacky comedy, Cena can put himself in the shoes of any character with utter precision and dedication. Even as a villain, he oozed magnetism that drew the audiences to the box office. The Peacemaker star gifted around 20 blockbuster movies over the past few years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFrom his exceptional career in Holywood, it is pretty visible that Cena would be an asset for Bollywood and would become an overnight sensation if he considers exploring that new avenue.\n\nWhat’s your take on John Cena’s potential Bollywood allegiance?
