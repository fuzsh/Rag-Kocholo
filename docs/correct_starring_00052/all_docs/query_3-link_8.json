        "text": "Highest Rated: 98% Deadwood: The Movie (2019)\n\nLowest Rated: 7% I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)\n\nBirthday: Sep 11, 1959\n\nBirthplace: Alexandria, Minnesota, USA\n\nA journeyman character actor adept at playing oddballs and outsiders, John Hawkes emerged from relative obscurity with a prominent regular role on the critically acclaimed HBO series, \"Deadwood\" (2004-06). Prior to playing Sol Star, a Jewish immigrant who goes on to become mayor of a lawless town, Hawkes bounced around from series to series in several guest starring roles, while appearing in bit parts in feature films. But after \"Deadwood,\" which lasted only three seasons despite a strong following, Hawkes rose up the Hollywood ladder to become a respected and much-recognized onscreen presence. While not appearing on television or in film, Hawkes performed with his alternative country band, King Straggler, but his true talents were displayed on screen in roles like the put-upon brother of a washed up ballplayer in \"Eastbound & Down\" (HBO, 2009- ). By the time he delivered award-worthy performances in the indie dramas \"Winter's Bone\" (2010), \"Martha Marcy May Marlene\" (2011) and \"The Sessions\" (2012), Hawkes had developed into an in-demand character actor capable of performing a wide array of roles.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n98% Deadwood: The Movie 95% The Peanut Butter Falcon 94% Winter's Bone 91% End of Sentence\n\n91% The Sessions\n\n90% Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\n90% Lincoln\n\n90% Martha Marcy May Marlene\n\nPhotos\n\nJohn Hawkes THE SESSIONS, (aka THE SURROGATE), John Hawkes, 2012, ph: Sarah M.
