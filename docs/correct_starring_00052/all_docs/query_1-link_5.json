        "text": "John Junkin, who has died from lung cancer aged 76, was a gifted scriptwriter who made an important contribution to British comedy from the immediate postwar years to the early 1990s. With more than 1,500 shows to his credit - most notably the Morecambe and Wise series - he worked with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan, and scripted an award-winning Marty Feldman television special.\n\nAlthough also a serviceable actor, Junkin was a sadly ungifted manager of his own career and life. In the 1990s he alienated the BBC by ill-advisedly starting to sue the corporation, was separated from his wife, and complained that he could no longer make his way in a medium now dominated by marketing, rather than creative, people.\n\nLooking like a cross between a secondhand car dealer and an unfrocked bishop, and with a voice that owed a lot to cigarette smoking, the tall and bald Junkin saw himself as a jobbing actor whose writing gave him the independence to decline poor parts.\n\nFrom 1978, he turned out Morecambe and Wise scripts, with Barry Cryer, while carrying on with his own acting work, often as a policeman or a crook. He also wrote Christmas specials for Eric and Ernie - an art form which attracted many and various celebrities for guest appearances, including the then prime minister, Harold Wilson.\n\nJunkin was given several of his own shows, some of them with considerable appeal. The programme simply called Junkin, for Southern Television in the early 1970s, involved inviting a hundred women into the studio and enabling some of them to do something they had always secretly wanted to do - such as throwing custard pies at Wilson and Edward Heath, by now the prime minister. Neither man seemed inclined to play; so the women were presented with two lifelike dummies instead.\n\nThere was something of Junkin's own background in the parts he played in films and on television, and in his humour as a scriptwriter. He was born in Ealing, west London, the son of a policeman, and taught in an East End school for three years, ending up hating it. He liked the children but detested teachers and the education department \"bores\". Fortunately for him, he was still living at home at the age of 25, and his parents allowed him to be what he called a \"butterfly\" for six months, during which time he tried to write for radio.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he teamed up with Dr Who author Terry Nation to write a BBC radio series which featured a large number of popular performers, including Anthony Newley, Elsie and Doris Waters, Ronnie Barker, Joan Sims and Hugh Paddick. Then, in 1960, Harry H Corbett, who played young Harold in Steptoe and Son, introduced him to Joan Littlewood and her radical Theatre Workshop in Stratford, east London. The institution appealed to his anarchical temperament; and his strong presence in sometimes dodgy authority roles was noticed by the critics. The secret of survival for him was, he said, surviving as an actor - and in that pursuit he was prepared to \"play Hamlet, walk the high wire, try anything\".\n\nBy the mid-1970s he was one of the busiest men in British television, teaming up with writing partner Tim Brooke-Taylor for the BBC series The Rough with the Smooth, in which he played the rough diamond flatmate to Brooke-Taylor's smoothie. At the same time, he was working on a series featuring Dorothy L Sayers' fictional upper-crust private detective Lord Peter Wimsey; acting as a jewel thief in a television play about gentlemanly thief Raffles; playing what he called a \"Hughie Green type\" (after the game-show host of that era) in a BBC education programme; chairing a quiz show for BBC Radio 2 and appearing in his own radio programme, later transferred to television, Hello Cheeky.\n\nThe comedian Marty Feldman won the Golden Rose of Montreux Award with a Junkin script in 1972, and its author worked regularly for top funny men Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Eric Sykes, Leslie Crowther, Jim Davidson, Mike Yarwood and Bob Monkhouse.\n\nAs an actor, Junkin played Alf Garnett's milkman in the series Till Death Us Do Part, a boozy husband in Sam and Janet with Joan Sims, a building foreman in On The House. Film appearances included the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night (1964), Wombling Free (1977) and A Handful of Dust (1988).\n\nThroughout his most active period, when Junkin's way with a show was to work on it throughout the night if necessary, he was regarded as a hardened bachelor, having brief relationships with many women. But he met a public relations executive 18 years his junior called Jennie when he was 47, while recording one of the Hello Cheeky programmes in Leeds. They married, lived in a house overlooking Hampstead Heath, and had a daughter, Annabel, to whom Junkin remained devoted.\n\nDisaster then struck. Work tailed off, his family life became difficult; by 1997 he was applying for a job as script editor with the BBC and not getting even a reply. He began denouncing the \"suits\" who had taken over television; his wife had asked for a separation in 1992 and he began to live alone again. Two years before, he had fallen out with the producer of a game show he had devised, threatened to sue him and found himself facing bills of Â£70,000 - on top of large sums of money he owed the Inland Revenue. In one year, he worked for only four days.\n\nThough he claimed he was not bitter, he had some reason to be, for he had made an undeniably joyous contribution to British comedy over a very long period of effortful creativity."
