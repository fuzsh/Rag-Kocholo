        "text": "Warren Beatty and Susannah York star in this crime comedy about a slick American card shark who is strong-armed by Scotland Yard into using his skills to help bring down a notorious criminal. Considering the people involved, it’s a surprise this film is as dull it is; Beatty and York have good chemistry, but even they can’t make up for dodgy pacing and a complete lack of energy that drags each scene out to breaking point.\n\nA globetrotting caper like this should’ve been a surefire hit along the lines of Gambit from the same year, but I think this just doesn’t capitalise on its strengths enough to be anywhere near as fun as that film. The first forty minutes are…\n\nIt's sort of Casino Royale with Warren Beatty as our Bond stand-in. Beatty plays a card cheat who is coerced by Scotland Yard into a plot to bankrupt an international drug dealer (Eric Porter) in a high stakes poker game.\n\nBeatty does his usual schtick of squinting and looking confused, but gets a fun cat burglar-style scene, punches some guys, and executes a hilariously timed spit take. A big part of the plot hinges on his ability to visually discern tiny details that I was never able to pick up on, not even once. Porter brought some fun and menace to the villain role. Susannah York plays Beatty's love interest and all I can say is she got a lot…\n\nHere’s that man again going on and on about some piece of fluff. I like Kaleidoscope because I have a weakness for caper movies, films set in London in the 60s, and Susannah York. As un film de Jack Smight, it is sluggishly directed, with several scenes running on much too long. During some of the card games, it is not quite clear what is going on. Still, I enjoy this sort of thing.\n\nWarren Beatty squints and pauses during almost every sentence. In earlier Beatty movies, longtime New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther accused Beatty of doing nothing but mumbling and picking his nose which led to Beatty’s telling Crowther what he thought of him in a restaurant which…\n\nWow, I didn't think I could find a movie I liked less in the same night as Sex in Chains, but I did it... congratulations to me, I guess?\n\nBelieve me when I say I wouldn't be able to explain anything about the second half of Kaleidoscope even if I wanted to; I really underestimated my general apathy toward movies about card games. Warren Beatty devises a method to see through cards without any special eyewear but wears glasses at the tables anyway? A gay-coded, proto-Dr. Evil guy named Dominion stole a bunch of morphine during WWII and used the money to open his casino? \"Shake\" from A Hard Day's Night (John Junkin) and the hired killer in Dial M…\n\nKaleidoscope begins as a meandering romance and quickly morphs into an espionage film. The tonal switch is not only jarring but badly mismanaged the balance with a weird underlying comedic tone that makes the whole thing feel cheap. It's implausible and wickedly dumbed down. There's also a need for a director with vision rather than going from scene to scene on a whim. Nothing in this film feels purposefully done and that's a problem. Whether it's operating in comedy, sabotage, or romance, there's no way to tell with badly executed visual storytelling.\n\nFurthermore, Warren Beatty is wrong for this role. He's got the laid-back personality but he's not suave. He's better at playing the simpleton. His comedy comes out of…\n\nThis is one of those charming romantic heist-like films that had their moment of popularity back in the 1960s. Films like Gambit, How to Steal a Million, The Italian Job, $ (Dollars) and Oceans 11. Light on their feet and not to be taken too seriously. There was no violence in them and the ladies were lovely. The men too with Peter O'Toole, Michael Caine and the Rat Pack. And Warren Beatty who stars in this one with Susanna York. York was pop hot at the time - part of the London scene of Carnaby and Twiggy. Beatty was a legend in the making - Bonnie and Clyde cemented that the following year. York goes ditzy here and Beatty is…\n\nKaleidoscope is not a particularly well-remembered movie. If it has any legacy, it's as an emblem of just how poorly Warren Beatty's career was going before he reinvented himself with Bonnie and Clyde. Indeed, Kaleidoscope is pretty lousy. The film is part of a trend of swinging London movies that clearly wants to be hip and cool, but is too stiff in its filmmaking to hit the mark. No amount of trippy transitions or sitars on the soundtrack can disguise how unremarkable and dull the story and direction are. The film also just takes forever to get going. It does eventually pick-up when Beatty's card cheat is pitted against the drug-smuggling villain. Director Jack Smight seems a bit more at…\n\nThe 1960s, Pt. II: 15/100\n\n1966 Ranked\n\nIn 1966, director Jack Smight had two films released. In February, the Paul Newman starring Harper hit theaters. A success upon release and still heralded as a good example of neo-noir, PI tropes, and a good showcase for Newman, Harper is certainly the stronger of the two films. In fact, it may be the best film Smight directed and one that, after a recent re-visit, had grown considerably in my eyes. There is a subtle layer of depth, especially in the characters, that nicely reveal themselves on rewatches, which exemplifies the staying power Harper has had. It even had a sequel released a decade later with The Drowning Pool. In September of ‘66,…"
