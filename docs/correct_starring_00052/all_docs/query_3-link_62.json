        "text": "Lionsgate has officially acquired the rights to the highly anticipated musical comedy ‘Power Ballad,’ directed by the acclaimed John Carney. The film stars Hollywood heavyweights Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas in leading roles and promises to captivate audiences with its unique blend of musical charm and comedic narrative.\n\nHaving just completed production in Dublin, ‘Power Ballad’ is set to deliver a refreshing take on the musical genre. John Carney, known for his exceptional work on ‘Sing Street’ and ‘Once,’ directs the film. The plot revolves around the characters played by Rudd, a wedding singer, and Jonas, a struggling pop star. The two characters join forces unexpectedly to create a song, leading to a series of hilariously unpredictable outcomes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAdam Fogelson, chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, expressed his enthusiasm about acquiring the film. “I’ve always been a huge fan of John’s movies, and I’ve had my eye on this particular film for some time. It combines the best of John’s immense creative talents with a marketable concept and an incredible cast. I couldn’t be happier that he and the rest of the team have entrusted us with it,” Fogelson stated.\n\nThe film is produced by Anthony Bregman’s Likely Story and financed by 30WEST in collaboration with Screen Ireland. Executive producers include Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan from Treasure Entertainment, adding further depth to the film’s production team. This project marks a reunion for Carney with his production partners from his previous work, ‘Flora and Son.’\n\nJohn Carney, who co-wrote the script with Peter McDonald, expressed his excitement about finding the right distributor for his passion project. “I am so delighted this film, which has been in my heart for so long, has found its home,” Carney said in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe distribution deal for ‘Power Ballad’ was facilitated by Lionsgate executives Charlotte Koh and Lauren Bixby. Domestic sales were managed by 30WEST, WME Independent, and UTA Independent Film Group, while WME Independent handled international rights.\n\n‘Power Ballad’ is set to bring Carney’s signature blend of music and storytelling to audiences in North America, the UK, and Ireland under Lionsgate’s distribution. This acquisition ensures that Carney’s vision will reach a wide audience, promising a delightful cinematic experience filled with music, humor, and heart."
