        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nWhen A Hard Day’s Night was reissued to theaters in 2000, I went with a friend to see it at a local art house and afterward as we stood chatting on the sidewalk I noticed that all the muscles in my face were sore; with a pleasant jolt I realized I had just been smiling continuously for 90 minutes.\n\nAlthough I had seen the movie numerous times before on television and home video, I don’t think I recognized until that night just how special a picture A Hard Day’s Night really is. Perhaps this is because I was a child of three when it first hit theaters and up to that evening had never experienced it on a big movie screen.* Despite what the pushers of ever-shrinking visual popular culture who wish you to become accustomed to downloading and looking at movies on cell ‘phone screens roughly analogous to the average Post-It Note would have you believe, the size and quality of the medium on and the venue in which you view a motion picture does make a difference, as does seeing it with an audience of people responding to it as you are, whether with laughter, tears or bleats of terror. (Even rapt, silent contemplation of a picture’s charm or beauty, experienced with others, can be communicable.) When people who know movies say, as Roger Ebert did, that the pleasure received from, and the overall greatness of, A Hard Day’s Night are comparable to those of Singin’ in the Rain, they aren’t being hyperbolic, or blinded by Baby-Boom nostalgia. The movie is a rapturous experience — pure , entrancing joy from the opening guitar chord to the final end credit. It’s no wonder I smiled so broadly that night.\n\nIt could have been a disaster. When you think of all the terrible so-called “rock movies” that had been made up to that point — and would be made immediately after — essentially updates of the boring all-star musical revues of the late 1920s and early 1940s, you can well imagine A Hard Day’s Night being every bit as anemic and disposable. Fortunately the Beatles wanted nothing to do with that format, and United Artists didn’t care what sort of picture they made so long as whatever it was came in on time, on budget and produced a marketable soundtrack album. † While it’s certainly possible to create good or even great popular art under confining conditions, it’s when what they do isn’t being taken all that seriously and no one above them is paying strict attention that creative people slip their best work into the marketplace. (Think of the men who made the great Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s and ’50s.) Alun Owen, after observing the Beatles’ personalities and the prison-of-success in which they were trapped, wrote a comic, slightly surreal “day-in-the-life” which Richard Lester, himself a bit of a Surrealist, filmed with a friskiness and a willingness to try anything — to be open to the possibilities of the moment — that were (and are) very rare in controlled studio moviemaking and probably only achievable then in an independent production. Borrowing some of the effects embraced by La Nouvelle Vague (jump-cuts, hand-held Arriflex cameras and documentary realism)‡ Lester and his team fashioned a kind of cinematic jeu d’esprit that nips playfully at conventions but seldom draws serious blood.\n\nNo one of course was sure how the Beatles, whatever their extemporaneous wit with the press and the public, would perform scripted dialogue and movement on film, but they proved remarkable adepts. They were naturals in front of the camera, making it all look both easier than it was and as if they were making up the lines as they went along. In this, as in a number of things, they resemble another quartet of performers: They’re the Marx Bros. for the rock ‘n’ roll generation, antic and cheerfully disdainful of everything the straight world demands of them. That’s one of the reasons, I imagine, that viewers often think the four are ad-libbing, although the people who made the movie aver that Owen wrote most of their characteristically accurate one-liners. (Lester maintains that the structure of the script was his, the dialogue entirely Owen’s.) And while none of the Beatles is remotely like the Marxes, it’s easy to see John Lennon as a Groucho figure, the natural leader and chief cut-up. His scene backstage with Anna Quayle in which they trade elliptical exchanges rivals some of Groucho’s great duologues with Margaret Dumont, and Lennon has an enormously appealing screen persona throughout. Paul didn’t get a specialty sequence as John, George and Ringo did, presumably because he was yoked to Wilfrid Brambell, playing his rambunctious Irish grandfather and Ringo’s largely silent “runaway” scenes may seem like attempts to make him over into Harpo Marx, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton rolled into one§ (the bit with the camera and the one involving a long coat and mud puddles are especially Keatonian) but the drummer has his own idiosyncratic charm that doesn’t rely on our memories of anybody else. George meanwhile got one of the movie’s best dialogue scenes as the honest innocent in a land of hard-edged hucksters, sweetly popping every pretentious balloon in the tastemaker’s display.\n\nAside from the Beatles, the engaging cast includes Norman Rossington as their dyspeptic manager, whom no one would confuse with Brian Epstein; the amiable John Junkin as his somewhat off-balance assistant, who moves his lips while reading Son of MAD; young David Janson (billed as “Jaxon”), who looks a bit like a miniature version of Robert Stephens, as the hooky-playing boy Ringo briefly encounters¶; John Vernon, peerlessly stuffy as a train passenger who thinks riding the rails twice a week confers some sort of exalted set of rights on him; the writer Jeremy Lloyd as a nightclub patron whose grinning leaps into the air Ringo copies; Victor Spinetti, hilariously splenetic as the harassed, Angora wearing television director; and Kenneth Haigh, who snobbishly refused a credit for his wonderful performance as the marketing genius George deflates and whose inane jabber (“She’s a trend-setter. It’s her profession.”) is creepily relevant to our own period, in which clueless untested teenagers list theirs as “social media influencer.” Brambell as Grandfather McCarthy is the movie’s sly secret weapon, continually complicating everyone’s lives, encouraging arguments, getting what he can from his reflected glory and generally putting (to paraphrase one of John’s puns) a Spaniard into the works. When he accidentally rises up in an elevator under the stage to interrupt two Wagnerian singers in rehearsal it’s funny enough; when he pops up a second time during the Beatles’ concert it’s unexpected, and riotous. At the time of filming, Brambell was the star of the popular comedy series Steptoe and Son (Americanized later as Sanford and Son) where he was often referred to as a dirty old man, hence the recurring deadpan joke here about his being a clean old man. And although he was scarcely old enough to be Paul’s grandfather, Brambell is the antic antidote to youth-worship, particularly welcome against the scenes of Beatlemania the movie captures and which gave so many parents the whim-whams in 1964.\n\nIt’s the depiction of that adolescent phenomenon which so memorably starts the picture, and which came to define the contours of the Beatles’ off-stage existence — in Grandfather McCartney’s apt phrase, “A train and a room, and a car and a room, and a room and a room.” The screenwriter saw something rather desperate in that, and while he did his best to make it more comic than tragic, even in 1964 one can see how their fans’ brainless (and, presumably, erotic) idolatry was eventually going to wear on the four to such an extent they stopped performing in public; of their shambolic Shea Stadium appearance in 1965 they later complained, quite understandably, that they couldn’t hear themselves or each other over the screaming. While kids of the Beatles’ own age also went gaga over Elvis Presley a few years earlier the only previous sustained edition of this teenage mass hysteria I know of is the comparable emergence of Frank Sinatra at the Paramount Theatre 20 years before… although what Heinrich Heine famously called Lisztomania predated that by a century. Some have suggested the war and the disappearance of so many eligible young men from the home front had something to do with it, but as Sinatra’s fans were teenagers, that explanation doesn’t hold much water. It may be true that adolescent anxiety about the war contributed, just as it’s remotely possible that “Beatlemania” may have been triggered by the murder of Jack Kennedy. Still, and even if we grant that some of those bobbysoxers may have been paid by Sinatra’s promoters to scream their heads off, the whole business baffles me, as does the concomitant behavior of the kids in 1964. Erotic compulsion? The simple inherent madness of adolescence? Sex does seem to be the likeliest explanation. But some of the girls in the audience of the movie’s climactic live television concert appear on the verge of complete mental, physical and psychological collapse, not merely screeching but tearfully wailing — sobbing as if their hearts are breaking. Jesus, what were they weeping about?\n\nReaders of these pages will know that while I honor certain favorite filmmakers (usually, with the notable exception of Sidney Lumet, writer/directors) I do not subscribe generally to the whorishly applied Auteur Theory. Still, in an exercise like this one, shot on the cheap in black-and-white (an asset, although it may not have seemed so at the time) and on a foreshortened schedule, a director whose attributes include both nerves and adaptability is probably essential. Lester, who had worked with the Goons on television and directed their crazy-quilt short The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film (both projects anticipating the visual approach taken by Monty Python) was ideal in this respect, although his sense of style never obtrudes on A Hard Day’s Night as it did a couple of years later on A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Gilbert Taylor’s superb cinematography, often achieved via hand-held camera, is unerring and includes a beautiful panning shot of Paul singing “And I Love Her” with lens flare from an arc light creating a striking halo effect around him. (Naturally the brass at United Artists thought it was a mistake.) And John Jympson’s masterly editing makes each moment feel simultaneously surprising and inevitable; you can’t second-guess any of his choices.\n\nHowever well A Hard Day’s Night works as a comedy, or even as a kind of fictional semi-documentary, the filmmakers never forget that it was as a band that the Beatles were famous, and the musical respites are among the most radiantly happy ever committed to film. That opening twang on the title song, married to the image of John, George and Ringo running toward the camera pursued by dozens of young people, never fails to make me smile, and it’s so perfectly of a piece you can’t quite believe it wasn’t all planned that way. (It wasn’t; the song was an after-thought.) The train sequence at the start contains some surreal moments, as when the boys are seen outside the compartment window, running beside the locomotive and begging John Vernon for their ball back, and this is extended in the next scene, when they begin playing cards in the baggage compartment and, after “I Should Have Known Better” begins, are suddenly seen with their instruments, singing and playing. You don’t question it, you just accept the parameters of it as the movie Beatles’ reality the same way you accept the topsy-turvy world of the Marx Bros. A number can begin mischievously, as when John attempts to cheer Ringo out of his funk by singing “If I Fell” directly to him or on the soundtrack only, divorced from the boys’ actions, like the exuberant “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, which feels in retrospect the apotheosis of the Beatles as, in Ringo’s description, “just four guys who loved each other.”#\n\nSpeaking of Ringo, this seems to be as good a place as any to shamefacedly acknowledge how criminally I underrated his musicianship several years ago when I used routinely to refer to the drummer as “the luckiest son of a bitch who ever lived.” Beyond that being a cheap, sneering crack, it wasn’t at all accurate. True, Starr was not the songwriter or the singer John and Paul were but, at least in the beginning of their recording career, his accompaniments were technically miles beyond the merely adequate guitar playing of the other three, and he continued to provide expert and even inspired rhythm until the band broke up in 1970. He was also likable in the extreme, and, like John, a genuine screen presence in a way Paul and George could never hope to be.\n\nIn any case, as the writer Mark Lewisohn has noted, with Pete Best at the drums the Beatles would have likely remained merely a popular Liverpool band. With Ringo, they became themselves.\n\n*Weirdly, I do have distinct memories from that time of hearing the Beatles on the radio and, missing the wit of the third-person writing, thinking the song was called “She Loves Me,” not “She Loves You.”\n\n†The movie actually went into profit before it was even released due to advance orders on the soundtrack LP which was UA’s primary concern.\n\n‡Lester himself used a hand-held the camera to shoot the train sequences — the dialogue of which because the camera lacked a sound recorder had to be looped in post-production.\n\n§The silent comedy links in A Hard Day’s Night are made explicit late in the picture, when the boys are chased by the London police; for an American audience (and Lester is an American by birth and upbringing) the sight of a small army of bumbling constables in their helmets running through the urban streets inevitably merges with our images of Mack Sennett’s Keystone Kops. As for my Marx Bros. analogy, Groucho was adamant after seeing the picture that the Beatles in no way resembled himself and his brothers, claiming, absurdly, that they were “real people” — when did you last encounter anyone remotely like Chico or Harpo? His contention that the Beatles, as they come across in A Hard Day’s Night, have little to differentiate one from another, however, has some merit… just not much.\n\n¶Janson/Jaxon is quite good, but clearly too old for the role as written; his character admits to being just under 11 but the young actor is pretty obviously closer to 14.\n\n#Although John, who had a book-related event while the sequence was being shot, disappears at odd moments, reappears and then vanishes again."
