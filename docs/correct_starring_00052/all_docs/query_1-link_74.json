        "text": "Here’s a later tape, one which has obviously been overrecorded with much later programmes, as the first few are from 1990, with the first one being Film 90 in which Barry Norman reviews:\n\nGoodfellas\n\nA Shock to the System\n\nKorczak\n\nBetsy’s Wedding\n\nThere’s a report on the making of My Blue Heaven. It’s amusing that this comes immediately after the review of Goodfellas, and Barry says that Steve Martin’s character is nothing like Ray Liotta’s – in fact, both films were based on the same man, mobster Henry Hill. While Nick Pileggi was writing the book Wiseguy, and the screenplay for Goodfellas, he was married to Nora Ephron, who saw all the interview material he was collecting about Hill, and realised that the story of this mobster going into witness protection was a suitable subject for comedy.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 23rd October 1990 – 22:20\n\nAfter this, recording switches to BBC 2 for part of The Late Show with a round table discussing Twin Peaks featuring top TV producer Verity Lambert.\n\nFilm critic Suzanne Moore.\n\nAnd speaker of words he doesn’t understand, Paul Morley. No, really, he’s quoted as calling Twin Peaks Freudian, but admits he doesn’t really know what Freudian means, and as a defence says he used it because David Lynch doesn’t know what he’s doing either.\n\nThere’s also a rather lame ‘bit’ after the discussion with an actor who might look like Kyle MacLachlan if the lights went out, doing a lame monologue that doesn’t seem to go anywhere.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd October 1990 – 23:15\n\nAfter this, recording switches to a short segment of Tomorrow’s World looking at Virtual Reality. Always a treat to discover a TW clip. Feast your eyes on the state of the art of VR in 1990.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 1st November 1990 – 20:00\n\nThen, recording switches again to ITV this time for The Return Of Mr Bean. He doesn’t rank at the top of the comedy I enjoy, but I have to admit, it’s often very funny.\n\nThis situation is even funnier after you’ve seen the rather ludicrous events that brought him here.\n\nThere’s John Junkin as a Maitre D’.\n\nRoger Lloyd Pack as a waiter.\n\nIn the next sketch, co-writer Robin Driscoll makes an appearance. This sketch has one of the best punchlines ever.\n\nAfter this, recording switches to a bit of Wogan and they’re talking about Twin Peaks again, with Terry going live to Snoqualmie, Washington, where the show is shot. I was clearly not that interested in this, because this recording stops before the segment does.\n\nUnderneath, another demonstration that younger me was an idiot, because the older recording on this tape contained the Academy Awards 1985. On the part we have here, we can see the award for Visual Effects, presented by William Hurt and Candice Bergen.\n\nIt’s won by Dennis Muren, Mike McAlister, George Gibbs and Lorne Peterson for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\n\nAnne Reinking and Jeff Bridges present the Best Score award.\n\nIt’s won by Maurice Jarre for A Passage to India who thanks Mozart for not being eligible.\n\nJennifer Beals and Glenn Close present the Best Costume award.\n\nIt’s won for Amadeus by Theodor Pistek.\n\nShirley Maclaine presents the Best Actor award.\n\nIt’s won by F Murray Abraham – a reliable answer in Pointless if the category is Best Actor winners.\n\nCary Grant presents a special award.\n\nIt’s presented to James Stewart.\n\nNext Jack Lemmon introduces Diana Ross singing ‘I Just Called to Say I Love You’. Although I cut it out while recording, because I always hated the song performances, and resented them taking up time in the edited highlights.\n\nWilliam Hurt is back with Genevieve Bujold to present the Best Editing award.\n\nIt’s won by Jim Clark for The Killing Fields.\n\nPlacido Domingo and Faye Dunaway present the Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIt’s won for Dangerous Moves by Richard Dembo (I presume).\n\nNext, Steven Spielberg, presenting the Best Director award, pays tribute to the late Francois Truffaut. If I were Spielberg I’d tell them to stuff their presenting gig until they gave him the actual award.\n\nTo make matters worse, the winner is Milos Forman, who also won the same award in 1976, the year that Jaws was nominated for Best Picture, but Spielberg wasn’t nominated at all. Jaws. JAWS! One of the greatest films of all time, a film that only exists because Spielberg is a genius director. And they’d do the same thing to him a year or so later, with The Color Purple. Really, the Academy is trash. Well done, Milos. I hope you enjoy your award. So, Milos, take your award and get off my property.\n\nRobert Duvall presents the Best Actress award.\n\nIt’s won by Sally Field, giving her infamous “You really like me” speech. Which I never thought was too bad. Maybe a little practiced, but it’s literally her job so that’s not much of a gripe.\n\nJack Lemmon is back to announce the nominations for Best Film. But to present the award, it’s Laurence Olivier. There was a little panic during the ceremony, because instead of reading the nominations again (which would, admittedly, have been pointless after the long montage from the films) he simply read out the winner, but the nominations were in alphabetical order, so there was a worry that he’d simply read out the first name.\n\nSaul Zaentz, the producer, accepts the award.\n\nThere’s a round-up of all the awards that were cut from the edited highlights. It includes Prince winning for Best Original Song Score, which might be the only time this has ever been given – it’s not listed on the main Wikipedia page as even a discontinued category. I asked on Twitter and friend of the blog Lee Wall pointed to the previous two years that also awarded this award, but it was shelved until there were more original; musicals.\n\nAfter this, Barry Norman talks to some of the winners and losers as they visit one of the parties. The recording stops just before he talks to David Puttnam the morning after. I’m not sure why this recording is cut off. Timer recording? Oh well."
