        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n16 Jul 2024, 09:04\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nTom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise has added a new face to its incredible roster.\n\nThe eighth Mission: Impossible film has enlisted John Wick 3 and Star Wars stunt performer Stephen Oyoung. He’s also acted in the likes of NCIS, Scandal and Star Wars’ series The Book of Boba Fett.\n\nAccording to Deadline, it’s not yet known which role Stephen will play or how his story will unfold just yet, but given his impeccable stunt career, we’re expecting the big screen star to get up to plenty of high-octane action.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nJeremy Clarkson's 'relatable' Euros final reaction divides fans\n\nStrictly Come Dancing pro Graziano Di Prima confirms he's been axed from upcoming series - read his full statement here\n\nFans delighted as This Morning reveal summer hosts covering Ben Shephard and Cat Deeley's seven week break\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThe Twisters actor took to his Instagram page to share his excitement, telling fans: “Mission accepted! Thank you to Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie for having me along for the ride. An absolute dream come true and an incredible master class in filmmaking everyday! Can’t wait for you all to see it!”\n\nStephen’s casting news came as new co-star Simon Pegg bid his time on Mission: Impossible 8 goodbye.\n\nThe Spaced actor has starred as Benji Dunn since 2006’s Mission: Impossible III and took to Instagram Stories earlier this month to give an update to fans, and teased the lofty heights the next M:I film is set to reach.\n\nIn a video taken seemingly from his trailer on set, Simon revealed: \"I’ve just wrapped my last day on Mission: Impossible, and said a farewell to everybody.”\n\nDiscussing the massive delays in M:I 8's filming, the Hot Fuzz actor continued: “We started shooting the first part of this story in September 2020 and here we are in July 2024. What a journey it’s been, and what a f****** incredible spectacle this next film is going to be.\n\n“I’m so excited for you to see it. Till then, Benji Dunn, signing off,” he concluded.\n\nIt’s been a long road to get the last couple of Mission: Impossible movies off the ground, with Dead Reckoning: Part One (as it was previously known) famously filming throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and only being released in June 2023.\n\nThe Hollywood strikes continued to play havoc on Cruise’s scheduling, and also caused a shift in marketing too, with Dead Reckoning: Part One dropping the ‘Part One’ after landing on streaming services.\n\nIt is not believed that the name change reflects any changes to plans and the eighth film will still be a direct sequel to the seventh Mission: Impossible film’s story.\n\nAs well as Pegg and Cruise back for another adrenaline-pumping adventure, the likes of Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Mariela Garriga and Mark Gatiss are also expected to return after their parts in Dead Reckoning.\n\nJoining the cast for the next film are Hannah Waddingham, Lucy Tulugarjuk, Janet McTeer, Katy O’Brian and Tramell Tillman.\n\nWhile Jeremy Renner recently spoke up about being open to return to his role in the franchise, it’s not believed that the William Brandt actor will be making an appearance in Mission: Impossible 8."
