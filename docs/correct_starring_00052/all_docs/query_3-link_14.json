        "text": "John Corbett is looking back at his career and Hollywood and says he regrets becoming an actor as “it’s been unfulfilling.”\n\nThe actor known for playing the character of Aidan Shaw on Sex and the City and reprising the role in the sequel series And Just Like That… shared his thoughts about his career.\n\n“Look, I’m in the fourth quarter of the football game now, in life and in showbiz. It’s just a fact,” Corbett said in an appearance on the Fly on the Wall podcast. “So I can reveal now I picked the f***ing wrong thing to do with my life.”\n\nCorbett also starred in United Stars of Tara, Parenthood, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, Undone, Rebel, and How I Met Your Father. The actor has also had film roles in movies like To All the Boys and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\n\n“Have you ever sat in a f***ing waiting room of a doctor’s office for like an hour and been like, ‘what the f**?'” Corbett said. “For me, that’s what making a movie is like, because I’m not part of any creative process.”\n\nThe actor said that his creativity in the field has not been fulfilling adding, “I’ve made a lot of money, I live in a beautiful home, people come to me at every restaurant I go in, I’m a friend of the world. But as far as a fulfilling creative work life, I didn’t write one f—ing line. I didn’t write one joke that made people laugh. So it’s been unfulfilling on that level.”"
