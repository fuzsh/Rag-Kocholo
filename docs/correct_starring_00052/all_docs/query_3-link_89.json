        "text": "Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider is dealing with a pretty devastating loss. Schneider’s wife Alicia passed away in 2023 and he has been reeling from the loss ever since. Now, he revealed that someone got into his home and stole the urn with her ashes and his wedding rings just weeks after someone stole the General Lee car that Alicia gave him.\n\nHe wrote in an emotional statement on his Facebook page, “I am truly sorry because I never thought I would be forced to stoop this low. But this is one of the things that was stolen from me out of my house. Alicia’s ashes. Attached to it was a tiny urn with ashes… A silver cross with “Smile” and “Alicia” on it… And my wedding ring for crying out loud. I wonder if they’re going to give away my wedding ring and cross anytime soon? Truly disgusted.”\n\nHe continued, “So as you can imagine, this is a very emotional time for me. It appears as if Alicia’s ashes and my belongings were taken earlier this year. No one ever told me where they went. While I hold no grudge against who currently has them I do believe I should have been involved or at least asked About where they should wind up. They were taken from my house and put into someone else’s house without my permission or even so much as a conversation about these very personal items.”\n\nSchneider added that he saw a photo of the urn somewhere on the Internet and wants to get the person who stole it punished. Not only that but he is trying to stop a sale of his Dukes of Hazzard memorabilia being sold at an auction against his wishes. He asked his fans to help stop a sale of his memorabilia being stored at a Louisana studio, held by M&E Partners and Integra Asset Solutions. Reportedly, they were selling movie props, costumes, scripts, autographs, vintage cars, guitars and many more items.\n\nAt the time of posting, the sale has been taken down and Schneider said that he is still making sure that it won’t happen again. The contents of the sale are likely from the property that Schneider lost in 2019 due to a foreclosure."
