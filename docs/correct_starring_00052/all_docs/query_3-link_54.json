        "text": "Blumhouse has released the trailer for its new upcoming horror thriller Afraid, which stars John Cho, who plays Curtis who finds himself facing off with a revolutionary new AI home device that goes rogue.\n\nIn the film, Curtis and his family “are selected to test a revolutionary new home device: a digital family assistant called AIA. Taking smart home to the next level, once the unit and all its sensors and cameras are installed in their home, AIA seems able to do it all.\n\n“She learns the family’s behaviors and begins to anticipate their needs. And she can make sure nothing – and no one – gets in her family’s way.”\n\nThis looks like a good film with an interesting twist. While evil AI is the crux of the story, there’s something more going one, something a little more sinister.\n\nThe movie also stars Katherine Waterston, Havana Rose Liu, Lukita Maxwell, Ashley Romans, Greg Hill, Riki Lindhome, Wyatt Lindner, Isaac Bae, Todd Waring, and David Dastmalchian, with Keith Carradine, check out the new trailer.\n\nAfraid was written and directed by Chris Weitz (About a Boy and The Twilight Saga: New Moon), and it’s produced by Blumhouse’s Jason Blum and Andrew Miano.\n\nAfraid is set to open in theaters on August 30th."
