        "text": "The LA Phil is taking audiences to the movies this month with a trio of shows that will feature popular film scores performed live by the orchestra.\n\n“It’s more akin to a classical music rock concert,” said Maestro David Newman, who will lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the concert dubbed “Maestro of the Movies: The Music of John Williams and More.”\n\nThe shows will take place at the Hollywood Bowl July 12,13 and 14. Williams was scheduled to share the stage with Newman during the concert, but according to LA Phil officials, due to a recent health concern he will be unable to perform.\n\nWilliams has scored more than 100 movies and created some of the most iconic film scores of all time for films like “Superman,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,” as well as films in the “Star Wars” franchise.\n\n“Everyone has movies that they love, and a lot of them are John Williams movies, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas movies,” Newman said. “And the music in them is a big integral part of it and John Williams is a huge part of these films,” he said.\n\nAnd Star Wars fans tend to bring the force with them to these concert since many bring lightsabers to the show and wave them around during the “Star Wars,” portion of the show.\n\n“It’s a very visceral kind of nostalgic experience,” Newman said.\n\nBesides Williams’ music, the night will also include scores from movies made during Hollywood’s “Golden Age,” Newman said.\n\n“It’s all an ecstatic celebration of the music of the music of John Williams and also of the entire output of Hollywood,” he said.\n\n‘Maestro of the Movies: The Music of John Williams and More’\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. July 12-13, 7:30 p.m. July 14\n\nWhere: Hollywood Bowl, 2301 Highland Ave, Los Angeles\n\nTickets: $54-241\n\nInformation: hollywoodbowl.com"
