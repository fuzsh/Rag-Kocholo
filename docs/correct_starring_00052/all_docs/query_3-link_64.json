Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore \"The Office,\" Krasinski studied acting and took on small jobs in show business.\n\nKrasinski studied theatre arts at Brown University and the National Theater Institute, as well as at the Royal Shakespeare Company in England and the Actors Center in New York City, according to The New York Times.\n\nAfter school, he went to New York City, where he played in some minor roles, like commercials, movies, and off-Broadway plays.\n\nHe also interned as a scriptwriter on the show \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2004, he got his big break when he was cast as Jim Halpert on \"The Office.\"\n\nPlaying Jim on \"The Office\" was Krasinski's first major role, and he did it from 2005 until 2013.\n\nKrasinski's role as Halpert was beloved by fans and critics alike. In 2006 and 2007, the cast won Screen Actors Guild Awards for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series.\n\nDuring his time on the show, Krasinski did more than just act.\n\nHe once shared that he had shot the Scranton footage you see during the show's opening credits when he was researching the area before they started filming.\n\nHe also directed several episodes of the show, including \"The Boat,\" \"Lotto,\" and \"Sabre.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrasinski began showing up in smaller roles in various movies.\n\nAround the time he was cast as Halpert, Krasinski had minor roles in \"Law and Order: Criminal Intent,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" and \"American Dad!\"\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, he appeared in films like \"Jarhead\" and \"A New Wave.\" He had small roles in movies such as \"For Your Consideration\" and \"The Holiday.\"\n\nIn 2007, he starred in the romantic comedy \"License to Wed\" with Mandy Moore and Robin Williams. In 2008, he had a role in \"Leatherheads,\" directed by George Clooney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe made his directorial debut in 2009.\n\nBack in 2009, a writer's strike halted production of \"The Office.\" Instead of taking a vacation, Krasinski got to work to resume post-production work on his directorial debut, an adaptation of David Foster Wallace's \"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men.\"\n\nIt was a film he had been trying to make for more than five years.\n\nAt the time, Krasinski told The New York Times, \"It was just something that I wanted to do, and it seemed like the only way to get it done was to do it myself.\"\n\nThe film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and got OK reviews, with most critics agreeing that while it didn't quite make the mark, it was obvious that Krasinski deserved an A for effort.\n\nA review on NPR stated, \"As much potential as Krasinski shows in these brief flashes, the balance of the film is as dull and colorless as the gray-brick backdrop in Sara's interview room. His reverence for the source material is obvious and admirable, but it also prevents him from developing his own original ideas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe began getting roles in bigger movies with impressive casts.\n\nThe same year of his directorial debut, Krasinski starred in \"Away We Go\" with Maya Rudolph.\n\nHe had a role in \"It's Complicated\" alongside Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin, a part that scored him a National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Awards for best ensemble cast.\n\nIn 2011, he also starred in \"Something Borrowed\" and \"The Muppets.\" By this time, he had pretty much solidified his role as a movie actor instead of a sitcom actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, Krasinski worked with Matt Damon to release the film \"Promised Land.\"\n\nKrasinski starred in, coproduced, and cowrote the screenplay for the drama with Damon.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Krasinski came up with the idea for the script and then developed it with author Dave Eggers.\n\nHe then pitched the idea to Damon for the two of them to write and star in it, and Damon agreed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter \"The Office\" ended, Krasinski founded the production company Sunday Night Productions, which eventually led to \"Lip Sync Battle.\"\n\nKrasinski started the company with Allyson Seeger, and over the next few years, produced a few small shows that never really panned out.\n\nBut in 2015, his idea for \"Lip Sync Battle\" became a reality and then a hit television show.\n\nThe idea came when Krasinski, his wife Emily Blunt, and Stephen Merchant were brainstorming ideas for Krasinski's appearance on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\" Jimmy Fallon ended up developing it into a recurring segment on his show.\n\nThat segment eventually became a full-fledged TV series Spike hosted by LL Cool J with commentator Chrissy Teigen and became wildly popular pretty much immediately.\n\nThe premiere was the highest-rated non-scripted premiere in Spike's history. In 2016, the show received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the outstanding structured reality program category.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016 was a huge year for him, as Krasinski attached his name to several impressive projects.\n\nFirst, there was the fact that he was an executive producer on the drama \"Manchester by the sea,\" a film that went on to receive six nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\nAlthough Krasinski didn't write or direct the film, he has stated that it was his \"original idea.\"\n\nThen Krasinski starred in Michael Bay's film \"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.\"\n\nOn top of that, he directed and starred in the comedy-drama film \"The Hollars,\" which was the first feature film produced under his Sunday Night company.\n\nThe indie film premiered at Sundance Film Festival, and reviews were good — Rolling Stone said he tackled \"the most cliched genre in the movie business — the dysfunctional family dramedy\" and \"pull[ed] it off with uncommon humor and compassion.\"\n\nHe even went back to the television world when he announced he would be starring in the Amazon series \"Jack Ryan.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a little bit of a break from Hollywood, Krasinski returned in 2018 with his biggest move yet: \"A Quiet Place.\"\n\nKrasinski directed and co-wrote the horror film, and co-starred in it with Blunt.\n\nIt was released on April 6, 2018, and immediately became a movie everyone was talking about and it was lauded by critics and viewers.\n\nA review in Variety summed it up pretty well, stating, \"Krasinski, whose personality in the features he has directed ('The Hollars,' 'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men') has always been a bit fuzzy, now brings himself into focus with the genre brinksmanship of 'A Quiet Place.'\"\n\nThe film cemented Krasinski's place as a Hollywood A-lister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, Krasinski landed a spot on Time’s Most Influential People list.\n\nIn July 2018, Deadline reported that Damon is in the early stages of starring in \"The King of Oil,\" a film that would be under Krasinski's Sunday Night Productions. Sources say that Krasinski might direct the film, but that hasn't been confirmed.\n\nTime also named him one of the Most Influential People of the Year for 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
