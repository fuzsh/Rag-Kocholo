This gripping sea yarn is at once a riveting adventure story and a testament to human tenacity. In a salty, slashing style, he unfolds his extraordinary saga, revealing both a rich sense of history and an insuppressible Welsh wit.\n\n— Caribbean Compass\n\n\"There's no better [Jones] book to start with than this one...It's a fantastic read. Don't miss it.\"\n\n— The Ensign"
