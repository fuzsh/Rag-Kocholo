        "text": "Charlaine Harris was getting a fair amount of notice in, of all places, rec.arts.sf.written. The wife and Jan both look forward to these. I'm getting them to Katie Dean, who should have a full report on them shortly. If you needed another indicator that the American South had a pretty decent stranglehold on horror, try this.\n\nIan R. MacLeod first came into my purview when I auto-bought his Arkham House release, 'Voyages by Starlight'. I was actually fairly annoyed that the mostly mainstream stories I read had been published in science fiction magazines. This looks like a particularly interesting novel, however. The premise has it set in an 19th century where the \"industrial revolution\" is powered not by the science we know, but by magic, which must be mined in fairly hazardous conditions. A lower class miner boy finds himself drawn an upper class girl desintined for the magic biz. It looks meaty and entertaining.\n\nI met John G. Hemry at Worldcon last year, and thought that he had a lot of interesting things to say. He seemed to be focusing on the legal aspects of military SF. It's an odd but potentially appealing niche, because it offers the opportunity fior diligent legal research in our era and thoughtful what-ifs for a potential era of space travel. If we don't blow it up before we manage to blast off, there's no doubt that lawyers in space, however frightening that sounds will be a fairly common occurence.\n\nThis is a very odd idea that looks pretty interesting. Husband and wife Robin McKinley and Peter Dickinson collaborated on six longish stories (ranging to novella-length) all based around imaginary water creatures. I can actually understand why this hasn't been done before, but the result has a lot of appeal to readers of horror and fantasy. As one of the stories is about a Kraken, it's bound to get read, as I;'m a real sucker for a Kraken story."
