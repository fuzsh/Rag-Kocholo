        "text": "My Review & Overall Thoughts\n\nTLDR: Closes out the Angels of Elysium trilogy on an oh-so-satisfying note.\n\nWarning: Potential spoilers ahead\n\nWildenstein has saved the best for last with Starlight. Bringing the series full circle, Starlight sees the reunion of Leigh and Jarod via their reincarnated souls, Naya and Adam. Ever since the revelation in the epilogue of Feather that their souls were saved, there has been a buildup to when the two star-crossed lovers would meet again, and their inevitable coming together does not disappoint.\n\nThe two begin as reluctant allies with an undeniable chemistry. Banter, playful teasing, sexual tension – you name it, they have it. They initially resist their attraction, which tantalizingly heightens the question of will they or won’t they. Even when they do get together, enough hurdles are thrown their way that the true outcome of their relationship is not known until relatively late in the book. Consequently, the book retains your interest throughout its entirety. It is a well-written romance (the best in the series, in my opinion), and you spice lovers out there will be pleased to hear that it features several steamy scenes.\n\nWhile Naya and Adam’s romance might be the primary focus of Starlight, it is not the be-all and end-all of the book. The story features a compelling subplot pertaining to a clandestine group of fletching guardian angels. Adam is a founding member of the group, and Naya wants to be allowed into its fold. Wary of the unwanted attention that could result from having the child of a seraphim in his group, Adam prohibits her involvement, but Naya’s stubbornness and determination eventually prevail. Before long, they find themselves working together to infiltrate and bring down the notorious Circle Foundation, and this mission of theirs infuses the story with action, suspense, danger, and plenty of oh-no moments. You will be turning page after page to see how everything unfolds.\n\nFurther spurring your page turning is the return of several notable characters from the previous books in the series, including Mimi, Celeste, and Asher. We are able to see how Asher and Celeste are faring over a decade into their relationship (spoiler alert: they are as adorable as ever), and we are able to witness the long-awaited reunion of Mimi and her son in all but name. In addition to being enjoyable, the inclusion of these familiar faces imbues the story with a sense of continuity with the preceding two books.\n\nWith regard to the writing, it is the strongest of the trilogy. Wildenstein’s writing is engaging and easy to understand. Her use of dual points of view (Adam and Naya) not only allows us to gain an equally in-depth understanding of both protagonists but also enhances the suspense and consequently, enjoyability of the book. Further contributing to the book’s readability is its narrative voice. The book is written in the first person, which lends the story an immersive quality – you experience everything through the eyes of Naya and Adam.\n\nLastly, I have to take a moment to express how much I enjoyed the ending. So as to not give too much away, I will simply say that it beautifully ties up the Angels of Elysium trilogy, granting happy endings to those deserving of one.\n\nThe not so good\n\nOne of the major revelations toward the end of the book was not much of a surprise; I saw it coming from a country mile. In addition, two of the characters, Calliope and Grayson, have rather slapdash storylines. Grayson feels particularly ill-used, having been introduced to create a contrived love triangle between Naya, Adam, and him.\n\nOverall\n\nStarlight is an entertaining, bingeable book that closes out the Angels of Elysium trilogy on a wholly satisfying note. I am intrigued to read more books by Wildenstein, particularly her latest series, The Kingdom of Crows.\n\nHave you read Starlight? If so, let me know what you thought of it in the comments section below!\n\n-Julia"
