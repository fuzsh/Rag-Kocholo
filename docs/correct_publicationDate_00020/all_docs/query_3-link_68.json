        "text": "I knew my non-fiction reading streak couldn’t continue for long…\n\nHonestly, this book came roaring out of the gates and ticked all my boxes straight off. Robert Dinsdale, I salute you, sir: you are a bloody genius.\n\nParis by Starlight is a smorgasbord of delights- so much so that it’s hard to know what to rhapsodise about first. Is it the dreamy, fairytale-like nature of Dinsdale’s prose? Is it the magic itself- the most original take on it that I’ve read in ages? Or is it the way he combines wonder and beauty with the uglier side of human nature: war, human nature, the refugee crisis?\n\nThis review is in danger of waxing lyrical, so let me try and get my head in order so I can wax lyrical in a logical way.\n\nSo. This book is about magic, but more importantly it’s about the power that humans have to dream better futures into existence. It’s set present day Paris, where a harpist named Isabelle helps a runaway girl and so stumbles into the lives of a family of refugees. They’re the People: a nation somewhere vaguely near Russia, now scattered to the four corners of Europe and the magic that lived there gone.\n\nWhen Isabelle meets Levon, Arina and the other members of their refugee group, though, things start to change. Magic starts blossoming where the People make their new home, in Paris, and it’s fantastic: glowing flowers, shoals of luminous fish, flora and fauna that sprouts out of nowhere and colonise the Jardins des Tuileries. Other refugees start arriving to build a new future in the city. And slowly, resistance to their presence starts to build among the people who already live there.\n\nWhat I liked so much about this book is that it’s not all misty-eyed and wonderful- though don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of wonder here. If you liked The Toymakers, this is for you. But Dinsdale sours this fairytale in the second act with cold, hard reality: people (and Europe) don’t always welcome refugees, even when they bring joy to the world. And cruelty, eventually, will be met with cruelty.\n\nThere are some minor quibbles about Paris by Starlight. Some of the emotional notes fall flat, and I could have done with a bit more development in the inevitable romance between Isabelle and reluctant leader Levon. But on the whole, I can’t complain. With his latest book, Dinsdale serves up a confection of pure delight: it’s a wondrous thing to be able to visit Paris by Starlight and I’d recommend a trip to you all!"
