        "text": "Book 3.1 in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series\n\nPublished in 2018\n\n228 pages\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nGoodreads Sypnosis:\n\nThe Winter Solstice. In a week. I was still new enough to being High Lady that I had no idea what my formal role was to be. If weâ€™d have a High Priestess do some odious ceremony, as lanthe had done the year before. A year. Gods, nearly a year since Rhys had called in his bargain, desperate to get me away from the poison of the Spring Court to save me from my despair. Had he been only a minute later, the Mother knew what would have happened. Where Iâ€™d now be. Snow swirled and eddied in the garden, catching in the brown fibers of the burlap covering the shrubs My mate who had worked so hard and so selflessly, all without hope that I would ever be with him We had both fought for that love, bled for it. Rhys had died for it.\n\nMy Review:\n\nPlot:\n\nI personally loved how this book was less plot focused, and took us more into the minds of these characters that we know and love so well, I practically shrieked when I learnt that this book actually had multiple points of view, I loved reading not only from Feyreâ€™s perspective but Rhysâ€™s too, and the chapters from Cassian and Morâ€™s perspectives were utterly delightful, I love how I got a whole new insight into his character, and, well, Mor has always been my favourite character aside from Feyre and Rhys, so I loved her page time!\n\nBut yes, I personally felt that this novella was more character orientated than plot, and I loved every minute!\n\nCharacters:\n\nFeyre and Rhys, together and separately, were perfection, as always. I will always have all of the love in my heart for these two, they will never not make me swoon, and I will always fangirl over them; the amount of love they have for one another is perfection, like, Rhys has always treated Feyre as his equal, and Feyre loves Rhys with all her being. I love how it felt like both of them had matured throughout this book, even after A Court of Wings and Ruin, like, they learnt to lean on one another more, Iâ€™m certain! And they both love their Inner Circle so much, the whole lot of them give me life! There were so many moments in this book I felt so proud of Feyre, the both of them, in fact.\n\nMor is amazing! I only wish she had more page time, I love how close she is with Feyre, and how highly she holds Rhys and everyone in her regards; reading things from her point of view made me feel so much for her, after everything she went through in the past and as she faces those who have hurt her the most!\n\nElain and Nesta were where I got a tad frustrated, like, taking into account the end of book 3, I personally thought they would both have different mindsets and attitudes but at the same time, I found myself wanting more of her and Elain in the book, and Iâ€™m definitely excited to see whatâ€™s in store for both characters, Iâ€™m still left wondering certain things about both of them, and I know Iâ€™m going to be thinking about this book for a good while now!\n\nAfter the events of WAR, I had been wondering about Amren for a while and was curious to know how she was faring and adjusting, I feel bad kinda for laughing at her in one particular scene, but I felt like I was laughing along with the rest of The Inner Circle and I must admit I enjoyed learning a bit more about the sass queen!\n\nAz and Cassian are both as precious as ever, I love the banter and love between everyone, and I was just laughing at a specific scene with the three Illyrian babies!\n\nFor me, itâ€™s always been the characters that make these stories so amazing, honestly, and I will always hold these books amongst my most favourite.\n\nWriting:\n\nSarah J Maas is without a doubt, one of my all time favourite authors, she writes so magically and vastly, I feel like I can easily always pick up any of her books and get transported away and be reunited with old friends; I can picture everything that she writes so easily, and as always, nothing felt forced! I felt like, during this book, I was right there next to everyone and going through, and feeling what they were! The writing was utterly glorious and addictive, I couldnâ€™t put it down; and even though there were moments when I was raising my eyebrows, I had a feeling these things were happening for a reason and now Iâ€™m even more impatient for the next Tale from Prythian! This world will be one Iâ€™m always happy to fall back into, and Iâ€™ll never not fall under itâ€™s spell!\n\nThe acknowledgements were gorgeous too, Maas puts so much emotion into her books, and her characters, you can tell how much she loves writing them, and ach I canâ€™t wait for Kingdom of Ash, which Iâ€™m fairly sure will be the death of me ðŸ˜­.\n\nOverall:\n\nWhen I heard this was a bridge novella between the two Thorns and Roses series, I had so many feelings and expectations; sufficed it to say, they were definitley met, and then some; this book had every thing I hoped for in it, and I didnâ€™t think I could be more impatient for the next book, but I am! Thank you, Sarah J Maas, for another magical installment! I hope that we have our questions answered even more, and I canâ€™t wait to see how everything from here on develops!\n\nUntil next time, Happy Reading,\n\nBrooklyn ðŸ“š"
