        "text": "We are storm and starlight\n\nSpecter and siren\n\nAnswer and question\n\nExperience this haunting anthology of poems about longing and heartbreak, grieving and new beginnings.\n\nThis I hold as grace: love is not lost\n\nThere’s solace in our meeting and our parting\n\nI let you go and love you all the more\n\nIf I could give this poetry collection 100 stars, I would still complain that there weren't enough. This is truly the most beautiful poetry collection that I've read in a very long time, and I don't even know how I found it. I was just scrolling on my kindle, looking for something to read, and the title caught my eye. I am so, so glad that I decided to read it this evening. The flow and organization of the poems were artfully selected to take the reader on a journey of emotion. We start with adventurous poems about finding one's self-worth and identity, then sorrow in the challenges of finding love. Then our emotions are lifted again with romance and whistful thoughts only to be bashed with heartbreak. But I think what I loved the most is the tasteful end of mixing sorrow and joy together in a hopeful and beautiful conclusion. The entire collection is just incredibly well organized and I felt the transitions from poem to poem were so smoothly twined that it just flowed so perfectly. And the poems themselves?! My gracious. There wasn't a single one that I didn't want to highlight a line from. The mood and vibes of the poetry are like Autumn and Winter, lyrics and melodies, and Midnights by Taylor Swift. Here are a few of my favorite lines: \"do not say I am a closed book when you only have to read me\" \"choose my winter; I will take your night\" \"love me like the fire beneath this flowering earth like the first flash of lightning on a summer night\" All in all, I adored this poetry collection and I now want to go binge everything by this author that I can get my hands on. No content warning is necessary; romance is sweet and not spicy/explicit in any way. There is no cursing and no gore. Highly recommended to all poetry lovers.\n\nContent Ratings:\n\nOther Trigger Warnings:\n\nN/A\n\nOur Reviews of Other Books by this author:"
