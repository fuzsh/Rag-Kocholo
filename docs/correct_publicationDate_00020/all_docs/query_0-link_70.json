        "text": "(If you would like to read reviews of the previous Best New Horror books, jump over to my Reviews page for links.)\n\nAfter the rather slim volume 6 comes a significantly chunkier entry in Stephen Jones’s Best New Horror series. While previous entries had been a tad uneven in terms of quality, volume 7 is pretty good throughout, with only a handful of stories I’d skip through on a reread. As you will see below, a number of stories suffer from weak or unsatisfying endings, but these are often due to the ending being overshadowed an interesting premise or strong opening. So, predictably, this is another 4/5 from me.\n\nBest New Horror 7 comprises twenty-five stories and a poem which mark the best horror shorts published during 1995, and runs as follows:\n\nTirkiluk – Ian R. MacLeod (3/5 – Science Officer Seymour takes a stint manning an Arctic weather station. As winter takes hold, he finds a scavenger nearby. Her name is Tirkiluk and she is an outcast from a nearby eskimo settlement. When Seymour discovers Tirkiluk is heavily pregnant, he lets her stay with him in the rather cramped confines of his hut. Things go south, however, when Seymour accidentally starts a fire that endangers all their lives. This was okay, but the diary format of the story made me feel little more than a witness to a sequence of events, which robbed the story of emotional impact. Also, unless I missed a paragraph somewhere, no reason was given or intimated for Seymour’s decline. Was it supernatural? Was Seymour merely going a bit doolally? It’s as if the story says, “Ehhhh, who cares? Move along, please.” So I will.)\n\nThe Most Boring Woman In The World – Christopher Fowler (4/5 – The ever-reliable Fowler scores another winner. If you only know Fowler through his Bryant & May books, then stop right now and seek out a collection or two of his short fiction. You won’t be disappointed. Anyway, here a housewife tells us of her crushingly boring existence, and how she’s having to perk things up here and there to keep herself from going mad. She starts out with little acts of rebellion, but then oh my do things escalate! As a side note, it’s an interesting editorial choice of Jones to open Best New Horror 7 with a story that keeps the reader at arm’s length in Tirkiluk, and then juxtapose it with one that directly engages the reader. I’m not saying it works perfectly, it’s just… interesting.)\n\nExtinctions In Paradise – Brian Hodge (4/5 – Hodge follows up his excellent The Alchemy Of The Throat (featured in Best New Horror 6) with a very good story which sees Robert, a former journalist, trying to rebuild his life in Mexico following the horrific loss of his wife and children. Now in his adopted homeland, Robert has a new family of sorts in the numerous street kids who scrape a living in and around the neighbourhood. His kindness stands him in good stead too, because it seems these kids have developed a novel – some would say murderous – way to survive on the streets. Dammit, this story was so close to being another 5/5 for Hodge, but was let down by a final act that felt a little tacked on and created a jarring sense of “Whaaaaaaaa…?!!?”. You’ll have to read it to see what I mean. The fact Hodge specifically mentions in his introduction how he came to write those last few pages suggests he knew this and was trying to justify it in some way.)\n\nFood Man – Lisa Tuttle (4/5 – An anorexic teenager hides food under her bed, much preferring to live with the stench of rotting food in her room than to risk putting on weight. Things take a turn for the bizarre when, late one night, a figure emerges out from under her bed. It’s a man, made of food! So what’s a girl to do? Get jiggy with it, of course! If the premise sounds too far-fetched, don’t worry – you are not alone. But let’s cut the author some slack and pretend the girl’s parents and brother are ardent 120-a-day smokers of Woodbines whose sense of smell died long ago, and that, in psychosis, food can be seen to coalesce into the shape of a man and… er… rise up, so to speak. Even so, I would love to know what was in Tuttle’s head when she wrote this. “Okay, yeah, I’ve got this girl, right, and… er… she… er… well, she gets fucked by a man made of food.” Most bizarre of all is that she makes this ludicrous story work, and manages to steer things toward a spine-tingling climax, if you’ll forgive the expression. Pretty impressive, all said.)\n\nMore Tomorrow – Michael Marshall Smith (5/5 – An IT contractor gets chummy with a young colleague, Jeanette, but finds his chances of romance gutter and die when he meets her boyfriend. Straight away our man knows something is off, and his suspicions are all but confirmed when he finds a recent image of Jeanette posted online, then another, and another. Each image is more revealing and more disturbing than the last, and each image is cheered on by a nameless, faceless audience. MMS absolutely nails it in this British Fantasy Award winner; a story that puts an arm over your shoulder, has a laugh and a joke with you and then stabs you in the gut. This story also perfectly illustrates how we have always had a dark side to the internet, as we have had with any creative technology. Finally, as this story was written shortly before the advent of search engines and web browsers, there’s also a certain nostalgic quality for ageing nerds to enjoy. Ah, the days!)\n\nGoing Under – Ramsey Campbell (2/5 – Steve Blythe is queueing for a rare chance to walk through the Mersey Tunnels, along with half of Merseyside it seems. Blythe is one of those fellas who is welded to his mobile phone, much to the annoyance of everyone around him. (This was 1995, kids. People were weird back then.) He is undergoing an acrimonious divorce and is keen for his new squeeze to post off the latest maintenance payment to his ex in order to avoid a legal bollocking. But Val isn’t picking up his calls. Blythe only ever gets his answerphone. When he is harangued and pressed into entering the tunnel by his fellow walkers, Blythe finds he has a more urgent need to make a phone call. Good grief, even after a second read this was a chore to get through. Nearly everything about this story got up my nose, from the hopelessly over-engineered premise and how teeth-grindingly overwritten it was, through to the largely fake, annoying and unfunny characters. At times I swear I was reading a Fat Slags cartoon. Surprisingly, despite all this, Going Under isn’t a total bust. Campbell succeeds in creating a sweaty sense of claustrophobia once the story gets going, but that’s about all to commend it. This is one of those stories you suspect only got published because of the name behind it, and only made it into this book due to a spot of cronyism.)\n\nSurvivor – Dave Smeds (4/5 – It’s 1967 and Troy Chesley is due to return to Vietnam for another tour of duty. He gets a tattoo to commemorate this and asks the artist to draw him a seriously ripped unicorn. Yes, a unicorn. The artist agrees, but only if Troy has the tattoo over his heart. When Troy returns to the conflict he finds his tattoo is somehow keeping him from harm, but at what cost? This is a really good story that explores a few interesting themes, from living someone else’s life to the effects of time-dilation on Troy and those around him, and just when you start wondering where Smeds is going with all this, he pulls out a superb ending. Recommended.)\n\nThe Stones – Patrick Thompson (4/5 – Neil and Jane are holidaying in Cornwall, attempting to locate sites of ancient standing stones. While Cornwall is very nice and all, it seems Jane isn’t getting much of a mystical tingle from anything they’ve found so far. An old man they meet suggests a nearby beach, but there doesn’t seem to be much there, least of all anything living. Now why would that be? This was a story I was looking forward to re-reading for these extended reviews of Best New Horror because, when I’d read it originally, and despite enjoying the pleasingly chill Aickmanesque atmosphere it generated, there was something about the story that didn’t quite click. A second read happily sorted all that out. On the evidence of this story, I might have to seek out a couple of dark comedy thrillers he later wrote, Seeing The Wires and Execution Plan – assuming it’s the same bloke.)\n\nBack Of Beyond – Cherry Wilder (3/5 – The Mandevilles are tempted out of retirement to help Mary Boyd, a wealthy woman who is desperate to locate her missing son. Vivien Mandeville is a sensitive, capable of reading an incredible amount of detail and history from the objects she handles. Her husband, Albert, acts as her straight-man. When the Mandevilles reach the Boyd residence, they find themselves stalked from afar, and are given an ominous warning by an old Aboriginal to let sleeping dogs lie. This was okay, with Wilder creating a great double act in the Mandevilles, but the ending disappointed.)\n\nA Hundred Little Wicked Witches – Steve Rasnic Tem (4/5 – Jack sees witches everywhere. They judge him, criticise him, mock him. When they are not expressing seemingly every aspect of his life, they are controlling it. When Jack meets Marsha, he is astonished to find that she wants to get to know him and seems willing look past all the witches he sees. But can he? This is a playful short from SRT “witches” spoiled only by an ending that felt abrupt and overly harsh.)\n\nThe Finger Of Halugra – Manly Wade Wellman (4/5 – You might wonder how a posthumous entry from an author who had passed away nearly a decade earlier could make it into a book called Best New Horror, but who cares about such trifling technicalities when the story is this good? The improbably named Sugg Harpole is hired by an unsavoury sort called The Greek to locate and retrieve the titular finger. The statue of Halugra is to be found somewhere up in the mountains, and the neighbouring Native Americans believe its finger has remarkable healing qualities. Turns out it does, but it seems the statue is rather attached to it. While this story was predictable, it was also a lot of fun, reading like an old horror comic strip from a bygone age.)\n\nThe Toddler – Terry Lamsley (4/5 – Haddon Hall is a place with a dark history. Centuries ago the monstrous Sir Rufford De Quintz resided there and took delight in abusing the staff in every terrible way. He sired a daughter by one of the young maids and, unusually for De Quintz, he let the child live. The toddler was subsequently tolerated but despised throughout the house. Fast forward to 1995 and Myra Cooper is spearheading the renovation of Haddon Hall. She is called to investigate a gruesome discovery bricked up in one of the walls. This was another winner from Lamsley, who is somehow able to document the most horrific things with an astonishing lightness of touch. This was the mirror opposite of his previous entry, Blade and Bone (Best New Horror 6) in that the build-up throughout this story was terrific, but was let down by the ending.)\n\nNot Here, Not Now – Stephen Gallagher (4/5 – A quick in-and-out from Gallagher which sees a hit-and-run driver get his comeuppance in a suitably ironic way. There’s no messing about with this one.)\n\nThe Bungalow House – Thomas Ligotti (4/5 – A return to form for Ligotti in a Stoker-nominated story where a man is enchanted by an installation at his local grotty art gallery. The artwork takes the form of an audio recording describing in striking detail a dream of the artist in which he is trapped inside an unlit bungalow house in the dead of night while all kinds of weird and horrible vermin lie dead or dying at his feet. The imagery the recording creates in our man is so vivid that he simply must know more about the artist responsible, as much as it may bother Dahla, the gallery’s owner. The prose is as lush and the plot is as weird as ever. The story is perhaps let down by two things: first, Dahla’s character often spills over caricature and into parody; second, I saw the twist coming. Still a good read, though.)\n\nCradle – Alan Brennert (4/5 – Marguerite wants to have a baby, but her vampirism has made her sterile. She uses the wealth she has accrued over the years (and years and years) to hire a surrogate, Sondra, and a team of doctors to handle all the fiddly DNA-imprinting science stuff necessary for the pregnancy to be viable. (Who knew?) The pregnancy starts out normally, but, once junior develops a heartbeat, Sondra finds that her body is having a hard time keeping up with the little bugger’s needs. This is an interesting what-if story, but I suspect the ending will divide opinion between those who consider it a neat twist on vampire myth and those who will groan and move on. I’m in the “neat twist” camp, for what it’s worth.)\n\nThe Sixth Dog – Jane Rice (3/5 – A veterinarian is creeped out by the Clanton brothers living next door. The Clantons mostly keep to themselves, which creates fertile ground for the town’s rumourmongers. Bizarrely, it is suggested the brothers are attempting to create something that could replace food. Our man isn’t convinced about that. All he knows is that the Clantons are dwindling one by one, and the burial plots out the back of their house are increasing in number. This was okay, but it’s one of those stories where the protagonist is almost entirely passive, which made him a hard person to get behind. There were other niggles too, but are probably down to my personal taste, such as dialog written as it is spoken (which I find rarely works), quirkiness replacing humour rather than complementing it, etc.)\n\nScaring The Train – Terry Dowling (3/5 – It’s 1962 and Paul and Max spend their school holidays creating and executing ever more elaborate stunts to scare the living crap out of train drivers. They observe the fruits of their endeavours each time from a safe enough distance to avoid detection. After a particularly daring prank, the pair witness a man examining the offending trackside area. The man homes in on their position with uncanny speed and precision and offers them a wave. Paul and Max are spooked by this but decide to press on with their most daring stunt yet – a final hurrah before the school holidays are through. Big mistake. This was okay, but the first half of the story – concerning events in Paul and Max’s childhood – rather outshines the second half, where they return to their old stomping ground some years later.)\n\nLa Serenissima – David Sutton (4/5 – Euphrosyne and Polyhymnia are identical twins who have been trusted in Venice to the care of their guardians, the Fortescues – their parents being much too rich to be bothering with such piffling inconveniences as parenthood. Polyhymnia is horrified to find Rudolf Fortescue laying a hand on Euphrosyne in a most inappropriate manner and is further appalled to see not only Miranda Fortescue turning a blind eye to it, but also that Euphrosyne is quite enjoying Rudolph’s attentions. To top it all, things are not as they seem in this crumbling and rotting Venice, and a clue to it all may be found in a painting called La Serenissima. This is a very nicely written story, a significant improvement on Sutton’s previous entry, Those of Rhenea (Best New Horror 2). Euphrosyne and Polyhymnia are engaging characters, identical twins yet polar opposites, and we get a good sense of the sights, sounds and smells of Venice and its grotty underbelly. And yet, in keeping with several stories in this volume, it’s the ending that disappoints, feeling a tad throwaway. Worth a look, all the same.)\n\nThe Bars On Satan’s Jailhouse – Norman Partridge (4/5 – Partridge serves up a bizarre and meaty slab of Wild West gothic in a tale which sees a Chinese girl, Lie, being sold by her father to a brutal and notorious criminal, Midas Gerlach. Midas’s ranch sits within a large amount of land, and he isn’t above slaughtering any government officials who come sniffing around his patch. Lie is being delivered to Midas courtesy of a large black man wearing strange boots made of fur, bone and razor-sharp teeth. It doesn’t turn out well for either of them. Perhaps both Lie and her courier should have heeded the warnings of the strange gun-toting coyote-man they met along the way. This weird western nabbed an International Horror Critics Guild Award back in the day. It’s grubby and clearly off its nut, but certainly worth a read. If you liked this, check out Partridge’s Guignoir (Best New Horror 3), which is another gritty treat of his.)\n\nThe Bone-Carver’s Tale – Jeff VanderMeer (3/5 – Sajit is an ageing bone-carver of great renown who is captivated by the music of a serunai player he hears drifting from a nearby village. The serunai player is a woman called Prei Chen, and the two accomplished artists finally meet when Prei seeks Sajit at his home. But Sajit finds the artist pales against the beauty of her art and so sends Prei away in tears. It is a decision he comes to regret. This was okay – VanderMeer really knows his stuff when it comes to Southeast Asian history – but the richness and sense of place he gives this story is undermined by its linearity. This may have been intentional, an attempt to give it an ancient legend vibe, but this also meant the story didn’t grab me quite as much as I’d hoped it would.)\n\nQueen Of Knives – Neil Gaiman (3/5 – In this poem, a child and his grandparents attend a variety show. The star act is a magician, and Grandad, thinking he knows it all, attempts to explain (often incorrectly) how each trick is done. For his next trick the magician picks Grandma from the crowd and rolls out a large cabinet. Once Grandma is secured inside the cabinet, out come the knives. This does the business but doesn’t cover any new ground.\n\nAlso, if poems\n\nwith seemingly random line\n\nbreaks leave you cold and bemused,\n\nthis probably isn’t going to turn you a-\n\n-round.)\n\nThe True History Of Dr Pretorius – Paul J. McAuley (3/5 – Larry Cochrane is a celebrated journalist of the “attack dog” variety, and he’s got the notorious Dr Pretorius in his sights. Cochrane knows Pretorius possesses the secret to near-immortality and is determined to coerce it from him, no matter what it takes. The only problem is Pretorius seems quite comfortable admitting to the misdeeds of his past – well, most of them anyway. This was okay, but not as good as The Temptation of Dr Stein, McAuley’s previous Pretorius story from Best New Horror 6. It’s hard to know what McAuley was trying to achieve here. I’m willing to believe he’s merely having a lot of fun with the mad scientist genre, but by name-dropping nearly every fictional mad scientist in literature as either a friend or understudy of Pretorius, the story comes across a bit “me too”. Cochrane is also too much of a bad guy, bordering on pantomime at times.)\n\nThe Grey Madonna – Graham Masterton (4/5 – Shades of Don’t Look Now abound as Dean, a wealthy American tourist, returns to Bruges three years after his wife, Karen, was found dead there with a broken neck. A sole witness recalls how Karen was arguing with a nun shortly before her death, and that the nun was wearing a light grey habit at the time. Dean is determined to track down the nun. He finds he doesn’t have far to look. While predictable, this still delivered a satisfying tingle down the spine.)\n\nLoop – Douglas E. Winter (4/5 – In this International Horror Critics Guild Award winner we observe legal eagle and keen dick-flick enthusiast Delacorte’s growing obsession for a porn actress. Initially he sees her only briefly at the end of a looped movie in a pay-as-you-go porn booth. As her porn career takes off, so does Delacorte’s and he spunks a lot of time and money collecting everything she has starred in. Every last bit of it. This was good, comfortably the author’s best story in Best New Horror, but you’ll probably spend the first three-quarters of this wondering when Winter is going to get his hands out of his pants and get on with telling the story. Also, the regular switching between second and third person is a flimsy attempt to make the reader feel complicit in Delacorte’s hairy-palmed hobby. Sorry, Doug, you’re on your own there.)\n\nThe Hunger And Ecstasy Of Vampires – Brian Stableford (3/5 – Edward Copplestone is an ageing adventurer who gathers an eccentric gaggle of real-life and fictional nineteenth century minds to hear and perchance discuss an in-depth account of his latest expedition: a drug-induced step… INTO THE FUTUUUUUURRRRE!!! Across three separate visions, Copplestone recounts increasingly advanced and fantastic futures, but they are all based upon one uncomfortable fact: that it’s vampires that take civilisation forward, not mankind. Which is music to the ears of a certain Count Lugard in attendance. This short novel is comfortably the longest story in the book, but it doesn’t quite earn its page count. It’s not a bad story by any means. I liked a good chunk of what it was trying to do, but the moment each guest – and I mean each and every one of them – began rubbing their chin and offering their take upon what they had heard, that was about the moment I began wishing the story would end. Interestingly, this story looks to have fallen victim to an extension of copyright periods in the UK during the mid-90s, in that every mention of a certain consulting detective and sidekick in the story had to be shown as S******k H***** and Doctor W*****. (Their names are intact in the issues of Interzone that featured this story originally.) Hats off to Jones for keeping this in the book, though, when it would have been a lot easier to drop it.)\n\nLacuna – Nicolas Royle (4/5 – After a 30-odd-thousand-word monster, we close the book on a one-pager, and a rare thing indeed: a mood piece that works, and not only that but one told in the second person! If you’ve ever missed an hour or two while in the house or have ever sensed there’s someone “other” keeping you company, then this one is for you.)\n\nAnd so we reach the end of another Best New Horror review. Thanks for reading! If you are tempted by any of the stories then you should be able to find a second-hand copy of Best New Horror 7 on the interwebs without too much trouble. Alternatively, most eBook outlets will have a crisp, digital copy awaiting your purchase. The cover images in the above review will take you over to Goodreads, where you might find further avenues to explore.\n\nThanks again for reading. I’ll see you later for a whizz through book 8.\n\nLP\n\nIn a word, UGH! I think it’s safe to say I didn’t get on with this one. This is a setter that I’ll never quite get, with several tells that rub me the wrong way. Still, I persevered and got there in the end. You can find my completed grid below along with (occasionally caustic) explanations where I have them.\n\nAs ever, some housekeeping before we begin: if you have a recent Times Jumbo Cryptic that’s left you baffled, then you might find my Just For Fun page useful. If horror fiction is your thing, then my Reviews page has a few tasty morsels for you. I’ll put up another review shortly for Best New Horror 7, as it’s been a while.\n\nRight, I won’t keep you any longer. Onto the solution. I hope you find it helpful!\n\nLP\n\nAcross clues\n\n1. Like an old maid with unserviceable cooker (6)\n\nAnswer: PRIMUS, a brand-named “cooker”. Solution is PRIM (i.e. “like an old maid”) followed by US (a recognised abbreviation of “unserviceable”). It never sits right when a setter chucks a product name in their grid. Yes, this one is in the dictionary, but still…\n\n5. Scraps a few words in speech (7)\n\nAnswer: AFFRAYS (i.e. “scraps”). “In speech” indicates the solution is a homophone of A PHRASE (i.e. “a few words”).\n\n9. Check canine? (8)\n\nAnswer: DOGTOOTH. I’m taking issue with this one, but let’s play along with the setter for a second. The clue supposedly riffs on how the solution is both a broken “check” pattern used in some tweeds, as well as a “canine” tooth. Trouble is, my Chambers has this as DOGSTOOTH (houndstooth is another such pattern). It has entirely different definitions for DOGTOOTH. I’m assuming dictionaries differ on this, so there’s only one way to solve this situation… FIGHT!!!!\n\n13.

Solution is CON (i.e. “with Italian”, i.e. the Italian for “with”) followed by FED and ATE (i.e. “scoffed twice”) which is placed “about” ER (i.e. “first lady”, as in the Queen, or Elizabeth Regina), like so: CON-FED-(ER)-ATE.\n\n11. Wind up eating this at Ship and get sozzled (9)\n\nAnswer: SPAGHETTI (i.e. “wind up eating” – referring to how you’d twist the stuff on your fork before giving up, shoving what you can in your mouth and slurping the rest down, splattering tomato sauce everywhere.

Solution is LEO (i.e. “cat” – referring to the sign of the zodiac, being a lion) placed in TEST (i.e. a “river” in Hampshire – I wonder if, during last year’s prolonged heat wave, it suffered a “dry run”. Geddit? No? Just me again then…), like so: TE(LEO)ST. I liked the clue somewhat more than the solution.\n\n22. Little lad swallowing fly (8)\n\nAnswer: SMIDGEON (i.e. “little” – there are a few variant forms of the word “smidgen” it transpires). Solution is SON (i.e. “lad”) wrapped around or “swallowing” MIDGE (i.e. “fly”), like so: S(MIDGE)ON.\n\n24.

Solution is an anagram (indicated by “dashed”) of SATANIC HITLERS and E (i.e. “scheme finally”, i.e. the last letter of “scheme”). Good lord, this took me ages to spot, despite having scribbled “___ in the air” early on in the puzzle.\n\n26. Approach open river (8)\n\nAnswer: OVERTURE (i.e. “approach” – an overture being the beginning of something, typically a musical composition).

Solution is G (a recognised abbreviation of “good”) followed by ER (i.e. “monarch”, specifically Elizabeth Regina), then M (a recognised abbreviation of “married”) and then ANY (i.e. “even”, I guess, though I can’t visualise a sentence where you’d substitute one for the other – maybe I need to sleep on it), like so: G-ER-M-ANY.\n\n48.

As mentioned in previous posts, though, I don’t mind toughies so long as I’m camped out in a dictionary and not an atlas or past issues of The Lancet. So a good puzzle, all told, despite its chewiness.\n\nYou’ll find my completed grid below with explanations of my solutions where I have them. I hope you find them helpful. If you have an old grid that’s showing a few gaps then my Just For Fun page might also help you out. I’m also working my way through Stephen Jones’s Best New Horror series – because, hell, why not? – reviews of which you can find on my Reviews page. A review of book seven will be coming soon, all being well.\n\nAlrighty then, let’s get on with the show.\n\nLP\n\nAcross clues\n\n1.

It’s in the dictionary, yes, but it sounds like the kind of thing someone would say when they can’t think of the word “mechanic”.\n\n13. Hard to charge VAT and give credit (5)\n\nAnswer: THANK (i.e. “to give credit”). Solution is TANK (i.e. “vat” – ignore the misleading capitalisation) which is surrounding or being “charged” by H (a recognised abbreviation of “hard”), like so: T(H)ANK.\n\n14.

Solution is SET (i.e. “placed”) followed “by” NAN (i.e. “bread”, specifically an alternative spelling of “naan” also seen later in 34a) and both reversed (indicated by “knocking back”), like so: NAN-TES.\n\n19. Harmless and in NI wise to vote Conservative (8)\n\nAnswer: NONTOXIC (i.e. “harmless”). Solution is NI wrapped around ONTO (i.e. “wise to”) and X (i.e. “vote”) and then followed by C (a recognised abbreviation of “Conservative”), like so: N(ONTO-X)I-C.\n\n21. Reckons detective sergeant in court is after promotion (4,2)\n\nAnswer: ADDS UP (i.e. “reckons”). Solution is DS (a recognised abbreviation of “detective sergeant”) and UP (i.e. “in court”, as in “up in front of the judge”) both placed “after” AD (i.e. “promotion”, as in a recognised abbreviation of “advertisement”), like so: AD-DS-UP.\n\n24. Crosses from island – vintage craft initially makes fast crossing (10)\n\nAnswer: CRUCIFIXES (i.e. “crosses”). I reckon the solution comprises CRU (i.e. “vintage [champagne]”), C (i.e. “craft initially”, as in the first letter of “craft”), I (a recognised abbreviation of “island”) and FIXES (i.e. “makes fast”), like so: CRU-C-I-FIXES. I can’t see how this all scans in the clue, however, and it leaves “crossing” rather redundant, so I might not have that right.\n\n[EDIT: Having slept on it, I can now see how this one scans. “Crossing” indicates the assorted elements making up the latter half of the clue are wrapped around I (i.e. “island”), like so: CRU-C-(I)-FIXES. Phew! – LP]\n\n26. Cheat: They don’t or I’d explode! (2,3,5,2)\n\nAnswer: DO THE DIRTY ON (i.e. “cheat”). “Explode” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of THEY DONT OR ID.\n\n29. Film balloonist: we understand what makes that difficult? (4)\n\nAnswer: Phileas FOGG (i.e. “balloonist” of Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days). Within the context of the clue, it would be difficult to film Fogg through fog. Something like that, anyway. Not a classic.\n\n30. Leave person with king, one nipping outside (8)\n\nAnswer: BREXITER (i.e. “leave person”, as in someone who voted for Britain to exit the European Union). Solution is REX (Latin for “king”) surrounded by or having “outside” BITER (i.e. “one nipping”), like so: B(REX)ITER. Hmm. I wasn’t aware this had made it into the dictionary already. I hope they’ve expanded the definitions for “gammon” as well, as that particular nom de guerre has rather passed me by.\n\n31. What’s needed for radio broadcasts to flourish: musicians (8)\n\nAnswer: WAVEBAND (i.e. “what’s needed for radio broadcasts”). Solution is WAVE (i.e. “to flourish” – think of this more in terms of flourishing a weapon rather than doing well) followed by BAND (i.e. “musicians”).\n\n34. Note carefully studied after taking in an Indian menu item (3,5)\n\nAnswer: NAN BREAD (i.e. “Indian menu item” – can be spelled “nan” or “naan”).

Solution is HOOT (i.e. “as owls do”) surrounded by (indicated by “about”) an anagram (indicated by “moving”) of PUSS, like so: UPS(HOOT)S. Another rather well-worked clue.\n\n45. Far from fresh aniseed drink: time for a second? (4,2)\n\nAnswer: PAST IT (i.e. “far from fresh”). Solution is PASTIS (i.e. “aniseed drink” – a new one on me) with the final S (a recognised abbreviation of “second”) swapped for a T (ditto “time”). Another good clue!\n\n49. Garden pest munched all around reserve valve in channel (10)\n\nAnswer: SLUICEGATE (i.e. “valve in channel”). Solution is SLUG (i.e. “garden pest” – tsk, don’t I know it. My poor chillies!) and ATE (i.e. “munched”) placed “around” ICE (i.e. “reserve”, as in having an icy nature), like so: SLU(ICE)G-ATE.\n\n51. The press the object of such false adulation? (8,4)\n\nAnswer: CUPBOARD LOVE, which, according to my Chambers, is a “hypocritical show of affection for material gain” (i.e. “false adulation”). Fair enough. I can’t see how this relates to the rest of the clue, however. Anyone?\n\n[EDIT: A big thank you to Lee in the comments for shedding some light on this one. – LP]\n\n53. Local taxi company in time (7)\n\nAnswer: AUBERGE (i.e. an inn or “local” – also my favourite song by Chris Rea, because you needed to know that). Solution is UBER (i.e. “taxi company”) placed “in” AGE (i.e. “time”), like so: A(UBER)GE.\n\n54. Six pitied for forging uncorroborated statement (4,5)\n\nAnswer: IPSE DIXIT, which is Latin for “he himself said it” (i.e. “uncorroborated statement”). “For forging” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of SIX PITIED. Latin not being my first language, I had to fall back on the rather obvious wordplay and a fair amount of thumbing through my Chambers to find the solution.\n\n55. Palm lacerated after spinning bottles (5)\n\nAnswer: ARECA (i.e. “palm” – one for the botanists out there). “Bottles” indicates the solution is hidden in the clue, while “spinning” indicates the solution has been reversed, like so: L(ACERA)TED.

Solution is MEANS (i.e. “method”) being “pursued” by UN (i.e. “peacekeepers”, specifically the United Nations). Another nod to my Chambers, though the wordplay made it fairly easy to deduce.\n\n3. Maybe go for a constitutional approach with article and broadcast (4,3,3)\n\nAnswer: TAKE THE AIR (i.e. “maybe go for a constitutional”). Solution is TAKE (i.e. “approach”) followed by THE (i.e. “article”) and AIR (i.e. “broadcast”).\n\n4. Close bank up in the city (6)\n\nAnswer: NEARBY (i.e. “close”).

One for the p(l)ot? (9,3)\n\nAnswer: GUNPOWDER TEA. No, me neither.

Time for a speech, pithy, in separate ways, and light (2,8,3)\n\nAnswer: ST CRISPIN’S DAY. Solution refers to a scene from Shakespeare’s Henry V in which the titular king gives a speech on St Crispin’s Day. Don’t worry, I don’t do Shakespeare much either. Anyway, the solution, as best as I can make it, is ST and INS (both “ways”, the former a recognised abbreviation of “street”) “separating” CRISP (i.e. terse or “pithy”) and then followed by DAY (i.e. “light”), like so: ST-CRISP-INS-DAY. Not a classic.\n\n20. Motored east, after calibrating this? (8)\n\nAnswer: ODOMETER, which measures the distance travelled by a wheeled vehicle. Solution is an anagram (indicated by “after calibrating”) of MOTORED and E (a recognised abbreviation of “east”). Within the context of the clue, you might well motor after calibrating the odometer, getting the car back in the driveway just before the guy from webuyanycar.com turns up. You get the idea.\n\n22.

Part of prison project following suggestion one’s abandoned (5,3)\n\nAnswer: DEATH ROW (i.e. “part of prison”). I’m not 100% on this one, but my solution is THROW (i.e. “project”) which “follows” DE-A (i.e. “suggestion one’s abandoned” – I guess we’re riffing on how the prefix “de-” indicates something that’s being removed, and how “a” can be “one”), like so: DE-A-THROW. Not a clue I’m keen on.\n\n28. Exit this awfully low place? (8)\n\nAnswer: SIXTIETH (i.e. “low place”). “Awfully” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of EXIT THIS.\n\n29.

Solution is X (i.e. “by” as in the multiplication symbol) followed by RAY’S (i.e. “fellow’s”), then P (i.e. “firstly plotting”, i.e. the first letter of “plotting”), then ECT (i.e. “treatment that’s shocking”, specifically Electroconvulsive Therapy), and finally RUM (i.e. “unusual”), like so: X-RAYS-P-ECT-RUM.

Solution is COR (i.e. “brother” – both taken to be exclamations) followed by UNDUM (i.e. “not silent presumably, sounding”, i.e. a homophone of “undumb” – I really wish setters would stop using non-existent words as homophones). Not a classic. I’ll admit part of this solution came from Skyrim. It rather has its hooks in me at the moment. Again.\n\n46. French writer, still with regiment, put on a uniform (7)\n\nAnswer: Henry David THOREAU. This may very well not be correct, as this particular Hank was a Yank, not French. Still, here goes. My solution is THO (i.e. “still”, as in a shortened form of “though”) followed by RE (i.e. “regiment”, specifically the Royal Engineers), then A and finally U (i.e. “uniform” – not an abbreviation explicitly recognised in my Chambers, but is used in the initials UBR – Uniform Business Rate), like so: THO-RE-A-U. Yuck, in a word.\n\n[EDIT: Lee comes to the rescue again in the comments, clarifying the U. Thanks, Lee! – LP]\n\n47. Was fitting answer being given to pig?

Solution is PS (i.e. “spy’s oddly concealed”, i.e. the odd letters removed from SPY’S) followed “by” ST (i.e. “the way”, as in a recognised abbreviation of “street”), like so: PS-ST.\n\nBlimey, the puns were strong with this one, weren’t they? Having had some distance now from solving the puzzle, I can appreciate how well a number of clues played out, but it didn’t feel that way at the time! For some reason it took me as long to solve the top-left-hand corner as it did the rest of the grid. Never mind, I got there in the end.\n\nYou can find my completed grid below, along with explanations of my solutions where I have them. I hope you find them helpful. A spot of housekeeping before we begin, in time-honoured fashion. If you have a recent Times Jumbo Cryptic Crossword for which you have a few gaps, then you might find my Just For Fun page of use. If you have a soft spot for reading horror fiction then there are a few tasty morsels in my Reviews page that might interest you. I’m currently working my way through the entire run of Best New Horror. Still a few books to go!\n\nAnyway, let’s crack on, shall we?\n\nLP\n\nAcross clues\n\n1. Head of Sixth leaving teacher in class to teach wrongly? (9)\n\nAnswer: MISINFORM (i.e. “to teach wrongly”). Solution is MISS (i.e. “teacher”) with an S removed (indicated by “Head of Sixth leaving”, i.e. the first letter of “Sixth”), then followed by IN and then FORM (i.e. “class”), like so: MIS-IN-FORM. One of a number of clues that scan rather well.\n\n6. Fat cat running courses (7)\n\nAnswer: CROESUS, a very rich man, after the King of Lydia, it says here (i.e. “fat cat”). “Running” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of COURSES. Not one I’m familiar with. Luckily the wordplay was a tad more obvious than the solution.\n\n10. Passage in tabloid is rejected (5)\n\nAnswer: SINUS (i.e. “passage”). Solution is SUN (i.e. “tabloid”) and IS both reversed (indicated by “rejected”), like so: SI-NUS.\n\n13. Information not available about what constitutes place of punishment (7)\n\nAnswer: GEHENNA, which, to quote my Chambers, is “the valley of Hinnom, near Jerusalem, in which the Israelites sacrificed their children to Moloch, and to which, at a later time, the refuse of the city was conveyed to be burned; hence hell” (i.e. “place of punishment”). Solution is GEN (i.e. “information”) and N/A (a recognised abbreviation of “not available”) placed “about” EH (i.e. “what”, as in “I beg your pardon?”), like so: G(EH)EN-NA. How times change. Nowadays, hell is that scary little shit off the AA adverts murdering Proud Mary every ten minutes. Maybe that’s just me.\n\n14. Block digital protection (5)\n\nAnswer: STALL. Solution satisfies “block” and “digital protection” – a stall being a covering for a finger. You’ll sometimes see sporty types wear them to protect their pinkies.\n\n15.

Bird having ring ouzel’s head and eagle’s tail (6)\n\nAnswer: HOOPOE (i.e. “bird” – did a Google Image search – it looks like the kind of thing I’d have doodled when I was eight years old, i.e. a bit bonkers.) Solution is HOOP (i.e. “ring”) followed by O (i.e. “ouzel’s head”, i.e. the first letter of “ouzel”) and E (i.e. “eagle’s tail”, i.e. the last letter of “eagle”).\n\n18.

Clue plays on how “soldiers” can also mean strips of bread used to dunk into soft-boiled eggs, and how “shell” can refer to both artillery and the outer casing of an egg. You get the idea.\n\n19. Paint a pack of hounds with vermin cut off (7)\n\nAnswer: ACRYLIC (i.e. “paint”). Solution is A then CRY (i.e. “pack of hounds”) and LICE (i.e. “vermin” – the term applies to insects as well as small animals) with the last letter removed (indicated by “cut off”), like so: A-CRY-LIC.\n\n22. Scruffy pair? Mend it and press (5,5)\n\nAnswer: PRINT MEDIA (i.e. “[the] press”). “Scruffy” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of PAIR MEND IT. This took me way longer than it ought to, despite seeing early doors that this was going to be an anagram. I struggled even when I had all the intersecting letters completed. Sometimes I just don’t see ’em.\n\n23. No right to get Chemistry, say, without one’s submission (12)\n\nAnswer: ACQUIESCENCE (i.e. “submission”). Solution is ACQUIRE (i.e. “to get”) with the R removed (indicated by “no right”, R being a recognised abbreviation of “right”) and then followed by SCIENCE (i.e. “Chemistry, perhaps”) with the I removed (indicated by “without [Roman numeral] one”), like so: ACQUIE-SCENCE.\n\n27.

Mobile or mikes for bugging (7)\n\nAnswer: IRKSOME (i.e. “bugging”). “Mobile” indicates anagram. Solution is an anagram of OR MIKES. Another seemingly obvious anagram that took me longer than it should.\n\n30. Not initially fleeced, smaller lamb will be (8)\n\nAnswer: HORNLESS (i.e. “lamb will be”).

A rather well-worked clue.\n\n39. Not a landowner – one with under a dozen workers? (6,6)\n\nAnswer: TENANT FARMER, as in one who rents a farm (i.e. “not a landowner”). Solution plays on how “workers” can be ants, and with less than a dozen of them this could make our farmer a TEN ANT FARMER.\n\n41. Artist’s endless row with journalist ultimately in newspapers (10)\n\nAnswer: SCULPTRESS (i.e. “artist”). Solution is SCULL (i.e. “row [a boat]”) with the last letter removed (indicated by “endless”) and followed by T (i.e. “journalist ultimately”, i.e. the last letter of “journalist”) once it has been placed “in” PRESS (i.e. “newspapers”), like so: SCUL-P(T)RESS.\n\n44. Potter receiving stick for Black going down? (3,4)\n\nAnswer: CUE BALL (i.e. “potter”). Within the context of the clue, a CUE BALL would be struck by the cue – i.e. “receiving stick” – in order for the “black [ball] going down”. You get the idea.\n\n46. Sap parasites returning to infest wood, edges chewed off (8)\n\nAnswer: IMBECILE (i.e. “sap”). Solution is LICE (i.e. “parasites”) reversed (indicated by “returning”) and “infesting” or placed inside TIMBER (i.e. “wood”) with the first and last letters removed (indicated by “edges chewed off”), like so: IMB(ECIL)E.

Solution is an anagram (indicated by “resolved”) of PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO RID which is then followed by R (i.e. “content of art”, i.e. the middle letter of “art”).\n\n53. Pony tour down to exclude beginners? That’ll be without me! (2,4,3)\n\nAnswer: ON YOUR OWN (i.e. “that’ll be without me”). “Exclude beginners” indicates the solution can be derived by removing the initial letters of PONY TOUR DOWN.\n\n54. Useless writer held back by sex (5)\n\nAnswer: INEPT (i.e. “useless”). Solution is PEN (i.e. “writer”) reversed and contained within (indicated by “held back by”) IT (i.e. “sex”, as in “doing it”, “having it off”, “at it like knives” and so forth), like so: I(NEP)T.\n\n55. Append final note – one of these? (7)\n\nAnswer: ADDENDA. Solution is ADD (i.e. “append”) followed by END (i.e. “final”) and A (i.e. “[musical] note”). Within the context of the clue, addenda could comprise appended final notes. A nice bit of recursion there.\n\n56. Quaint end of old cloth (5)\n\nAnswer: TWEED (i.e. “cloth”). Solution is TWEE (i.e. “quaint”) followed by D (i.e. “end of old”, i.e. the last letter of “old”).\n\n57. Unconscious after drink having to leave society? (4,3)\n\nAnswer: DROP OUT (i.e. “to leave society”). Solution is OUT (i.e. “unconscious”) placed “after” DROP (i.e. “drink”).\n\n58. Soldier to change sides twice (6,3)\n\nAnswer: DESERT RAT (i.e. “soldier” – you can check why from the last time it appeared a fortnight ago). Solution riffs on how DESERT and RAT are both words meaning “to change sides”. A good clue, despite how recently the solution has been repeated.\n\nDown clues\n\n1. Study of foolish character on horse (3,2)\n\nAnswer: MUG UP (i.e. “[to] study” – not one I’m familiar with, but it’s there in the dictionary). Solution is MUG (i.e. “foolish character”) followed by UP (i.e. “on horse”).\n\n2. Swingball in one’s backyard? (6,2,9)\n\nAnswer: SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, which is “any region where one nation has a dominant influence”. Taking influence to mean “swing” and sphere to mean “ball”, I guess that means said region is “one’s backyard”. I can’t decide whether I like this clue or whether it’s too smug for its own good.\n\n3. Over-protective, vigorously criticise butter (5,4)\n\nAnswer: NANNY GOAT (i.e. “butter”, as in a thing that headbutts – I audibly groaned when this finally clicked. A few swear words may have slipped out too.) Solution is NANNY (i.e. “over-protective”) followed by [have a…] GO AT (i.e. “vigorously criticise”).\n\n4. Speaker setting out opposing sides of argument between two alternatives (6)\n\nAnswer: ORATOR (i.e. “speaker”). Solution is AT (i.e. “opposing sides of argument”, i.e. the first and last letters of “argument”) placed “between” OR and OR (i.e. “two alternatives”), like so: OR-AT-OR.

Solution satisfies “give bribe, perhaps” and “source of cosmetic ingredient”, specifically palm oil, weirdly enough.\n\n8.

Solution is BO (i.e. “nasty smell”, specifically a recognised abbreviation of “body odour”) placed “between” SCAR (another name for a “cliff”) and ROUGH (i.e. “unpleasant”), like so: SCAR-BO-ROUGH.

Solution is HIP (i.e. “fruit”, specifically a rosehip) followed by PO (i.e. “Italian flower”, specifically the River Po). I was wise to the punning by this point.\n\n20.
