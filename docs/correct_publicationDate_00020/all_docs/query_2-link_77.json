        "meta_description": "Soon after completing her graduate studies in psychology, due to the spiritual nature of her personal experiences, Dr. Prentice found the world of secular psychology lacking—she…and her patients needed “something more”. So, she set out to investigate and explore alternative methods in the field of mental health that would incorporate that “something special” she believed existed in each and every individual soul. Her journey would take her through the great religions of the world as well as to a discovery of ancient, time proven alternatives to modern therapeutic models of counseling. Her studies and experiences led her to seek out alternative learning centers which incorporated a much more spiritual approach to mental health. Dr. Prentice firmly believes that if one is not Spiritually healthy then it is nearly impossible to enjoy emotional, psychological or physical health.     Dr. Prentice is in private practice as a Licensed Clinical Pastoral Counselor-Advanced Certification. She is also a Board-Certified Spiritual Counselor (SC-C) and holds Board Certification in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Group Therapy, Individual and Integrated Marriage and Family Therapy, and Crisis and Abuse Therapy. She is also a Board-Certified Temperament Counselor.  Dr. Prentice is a Professional Member of the American Counselors Association, a Professional Clinical member of the National Christian Counselors Association, a Clinical member of the American Mental Health Counselors Association and a Presidential member of the American Association of Christian Counselors. She is also a Commissioned minister of Pastoral Care.  Her commitment to the health and well-being of the Spiritual nature of her patients has led to her being called “an empath”, “a mind reader”, “a healer”, “a spiritual guide” by her patients.  Her highly sensitive, intuitive, and compassionate nature, her unique approach to therapy, and her truly empathic ways have engendered a loving and fiercely loyal following among her patients and friends.",
