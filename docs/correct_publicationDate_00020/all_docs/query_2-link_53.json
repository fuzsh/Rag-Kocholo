        "text": "Let’s start off by addressing the enormous elephant in the room – the fact that this post [which I’ve been teasing for ages] is WAY overdue. As in two months overdue. Whoops.\n\nI think we can all agree that 2020 was a weird year and by the end of it, I just needed a break.\n\nBut, despite the fact that 2020 was an actual dumpster fire, today we’re taking a look back at all the books that saved everything. Because let’s face it, while the world went to shit, we were graced with some truly amazing books. Some got me through quarantine, others through post-lockdown exhaustion.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, let’s celebrate the best books of 2020…\n\nBest Book of 2020 – Crescent City: House of Earth and Blood by Sarah J. Maas\n\nBest Standalone of 2020 – Journey to the River Sea by Eva Ibbotson\n\nBest Classic of 2020 – A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens\n\nMost Binge Worthy Series of 2020 – The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer\n\nFavorite Book Couple of 2020 – Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, Midnight Sun by Stephenie Meyer\n\nBest Romance of 2020 – Well Met by Jen DeLuca\n\nBest Fantasy Book of 2020 – Serpent and Dove by Shelby Mahurin\n\nBest Science Fiction Book of 2020 – The Other Side of the Sky by Amie Kaufman & Meagan Spooner\n\nBest Re-Read of 2020 – The Cruel Prince by Holly Black\n\nWorst Book of 2020 – Crave by Tracy Wolff"
