        "text": "A captivating chronicle of an amazing journey, Sailing by Starlight is recommended for sailors and history buffs alike.\n\n-- \"Windcheck Magazine\"\n\nA full and captivating picture of this complex man. . . . Kudos to Scher for writing a book that gives Creamer the voice he deserves in sailing history and that invites all of us to think a bit differently next time we are on the water we love.\n\n-- \"Sail Magazine\"\n\nSailing by Starlight takes what could have easily be-come one more nondescript sailing-around-the-world tale and makes it into a thoroughly researched and well-written book that's as much about problem-solving and strength of character as it is about adventure.\n\n-- \"Sailing\"\n\nScher does a superb job of making ocean sailing and its terminology accessible and easy to understand for those who do not do it themselves, while keeping the story moving for those of us who do. Sailing by Starlight fills a major gap in sailing narrative literature, relating the story of a man and his phenomenal voyage which have been undeservedly little known.\n\n-- \"Flying Fish: The Journal of the Ocean Cruising Club\""
