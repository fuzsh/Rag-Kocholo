The boys had planned to go up to camp together that winter -- their first trip without Nate's survival-savvy father. When Nate decides to make the treacherous journey to his family's remote camp at Ghost Lake alone, it's half pilgrimage, half desperate hope he'll find a trace of his lost friend when no one else could. Instead he finds his family's camp occupied by strangers -- men who've escaped from a maximum-security prison. How could they have known about the cabin? Nate's survival now depends on both his wits and his skill as an outdoorsman. As the situation spirals out of control, Nate finds himself dealing with questions even bigger than who gets to leave camp alive.\" --from dust jacket.",
