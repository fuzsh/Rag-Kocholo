Most modern productions employ campiness or sound effects to try to bring back that gothic tension, but we've tried something different. By returning to Stoker's original storytelling structure - a series of letters and journal entries voiced by Jonathan Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and other characters - with an all-star cast of narrators, we've sought to recapture its originally intended horror and power.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nIS THAT NOT SO?\n\nBy Jim \"The Impatient\" on 11-05-15\n\nAll the Ugly and Wonderful Things\n\nA Novel\n\nBy: Bryn Greenwood\n\nNarrated by: Jorjeana Marie\n\nLength: 11 hrs and 8 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 20,143\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 18,306\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 18,256\n\nAs the daughter of a drug dealer, Wavy knows not to trust people, not even her own parents. It's safer to keep her mouth shut and stay out of sight. Struggling to raise her little brother, Donal, eight-year-old Wavy is the only responsible adult around. Obsessed with the constellations, she finds peace in the starry night sky above the fields behind her house until one night her stargazing causes an accident. After witnessing his motorcycle wreck, she forms an unusual friendship with one of her father's thugs, Kellen, a tattooed ex-con with a heart of gold.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nSo many 'hard to listen to' moments\n\nBy jksullycats on 12-27-16\n\nTwo More Days\n\nAn Anthology\n\nBy: Colleen Hoover, Aileen Erin\n\nNarrated by: Nicholas Tecosky, Marissa Hampton, Edward Thomas, and others\n\nLength: 24 hrs and 49 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars 621\n\nPerformance\n\n4 out of 5 stars 552\n\nStory\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars 548\n\nThe Bookworm Box is proud to present Two More Days, our second anthology installment.
