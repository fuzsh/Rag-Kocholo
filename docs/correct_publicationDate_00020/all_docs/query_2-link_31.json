A group of human prisoners escape from a hi-tech alien prison, only to find themselves enmeshed in a war between two alien races for control of the human past, the key to which lies buried in the time of the Italian Renaissance. A rich story of time travel, aliens and alternate history. The Great Wheel\n\nIan R. MacLeod\n\nHarcourt Brace hard cover\n\nFirst novel from the noted short story writer. In 2170, the Endless City occupies the entire coast of North Africa. Global warming and climate control have created perpetual cloud cover. Father John Alston offers the people who live in squalor on the city borders as much spiritual comfort aid as he can. But when he discovers that the koiyl leaf chewed by the border people may be causing cancer, it triggers an investigation which leads to a surprising trail. Voyages by Starlight\n\nIan R. MacLeod\n\nArkham House hard cover\n\nAnother fine collection from Arkham House, this one featuring the author of The Great Wheel.\n\nArt: Mark Salwowski\n\nThe Cassini Division\n\nKen MacLeod\n\nTor (hardcover, 240 pages, $22.95 US)\n\nPublication date: July 15, 1999\n\nKen MacLeod has been compared to Bruce Sterling, and Iain Banks in his native Britain. This is his first novel released in the US. \"Ellen May Ngewthu is a young woman with centuries of experience, a soldier and leader of the elite defense force of the utopian Solar Union. In the twenty-fourth century the forts of the Division, in orbit around a mysteriously transformed Jupiter, are the front line in humanity's long standoff with the unknowable posthumans -- godlike and remote beings descended from those who transformed themselves with high technology centuries ago. The posthumans' capacities are unknown... but we know they disintegrated Ganymede, punched a wormhole into Jovian space, and altered the very surface of the solar system's largest planet with their incomprehensible artifacts. Worst of all, we know that they have been bombarding the solar system with powerful data viruses for generations. Now Ellen has a plan to rid humanity of this threat once and for all. Her quest will take her to the mid-Atlantic towers of Solar Union Earth, to the green ruins of London, and to the long-separated libertarian colony of New Mars. In the process, much will be revealed -- about history, about power, and about what it is to be human.\" The Stone Canal\n\nKen MacLeod\n\nLegend hard cover\n\nJonathan Wilde, a 21st century anarchist agitator is dead, but his memory is immortal. Now that memory is stored in his clone, a young man who is searching for the man who killed him. From the author of The Star Fraction. Kingdom Come\n\nElliot S. Maggin, art by Alex Ross\n\nWarner Aspect hard cover\n\nKingdom Come was an epic DC Comics series with some truly impressive art by Chicago artist Alex Ross. Now novelist Maggin, author of the bestselling Last Son of Krypton, brings us the novelization. It's early in the 21st century, and a new generation of young superheroes is threatening to tear the world apart... until the Man of Steel returns from self-imposed exile to forge a group of champions to bring the world back from the brink. With new colour plates by Alex Ross. Heart of the Hero\n\nRickey R. Mallory\n\nNew Concepts Publishing (Web novel, 250 pages, disk or download, $3.99 US)\n\nPublication date: January 1998\n\nWe don't usually list Web fiction. The ability for anyone with a keyboard and a discount HTML text to post their unpublished manuscript has brought a new definition to the words \"vanity press,\" and much of it isn't worth the electrons it's printed on. Still, there are certainly exceptions. New Concepts Publishing is striving to bring some hard-fought recognition to this maligned sub-genre, and they're slowly succeeding. With Rickey Mallory's \"future romantic suspense\" novel, Heart of the Hero, they may have found a winner. It's received a 5-star review from Affaire de Coeur, the download version is now listed at Amazon.com, and Tom Easton of Analog says, \"If that downloading public wants a science fiction romance, they should love this one.\" \"A hero's welcome awaited Danny White when he returned home. But the space station accident had cost him more than the numerous operations and months of recuperation he'd had to endure. It had cost him all the memories of his past life. He knew nothing of the person he had been or the family he'd left behind. All he knew was that when his wife looked at him, fear darkened her eyes. And the more Danny learned about the man he had been, the less he wanted to find that man's memories inside himself.\" Available on disk or download for $3.99. Wingman: The Circle War\n\nJack Maloney\n\nZebra/Pinnacle\n\nStar Wars: Essential Guide to Characters\n\nAndy Mangel\n\nDel Rey trade paper\n\nIn large format, the guide has culled characters from all Star Wars licensed fiction and non-fiction.\n\nArt: Clidd Nielson\n\nDawn Song\n\nMichael Marano\n\nTor (hardcover, 398 pages, $24.95 US/$34.95 Canada)\n\nPublication date: June 1998\n\nAn ambitious first novel from a medieval historian who specialized in the Kabbalah and alchemic lore (and it shows). Belial, the Unbowed One, the horned prince who strives endlessly for the beauty of a future filled with despair, is at war with another great power of Hell -- Leviathan, the Enfolded One, an enormous armoured worm, a blind idiot which seeks only the perpetuation of ugliness. The latest theatre for their eternal battle: Boston, 1990, at the dawn of the Gulf War. Lawrence has newly arrived in the city, determined to make a new life for himself but struggling with guilt over his father's death and a breakup with his lover. When a powerful shape-changing succubus, a newborn agent of Belial, chooses the top of Lawrence's building as her home, events begin to tumble towards destiny...\n\nReview by Victoria Strauss\n\nDoug Beekman\n\nThe Jackal of Nar (Tyrants and Kings, Book 1)\n\nJohn Marco\n\nBantam Spectra (trade paperback, 660 pages, $14.95/$22.95 Can)\n\nPublication date: March 9, 1999\n\nFirst volume in a new fantasy series from a debut author. Looks very intriguing. \"This masterful debut of a military fantasy series probes the emotional landscapes and moral dilemmas of a reluctant warrior, the brave yet sensitive Richius Vantran. Ordered by the Emperor to halt a revolt by a religious faction, Vantran's success wins him both Imperial favor and a wife -- though neither sits well with him. For in battle, he fell in love with a member of the very religious faction he put down. Torn between duty and passion, Vantran surprises himself by choosing to love the enemy--and march against his old companions.\"\n\nReview by Victoria Strauss\n\nAll the Other Things I Really Need to Know I Learned from Watching Star Trek: The Next Generation\n\nDave Marinaccio\n\nPocket hard cover\n\nAuthor of (in case you couldn't guess) the previous bestseller, All I Really Need to Know I Learned From Watching Star Trek. Armchair philosopher Marinaccio takes readers on another lighthearted tour of the human condition, mapped across the adventures of Captain Picard, Riker, Data, Worf and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-D (as well as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager). Drawing on anecdotes from his own life he offers new observations on life's everyday challenges, inspired by the Emmy Award-winning series.\n\nJohn Jude Palencar\n\nThe Terrorists of Irustan\n\nLouise Marley\n\nAce (trade paperback, 323 pages, $13.95/$19.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: June 1, 1999\n\nThis looks like a breakout book for Marley -- a complex far-future fable of oppression and rebellion. From the author of Receive the Gift and Sing the Warmth. \"Zahra IbSada is a talented medicant on the planet of Irustan. In a nation where women's rights are drastically restricted, her job allows her to see much joy-and pain-in the lives of the women she heals. A wife is brutally beaten. A prostitute suffers at the hands of her employers. And her best friend Kalen struggles to save her daughter from a cruel marriage. She begs Zahra for help. Although Karen's plan goes against her medicant vows, Zahra reluctantly agrees. But this silent act of terrorism will have far-reaching consequences -- for herself, and for all the women of her planet...\" Receive the Gift\n\nLouise Marley\n\nAce paperback\n\nThe third novel from new author Louise Marley, author of Sing the Warmth and Sing the Light, finds the situation grim in the House of Soren. Itinerant Singers have united under the brutal Cho, whose lethal Gift has brought Soren under his control. The Cantor of Soren has been killed, and those who serve Cho do so out of fear. No ones dares to oppose him.. except for Cantrix Sira, the only one strong enough to stop him. But the Conservatory branded her a traitor years ago. Sing The Warmth\n\nLouise Marley\n\nAce paperback\n\nThis is a sequel to Sing The Light, set on a frozen planet.\n\nThe Eleventh Plague\n\nJohn S. Marr and John Baldwin\n\nHarper Collins/Cliff Street Books hard cover\n\nIn Southern California, two children die of a disease believed to be nonexistent in the U.S. Within hours, horses at the legendary Churchill Downs are dying of an unidentifiable virus. The deaths bear uncanny similarities to the Fifth and Sixth Plagues described in the Book of Exodus -- and every month another monstrosity claims its victims, as each one sees the reenactment of a progressively more catastrophic plague. Noted virologist Jack Bryne discovers the events are not only connected, but deliberate acts of bioterrorism. The only problem is, he's the prime suspect. Tomorrow, When the War Began\n\nJohn Marsden\n\nCrown\n\nArt: Yvonne Gilbert\n\nCloudbearer's Shadow (Sword in Exile Trilogy, Book 1)\n\nAnn Marston\n\nHarperPrism (paperback, 330 pages, $5.99 US/$7.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: February, 1999\n\nThe start of a new fantasy trilogy from the Canadian author of The Rune Blade Trilogy. \"Cloudbearer's Shadow\" inaugurates a breathtaking new series centered on Gereth, the youngest and the last of the unfortunate lords of Skai. Called home from exile by his dying father, he finds the Maedun conquest of his homeland all but complete. The rune blade called Bane has been lost forever to dark sorcery, and the Somber Riders rule the island of Celi. The runes lied. The Skai King who was prophesied never came. It is too late for Celi.

Martin\n\nBantam Spectra (hardcover, 762 pages, $25.95 US/$37.95 Can)\n\nPublication date: February 9, 1999\n\nThe sequel to A Game of Thrones continues one of the most critically acclaimed sagas of last year -- and one of the most popular ongoing fantasy sagas in our offices. \"Transporting readers into a forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare, A Clash of Kings is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Set against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors.\"\n\nA Game of Thrones Review by Jim Seidman\n\nGreat Science Fiction Stories: Under Siege\n\nGeorge R.R.

A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Vol. 1)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin\n\nBantam Spectra\n\nPaperback version of one of the most acclaimed fantasy sagas from last year. An original epic that focuses as much on court intrigue and the multi-faceted conflict between vying humans as it does on magic and mystery, the story centers on the last heirs of the old dynasty of the Seven Kingdoms, a teenage boy and girl, who live in exile with dreams of reclaiming their throne from \"The Usurper\" -- Robert Baratheon, the man who overthrew the cruel king.\n\nDuane O. Myers\n\nThe House of Bairn (The Magelord Trilogy, Book 3)\n\nThomas K. Martin\n\nAce (paperback, 292 pages, $5.99 US/$7.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: May 1, 1999\n\nThe final volume in the Magelord trilogy follows Magelord: The Awakening and Magelord: The Time of Madness. \"An ancient legend of fear still holds the land in its grip. While those with the Power flee King Gavin's wrath, Bjorn, a simple hunter, discovers that he has this same outlawed ability. Pursued by the king's legions, Bjorn conjures an escape--and is transported into the past. Now he must marshal his ancestors in order to bring those held down by fear to a new future. For the pain and anguish of his memories must never be repeated...\" Magelord: The Awakening\n\nThomas K. Martin\n\nAce paperback\n\nThe first book in a new trilogy from the author of A Call to Arms. The old tales of the Time of Madness are still told, when the godlike MageLords fought great battles that nearly destroyed the world. The MageLords were sorcerers who looked upon ordinary men with contempt and who are still feared and hated. But now is the time for a new tale.

Got your dinner reservation yet? I hear all the good restaurants are booked. Hour of Judgment (An Inquisitor Andrej Kosciusko novel)\n\nSusan R. Matthews\n\nAvon/Eos (paperback, 260 pages, $5.99/$7.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: December 9, 1998\n\nI think Avon/Eos is really getting the hang of these design-centered covers. It's been almost a year since the imprint was launched with a strict policy that favored design over painted art, with some clear successes (Cosm, An Exchange of Hostages, The Crimson Sky) and some notable failures (White Light, Dry Water). Lately there's been a lot more of the former however, and if it continues -- as it clearly does this month -- I wouldn't be at all surprised to see more publishers follow suit. Hour of Judgment is the third novel in the adventures of Inquisitor Andrej Kosciusko, a man of honor and principle in a very dark universe -- a man who excels at his chosen profession: torture. The sequel to An Exchange of Hostages and Prisoner of Conscience. Prisoner of Conscience\n\nSusan R. Matthews\n\nAvon/EOS paperback\n\nThe author of the powerful debut novel An Exchange of Hostages returns to the world of the Bench Federation, where Andrej Koscuisko serves as a reluctant Inquisitor, rooting out those who threaten the ruling order with quiet efficiency. Andrej has been posted to the penal facility at Port Rudistal, where hundreds await interrogation... and where he must risk both his career and his life to expose the truth behind the black walls of Domitt Prison. Special introductory price. An Exchange of Hostages\n\nSusan R. Matthews\n\nAvon Books paperback\n\nAgainst his will the surgeon Andrej Koscuisko has come to a military center in deep space to train as \"Ship's Inquisitor\" -- a training that often violates many of his deepest convictions. And ultimately he may be forced to sacrifice all he holds dear.\n\nPeter Peebles\n\nNocturne for a Dangerous Man\n\nMarc Matz\n\nTor (hardcover, 495 pages, $25.95/$36.95 Can)\n\nPublication date: July 7, 1999\n\nThis debut novel is a near-future thriller staring Gavilan Robie -- former counter-terrorist operator, martial arts expert, connoisseur, and musician. But when he's approached by the head of a huge engineering consortium to go head-to-head with an eco-terrorist group and recover her kidnapped lover, even Robie may have more than he bargained for. \"Gavilan Robie was part Cheyenne, part Basque, part any number of distinguished ancestors, many of whom spoke in his thoughts when he was feeling particularly down. He was puzzled when a major corporation asked him to recover the kidnapped Siv Matthiessen. It wasn't really his kind of thing -- since retiring from the Action Rescue Committee, he specialized in recovering stolen art. But he agreed to do it when, among other persuasions, the most powerful computer in the world endorsed him.\"\n\nStephen Bradbury\n\nPerseus Spur\n\nJulian May\n\nDel Rey (paperback, 329 pages, $6.99/$9.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: July 1, 1999\n\nAn adventure of the Rampart Worlds, and a brand new SF novel from the author of The Many-Colored Land and The Golden Torc. \"When rebellious Asahel Frost was expelled from the Interstellar Commerce Secretariat on trumped-up charges, he lost it all: wife, citizenship, fortune, self-respect. Exiled to a beautiful but remote planet in the Perseus Spur, Frost became Helmut Icicle, a man without a past or a future. But someone remembered Asahel Frost -- remembered him enough to send an assassin to kill him. And in so doing, brought him back to life. Now, determined to track down the would-be assassin, Helmut finds himself caught in a conspiracy as convoluted as it is deadly. His sister, Eve, has mysteriously vanished. His estranged father wants him to find her with the assistance of the lovely Matilde Gregoire, who happens to hate his guts. As Helmut follows the tangled strands of deceit, greed, and violence back to their common source, he begins to wonder if he is the hunter or the hunted...\" Magnificat (The Galactic Milieu, Vol. 3)\n\nJulian May\n\nDel Rey\n\nBook three of the trilogy, following Jack the Bodiless and Diamond Mask. \"Humanity is well on its way to achieving unity with the inhabitants of other planets within the Galactic Milieu. But Marc Remillard and his followers are determined to elevate mankind above all other races by insidious means. Only Marc's brother, Jack the Bodiless, and the girl called Diamond Mask can stop him.\"\n\nSF Site Review Pegasus\n\nMarianna Mayer, K. Y. Craft\n\nMorrow hard cover\n\nFrom the author of Baba Yaga and Vasilisa the Brave and Turandot comes a beautifully illustrated version of the tale of Bellerophon, the son of the king of Corinth, who must secure the help of the legendary winged horse Pegasus to battle the monstrous Chimera."
