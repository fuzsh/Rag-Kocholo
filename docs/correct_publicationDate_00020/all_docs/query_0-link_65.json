        "text": "YOUR RECOMMENDED SF READING LIST\n\nFollowing are books that you out there in Webland have suggested. Comments are mostly yours, not mine. Some of these I have read and can heartily second; others I have not read. You be the judge.\n\n(Anonymous) – Beowulf\n\nAdams, Douglas — (Says a reader: “All his books are hysterical!”)\n\nAnderson, Poul – Boat of a Million Years\n\nAsimov, Isaac – The Stars, Like Dust and The End of Eternity\n\nBanks, Iain M. – Consider Phlebas, The Player of Games, Use of Weapons, and Excession (all space operas about the Culture, a fictitious future civilization); also Against a Dark Background, an SF thriller\n\nBarnes, Steven – Firedance (almost a religious experience)\n\nBaxter, Stephen – The Time Ships\n\nBear, Greg – Blood Music and Moving Mars\n\nBenford, Gregory – Great Sky River (Part of the Galactic Center series: human tribe in the heart of a monstrous machine civilization.)\n\nBishop, Anne — Daughter of the Blood (First of a trilogy. Says a reader: “One of the best books I have ever read.”)\n\nBishop, Michael – Nebula winning No Enemy But Time, and more recently his Brittle Innings (The Frankenstein monster turns up in the 1940s, and plays semi-pro baseball during WWII, the story told with a realist, Southern grit. An amazing feat.)\n\nBlish, James – Cities in Flight collection (good one: a classic in the field!)\n\nBrackett, Leigh – The Long Tomorrow\n\nBradbury, Ray – Fahrenheit 451, another classic\n\nBradley, Marion Zimmer – The Hunters of the Red Moon (Earth human plucked off his sailboat by intergalactic slavers.)\n\nBriggs, Patricia – Masques, When Demons Walk, and Steal the Dragon (three loosely-connected fantasy novels that have strong female leads and excellent dialogue)\n\nBrin, David – Startide Rising (Well thought-out universe and very good sociology)\n\nBrooks, Terry – the Shannara series\n\nBrown, Fredric – collected works, esp. the short stories\n\nBrunner, John – Stand on Zanzibar, The Sheep Look Up, and The Crucible of Time. Also, from another reader, The Shockwave Rider.\n\nBurke, James Lee – In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead (“Not SF at all, other than the ghostly aspect, but…incredible characterizations…”)\n\nBurroughs, Edgar Rice – John Carter, Warlord of Mars series; the Venus or the Pellucidar books, and the Tarzan books\n\nButler, Octavia – Wild Seed and Mind of My Mind (unscientific but terrific writing)\n\nCarver, Jeffrey A. – The Rapture Effect (I was asked by a reader to add this.)\n\nChalker, Jack – Midnight at the Well of Souls\n\nClarke, Arthur C. – Rendezvous with Rama, Rama II, The Garden of Rama, Rama Revealed [JC note: the first book garnered almost univeral praise. The sequels received far more mixed reviews.]\n\nCrichton, Michael – Sphere (“Scares, shock, and surprises all the way,” says a reader.) [JC note: Just goes to show how tastes differ. I found the book manipulative, incoherent, and badly crafted. Maybe I missed something?] From another reader: Jurassic Park\n\nCook, Paul – The Fortress on the Sun\n\nDeLint, Charles – Spiritwalk, Moonheart, and The Little Country (urban fantasies)\n\nDick, Philip K. – Counter-Clock World, Valis, Eye in the Sky, Clans of the Alphane Moon\n\nEddings, David – Belgarion series and the Mallorean series as well as the additional books of Belgarath and Polgara\n\nEllison, Harlan – The Essential Ellison, or just about any other collection of his short stories\n\nFeist, Raymond E. – Magician; also, from another reader, all of the books of the Riftwar Saga, and of the Serpentwar Saga\n\nForward, Eve – Villains By Necessity (“Very funny and somewhat light-hearted as well as gripping,” says a reader.)\n\nForward, Robert L. – Dragon’s Egg and its sequel Starquake, as well as Camelot 30K and Time Masters\n\nFoster, Alan Dean – Flinx series (The Tar-Aiym Krang, Orphan Star, The End of the Matter, Flinx in Flux)\n\nFreidman, C.

They are far more obviously theological…than the Narnia series.”)\n\nLogan, Charles – Shipwreck (“…quite stunning, yet it does not seem to be well known in the science-fiction world, in spite of winning a competition in 1975.”)\n\nMartin, George R.R. – A Game of Thrones (“A beautiful and gripping story from a god-gifted writer,” says one reader.
