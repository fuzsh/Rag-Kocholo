It was a therefore a labour of love twice over, one I would happily repeat for Garrick or work with another author. I won‚Äôt deny seeing the ‚ÄòE‚Äô rating for fruity language gives me a bit of a thrill! Sorry, mother‚Ä¶ Please give ‚ÄòStorm Damage‚Äô a listen, especially if you‚Äôre a #sciencefiction and/or an #audiobook fan.
