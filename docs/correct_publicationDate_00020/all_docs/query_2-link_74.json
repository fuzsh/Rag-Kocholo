        "text": "About the Across A Field of Starlight Graphic Novel\n\nWhen they were kids, Fassen's fighter spaceship crash-landed on a planet that Lu's survey force was exploring. It was a forbidden meeting between a kid from a war-focused resistance movement and a kid whose community and planet are dedicated to peace and secrecy. Lu and Fassen are from different worlds and separate solar systems. But their friendship keeps them in each other's orbit as they grow up. As the galactic empire begins an attack against Fassen's people-and discovers Lu's in the process-the two of them have the chance to reunite at last. They finally are able to be together, but at what cost? Available in softcover and hardcover editions."
