        "text": "At the end of 2023, I decided that my New Year’s resolution for the forthcoming year would again be a book-related one – one that not only did I stand a chance of achieving, but one that I might enjoy. Having promised myself that I would read more Young Adult titles in 2023, this year I thought it prudent to make a dent in my TBR pile and so decided that each month I would read at least one title that was already sitting there, in addition to those arriving to be reviewed.\n\nAfter only managing one read in both January and February, March brought an unexpected visit to the dentist for treatment and, feeling sorry for myself and in need of a treat, I picked up The Skylarks’ War by Hilary McKay. Having been blown away by that gorgeous story, when I spotted her latest title on Net Galley and noticed that it was illustrated by Keith Robinson, whose covers for the Aveline Jones series are brilliant, I just had to request it. When the approval came through, I bumped it straight to the top of the pile and read it in a day. Written with enormous empathy, with a delightful protagonist and a sprinkling of magic, this is a gorgeous middle grade that I’m sure will be hugely popular with its audience as they are transported to the beautiful city of Venice.\n\nBefore then, we meet Rosa Mundi, who orphaned at the tender age of four has spent the last eight years in the charge of her cold and uncaring aunt and uncle. Thinking back to when she was first placed in their care, Rosa reflects on the curious, magical arrival of cat Balthazar in her life whose presence has since been a source of comfort to her and the many changes that have taken place in her home since her guardians’ arrival.\n\nRoutinely locked into her bedroom at night, Rosa soon learns to escape through her window into the garden to spend time with her furry friend and to seek solace in her book of fairy tales to provide some welcome relief from her miserable existence as her aunt and uncle do their best to ignore her as much as possible whilst running their business.\n\nWhen they plan a work trip to Venice, they are forced to take Rosa with them and very soon their niece finds herself abandoned in the city. With no family or friends to turn to, how will Rosa manage in her new surroundings? And will the magic that brought her Balthazar bring her a way through?\n\nOrphans so often have a grim time in children’s books and Rosa is no exception. While she hasn’t been kicked out on the street by the relatives who arrive to care for her, she is starved of love by them – love that she so desperately needs and has an abundance of to give, as she demonstrates in her relationship with Balthazar and again later on in the story, making her a character that young readers will really feel for. So very ordinary in almost all respects, this empathy for her that the author’s writing promotes combined with the very realness of her sweeps you up and encourages you to keep turning the pages in the hopes that each new one will bring her the chance of happiness that she so very much deserves.\n\nI’m sure I won’t be the only one reminded of the Roald Dahl classic Matilda reading this. There are definite parallels with that read, with Rosa’s aunt and uncle taking the roles of Mr and Mrs Wormwood, but this does not contain the slapstick humour of that title. Instead, this is a much more mature story – one that will appeal to a slightly older and more confident readership, who will revel in its gorgeous narrative. I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it to those in Year 4 upwards, especially to those in search of a shorter than usual middle grade – this comprises 240 pages, including those with Keith Robinson’s illustrations which complement the text wonderfully well.\n\nAs always, my enormous thanks go to publisher Macmillan Children’s Books and to Net Galley for my advance virtual read. Rosa by Starlight publishes 8th August."
