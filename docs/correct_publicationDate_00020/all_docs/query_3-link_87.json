        "text": "Artist Poetry Books Are Now Available!\n\nFacebook Live Event, Wednesday, September 1 at 12pm\n\nANDY CALDERON\n\n​\n\nAndrew Isadore Calderon, aka The Poet AIC, is a creative spirit and has always listened to various works of poetry. Growing up on the West Side of Buffalo, Calderon gained an interest in rap and hip-hop music through family members. However, years later, Andrew’s interest in art really came to the light when he achieved the fine arts award at Bennett High School for taking all the art and music classes that the school had to offer, graduating from Bennett with a local diploma in June 1993.\n\nCalderon attributes his success to the members of the creative and poetic community, especially his writing mentors, Robin F. Brox and Elizabeth Mariani. Calderon currently attends Starlight Studio and Art Gallery, an art day program at where he creates poetry and other, various visual art.\n\nPrior to the concerns of the last year and a half, The Poet AIC performed any chance he got including at Starlight Studio art openings and Spot Coffee’s open mic night. Calderon contributed to two anthologies, In Starlight’s Genesis: An Anthology and (Dis)Integration. Livin’ God’s Crazy Dream is Calderon’s first solo poetry book. He currently resides in North Buffalo and continues to write poetry.\n\n​\n\nPraise for \"Livin' God's Crazy Dream\":\n\nAndrew Calderon’s words fill the page with the intensity of a rap anthem. His rhymes are both playful and finely crafted. They leave the reader smiling in wonderful amazement at both their creative flair and their depth. Like a pop song that has become a timeless classic, Calderon’s poems evoke nostalgia tempered by the gritty reality of the past.\n\n- Michael Rembis, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of History Director, Center for Disability Studies and Co-editor of (Dis)Integration\n\nThe words in Calderon’s poems seem to punch off the page in a tense rapping style with a balanced mixture of power and poignancy. They are often angry but it is not the kind of anger that leaves the recipient cringing or feeling guilty. In A Teeny Tiny Bit about Myself, the litany of hurts and insults: “I was the slow one at school A retard An idiot A dim wit – A fool” ends with a positive burst of certainty and self-esteem: “Nowhere near Where I am Today.” This is a writer with astute observations about life around him and a solid grasp of emotive language. He takes his experiences, “One heart ache at a time,” and uses them to recognize his own worth “From The First To The Very Last Event – Reciting Out Loud The Poetic Words I Meant.”\n\n-Jennifer Gold is an author of children’s picture books Top Leaf and Yes! I Knew the Queen and a radio and magazine journalist.\n\nSo That Is Where I AmAndy Calderon\n\nSo That Is Where I Am\n\nNot Even Awake As The Wheels Turn\n\nGot Up Early The Fyre Started To Burn\n\nGot On The Bus To Go To The Place I Heal\n\nGot On The Bus To Go To The Place Where Art Is Real\n\nFrom The First To The Very Last Event\n\nReciting Out Loud The Poetic Words I Meant\n\nSo That Is Where I Am\n\nAnxiety And Nerves Become Adrenalin\n\nNow I’m Ready To Jam\n\nThere Are Big Thangs Comin’ And Comin’ Fast\n\nThrough It All Got To Be Sure I Can Last\n\nThe Time Has Come To Tell The Story\n\nA Production, A Book, Good Times And Good People\n\nConstantly Making History\n\nThrough It All Just Livin’ God’s Crazy Dream\n\nHappy On The Way Home After It All Happens\n\nThen I Will Be Ready To Scream\n\nUnexpected What All Were Unexpecting\n\nPerfected Personal Performances\n\nAll Part Of A Production That The Genius Girl Was Perfecting\n\nBetween People The Name Of The Production\n\nThat The Genius Girl Was Erecting\n\nNot Even Awake As The Wheels Turn\n\nGot Up Early The Fyre Started To Burn\n\nGot On The Bus To Go To The Place I Heal\n\nGot On The Bus To Go To The Place Where Art Is Real\n\nFrom The First To The Very Last Event\n\nReciting Out Loud The Poetic Words That I Meant\n\nHoly WednesdayAndy Calderon\n\nHoly Wednesday\n\nOn Wednesday morning took the bus to see GOD\n\nGot the holy ashes put on my forehead\n\n“We all came from the dust\n\nTo the dust we all shall return”\n\nAre the words that The Almighty GOD said\n\nFor the forgiveness of all my sins\n\nIs the reason why The Almighty GOD bled\n\nThe almighty GOD died on the Holy Cross\n\nThree days later The Almighty GOD rose from the dead\n\nFalling on Tha 4th DayAndy Calderon\n\nFalling On Tha 4TH Day\n\nAsh Wednesday\n\nIn the afternoon\n\nIce on the Ground\n\nIs when I went down\n\nI fell\n\nAnd my bills went flyin’\n\nI was not tryin’\n\nNor denyin’\n\nNor was I cryin’\n\nI felt like a\n\nBig, Injured, Grizzly Bear\n\nWith Shaggy, Brown Hair\n\nThat fell\n\nMad as Hell\n\nGot up holding its arm\n\nGrowling and snarling\n\nAfter Tha Turbulent A.M.Andy Calderon\n\nAfter Tha Turbulent A.M\n\nCalmin’ down after a turbulent morning\n\nNothin’ was boring\n\nTouring many creative laboratories\n\nClay and jewelry makin’\n\nTyphoon, thunderstorm and earthquakin’\n\nIn 2005 art hit me like a lightning bolt\n\nGave me a burst, a shock and a sudden jolt\n\nStarted to burn like a ragin’ fire\n\nStarted to flow through me like a live wire\n\nThrough my art\n\nMy craft\n\nA passion\n\nI thank the Lord that this is lastin’\n\nTakin’ a big swig\n\nLike a Poland Spring\n\nCold chillin’ in the library\n\nDoin’ my thing\n\nBut at the end of the day\n\nNot makin’ a fuss\n\nOn my way home\n\non the 2:30 bus\n\nDeep ThoughtsAndy Calderon\n\nDeep Thoughts\n\nPink and purple polka dots at Easter\n\nSpringtime with Edmarie\n\nNice weather makes me happy\n\nPeace and tranquility\n\nA nighttime sky in summer\n\nMideastern graffiti\n\nA man with Bob Marley looks\n\nA mass for all that have passed away\n\nTo the next life like Evelyn\n\nStill, I see the next day\n\nNo product\n\nKELLY EVANS\n\n​\n\nAnother Light Brightens Buffalo: First solo book of poems & drawings published by poet/artist, Kelly Evans.\n\nStarlight Studio & Art Gallery, 340 Delaware Ave., Buffalo, NY, is pleased to announce the release of Another Light by Kelly Evans. Writing mentor, Michael Rembis, UB Assoc. Prof., says Evans’ work “provokes both thought and emotion. Its beauty and complexity make the reader demand more, with each new reading calling forth deeper meaning.” The black and white renditions of nineteen original drawings by Evans counter-balance and open another window for her light to shine out. Kyle Butler, Visual Artist, Curator and Adj. Prof. of Fine Arts remarks that “Evans work tends toward two moods…a sort of performed cool…(or) tenderness and vulnerability.”\n\nPrevious work by Kelly Evans her involvement in Between People, the Affirmative Project, a freestyle play, directed by Galia Binder at the Jim Bush Studio on Buffalo’s Westside. Three of Evans poems were accepted for (Dis)Integration, a juried 2017 anthology of writing and artwork by community members with special needs. Evans’ poetry and artwork are included in Writer’s Block (fall 2015), Daemon College literary magazine. She has had artwork in numerous shows at Starlight Studio and Art Gallery 2015-present. Evans collaborated on artwork for Co-Artifact 2014 and 2018 with artists, Cathy Shuman Miller and Pam Glick, respectively.\n\nEvans currently spends most of her time creating art and poetry and enjoys being an artist/poet at Starlight Studio and Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY. Evans, who hopes to get back to regularly read her poetry for art openings, etc. at the gallery, resides in the Buffalo area.\n\n-17 original poems & 19 original drawings by Kelly Evans\n\n-Printed locally with Keller Bros & Miller Inc\n\n-Funding from Erie County and through Learning Disabilities Assoc. of WNY\n\n​\n\nPraise for \"Another Light\":\n\n​\n\nAnother Light is aptly titled. It is a collection of sparks, insights into the self, underbellies revealed, vulnerable, a fast paced glimpse at the soul. The poet illuminates dark corners then whisks the light away and lets the shadows settle in—loss, love, sadness, joy, celebration, and realization. They speak truths.\n\n-Lorna Czarnota MacDonald, author of Breadline Blue; Legends, Lore and Secrets of WNY; and Dancing at the Crossroads\n\nKelly Evans' drawings tend toward two moods. One is of a sort of performed cool, as in her renditions of musicians like David Bowie and Marc Almond. The figures calmly pose, as cool does, aware but not flaunting. In other drawings, the mood is more of tenderness and vulnerability. The figures seem to dwell in thought, their body language more slack, eyes more alert. Even in non-figurative work, this combination of matter-of-fact cool and pleading openness seems present in the mix of stern lines, thinly scratched-in detail, and sparse or absent backgrounds. In their pairing, these two moods illustrate distant but related mindsets: one of projected confidence and one of reflective reservation.\n\n-Kyle Butler, Visual Artist, Art Curator, and Assistant Professor of Fine Arts,\n\nVilla Maria College\n\nKelly Evan’s poems beg the reader to not make assumptions, to observe, to go deeper and realize that we are all capable of being loved, being in love and of being hurt. These poignant poems are full of surprises. In Blue Jay she asks bird to sing a song and show her the way. In I Was Wrong she berates herself and feels ridiculous as so many women do for trusting someone she loved. In Love is Pitter Patter Gone she plays delightfully with colors and questions. As well as writing poetry, Evans is an artist of some merit. Her well defined pencil drawings show us a complex woman who is strong, playful, caring and vulnerable. Evans’s poems and her drawings are brave in their awareness of the unpredictability and sometimes cruelty of life, “it’s a confusing, heartless world we live in” she writes in Room Slave. But we can be sure that Evans will never give up. Her words are honest and she has given us poems that we should all read to remind ourselves that we are flawed and that we need to have more compassion for each other.\n\n-Jennifer Gold, author of Yes! I Knew the Queen and Top Leaf\n\nWhether it is the sullen and mysterious tones of “Room Slave” or “Wooden Flies,” or the playful melody of “In the Middle,” Kelly Evans’ work provokes both thought and emotion. Its beauty and complexity make the reader demand more, with each new reading calling forth deeper meaning. Evans’ unique blend of hopefulness and deep introspection demands attention.\n\n- Michael Rembis, Ph.D., Assoc. Professor, Department of History Director, Center for Disability Studies, Univ. of Buffalo, and Co-editor of (Dis)Integration\n\nBlue JayKelly Evans\n\nBlue Jay\n\nUp way in the trees lay a blue jay that I see,\n\nway up high in the deep blue sky.\n\nShe is singing to me that our friendship should never die.\n\nIt is no lie that we all get too shy and\n\nlike to hide our faces in disguise.\n\nShow your face and your bright blue eyes.\n\nBe sure to say hi without despise,\n\nbut with a caring smile we all can share.\n\nSo blue jay, blue jay, deep in the sky\n\nshow me the way, sing me a song that we all can sing along.\n\nThe shades of blue sea carry us away\n\nwhere happiness is eternal.\n\nLet our wings take us away where we may stay.\n\nTake us to a fantasy land where we have the freedom to stand\n\nin a big field of blue flowers\n\nwe’ll stay for many hours.\n\nThe dawn never becomes dark\n\nthe blue days are always bright without some kind of fight.\n\nSo blue jay, blue jay, deep in the sky,\n\nshow me the way, sing me a song that we can all sing along.\n\nWake up in the sight of the blackest night,\n\nit seemed it was just another theme\n\nof a dream in my head.\n\nBut instead soon the moon would be the sight of a new day.\n\nSo one last time blue jay, blue jay, deep in the sky,\n\nshow me the way, sing me a song that we can all sing along.\n\nChangeKelly Evans\n\nChange\n\nChange is never easy,\n\nbut it is a new reframe\n\nto start something new.\n\nChange an ever growing face\n\nfull of grace,\n\na fashion statement always changing.\n\nTechnology always growing\n\nnot knowing what will come next.\n\nWords are silent, never face to face\n\nbut may be ignored.\n\nA change where people have a sustained view\n\nof never stopping,\n\nnever looking to say hello.\n\nHidden words behind the screen\n\nnever see a face with expression.\n\nAggression is advised that\n\nhurtful words can be troubling.\n\nMalcolm PuppyKelly Evans\n\nMalcolm Puppy\n\nMalcolm puppy\n\nsappy\n\nalways happy\n\nto see you,\n\nblack as coal\n\nbut never a toll\n\nfor what he is.\n\nFast as a rabbit,\n\nplayful so never a habit.\n\nReady to hunt\n\nwith a grunt,\n\nCurly\n\nso dark and swirly.\n\nIn the month of May\n\neyes like a new born baby,\n\nsometimes cranky\n\nDo you need a spanky?.\n\nHas a cute little beard\n\nnot so weird.\n\nAlways a lovable friend\n\nevery need to tend\n\nMalcolm puppy\n\nalways full of energy\n\nand a great memory\n\nwill never die!\n\nYou like to tickle\n\nlike a sweet sour pickle\n\nYou remain in my heart.\n\nYoung Eyes, Old SoulKelly Evans\n\nYoung Eyes, Old Soul\n\nKeys to another life,\n\nto another light;\n\nscenes to a world could have been.\n\nOld eyes, young skin.\n\nKeys of an old, soft song.\n\nIf I had a perfect body, perfect mind,\n\nmaybe I could have been born in another time.\n\nCrystal balls, will I learn to grow old as been told?\n\nHow much time do we really have?\n\nToday is new, but yesterday is old.\n\nWhy do the days fly by\n\nbut not enough time to cry?\n\nA betrayal that she’ll never be\n\nforgotten but claimed in time.\n\nThe glorious forest walls\n\nWhere has daddy gone?\n\nHe took a trip to Heaven,\n\nalways looking down under the hazy walls,\n\ninto a twisting maze of a winding forest.\n\nThe vines of time will cover me\n\nand the walls of beauty for eternity.\n\nJust like you daddy, forever young.\n\nBut you are not forgotten\n\nand never lost your spirit,\n\nfor it lies within me.\n\nMaybe in the next life\n\nwe can meet again."
