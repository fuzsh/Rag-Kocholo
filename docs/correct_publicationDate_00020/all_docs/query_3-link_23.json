        "text": "May 10, 2010\n\nI love Christopher Pike. I have been reading his books since I was 11 or 12 and I am almost 30 now. His books are amazing, filled with colorful characters, unique settings and amazing stories. And The Starlight Crystal is no exception.\n\nIt's probably my most favorite Pike book and it's one of his least well-known. The story is not a typical Pike story and the blurb on the back does not do it justice. Nor does the cover.\n\nPaige Christian is an 18 year old girl who has just fallen in love for the first time. The problem is that Paige is leaving for an expedition with her father in about a week. To the passengers of the ship, only a year will have passed as they travel, but on earth, 200 years will have passed and Paige's love, Tem, will be gone. Paige and Tem vow to love each other forever, but how can their love truly last when Tem will be gone so quickly?\n\nThis book is truly a work of art. I cried when I read this book and I felt Paige's pain. If you have ever been desperately in love, then you will understand the feelings conveyed in this story.\n\nThis may be a Young Adult book, but I think anyone would enjoy this novel, so steal from your kids for a few hours or days, and get to meet Christopher Pike through one of his greatest novels.\n\nFebruary 13, 2017\n\nI'm usually such a Christopher Pike fanatic - this year I have an evil plan to read books by him I haven't yet, and re-read books by him I have but never reviewed.\n\nIt's all laid out obsessively so, which is how I usually am with most books. I have to say this first book of the year, though - The Starlight Crystal - it and I didn't have chemistry or sync.\n\nHe writes well, of course, as he always does, but here there was a stroke of melodrama behind some of the dialogue and emotions. He doesn't typically focus on love stories of this nature, so perhaps it's that emo-ish yearning that seeks out, even though nothing he'd write could ever be called straight out \"emo.\"\n\nThis science fiction tale was as complex as anything else he comes with (how CAN he think of these things??), but while his mysteries and thrillers and drama pieces leave me mesmerized in their complexities, this one left me in the dust when the ship set sail.\n\nMy mind just doesn't think this way; sad but true. I followed it awhile but I started getting bored. I could see the cleverness, but I didn't like the result either way. Inconsequential, all is love, time ultimately rules all, creation will end and begin and blah... The character ultimately has to do some pretty crappy stuff too, betrayals of friends and loves, all because of the way it's ultimately supposed to be, some higher realization stuff mantra that looks toward the goal of what will ultimately be rather than what IS now.\n\nLots of people feel the love for this story, so it may not be something you need to write off if you personally want to try Pike's work - personally I recommend his other complex works. He's always been a heavy science-fiction writer, and it's inevitable I'd find something by him that wouldn't work well with me. No biggie, I'll keep reading and re-reading the others.\n\nOh, and by the way, that cheesy \"one liner\" pops up again later - and actually has plot relevancy!\n\n\"I'm Paige.\"\n\nHe was serious, for once. \"Are you the first page, or the last?\"\n\nMarch 30, 2009\n\nI have read this book four times and I still adore it. If you like your sci-fi mixed with Eastern philosophy and epic multi-world, multi-lifetime heroes like in the Matrix trilogy, definitely check this out. Don't be put off by the fact that it's marketed as a cheesy teen horror novel- that couldn't be further from what it is.\n\n____________________________\n\nMy review from my book journal when I was 12 (I was an aspiring book review columnist):\n\n\"Pike's best book, full of wonder, grief, inevitability, and once started, will draw you to it like a magnet until you finish. Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read in my whole life. The philosophy is a bit overwhelming, but true and real.\n\nThe week before Paige Christian is to go into the time capsule/spaceship The Traveler, she meets a boy and falls in love with him. But it can't last, because every day on the Traveler equals one year on Earth! So knowing that when she comes back, he will be dead, Paige leaves. The first months are ok, but full of terrible grief. Then things happen that challenge the laws of time itself...and change the future forever!\"\n\nAugust 28, 2018\n\nTwo threads, both alike in pomposity, in the ashes of LA where we lay our scene, an ancient love, a bunch of aliens, and me, crushing on a boy I loved for two weeks when I was eighteen.\n\nPaige and Tem were together for two weeks, so their relationship outlasted Romeo and Juliet's by a factor of three, although later in the book, they're referenced as being together for one week. Either way, THE ENTIRE BOOK IS A CONTRADICTION. Christopher Pike is riding his Eastern philosophy wave: we are an endless, boundless tide of love and compassion for all souls equally and with no discrimination (or Discrimination is Rule One. It was 1996. Discrimination has separate water fountain connotations. Couldn't the all-knowing sea of love choose a better word?); and Paige is obsessed with one specific soul so much that she commits genocide against two different humanoid species. She says she's no Hitler, she's doing it for the betterment of humanity, but Hitler said that too.\n\nEternal love is great. We all like eternal love. Tem, he's a sexy youth with dreads and he loves Paige and they snuggle on a beach in Hawaii, but two weeks with him, and Paige is ditching her best friend and the rest of humanity in a biodome under a fading sun so that she can live through the re-creation of Earth and murder-suicide Tem and herself in order to toughen up humanity by OBLITERATING IT. To be with Tem. Thus making her one with all creation. But mainly with Tem.\n\nAloshka is an unembodied equality, a collective soul of loving compassion but Paige and Tem are more equal than others. Huh.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJanuary 6, 2019\n\nThis year I am re-reading books from my childhood.\n\nThis book was a wild ride. It's got time dilation! It's got freaking awesome spaceships! It's got incest clones! It's got multiple genocides! It's got the heat death of the universe followed by a second Big Bang! It's got meditations on such topics as genetic memory, determinism, reincarnation, causality, the nature of consciousness, and true soulmate love!\n\nBut does it need all of those things? Heck no! And I still don't understand why Paige needed to clone herself, commit murder-suicide, and blow up the planet in order to complete her weird Hindu soul quest and gain the knowledge that she is one with Creation. Didn't she find that out on page 56?\n\nOctober 3, 2009\n\nIt is two hundred years in the future and 18 year old Paige Christian has been given a chance to join the crew of the Traveler, a special spaceship designed to circle the solar system at near light speed. One day aboard the Traveler is equal to ten years on Earth. It is a time capsule as well as a spaceship whose purpose is to study the changes on earth throughout two centuries, and then return home.\n\nSomething awful happens to the ship and the Earth and the years pass, billions of them, and still Paige Christian lives, and remembers all those she left behind.\n\nOne of Pike's best points is his adeptness at building characters, and making you fall in love with them. Paige's strength and courage, Tem's wit and persistence, the relationship between Paige and her father... all memorable. At times, admittedly, the story might get a bit confusing but in the end, everything falls into place and you'll realize the brilliance behind Pike's plot.\n\nI just love the melancholy that simmers within every page until the very end. Still there is so much hope embedded in this story, along with a very philosophical approach to life. The thought of life living itself on and on again is scary, although fascinating.\n\nThis book is strictly not a \"science fiction\" tale--it's a spiritual journey, told through the medium of science fiction. This is one of the best explanations I've seen of the Buddhist/Hindu goal of spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\"I will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Never is a long time.\"\n\n\"Not for us.\"\n\nPike's \"The Starlight Crystal\" gives the feeling that there's something more out there for us. That our concept of life as we know it becomes even that much more complex and gratifying. But I think that it was Paige's undying love for Tem that really gets to me. She created her whole life,and our entire universe based of that love. She opposed all odds, and had to go on to fullfill a destiny that no one person could ever imagine possible.\n\nBook Details:\n\nTitle The Starlight Crystal\n\nAuthor Christopher Pike\n\nReviewed By Purplycookie\n\nAugust 26, 2016\n\nRemains my favorite Christopher Pike story to date. The concepts are perhaps a little too deep - a blend of science fiction, mysticism and spirituality - to fully be given justice in a YA novel. Nonetheless, the idea of a young woman who travels to the end of the Universe and the end of Time itself and lives through two Creations - I have never read anything that comes close to such a stirring love story. For at the heart of it, the book is a story of love (as all Pike's books are) - and no silly teenage romance, but a love that literally transcends time, space, and existence. The Creation is Love. Pike draws from many traditions and weaves them together beautifully: non-attachment, martyrdom, reincarnation, the God within. This is a thinker's tale, a romantic's tale: and I mean Romanticism in its full scope. This story is the Universe's love letter to itself.\n\nFebruary 19, 2018\n\nChristopher Pike is a King.\n\nI have said this \"ironically\" in the past before, but I have had a crazy year, and returning to these favorites (thank you Megan and Rachel) helped me get through it.\n\nThank you, CP!\n\nJune 8, 2019\n\nI started and finished in one day bc I felt like the author had wanted to write like Anthem or Siddhartha, some kind of religious book that is disguised as science fiction or some kind of space horror. It’s spiritual but also kind of empty and I think it’s bc the story is so broad. There are almost no details that really make this persons life come to life, except maybe the dread of loneliness. I think Pike was on a spiritual bend and was like lemme hammer out a Back to the Future tale where the issue is creating an alien species that will destroy earth and then have the world created again.\n\nI will say that I find it interesting the native race she discovers is blue and reminds me a lot of Avatar which came out after this book. Also some of Daniel Clowes Patience has elements of when the older version must confront the younger version (Looper did this as well)\n\nOverall not really a bad book, but I would feel kind of embarrassed if someone like read it and was like “did you really like this?” And I would be all like... it passed the time.\n\nApril 24, 2012\n\nI had read The Starlight Crystal when I was twelve and my curiosity in Cosmology and Physics was only just budding, it helped to put a more personal spin on the same topics I was reading from Hawking and Greene. This book is perfect for young adults who are tired of the same \"Romantic Fantasy\" or for the nerdy little girl who wants to read about a deeper love than teen vampires. To my younger self this book had a great influence in my personal ideology: We are all microscopic in the eyes of the universe but our choices have the power to shape it. Of course The Starlight Crystal takes this a bit literal but it was a fun, thought provoking and accurate read. I only wish I still had my copy.\n\nDecember 21, 2021\n\nThis is a reread. I read it the first time maybe 20 years ago, and I have definitely forgotten almost everything about it, except that I was very much a fan of Christopher Pike back then.\n\nI still enjoyed it this time around, but I think it hits a bit different now that I understand more of the world we live in and how we are treating our planet and abusing our natural resources. Most of the book is philosophical though, and it was also very interesting to see the way everything played out.\n\nThis is not one of my favorite books from Pike, but I'll read anything he writes.\n\nJanuary 21, 2018\n\nTeen Creeps made me read this! I missed reading this when I was a kid but I know I would have LOVED it. As an adult, it feels a little rushed, especially the romance (it is short AF after all), but I have to give Pike tons of credit for taking on such an ambitious idea and getting it done in like 200 pages. If this was written in 2018 it'd probably be a trilogy with 1000000000000% more internal monologue and hand wringing, so I'll take the short version any day.\n\nAugust 13, 2009\n\nAn old favorite. Makes me cry every time!\n\nMay 20, 2014\n\nI will do this man a disservice or..maybe just not be entirely fair by not copying what I say for all of his other books. So far, I come away with the same gratitude that I was able to purchase his books and read them. I simply love them.\n\nWhat else can I say about Mr. Christopher Pike that hasn't already been said? Each novel that I've read, I've been so enticed by (to say the very least). He creates wonderful characters, a thrilling and creative story while not getting overly complicated with it as well, and definitely has his twists and turns throughout the novel(s).\n\nGrowing up, I wasn't much of a book reader. Fortunately since I've hit my 20s, I've started diving into novels even more so and Christopher Pike is leading the way like he's Michael Jordan back in his prime. I've read Sati, The Starlight Crystal, and The Season of Passage and I plan on purchasing all of his other novels. I have already made it a goal for myself to read all of his novels because I simply love the man and the universe he creates for us.\n\nDon't even get me started on his philosophical/spiritual views as well. He doesn't necessarily stuff it down your throat. Not really ever, but there are beautiful, wonderful, and sometimes haunting meanings behind some of his writings. I would love to see more individuals give this man a legitimate shot. Open up your mind. Dive into his worlds. You will not regret it.\n\nMarch 25, 2019\n\nThis may be the most cracked-out book I have ever read, and that is saying something. It was lent to me by a dear friend, who imprinted on Pike as an impressionable young thing, and I think that's the key here. I'd never read any Pike before this past week, and coming to him for the first time with adult eyes is . . . well, not the way you're supposed to come to him.\n\nThis book didn't read so much as a piece of fiction as an outline for a piece of fiction. There was a lot of terse description of actions that the protagonist had taken or was planning on taking, the absolute antithesis of \"show, don't tell.\" The world-bending love that animates the entire book gets no introduction whatsoever; she just meets the guy and it's insta-love. And the pseudo-Buddhist steps to alleged enlightment have some . . . very interesting consequences. To say the least. Like allegedly justified genocide. And a glancing nod at sibling incest.\n\nStill, it held my attention admirably, even when I didn't know what the fork was going on. I kept hoping for a reveal that would make it all make sense (never happened). And the sci-fi bits are terrifically original, at least from my POV, though admittedly I don't read pulpy SF.\n\nIt's desperately weird. That's not the worst thing a book can be.\n\nFebruary 8, 2013\n\nNo. NO!!!! Paige, you little @#&%!!!! Who do you think you are, offing the entire frickin' human race???? You deserve to be boiled in oil. Murderer!!!!! die die DIE!!!!!\n\nYes, this is a rant. I'm sorry, I just can't help taking Paige's betrayal personally. I mean, really, the girl was responsible for wiping out our ENTIRE race!!!! That's not something to be taken lightly. And she thinks we'll remember her as the worst murderer of all?? well, what else should we call her?? She is what she is. TRAITOR!!!!! AARRGGHHH!!!!\n\nOh and lets not forget her justification. Why does she do all these heinous crimes?? Because she has no choice. To quote the Creation \"There is no free will. There is only the appearance of free will\". Bah!!! To hell with the effing Creation!!!!! They (it?) call themselves love?? Hah!! Yeah, right. Had they even an ounce of love, they would have tried to stop the destruction of one of the more sentient races. Love, my foot.\n\nWhen I try to sum up my feelings about this book of \"Love\", only 1 word comes to mind. Can you guess what it is? Yes, that's right. Hate.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 10, 2012\n\nI don't remember Christopher Pike sucking this bad. In fact, I remember him being a guilty pleasure read as a teenager. I guess it's good to know that my reading tastes have matured so well.\n\nI found this book pretty stupid. In fact, I only finished reading it because it was so short and I was kind of hoping that there would be some grand epiphany at the end and suddenly everything would make sense.\n\nApril 16, 2021\n\nSo this isn't the best book ever written, but it's been one of my favorites since I first read it as a teenager. It is an interesting sci-fi setting around an epic love story, with a little self-discovery in there. I must have read this two dozen times over the years and I fall in love with it all over again every time.\n\nMay 29, 2017\n\n3.5 stars. TeenCreeps podcast brought me here and despite it losing some of my interest towards the last third of the book, this was a conceptually fascinating premise with pretty good writing. Lots of philosophy and depth to the plot, but the characters needed a bit more fleshing out early on in the book.\n\nOctober 28, 2017\n\nI will love this book until the end of Creation and then back to the beginning and then...wait, huh?\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\noverall I think this was good, I did mostly enjoy it and the overall love story, it was cute and at times it did make me emotional, however, can we talk about the incest for a moment?\n\nso in the book we all know we have Tem and Paige, at the beginning, they have a little love affair which leads to a long-distance relationship. during that time, he meets an older version of her and they begin dating which within its own right is still not my problem with this text. Later on, she decides to make clones of both of them and she carries them in her womb, making them THEIR CHILDREN. At the beginning, you think they don't realize that and have no memories of their past life but later it is made so they do or at least one of them does but both do. (to some level at least) And in the book itself, it is blatantly said that at least the daughter Paige's clone feels the same way towards the son that the original does towards her dad. This means more than likely she probably has feelings for her father that are not familial but rather romantic and sexual also she can see all their memories with that Tem, meaning any physical relationship with him is raw and easy to recall for her. leading me back to how disgusting the concept genuinely is when you think of it that she clearly was technically thinking of her father and brother in this romantic way at the least. Though i can say that i don't believe she ever crossed the line, the whole concept that she thought and felt anything like that towards either is just weird. ON ANOTHER NOTE SHE (the mother) ALSO MUST HAVE LOOKED AT HER SON LIKE THAT AND HER HUSBAND, which I do restate how weird that truly is and gross if we are honest.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 15, 2014\n\nThe Starlight Crystal is a very thought-provoking novel, and perhaps - as I went into it blind - one of the strangest books I have ever read.\n\nAlthough it is relatively short, it packs a lot in. Description was sacrificed, but I still adored the tone and style of this book.\n\nEven though the characters were easy to imagine and create a bond with, the insta-love was a little bit of an issue. As most of the book focuses on Paige Christian wanting to get back to Tem, I think the gravity of their love could have been heightened with more development of their relationship before she goes on her journey. With that said however, there are plenty of scenes which allow the reader to feel how deep her bond to Tem is despite their short encounter. Due to this, the urge to see them together is raised as the novel goes on.\n\nDespite Christina's situation, she is an easy character to connect with. Pike's use of time is fascinating, frightening, and brilliant, making the beginning of the book at times depressing with the thought of what she is going through, and what she will go through. However, by the end of the book, there is a shift, and it is realised that this is a more uplifting read. It reminds us what we should appreciate, what we should be thankful for, how we should treat others, and that what counts is what we do with the journey towards our destination.\n\nOverall, I found this is a very philosophical, engaging book with an interesting main character and a fascinating scenario. At times, it feels like it is an an epic, 1000-page book in disguise of a novella. It's certainly one of those books which you think about long after you put it down.\n\nMarch 5, 2013\n\nThis is my favorite book ever, I read it in the late 90's and have read it many many times since then. I have gone through at least 4 copies of the book, 2 that I loaned to friends who fell in love with it also so I gave it to them and one copy I actually wore ragged until I had to buy a new one. There seems to be two types of people who read this book, you either think its weird and no big thing - or you are absolutely stunningly amazed at how well planned and developed and freaking brilliant this \"young adult\" novel is. Seriously, read it.\n\nAugust 19, 2013\n\nI read the crap out of Pike when I was a kid. It was like the graduation from Boxcar Children and Goosebumps = Sweet Valley and Christopher Pike. And now, when I think back on his books, THIS is the one that easily stood the most remembered in my head. I was glued to the concepts of time, space, and free will that this book touched on. And of course it had to have the drama, teenage love story. But still, you couldn't pull me away from Starlight Crystal and a couple years later listening to Savage Garden's To the Moon and Back totally reminded me of this book.\n\nAugust 10, 2013\n\none of my favorite books of all time. I started reading Chrisopher Pike as a young adult and the starlight Crystal transends age. i can read this book over and over and never get tired of it. This book makes you think, spiritually, emotionally and physically. this is a sci-fi book that makes your mind ask the quetions about the universe only philosophy majors dare to ask. I will always love this story and what i took away from it changed my course of thinking forever.\n\nOctober 9, 2022\n\nReally not sure how this story is suppose to be read by teenagers. It contains a real unnecessary confusing plot and eventually ends with incestuous relations. I've read a lot of hard Sci-fi novels that make more sense than this one. Still not a bad read overall and I would recommend it as Pike didn't write a lot of Sci-fi stories.\n\nAlso, this Paige is one evil person doing anything for love. Even so much as extracting DNA with a needle from her loves private parts while he's asleep! Damn!\n\nJanuary 30, 2010\n\nThere was a time when this was my favorite book in the world. I reread it so many times I lost count. It was EPIC! With ALIENS and TIME TRAVEL (SORT OF) and SPACE and DEATH and LOVE and CLONING! I think this is where I learned about relativity. Thanks again Christopher Pike."
