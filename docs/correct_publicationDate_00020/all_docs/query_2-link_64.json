        "text": "In Scotland, 1826, Meggy McKessar comes to live and work at John Lovie’s Aberdeenshire farm. John’s widowed mother is warned Meggy will bring trouble, but she refuses to listen; all she wants is for the rumours about John’s sordid past to be forgotten forever. But when a sudden death casts suspicion on Widow Lovie’s favourite son, the life she has so desperately tried to preserve threatens to fall apart.\n\nClosely based on a sensational true crime, Three Times Buried is a sinister tale of torn loyalties, secrets, superstition and murder.\n\n​Exposing Captain Starlight’s twisted life of crime and deceit.\n\nWho was ‘Captain Starlight’?\n\nWhen a respectable public servant dies suddenly under suspicious circumstances, the authorities are baffled. Who really was the dead man? Was he an Irish nobleman fallen on hard times – or a conman, a forger, a serial impostor, a killer?\n\nAs an investigation peels back the layers of deception, aliases and lies, a bizarre chain of events is revealed, exposing the deceased as a man guilty of a string of audacious crimes spanning decades – crimes including identity theft and murder.\n\nIn The Killer's Game, Jane Smith has pieced together the scattered clues to the dead man's background, uncovering the true story of the life and crimes of the 19th-century enigma once known as Frank Pearson – or Captain Starlight.\n\nThe Killer's Game is a re-release of the popular ​Captain Starlight: The Strange But True Story of a Bushranger, Impostor and Murderer.\n\n‘I love this book! Incredibly well-researched, and beautifully written. This is one I'm going to recommend to my friends.’\n\n– Calif Writer, Amazon.\n\n'What an absolute delight! ... As a teacher of young women for over 30 years, I recommend Carly Mills as a heroic character who will inspire young readers, especially girls like Carly, to be curious and ready for action at a moment’s notice.'\n\nKathi-Ann Hill, English and Japanese teacher\n\nHey, kids! Carly Mills has a site of her own. Visit her here.\n\n‘I little thought we were about to proceed on so disastrous a voyage…’\n\nWhen 276 poor British emigrants sail away from Plymouth on the ship Emigrant in April 1850, seeking a better life in Australia, they know nothing of the ordeal that lies ahead. For four terrible months at sea they endure cramped and squalid conditions, insufferable heat, bitter cold … and a mounting death toll from the dreaded disease that rages through the ship: typhus.\n\nWhen the Emigrant arrives in Moreton Bay, the nightmare continues. For three long months in quarantine at Stradbroke Island, the immigrants’ hopes are raised and dashed, and raised and dashed again.\n\nImpeccably researched and poignantly told, Ship of Death unfurls the true saga of the ill-fated voyage, quarantine and aftermath. For the first time, this stunning book reveals the human stories of some key players in the drama – their backgrounds, their suffering, and their fates – and in doing so, brings to life a remarkable journey common to many of Australia’s early settlers.\n\n​\n\nTheir stories are tales of hardship, resilience, courage and despair."
