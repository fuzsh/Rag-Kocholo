        "text": "Reviews for Ship of Lost Souls: [Pre-Order here]\n\n“Riveting! A stranger-than-fiction tale that memorializes the Valencia among the great lost steamships of history—and one lost in the most jaw-dropping of ways.” —Daniel Stone, national bestselling author of Sinkable: Obsession, The Deep Sea, and The Shipwreck of the Titanic\n\n“A fascinating story of tragedy, terror and drama that has been well researched and passionately told. Hard to put down once you start reading.” —Richard M. Jones, author and historian\n\n“A fascinating and highly engaging account of one of the greatest marine tragedies to strike the west coast of North America. Equally impressive is the fact that the author goes out of his way to highlight the important role that the wind and oceanographic conditions played in the tragedy. Had the vessel’s captain taken into account the ship's drift associated with the strong northward-flowing, wind-driven currents known to prevail off the Pacific coast of the US and Canada in winter, the ship might have successfully entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca during the storm and the tragic loss of so many lives would have been averted.” —Richard Thomson, oceanographer; author of Oceanography of the British Columbia Coast\n\n“Scher details the background, key people, decisions, and circumstances that led to the grounding of SS Valencia and the tragically avoidable loss of life. His book reads like an adventure novel, except that it isn't fiction. Like virtually all marine accidents, the loss of Valencia was avoidable. The weakest link in the chain of events was and continues to be the decisions of honest, hard-working, and well-experienced people. Today's yacht and ship crews need to read this book so they can manage their decisions and successfully avoid disaster.” —CDR. John E. Harrington, USCG (Ret.)\n\n“A completely engrossing saga. I could not put it down! Scher combines insightful historical perspectives along with weaving fascinating information on both the inventions and seafaring conventions of the time. While examining the reasons for this disaster, Scher shows how easy it is after the fact to place blame and second-guess each decision made that leads to tragedies. At turns both fascinating and heartbreaking, Scher’s book is a perfect addition to any sailor’s library.” —Patricia Wood, sailor and author of Lottery (short-listed for the 2008 Orange Broadband Prize for Women’s Fiction in the UK)\n\n“Through meticulous research and exacting detail, Scher builds the story of the SS Valencia and makes it come alive by putting the events and people in historical context. And he doesn’t leave out the human component. He makes you care about both passengers and crew—those who survived and those who didn’t—and reveals both heroes and cowards, leaving it up to the readers to draw their own conclusions.” —Valerie Davisson, author of the Logan McKenna mystery series\n\nReviews for Sailing by Starlight [Order here]\n\nA captivating chronicle of an amazing journey, Sailing By Starlight is recommended for sailors and history buffs alike.\n\nWindCheck Magazine\n\nA fascinating piece of non-fiction about Marvin Creamer’s journey around the world—without the use of instruments—told in beautiful prose that gives so much life to this story. For history buffs, fans of seafaring tales, or those who simply want to read about a truly fantastic journey by an incredibly interesting person, you won’t want to miss out on Sailing by Starlight.\n\nNYT bestselling author Tosca Lee\n\nSailing by Starlight is a superb sea story that harkens back to the days when sailors relied on all their senses rather than on technology to navigate. Marvin Creamer displays throughout the story incredible faith in his abilities and senses as well as resolute perseverance against all odds as he and his crew circumnavigated the world in S/V Globe Star.\n\nCAPT David Jackson, USN (Ret.) Offshore Sailing Instructor, US Naval Academy\n\nI’ve had the pleasure of reading Sailing by Starlight, and I tip my hat to Marv Creamer and the crews of the sailing vessel Globe Star. Sitting here in New Zealand aboard our “giant-sized” ocean-crossing sailboat, Tango, I was thrilled, concerned, and sympathetic while reading this epic adventure. I completely understand Marv’s focus and the self-reliance that enabled his success. This was a wonderful read for anyone with desire to read a real adventure with real people.\n\nCMDR John Harrington, USCG (Ret.)\n\nSailing By Starlight is a book about a saga, a quest, a journey. It is meticulously written, exhaustively researched, and a compelling read. Sailors and non-sailors alike will be fascinated by the story of Marv Creamer and his lifelong goal (obsession) of sailing around the world without instruments. It is truly a remarkable achievement and author Rod Scher has managed make Marv’s story accessible to readers who may not be familiar with nautical terminology and also to those who understand the demands of world cruising. Sailing By Starlight chronicles a remarkable journey and is a captivating read.\n\nPatricia Wood, author of Lottery\n\nA thoroughly researched and well-written book that's as much about problem-solving and strength of character as it is about adventure."
