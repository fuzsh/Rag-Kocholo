        "text": "Hush, Puppy: Women’s Fiction Month Two-Minute Read\n\nMy short-short story Hush, Puppy is a victory lap for anyone who's ever been railroaded into eating in a restaurant they can't afford. Welcome to the resistance! Just published in the anthology Tiny Moments Vol. III from Bronze Bird Books, and an Honorable Mention winner in the Women on Writing Spring 2023 Flash Fiction Contest. * I can’t afford [...]\n\nJune 10th, 2024|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nEyewitness: May 18, 1980\n\nJimmy Buffet didn’t know where he was “gonna go when the volcano blows.” But I knew exactly where I had to go. The volcano exploded thirty miles directly north of my parents’ house. We watched it blow the top clean off a mountain whose perfect, sugar-loaf silhouette had stood sentry over my city for all of my life, and all [...]\n\nMay 18th, 2024|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nWriter Unbundled\n\nIf there’s one thing my writerly soul detests, it’s a buzzword. A fork in the thigh of originality and wordsmithery, every insufferable time. Remember “bundling,” one of early 21st century’s most annoying argots? Whole industries, from telecommunications to healthcare to pet grooming bundled bigger and spiffier packages in hopes of persuading, often forcing, us to buy services we may or [...]\n\nApril 26th, 2024|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nDad Lost and Found\n\nMy dad worked his brand of offbeat magic on my mother at their first meeting, a blind date wherein he greeted her with “Shall I impress Superwoman by playing the buffoon, the sophisticate or the intelligentsia?” She was hooked. He had done all three at once, in the space of a single sentence. And when, a few months later, in [...]\n\nMarch 11th, 2024|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nTen Good Reasons to Recycle Content\n\nWe all know George Santayana’s ominous warning, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” We could call it a kind of unintentional recycling. Then there are of us who remember the past and are called to repeat it, with the greatest of intention and purpose. Across a twenty-year writing career, I’ve written fiction and nonfiction, history [...]\n\nJanuary 30th, 2024|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nWhat She Thinks About When She Thinks About Shoes\n\nWhat She Thinks About When She Thinks About Shoes is an exploration of how my mother’s dementia impacted our relationship, ultimately exemplified by a pair of hauntingly, unforgivably ugly shoes. A Chanticleer International Awards finalist for short prose, it's published in the April 2023 issue of Well Read literary magazine. Excerpt: WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT WHEN SHE THINKS ABOUT SHOES [...]\n\nMay 15th, 2023|The Writer by Starlight|\n\n“The most atrocious crime in Traill County history”\n\nIn this time of Defund the Police vs Blue Lives Matter, it mattered to me to tell the story of a beloved young police offer killed by bootleggers in 1893 North Dakota. Locals called it “the most atrocious crime in Traill County history” and waged a 20-year battle for justice, fighting back ferociously when political and fraternal cronies tried to [...]\n\nApril 18th, 2023|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nFive Things You Need to Know to Become a Great Author\n\nMy 2021 interview with Authority magazine asked, “Based on your experience, what are five thing you need to know to become a great author? Please share a story or example for each.” But one needn’t be a writer to benefit from these five things. While my advice was directed at writers, it can apply to many things from parenting to [...]\n\nNovember 27th, 2022|The Writer by Starlight|\n\nFive Ways to Overcome Writer’s Wait\n\nIn a culture that demands instant-everything, writers live in a parallel universe call Waiting. Our work requires the antithesis of now! now! now! The ability to embrace patience and perseverance will be a make-or-break quality for most writers. Before our omnipresent cell phones, people hoping for important calls Waited by the Phone, annoyingly personified by the love-sick young woman or [...]\n\nJuly 6th, 2022|The Writer by Starlight|"
