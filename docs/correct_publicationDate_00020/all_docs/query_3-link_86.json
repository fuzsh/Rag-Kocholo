        "text": "Saskatchewan author Joy Desjarlais started her career writing children's books, but changed direction when her nephew almost died after being held by Saskatoon police. Her book about Darrell Night and the so-called \"Starlight Tours\" is looking for answers to a continuing mystery.\n\n\"Maybe in writing this book about the events that happened to my nephew, I will make sense of the animosity I feel. And maybe, just maybe a new healing will begin,\" says Desjarlais.\n\nIn January 2000, two Saskatoon police officers drove her nephew out of town and left him in freezing weather in what some are calling a \"Starlight Tour.\"\n\nThe Right to Remain Silent, A Night to Remember is about Darrell Night and the events surrounding his case.\n\n\"Darrell's last name is Night, and it's kind of like, in your face to the police officers, that they'll never forget Darrell Night, and for Darrell it's a night that he'll never forget,\" she says.\n\nDarrell Night survived his ordeal and former police officers Dan Hatchen and Ken Munson were eventually found guilty of unlawful confinement and sentenced to eight months in jail.\n\nDesjarlais followed the case through court, an emotional journey that is filled with tears and outrage.\n\n\"There's still so many unanswered questions, and there's still a lot of hurt and a lot of anger. Nothing's really been resolved as far as I'm concerned,\" she says.\n\nDesjarlais wanted to provide a side of the story the news media couldn't. She wants to describe what it felt like to be an Aboriginal person in that courtroom as all the facts of the case were being recounted. She also wants people to know more about Lawrence Wegner and Rodney Naistus, two other aboriginal men who were found frozen to death in the same area Night was abandoned.\n\nCBC.ca Special Report: Cold Case: the Lawrence Wegner Story (opens a new browser window)\n\n\"I'd like to be a writer that's recognized for writing for those people who can't speak for themselves anymore,\" she says, \"and that's the people that have already passed on.\"\n\nDesjarlais plans to write about other Aboriginal people in Canada who have stories of discrimination in the justice system. She says telling these stories is a way to start healing and, hopefully, forgiving.\n\nThe book was published in December, before the two Saskatoon police officers went to jail. Desjarlais plans to reprint the book to include their appeal and jail sentences later this year."
