MacLeod, Ian R.

[Sauk City, Wisconsin]: Arkham House Publishers, Inc., [1997]. Octavo, cloth. First edition. Collects ten stories. The author's first book. "MacLeod is a self-consciously and deliberately literary author. His prose is crafted with far more care than that of most sf authors, and to the extent that he depicts conceptual Novums or scientific advances, they are most often the background for exploration of character. Along with Robert Silverberg he is perhaps sf's greatest chronicler of inwardness." SFE online. [Reference: Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-696]. A fine copy in a fine dust jacket. (22834). Item #22834
