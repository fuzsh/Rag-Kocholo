(Ideally, I'd like it to work like towel.blinkenlights.nl, where you don't have to log in and the ASCII Movie immediately starts.)\n\nSETTING UP TELNET\n\nHere are the steps I've followed using a fresh Digital Ocean droplet running Ubuntu 16.04.2 x64 after setting up a firewall and opening port 23.\n\ninstall telnetd and xinetd: sudo apt-get install xinetd telnetd\n\ncreate telnet file in /etc/xinetd.d: sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/telnet\n\n# default: on # description: The telnet server serves telnet sessions; it uses # unencrypted username/password pairs for authentication. service telnet { disable = no flags = REUSE socket_type = stream wait = no user = root server = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd log_on_failure += USERID }\n\nRestart xinetd service: sudo service xinetd restart\n\nGETTING THE ASCIIPLAYER WORKING\n\nI've confirmed that this allows telnet access (using a username/password)\n\nI uploaded the asciiplayer folder to /opt/\n\nAccording to the README for asciiplayer, I need to replace the above configuration into /etc/xinetd.d/telnet with the bit below:\n\n# default: on # description: An telnet service playing an ASCII movie service telnet { disable = no socket_type = stream protocol = tcp port = 23 user = root wait = no instances = 10 log_type = FILE /var/log/asciiplayer log_on_success += PID HOST DURATION log_on_failure = HOST server = /usr/bin/python server_args = -u -OO /opt/asciiplayer/ascii_telnet_server.py -f /opt/asciiplayer/sw1.txt --stdout }\n\nAfter doing so, I can no longer telnet into the server. It simply returns:\n\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\nWhat part of the process am I missing? I feel like it's very close. I've done the above process a few times and simply can't get the ascii_telnet_server.py to run upon telnetting. The world needs more ASCII movies over telnet!! Any help would be greatly appreciated..."
