You need it only when a remote user is accessing its service. The Extended Internet Services Daemon (xinetd) manages Internet servers, invoking them only when your system receives a request for their services. xinetd checks continuously for any requests by remote users for a particular Internet service; when it receives a request, it then starts the appropriate server daemon."
