I've linked it to this xinetd file\n\nservice myservice { instances = 1 port = 887 socket_type = stream type = UNLISTED wait = no user = nobody server = /usr/local/bin/myscript.py only_from = 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.2 disable = no max_load = 5.0 nice = 5 per_source = 1 }\n\nThis works fine in as much as when a client connects it starts spewing out text on their console. The problem is when the client disconnects, the process launched stays open, blocking the port. There is only one client allowed (instances = 1) but this can occur when the client reboots while connected.\n\nPreviously I thought this was because the python script was ignoring kill signals (which it was) but with this fixed, the same behaviour is observed. To clarify, kill -1 etc is now happily observed by the python script.\n\nI'm assuming this is a xinetd issue and fairly simple to fix ?"
