        "text": "Configuring the UNIX Host\n\nBefore you can use the RCP tool from a Windows-based computer, you must turn on the RCP service and update the security files to allow the Windows-based computer to connect to your computer over this service.\n\nTo turn on the RCP service by using inetd:\n\nLog on to the computer as root.\n\nEdit the file /etc/Inetd.conf.\n\nUncomment the lines that start with shell and that start with exec.\n\nSave the file.\n\nSend the Host User Profile (HUP) signal to inetd by using kill or by using pkill. Use ps to determine the process ID.\n\nRun inetd again.\n\nTo turn on the RCP service by using xinetd:\n\nLog on to the computer as root.\n\nEdit the file /etc/Xinetd.d/rsh.\n\nChange the line disable to no.\n\nSave the file.\n\nSend the HUP signal to xinetd by using kill or by using pkill. Use ps to determine the process ID.\n\nRun xinetd again.\n\nYou must now set the security permissions to allow the Windows host to connect to your computer:\n\nEdit the file /etc/Hosts.equiv.\n\nAdd a line that contains the name of your Windows host.\n\nAdd a second line that contains the name of your Windows host and the name of a user who can access the directory that you want to transfer. Separate the two elements with a tab character.\n\nSave the file.\n\nNOTE: To transfer files from some UNIX computers, you must log on to the Windows-based computer as the user that you set in the file Hosts.equiv.\n\nTransfer a Single File\n\nTo transfer a single file, you must supply the hostname, the username, the path of the source file, and the path of the destination file that you want the file copied to. For example, to copy the file Index.html from the path /usr/local/htdocs on the computer unixhost as the user webuser you must use:\n\nrcp unixhost.webuser:/usr/local/htdocs/index.html index.html"
