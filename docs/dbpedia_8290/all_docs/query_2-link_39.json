        "text": "Xinetd\n\nXinetd is an open-source daemon that manages the Internet connections on many modern Unix and Unix-like servers. It offers improved security over the traditional inetd daemon, and has replaced inetd in most modern versions of Linux, BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution), and Mac OS X. Xinetd performs a similar function to its predecessor. It listens for incoming network traffic and launches the appropriate service, such as FTP (file transfer protocol), HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), or UDP (user datagram protocol), to handle the traffic."
