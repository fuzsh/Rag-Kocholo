It brings up a message box that says something along the lines of\"(locked) Internet super-server\" Then switches back to disabled. I installed the same version of opensuse 11.2 64bit on my laptop, and everything is enabled by default in the yast2 - Network Service Configuration. So not sure why I can’t enable them on my desktop, I even logged onto root, started KDE and still can’t enable them. Any help?\n\nAlso on a side note, being plugged into the lan on my acer aspire 5532 causes webpages to load pretty slow. Takes about 10 seconds to load a simple page. But using the wifi its almost instant loading a webpage. I’m using firefox 3.5. And when i goto www.speedtest.net the lan still gets the 5mb/s, so its getting the full speed of my network, just webpages take 10-15 seconds to load, when on wifi its almost instant.\n\nThanks for the response!!! When I get home, I’ll try that on my desktop. Also any clue why on my laptop using lan I get the same DL speed as i do on wifi, but using lan webpages take about 10 seconds longer before they even pop the webpage into firefox. I know this is the wrong section for the question, I should probably repost it in the networking section.\n\nAgain, thanks so much for your information!!\n\nOn 2012-10-30 04:46, lathika wrote:\n\n>\n\n> Hi\n\n> i have installed opensuse 11.3 in my server.every morning it’s\n\n> network is going down. when i am restart it or it’s working. can you\n\n> help me to fix this problem.\n\nI’d rather not. openSUSE 11.3 is obsolete and out of maintenance; you should instead install 12.1 or\n\n12.2 (11.4 is a possibility but it is going out in a month or so).\n\nOn the other hand, you should start a new thread in the networking subforum.\n\n–\n\nCheers / Saludos,\n\nCarlos E.
