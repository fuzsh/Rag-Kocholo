On a destination server, the disk space requirement varies based upon the operating system:\n\nv\n\nWindows-based Systems – A minimum of 512 Mb of RAM is required on a Windows system in order to accommodate all aspects of the Windows version (1 Gb is recommended on Windows systems running SQL Server or Exchange Server).\n\nn\n\nNetwork Connectivity – Before installing NVR, ascertain the TCP/IP connectivity and Name Resolution between potential source and destination host systems. NVR can transmit data over all types of networks including the following:\n\nn\n\nOperating System-specific Prerequisites – Some operating systems require that you perform various prerequisite procedures before installing NVR. Where applicable, these procedures are covered in the operating system-specific installation instructions offered in the sections that follow.\n\nn\n\nGNU Compiler Collection (gcc) – The gcc is a compiler that allows for support of programming languages, that various applications (including NVR) require for use. To verify if this component is installed, perform the following:\n\nc.\n\nIf a result of “gcc-<version numbers>” is revealed, the component is installed. Otherwise, it must be obtained and installed. See the relevant Linux operating system documentation for instructions on obtaining and installing this component.\n\nn\n\nGNU Binary Utilities (binutils) – A collection of binary utilities used with the GNU interface. To verify if this component is installed, perform the following:\n\nc.\n\nIf a result of “binutils-<version numbers>” is revealed, the component is installed. Otherwise, it must be obtained and installed. See the relevant Linux operating system documentation for instructions on obtaining and installing this component.\n\nn\n\nLinux “make” Utility – The make utility is a software engineering tool for managing and maintaining computer programs. To verify if this component is installed, perform the following steps:\n\nc.\n\nIf a result of “make-<version numbers>” is revealed, the component is installed. Otherwise, it must be obtained and installed. See the relevant Linux operating system documentation for instructions on obtaining and installing this component.\n\nn\n\nxinetd – The internet services daemon for various Linux distributions is xinetd. This component might not be included in a default installation. NVR requires this component to be installed and running. We recommend that xinetd be configured to start at boot time. To verify that xinetd is installed, perform the following steps:\n\nn\n\nkernel-source – When the NVR “.rpm” is installed, it attempts to find the location of the kernel-source and write this information to a file (“/etc/sysconfig/nvr”). When NVR is started, it determines if a kernel module for the currently running kernel exists, and if not, it will create one using a predefined script (“/usr/netvault/replicator/lib/build/modbuild”).\n\nn\n\nkernel-devel (RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, Installations, ONLY) – NVR requires the kernel headers for the running kernel to be available. Customers running RHEL4 should install the kernel-devel RPM which includes those headers.\n\nn\n\nGNU Compiler Collection (gcc) – The gcc is a compiler that allows for support of programming languages, that various applications (including NVR) require for use. To verify if this component is installed, perform the following:\n\nc.\n\nIf a result of “gcc-<version numbers>” is revealed, the component is installed. Otherwise, it must be obtained and installed. See the relevant Linux operating system documentation for instructions on obtaining and installing this component.\n\nn\n\nGNU Binary Utilities (binutils) – A collection of binary utilities used with the GNU interface. To verify if this component is installed, perform the following:\n\nc.\n\nIf a result of “binutils-<version numbers>” is revealed, the component is installed. Otherwise, it must be obtained and installed.
