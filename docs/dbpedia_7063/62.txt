Neil Simon’s I Ought to Be in Pictures is a moving family drama, peppered with the author’s patented gag lines and notable for sock performances by Dinah Manoff and Walter Matthau.

Nimbly opened-out from the 1980 stage version by helmer Herbert Ross, film concerns a 19-year-old, spunky Brooklyn girl Libby (Dinah Manoff reprising her stage role), who hitchhikes to Los Angeles to break into films as an actress but more importantly see her dad who left her, a brother and mom for good 16 years earlier.

Dad is Herb Tucker (Walter Matthau), a once-successful feature and TV scripter now given over to gambling and drinking. Tucker’s loyal g.f. Steffie (Ann-Margret) is supportive but has her own children to take care of.

Key factor in making this work is apt casting, with Manoff outstanding in avoiding direct sentimentality in the showy central role. For his part, Matthau makes a ne’er-do-well character immensely sympathetic in spite of his shortcomings.
