NEW YORK (AP) -- Herbert Ross, a choreographer and director who worked on films including "Funny Girl" with Barbra Streisand and "Steel Magnolias" with Julia Roberts, died Tuesday. He was 74. The cause of death was not immediately released.

Ross began his career as a dancer and started choreographing Broadway shows in the early 1950s. He was soon directing musical sequences and choreographed his first film, "Carmen Jones," with Dorothy Dandridge, in 1954.

In the 1970s, Ross directed Woody Allen's "Play it Again Sam" and was a frequent collaborator with playwright Neil Simon. Ross directed five Simon scripts, including "The Sunshine Boys" in 1975, "California Suite" in 1978 and 1981's "I Ought to Be in Pictures."

In 1977, Ross returned to his dancing roots with his acclaimed study of the ballet world, "The Turning Point," with Anne Bancroft, Shirley MacLaine and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The film earned numerous Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture.

His first wife, prima ballerina Nora Kaye, died of cancer in 1987. In 1989, he married Lee Radziwill, the sister of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. They divorced in 1999.

Ross enjoyed critical and box-office success in the 1980s and '90s with "Pennies From Heaven," "Soapdish" and "Boys on the Side."

His credits also include "The Secret of My Success," "The Owl and The Pussycat," "Footloose," "The Sunshine Boys" and "The Goodbye Girl."
