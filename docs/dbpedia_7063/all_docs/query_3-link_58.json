        "text": "HERBERT ROSS, who has died aged 74, was a former dancer and choreographer who became a film director; he was responsible for a string of stylish box office hits including Woody Allen's Play it Again Sam (1973), The Sunshine Boys (1976) and Steel Magnolias (1990).\n\nMany of Ross's films concerned the struggle of the individual to overcome loneliness and despair, and his occasional lapses into lachrymose sentimentality went down better with American than with British audiences. Nevertheless he won almost universal admiration for his subtle camera work and his skill in bringing out the best in his actors.\n\nRoss won his greatest critical acclaim for The Turning Point (1978). The film marked the screen debut of Mikhail Baryshnikov and explored the lives of a fading prima ballerina (Anne Bancroft) and a former dancer who gave up her career to raise a family (Shirley Maclaine). It earned numerous Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nThe son of a postal clerk, Herbert Ross was born at Brooklyn, New York, on May 13 1927. His mother died when he was nine and his father remarried and moved his family to Miami, Florida, where he opened a \"luncheonette\".\n\nYoung Herbert became obsessed with the stage and at the age of 15 dropped out of school and left home for New York where he became a dancer and chorus boy on Broadway.\n\nA broken ankle soon put paid to his dancing, but opened up a new career as a choreographer when, still recuperating, Ross visited an exhibition of Goya's paintings and etchings. He was so struck by the artist's sinister Caprichos series of etchings, he decided to try to interpret them as a ballet. First performed at a ballet workshop in 1950, Caprichos was such a critical success it was taken up by the Ballet Theatre company.\n\nFrom then on, Ross devoted himself to choreography and created several more short pieces for Ballet Theatre. He choreographed many Broadway shows and in 1954 arranged the dance sequences for Carmen Jones, Otto Preminger's updated film version of Bizet's opera.\n\nIn 1959 Ross married Nora Kaye, a prima ballerina with Ballet Theatre, and together they formed Ballet of Two Worlds, a company which toured Europe in 1960. In 1965 Ross was invited to choreograph the dances for Robert Mulligan's Inside Daisy Clover (1968), and for William Wyler's Funny Girl (1968), in which Barbra Streisand made her debut as Fanny Brice. It was while working on this film that Ross decided to try his hand at direction, having found that the actors had come to him for advice they could not get from Wyler.\n\nHis opportunity came when he was called in as a last minute replacement for Gower Champion who had withdrawn from Goodbye Mr Chips (1969). The film, an elaborate musical remake of the 1939 original, was panned by the critics as slushy and slow-moving, although it was partly redeemed by the immaculate performance of Peter O'Toole as the shy schoolmaster.\n\nRoss had more luck with The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), a comedy about a bumbling would-be writer (George Segal) who reports a fellow tenant (Barbra Streisand) for prostitution, but ends up as her lover. In 1972, Ross coaxed an unusually warm and three-dimensional performance from Woody Allen in Play It Again Sam, in which a film critic conjures up the ghost of Humphrey Bogart to help him through life's battles.\n\nIn The Last of Sheila (1973), a thriller set in the south of France, Ross won praise for the excellent acting which compensated to some degree for the film's impossibly complicated plot. By contrast, Funny Lady (1975) suffered from all the classic problems of the film sequel, with Barbra Streisand, in her second incarnation as Fanny Brice, becoming almost a caricature of herself.\n\nRoss hit a more productive vein with The Sunshine Boys (1975), a Neil Simon play about two cantankerous ageing vaudevillians (George Burns and Walter Matthau) who come together for a television engagement. The film led to a fruitful partnership with Neil Simon and Ross went on to direct several more of Simon's plays, including The Goodbye Girl (1977); California Suite (1978), a comedy set in a Beverly Hills hotel and starring Jane Fonda and Maggie Smith (who won an Oscar); I Ought to be in Pictures (1981); and Max Dugan Returns (1983). After the success of The Turning Point, Nijinsky (1980) was a lavishly-produced account of the lives of the two great legends of the Russian ballet, Nijinsky (George de la Pena) and Diaghilev (Alan Bates). Though praised for its period detail, the film was felt to dwell rather too much on the homosexual angle.\n\nRoss's other credits in the 1980s included Pennies From Heaven (1982), an adaptation of Dennis Potter's television serial; Footloose (1984), an absurd but pleasing tale about a local preacher whose authority is challenged by a young dancer; Protocol (1984); Dancers (1987); and The Secret of My Success (1987).\n\nRoss's last box office success Steel Magnolias was a sentimental comedy drama set around a Louisiana beauty parlour; Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her role as a newly-wed dying of complications brought on by diabetes."
