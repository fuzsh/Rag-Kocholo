        "text": "The Gratiot County Players (GCP) will be presenting the Neil Simon comedy “The Good Doctor” at The Strand Theatre in Alma.\n\n“The Good Doctor” is the first show of the GCP’s 2019 to 2020 season which also includes “Miss Bennett: Christmas at Pemberly” in December, “4 Weddings and an Elvis” in February and “Mama Mia!” in May.\n\nThe play’s show dates include October 18th, 19th, 25th, and 26th at 7:30 p.m. and October 20th and 27th at 2:30 p.m.\n\nNeil Simon is a well-known playwright and screenwriter who has created notable works like “The Odd Couple,” “Brighton Bech Memoirs,” and “Lost in Yonker” among other shows.\n\n“The Good Doctor” is based on the short stories of Anton Chekov and described in a press release from the GCP “as a comedy woven with music that is, by turns, charming, hilarious, sad, and touching.” There are ten different stories that are featured in the play which has the actors portraying multiple rolls.\n\n“The stories don’t connect onstage but are connected the humanity, humor, and tenderness that is featured in all the stories,” Marketing & Development Director for the GCP, Dawn Daniels said. “It’s designed for five actors, with three men and two women though we have eleven actors with four different women playing some of the different parts.”\n\nThe show centers around the character “the writer” who acts as a narrator and is meant to represent Chekov and how the stories pop into his head. “The writer” is being played by retired Alma College professor of music and longstanding GCP member, Scott Messing. He has played this the roll of “the writer” before during the 1995-1996 season and the current iteration of “The Good Doctor” will be his 41st show with the GCP.\n\n“It’s the same roll I did in past productions when the Gratiot County Players were in St. Louis,” Messing said. “It’s nice to remember why I liked the roll in the first place.”\n\nShow director Mike Klahre and assistant director Joshua Zeitler directed half of the ten stories, though Klahre has overall artistic control.\n\n“There are a variety of stories in this show,” show director, Mike Klahre said.”Some are quietly dramatic and others are really comedic. For my first time directing it’s a simple set and a simple idea.”\n\nKlahre also plays a roll one of the parts in this show as does the assistant director is Joshua Zeitler, who are both from Alma.\n\n“There were some casting difficulties and we both stepped in and we each do one of the scenes,” Klahre said.\n\nIn addition to Zeitler, Klahre, and Messing, the ensemble cast is comprised of Mount Pleasant resident William Campbell and Alma residents Dawn Daniels, Stephen DeJung, Dan Alward, Natalie DeJung, Kat Johns, Briley Bailey, and Maurie Luetkemeier, with piano accompaniment by Bob Crist from Ithaca.\n\nThe 52nd season of the GCP is being sponsored by Breckenridge Insurance Company of Michigan, Garr Tool, and Alma Optics. The Good Doctor is presented by special arrangement with Samuel French, Inc., a Concord Theatricals Company."
