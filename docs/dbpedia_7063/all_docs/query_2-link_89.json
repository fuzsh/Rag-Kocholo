        "text": "Horror is a polarizing genre. While one group of readers might find the suspense of each plot exciting, others may find the content too disturbing and avoid the genre altogether. Other readers fall in the middle, tending to go back and forth between the two extremes. If you are a regular reader of the genre, you probably know that some of the best horror books trigger a visceral reaction, which is why authors like Stephen King and Mary Shelley are well-respected for this craft.\n\nTop Horror Books\n\nSeveral classic horror novels have set the standard for novels after them —they have become the benchmarks for novels published within the past decade. Some of the best of these novels include Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) and Stephen King’s The Shining (1977). These books have all broken boundaries in their way, creating a blueprint for the future of this literary category. These novels have not only sent chills down our spines, but have also influenced how horror stories are created and understood. If you’re new to the genre, here’s a selection of some of the best horror books ever.\n\n25. We Have Always Lived in the Castle By Shirley Jackson (1962)\n\nAlthough Shirley Jackson’s published We Have Always Lived in the Castle in 1962, it remains one of the most popular horror novels of all time. The gothic plot follows the lives of 18-year-old Mary Katherine “Merricat” Blackwood, her older sister Constance and their Uncle Julian, who uses a wheelchair. The odd trio are the only people who survived an arsenic poisoning that killed John and Ellen Blackwood, Constance and Merricat’s parents, Dorothy, their aunt and their younger brother. Although six years have passed since the mysterious poisoning, the three have become comfortable living a reclusive lifestyle, which attracts a lot of gossip from the neighbors.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: This novel is an excellent read for fans who enjoy psychological horror, literary fiction, or stories that explore themes of isolation and suspicion.\n\n24. The Haunting of Hill House By Shirley Jackson (1959)\n\nShirley Jackson makes another return to this list with her 1959 novel, The Haunting of Hill House, a story that was inspired by 19th-century psychic researchers. The novel centers around four characters: Dr. John Montague, a scholar intent on proving the existence of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents her overbearing mother; Theodora, an edgy artist; and Luke Sanderson, the heir to Hill House. Montague brings these four together, hoping to collect paranormal scientific evidence. To do this, he rents Hill House and gathers a group of individuals with experiences with the supernatural. What starts as an experiment of the unknown quickly escalates into terror for everyone staying there.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: The Haunting of Hill House is a psychological horror book with gothic elements and is ideal for readers who are drawn to classic horror.\n\n23. Let the Right One In By John Ajvide Lindqvist (2004)\n\nIn John Ajvide Lindqvist’s Let the Right One In, Lindqvist follows the lives of two unlikely characters: Oskar, a lonely 12-year-old boy, and Eli, a mysterious vampire child. Oskar, a bullied middle schooler, lives with his mother in one of the blocks of flats in a drab neighborhood in Blackeberg, a deserted Stockholm suburb during the early 1980s. When Oskar and Eli meet and strike an unlikely friendship, it brings more excitement to Oskar’s life than he could ever imagine. This friendship leads Oskar to develop special abilities, which he uses to confront his bullies at school.\n\nWhere to read: Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWho should read: Lindqvist’s Let the Right One In is a good read for people who enjoy stories about underdogs whose lives take a swift turn in the most unexpected ways.\n\n22. The Case Against Satan By Ray Russell (1962)\n\nIn The Case Against Satan, Ray Russell goes to great lengths to show readers the impact of demonic possession through the unsettling story of Susan Garth, an ordinary high school student who faithfully attends mass until she suddenly becomes entirely against it. Her increasingly violent behavior also matches this repulsion for the church. As Susan’s behavior becomes increasingly volatile and dangerous, her father brings her to two local parish priests, Bishop Crimmings and Father Gregory Sargent, who plan to cast out the demons in Susan with an exorcism. The two religious men will soon find that the forces attacking Susan are far more sinister than they could have imagined.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: Readers who are fascinated by books with plots that combine religion and its contrast with demonic possession.\n\n21. The Night Eaters: She Eats the Night By Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda (2022)\n\nIn their debut of the graphic novel horror trilogy, The Night Eaters: She Eats the Night, award-winning duo Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda introduce us to Chinese American twins, Milly and Billy, who are dealing with the pressure of trying to keep their family’s struggling Chinese restaurant afloat and managing their chaotic lives. Their situation takes a dark turn when their mother, Ipo, who is visiting from Hong Kong, asks them for help with cleaning out a broken-down neighboring house, which has been the scene of a horrific murder. What starts as a tedious task quickly turns into something more terrifying.\n\nWhere to read: Barnes & Noble.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy plot twists and like to find horror in unimaginable places will find this book to be an appropriate literary escape.\n\n20. Nothing But Blackened Teeth By Cassandra Khaw (2021)\n\nEven the name of this novella is suspiciously scary. Cassandra Khaw’s horror novella comes to life through the tensions of family and relationships set in a haunted Japanese mansion from the Heian era. In this story, five friends come to the mansion to celebrate their friend’s wedding. Apart from Nadia and Faiz, who are getting married, other notable characters include Phillip, the wealthy and charming guy and Cat, the book’s narrator and arguably the most memorable character. At first, everyone is happy and upbeat, but that soon dissolves into something much more ominous.\n\nWhere to read: Barnes & Noble.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy reading about complex human relationships and gore will enjoy this novel.\n\n19. Road of Bones By Christopher Golden (2022)\n\nChristopher Golden’s Road of Bones is a creepy spin on atmospheric storytelling. Felix Teigland, a curious American documentary filmmaker, is determined to explore the infamous Kolyma Highway in Siberia, known as the “Road of Bones.” This highway has become a burial ground for the Soviet Union’s gulag prisoners. It is known for being the site of numerous motorist accidents, where drivers are left to freeze to death beneath the frosty road. Felix believes this territory will inspire his next documentary, which he hopes to title Life and Death on the Road of Bones. To do this, he and his team set out on an adventure to the site; however, what they found was eerily different from what they had imagined.\n\nWhere to read: Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy stories with plots that delve into spooky historical facts and ghostly apparitions will find Road of Bones very satisfying.\n\n18. The Only Good Indians By Stephen Graham Jones (2020)\n\nThis novel focuses on the experiences of four American Indian men — Ricky, Lewis, Gabe, and Cass — who belong to the Blackfeet culture. An elk-hunting hunting incident forever changes their lives from their childhood and this forms the basis of the story. The plot of this novel traces the mental and spiritual fallout of what happened during that elk hunt and the horrifying accident that took place after that. Jones brilliantly explores the cultural implications of the young men’s actions and shows readers the reality of Native American life that feels thorough and three-dimensional.\n\nWhere to read: Simon & Schuster.\n\nWho should read: Readers who like stories that highlight cultural identity and the influence of the past on the present will appreciate the intense and haunting themes of this novel.\n\n17. Doing Harm By Kelly Parsons (2014)\n\nSteve Mitchell, a brilliant and confident surgeon, seems to have everything going for him—a promising career at Boston’s renowned University Hospital and a life headed in the right direction. However, when a series of patient deaths begin to happen at the hospital, it becomes obvious that the killer is targeting Steve’s reputation and is out to upend everything his life stands for. The tension escalates when Steve finds himself as the primary suspect behind the crimes; he must now do everything to save his reputation.\n\nWhere to read: Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWho should read: Doing Harm is a good read for readers who enjoy medical-themed plots and are fascinated by out-of-the-box storylines.\n\n16. Beloved By Toni Morrison (1987)\n\nBeloved is an American literary classic and an important work of literature set in Ohio after the Civil War. Morrison introduces readers to a freed slave woman named Sethe, who is haunted by her memories of slavery, the murder of her child, and the years she spent struggling to get her life back after she escaped slavery. Tormented by the memories of her daughter’s ghost, Sethe is pushed to face her complex past and disjointed present and future.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy evocative stories by Black authors that tap into serious elements of history and provocative themes will enjoy this book.\n\n15. Roald Dahl’s Book of Ghost Stories By Roald Dahl (1983)\n\nShortly before his death, Dahl combed through over 749 short stories in the British Museum Library and chose a collection of 14 of the best stories to create this anthology. Although this book is a collection of spooky stories, Dahl perfectly defined its core, and the essence of horror as a genre by saying “Spookiness is, after all, the real purpose of the ghost story. It should give you the creeps and disturb your thoughts.”\n\nWhere to read: Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy a collection of short stories with various plots.\n\n14. Those Across The River By Christopher Buehlman (2011)\n\nChristopher Buehlman’s Those Across The River is a body of work that grows increasingly unsettling the more the reader digs into its storyline. The novel follows the lives of a failed professor, Frank Nichols, and his wife Eudora, who move back to his family estate in Whitbrow, Georgia, hoping for a fresh start and the chance to rebuild what is left of his family’s old plantation. At first, Frank and Eudora believe that the small town is peaceful and idyllic for the new lifestyle, but they soon discover that this new environment will become an eerie backdrop for Southern Gothic tradition and a supernatural, frightening mystery steeped in tradition.\n\nWhere to read: Barnes & Noble.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy plots with horror, cultural rituals and traditions.\n\n13. The Ruins By Scott Smith (2006)\n\nScott Smith’s The Ruins isn’t just a page-turner because of its multiple layers. It is an intense meditation into the nature of terror. Set in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, the story follows a group of friends who are on vacation in Mexico and make a few friends while there. When one person from the group wanders into the jungle to find his brother, the rest of the group follows, opening up a can of worms.\n\nWhere to read: Barnes & Noble.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy horror, fantasy, adventure, and fiction will be drawn to the heart-pounding plot in Smith’s The Ruins.\n\n12. Coraline By Neil Gaiman (2002)\n\nNeil Gaiman’s Coraline is a memorable novel because it uses the classic plot that implies that even the most comforting places can carry dark secrets. The novel taps into one of our deepest fears: that the familiar could harbor grim surprises. Young Coraline Jones lives in a flat with 21 windows and 14 doors; 13 of those doors open and close. One day, Caroline walks through one of the mysterious doors and that changes her life instantly.\n\nWhere to read: HarperCollinsPublisher.\n\nWho should read: Young readers who are ready to start engaging with the horror genre.\n\n11. White Is for Witching By Helen Oyeyemi (2009)\n\nFollowing the death of their matriarch, Lily, her twins, Miranda and Eliot, along with their father, Luc, begin to fall apart. As the family mourns, the house becomes a character in its own right, creaking with unsettling noise and echoing the family’s growing unease. Miranda’s increasingly bizarre behavior only makes things worse. In this story, Oyeyemi brilliantly incorporates themes of demonic influence, paranoia and the isolating and unexciting repetition of daily life.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy gothic horror, mystery and suspense will enjoy this book.\n\n10. Something Wicked This Way Comes By Ray Bradbury (1962)\n\nRay Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes is pure Bradbury: dark and filled with foreboding and is arguably one of his best horror stories. In the novel, two young boys meet a mysterious man named Mr. Dark who can grant the wishes of the townspeople. For the young who yearn to grow up too quickly, he offers the allure of premature adulthood and for the elderly, he tempts them with the promise of restored youth.\n\nWhere to read: Simon & Schuster.\n\nWho should read: This book is a perfect read for people who are fascinated by mysterious protagonists.\n\n9. The House Across the Lake By Riley Sager (Todd Ritter) (2022)\n\nSome of the best literary horror stories have a fascination with secluded locations, wealth and glamor. One of the most effective uses of this trope is Riley Sager’s The House Across the Lake, where Casey Fletcher, an alcoholic actress, moves back to her family home in rural Vermont to escape the limelight. During this period, she strikes a friendship with her wealthy neighbors, former runway model Katherine Royce and Tom, a developer. Despite their outer facade, it becomes evident that there is more to the couple than meets the eye and when Katherine mysteriously goes missing, her suspicion deepens.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: This book is a perfect read for those who enjoy an extra dose of pulse-pounding mystery and suspense.\n\n8. Carrion Comfort By Dan Simmons (1989)\n\nAlthough most people are afraid of physical threats that could harm or steal their bodies, this novel introduces a far more uncommon type of fear: The human mind. The plot follows Saul Laski, a Holocaust survivor, who was imprisoned in 1942 at the Chełmno extermination camp. Determined to resist the night raids, Saul’s willpower is tested when an unspoken, supernatural force compels him to obey the Schutzstaffel's commands. This harrowing experience marks the beginning of a decades-long battle against a hidden group of individuals who possess the horrifying ability to control and dominate minds.\n\nWhere to read: Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWho should read: This is a great book for readers who appreciate horror as a genre and like plots that are mind-bending and intriguing.\n\n7. The Terror By Dan Simmons (2007)\n\nDan Simmons appears on this list again with this classic horror story, which reimagines the true events of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, led by Sir John Franklin, a doomed voyage of the 19th-century British Royal Navy. While rooted in historical fact, Dan Simmons adds a twist to the plot that forms the baseline of the story. The story follows the crew’s struggle against the Arctic cold and little food supplies, but their fate gets worse when they become the target of an evil predator who terrifies them and turns their fight for survival into a battle against an ancient, yet evil force.\n\nWhere to read: Hachette Book Group.\n\nWho should read: This is a great book for readers who enjoy historically-themed novels.\n\n6. Dracula By Bram Stoker (1987)\n\nBram Stoker’s 1897 horror classic, Dracula, is told through letters, diary entries and newspaper articles and even though the story doesn’t have a single protagonist, it often centers on Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor who travels to Count Dracula’s castle in Transylvania to get some business done. What should be a straight-forward order of business quickly escalates into a chilling plot when Jonathan discovers that Dracula is a vampire.\n\nWhere to read: Simon & Schuster.\n\nWho should read: Dracula is a classic for readers who enjoy historical books and folklore.\n\n5. Ghost Story By Peter Straub (1979)\n\nPeter Straub’s Ghost Story follows the story of a group of elderly men called the Chowder Society, who frequently gather to share ghost stories. What appears to be a harmless tradition among these old friends holds a darker past. Several years ago, they were involved in a tragic accident that led to the death of a young woman, and now they are all haunted by their invasive memories and the evil and forces that they have accidentally triggered.\n\nWhere to read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: Staub’s classic book is excellent for readers who are drawn to this book.\n\n4. The Strangler By William Landay (2007)\n\nWilliam Landay’s second novel, The Strangler, is a mystery thriller set in 1963 Boston that introduces readers to aley brothers: Joe, a troubled cop; Ricky, a thief; and Michael, a prosecutor. When a brutal killer targets women close to the Daley family, the unlikely trio is forced to unite and get to the bottom of who is behind the crime. As the investigation continues, it brings buried family secrets to the forefront.\n\nWhere to Read: Penguin Random House.\n\nWho should read: Readers who enjoy books with themes of crime, horror and suspense.\n\n3. IT By Stephen King (1986)\n\nMany avid readers will probably agree that Stephen King’s IT is one of his most disturbing novels. In IT, seven adults who were once childhood friends return to Derry, Maine, where they once fought a creature that preyed on the town’s vulnerable children. As teenagers, they believed they had defeated the creature, but they made a pact to return to Derry if the horror ever resurfaced. Thirty years later, with news of child murders terrorizing Derry, the adults must once again confront the evil force they thought they had vanquished.\n\nWhere to Read: Simon & Schuster.\n\nWho should read: King’s IT is a perfect book for readers who can handle horror that many might consider disturbing.\n\n2. Frankenstein By Mary Shelley (1818)\n\nMary Shelley’s masterpiece, Frankenstein, is considered one of the best horror masterpieces of all time. The novel pushes readers to answer the question: “What are the consequences for humans daring to play God?” Victor Frankenstein, an intelligent scientist, believes that he has achieved an extraordinary accomplishment of creating life. At first, Victor believes he has made the perfect creature, but is shocked to discover that the specimen he has created is hideous. Because of this, Victor rejects the creature and theCcreature is also shunned by people, which leads his life to become defined by despair, loneliness and the search for retribution.\n\nWhere to Read: Simon & Schuster.\n\nWho should read: This is a great book for readers who are loyal to classic horror and love the intellectual aspects of it.\n\n1. The Shining By Stephen King (1977)\n\nIt would be a mistake not to include this Stephen King masterpiece at the top of this list. Middle-aged writer Jack Torrance, a troubled recovering alcoholic, hopes to overcome his writer’s block by moving with his family to the historic and isolated Overlook Hotel for winter, where he will work as a winter caretaker. At first, Jack believes the hotel is the perfect place to regroup and reconnect with his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, but the hotel holds a truly dark past that threatens to torment him until he destroys his family. Young Danny, Jack’s son, has “the shining,” a psychic ability to see the hotel’s dark past and its evil influence on his father’s troubled psyche.\n\nWhere to Read: Penguin Random House."
