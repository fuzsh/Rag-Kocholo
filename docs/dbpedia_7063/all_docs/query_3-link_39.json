        "text": "Look at this partial body of work: Movies that were not only hits but watchable more than once!! Turning Point, Play It Again, Sam, The Sunshine Boys, Boys On The Side, The Goodbye Girl, Pennies From Heaven, Footloose, Steel Magnolias, My Blue Heaven. Boys On The Side. Go look at his other major credits on IMDb......Let's get this cat back on the scene!!!\n\nHis films were unremarkable. He was pretty much a hack. Pennies from Heaven is the only really outstanding film of his that I've seen. I did enjoy The Owl and the Pussycat and The Seven Per-Cent Solution and know that there are fans of Footloose but most of his films are mediocrities including the overrated Steel Magnolias, The Goodbye Girl and The Turning Point. Undercover Blues, My Blue Heaven, Protocol, Max Dugan Returns, I Ought to Be in Pictures, Nijinsky aren't impressive credits.\n\nHe was also a go to Broadway show doctor for a while till wife Nora Kaye quipped \"If Herb is such a good show doctor why do all the patients die?\"\n\nI always think of his technique of opening up a play, a semi-specialty of his: suddenly characters are having a conversation that's a verbatim scene from the play, so it's still talk talk talk, but they're walking down the street or out in the yard doing something outside on some slim pretext. Actors moving, the camera moving.\n\nHe seems to have been reviled unanimously by the Steel Magnolias ladies. You never hear them say anything good about him.\n\nEven his PENNIES FROM HEAVEN wasn't as good as the British version. But it was impressive in many ways.\n\nAnd THE TURNING POINT is just an average soap opera lifted up by some strong acting and dancing.\n\nI never heard about the STEEL MAGNOLIAS cast hating him. Is there a link to more info?\n\nRoss' best work was as a choreographer.\n\n[quote] I did enjoy The Owl and the Pussycat and The Seven Per-Cent Solution\n\nI agree with r2. Several interesting films such as those plus Last of Sheila but mostly he seemed to have specialized in films for a girl alone without a date.\n\nAnd Sheila I mostly credit the cleverness of the script, not so much the direction\n\n[quote] So, how do suppose he bagged \"Play It Again, Sam?\" Woody had power then. If Herbert was a hack, why is he directing Joy Bang?\n\nAt r12 I asked the same question and then deleted it after glancing at the IMDB Play It Again Sam trivia.\n\nIn an interview with 'Cinema' magazine in March 1972, Woody Allen said: \"I would never want to direct a play into a movie. I would only be interested in working on original projects for the screen. I was already at work on 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask (1972)', and I didn't want to spend a year doing a project that I had done on Broadway\". Woody Allen hoped that the film, directed by Herbert Ross, would garner \"a nice, solid, funny commercial picture, and hopefully entice a broader audience for me than I get with my own films\"."
