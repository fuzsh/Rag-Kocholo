The semiconductor industry is poised for growth, and it's exciting to see how these partnerships will shape the future of engineering. #chipmakers #engineeringstudents #semiconductors #futureofwork #innovation\n\nüí•Today, Austin's Samsung Semiconductor and The University of Texas at Austin cemented a #legacy program to develop the the next generation of semiconductor leaders in innovation. Here are the highlights: üå± Shared goal of growing the critically important semiconductor workforce of the future üß± Cements Austin‚Äôs reputation as the leader in semiconductor education, research and manufacturing üéì Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin; top engineering school in the nation relentless in its pursuit to change the world ü¶ã The partnership transforms advanced manufacturing in Texas for many years to come üí∞ Includes funds for recruiting and supporting undergraduate and graduate students to study semiconductor manufacturing üìçPositions the state as a leader in the burgeoning U.S. semiconductor industry üíµ$3.7 million to the Cockrell School, a perennial top-10 engineering school, as part of its 5-star workforce development plan and emphasis on R&D üë®üéì Scholarships for 40 undergraduate students and fellowships for 10 graduate students üî¨ Provides a skilled and large workforce in Central Texas üí™ Solidifies Cockrell School of Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin as a leader in semiconductor education, research and manufacturing ü§òüèΩHook'em #opportunityaustin #austinregion #workforce #talent #engineer #semiconductorleaders #researchdevelopment #hightech #manufacturing\n\nThe semiconductor industry has faced a key challenge for decades and it‚Äôs not about the end of Moore‚Äôs Law, it‚Äôs the decreasing number of engineers graduating from university with electrical engineering degrees. According to a survey conducted by Deloitte, there will be an additional 1,000,000 skilled employees needed in our industry worldwide by 2030, across disciplines ranging from fab technicians to design engineers. With the ongoing decline of students graduating with at least their BSEE, this presents a major obstacle for semiconductor organizations, especially startups. It‚Äôs a challenge that Ricky Lau, CTO and co-founder at The Six Semiconductor (TSS) is very familiar with. Rickey has spent his entire career in the industry, beginning with the legendary ATI Technologies, then moving to AMD before co-founding TSS. During a recent trip to TSS‚Äôs headquarters, Ricky explained that when he was enrolled at his alma mater the University of Toronto a graduating class might have a couple hundred EE students. Nowadays, there may be as few as 30 or 40. One of the causes behind this seismic shift has been the rise of lucrative software programming jobs that have attracted students to become programmers, hoping to develop the next app that becomes a global phenomenon. Other issues that might not be as obvious include: ‚û°Ô∏èMany young people report that the semiconductor industry is ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to them and they haven‚Äôt heard of it before; a classic marketing and awareness problem. ‚û°Ô∏èThere‚Äôs low access to STEM curriculum in lower grade levels, especially in underrepresented communities that may harbor the next generation‚Äôs best talent pools. ‚û°Ô∏èThere has been a lack of industry-academia partnerships to co-develop curriculum and increase the number of programs that can create inroads into the industry.. The world‚Äôs largest semiconductor companies are working collectively to solve these problems over time, yet time is a resource that that startups like TSS don‚Äôt have in abundance, so they have to take a different approach. How does TSS do it? They‚Äôve developed a strong internship program that exposes aspiring electrical engineers to the many different aspects of their design flow: from architecture to validation. This raises their awareness and confidence on engineering topics, making them more well-rounded and insightful about where they want to contribute. Many of TSS‚Äô interns return as full-time employees after graduation, and those team members have become integral contributors, helping drive their success. It‚Äôs a model that clearly works! We‚Äôre encouraged by the leaders at TSS and their approach to solving their talent challenges of today while focusing on developing engineers who will become the leaders of tomorrow.

Here's a snapshot of the data-driven transformations shaping the semiconductor landscape: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of Legislative Acts: The CHIPS and Science Act provided $52 billion in subsidies, driving $166 billion in investments and job growth within a year. This includes significant investments from industry giants like Intel, TSMC, Micron, and GlobalFoundries, with new fabs and expansions planned across the U.S. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rise of New Fabs: By 2025, 67 new fabs or fab expansions are set to begin construction, signaling a major leap forward in domestic manufacturing capacity. Notable developments include Intel's investment in Arizona and Ohio, TSMC's expansion in Phoenix, and Micron's megafab in New York. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Investments in Education: Recognizing the importance of a skilled workforce, institutions like Purdue University, Arizona State University, The Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have launched semiconductor-focused programs. Samsung's apprenticeship program at Austin Community College further enhances skill development. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Job Creation: The semiconductor industry is poised to add 115,000 jobs by 2030, with increasing interest among students and young professionals. Applications at semiconductor companies surged nearly 80% between 2022 and 2023, reflecting growing opportunities and demand. Amidst this seismic shift, we are compelled to ask: What groundbreaking innovations will emerge as the semiconductor industry surges forward, shaping our world in ways we are yet to imagine? üí°‚ùìÔ∏è #SemiconductorIndustry #CHIPSAct #Innovation Pictue Source: CSIAC\n\nIntel's Chandler operations catalyzed partnerships between the company, local schools, colleges, and universities to create tailored engineering programs. This allowed graduates to directly enter Intel's high-paying jobs. In Ohio, Intel is taking a similar approach, working with technical schools and higher education to develop semiconductor-focused curriculum. Beyond supplying Intel's workforce needs directly, these programs will build Ohio's STEM expertise. In Chandler, the focus on education led other tech companies to establish operations there. After meeting with Intel engineers who went through these programs, we fully expect Ohio's tech education ecosystem to flourish similarly. For Ohio, Intel's presence could similarly attract more technology and research investment, potentially making the state a top destination for tech talent. From primary schools to universities, Intel's partnerships can enrich STEM education across Ohio. With Chandler as a blueprint, educators have a clear model to leverage Intel's arrival for long-term enhancement of technical education and workforce alignment. This rising-tide effect will extend beyond supplying Intel's own major hiring demands. Housing investors should support projects around universities and colleges ramping up STEM programs. New faculty and expanded student populations will increase demand for rentals and housing. ü§ù Let's connect and follow our social media pages! üí¨ Send us a message if you have any questions about investing or üåê Check us out at www.keesinvestments.com #IntelEffect #Education #Investing #investor #STEMPrograms #Students #faculty #workforce #Chandler #Ohio #Partnership\n\nWe'd like to congratulate Alexis McPeck, who recently received the Intel Corporation Scholarship for Women in Technology. This competitive scholarship was awarded to only 25 women in Ohio! Not only were recipients awarded with a scholarship, but eight were selected to visit the Intel semiconductor factory in Phoenix, Arizona. \"I wasn't sure how I wanted to pursue [technology] until I saw COTC's partnership with Intel. That got me looking into all the technology programs they had, and I landed on electrical engineering.\" This scholarship aims to empower and solidify the role of women in technology. \"It's a very rewarding thing to be a woman in engineering,\" McPeck says. \"To play an important role in a primarily male-dominated field is very empowering. And to know that I could potentially inspire other young women to also jump in and pursue a path like mine is so cool.\" McPeck, like many COTC students, had a nontraditional journey to college. \"I'm a single mother, so I thought going to college wasn't going to be an option for me,\" explains McPeck. \"I'm so glad I made the decision to try and go back to school, because I've learned that I can do what I initially thought was impossible. COTC has been great with helping me through this experience.\" \"I couldn't believe how big of an operation it was. I learned so much about the culture of Intel and what they're trying to accomplish. They seem to really care for their employees,\" McPeck enthuses. \"I also learned about the many potential career paths I could take at Intel with my degree and what a day in the life of those jobs would look like. There is so much room for growth. We spoke to many people who have climbed the ladder, from all the way down where I'd potentially be starting!\" McPeck describes the Intel-sponsored Phoenix trip as \"one of the coolest opportunities I think I could've ever gotten!\" COTC is just as excited to see students engaging and participating in these opportunities, which reaffirms how dedicated and outstanding our students truly are.

Shout out for a full-throttle, all-hands-on-deck \"Call to Action!\" Igniting American manufacturing will require a concerted effort from all fronts‚Äîgovernment, academia, and manufacturers. The government, often known for its red tape, must provide the framework and incentives to foster growth. Academia, in its ivory towers, should push the boundaries of research and development, feeding innovation into the industry. But let‚Äôs be clear‚Äîthe lion's share of the work lies with the manufacturers. They are the ones who will do the heavy lifting, turning lofty policies and academic theories into tangible products and thriving businesses. Together, we can transform blueprints into booming hubs of innovation and opportunity, ensuring our manufacturing sector not only survives but thrives in the global market. Let's get the lead out! The time is now.....or it will be never, for American manufacturing, the Semiconductor and EV Ecosystems, nor the Global Data Sphere, and most importantly, for the American middle class. It‚Äôs time to stop waiting for a miracle and start making one! #workforcedevelopment #stem #cte #upskilling #vocation #vocationaltraining #retraining #apprenticeships #ignitingamericanmanufacturing #semiconductor #chipsact #reshoring #inflationreductionacts #americanmanufacturingsupercycle\n\nCongratulations to Micron and Polytechnics in Singapore on this MOU, we need more of the Corporate World to support our Students with Sponsorships to take on STEM Education of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. * Under the tie-up, the chipmaker‚Äôs philanthropic arm will offer 20 scholarships to first- and second-year students doing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses.
