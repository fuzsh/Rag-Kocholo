        "text": "Welcome to the official Film/Art Gallery collection of original Herbert Ross vintage movie posters from his critically acclaimed catalog of timeless cinematic creations.\n\nAmerican actor, choreographer, director, and producer Herbert David Ross (May 13, 1927 – October 9, 2001) made his first Broadway dance performance with Something for the Boys, Follow the Girls (1944), Laffing Room Only (1945), Beggar's Holiday (1947), and Look, Ma, I'm Dancin'.\n\nHe was a choreographer for the Arthur Schwartz-Dorothy Fields musical A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951), worked on TV for All Star Revue, The Milton Berle Show, The Steve Allen Plymouth Show, and on Carmen Jones (1954), plus some TV specials: The Jerry Lewis Show (1957), Wonderful Town (1958), Meet Me in St Louis, and A Christmas Festival (1959).\n\nRoss choreographed The Young Ones (1961), starring Cliff Richard, and worked as the musical director on The Gay Life (1961-62), I Can Get It for You Wholesale (1962), directed by Arthur Laurents, starring Barbra Streisand, Bondage Gladiator Sexy (1961), The Apple Tree (1967), directed by Mike Nichols, and Funny Girl (1968) by Ray Stark.\n\nRoss directed in Broadway for Neil Simon's Chapter Two (1979), Pennies from Heaven (1981), and the film version of I Ought to Be in Pictures (1982). His last film with Simon was Max Dugan Returns (1983), and he had a huge hit with Footloose (1984), Protocol (1984) with Goldie Hawn, The Secret of My Success (1987) with Michael J. Fox, and his one last big hit Steel Magnolias (1989), and many more.\n\nIn 1959, he married Nora Kaye, then to Lee Radziwill which ultimately ended in divorce in 2001, shortly before his death on 2001 from heart failure in New York City.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery’s collection of original Herbert Ross movie posters includes a 40x60 poster of The Last of Shiela, a rare contest style poster for playful whodunit, written by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins. Herbert Ross poster collection also includes a 1 Sheet (27x41) of The Godbye Girl, the big Neil Simon hit and Richard Dreyfuss' Best Actor Oscar. The collection also includes other Herbert Ross posters.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery movie posters are original prints and film poster collectibles. These are original movie posters. We do not carry any movie poster reproductions or reprints of any kind."
