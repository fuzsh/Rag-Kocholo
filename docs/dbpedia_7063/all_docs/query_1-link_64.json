        "text": "by Playhouse 2000\n\nJun. 23 - Jul. 02, 2023\n\nFridays-Sundays\n\nI Ought To Be In Pictures tells the story of out-of-work Hollywood writer Herb, whose past catches up to him when Libby, his almost-forgotten but supremely confident daughter from a failed marriage shows up at his door, asking for his help with a start in the movie business. Simon’s famous wit is on full display as we watch Herb try to figure out how to be a dad to Libby, a better partner to his long-suffering girlfriend Steffy, maybe even a better man, and give Libby what she really needs.\n\nThe show will star David (Last Gas) Cummings as Herb, Emery (Blind Date) Dorman as Libby, and Michele VanFossen (Fuddy Meers) as \"Steffy.\" It’s directed by Sheldon Boyce with Brad Gilbert as assistant director/stage manager.\n\nI Ought to Be in Pictures\n\nby Neil Simon\n\nPlayhouse 2000\n\nWe're moving the opening date of I Ought To Be In Pictures back to Friday, June 23, presenting six performances, and closing on Sunday, July 2.
