        "text": "On April 8, at 8 p.m., there will be another opening of another show at the Sampson Community Theatre.\n\nHave you heard of “The Odd Couple” “Come Blow Your Horn,” “Barefoot In The Park” or “Prisoner Of Second Avenue”? If you have, you know these were all directed by Tom Wilbur on our big stage and they were all written by Neil Simon, who has written about 30 plays that have appeared on Broadway with many of them being adapted as a movie.\n\nOn April 8, “I Ought To Be In Pictures” will join this list with other performances on Friday, April 15 at 8 p.m., Saturday, April 9 and April 16 at 8 p.m. and Sunday, April 10 and April 17 at 3 p.m. The shows are sponsored by The Florist and Antiques of Warsaw.\n\nAll patrons are asked to mark your calendar for the Patron Appreciation Event Saturday, April 23 at 8 p.m. where all valid patrons will be freely entertained with a Las Vegas type show which will be taped to submit as an audition tape for potential entertainment on a cruise ship over the summer by Taylor Michaels. It will be a mix of music and magic.\n\nPatron Sponsor tickets are available by calling Brenda Martin at 990-4510. These tickets allow two people to attend every show we produce and get their names included in every program at a reduced rate .\n\nUPCOMING EVENTS\n\nI OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES — Directed by Tom Wilbur. Sponsored by The Florist and Antiques of Warsaw. April 8, 9, 10 and April 15,16, 17.\n\nCATS — June 16, 17, 18, 19 and June 23, 24, 25, 26.\n\nIN THE HEIGHTS — Date To Be Determined\n\nHOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING — Date to be determined\n\nELF, Jr. — Dec. 2, 3, 4 and Dec. 9, 10, 11\n\nTHOUGHTS UNTIL NEXT WEEK:\n\n• If we don’t believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don’t believe in it at all….Norm Chomsky\n\n• There’s no reality except the one contained within us. That’s why so many people live an unreal life. They take images outside them for reality and never allow the world within them to assert itself.\n\n• There is a top-secret recipe for success. Keep this secret mantra: “Work hard”."
