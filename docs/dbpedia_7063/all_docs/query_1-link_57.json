        "text": "(Looney Tunes S6 E4:)\n\n(Porky & Daffy)\n\nMove over Roger Rabbit, Porky Pig was stepping off the page and getting into real-world hijinks decades before 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.\n\n\"Well, if you say so, I'll tear up your contract, if that's what you want ... Y-yes ... Well, if that's the way you feel about it, it's all right with me ... Okay, Porky. Don't forget me when you're a star ... He'll be back.\"\n\nIt has been fascinating scrolling through all the early seasons of Looney Tunes, and noticing that Porky was their main character before the focus seemed to move over to Bugs around the 7th season. In this cartoon Daffy wants to take over Porky's stardom, so he…\n\nI do not like to be in the position of declaring Friz Freleng to be an obviously better director of animated short films than Bob Clampett. But Freleng's first Looney Tune in six years, his first film ever with Porky Pig, and only the second Looney Tune in over a year not directed by Clampett, well, it just absolutely hands Clampett's ass to him. This is a splendid, splendid bit of energetic metahumor, far more ambitious in breaking the fourth wall for madcap comic effect than the Fleischers' similar games with Koko the clown in the 1920s, and just as wild in its attempts to poke fun at the animation industry as a subset of the greater movie industry in…\n\n''LUUUUUUNCCCCH!''\n\nNot only does this one have Daffy Duck at his most self-absorbed Daffiest Duckiest, as he persuades Porky Pig to tear up the contract he has with Leon Schlesinger so Porky can go work in feature films as ''Bette Davis' leading man'' for 3 grand a week [''What's Errol Flynn got that I haven't?''], which would in turn give my beloved opportunistic duck idol Porky's top star spot at their studio... but the early, black and white blending of the meta live-action world with the cartoon characters themselves [a clear influence for Robert Zemeckis' masterwork, Who Framed Roger Rabbit] is absolutely breathtaking in its detail, such as how contact is convincingly made with the tangible and intangible, in shaking…\n\nThere's three separate things that I think make this of note; the first and most obvious is that this is a live action - animation hybrid that I don't think was done all that often with Looney Tunes, so there's something novel about that (of course, with this 1940 release, this is nearly 20 years after the first of the Alice shorts from Disney, Alice's Wonderland so this isn't groundbreaking). The second is the behind the scenes sort of feeling to this, which I am a bit of a sucker for, and it's a part of why I enjoy things like Disney's full studio tour that would come out the following year as The Reluctant Dragon. The third is that…"
