        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nComing to 4K Ultra HD and Digital from director Herbert Ross and Sony Pictures Home Entertainments celebrating the 35th Anniversary of release is the beloved story of women who are STEEL MAGNOLIAS.\n\nIn the quaint southern town of Chinquapin Parish in Louisiana, a young Annelle Dupuy (Daryl Hannah) is looking to restart her life in the new town with a job at an at-home beauty salon owned by Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton). Cross town, M’Lynn Eatenton (Sally Fields) is attempting to get her home together for a reception after the wedding of her daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts).\n\nCausing problems is her husband Drum (Tom Skerritt) who thinks shooting birds is a good thing prior to the wedding. To get away, M’Lynn and Shelby head off to Truvy’s to get their hair done where they see the very intense Louisa Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine). Amused by her is Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis) who likes to poke her friend. While getting her hair done, Shelby, who suffers from diabetes, has an attack that brings the salon to a standstill.\n\nAt the wedding, Shelby marries Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott) and Annelle meets bartender Sammy DeSoto (Kevin J. O’Connor). Months go by and Shelby visits home for the Christmas gathering and announces she is expecting. M’Lynn is horrified knowing that her health is at risk.\n\nThe girls come together to help their friend and support everything that they are going through. M’Lynn, Truvy, Clairee, Annelle, and Louisa know there is nothing that they can not handle together. Life with their men, love of their friends and family and knowing that there isn’t anything they can’t do with words of love, support and laughter.\n\nFields as M’Lynn seems to be the calmest character in the film but with the most intensity in her life. She goes with the southern flow and tries to see the good in all things but sometimes, there are moments where it all catches up. I love Fields in this role and when the story calls for it, she is free to let loose with emotion and sane insanity.\n\nParton as Truvy is straight forward and doesn’t take a lot of guff from anyone. This character loves good gossip, a salon full of women and is there when she is truly needed. Taking Annelle under her wing, it can be testing at times but no friendship is too small for Truvy. Hannah as Annelle comes in shy, gets a bit crazy, goes Sunday southern but one of the girls when it counts.\n\nMacLaine as Louisa is the typical a tad grumpy southern woman who just doesn’t have room in her life for nonsense. I always saw this character as not exactly wrong in her thinking and totally misunderstood outside her friendship group, okay, I just adore this character. Dukakis as Clairee is the town grande dame who knows everyone, everything and treats it all as her own little playground in a way. She is just cheeky when she needs and strong when her friends need her to be, just an absolutely delightful character and the friendship with Louisa is perfection.\n\nSkeritt as Drum cracks me up totally and loves his family, Sheppard as Drum is laid back and doesn’t like to rock the boat but clearly loves his wife, McDermott as Jackson is just trying to live the life he always has but now with a wife and a bit of legal status, and O’Connor hasn’t yet learned the phrase “happy wife happy life” but tries.\n\nOther cast include Bill McCutcheon as Owen Jenkins, Ann Wedgeworth as Fern Thornton, BiBi Besch as Belle Marmillion, Janine Turner as Nancy Beth, James Wlcek as Marshall Marmillion, Ronald Young as Drew, Tom Hodges as Louie, Norman Fletcher as Latcherie Sr., Jonathan Ward as Jonathan, Knowl Johnson as Tommy and Sam Shepard as Spud Jones.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases. The studios include Columbia Pictures, Screen Gems, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Stage 6 Films and Sony Picture Classics. To see what is coming to theaters and to home entertainment please visit http://www.sonypictures.com.\n\nBonus Materials include 4K Ultra HD Disc, Newly remastered in 4K resolution from the original camera negative, with Dolby Vision, and All-new Dolby Atmos audio + 5.1 + 2-channel surround. The Special Features are NEW: Steel Magnolias 1990 TV Pilot, Director’s Commentary, In Full Bloom: Remembering Steel Magnolias, 10 Deleted Scenes and Theatrical Trailer.\n\nSTEEL MAGNOLIAS is a film of love, family, friendships, loyalty and loss from start to finish. It is full of laughter, common southern sense with a heaping spoonful of no-nonsense. The cast brings Louisiana into the homes of everyone who has never experienced their world. Spending years in Alabama, I laughed through the film absolutely because none of it was a stretch. My parents actually lived next door to a real-life Truvy with her own salon in what was once a garage!\n\nThere isn’t anything in the film, actually, that doesn’t take me back to that small town living, small town friendships and every-body-knows-every-body’s-business feel. It is just a total delight from start to finished as the cast brings it home with just as much ease as the story begins.\n\nCurl up on the sofa with your favorite people, make sure there is Kleenex available and a cup of sweet tea and revisit or see this film for the first time. I can guarantee that STEEL MAGNOLIAS will be one you watch again and again.\n\nIn the end – the funny of the south that will bring you to tears!"
