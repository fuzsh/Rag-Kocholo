        "text": "Herbert Ross, a Broadway choreographer-turned-film director who brought serious dance into the Hollywood mainstream with movies like ''The Turning Point,'' translated five Neil Simon comedies to the screen and directed a pantheon of actresses in some of their most memorable roles, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan..\n\nHe had been in failing health for more than a year, family members said. The cause of death was heart failure, they said.\n\nAlthough Mr. Ross was probably best known for his film work, especially for a series of mainstream comedies he made with the producer Ray Stark in the 1970's and 80's, many felt that he actually had a greater impact as a choreographer in the 1950's and 60's, when he created ballets for American Ballet Theater and worked on some of the most celebrated Broadway musicals of the era.\n\nMr. Ross had several long-term creative relationships in his career. Besides Mr. Simon and Mr. Stark, he worked several times with Barbra Streisand and is credited with playing a significant role in her early career. But his most important creative partnership was with his first wife, Nora Kaye, one of the leading ballerinas of her day. She was his steadiest adviser and collaborator from their marriage in 1959 until her death in 1987.\n\nA tall, muscular man with chiseled features and a penetrating voice, Mr. Ross was a gently manipulative but rarely tyrannical director who knew how to get what he wanted and how to appeal to mass audiences.\n\nHe was never a flamboyant stylist and derided those who were. ''What's dangerous is when you get self-conscious about it,'' he once said. ''That's self-defeating, because it's the artlessness that you're after.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
