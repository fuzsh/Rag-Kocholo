        "text": "'The Good Doctor' presents a dozen short stories Â some funny, some touching, some a little bit of both\n\nBy Michael C. Moore Mmoore@Kitsapsun.Com 360-792-9218\n\nREVIEW\n\n'The Good Doctor'\n\nWho: The Roving Players\n\nWhat: Comedy by Neil Simon, based on short stories by Anton Chekhov\n\nWhere: Port Gamble Theater, 4839 NE View Drive, Port Gamble\n\nWhen: Through March 18; 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays\n\nTickets: $15 to $12\n\nInformation: 360-977-7135, portgambletheater.com\n\nNeil Simon's homage to Anton Chekhov is a mostly-fun mash-up of styles\n\nPORT GAMBLE — \"The Good Doctor\" is not your typical Neil Simon play. It's not as funny.\n\nBut to dismiss it thusly would be an oversimplication. \"The Good Doctor,\" currently receiving a rare production courtesy of the Roving Players at the Port Gamble Theater, is more than just Simon's trademark two-act burst of rapid-fire gags.\n\nInspired by Anton Chekhov's short stories, the collection of a dozen vignettes transcends mere Simonized Chekhov, coming off as more than just an update, one Borscht Belt to another. It's an homage, really, and some parts work better than others, I think because Simon often ratchets back on the jokes and focuses on Chekhov's keen sense of development — of characters, of situations, of ideas.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't funny. Several of the stories told by The Writer (Jim Wingren, in an ironman performance that also includes stepping into and out of several other characters) are full of fine, absurdist humor. At times, I got the impression that Simon might be taking as much of a cue from Joseph Heller or Monty Python as from Chekhov.\n\nThe segment that opens the second of the two acts — \"The Drowned Man\" — is a perfect example of the show's absurdist bent. Wingren's character, taking the air in some unidentified harbor district, is accosted by a man who offers to simulate a drowning, as light entertainment, for 3 rubles. At once repulsed and fascinated, Wingren's character calls for a policeman, who is shocked not by the offer, but by the price.\n\n\"Sixty kopecs is the most you should pay for a drowning,\" says the officer (Stu Smith in his best bit of the night). He goes on to spout increasingly ridiculous \"entertainment\" options available in the area, like two brothers who do a \"twin drowning\" for one ruble apiece.\n\nThe opening vignette, in which a young clerk (the consistently likable David LaMay) takes apology to new heights after accidentally sneezing on his boss (Smith), owes as much to the Pythons' \"Dirty Fork\" sketch as it does to Chekhov. \"I rue the day the protruderance formed itself on my face,\" LaMay whines of offending nose.\n\nOther pieces are more broad, almost slapstick, as in \"Surgery,\" in which a squeamish patient (Scott Snively, also the show's director) reluctantly places himself in the care of an inexperienced dental assistant (Wingren) wielding some \"This Old House\"-grade tools. In \"A Defenseless Creature,\" the nearly ubiquitous Wingren is a banker accosted by a not-so-helpless woman (Peggy Whelan) begging — shrilly, relentlessly, even threateningly — to have her husband's insurance claim filled.\n\n\"It is women like you who drive men like me to the condition of husbands like yours,\" Wingren spews in one of the show's most Simon-esque laugh lines.\n\nAs happens with both Simon and Chekhov, there are moments of great tenderness and humanity, too. When Wingren's overconfident playboy in \"The Seduction\" has to soul-search his way past a conquest (Lael Alecci), it's as moving as it is funny. The mostly musical \"Too Late for Happiness,\" with Smith and Whelan playing middle-aged single people trying to get together, and perhaps even harder to avoid it, is also sweet. \"The Audition,\" in which Alessi plays a young actress who wins over a director, is her strongest work of the night.\n\nThe segments aren't uniformly strong, but the acting is quite consistent, and the costumes martialed by Beth Ann Galloway — coupled with the antique formality of the theater itself — give the production a rich, atmospheric quality. There were a few stumbles, but that's easily understandable, given it was opening night and given the tremendous line load Snively places on his cast of six (who, all except Snively, who's in two segments, play at least three or four roles each).\n\nSnively, with his just-right comic touch, shines in both his pieces (he also appears with Smith in \"A Quiet War,\" in which two retired military men argue about everything — even what they should argue about). But it's Wingren — who first impressed me as an actor of both talent and stamina in 2005, when he shared the stage with J Kearsley in the Rovers' two-man drama \"Sleuth\" — who's given the most to do, and does the most with it. Leaning towards subtle, understated delivery (excepting moments like when his would-be dentist is chasing Snively's sextant all over the theater), he's consistently effective, even when he has to transform from one character to another, onstage, in a few seconds' time.\n\nEven though the opening-night performance was for an extremely small audience, there was no shortage of energy. In fact, in one or two instances, there might've been a little too much energy.\n\nIn all, though, there's much to recommend in the Rovers' \"Good Doctor.\" It's funny, yes, but more than that it's interesting to see the mash-up of styles that results from Simon's adaptation of Chekhov's source material.\n\nIf you like Simon, or Chekhov ... or Monty Python, for that matter ... go see the Doctor while he's in."
