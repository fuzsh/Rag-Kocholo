        "text": "Herbert Ross (May 13, 1927 in Brooklyn, New York - October 9, 2001 in New York City), also known as Herb Ross, was a prolific film director, producer, choreographer and actor from the 1950s to the 1990s.\n\nIn 1942 he had his stage debut as Third Witch with a touring company of Macbeth. In 1950 his choreography career began, with the American Ballet Theatre. His first film as a choreographer was in 1954 with Carmen Jones.\n\nIn 1968 he worked with Barbra Streisand as choreographer and director of musical numbers for the film Funny Girl. In 1975 he worked on the film adaptation of the Neil Simon play The Sunshine Boys, the first of several Neil Simon play adaptations he directed.\n\nHe had a huge hit with the film adaptation of Robert Harling's play Steel Magnolias, featuring Sally Field, Dolly Parton and Shirley MacLaine, in 1989. His last film was in 1995, when he produced and directed Boys on the Side, with performances from Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker and Drew Barrymore.\n\nHe was married twice, the first time to ballerina Nora Kaye, who died of cancer in 1987 at the age of 67, and secondly to Lee Radziwill, which marriage ended in divorce in 2001.\n\nHerbert Ross died at 74 in New York City of heart failure and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles."
