        "text": "No American playwright has been more successful or more popular than\n\nNeil Simon\n\n. The author of more than 35 plays and almost as many movies, he's the one playwright almost everyone knows.\n\nAppearing in his plays or films helped make the careers of dozens of well-known actors, including Robert Redford, Walter Matthau and Simon's second wife, Marsha Mason. Some even credit him with keeping an ailing Broadway alive between the mid-1960s, when he had four hit shows running at once, and the early 1990s, when \"Lost in Yonkers,\" which finally won him a Pulitzer Prize, ended its 780-performance run.\n\nImpressive as that run was, it doesn't even place in Simon's top five.\n\n\"Barefoot in the Park\" (1963) and \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (1983) are among the longest-running plays ever, with 1,530 performances each. \"Plaza Suite\" (1968; 1,097 performances), \"The Odd Couple\" (1965; 964) and \"Chapter Two\" (1977; 857) aren't far behind.\n\n\"The Sunshine Boys\"\n\nWhen: Opens 8 p.m. Saturday, continues 8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, through June 14\n\nWhere: Theater! Theatre!, 3430 S.E. Belmont St.\n\nTickets: $14-$28, 503-242-0080 or www.profiletheatre.org\n\nDespite his success, however, some critics have tended to view Simon, whose work is being featured by\n\nProfile Theatre\n\nthis season, as a second-tier playwright -- a master at creating humorous dialogue and funny situations but less adept at plotting and character development.\n\nAnyone who saw Profile's excellent production earlier this year of \"Biloxi Blues,\" one of Simon's most autobiographical plays, knows how wrong those critics are. \"The Sunshine Boys,\" Profile's last full Simon production this season, will offer further proof.\n\nYes, \"The Sunshine Boys\" is funny -- it's one of Simon's best comedies -- but it's also an affecting period piece about two aging vaudevillians facing the end of their careers.\n\nWhat many critics consistently missed, especially in Simon's early years, was the seriousness under the comedy in his work. As his longtime producer, Manny Azenberg, has put it, \"Darkness was never far away.\"\n\nThat darkness came increasingly to the fore in Simon's three Tony winners -- \"The Odd Couple,\" \"Biloxi Blues\" (1985) and \"Lost in Yonkers\" (1991), a play no one would have considered a comedy if anyone other than Simon had written it.\n\nAnd it was lurking already in \"The Sunshine Boys\" (1972), which addresses some of the issues of aging Simon himself is facing now.\n\nAt 81, the phenomenally prodigious Simon has slowed down. He spends most of his time with family or at the theater or watching his beloved Yankees. This fall, though, he will oversee the Broadway revival of two of his most popular plays -- \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and \"Broadway Bound.\" And recently he made time to answer some questions for us.\n\nQ: Let's start with \"The Sunshine Boys,\" since Profile will be staging it next. You rewrote \"The Odd Couple\" a few years ago; have you thought about rewriting \"The Sunshine Boys\"?\n\nA: No. I thought that \"The Odd Couple\" could be set at any time. These guys sitting around a table and playing poker forever and ever. Especially in New York. But \"The Sunshine Boys\" is about two men from a certain age who are near the end of their ability to do a show.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about your connection to vaudeville?\n\nI don't really have a connection to it because I never was in vaudeville -- that was before my time -- but I had seen it through movies and other things. When I was 18 or 19 and working with my brother, we used to meet these (old vaudevillians) at the ends of their careers, and they would want us to write for them. I'd say, \"Why do you need us? You're funnier than we would ever be.\" And they'd say, \"Well, we've done these pieces so many times, we need new stuff.\" So we'd write new stuff for them and they'd say, \"No, that's no good, that's new stuff.\"\n\nQ: It seems to me that you're really a language playwright, by which I mean that the language in your plays rather than the situations or actions or other character traits give them life.\n\nA: Well, to write characters I have to know them in some way, and the way I know characters is by how they talk. That tells me where they come from and where they live and how old they are. The guys in \"The Sunshine Boys\" don't speak like the guys in \"The Odd Couple.\" They come from different areas of the world and their lives are different, what they've been through. That's what's great about New York: You deal with so many different kinds of people.\n\nQ: Many of your characters tend to be somewhat stubborn, self-absorbed people forced in some way to recognize themselves; would that be a fair assessment?\n\nA: Sort of. I'd say all of the people I write about -- and this goes for playwriting altogether -- had better be in trouble. Otherwise, what's the play about?\n\nQ: Do you press them to an extreme to make that trouble?\n\nA: I don't try to push them to an extreme, because the extreme is there already. It's them. I'm never looking for humor, either. The humor just comes from the problems they're going through and how they deal with them.\n\nQ: So where does the humor come from? I mean, why aren't other playwrights able to write it the way you are?\n\nA: Well, I never asked other playwrights. ... For me, the humor just sort of slides in. It either comes out of my head or it doesn't. I know that sounds strange, but there's no other explanation for it. It's like if you were talking to a painter and you said, \"Where do you get the red from?\" What's he going to say to you? \"It's the right color to put there.\"\n\nQ: I suppose some of that has to do with how you grow up. Humor is a way some people deal with life.\n\nA: Yes. I think my humor comes from watching everything I've ever seen in my life. Mostly people speaking. Sitting in the room with my mother's family or my father's family and hearing how they talk. And saying to myself, \"This is weird.\" They don't make sense but they're able to articulate what they want to say. To me, it's humorous. And when I write it in a play, the audience gets it. They all have somebody in their family or know somebody that speaks that way.\n\nMy brother Danny was nine years older than me, and I looked up to him -- he was really God for me -- but Danny wrote differently. He thought differently. He was always looking for the laugh. And I would say, \"Danny, I don't think we should do this funny. This doesn't need any funny here.\"\n\nQ: Do you think humor comes from pain, mostly?\n\nA: Probably. There's a great deal of pain in humor. I think people want to hear it. Just laughing makes them feel better.\n\nQ: One thing that struck me while going back over your plays is that aging and an awareness of death were there from the beginning.\n\nA: That's because you can't avoid it. It's going to happen to all of us. When you're a kid you kind of laugh at it because it's nowhere near you, then suddenly you see your parents getting older and older and wonder what you're going to do with them, and then your brother -- because my brother is gone now. It's always there, so why not talk about it?\n\nQ: Are you working on anything new at this point?\n\nA: As of this morning. I have no idea where the play is going. I just started to write to see if I know how these people speak and what their problem is. I'll find out in about three or four pages whether it's not going anywhere, or it's a possibility, or I should go on and do it.\n\nQ: Can you tell me anything about it?\n\nA: I haven't even told my wife about it. I can't tell you.\n\nQ: OK, one last question: What, at its best, can theater do?\n\nA: I haven't a clue. That's a question that keeps blowing itself up.\n\nIt gets bigger and bigger, and I don't know. Theater is entertainment, really. You could call it art, if the play is artful, but I don't call it anything. It's just theater."
