        "text": "A poignant comedy about finding family through humor and heart.\n\nBurned-out Hollywood screenwriter Herb Tucker’s life is turned upside down when his girlfriend, Steffy, opens the door to discover an unexpected visitor. Libby, the 19-year-old daughter Herb hasn’t seen since she was three, has hitchhiked across the country hoping her estranged father will help fulfill her dreams of being in pictures. Although connection doesn’t come easily, perhaps this shakeup could provide a second chance for all of them. This spirited comedy is full of the trademark wit, humor and heart of Neil Simon, one of the American theater’s most beloved playwrights.\n\n“A very human comedy, a touching blend of laughter and sentiment.” Cue Magazine\n\n“It features some of Simon’s most charming writing.” Rex Reed, Daily News\n\nNotes: Contains mild swearing and conversations about sex. Patrons with specific content concerns should contact the Box Office with direct questions."
