        "text": "IN regional theater, an intended alternative to the commercial marketplace, one doesn't expect to come upon a hit of a decade ago by Neil Simon, whose 25th work is bound for Broadway in February.\n\nFor the George Street Playhouse, where an artistic mission is never so unequivocal that it cannot be adjusted to the requisites of popularity, the choice in this season's repertory of \"I Ought to Be in Pictures\" (Broadway, 1980; Hollywood, 1982) was handily justified.\n\nFor much interest attended the announcement that Cleavon Little would play Herb Tucker, the burned-out screenwriter. Here, George Street expected to score a double coup: luring a well-known actor to the prestige of nonprofit theater and advancing the cause of nontraditional casting.\n\nBut Mr. Little chose better remuneration -- a television series -- over prestige and the notion of the theater's artistic director and the play's director, Gregory S. Hurst, that the play itself needed reappraisal suddenly lost persuasive point.\n\nNow, Herb, the role that was problematic for Tony Curtis in the pre-Broadway production in Los Angeles but a success for Ron Leibman in New York and Walter Matthau on screen, is being played by John P. Connolly, who, drearily, concedes to the character's initial weakness and charmlessness. When the writing allows, as in a final telephone scene that is splendidly acted, Mr. Connolly gets a grip on the essence of the fearful, unattached man who's fixated on the late 1950's.\n\nThe real surprise here is Suzzanne Douglas as Steffy, Herb's lover, who has a smart not just a snappy retort for his every defensively heartless and glib one. It's not just that it falls to Ms. Douglas, a black actress in a traditionally white role, and an uninteresting, formulaic one at that, to prove the possibilities of \"colorblind\" casting. It's that Ms. Douglas turns the character from an appendage into a play's organic necessity -- and an ultimatum into an offer no sensible man could refuse, as Steffy battles to get a commitment from Herb. Ms. Douglas gives a performance of warmth and allure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
