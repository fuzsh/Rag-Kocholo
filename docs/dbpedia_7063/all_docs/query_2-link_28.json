        "text": "\"I Ought To Be In Pictures,\" written by Neil Simon, is a family story about love and redemption. Herb Tucker, a middle-aged screenwriter living in West Hollywood, is on a downslide in his profession and stuck in neutral in his personal life. He has writer's block and he keeps his lovely girlfriend, Steffy, at arm's length. Herb is teetering and a small shove is all that is needed to put him over the edge.\n\nHis life is upended when his 19-year-old daughter, Libby, shows up at his door asking for his help to get into the motion picture business. He hasn't seen or been in contact with Libby since she was 3 years old when he walked out on his family and never looked back.\n\nLibby is a straight-talking, optimistic young woman who hasn't had any acting experience except for an understudy part in a summer school play that had a two-day run. Libby is not really there to become an actress. She is there to develop a relationship with her father and this delightfully witty and heart-felt show examines the development of this father-daughter relationship.\n\nAct I is all about the characters learning about each other and examining their needs. Herb is uncomfortable with his \"new\" daughter as she resolutely questions him about his actions. She is not there to point a finger, but to understand why he deserted them. Steffy acts as the voice of reason as she points out to Herb what he is missing and embraces Libby.\n\nAct II is all about the relationship that is developing between father and daughter. Herb is more comfortable with Libby and is enjoying his daughter. He is, in fact, revelling in this newfound relationship. Ultimately, Herb, Libby and Steffy find stasis in their lives.\n\nAlthough the subject matter is serious, the dialogue is quick, witty and funny in typical Neil Simon fashion. His depiction of the relationships in this show are not tragic but are, instead, something to be celebrated. Simon takes an unhappy, unsatisfied man and makes him whole through love.\n\nThis show is perfect for an intimate black box theater and this production is charming and moving.\n\nMichael Walsh, as Herb Tucker, brings a warmth to a character that you should probably not like very much. He is the ultimate boy who won't grow up and Walsh makes him likable.\n\nHannah Wagner as Libby Tucker is the perfect 19-year-old, sure of her opinions and living in a bit of a dream world where she hides her vulnerability. She has conversations with her dead grandmother who advises her and impels her to ask Herb the tough questions.\n\nDonna Phofolos is charming as Steffy Blondell. She is the voice of reason and acts as a bridge between Father and Daughter.\n\nDirector Danielle Howard wondered in program notes about whether the 1980s setting would seem outdated. Some of the references may not be understood by a younger audience, but the show is all about love and that never changes. Howard has directed a show that is quick, witty and poignant. Howard has helped the actors to develop their characters so that we care about them and understand them.\n\nThe set is fairly simple, a rather rundown room in a bungalow in West Hollywood. Stephanie Voss' set design added to the development of the show especially in the second act. Herb and Libby's developing relationship is mirrored on the set with the changes that Libby has made changing the drab bachelor pad into a cozy home.\n\nLighting by Michael Turner was on point using the stage to its best advantage indicating other areas of action outside of the main room.\n\nCostume design by Kayla Cortina is well done with a tip of the hat to the 1980s especially in Steffy's look.\n\nAct One's \"I Ought To Be in Pictures\" is a show that is entertaining and well done. You leave the theater feeling happy and hopeful. Take time out of the tumult of the modern world and step back into the 1980s with this group. You will be glad you did.\n\nGo & Do\n\nWhat: Act One Festival presents \"I Oughta Be In Pictures\"\n\nWhen: Through Sept. 1, check actonenh.org for showtimes\n\nWhere: West End Studio Theater, Islington St., Portsmouth\n\nTickets: $20, general admission; $18, seniors and students\n\nMore info: Call (603) 300-2986 or visit www.actonenh.org"
