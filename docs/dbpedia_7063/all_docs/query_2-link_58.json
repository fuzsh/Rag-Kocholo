        "text": "By Neil Simon\n\nDirected by Jessica Stone\n\nCRITIC'S CHOICE\n\n\"A charming ode to the magic of love! The radiant \"Halt and Catch Fire\" TV star Kerry Bishé effortlessly steals the show. She's adoring, clever and playful. Paul is amiably played by \"GLOW\" TV star Chris Lowell, who does a slow burn throughout until he hilariously erupts.\" —The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nFresh off a honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel, free-spirited Corie and her buttoned-down husband Paul find themselves struggling to adjust to married life in their run-down New York walk-up. Throw in a loopy meddling mother, an eccentric Bohemian upstairs neighbor, and a double date that goes disastrously wrong, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for laughter. This summer, director Jessica Stone (Ken Ludwig’s Robin Hood, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike) returns to the Globe to extend our decades-long relationship with giant comic playwright Neil Simon with this fresh and hilarious new look at his “bubbling, rib-tickling comedy” (The New York Times).\n\nProduction Sponsors\n\nTerry Atkinson\n\nPeter Cooper\n\nPam Farr and Buford Alexander\n\nDebra Turner\n\nArtist Sponsor for Director Jessica Stone\n\nLeonard Hirsch\n\nArtist Sponsor for Kerry Bishé and Chris Lowell\n\nSandra and Arthur Levinson\n\nRunning time: Two hours and twenty minutes.
