        "text": "“No playwright in Broadway’s long and raucous history has so dominated the boulevard as the softly astringent Simon,” wrote John Lahr in The New Yorker in 2010. “For almost half a century, his comedies have offered light at the end of whatever dark tunnel America has found itself in.”\n\nSimon established his reputation writing some of Broadway’s most successful comedies, including Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, and Plaza Suite. Many of his later plays explored darker themes, as those found in Biloxi Blues, Broadway Bound and Lost in Yonkers.\n\nAmong a host of leading actors who appeared in Simon plays and musicals on Broadway are Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Robert Redford, Walter Matthau, George C. Scott, Maureen Stapleton, Christopher Plummer, Peter Falk, Lee Grant, Tammy Grimes, George Grizzard, Jack Weston, Bernadette Peters, Martin Short, Linda Lavin, Gwen Verdon and Art Carney.\n\nThe directors include Mike Nichols, Gene Saks, Bob Fosse, Robert Moore, Joe Mantello, Jerry Zaks, Herbert Ross, John Rando, and Michael Bennett.\n\nDuring his long-running career, it was not unusual for Simon to have two Broadway shows running concurrently, sometimes three, and once, in 1966, he had four (Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Sweet Charity and The Star Spangled Girl). His plays have been translated into dozens of languages and are produced around the world.\n\nMarvin Neil Simon was born in the Bronx, New York, on July 4, 1927, to Irving Simon, a salesman in the garment district, and Mamie Levy Simon, a saleslady at Gimbel’s department store. He had one brother, Danny Simon, eight years his senior. He grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. Simon studied at NYU and the University of Denver while serving in the U.S. Army Air Force Reserve.\n\nHe began his career in the early 1950s, working as a team with his older brother, Danny, writing scripts for radio and television shows, including The Garry Moore Show. Neil and Danny Simon were hired to join Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and others as writers for Sid Caesar’s legendary television series, Your Show of Shows, and its successor, Caesar’s Hour. On his own, Neil Simon wrote more than a dozen episodes of The Phil Silvers Show (Sgt. Bilko).\n\nAfter 10 years in television, Simon turned his attention to writing for the stage. His first Broadway show was a comedy, Come Blow Your Horn (1961), directed by Stanley Prager.

Both shows were directed by Mike Nichols. Simon won the 1965 Best Author Tony Award for The Odd Couple.\n\nSimon wrote the book for the Cy Coleman/Dorothy Fields musical, Sweet Charity (1966), starring Gwen Verdon, directed by Bob Fosse.
