And that is a shame, for they overflow with humor and are spot-on about the hilarious vagaries of urban life. Yes, they are products of a specific era, and as such are now vintage, but charmingly so.\n\nMelbourne Civic Theatre’s Peg Girard, a director who follows her own drummer, selected a Simon period piece to lift the spirits of her audiences this summer. Girard knows her Simon, since the first play she directed for MCT was “I Ought to be in Pictures.” Last year she presented pandemic-tired audiences with “The Prisoner of Second Avenue,” a very identifiable Simon character, given the times.\n\nComic hijinks on stage: 'Forum' opens in Titusville, 'Missing Corpse' at Surfside\n\nHappening in Brevard County: Concerts, exhibits, baking class set for Aug. 6-12\n\n“I don’t pay much attention to whatever is trendy among other community theaters nationwide, but Mr. Simon’s plays have been consistently popular with MCT’s audiences throughout my entire tenure,” said Girard.\n\n“He may have suffered some backlash late in his career from those resentful of his popularity, but since his passing has been re-embraced in the odd American custom of revering artists by virtue of their being dead.”\n\n“Barefoot in the Park” premiered on Broadway in 1963. Directed by the legendary Mike Nichols, the play starred Elizabeth Ashley and Robert Redford in his pre-Sundance Kid days. An instant success, “Barefoot” ran for 1,530 performances, making it Simon’s longest-running play and the tenth longest-running non-musical in Broadway history.\n\n“Barefoot is one of his (Simon’s) earliest success, and showcases the traits for which he would become famous---the one-liners, the family conflict, the New York sensibility,” explained Girard.\n\nThe MCT production is faithful to Simon’s original story line of Corie and Paul, a proto-Dharma and Greg, as they maneuver married life in their New York walk-up. Flower child Corie believes everything will work out fine, while uptight Paul is not so sure, but would love to be able to let his hair down and walk “barefoot in the park.”\n\nMCT’s refreshing version of the classic stars Mary Carson Barnette as Corie and Anthony DeTrano as Paul, with support from Victoria Smith as Ethel Banks, Dana Blanchard as Victor Velasco and Anthony Santiago as Harry Pepper, the phone repairman.\n\nThe charms of “Barefoot in the Park” lie in its lack of pretense of being anything other than a romantic comedy about two very different individuals trying to make a go of it as a couple. Its nostalgic glow about what love and marriage was all about in the early 1960s - before the sexual revolution - is also endearingly dated.\n\nFor folks of a certain age, “Barefoot in the Park” basks in the warm glow of memory. For a younger crowd, it’s a whole new ballgame.\n\n“There are whole generations who have no history with it,” said Girard. “They are discovering it for the first time.”\n\nIn other news: Meg's reopens, Uno Pizzeria closes, plus new places to try\n\nIf you go\n\n'Barefoot in the Park'\n\nWhere: Melbourne Civic Theatre, 817 E.
