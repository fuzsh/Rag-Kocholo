        "text": "The choreographer and Broadway director, turned moviemaker, Herbert Ross, who has died of heart failure aged 74, became one of the most successful, yet oddly anonymous, producer-directors in the history of Hollywood.\n\nIt is likely that even the least frequent of filmgoers will have seen - and enjoyed - some of his films, as diverse as Play It Again, Sam (1972), Funny Lady (1975), The Turning Point (1977), Footloose (1984) and Steel Magnolias (1989), among many others.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Ross began his career as a teenage actor and dancer in the 1940s, but by his late 20s he had enjoyed success as the director of House Of Flowers on Broadway (1954) and that same year worked, uncredited, as choreographer on Otto Preminger's ambitious musical drama Carmen Jones.\n\nFrom this period, he divided his time between the stage and cinema, although in later years he moved increasingly to the latter, becoming closely associated with producer Ray Stark and writer Neil Simon, carving out a niche as an efficient director of high-gloss, entertainment films.\n\nThere were flops along the way, although he enjoyed popular success at the expense of critical regard; his journeyman status was encapsulated by one high-minded commentator who wrote: \"Few of his films are essential, but many of them have been popular, and a few can even be considered good.\"\n\nHis Broadway success established, he went on to other work, becoming a resident choreographer at the American Ballet School, and in 1960 directed Finian's Rainbow, the musical that was later to mark Francis Coppola's studio-film debut. Ross continued as a choreographer on stage hits, including On A Clear Day You Can See Forever, and on films, in cluding Inside Daisy Clover (1965) and Doctor Dolittle (1967).\n\nHis talent also enlivened two British musicals starring Cliff Richard, The Young Ones and Summer Holiday, turning them into something that could hold a dim candle to their American counterparts. In The Young Ones (1961), when amateurs took on a full-scale production, there are nods towards movies such as Babes On Broadway and Singin' In The Rain, with one genuinely ebullient dance sequence.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he turned to film directing, and his debut came with the British-based Goodbye Mr Chips (1969). A critical disaster, it only achieved modest commercial success, thanks to lacklustre tunes, second-rung casting and an inordinate running time.\n\nHis next movie was the transfer of a stage hit, The Owl And The Pussycat, considered mildly controversial and made into a star vehicle for Barbra Streisand. His boundless dedi cation to duty was illustrated by having worked with her as choreographer on Funny Girl and a willingness to direct the sequel, where Streisand again played Fanny Brice. In Funny Lady (1975), he steered her towards an Oscar as best actress.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ross directed two films that became cult successes. Woody Allen adapted his own theatrical success, Play It Again, Sam, for the screen, and had the good sense not to direct it after the dismal Bananas. He starred as a neurotic critic finding solace in the shape of Diane Keaton and the shadow of Humphrey Bogart, and Ross kept the whimsy on an even keel. His straightforward talent also stopped The Last Of Sheila (1973) from tipping into unwatchable over-indulgence, and he turned the high-camp screenplay by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins into a watchable satire on fame and Hollywood.\n\nIn the mid-70s he came into contact with Neil Simon's work, successfully di recting The Sunshine Boys (1975), before making the over-clever spoof about Sherlock Holmes, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976). By now Ross was often his own producer and on his next - and most famous work - he was successfully joined by his wife, Norma Kaye, a former choreographer and ballet dancer.\n\nThe result was The Turning Point (1977), with its inbuilt homage to his old employers, the American Ballet Theatre, in the story of an ageing dancer who visits a former rival, retired to domesticity. The soap-opera story ensured an audience and the presence of Mikhail Baryshnikov added lustre. Sadly for Ross and Kaye, the film - nominated for 10 Oscars - failed to win anything at the 1977 academy award ceremony.\n\nProducer Stark offered immediate comfort with films based on Neil Simon scripts. The Goodbye Girl featured a memorable performance by Richard Dreyfuss and some great lines, while the more fragmented California Suite (1978) also had some neat swipes at the expense of the Oscars, given added frisson by the events of the previous year.\n\nA couple of years later, Nijinsky - originally a Ken Russell project - came Ross's way, but he seemed out of his depth with the weakly scripted story of the dancer and his jilted lover, Sergei Diaghilev. Nor was he too successful in transferring Dennis Potter's television original Pennies From Heaven to the big screen (1981). He was in more comfortable territory with Neil Simon's amiable comedy I Ought To Be In Pictures (1982), which he had successfully directed on stage two years before.\n\nNudging 60, Ross had a surprise commercial success with Footloose (1984), a youthful rock musical, and three years later another hit with the Michael J Fox wish-fulfilment movie, The Secret Of My Success. He was less fortunate with the deservedly little-seen Dancers, also 1987; in the same year Nora Kaye died of cancer. A year later he married Jackie Kennedy's sister, Lee Bouvier Radziwill, whom he divorced earlier this year.\n\nIn 1989 he returned to directing with Steel Magnolias, adapted by Robert Harling from his stage success and offering succulent roles for several of Hollywood's leading ladies of a certain age. The film enjoyed considerable commercial and critical acclaim, as did My Blue Heaven (1990). But its successors - all of which he also produced - True Colors (1991), Undercover Blues (1993) and Boys On The Side (1995) were less well received. Proving, perhaps, that light, soft-centred entertainment was less in demand in the special-effects dominated movies of the 1990s."
