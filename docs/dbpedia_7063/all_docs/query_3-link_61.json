        "text": "On a datalounge recommendation, I purchased 'In Her Sister's Shadow: An intimate Biography of Lee Radziwell'.\n\nThere are more hilarious take downs of airhead, bitchy Lee than you can shake a stick at, but this one anecdote was a standout.\n\nHere goes. Consider what a legendary cunt Julia Roberts is. Now consider how cunty you'd have to act like to make that one cry at her own premiere.\n\nLee Radziwell IS that cunt.\n\nLee ploughed through her hefty divorce settlements from that Polish minor 'Prince' she married and was broke and looking around for a rich husband in the eighties. She selected gay Herbert Ross, then earning around $2 million a picture.\n\nRoss' friends and the cast of Steel Magnolia's hated Lee. Shirley McLaine did a bitchy impression of her on the set to make the other gals laugh.\n\nAt the London premiere, which was a Royal Command Performance, meaning Princess Di and Charles were to attend, Ross was told the score by Columbia Pictures : there's strict protocol, key talent line up in one row, their spouses /plus one's stand behind them in a second row. The same for the seating of the screening: stars, Ross and royalty only in the front row.\n\nWell, Lee was displeased about this, feeling she had the right to a front row place though she had nothing to do with the production at all.\n\n'Now , I was organising this' says Steve Klain, the Columbia Pictures employee in charge of the event. 'and going into this we were told that Lee was very, very difficult and that she wanted to be known as Princess (Lee still hadn't worked out that the Polish title meant nothing, and the marriage that conferred it upon her had long since ended), so she was always 'Radziwell' and never 'Ross' though she was Herbert's wife now. '\n\nRoss refused to stand in the front line, because protocol dictated that Lee was not allowed in that line next to him. 'Herb, you understand this is only for people connected with the production, and Lee will be standing right behind you'. He said 'It's not going to happen'. Klain told Ray Stark, longtime collaborator of Ross and producer of Magnolias. 'That bitch!' he said. Stark had sharp words with Ross, who relented.\n\nThe night of the premiere, Lee stood in the second line where she belonged. She and Ross then moved into the theatre, where they were told by Klain 'same deal, Herb up front, Lee you are right behind him'. But Lee made a beeline for the front row and sat herself next to Ross. On her other side was an empty seat, then Prince Charles.\n\nAccording to Edward Shugrue, president of Tri-Star distribution, the seat next to Charles was for Olympia Dukakis, and the one next to that, occupied by Lee, was for Julia Roberts.\n\nWhen Columbia executives spotted Lee, they asked her to move. 'She pretended she didn't hear anyone and stared straight ahead and held firm' says Klain. Then Roberts and Dukakis came down the aisle. Julia whispered to Lee that she was sitting in her seat. Lee would not move. Roberts repeated herself, and Lee ignored her. In desperation, Julia sought the assistance of others. Several people came down the aisle and implored Lee to vacate Julia's seat. One of them was Ray Stark, who tapped her on the shoulder and spoke to her softly. Lee still would not move. Never one to mince words, Stark whispered in her ear 'Lee, you are a cunt'.\n\nIn the meantime, Charles and Diana kept hearing 'wrong seat!' in spite of the whispering. As a result, Diana got up, and Charles followed. They thought THEY were in the wrong seats. An embarrassing flurry followed as the royal couple tried to relocate. Pandemonium broke about among the Columbia officials. A chain reaction was touched off in the front row with everyone but Lee rising and looking for guidance on where to sit. When it all settled down, stars Roberts and Dukakis were displaced to the second row. Lee eventually got up from Roberts seat - only to sit herself next to Prince Charles in the front row.\n\nRoberts was visibly shaken, with tears welling in her eyes. 'It was shameful. Horrendous.' says Klain.\n\nThere is quite a lot more in the book about Steel Magnolias.\n\nIncluding this. One day, Rex Reed, film critic and star of At The Movies, showed up in Natchitoches on assignment from a magasine to write about the making of the film. Banned from the set by Herb Ross, he hung around the town to seek out his story.\n\n'Everyone connected with that movie was more than happy to give me unflattering Lee Radziwell stories' says Reed. 'She behaved like an impossible, self-centred, very temperamental bitch who made no attempt to even try and be diplomatic with the little people of that town, and no one on the set would have anything to do with her, either. they all hated her there - just hated her! she alienated so many people that they were calling me up to give me stories, and when Premiere magazine fact-checkers called them to verify everything, my sources gave them even more material'\n\n'It was unbelievable what was going on. First off, she insisted on the best rental house for herself. Then she had furniture moved out as it was not aesthetically pleasing to her - this wasn't even her house. She made union carpenters come over from the set to cover up a skylight in the bedroom. She ordered the production to ship in a British Raleigh bicycle for her by Fed Ex from Baton Rouge. She made Herb Ross bring home the imported caviar from the set for themselves (at $135 for a tiny jar) and then denied that they had taken it.\n\nShirley McLaine and I were getting together every night. She was just devastated that this woman was dominating his life and already spending all his money faster than he could earn it. '\n\nTo the poster who doubts Ross was gay : he lived with John Ward, dancer turned art director, in an openly gay relationship for 13 years in the 1940's and 50's.\n\nKaren Lerner was at the Herb and Lee wedding dinner hosted by Jackie i her library. 'Isn't he homosexual?' Jackie asked. Lerner replied' Well i never heard he wasn't'.\n\nSometimes Ross would queen out. Architect and decorator Tony Hail was at a dinner at which 'everything was fine until Herbert fell apart in the middle of it. He had a couple of drinks and suddently his hands were waving all over the place and he was back to his old self, the bisexual part . It was dismaying to see because it was so obvious. I was embarrassed for Lee that here was this fellow whom she married, her bridegroom, who was obviously a homosexual. But i have to say, Lee seemed enormously happy. She was hard up, you know, for so long'.\n\nGore Vidal got drunk at a dinner Jackie threw for Lee at the White House and Bobby and another guy had to roughly remove him. That is what upset the apple cart there.\n\nJackie left Lee nothing in her will. Not a single trinket. She provided for her niece and nephew.\n\nGore Vidal was wrong to say that Jackie did nothing for anyone except her kids. She was a good aunt. Lee was a horrible mother, absent from her children's lives for much of their upbringing, by nannies. She spent much of the sixties on yachts and on holiday, shopping and having affairs- without Tina and Anthony. Tina's friends considered her withdrawn and neglected. Lee bullied her for her lack of interest in her appearance, criticising her weight and her skin.\n\nLee had post-natal depression after Tina was born premature. She blamed Stanislaw Radziwell and refused to ever have sex with him again, though she stayed marred to him for years later, for the 'title' and so she could drain him financially. She threw him out of the master bedroom and he was relegated to a box room, in which she installed a bed.\n\nWhen Lee's boozing got out of control in the seventies (and she would take Valium for the hangovers) Tina would have to care for her in the NYC apartment. Lee was so nasty to Tina that she ran away to aunt Jackie. She lived at Jackie's place (a few blocks from Lee's) for months. Lee was very bitter about that.\n\nWhen Anthony got married, Lee absurdly sent out invitations to members of the European royal families, requesting their presence at the celebration of the wedding of Prince Radziwell. She was very irritated that none of them replied.\n\nMore evidence of Lee RAHSHI-will's cuntitude for the datalounge jury, again from the treasure trove that is, Diana DuBois's 'Intimate Biography'.\n\nLee's hotstuff lover Peter Beard told his pal Steve Aronson ' she will go anywhere to make a fool out of herself. When she is around fancy city people she graduates from (being genuine) to manipulation and cunning'.\n\nLee and Peter's friend Jay Mellon once spotted a manuscript lying around Aronson's place. Steve was editing the memoirs of interior designer Billy Baldwin and Jay read it. One chapter was called 'La Princesse Manquée' and although Lee was not named, Jay recognised her immediately.\n\nThe first part was to be called 'Stars in My Crown' about clients he liked, such as Cole Porter and the second 'Thorns in My Side' was about the most appalling clients he had ever encountered. The awful clients' identities were thinly disguised. 'Unfinished Symphony' was obviously Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAronson recalls 'the chapter about Lee was written in piss and vinegar, and it was devastating' .\n\nBaldwin revealed how Lee had come to his office one day to discuss the redecoration of her NYC apartment. Together, they went round to fabric and furniture sources and she took notes. then she never hired him, but instead proceeded to contact all his sources he had introduced her to, getting everything she wanted at a big discount by using her celebrity status as Jackie's sister.\n\nBaldwin, at that time long considered the Dean of Decoration, told Aronson flatly that nothing like that had ever happened to him before in the course of his long career. he said he felt he had been plagiarised and he considered her behavior reprehensible and practically actionable.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay Mellon told Lee about Billy's chapter. A short while later, Steve Aronson found himself at a small dinner party seated across from Lee. She behaved cordially towards him in front of other guests but at the end of the dinner he found himself bringing up the rear step with her as they all exited for the living room.\n\nAronson: 'Lee turned suddenly and took my hand and her hand became a claw, her fingers became talons, and she hissed 'You tell that little fag ' - this from the bosom friend of Truman Capote and Rudolf Nureyev!- ' that if that chapter ever appears in print, I am going to sue the shit aout of him!'. I left the 'fag' part out when I relayed her threat to Billy. Even so, his reply was that she was such an awful person, with such a history of making trouble for people, that it would be worth it to scrap the chapter just so he would never have t think of her again'.\n\nShe was a cunt to her own children, R191. She didn't like children. She had them to ensure she got Stanislaw Radziwell's money. And his Francis Bacon painting, which she had to sell in the seventies when she blew through the divorce settlement.\n\nAnd she was cruel to people who had been loyal to her. Maybe he should have known better, but here is how she treated Truman Capote, who she used to try and start an acting career, despite having no talent for acting at all.\n\nGore Vidal sued Capote over an interview with Liz Smith that Capote did, in which he told Lee's story that Vidal had been removed from the White House after getting drunk and into a fight with Bobby Kennedy in 1961 (he was never invited back).\n\nVidal claimed libel damages. Capote said Lee would vouch the story was true, as he had got it from her. Lee was furious and denied she said any such thing. (She may indeed have embellished the story to Truman. Gore Vidal and others, including George Plimpton, say Vidal left of his own accord though do not deny Vidal was drunk and argued with Bobby). Truman therefore refrained from deposing Lee out of loyalty to her. she received a subpoena however, and in reply, she denied ever having said anything about Vidal being kicked out of the dinner.\n\nThis ended the friendship. Truman was devastated that Lee would not back him in the legal dispute.\n\nLee told Newton Cope ' Oh am I ever in hot water! The little worm is threatening to sue me'. Capote had to pay $80,000 in legal costs. He asked Liz Smith to call Lee, begging her to testify that she was the source of the embellished Vidal story. 'No', Lee repeated to Smith. 'The notoriety of it is too much. I am tired of Truman riding on my coat tails to fame.And Liz, what difference does it make? They are just a couple of fags.' Smith argued for Truman, for his long friendship with Lee. But she was stunned by Lee's scorn.\n\nTruman was besides himself with anxiety over the lawsuit as he did not have the money to pay Vidal damages. Smith passed on Lee's comments. When Truman heard Lee had called him 'just a fag' he went into a tailspin. 'RODE ON HER COAT TAILS?' he screamed. 'IS SHE KIDDING?'.\n\nCapote called Andy Warhol, who said Truman was so mad 'it was scary'. 'He said ' If I told you all the things she's said about you, Andy'. I said 'I don't care. I've always known what kind of a person she was'.\n\nWorked at Andre Oliver from '78-'84. It was an extraordinary men's store- nothing like it before or since in NYC to my knowledge, and I have lived in NYC all my life. Someone asked if Barbra Streisand ever came int- no- nor Elizabeth Taylor :) But year, lots of celebrities and the usual society types and tycoons of the time were in a lot.\n\nSo yeah I was quite the little \"shop whatever\", except that I am hardly little. It was load of fun at the time, but in time I went on to another much more serious career. I ran into Amanda Burden not long ago at a tennis club in NYC. At the time she was married to Steve Ross (Warner). She of course has become a great city planner (for not $) and remains one of the nicest classiest women I ever met- mother Babe Paley, step father Bill Paley (one of the first customers of the store. Anyway she said to me at one point- \"I guess we both grew up\". So nice and yes we both did in our own ways.\n\nThose were unique times, the late 70s until HIV tore it all apart in the early 80s. The gay male Manhattan world of decadence, chic, over the top creativity all came to an end in the most horrible way. Most of the sales staff and Andre Oliver are deceased, of HIV.\n\nR89- no.\n\nLee decided she wanted to be a actress in the sixties and she wanted to star, rather than work her way up. Truman Capote helped get her the role of Tracy Lord in a production of The Philadelphia Story at a playhouse in Chicago. The production was a disaster, due to Lee's lack of training and lack of talent. 'A Star is Not Born' was one review headline.\n\nUndeterred, Lee was delighted when Capote pitched a Lee vehicle to producers David Susskind and Alan Shayne.\n\nTruman adapted Laura, Otto Preminger's celebrated film noir. It was to be a two-hour Movie of the Week special for ABC and London Television. Rehearsals and taping were to take place in London. Veteran actors such as George Sanders and Farley Granger were cast to cosset the novice leading lady. But they only succeeded in highlighting her glaring inadequacies.\n\n'The whole situation was bad' said Alan Shayne.\n\nLee's scenes were cut to the bone. But she was so terrible that the producers wanted to replace her. Susskind: 'what really angered me was Lee's attitude. she was constantly late for rehearsal because of parties at her home. in the final weeks of rehearsal, she didn't know her lines, or her cues, or where to enter or exit.'\n\nSusskind had connections to the Kennedys so was uncomfortable with firing Lee. Instead he instructed director John Moxey to give her hell, so she would quit.\n\nLee complained to Capote and Cecil Beaton about Moxey, but refused to leave.\n\nSusskind chopped Lee's scenes into many very brief ones, knowing Lee could not sustain any display of emotion. 'We had to do as many as thirty takes in some instances, and the only way to get it right was to focus the camera on anything but Lee'.\n\nSusskind gave a preview party in NYC. Ingrid Bergman and Johnny Carson walked out. 'Johnny was offended by the command of the rich and famous' . Said Capote ' It had more to do with his professionalism. He resented the idea that a young lady like that , who was not a professional actress, could star in an expensive production like that'. 'And justifiably so, ' said Susskind."
