        "text": "You Ought to Be in Pictures is a 1940 Looney Tunes short directed by I. Freleng.\n\nTitle[]\n\nThe title comes from the popular 1934 song \"You Oughta Be in Pictures\" by Dana Suesse and Edward Heyman.\n\nPlot[]\n\nDaffy wants to be the top star in the studio. To this end, he persuades Porky to resign from the Schlesinger studios to pursue a career in feature films as Bette Davis' leading man. Porky goes to Leon Schlesinger and asks to have his contract torn up. Schlesinger reluctantly agrees, and wishes Porky the best of luck. \"He'll be back!\" chuckles Schlesinger after Porky is out of earshot.\n\nPorky spends the rest of the film trying to get into the lots and sets of an unnamed studio, with little success. After several failures, from convincing the security guard to let him in to dressing up as Oliver Hardy to gain access, until the guard gave chase, and inadvertently interrupting the shooting of a ballet film, he decides to see if Schlesinger will take him back. He returns to Schlesinger's office after frantically dodging his cartooned car in and out of \"actual\" Los Angeles traffic, only to see Daffy doing a wild audition to become the new star of Warner Bros. cartoons, openly disparaging Porky. Porky then takes Daffy with him to another room, where he beats Daffy up. After this, he hurriedly runs into Schlesinger's office to beg for his job back. Schlesinger, laughing heartily and saying \"I knew you'd be back!\", reveals that he didn't really rip up Porky's contract, and happily tells him to get back to work. Porky gladly thanks him and runs back into the animation paper that he was in when the short started. Daffy, still not quite having learned his lesson after being beaten by Porky, again attempts to persuade Porky to resign and work with Greta Garbo, only to get splattered with a tomato.\n\nCaricatures[]\n\nOliver Hardy\n\nAvailability[]\n\nStreaming[]\n\nGoofs[]\n\nA shadow of a camera appears on the wall while Porky Pig is beating up Daffy Duck for revenge, off-screen, just after returning to the Warner Bros' animation studio and asks Leon Schlesinger for his contract.\n\nOnly in the computer-colorized version: An animator originally draws Porky Pig in black-and-white. In the next scene after the Termite Terrace employees rush out of the studio for lunch, Porky appears in color, resulting in a plot-hole as to who among the crew colored him at the last minute or how Porky got colorized.\n\nNotes[]\n\nIn a real-life parallel of the storyline, the short was Friz Freleng's first since returning to Schlesinger after a stint as a director at MGM's cartoon division. In fact, the cartoon homages Freleng's experience in moving to MGM.\n\nThis is also the first Looney Tunes short directed by Freleng since \"Buddy's Trolley Troubles\" in 1934.\n\nMany staff members have cameos in this short:\n\nLeon Schlesinger — appears as himself\n\nChuck Jones — one of the crowd rushing out during the lunch break\n\nMichael Maltese — the studio security guard\n\nBob Clampett — another one of the Termite Terrace employees rushing frantically off to lunch\n\nGerry Chiniquy — studio director calling for quiet\n\nHenry Binder & Paul Marin stagehands also calling for quiet. Binder is also the stagehand throwing Porky off the set\n\nTo keep the short on-budget, relatively few special effects were used to marry the animation and live action. Where possible, the crew simply took still pictures of the office background and had them enlarged and placed directly on the animation stand.\n\nBecause the animation unit did not have access to location sound recording equipment, all of the live-action footage was shot silent. The voices had to be dubbed in later (which is why most of them were dubbed by Mel Blanc, except Leon Schlesinger who dubbed his own voice).\n\nPorky breaks the fourth wall by saying he has a good job being in cartoons.\n\nClocking in at a total run-time of 9 minutes 45 seconds, this is one of the longest-running Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts ever produced. When this cartoon was released on the short-lived Golden Jubilee video collection \"Porky Pig's Screwball Comedies\", due to the 1 hour VHS space restrictions at the time, this cartoon was time-compressed (sped-up) to be twice as fast as normal, and two other Porky Pig shorts in this tape which clock at the usual run-time of 6–7 minutes, \"The Wearing of the Grin\" and \"Dough for the Do-Do\", were also time-compressed the same way to fit in the VHS tape's space restrictions for this reason.\n\nAs it was made in black-and-white, the short appeared only occasionally on television. In 1995, the film was computer-colorized and became a regular part of the Cartoon Network rotation.\n\nIt was shown in black and white on Cartoon Network's installment show \"Late Night Black and White\" and on Nickelodeon's \"Nick At Nite\" version of Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon.\n\nWhen this cartoon was shown in black and white on Cartoon Network's installment show \"Late Night Black and White\", the time-compressed Golden Jubilee VHS print was used.[2]\n\nSome non-US televised and video prints (i.e.: released on the Carrotblanca VHS[3]) of the cartoon have the \"DUBBED VERSION (C) 1997 WARNER BROS.\" disclaimer on the computer-colorized print of the cartoon at the beginning, due to a foreign-language dub track produced.\n\nThis is the first Daffy Duck cartoon to be directed by Friz Freleng.\n\nIn 1994, it was voted #34 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.[4]\n\nOn the Sunset Productions/Guild Films print, the Leon Schlesinger Productions building sign is cut due to involvement with Warner Bros. This cut was made because Warner Bros. did not want to be associated with television back in 1955, when this cartoon was sold for television distribution. This scene has been restored in the computer-colorized version and on home video releases.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nDaffy Duck Cartoons 1937 Porky's Duck Hunt 1938 Daffy Duck & Egghead • What Price Porky • Porky & Daffy • The Daffy Doc • Daffy Duck in Hollywood 1939 Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur • Scalp Trouble • Wise Quacks 1940 Porky's Last Stand • You Ought to Be in Pictures 1941 A Coy Decoy • The Henpecked Duck 1942 Conrad the Sailor • Daffy's Southern Exposure • The Impatient Patient • The Daffy Duckaroo • My Favorite Duck 1943 To Duck .... or Not to Duck • The Wise Quacking Duck • Yankee Doodle Daffy • Porky Pig's Feat • Scrap Happy Daffy • A Corny Concerto • Daffy - The Commando 1944 Tom Turk and Daffy • Tick Tock Tuckered • Duck Soup to Nuts • Slightly Daffy • Plane Daffy • The Stupid Cupid 1945 Draftee Daffy • Ain't That Ducky • Nasty Quacks 1946 Book Revue • Baby Bottleneck • Daffy Doodles • Hollywood Daffy • The Great Piggy Bank Robbery 1947 Birth of a Notion • Along Came Daffy • A Pest in the House • Mexican Joyride 1948 What Makes Daffy Duck • Daffy Duck Slept Here • The Up-Standing Sitter • You Were Never Duckier • Daffy Dilly • The Stupor Salesman • Riff Raffy Daffy 1949 Wise Quackers • Holiday for Drumsticks • Daffy Duck Hunt 1950 Boobs in the Woods • The Scarlet Pumpernickel • His Bitter Half • Golden Yeggs • The Ducksters 1951 Rabbit Fire • Drip-Along Daffy • The Prize Pest 1952 Thumb Fun • Cracked Quack • Rabbit Seasoning • The Super Snooper • Fool Coverage 1953 Duck Amuck • Muscle Tussle • Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century • Duck!
