I'm trying to build up a family of non-conformists, and have managed to identify the parent's names through apprenticeship and burial records.

Thomas & Ann GREEN (nee YOUNG) were married 1710 at Bradwell-juxta-Coggeshall, Essex in 1710, both of the parish of Stebbing.

They had children publicly named at Athorp Rooting {alias Aythorpe Roding} though listed as Abbotts Roothing {alias Abbess Roding} Abbotts Meeting Rookwood Hall (Independent)

James 1716

Thomas 1717

Ann 1719

Jesse 1730 {b. abt. 1720 from apprenticeship record}

Micah 1730 {b. abt. 1722 from burial}

Robert 1730

Elizabeth Young 1730

But in all entries the parent's name is not listed, yet all other entries on the pages (available on ancestry) have parent's name given.

So, was there any particular reason a non-conformist couple would not want their details recorded?
