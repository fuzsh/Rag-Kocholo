The two parishes are within ten miles of Thurnham, where our ancestor William Spice arrived in the mid1500s. He named his only son \"John,\" but this is both a very common name and at this point we seem to be ptimarily arguing more from the lack of evidence. We do not yet know, for example, who were the beneficiaries in the Lenham wills or if Richard Spice had other children besides Agnes."
