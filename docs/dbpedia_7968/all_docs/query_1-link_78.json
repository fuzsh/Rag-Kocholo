        "text": "The Essex Way and I\n\nT he Essex Way has become an institution since its conception in 1972. It takes in 81 miles of varied Essex landscape, with its gentle ups and downs, seascapes, and a leafy green countryside simply oozing English history at almost every step. End points are Epping Station (Central Line) and Harwich High Lighthouse near Harwich Station (Network Rail).\n\nCelebration. I have just completed the last (15 mile) section from Harwich to Manningtree (Tuesday, June 23, 2009), and thought that a small celebration in the form of this web page might be in order. I hope that you like the pictures (for what they are worth!), and that what you see will encourage you to get your boots on, pack your camera, and start walking the Essex Way!!\n\nThe pictures you will see are a selection of ones I have taken at at different times and seasons in 2008 and 2009. The pictures provide a small preview of what you will see and experience on the different stages of the Essex Way. After each stage you can come back to them to see how many of the scenes you recognise as ones you have enjoyed - albeit perhaps at a time of year different from that in which I originally took the pictures.\n\nThe stages. I partitioned the walk into seven stages on the basis of public transport to the start and end points. The stages are shown in the above overview map and just below. Each stage had an average length just under 12 miles, with the Epping to Ongar stage being the shortest at about 8 miles, and the Lawford (near Manningtree) to Harwich stage being the longest at about 16 miles. Inevitably, some stages are only accessible by public transport on days other than Sundays and public holidays.\n\nEpping to Ongar\n\nOngar to Pepper's Green\n\nPepper's Green to Great Leighs\n\nGreat Leighs to Coggeshall\n\nCoggeshall to West Bergholt\n\nWest Bergholt to Lawford (near Manningtree)\n\nLawford (near Manningtree) to Harwich\n\nPostscript\n\nContact, Copyright & \"Readme\"\n\n1. Epping to Ongar\n\nE pping Station, the end the Central Line, marks the start of the 81 mile long Essex Way. This first stretch, to Ongar, is characterised by ancient woodland, with connections back to Anglo-Saxon times: Gernon Bushes contain pollarded Hornbeams, and Ongar Great Park is the oldest recorded deer park. Another - and famous - Saxon connection on this walk, is Greensted Church, dating back to 645 AD. Ongar, with its castle remains, its old church and half timbered buildings nodding to each other, evokes yet more history. Toothill, which used to be a lookout for highwaymen such as Dick Turpin (hence the \"toot\"), brings us closer to modern times. Highwaymen disappeared with the coming of the railways, and on this section of the walk, we are never far from the Epping-Ongar Railway, which is being restored by enthusiastic volunteers and is now partially open to the public.\n\nWhen I did the walk, the weather was typical for the end of March with cloudy winter still hanging on, but I managed to get some pictures. The date was Tuesday, March 31, 2009. The walk was short, so being keen to make up for this, I then walked from Ongar to Blackmore (the first part of St Peter's Way).\n\n2. Ongar to Pepper's Green\n\nVillage churches tend to say a lot about the history of the communities they serve. The two churches at Willingale share the same churchyard but actually belonged to bordering parishes, Willingdale Spain and Willingdale Doe. The church at Fyfield has an unusual spire, and the church at High Ongar was \"got at\" by over-zealous Victorians. At Cannon's, Green, there is something of a rarity in the shape of what might be the only thatched caravan in the world.\n\nMy walk was on a lovely sunny autumn day, fresh and a bit icy, but ideal for walking and taking pictures. The date was Wednesday, October 29, 2008. Because of travel considerations, I did the walk in the London direction. The start, at Pepper's Green, appears to be \"in the middle of nowhere\", and evokes surprise from bus-driver and passengers alike, when I ask to alight here.\n\n3. Pepper's Green to Great Leighs\n\nThe churches at Good Easter, High Easter, Great Waltham and Little Leighs are certainly all worth visiting. However, on this part of the walk, the historical mix is made even more interesting by the village of Pleshey of Shakespearian fame and by Langleys, the imposing Queen Anne residence of the Tufnell family.\n\nWhat a fine and fresh autumn day. The date was Wednesday, October 22, 2008. Once again, I surprised the bus driver and his human charges by requesting to alight \"in the middle of nowhere\". This time I am walking towards the East, in fact to Great Leighs, home of the short-lived race course, which might be reopened some day.\n\n4. Great Leighs to Coggeshall\n\nThe distinctive round tower of Great Leighs Church, the early mediaeval wall paintings of Fairstead Church, the village of Terling, the Queen Anne residence of Langleys and the Great Barn at Coggeshall were some of the notable features of this part of the Essex Way.\n\nThis walk was done on two different days, and the walks on both days were blessed with good walking weather.\n\nLittle Leighs to Terling - September 18, 2008\n\nGreat Leighs to Coggeshall - September 20, 2008\n\nLittle Leighs to Terling - September 18, 2008\n\nGreat Leighs to Coggeshall - September 20, 2008\n\n5. Coggeshall to West Bergholt\n\nC oggeshall was a prosperous mediaeval business centre, with - guess what - wool as the staple trade. Old buildings such as Paycocke's house, bear withness to this age of prosperity. The Chappel railway viaduct bears witness, in its turn, to the Victorian age of prosperity, when railways spread their tentacles to almost every corner of the land. West (not East!) Berholt, at the other end of the walk, is also certainly not without historical interest.\n\nThe main part of this section of the Essex Way was \"walked\" on two different days. The first time (2008 November 21) was from West Bergholt almost to the outskirts of Coggeshall. The second time (2009 January 30) was from Coggeshall to West Bergholt. These were winter walks, but again, both walks were blessed with good weather. The days are presented here in reverse order.\n\nThe third and fourth set of pictures are from targetted visits to Chappel and Wakes Colne (2008 May 14) and to Coggeshall (2008 May 20) respectively. Despite the targetted nature of these two visits, it was felt that the pictures taken on these occasions would provide a fitting addition to this web-based presentation.\n\nWest Bergholt to Coggeshall - 2008 November 21\n\nCoggeshall to West Bergholt - 2009 January 30\n\nChappel and Wakes Colne - 2008 May 14\n\nCoggeshall 2008 May 20\n\nCoggeshall to West Bergholt - January 30, 2009\n\nWest Bergholt to the outskirts of Coggeshall - November 21, 2008\n\nChappel and Wakes Colne - May 14, 2008\n\nCoggeshall - May 20, 2008\n\n6. West Bergholt to Lawford (near Manningtree)\n\nThis part of the Essex Way is in fact the southern part of the well known circular Constable Country walk. After West Bergholt, a vineyard complete with wine tasting gave this walk added zest. We then pass Lawford Hall and visit Lawford church with its \"Dumb Animals Petition\" and other items of interest. Then we enter Constable Country and head for Dedham, with its traditional buildings, including Shermans, where the ancestor of General Sherman (of USA tank fame) once lived. As can be expected, the time-honoured Dedham church is steeped in history. Just across the rtoad from the church, the Duke of Wellington pub (which does a good cider), used to be the local Wool Exchange, for Dedham, like Coggeshall, grew prosperous when the mediaeval wool trade was in its heyday. Lawford church, just south of Maningtree Station, also has an interesting history to tell; Cromwell did not like the 14th Century stone renditions of locals merry making, but luckily some of this art has survived his destructive influence for us to marvel at.\n\nMy walk was on Wednesday June 17, 2009. The weather was good for walking - not too hot and a mixture of sunshine and cloud. For logistical reasons, I did the walk in the reverse direction (towards London).\n\n7. Lawford (near Manningtree) to Harwich\n\nM anningtree is the railway junction, where the line to the once famous seaport of Harwich diverges from the main line to Ipswich, Norwich and the furthest reaches of the Eastern Counties. The nearby Mistley towers are the remnants of Robert Adams's 18th Century church. Malty aromas from the nearby English Diastatic Malt Extract Company often provided added spice to the scene. Then comes Bradwell, followed by Wrabness with its nature reserve and the church with its free-standing bell cage, reminiscent of East Bergholt. The Suffolk coast line stretches along the other side of the Orwell Esturary, all the way to Harwich. We then come to Ramsey, with its post-mill. Up and out of the dip in which Ramsey village lies, we eventually come to the wide sweep of Dovercourt Bay, with its light houses. And so to Harwich with two more light houses, interesting old buildings, the Electric Palace, and views of Felixstowe Docks on the Suffolk side. The High Lighthouse in Harwich, close to the railway station, marks the end - or beginning - of the Essex Way - all 82 miles of it.\n\nTuesday June 23, 2009\n\nThe weather was rather hot with a clear blue sky - only a few wisps of cloud. I downed almost a litre of water on the way. (For logistical reasons, I did the walk in the reverse direction - towards London).\n\nPostscript\n\nThe Essex Way can be done in most weathers. It can be accessed by public transport at most days of the week and most times of the day. If you have stout walking boots, rucksack and camera, there should be nothing in the way of you and the Essex Way!"
