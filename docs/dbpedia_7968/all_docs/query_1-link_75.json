(searched 1757-1812!)\n\nThe daughter Mary Rolfe married at Great Leighs, where she remained till her death.\n\nI have a copy of a beautiful will of Daniel Rolfe of Black Notley (who owned land in Black & White Notley) dated 1709 who names his wife Mary and all his children: Daniel, John, Thomas, Sarah & Mary whom I'm sure my Daniel is related to...I just need to find his marriage & baptism!\n\nI'm still working my way through all the registers, one by one...hopefully the next one will be the right one!\n\nso far I've searched Black Notley, White Notley, Bradwell-juxta-Coggeshall, Cressing, Fairsted, Faulkbourne, Felsted, Pattiswick, Rayne, Rivenhall, Terling, Witham & Coggeshall.\n\nParishes of Bocking, Braintree, Chelmsford, Dunmow, Great Leighs, Great Saling, Little Leighs, Panfield & Stisted appear to be covered by FMP marriage index, though I need to double check the registers myself as the indexes may still miss some.\n\nNext to search is Stebbing, Hatfield, Kelvedon, Great Waltham, Little Waltham & Pleshey\n\nI am calling it the Notley triangle ...where the marriages go missing!\n\nYes thanks, I've already looked at that one, but he would have had to have been widowed very quickly to have been having children with Susan. Or there is the possibility that the curate made a mistake with the mother's name in the Black Notley baptism Register and it should have been Mary.\n\nI'm going to go back to the Great Leighs register and double check the burials in case Daniel & Susan were buried there, as I can't find any suitable burials at Black or White Notley either! And also check to see if the other Daniel & mary had children baptised there from 1898.\n\nThere was one Daniel Rolfe who was buried at Great Leighs in 1835 aged 78, so could have been the Daniel who married Mary Johnson, and could also be the father of my Mary & Daniel ...but I could not find a burial of a Mary Rolfe or a Susan Rolfe.\n\nI also found a possible cousin of Daniel..John Rolfe married Maria Jarvis at Great Leighs in 1830, and I traced his birth back to John & Sarah Rolfe at White Notley...but no sign of any children of Daniel & Mary or more children of Daniel & Susan...maybe he did have two wives and they both died suddenly in childbirth...\n\nthe search goes on...and on...\n\nHaving followed the John Rolfe of White Notley back through the registers and connected him to the original Rolfes from the will, I noticed that between 1792 and 1805, the family were entered in the register as ROFFE!\n\nNot that it makes much difference to me, as I am extracting any names that sound or look similar:ROLFE, ROFFE, RALPH, ROLPH etc. but does make a difference when searching Indexes.\n\nA bit off topic, but I just searched SEAX for ROFFE at Great Leighs and found this rather amusing entry from the Quarter Sessions of 1574\n\n\"Of the miserable state of Joan Sponer dwelling in the parish of High Easter, who has had her further abode in the parish of Much LEIGHS, where she was born, being at this present time with child as she says by Thomas ROFFE of High Easter aforesaid, who did promise her marriage as she says, and who, upon accusation by the said Joan, did fly the country and is gone and has left behind him certain goods in the possession of his father and others of his friends to the value of Â£40 or more. The said Joan has since repaired in her extremity to the parish of Felstead and is vagrant there in great misery, the said parish being greatly charged with much poverty at this time. Requests therefore that the case of the said parish may be considered in placing the said Joan in some place to her present comfort, as the hope of the ingabitants of the said parish is at this time.\n\nIt is ordered that the father of the offender called John Roff shall receive the woman and take order for the keeping of her until his son may be brought forth, and further order taken in the premises.\""
