        "text": "index\n\nNote: because of the manorial system of the East Saxons, Essex has a considerable number of placenames which are made up of two words. These places are listed in the index under the first word of the placename. However, Greats and Littles are listed twice - once under G or L respectively, and again under the second word. Similarly, the eight parishes known as the Rodings are also listed twice, once under their first word and again under R.\n\nAbberton, Abbess Roding, Abridge, Aldham, Alphamstone, Alresford, Althorne,
