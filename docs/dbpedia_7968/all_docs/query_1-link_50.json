Newton.\n\nWritten 18 Jan 1736/7, probate 5 Feb 1736/7.\n\nERO\n\nTranscriber’s notes: Robert Wyles (also Robert Wiles) was born in Great Bromley, and baptised there on 25 Jan 1684/85, the eldest surviving son of Robert Wiles and his wife Mary. His marriage to Susanna has not yet been found. After his death, his wife remarried. There are two marriages (with licences) for widows called Susanna/Susan Wiles who lived in Great Bromley: one, aged about 30, married Nicholas Bundock (marriage licence dated 22 Dec 1739), and the other married Thomas Cooker of Elmstead in 1743. It seems likely that the one who married Thomas Cooker was Robert Wiles’ widow, as the one who married Nicholas Bundock was somewhat younger than Robert.\n\nRobert’s brother Benjamin was born about four years after him. It appears that he and his wife Mary had a daughter Elizabeth baptised in Frating on 1 March 1718/9. It is possible that Robert’s brother then moved to Copford, although his wife’s name is given as Elizabeth when their children were baptised, which ryles him out – that said, a Benjamin Wiles was buried in Copford in April 1736, which would match with Robert stating that his brother was “lately deceased”. However, it seems more likely that Benjamin married and lived in Elmstead: marriages and baptisms are lost between the 1660s-1728, so if he married there, and had children baptised there, those records are now lost. However, Elmstead burials are only lost between 1661-1677, and there is a burial in Elmstead for an infant called Mary Wiles in 1718. An Elizabeth Wiles was buried in Elmstead in 1750, who could be Benjamin and Mary’s daughter baptised in Frating in 1719. Mary Wiles of Frating was buried in Elmstead in 1763 – she is the Mary Wiles, widow of Frating, whose short will leaves everything, including Tasselers in Wivenhoe, to her daughter Sarah, wife of Samuel Bacon of Wivenhoe. This implies that she had no other surviving children, however, Robert left his nephew Benjamin all his copyhold property, and nothing for his sisters, so Mary perhaps felt that Benjamin didn’t need to be left anything. When Sarah Bacon wrote her will, she left her property to her “cousin”, another Benjamin Wiles, who would have been Robert’s great-nephew (the third in a row of Benjamins), and property in Wivenhoe her “cousin” James Norman (a man by that name married Mary Wiles, a daughter of Robert’s nephew Benjamin). She left legacies (among others) to George Jaggard senior and his daughter Ruth (Ruth’s mother was Ruth Wiles, Benjamin’s daughter). Trying to find the baptism, and therefore the parents, of Benjamin Wiles, whose descendants include Jaggards and Hazells, and thanks to his granddaughter Mary Jaggard, the many Fields of Brightlingsea, has been difficult, but the wills of Robert Wyles, Mary Wiles, and Sarah Bacon demonstrate that he was the son of Robert’s brother Benjamin. The deeds for Tasselers are at the Essex Record Office and need to be examined because it might tell us where Mary Wiles got Tasselers from. She may have bought it, but equally, she or her husband could have inherited it.\n\nSarah Bowell is likely to be Robert’s niece. His sister Sarah married John Bowles of Frating on 11 Feb 1710/11, and there are baptisms for two daughters there: Sarah in 1718 and Elizabeth in 1719.\n\nThen we have the mystery of Thomas Burnham and Elizabeth Dunton. The clue appears to be in the name Burnham, as Mary Burnam married Ezekiel Dunton at Lawford in 1711 – they were both of Ardleigh. There are four baptisms for their children at Ardleigh, including Elizabeth, baptised there in 1718. Mary Burnham was likely born around 1690, and there’s a marriage in 1728 for a Thomas Burnham, aged 35 (giving him a rough date of birth of 1693) to Frances More. He lived in Greenstead, which is right next door to Ardleigh. He might be the same Thomas Burnham who married Mary Tracy at Great Bromley on 31 Jan 1743/4 (no marriage statuses in the register, unfortunately), and they had four children, all baptised at Colchester St Peter’s. Perhaps it’s coincidence, or perhaps not, but a Benjamin Wiles married an Elizabeth Moore in Colchester in the same year as Thomas Burnham married Frances More.\n\nBut how are the Burnhams actually related to Robert? He uses “kinsman” and “kinswoman” to refer to nieces and nephews on his Wiles side, but it doesn’t look like he had a sister who could’ve married a Burnham, unless there’s one who was older than the children we currently know about. It’s possible that Thomas Burnham and Elizabeth Dunton were his wife’s relatives, although this isn’t stated. His mother was Mary Champneys from Frating, so there might be a some mileage in looking for connections between the Champneys and the Burnhams. A William Moore married a Margaret Champnes at Frating in 1690: Margaret might be Mary Champney’s sister.\n\nBack to top\n\nWiles, William of Great Bromley, 1669\n\nyoungest son Robert: all copyhold in Great Bromley\n\nwife Ann: £40 to satisfy a bond with Mr Thomas Seburan of Langham (amongst other legacies)\n\neldest son William: £15\n\ndaughter Elizabeth Siday: £45\n\ngrandson William Wiles, under 21\n\nWitnesses: David Siday, James Mallet, Edward Turner\n\nWritten 4 April 1669, probate 14 Jun 1669\n\nERO\n\nTranscriber’s notes: the testator is the grandfather of Robert Wiles of Great Bromley (see his will above). William’s son Robert senr stayed in Great Bromley, where he and his wife Mary had several children, including Robert junr. Robert senior died in 1700, but didn’t leave a will; letters of administration were granted to his widow Mary (“Marie”) on 17 Aug 1700 (held at ERO). William’s son William moved to Frating, where his son William was baptised in 1668. The testator married Ann Godfree, a widow, in Langham in 1665.\n\nThe testator doesn’t give the names of his copyhold in Great Bromley, but it may well be the copyhold that his grandson Robert left for his nephew (William’s great-grandson) Benjamin Wiles: Fenhouse and East Hayes. After the death of Robert senior’s widow Mary, the property likely descended to Robert junior, and without having children of his own, Robert left it to his brother’s son to keep it in the Wiles family. The manorial records for Great Bromley need to be checked.\n\nBack to top\n\nWinch, Catherine of Wix, widow of Samuel Winch, 1774\n\nTo son Samuel Winch: copyhold in Fingringhoe called variously Welmans Belsers and\n\nSarkneys.\n\nBut if Samuel dies under 21, to go to nephew John Cardinall of Tendring.\n\nRest and residue to son Samuel.\n\nExecutors: brother Clarkson Cardinall, gent, and son Samuel Winch\n\nWitnesses: Joseph Harris, John Read, Mary Bird x\n\nWritten: 24th March 1774, proved: 2nd May 1774\n\nERO ref: D/ACW 33/4/17\n\nBack to top\n\nWright, George, farmer of West Bergholt, 1831\n\nTo son George Wright of Lexden, carpenter, £20\n\nTo George’s daughter Susanna Wright, who now resides with me, £10 (to put her out as an apprentice or for her advancement)\n\nTo my niece Susan Green who now resides with me, £20\n\nSuitable mourning for Susanna Wright and Susan Green\n\nHousehold furniture, live and dead farming stock, money, securities and other personal estate to be divided between my two sons, William Dennis Wright and John Wright\n\nAlso to William Dennis Wright and John Wright, my copyhold called “Little Priors”, on the road from West Bergholt heath to the church.
