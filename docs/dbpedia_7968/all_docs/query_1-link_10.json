        "text": "1, The hospitium, or guest-house. Also known colloquially as the 'Monk House'.\n\nBEGINNINGS\n\nCoggeshall Abbey was founded as a Savigniac house c.1140 by Queen Matilda, wife of King Stephen. She had inherited the manor of Coggeshall, and endowed it to the new abbey.\n\nIt proved an ideal ready-made site for the Cistercian order when it took over in 1147, having absorbed the impoverished Savigniac order and all its houses. Being reclusive, the Cistercians liked to settle in quiet river valleys where they could build fishponds and water mills, and farm sheep, and they evidently took to this new acquisition with great delight.\n\nThe order rapidly extended and built upon the abbey's facilities and assets, and established the woollen and cloth trade that eventually made Coggeshall such a wealthy town.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nAt first, there were plentiful Roman remains around to provide building materials for the earliest phases of construction, but when these ran out the abbey turned its hand to brickmaking in order to continue constructing the abbey and its ranges. The abbey's well-known bricks include many specific mouldings that are not found anywhere else. Notable survivals include the guest-house (see photo above).\n\nAs well as the abbey church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, there were also quadrangular cloisters and a range of other rooms and offices, including a chapter house, refectory (dining hall), library, dormitory, a hospitium (guest house), infirmary (hospital), plus - of course - lodgings for the abbot himself, all presumably making good use of Coggeshall bricks.\n\nThe bricks, or tiles as they were then called, were made just to the north of the town centre in a place still called Tilkey, which is a corruption of 'tile kiln'. They are much broader and thinner than modern bricks, being about 12 inches by 6, and between 1.5 and 2 inches thick, so they may indeed have first developed as an enhanced form of tile.\n\nThe period of Coggeshall brickmaking lasted, according to some sources, from c.1190 to c.1220, and as such has long been considered to have been the earliest ever post-Roman British brickmaking industry.\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nRecent research has, however, found isolated examples of brickwork at the parish churches of Bradwell-juxta-Coggeshall (Essex) and Polstead (Suffolk), that may be a few decades older than 1190, suggesting that an earlier brickmaking site existed.\n\nIt is notable, however, that both these churches are not very far from Coggeshall, so their bricks could feasibly have come from the Tilkey tile kiln, if it was the brickworks in operation prior to the 1190's (perhaps it began operating in the 1140's, as part of the founding of Coggeshall Abbey, or with the introduction of the Cistercians a decade later).\n\n5 & 6. An old print and a modern photo, showing the ambulatory\n\nIn support of this suggestion, Coggeshall bricks have been attributed to earlier than 1190 by some people, notably J. S. Gardner who noted their use in the walls of Coggeshall parish church, dedicated in 1167; he also believed that their local manufacture might indeed date from the arrival of the Cistercians. Thus, Coggeshall bricks could still be the oldest post-Roman bricks around.\n\nThis earliest period of brickmaking still has some dating controversy though; did the Cistercians introduce the technology from France, where their order had been using it just prior to their appearance at Coggeshall, or was it already a fledgling industry at Tilkey on their arrival, which was seized upon and rapidly developed by their characteristic industrial aptitude? The jury is still out.\n\nA regional distribution map of the location of surviving Coggeshall brickwork has been made by P J Drury (see below), which also marks three other places where very early bricks have been found. One of these is Waltham Abbey, and the author mentions Peter Huggins' report of excavations in 1970-72, where the Waltham Abbey bricks are described as being \"only slightly later\" than the Coggeshall ones. Drury supposes that Coggeshall Abbey sold off surplus bricks to other religious construction sites at the time of its own development.\n\n7. Distribution map of Coggeshall brick, P J Drury (after W Rodwell)\n\nDISSOLUTION\n\nCoggeshall Abbey was demolished in 1538 as the Dissolution swept across the country. Its buildings and estates were bought by Sir Thomas Seymour, who swapped them for other lands with the Crown in 1541. Unlike Waltham Abbey, its church of St. Mary wasn't the parish church, so it was destroyed as part of the abbey's property.\n\nBut like Waltham Abbey, some of the abbey's other structures did survive, mostly as ruins though at both places one structure remained intact. See the page on St. Nicholas' Chapel for more on this story at Coggeshall.\n\nBy 1581, that Paycocke family which keeps popping up in Coggeshall's history made another appearance, when Anne Paycocke and her husband Richard Benyan acquired the abbey ruins and built the east wing of the present Abbey House, around the remains of the abbey's infirmary. The house, now the main residence of Abbey Farm, was heavily altered in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, though it still retains many early features, including 16th century chimney stacks, oriel windows and the west porch, and other important features survive from each later phase of its own development.\n\n8. The Plott of certeine Lands Belonging to the Abbye of Coggeshall, 1639\n\nOf the abbey church and the conventual buildings, all that survives now are foundations and buried remains, except for parts of the eastern wing of the claustral range, the guesthouse and the abbot's lodgings, which still stand. The farm's timber-framed outbuildings date mainly to the late 16th to early 17th century. Despite being post-Dissolution they are still fine examples of their kind and have been listed.\n\nThe earthworks of the abbey's fish ponds still survive, and adjacent land includes an area of former water meadows which has recently been restored. The abbey precinct and surviving remains are designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\n10. The Abbey Mill, view from the north\n\nThe Abbey Mill has a breast-shot water wheel; this is the same type used for the incorporating mill at Waltham Abbey's gunpowder factory.\n\nGUIDED TOUR:\n\nThe owner of Abbey Farm, Mr. Robert Hadlee, will welcome us on our arrival with tea and cakes. He will then guide us around the abbey complex remains. This part of our day will take about 2 hours.\n\nSOME EXTERNAL LINKS:\n\nQueen Matilda (Wikipedia)\n\nCistercian Abbeys: Coggeshall (a brief academic history)\n\nCoggeshall Abbey and its early bricks - Museum article\n\nThe production of brick and tile in medieval England, P J Drury\n\nThe Abbey of Coggeshall (Victoria County History)\n\nCoggeshall Abbey (SEAX archaeological overview)\n\nCoggeshall Abbey - archaeological remains\n\nCoggeshall Abbey Mill's History\n\nCoggeshall Abbey Mill (SEAX archaeological overview)\n\nEcclesiastical sites and structures in Essex, W Rodwell\n\n(an overview of current archaeological knowledge)\n\nSir Thomas Seymour (Wikipedia)\n\nBACK TO THE EXCURSION OVERVIEW\n\nBACK TO SAINT NICHOLAS' CHAPEL\n\nBACK TO NEWS & EVENTS\n\nPhotos:\n\n1, 4, 10: Â© Copyright Lawrence Greenall / WAHS 2008.\n\n2, 3, 6: Coggeshall Museum website\n\n5: Essex Record Office, ref.
