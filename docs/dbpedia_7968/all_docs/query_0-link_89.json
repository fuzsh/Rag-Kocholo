        "text": "Between 1189-99, Osbert fitz Hervey, the king's justice, was granted Dagworth by Geoffrey, Count de Perch. Osbert started out as an obscure\n\nEast Anglian knight, but at his death had a greater annual income than most\n\nBarons. And then a peasant named Thurkill had a vision that described\n\ngraphically how a corrupt judge was being punished in the afterlife. More...Meanwhile, Ralph of Coggeshall recorded in the Chronicon Anglicanum that \"a certain fantastical spirit\" called Malekin appeared frequently in Osbert's\n\nhouse at Dagworth over a long period. More...In 1205, Osbert died and the manor passed to his son and heir, Richard de Dagworth, who was a minor who became the ward of William de Huntingfield\n\nand was married to his daughter Isabel de Huntingfield.On 10 March 1216, King John stayed at Dagworth en route from Cambridge to Framlingham, where he then laid siege to the castle. More...In 1234, Richard died, and the manor passed to his son and heir, Osbert de Dagworth, who married Hawise. He fought in Gascony in 1253 and Wales in\n\n1257. He was granted Free Warren in 1253.In 1260, Osbert died and the manor passed to his 9 year old son John de Dagworth. He married Maud de l'Escheker, who inherited the office of Usher\n\nof the Exchequer and a one third interest in the Marshalsy of the Eyre.John died on 17 October 1290, and the manor passed to his son and heir, another John de Dagworth, born 25 April 1276. He married Alice fitz Warin,\n\nand they had two sons, Nicholas and Thomas. John was both Usher of the\n\nExchequer and Marshal of the Eyre, and he was summoned to a parliament\n\nin York in May 1322. At his death, he held 363 acres of land at Dagworth \"by\n\nservice of three long arrows\".John died 7 July 1332, and the manor passed to his son and heir Nicholas de Dagworth (born bef. 1306), who married Margaret. On 17 March 1345/6,\n\nNicholas was discharged from finding a man-at-arms because his brother\n\nThomas was on the Kingâ€™s service in Brittany, and his (younger) son\n\n(Nicholas) was with Thomas, and he himself was too infirm to labour.Nicholas' brother Thomas de Dagworth was a famous captain in the Hundred Years War. He married Eleanor de Bohun, widow of Sir James le Boteler, 1st\n\nEarl of Ormond. He defeated Charles de Blois at the Battle of La Roche-\n\nDerien, near Treguier, 20 June 1347, and took him prisoner. He was\n\nsummoned to Parliament 13 Nov 1347 and 14 Feb 1347/8. He was killed in\n\nan ambush near Aurai in Brittany in July or August 1350.Nicholas died 12 Oct 1351, and the manor passed to his son and heir John de Dagworth (born bef. 1327). He married before 12 June 1353, Thomasine,\n\nand died 16 Aug 1360, leaving a daughter and heir, Margaret, aged 2 and\n\nmore in 1363.John's brother Nicholas de Dagworth, who was with his uncle Thomas in Brittany in 1345, became another celebrated captain and then a diplomat.\n\nHe inherited some of the family lands, and acquired the Manor of Blickling in\n\nNorfolk, where he died without issue Jan 1401/2 and is buried in the church.John's widow Thomasine held Dagworth in dower, and married 2ndly before 20 Jan 1365/6, Sir William de Furnival. We know from a petition to the King\n\nthat it was an unhappy marriage, but they had a daughter Joan.William died 12 Apr 1383, and Dagworth passed back to Thomasine."
