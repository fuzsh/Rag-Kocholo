A financial system is a composition of various institutions, markets, regulations and laws, practices, money manager, analysts, transactions and claims and liabilities.\n\nMoney Market Instruments Financial Assets/ Instruments\n\nCapital market Instrument Hybrid Instrument Forex Market Credit Market Primary Market\n\nFinancial Market\n\nMoney Market Secondary Market\n\nFinancial Intermediaries\n\nPrimary Market Capital Market Secondary Market\n\n1. FINANCIAL ASSETS/ INSTRUMENTS A. Money Market Instruments\n\nPage\n\n4\n\nThe money market can be defined as a market for short-term money and financial assets that are near substitutes for money. The term short-term means generally a period up to one year and near substitutes to money is used to denote any financial assets which can be quickly converted into money with minimum transaction cost. Some of the important money market instruments are briefly discussed below: 1. Call/Notice Money 2. Treasury Bills 3. Term Money 4. Certificate of Deposits 5. Commercial Papers 1. Call/Notice- Money Market: Call/Notice money is the money borrowed or lent on demand for a very short period. When money is borrowed or lent for a day, it is known as Call (Overnight) Money. Intervening holidays and/or Sunday are excluded for this purpose. Thus money, borrowed on a day and repaid on the next working day (irrespective of the number of intervening holidays) is “Call Money”. When money is borrowed or lent for more than a day and up to 14 days, it is “Notice Money”. No collateral security is required to cover these transactions. 2. Treasury Bills: Treasury Bills are short term (up to one year) borrowing instruments of the Union Government. It is an IOU of the Government. It is a promise by the government to pay a stated sum after expiry of the stated period from the date of issue (14/91/182/364 days i.e. less than one year). They are issued at a discount to the face value, and on maturity the face value is paid to the holder. The rate of discount and the corresponding issue price are determined at each auction. 3. Inter-Bank Term Money: Inter-Bank Market for deposits of maturity beyond 14 days is referred to as the term money market. The entry restrictions are the same as those for Call/Notice Money except that, as per existing regulations, they specified entities are not allowed to lend beyond 14 days. 4. Certificate of Deposits: Certificate of Deposits (CDs) is a negotiable money market instrument and issued in dematerialised form or as a Usance Promissory Note, for funds deposited at a bank or other eligible financial institutions for a specified time period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by the Reserve Bank of India, as amended from time to time. CDs can be issued by:(i) Scheduled Commercial Banks excluding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Local Area Banks (LABs), and\n\n(ii)\n\nSelect all-India Financial Institutions that have been permitted by RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by RBI. Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending on their requirements. An FI may issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit fixed by RBI, i.e. issued of CD together with other instruments viz., term money, term deposits, commercial papers and inter corporate deposits should not exceed 100% of its net owned funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet. 5. Commercial Paper: CP is a note in evidence of the debt obligation of the issuer. On issuing commercial paper the debt obligation is transformed into an instrument. CP is thus an unsecured promissory note privately placed with investors at a discount rate to face value determined by market forces. CP is freely negotiable by endorsement and delivery. A company shall be eligible to issue CP provided(a) The tangible net worth of the company, as per the latest audited balance sheet, is not less than Rs.4 crore; (b) The working capital (fund-based) limit of the company from the banking system is not less than Rs. 4 crore; (c) The borrowable account of the company is classified as a Standard Asset by the financing banks; The minimum maturity period of CP is 7 days. The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of CRISIL or such equivalent rating by other agencies.\n\nB. CAPITAL MARKET INSTRUMENTS The capital market generally consists of the following long term period i.e., more than one year period, financial instruments; in the equity segment Equity Shares, Preference shares, Convertible Preference Shares, Non-Convertible Preference Shares etc and in the debt segment debentures, zero coupon bonds, deep discounts bonds etc.\n\nEquity Segment 1.\n\n2.\n\n3. 4. 5.\n\n6.\n\nEquity Shares: In accounting and finance Equity is the residual claim or interest of the most junior class of investors in assets, after all liabilities are paid. If liability exceeds assets, negative equity exists. In an accounting context, shareholders’ equity (or stockholder’ equity, shareholders’ funds, shareholders capital or similar terms) represents the remaining interest in assets of a company, spread among individual shareholders of common or preferred stock. Shareholder’s equity: When the owners are shareholders, the interest can be called shareholders equity; the accounting remains the same, and it is ownership equity spread out among shareholders. If all shareholders are in one and the same class, they share equally in ownership equity from all perspectives. However, shareholders may allow different priority ranking among themselves by the use of share classes and options. This complicates both analysis for stock valuation and accounting. Market value of Shares: In the stock market, market price per share does not correspond to the equity per share calculated in the accounting statements. Stock valuations, which are often much higher, are based on other considerations related to the business’ operating cash flow, profits and future prospects; some factors are derived from the accounting statements. Equity in Real Estate: The notion of equity with respect to real estate makes the equity of redemption. This equity is a property right valued at the difference between the market price of the property and the amount of any mortgage or other encumbrance. Preference Shares: Preference shares, or simply preferred, are a special equity security that has properties of both equity and a debt instrument and is generally considered a hybrid instrument. Preference Shareholders are senior (i.e. higher ranking) to common stock, but are subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company. Preference shares usually carry no voting rights, but may carry a dividend and may have priority’ over common stock in the payment of dividends and upon liquidation. Terms of the preferred stock are stated in a “Certificate of Destination”. Similar to bond, preferred stocks are rated by the major credit rating companies. The rating for Preferred is generally lower since preferred dividends do not carry the same guarantees as interest payments from bonds and they are junior to all creditors. Convertible Preference shares: These shares are corporate fixed income securities that the investor can choose to turn into a certain number of shares of the company’s common stock after a predetermined time span or on a specific date. The fixed income component offers a steady income stream and some protection of the investor’s capital. But the option to convert these securities into stock gives the investor the opportunity to gain from a rise in share price. Convertibles are particularly attractive to those investors who want to participate in the rise of hot growth companies while being insulated from a drop in price should the stocks not live up to expectations.\n\nDebt segment 1.\n\n2.\n\nPage\n\n5\n\n3.\n\nDebentures: A debenture is a document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it, and it is debt without collateral. In corporate finance, the term is used for a medium to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money. In some countries the term is used interchangeably with bound, loan stock or note. A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing the fact that the company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest and although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company’s capital structure, it does not become share capital. Senior debenture gets paid before subordinate debentures, and there are varying rates and payoff for these categories. Debentures are generally freely transferable by the debenture holder. Debenture holders have no rights to vote in the company’s general meetings of shareholders, but they may have separate meetings or votes e.g. on changes to the right attached to the debentures. The interest paid to them is a charge against profit in the company’s financial statements. There are two types of debentures: 1. Convertible debentures, which are convertible bonds or bonds that can be converted into equity shares of the issuing company after a predetermined period of time. “Convertibility” is a feature that corporations may add to the bonds they issue to make them more attractive to buyers. In other words, it is a special feature that a corporate bond may carry. As a result of the advantage buyer a gets from the ability to convert, convertible bonds typically have lower interest rates than non-convertible corporate bonds. 2. 2. Non-Convertible debentures, which are simply regular debentures, cannot be converted into equity shares of the liable company. They are debentures without the convertibility feature attached to them. As a result, they usually carry higher interest rates than their convertible counterparts. Zero Coupon Bonds: A zero-coupon bond (also called a discount bond or deep discount bond) is a bond bought at a price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid at the time of maturity. It does not make periodic interest payments, or have so-called “coupons”, hence the term zero-coupon bound. When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons. Deep Discount bonds: A Bond that is selling at a discount from par value and has a coupon rate significantly less than the prevailing rates of fixed-income securities with a similar risk profile.\n\nC. Hybrid instruments Hybrid instruments have both the features of equity and debenture. This kind of instruments is called as hybrid instruments. Examples are convertible debentures, warrants etc. Warrants: In finance, a warrant is a security that entities the holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a fixed exercise price until the expiry date.\n\n2. Financial Market A financial market can be defined as the market in which financial assets are created or transferred. As against a real transaction that involves exchange of money for real goods or services, a financial transaction involves creation or transfer of a financial asset. Financial Assets or Financial Instruments represents a clam to the payment of a sum of money sometime in the future and/or periodic payment in the form of interest or dividend.\n\nConstituents of Financial Markets The main constituents of Financial Markets are:\n\nA. Money Market The money market is a wholesale debt market for low-risk, highly-liquid, short-term instrument. Funds are available in this market for periods ranging from a single day up to a year. This market is a dominated mostly by government, banks and financial institutions.\n\nB. Capital Market Capital Market may be defined as market dealing in medium and long-term funds. It is an institutional arrangement for borrowing medium and long-term funds and which provides facilities for marketing and trading of securities. So it constitutes all long-term borrowings from banks and financial institutions, borrowings from foreign markets and raising of capital by issue various securities such as shares debentures, bonds, etc. In the present chapter let us discuss about the market for trading of securities. The market where securities are traded known as Securities market. It consists of two different segments namely primary market deals with new or fresh issue of securities and is, therefore, also known as new issue market; whereas the secondary market provides a place for purchase and sale of existing securities and is often termed as stock market or stock exchange. A. Primary Market- The primary market consists of arrangements, which facilitate the procurement of long term funds by companies by making fresh issue of shares and debentures. You know that companies make fresh issue of shares and/or debentures at their formation stage and, if necessary, subsequently for the expansion of business. It is usually done through private placements to friends, relatives and financial institutions or by making public issue. B. Secondary Market- The secondary market known as stock market or stock exchange pays an equally important role in mobilising long-term funds by providing the necessary liquidity to holding in shares and debentures. It provides a place where these securities can be encashed without any difficulty and delay. It is an organised market where shares and debentures are traded regularly with high degree of transparency and security. In fact, an active secondary market facilitates the growth of primary market are assured of a continuous market for liquidity of their holdings. The major players in the primary market are merchant bankers, mutual funds, financial institutions and the individual investors; and in the secondary market you have all these and the stockbrokers who are members of the stock exchange who facilitate the trading.\n\nPage\n\n6\n\nDistinction between Capital Market and Money Market Capital Market differs from money market in many ways. First of all, while Money Market is related to short-term funds, the Capital Market related to long-term funds. Secondly, while Money Market deals in securities like treasury bills, commercial paper, trade bills, deposits certificates, etc., the Capital Market deals in shares, debentures, bonds and government securities. Thirdly, while the participants in Money Market are Reserve Bank of India, commercial banks, non-banking financial companies, etc., the participants in Capital Market are stockbroker, underwriters, mutual funds, financial institutions, and individual investors. Fourthly, while the Money Market is regulated by Reserve Bank of India, the Capital Market is regulated by Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nC. Forex Market-\n\nThe Forex Market deals with the multicurrency requirements, which are made by the exchange of currencies. Depending on the exchange rate that is applicable, the transfer of funds takes place in this market. This is one of the most developed and integrated market across the globe.\n\nD. Credit Market Credit Market is a place where banks, FIs and NBFCs purvey short, medium and long-term loans to corporate and individuals.\n\nDistinction between Primary Market and Secondary Market The main points of distinction between the primary market and secondary market are as follows: 1. Function: While the main function of primary market is to raise long-term funds through fresh issue of securities, the main function of secondary market is to provide continuous and ready market for the existing long-term securities. 2. Participants: While the major players in the primary market are financial institutions, mutual funds, underwriters and individual investors, the major players in secondary market are all of these and the stockbroker who are members of the stock exchange. 3. Listing Requirements: While only those securities can be dealt with in the secondary market, which have been approved for the purpose (listed), there is no such requirement in case of primary market. 4. Determination of prices: In case of primary market, the prices are determined by the management with due compliance with SEBI requirement for new issue of securities. But in case of secondary market. The price of the securities is determined by force of demand and supply of the market and keeps on fluctuating. Functions of Financial market a) It provides facilities for interaction between the investors and the borrowers. b) It provides pricing information resulting from the interaction between buyers and sellers in the market when they trade the financial assets. c) It provides security to dealings in financial assets. d) It ensures liquidity by providing a mechanism for an investor to sell the financial assets. e) It ensures low cost of transactions and information.\n\nStock Market National Stock Exchange (NSE) India National Stock Exchange In the year 1991 Pherwani Committee recommended to establish National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. In 1992 the Government of India authorised IDBI for establishing this exchange. In National Stock Exchange there is trading of equity shares, bonds and government securities. India’s Stock Exchanges particularly national Stock Exchange has achieved world standards in the recent years. The Index of NSE id called S&P CNX Nifty 50 (Standard & Poor’s Crisil NSE Index). The value of index is calculated by taking into consideration the movement in share price and trading volume of total 50 shares. Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Bombay Stock Exchange is one of the oldest stock exchanges in Asia was established in the year 1875 in the name of “The Native Share & Stock Brokers Association”. Bombay Stock Exchange is located at Dalal Street, Mumbai, India. It got recognition in 1956 from the Government of India under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Presently BSE SENSEX is recognised over the world. The index of BSE is called Sensex (Sensitivity Index). The value of index is calculated by taking into consideration the movement in share price and trading volume of total 30 shares.\n\n3. FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION\n\nPage\n\n7\n\nFinancial Intermediation is a systematic channel within the financial system to ensure the transfer of financial assets to the ultimate investor in order to garner the requisite amount. Financial intermediation in the organised sector is conducted by a wide range of institutions functioning under the overall surveillance of the Reserve Bank of India. In the initial stages, the role of the intermediary was mostly related to ensure transfer of funds from the lender to the borrower. This service was offered by banks, FIs, brokers and dealers. However, as the financial system widened along with the developments taking place in the financial markets, the scope of its operations also widened. Some of the important intermediaries operating in the financial markets include; investment bankers, underwriters, stock exchanges, registrars, depositories, custodian, portfolio managers, mutual funds, financial advertiser financial advertisers financial consultants, primary dealers, satellite dealers, self-regulatory organisations, etc. Through the markets are different, there may be a few intermediaries offering their services in more than one market e.g. underwriter. However, the services offered by them vary from one market to another.

In 1990’s, the then govt. embarked on policy of liberalisation, licencing a small number of private banks. These come to be known as New Generation Tech Savvy banks and included Global trust banks. (The first of such New Generation Banks to be set up) which amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce, UTI (Since Renamed AXIS Bank), ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank.

The central bank now wants to create a post of Chief Operating Officer(COO) and re-allocate work between the five of them (4 Deputy Governor and COO).\n\nPage\n\n10\n\nGovernorsThe Governor of RESERVE BANK OF INDIA is Raghu ram Rajan. There are 4 Deputy Governors H R Khan, Dr Urjit Patel, R Gandhi and S S MUNDRA. Dr. Urjit Patel became Deputy Governor in January 2013. Two of the four Deputy Governors is traditionally from RBI ranks, and is selected from the Bank's Executive Directors. As for the rest, one is nominated from among the Chairpersons of Public Sector Bank, and the other is an economist of repute. It is also often seen that an officer of Indian Administrative Service is appointed Deputy Governor of\n\nRBI and later as the Governor of RBI. The case of Y. Venugopal Reddy, an officer of Indian Administrative Service batch of 1964 is a noted example for this trend in the RBI.\n\nRole and Function of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) In every country there is one organization which works as the central bank. The function of the central bank of a country is to control and monitor the banking and financial system of the country. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the Central Bank. The RBI was established in 1935. It was nationalised in 1949. The RBI plays role of regulator of the banking system in India. The Banking Regulation Act 1949 and the RBI Act 1953 has given the RBI the power to regulate the banking system. The RBI has different functions in different roles. Below, we share and discuss some of the functions of the RBI.\n\nRBI is the Regulator of Financial System The RBI regulates the Indian banking and financial system by issuing broad guidelines and instructions. The objectives of these regulations include:  Controlling money supply in the system,  Monitoring different key indicators like GDP and inflation,  Maintaining people’s confidence in the banking and financial system, and  Providing different tools for customers’ help, such as acting as the “Banking Ombudsman.”\n\nRBI is the Issuer of Monetary Policy The RBI formulates monetary policy twice a year. It reviews the policy every quarter as well. The main objectives of monitoring monetary policy are:  Inflation control  Control on bank credit  Interest rate control The tools used for implementation of the objectives of monetary policy are:  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR),  Open market operations,  Different Rates such as repo rate, reverse repo rate, and bank rate.\n\nPage\n\n11\n\nRBI is the Issuer of Currency Section 22 of the RBI Act gives authority to the RBI to issue currency notes. The RBI also takes action to control circulation of fake currency. RBI is the Controller and Supervisor of Banking Systems The RBI has been assigned the role of controlling and supervising the bank system in India. The RBI is responsible for controlling the overall operations of all banks in India. These banks may be:  Public sector banks  Private sector banks  Foreign banks  Co-operative banks, or  Regional rural banks The control and supervisory roles of the Reserve Bank of India is done through the following:\n\n\n\nIssue of Licence: Under the Banking Regulation Act 1949, the RBI has been given powers to grant licenses to commence new banking operations. The RBI also grants licenses to open new branches for existing banks. Under the licensing policy, the RBI provides banking services in areas that do not have this facility.  Prudential Norms: The RBI issues guidelines for credit control and management. The RBI is a member of the Banking Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). As such, they are responsible for implementation of international standards of capital adequacy norms and asset classification.  Corporate Governance: The RBI has power to control the appointment of the chairman and directors of banks in India. The RBI has powers to appoint additional directors in banks as well.  KYC Norms: To curb money laundering and prevent the use of the banking system for financial crimes, The RBI has “Know Your Customer “guidelines. Every bank has to ensure KYC norms are applied before allowing someone to open an account.  Transparency Norms: This means that every bank has to disclose their charges for providing services and customers have the right to know these charges.  Risk Management: The RBI provides guidelines to banks for taking the steps that are necessary to mitigate risk. They do this through risk management in Basel norms.  Audit and Inspection: The procedure of audit and inspection is controlled by the RBI through off-site and on-site monitoring system. On-site inspection is done by the RBI on the basis of “CAMELS”. Capital adequacy; Asset quality; Management; Earning; Liquidity; System and control.  Foreign Exchange Control: The RBI plays a crucial role in foreign exchange transactions. It does due diligence on every foreign transaction, including the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange. It takes steps to stop the fall in value of the Indian Rupee. The RBI also takes necessary steps to control the current account deficit. They also give support to promote export and the RBI provides a variety of options for NRIs.  Development: Being the banker of the Government of India, the RBI is responsible for implementation of the government’s policies related to agriculture and rural development. The RBI also ensures the flow of credit to other priority sectors as well. Section 54 of the RBI gives stress on giving specialized support for rural development. Priority sector lending is also in key focus area of the RBI. Apart from the above, the RBI publishes periodical review and data related to banking. The role and functions of the RBI cannot be described in a brief write up. The RBI plays a very important role in every aspect related to banking and finance. Finally the control of NBFCs and others in the financial world is also assigned with RBI.\n\nSCHEDULED BANKS All banks which are included in the Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 are scheduled banks. These banks comprise Scheduled Commercial Banks and Scheduled Cooperative Banks. These banks are eligible for certain facilities such as financial accommodation from RBI and are required to fulfil certain statutory obligation. The RBI is empowered to exclude any bank from the schedule whose: (1) Aggregate value of paid up capital and reserves fall below Rs 5 lakh (2) Affairs are conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of depositors (3) Goes into liquidation and ceases to transact banking business\n\nCOMMERCIAL BANKS A financial institution that provides services, such as accepting deposits, giving business loans and auto loans, mortgage lending, and basic investment products like savings accounts and certificates of deposit. The traditional commercial bank is a brick and mortar institution with tellers, safe deposit boxes, vaults and ATMs. However, some commercial banks do not have any physical branches and require consumers to complete all transactions by phone or Internet. In exchange, they generally pay higher interest rates on investments and deposits, and charge lower fees. Commercial banking activities are different than those of investment banking, which include underwriting, acting as an intermediary between an issuer of securities and the investing public, facilitating mergers and other corporate reorganizations, and also acting as a broker for institutional clients. Some commercial banks, such as Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, also have investment banking divisions, while others, such as Ally, operate strictly on the commercial side of the business.\n\nPublic Sector Banks\n\nPage\n\n12\n\nThese are banks where majority stake is held by the Government of India. Examples of public sector banks are: SBI, Bank of India, Canara Bank, etc. (As on 22-08-2015) Tagline/Slogan S.

IDFC\n\nPage\n\n14\n\nRegional Rural Banks – The nationalization of the banks in 1969 boosted the confidence of the public in the Banking system of the country. However, in the early 1970s, there was a feeling that even after nationalization, there were cultural issues which made it difficult for commercial banks, even under government ownership, to lend to farmers. This issue was taken up by the government and it set up Narasimham Working Group in 1975. On the basis of this committee’s recommendations, a Regional Rural Banks Ordinance was promulgated in September 1975, which was replaced by the Regional Rural Banks Act 1976. Genesis of Regional Rural Banks Regional Rural Banks came into existence on Gandhi Jayanti in 1975 with the formation of a Prathama Grameen Bank. The rural banks had the legislative backing of the Regional Rural Banks Act 1976. This act allowed the government to set up banks from time to time wherever it considered necessary. The RRBs were owned by three entities with their respective shares as follows:  Central Government → 50%  State government → 15%  Sponsor bank → 35%\n\nRegional Rural Banks were conceived as low cost institutions having a rural ethos, local feel and pro poor focus. Every bank was to be sponsored by a “Public Sector Bank”, however, they were planned as the self sustaining credit institution which were able to refinance their internal resources in themselves and were excepted from the statutory pre-emptions.\n\nProblems with Regional Rural Banks But the original assumptions were belied as within a very short time, most banks were making losses. The RRB concept was based upon the policy that they would lend only to the weaker sections of rural society, charging lower interest rates, opening branches in remote and rural areas and keep a low cost profile. But the commercial motivation was absent. Initially the banks expanded and by the end of year 1985 RRBS had opened 12606 branches. During this period their credit deposit Ratio (C.D.R) expanded very fast. In 1976 it was 165% and gradually declined to 104 % in December 1986. The Credit Deposit Ratio continuously declined thereafter. Later, the questions started being raised about the viability of these banks. The Khusrau Committee of 1989, noted that the weaknesses of RRBs are endemic to the system and non-viability is built into it, and the only option was to merge the RRBs with the sponsor banks. The objective of serving the weaker sections effectively could be achieved only by self-sustaining credit institutions. RRBs were finding themselves unable to sustain because of the mounting losses due to imprudent commercial policy. Thus, Khusrau Committee (aka Agricultural Credit Review Committee) said that the RRBs have no justifiable cause for continuance and recommended their mergers with sponsor banks. But by that time, the branch network had expanded so large that it would be political unwise for the government to merge the RRBs with sponsor Banks.\n\nRecommendations of Narsimham Committee on RRBs The Narsimham Committee in 1990s also reiterated that the RRBs should be merged with the sponsor banks. By 1993, 172 of the 196 RRBs were recorded unprofitable. The paid up capital which was ` 25 Lakh at that time was not able to absorb the loan losses of most of the RRBs. The loan recovery was around 40%. The First Narasimham Committee recommended that the RRBs should also be permitted to engage in all types of banking business and should not be forced to restrict their operations to the target groups. The Narasimham committee also recommended that there should be mergers of the RRBs with their sponsor bank, BUT the “sponsor banks might decide whether to retain the identities of sponsored RRBs or to merge them with rural subsidiaries of commercial banks to be set up on the recommendation of the committee”. The first recommendation of letting the RRBs do all businesses was accepted by the government. Some measures were taken by the Reserve Bank of India also. It allowed the RRBs to relocate their branches if they were making losses at one location for more than 3 years. They were also allowed to finance the non-target groups to the extent not exceeding 40 percent of their incremental lending. This limit was subsequently enhanced to 60 percent in 1994. As a result, the RRBs diversified into a range of non- priority sector (NPS) advances, including jewel and deposit-linked loans, consumer loans and home loans Some efforts were done by NABARD with funding support of the Swiss Development Corporation (SDC). It took a number of HR and Organizational Development in these banks.\n\nTurnaround of RRBs The above discussion makes it clear that most RRB were making loss and had deviated from the original idea that had created them. But there were some profit making RRBs also. Some reforms led the rise in the number of the profit making RRBs but most of them were having a low credit deposit ratio. This was coupled with the decreasing percentage of loans to small and marginal farmers out of the total loans disbursed by the RRBs. The RRBs NPA level was high. In the early 2000s there was no prescribed CRAR (capital to risk weighted asset ratio) for the RRBs. In 2005, based upon the recommendation of an internal working group the RRBs were asked to maintain a capital to risk weighted asset ratio at 5% and over the period of time they were expected to align themselves to Basel I standards. However, the major reform was to merge the RRBs with the sponsor banks.\n\nNumber of Regional Rural Banks in India Year Dec-75 Dec-80 Dec-85 Mar-90 Mar-06 Mar-11 Mar-13 Mar-14 2015\n\nBanks 6 85 188 196 133 82 64 57 56\n\nThere were 196 RRBs sponsored by 27 SCBs and one State Cooperative Bank were operating in the country with a network of 14,484 branches spread over 523 districts as on March 31, 2005. The government started the process of consolidation and amalgamation in 2005, bringing the number down to 82 in 2010. As of March-end, 2011, the total number of RRBs stood at 82. This number fell to 64 in March 2013. As of March 2014, the number of RRBs has been reduced to 57. After the 2014 elections, the new NDA government has put hold on further amalgamation of the Regional Rural Banks. The focus of the new government is to improve their performance and exploring new avenues of investments in the same. Currently, there is a bill pending to amend the RRB Act which aims at increasing the pool of investors to tap capital for RRBs.\n\nPage\n\n15\n\nRegulation of RRBs Regional Rural Banks are regulated by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Please note that currently seven states viz. Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh Meghalaya and Puducherry, have state-level RRBs. Gujarat and Karnataka too have demanded formation of state level RRB. In case of West Bengal, the state Assembly took unanimous resolution in favour of State level RRB in the year 2004.\n\nAmalgamation\n\nCurrently, RRB's are going through a process of amalgamation and consolidation. 25 RRBs have been amalgamated in January 2013 into 10 RRBs. This counts 67 RRBs till 1st week of June 2013. On 31 March 2006, there were 133 RRBs (post-merger) covering 525 districts with a network of 14,494 branches. All RRBs were originally conceived as low cost institutions having a rural ethos, local feel and pro poor focus. However, within a very short time, most banks were making losses. The original assumptions as to the low cost nature of these institutions were belied. This may be again amalgamated in near future. At present there are 56 RRBs in India.\n\nLegal Existence and Protection RRB's are recognized by the law and they have legal significance.The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 Act No. 21 of 1976 [9 February 1976.] \"For the incorporation, regulation and winding up of Regional Rural Banks with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans and small entrepreneurs, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto\".\n\nList of RRBs Andhra Pradesh 1.

Co-operative banks are often created by persons belonging to the same local or professional community or sharing a common\n\ninterest. Co-operative banks generally provide their members with a wide range of banking and financial services (loans, deposits, banking accounts, etc). They provide limited banking products and are specialists in agriculture related products. Cooperative banks are the primary financiers of agricultural activities, some small-scale industries and self-employed workers. Co-operative banks function on the basis of \"no-profit no-loss\". Anyonya Co-operative Bank Limited (ACBL) is the first cooperative bank in India located in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat. The Co-operative Credit system consists of: a. Short-term agricultural credit institutions b. Long-term agricultural credit institutions c. Non-agricultural credit institutions The short-term agricultural credit institutions are in three categories: i. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies at the Village level Guidelines ii. Central Co-operative Banks at the District level iii. State Co-operative Banks at the State level The Long-term agricultural credit institutions are as under: 1. Primary Land Development Banks [at the base] 2. Central Land Development Banks [at the apex] Thus, the apex of the co-operative organization in a state is the State Bank to which Central Banks are affiliated. The Primary societies are mostly affiliated to the Central Banks. Some of them are grouped into local unions for the purposes of supervision. All of them are forbidden to lend to non-members except with the sanction of the Registrar of Co-operative societies.\n\nList of State Cooperative Banks: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16.\n\nAndaman and Nicobar State Co-operative Bank Andhra Pradesh State Co-operative Bank Arunachal Pradesh State Co-operative Apex Bank Assam Co-operative Apex Bank Bihar State Co-operative Bank Chandigarh State Co-operative Bank Chhattisgarh Rajya Sahakari Bank Maryadit Delhi State Co-operative Bank Goa State Co-operative Bank Gujarat State Co-operative Bank Haryana State Co-opertive Apex Bank Himachal Pradesh State Co-operative Bank Jammu and Kashmir State Co-operative Bank Jharkhand State Co-operative Bank Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank Kerala State Co-operative Bank\n\n17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32.\n\nMadhya Pradesh Rajya Sahakari Bank Maryadit Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Manipur State Co-operative Bank Meghalaya Co-operative Apex Bank Mizoram Co-operative Apex Bank Nagaland State Co-operative Bank Orissa State Co-operative Bank Pondichery State Co-operative Bank Punjab State Co-operative Bank Rajasthan State Co-operative Bank Sikkim State Co-operative Bank Tamil Nadu State Apex Co-operative Bank Tripura State Co-operative Bank Uttar Pradesh Co-operative Bank Uttarakhand State Co-operative Bank West Bengal State Co-operative Bank\n\n27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46. 47. 48. 49. 50. 51.\n\nKallappanna Awade Ichalkaranji Janata Sahakari Bank Kalyan Janata Sahakari Bank Karad Urban Co-operative Bank Mahanagar Co-operative Bank Mapusa Urban Co-operative Bank of Goa Nagar Urban Co-operative Bank Nasik Merchant's Co-operative Bank New India Co-operative Bank NKGSB Co-operative Bank Pravara Sahakari Bank Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Rupee Co-operative Bank Sangli Urban Co-operative Bank Saraswat Co-operative Bank Shamrao Vithal Co-operative Bank Solapur Janata Sahakari Bank Thane Bharat Sahakari Bank The Kapole Co-operative Bank TJSB Sahakari Bank Zoroastrian Co-operative Bank Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Bank Shikshak Sahakari Bank Akola Janata Commercial Co-operative Bank Akola Urban Co-operative Bank Khamgaon Urban Co-operative Bank MACO BANK\n\nList of Scheduled Urban Cooperative Banks in India:\n\nPage\n\n17\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26.\n\nThe Varachha co-operative Bank Ahmedabad Mercantile Co-Op Bank Kalupur Commercial Coop.

They have achieved many landmarks since their creation and have helped a normal rural Indian to feel empowered and secure. The story has not been smooth and has its share of procedural glitches and woes placed at various pockets.\n\nHistory of Cooperative Banking in India The historical roots of the Cooperative Movement in the world days back to days of misery and distress in Europe faced by common people who had little or no access to credit to fund their basic needs, in uncertain times. The idea spread when the continent was faced with economic turmoil which led large populations to live at subsistence level without any economic security. People were forced to poverty\n\nand deprivation. It was the idea of Hermann Schulze (1808-83) and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen (1818-88) which took shape as cooperative banks of today across the world. They started to promote the idea of easy availability of credit to small businesses and for the poor segment of society. It was similar to the many microfinance institutions which have become highly popular in developing economies of today. Although this helped spread cooperative movement in many parts of Europe, in British Isles it is came from the revivalist Christian movement and found high acceptance with working class and lower middle class segments of society. However, UK and Irish credit unions in 20th century were inspired by US credit unions which in-turn owe their emergence to Canadian adaptations of the German cooperative banking concept. These movements were supported by governments of the respective countries. This success was achieved due to the failure of the commercial banks to fund and support the needs of small business owners and ordinary people who were outside the formal banking net. Cooperative banks helped overcome the vital market imperfections and serviced the poorer layers of society. Indian Cooperative Banks was also born out of distress prevalent in Indian society.  The Cooperative Credit Societies Act, 1904 led to the formation of Cooperative Credit Societies in both rural and urban areas. The act was based on recommendations of Sir Frederick Nicholson (1899) and Sir Edward Law (1901). Their ideas in turn were based on the pattern of Raiffeisen and Schulze respectively.  The Cooperative Societies Act of 1912, further gave recognition to the formation of non-credit societies and the central cooperative organizations.  In independent India, with the onset of planning, the cooperative organizations gained more leverage and role with the continued governmental support.  Machlagan Committee in 1915, highlighted the deficiencies of in cooperative societies which seeped-in due to lack of proper education to the masses. He also laid down the importance of Central Assistance by the Government to support the movement.  The Royal Commission on Agriculture 1928, enumerated the importance of education of members/staff for effective implementation of cooperative movement.  Saraiya Committee, in 1945, further recommended the setting up of a Cooperative Training College in every state and a Cooperative Training Institute for Advanced Study and Research at the Central level.  Central Committee for Cooperative Training in 1953, constituted by RBI for establishing Regional Training Centres.  Rural Credit Survey Committee, 1954 was the first committee formed till then to first delve into the problems of Rural credit and other financial issues of rural society. The cooperative movement and banking structures soon spread and resonated with the unexpressed needs of the rural Indian and small scale businesses. Since, 1950s, they have come a long way to support and provide assistance in activities like credit, banking, production, processing, distribution/marketing, housing, warehousing, irrigation, transport, textiles, dairy, sugar etc. to households.\n\nExtent of Cooperative Banking Indian cooperative structures are one of the largest such networks in the world with more than 200 million members. It has about 67% penetration in villages and fund 46% of the total rural credit. It also stands for 36% of the total distribution of rural fertilizers and 28% of rural fair price shops.\n\nStructure of Cooperative Banking in India The structure of cooperative network in India can be divided into 2 broad segments1. Urban Cooperative Banks 2. Rural Cooperatives. 1. Urban Cooperatives Urban Cooperatives can be further divided into scheduled and non-scheduled. Both the categories are further divided into multi-state and single-state. Majority of these banks fall in the non-scheduled and single-state category.  Banking activities of Urban Cooperative Banks are monitored by RBI.  Registration and Management activities are managed by Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS). These RCS operate in singlestate and Central RCS (CRCS) operate in multiple state. 2. Rural Cooperatives The rural cooperatives are further divided into short-term and long-term structures. The short-term cooperative banks are three tiered operating in different states. These are State Cooperative Banks- They operate at the apex level in states  District Central Cooperative Banks-They operate at the district levels  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies-They operate at the village or grass-root level. Likewise, the long-term structures are further divided into –  State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (SCARDS)- These operate at state-level.  Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBS)-They operate at district/block level. The rural banking cooperatives have a complex monitoring structure as they have a dual control which has led to many problems. A Forum called State Level Task Force on Cooperative Urban Banks (TAFCUB) has been set-up to look into issues related to duality in control.  All banking activities are regulated by a shared arrangement between RBI and NABARD.  All management and registration activities are managed by RCS.\n\nPage\n\n18\n\nCooperative Banks-Irritants and Future Trends A cooperative bank is an institution which is owned by its members. They are the culmination of efforts of people of same professional or other community which have common and shared interests, problems and aspirations. They cater to a services like loans, banking, deposits etc. like commercial banks but widely differ in their values and governance structures. They are usually democratic set-ups where the board of members are democratically elected with each member entitled to one vote each. In India, they are supervised and controlled by the official banking authorities and thus have to abide by the banking regulations prevalent in the country. The basic rules, regulations and values may differ amongst nations but they have certain common features:  Customer-owned  Democratic structures  Profits are mainly pooled to form reserves while some amount is distributed to members  Involved in community development  Foster financial inclusion by bringing banking to the doorstep of the lowest segment of society\n\nThese banks are small financial institutions which are governed by regulations like Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and Banking Laws Cooperative Societies Act, 1965. They operate both in urban and rural areas under different structural organisations. Their functions are decided by the level at which they operate and the type of people they cater to. They greatly differ from the commercial banking entities.  These are established under specific acts of cooperative societies operating in different states unlike mainstream commercial banks which are mainly joint-stock companies.  They have a tiered network with a bank at each level of state, district and rural. The state-level bank forms the apex authority.  Not all sections of banking regulation act are applicable to cooperative banks  The ultimate motive is community participation, benefit and growth as against profit-maximisation for commercial banks.\n\nMajor irritants in the functioning of the Cooperative Banks \n\nThe duality in control by RCS of a state as ‘Cooperation’ is a state subject. However financial regulatory control by RBI has led to many troubles as there is ambiguity in power structure as there is no clear demarcation.  Patchy growth of cooperative societies across the map of India. It is said these have grown maximally in states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu whereas the other parts of India don’t have a heightened presence.  The state partnership has led to excessive state control and interference. This has eroded the autonomous characters of many of these.  Dormant membership has made them moribund as there is a lack of active members and lack of professional attitude.  Their main focus being credit so they have reduced to borrower-driven entities and majority of members are nominal and don’t enjoy voting rights.  Credit recovery is weak especially in rural areas and it has sustainability crisis in some pockets.  There is a lack of risk management systems and lack of basic standardised banking models.  There is a widening gap between the level of skills and the increasing computerisation of banks. The government needs to have a serious look into the issues as they did not show an impressive growth in the last 100 years.\n\nDEVELOPMENT BANKS In the field of industrial finance, the concept of development bank is of recent origin. In a country like India, the emergence of development banking is a post-independence phenomenon. In the Western countries, however, development banking had a long period of evolution. The origin of development banking may be traced to the establishment of ‘Society General Pour Favoriser I’ lndustrie Nationale’ in Belgium in 1822. But the notable institution was the ‘Credit Mobiliser’ of France, established in 1852, which acted as industrial financier. In 1920, Japan established the Industrial Bank of Japan to cater to the financial needs of her industrial development. In the post-war era, the Industrial Development Bank of Canada (1944), the Finance Corporation for Industry Ltd. (FCI) and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Ltd. (ICFC) of England (1945), etc., were established as modern development banks to provide term loans to industry. In 1966, the U.K. Government set up the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (IRC). In India, the first development bank called the Industrial Finance Corporation of India was established in 1948.\n\nDefinition of Development Bank: There is no precise definition of development bank. William Diamond and Shirley Bosky consider industrial finance and development corporations as ‘development banks’ Fundamentally a development bank is a term lending institution. Development bank is essentially a multi-purpose financial institution with a broad development outlook. A development bank may, thus, be defined as a financial institution concerned with providing all types of financial assistance (medium as well as long term) to business units, in the form of loans, underwriting, investment and guarantee operations, and promotional activities — economic development in general, and industrial development, in particular. In short, a development bank is a development- oriented bank.\n\nFeatures of a Development Bank: Following are the main characteristic features of a development bank: 1. It is a specialised financial institution. 2. It provides medium and long term finance to business units. 3. Unlike commercial banks, it does not accept deposits from the public. 4. It is not just a term-lending institution. It is a multi-purpose financial institution. 5. It is essentially a development-oriented bank. Its primary object is to promote economic development by promoting investment and entrepreneurial activity in a developing economy. It encourages new and small entrepreneurs and seeks balanced regional growth. 6. It provides financial assistance not only to the private sector but also to the public sector undertakings. 7. It aims at promoting the saving and investment habit in the community. 8. It does not compete with the normal channels of finance, i.e., finance already made available by the banks and other conventional financial institutions. Its major role is of a gap-filler, i. e., to fill up the deficiencies of the existing financial facilities. 9. Its motive is to serve public interest rather than to make profits. It works in the general interest of the nation.\n\nPage\n\n19\n\nEXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF INDIA (EXIM BANK) Export-Import Bank of India is the premier export finance institution of the country, established in 1982 under the Export-Import Bank of India Act 1981. Shri Yaduvendra Mathur- Chairman and Managing Director Organization Exim Bank is managed by a Board of Directors, which has representatives from the Government, Reserve Bank of India, Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India, a financial institution, public sector banks, and the business community.

K. Batra (Deputy Managing Director) (IDBI) was established on 1 July 1964 under an Act of Parliament as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India. In 16 February 1976, the ownership of IDBI was transferred to the Government of India and it was made the principal financial institution for coordinating the activities of institutions engaged in financing, promoting and developing industry in the country. Although Government shareholding in the Bank came down below 100% following IDBI’s public issue in July 1995, the former continues to be the major shareholder. IDBI provides financial assistance, both in rupee and foreign currencies, for green-field projects as also for expansion, modernisation and diversification purposes. In the wake of financial sector reforms unveiled by the government since 1992, IDBI also provides indirect financial assistance by way of refinancing of loans extended by State-level financial institutions and banks and by way of rediscounting of bills of exchange arising out of sale of indigenous machinery on deferred payment terms. IDBI has played a pioneering role, particularly in the perform era (1964–91), in catalysing broad based industrial development in the country in keeping with its Government-ordained ‘development banking’ charter. Narasimam committee recommends that IDBI should give up its direct financing functions and concentrate only in promotional and refinancing role. But this recommendation was rejected by the government. Later RBI constituted a committee under the chairmanship of S.H. Khan to examine the concept of development financing in the changed global challenges. This committee is the first to recommend the concept of universal banking. The committee wanted the development financial institution to diversify its activity. It recommended harmonising the role of development financing and banking activities by getting away from the conventional distinction between commercial banking and developmental banking. In September 2003, IDBI diversified its business domain further by acquiring the entire shareholding of Tata Finance Limited in Tata Home finance Ltd., signalling IDBI’s foray into the retail finance sector. The fully owned housing finance subsidiary has since been renamed ‘IDBI Home finance Limited’. In view of the signal changes in the operating environment, following initiation of reforms since the early 1990s, Government of India has decided to transform IDBI into a commercial bank without eschewing its secular development finance obligations. The migration to the new business model of commercial banking, with its gateway to low-cost current, savings bank deposits, would help overcome most of the limitations of the current business model of development finance while simultaneously enabling it to diversify its client/ asset base. Towards this end, the IDB (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act 2003 was passed by Parliament in December 2003. The Act provides for repeal of IDBI Act, corporatisation of IDBI (with majority Government holding; current share: 58.47%) and transformation into a commercial bank. The provisions of the Act have come into force from 2 July 2004 in terms of a Government Notification to this effect. The Notification facilitated formation, incorporation and registration of Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd. as a company under the Companies Act, 1956 and a deemed Banking Company under the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and helped in obtaining requisite regulatory and statutory clearances, including those from RBI. IDBI would commence banking business in accordance with the provisions of the new Act in addition to the business being transacted under IDBI Act, 1964 from 1 October 2004, the ‘Appointed Date’ notified by the Central Government. IDBI Bank, with which the parent IDBI was merged, was a new generation Bank. The Pvt Bank was the fastest growing banking company in India. The bank was pioneer in adapting to policy of first mover in tier 2 cities. The Bank has one of the highest productivity per employee in Indian banking industry.\n\nPage\n\n20\n\nNATIONAL BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (NABARD) Chairman- Dr. Harsh Kumar Bhanwala NABARD is an apex development bank in India having headquarters based in Mumbai (Maharashtra) and other branches are all over the country.
