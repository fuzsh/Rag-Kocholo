        "text": "By Sean Bradley\n\n© Grand Slams Facebook\n\n(November 29, 2010) Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic captured the Barclay’s ATP World Tour Finals Championship, beating Indian-Belarusian partners Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi 7-6(6), 6-4 in London’s O2 Arena on Sunday.\n\nThe Canadian-Serbian partners won their seventh title of the season, including the championships at Roland Garros and ATP Monte Carlo. The second-ranked team first had to beat the number one-seeded Bryan Brothers in the semi-finals, 6-3, 3-6, 12-10.\n\nNestor said about the match, “It's our last match against them. So it's good timing. We've had a lot of great battles over the years. Today was a typical match between the two teams where, you know, it's very evenly matched. We were fortunate to win in the end.”\n\nUnfortunate as it might be, the team, which has been a challenge for the doubles-dominate Bryan Brothers, has decided to disband after three-years together, Nestor teaming up with finals-opponent Max Mirnyi and Zimonjic joining Frenchman Michael Llodra.\n\nNestor said, “ You know, obviously too bad that we're not continuing. But at the same time, you know, we had a great run.”\n\nIn Sunday’s game, Bhupathi and Mirnyi lead early at 5-3, but Zimonjic and Nestor took advantage of failed conversion points, gaining the first set and breaking the other team early in the second set.\n\nBhupathi and Mirnyi put up a good fight, Bhupathi stating in his post-game interview, “We played well. We had our chances. We positioned ourselves, even though they were playing really well, to win the first set. With teams like this, you have to take your chance when you have it. We didn't. Unfortunately came out on the losing end.”\n\nOf the match, Nestor said, “It's nice to beat a team when they're playing at the top of their game, like we were. Two teams that are confident coming into a good match, it's good tennis. It's nice to be able to win a match like that.”\n\nZimonjic finished, saying, “I thought today to begin the match, I thought Mahesh was playing really unbelievable with returns and some volleys that he's been hitting. It was very similar match what we had in the round robin, very close, not too many chances on each other's serves. We were, I have to say, lucky to win the first set in the tiebreaker.”\n\nNext year should be a very competitive year for ATP Doubles."
