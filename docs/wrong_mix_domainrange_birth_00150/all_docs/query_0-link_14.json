But as John McEnroe’s U.S. team kept their supporters on tenterhooks against the Czech Republic under the famous Los Angeles landscape, defending champions Australia moved safely into the semifinals with a 3-2 win over Germany. Meanwhile, Brazil and Spain also booked their places in the last four with victories on home soil. Like all good dramas, the semifinals could not have been determined in more different circumstances. As John Newcombe enjoyed the luxury of an unassailable 3-0 in Adelaide, it was de ja vu for McEnroe, as his team fought back from 2-1 down to defeat the Czechs— just as they did against Zimbabwe in the previous round. And as Spain carried out a crushing 4-1 victory over Yevgeny Kafelnikov and his Russian counterparts in Malaga, Fernando Meligeni helped lead Brazil to a last-gasp 3-2 win over the Slovak Republic in Rio. With six of the current leaders in the ATP Champions Race 2000 all in Davis Cup action, and Mark Philippoussis on the physio bench, the big guns were all out for Davis Cup glory. But even with the might of Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras on the American team, the Czechs did everything they could to upset the form-books. After Jiri Novak played what he described as one of the best matches of his life to inflict a straight sets defeat on Sampras in the opening rubber, it was left to Agassi to settle the score against Slava Dosedel. But as Novak teamed up with David Rikl to record a shock win over Alex O’Brien and current doubles No. 1 Jared Palmer to give the Czechs a 2-1 lead, an upset looked on the cards until Agassi once again came to the rescue by handing Novak only his third Davis Cup Davis Cup Review, Page 2➔ ATP Tour Announces New Positions in Television, Internet and New Media The ATP Tour, governing body of the international men’s professional tennis circuit, announced several significant staff changes as part of its new direction for the 21st Century.
