        "text": "Because nothing generates quite so much fantastic photoage as Davis Cup. You know it to be true.\n\nsorry but ive to say i fcking won davis cup!omg\n\nPretty sure I could snap him like a twig. A twig.\n\nMarin’s left arm makes a desperate bid for freedom.\n\nGet the man a Big Mac, a big drink and a big vuvuzela.\n\n“Did I leave the gas on …?”\n\nThis is not the face I’ve missed.\n\nThis is the face I’ve missed.\n\nPut it away, Nole. Or I will come to Serbia and show you where to … never mind.\n\n“Mr. President. What the hell.”\n\nNothing beats a good old-fashioned Serbian love huddle.\n\nEduardo Schwank looking in no way ridiculous.\n\nEduardo Schwank being no way ridiculous.\n\nKind of impossible to dislike Gael when he finds himself on this planet long enough to win a big match.\n\nTipsy wants a cuddle. No-one on this earth can blame him.\n\nThey shoot horses, don’t they?\n\nPremature celebrating.\n\nYeah, Youzh better run.\n\nHaving beaten Spain at tennis, France take them on at the art of the manly hug. And win.\n\nHave him caramelised and sent to my room.\n\nNole Major and Nole Minor.\n\nLook who showed up to ‘help’.\n\n“I’m a little lamb who’s lost in the woods …”\n\nKolya contemplates the many tragedies of life.\n\nShamil contemplates finding another job.\n\nYou’re not helping.\n\nHomoerotic celebrations: must try harder.\n\nI have to say, this one got a bit short-changed for me this weekend; I was focused on Argentina and France. Much has been said and written about the political background to this one, and the sad behaviour of some fans in Split. But at the end of the day, the players all showed up, did their jobs, played some fantastic tennis and treated each other and the spectators with respect. So that’s what I’m going to hastily honour.\n\nNenad Zimonjic and Janko Tipsarevic, or as I mentally refer to them ‘Errol Flynn and Crazy Eyes’ won their doubles rubber.\n\nMarin once again veered wildly between thrilling …\n\n… and enormously disappointing.\n\nMarkko Djokovic was there as a reserve for no adequately explained reason.\n\nAnd Nole did the absolute business, winning both his matches to put Serbia into their first ever Davis Cup semi-finals.\n\nA fine effort, but less clothing and much more wetness required for full marks, Serbia.\n\nR1 – N.DJOKOVIC (SRB) def. I.LJUBICIC (CRO)\n\n7-6(3) 6-4 6-1\n\nR2 – M.CILIC (CRO) def. V.TROICKI (SRB)\n\n6-4 7-5 6-2\n\nR3 – J.TIPSAREVIC / N.ZIMONJIC (SRB) def. M.CILIC / I.DODIG (CRO)\n\n6-3 6-2 6-4\n\nR4 – N.DJOKOVIC (SRB) def. M.CILIC (CRO)\n\n6-3 6-3 6-2\n\nR5 – J.TIPSAREVIC (SRB) def. A.VEIC (CRO)\n\n6-2 7-6(5)\n\nI can’t believe it’s time for my final Davis Cup picspam. God, I love this event so much. It should be played every weekend.\n\n“My work here is done,” he seems to say.\n\nHappiness is a champagne-soaked Belgian.\n\nI’m a sucker for behind-the-curtain photos.\n\nI’m also a sucker for Jo.\n\nBack to the dustbin of tennis history with you, Thiemo de Bakker.\n\nAllez Les Bleus.\n\nMurray searches for an escape hatch to another country.\n\nPole dance.\n\nThat’s pretty much how I reacted to the GB-Poland results.\n\nExcept without the laughing. And my hair’s not as shiny.\n\nIf there was a Crazy Cup, Serbia would win it hands down.\n\nI feel as if I’ve interrupted Robin’s dance routine.\n\nGratuitous ass shot #1.\n\nGratuitous ass shot #2.\n\nBless you, Somdev.\n\nYuki’s eyebrows really deserve a picspam of their own.\n\nWell, the two semifinals may have been clinched, but pretty much everybody else in the World Group is doing their best to keep it interesting. Apart from Serbia, who have now beaten Uzbekistan 3-0 to stay in the World Group, courtesy of Zimonjic and Tipsarevic, a maiden doubles pairing who beat Istomin and and Dustov 62 63 62\n\nSuch soft, shiny hair …\n\nDespite the best efforts of Melo and Sa, the Lapentti bros, Nico and Giovanni, gave Ecuador a 2-1 lead over Brazil with a five-set doubles victory. I’m torn on this one. There’s hotties on both sides of the net, but Nico says he might not retire if Ecuador stay in the World Group, and I do love me some Nico …\n\nItaly pulled off a bit of a shock today after Federer was benched for the doubles, leading Wawrinka and Chiudinelli to fly the flag.\n\nThey have consequently learned an important lesson: underestimate Potito Starace at your peril. The weaselly one teamed up with Simone Bolelli to nick the doubles rubber 64 62 76(3).\n\nOf course, one of them will have to beat Roger Federer to win the tie, but whatever. Enjoy your moment, guys. Also looking good in blue were Les Bleus, ably represented by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Michael Llodra, who beat Thiemo de Bakker and Igor Sijsling in four sets 63 36 76 64.\n\nLlodra nearly comes a cropper.\n\nNot sure if they’re playing or celebrating, to be honest. Either works.\n\nSweden also notched up a 2-1 lead, with Soderling and Lindstedt beating Hanescu and Horia Tecau (apparently a thing) in straight sets to give them the edge after Hanescu’s victory over Vinciguerra yesterday.\n\nThe Ukraine managed to pull a point back, beating Belgium in the doubles for 2-1, and Austria are currently a break up in the first set of the doubles match with Chile, which they need to win to stay in the World Group.\n\nIn “I dream of the World Group but could never get there”, Great Britain are facing an uphill struggle against Poland. Yeah … Poland. Murray, who continues to struggle with his wrist injury, stepped up for the doubles with Ross Hutchins, but they lost to Frystenberg and Matkowski 75 36 63 62. This basically means Poland are going to win, unless Dan Evans – ranked 302 in the world – can somehow win a match tomorrow. Which will not happen. Bugger it.\n\nSays it all."
