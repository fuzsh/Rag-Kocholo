        "text": "I had a chance to sit down with Nenad Zimonjić at Washington’s CITI Open, a tournament he first attended in 1999 and has subsequently won twice (2011 and 2013). While we spoke, the Serbian doubles specialist was watching the quarter-final between Dodig/Melo and Lopez/Mirnyi, sharing observations about tactics and execution with both Marcin Matkowski and his trainer Vlade Kaplarević. Naturally, that’s where our conversation started. A version of this interview was published in Serbian by B92.\n\nAM: How often do you get to scout your potential opponents like this and what kinds of things do you look for?\n\nNZ: Any kind of detail: who is struggling with which shot, what they try to do on the big points, if there are any specific plays they use, where they like to serve, where they like to return—stuff like that.\n\nAM: Do you get a chance to do this at every tournament?\n\nNZ: Not at every tournament. Sometimes, you can watch on the TV screens in the locker- room or lounge; sometimes, you have indoor events where you can just go to the court and sit, which is quite convenient. Here, I just finished my practice and they’re playing; so, I don’t mind coming out for a little bit.\n\nAM: If you didn’t have a chance to watch them live, would you go on YouTube the night before to look for clips, or is this viewing sort of a bonus?\n\nNZ: No, I wouldn’t—because I know all of them quite well and I’ve played against all of them many times. So, only if it’s a team I’ve never heard of or never played against, then I try to do a little research and get as much information as I can.\n\nAfter a tightly-contested match, it was the Roland Garros champions who prevailed, 10-7, in a super tiebreak. Although Zimonjić had faced the current #3 team with other partners over the past three seasons, Saturday’s semifinal was the first time for the Polish-Serbian duo. It didn’t go well: the straight-set loss to Dodig and Melo included the first bagel set for “Ziki” in over four years. Their previous round quarterfinal against the Colombian pair of Cabal and Farah, which seemed headed for a straight-set win, got unnecessarily complicated after an intervention by Chair Umpire Paula Vieira Souza. So, I had to ask.\n\nAM: What happened on your serve at the end of the second-set tiebreak?\n\nNZ: We played the point: I made the first serve, then Marcin played a volley; after that, Cabal was at the net and he tried to reflex it. Then, [just as Matkowski was making what appeared to be a winning shot] an overrule came from the chair umpire. She called the serve out—and it was way too late to do that after three [additional] shots. There’s no way you do this—we’d already played the point. Then, I made a double-fault there and it directly affected the set…\n\nAM: Since there isn’t “Hawk-Eye” on that court for a challenge, did you think of calling the supervisor?\n\nNZ: You can’t change anything; it’s the umpire’s call and that’s it. But if they do an overrule, they should do it way earlier—right away. She said she was waiting to see if the line judge was going to call it. Why wait? Even if it’s the same call, you should say it out loud.\n\nAM: Even before the season started, you had a setback with Michael Llodra’s injury and surgery. Then, Qureshi, your first substitute partner, didn’t work out. It’s been better with Matkowski, and you guys are #7 in the doubles race, but you haven’t won a title yet. How would you assess your season so far?\n\nNZ: Like you said, it was unpredictable. It was something that I was hoping for: to play with Mika again after some time, because I thought we played really well together; and he was going to play only doubles, so that was a perfect opportunity for me. But then, it was unlucky that he needed the surgery; he’s been out since then and I don’t know if he’s been practicing a bit, whether he wants to come back or not. He’s been doing a little TV commentary and some other things, so we’ll see what’s going to happen.\n\nAt that point, the beginning of December, all the teams were set up; so, the only guys who I could actually ask were those in a partnership with a singles player, because that’s easier to get out of. Qureshi was one of the guys, so I asked him to play. I had to change the side I was playing and it didn’t start very well. I was expecting more from that, to be honest; it wasn’t a long time, but I felt like it was better to switch early… With Matkowski, I started playing at Indian Wells and that worked out well from the beginning—we started by making the semifinals there… In the past, Marcin didn’t have much success at Wimbledon, so making the quarterfinals, losing to [eventual champions] Rojer and Tecau, was his best result.\n\nAM: Looking back at last year’s successes, being the #2 team for most of the year, do you have any second thoughts about the decision to end things with Nestor?\n\nNZ: No, not really. Maybe [under different circumstances] I would have thought more after the US Open about what I wanted to do, whether I want to continue or not. But we didn’t have the communication that I wanted on the court: talking about tactics or things that we should work on, stuff like this. And the opportunity to play with Mika—somebody I’ve played with in the past, is four years younger than me, and wants to play only doubles—made it a very easy decision for me to make… I think it was good that Danny and I played together last year, but for this one I definitely needed a change.\n\nAM: Davis Cup didn’t go very well. What do you think went wrong there? With Novak pulling out and Tipsarević unable to play, was it kind of a combination of factors? How much did Troicki’s Wimbledon loss (to Pospisil, after being up two sets) weigh on him?\n\nNZ: He knows best how it was. I think he was very confident, and very close—one set away—to making his best result at Wimbledon: quarter-finals. So, he was playing really, really, well and it’s a pity he didn’t make it. Then again, he’d played many tournaments in a row and the conditions [in Buenos Aires] were for sure something he doesn’t like: very slow clay. They used that to their advantage, which is normal, and they chose it perfectly—it was much better for them.\n\nWhat affected us there is that Viktor didn’t win that singles match on the first day—he had a chance, being up two sets to love and kind of cruising through the match…. So, that affected the next day: that he lost, that it wasn’t one-all, and that he was physically a little tired. These guys played unbelievably: [Leonardo] Mayer was on fire in the singles the first day, and also in the doubles, and [Carlos] Berlocq played really well, too. We basically didn’t have any chance. Of course, if Novak was there, it would have been completely different. Then again, if Viktor had won that first day, it would have been a completely different doubles match. So, it’s a pity; but they were a better team & they deserved it.\n\nAM: With 2016 being an Olympic year, it makes Davis Cup even more complicated. Will Team Serbia be able to give a full effort?\n\nNZ: Well, I don’t know. I’ve always played Davis Cup—I don’t remember when I last missed it. So, for me, it doesn’t really matter; I’ll try to help the team. We’ll see in September which opponent we’ll draw in the first round and about the schedule— everything changes because of the Olympics. Hopefully, we’ll play at home, which make things a little easier.\n\nAM: Four men are in contention for the ITF presidency and they’ve each proposed changes to the Davis Cup schedule & format. Do you have any thoughts on what could be changed to increase player participation and improve the event?\n\nNZ: I think Davis Cup takes a lot out of you—first, the days of preparation and then the tie itself, over three days. What could be changed is to play best-of-three sets instead; that would make a big difference to the players participating. Also, we could have two additional players on the team: to have five or six guys that you could substitute. That would make it much easier on the top guys, if they decide to play, because then they know they might only have to play one match. Also, maybe it could be played in two days, like Fed Cup is doing.\n\nAM: At least one candidate has suggested playing all of them in one location, like the World Cup. What do you think about doing away with home-and-away ties?\n\nNZ: This is a tradition that I think should be kept, so the countries that don’t have big professional tournaments get to see top players. This is very nice—and good for sports. Then again, maybe every few years, like the Olympics, we could alternate and have a world championships somewhere, playing a format like they used to do [at the World Team Cup] in Düsseldorf. That was a good competition.\n\nAM: Over the years, you’ve played with so many greats of the game. What do you cherish about playing with guys like Santoro, Paes, or Nestor himself? What did you learn from veteran players in your 20s & early 30s?\n\nNZ: Every time I had a chance to play with a top guy, it was a huge experience. The first one like that who asked me to play was Wayne Ferreira, then one of the “Woodies” asked me to practice. Playing against them or playing with them, you always try to learn something, to improve as a player by seeing what they do better. From each partner, you can learn something new and use it for yourself.\n\nFor me, playing with Henman in Monte Carlo and winning my first Masters series title [in 2004] was like that. It was really nice. Different personalities, different styles—that’s what’s made me a better player now. I’ve played different sides, with more or less aggressive players, lefty, righty, players with more feel, somebody who doesn’t serve big (so you have to be ready with your volleys)—everything. Over the years, it helped me a lot that I played with many different partners.\n\nAM: In most cases, do you feel like you were learning primarily through your own observations? Were any of your partners more actively mentoring or advising you?\n\nNZ: Yes, sometimes. As partners, you try to help each other—saying some tactical or technical things. Then, through this, you learn from them, seeing what they are doing when they’re playing points. If you make some mistakes, then you talk about it and try not to do the same again. So, these are the things that help you a lot as a player. Sometimes, when you’re not sure what to do, you can even ask, “What do you think? What play should we use?” This is where [communication] can be very helpful.\n\nAM: When you’re playing on the ATP tour, unless you’re with Nestor, you’re usually partnered with guys about five years younger. But when you’re playing Davis Cup, some of your partners are significantly younger—for example, Filip Krajinović. In a case like that, when there’s more than a fifteen-year difference, are you more aware of passing on lessons?\n\nNZ: For sure. In all the Davis Cup matches, I’m going to be the leader of the team because I’m more comfortable in doubles and I can help them a lot. So, I have to think tactically— knowing what they’re capable of, what they can do—and try to encourage them to play their style but, at the same time, to play in a way that I can help them.\n\nAM: The US Open is not your most successful Slam. Do you go into it thinking differently because of that? Is there anything particular you’ll do to prepare for the North American hard-court swing this year?\n\nNZ: First, it’s a big adjustment: the courts are quicker, the balls bounce much higher after grass… So, it’s a huge adjustment and you have to be ready for it. The second thing is the weather: it’s extremely hot and can be humid here and in New York; so, practicing in these conditions is something you try to focus on. The reason why you come a little earlier to the tournaments and use this [Washington] tournament as great preparation for Montreal and Cincinnati is that there, we have a “bye,” so we’re going to play a tough first match, whoever goes through. The cut-offs [at the Masters] are extremely tough and these guys will already have played one match. Every match that we play here is beneficial for us—and, so far, it’s going well.\n\nAlso, I would say Marcin feels most comfortable on hard courts and indoors; so, this part of the season now should be good for us. I’ve had success at these tournaments everywhere but the US Open. I felt like I’ve been playing good at the US Open but was just a little unlucky—last year, for instance, with the heat. So, I can’t be unsatisfied with the way I’ve been playing there—I just have to make sure that I work hard and come there ready. Marcin had his best [Slam] result in New York, where he made the finals. So, he knows he can play well there. We’ll see.\n\nAM: Are you guys actively thinking about the World Tour Finals in London?\n\nNZ: For sure, that’s one of the goals. We’re #7 in the race, even though we started in Indian Wells. Then, there are some new teams… Right now, you can say that four teams have already qualified: Dodig and Melo, the Bryans, the Italians [Bolelli and Fognini ], plus Tecau & Rojer.\n\nCurrently, fewer than two thousand points separate the doubles teams ranked 5-12 in the race; so, it’ll be a fight to the end of the season for the final four spots. In Montreal, Matkowski and Zimonjić are the fifth seeds and will play the winners of a marquee first-round match between Australians Hewitt and Kyrgios and Frenchmen Monfils and Tsonga.\n\nI had an opportunity to sit down with doubles specialist Nenad Zimonjić at the start of the Citi Open in Washington. Returning to competitive play after a month’s rest, the Serb was in a reflective mood while discussing his rivalry with the Bryan brothers, his numerous partners in recent years, and the ITF’s recent decision to suspend his Davis Cup teammate Viktor Troicki for eighteen months. (An edited Serbian version of the interview appeared on the B92 website.)\n\nAs a winner of multiple Grand Slam titles, including back-to back Wimbledon victories in 2008 and ‘09, Zimonjić is fairly well known in tennis circles. Together with Canada’s Daniel Nestor, he wrestled the Bryan brothers for the top spot in men’s doubles for three years, winning the year-end ATP championships in 2008 (Shanghai) and 2010 (London). He has also won four major titles in mixed doubles, two with Slovene veteran and frequent partner Katarina Srebotnik. While not known for his singles career, he has played solo as recently as this winter’s Davis Cup tie with Belgium and lists a 2004 win over Andre Agassi, then ranked #6 in the world, among his achievements.\n\nPerhaps less appreciated outside of the Balkans is the role Zimonjić serves—part older brother, part elder statesman—within the Serbian tennis community. Given his compatriot’s success in singles, it’s little surprise that the first name that comes to most people’s minds when they think of Serbian tennis is Novak Djoković. Nevertheless, at 37 years old and with 49 doubles titles to his name, “Ziki” is widely regarded as the stalwart of Team Serbia. Not only has he appeared in 44 Davis Cup ties but he also possesses at least one trophy to mark every year since 1999 (and the range of experiences and insight that comes with that kind of longevity). Though Djoković is the player now most relied upon to bring points in their Davis Cup clashes, Zimonjić remains a strong presence both on and off the court. His effect on younger players can be observed in any number of ways: a striking recent example was his steadying influence on the talented but streaky Ilija Bozoljac in their dramatic win over the Bryan brothers in Boise this spring.\n\nLast week, it was my turn to listen and learn.\n\n***\n\nAM: The last time you played here, two years ago, you and Michael Llodra won the title. Does having won a tournament before affect or motivate you in any particular way?\n\nNZ: It’s always nice to come back to the places where you’ve played well, especially defending a title. I don’t find it to be a pressure—it’s more like you remember that you played really well, you have good memories, and that can help you in the results. Then again, it’s been two years now, since we had Olympic Games last summer. But I’ve always had good experiences here in Washington; I remember playing well most of the time, so hopefully we can do the same this year.\n\nAM: You’ve played two great matches against the Bryan Brothers this year with a lot on the line and won both. What does it mean to beat the most accomplished team in doubles history? Will you miss them here this week or are you and other players kind of glad when they’re not in the draw?\n\nNZ: Not really. I enjoy playing against the best—this is why I compete, this is why I train every day: because I want to play the best on the biggest stages. So, if you meet them in the finals, that’s the best possible thing. In my career, I’ve had a lot of matches against the Bryans and some of them were really big matches—some I lost, some I won. They’re probably going to go down as the most successful team of all time and it’s nice that I’ve had the chance to play against them with various partners on various occasions.\n\nWhat they’ve achieved this year is amazing, really. Actually, it started from winning the Olympic Games—from that point on, I thought they played incredibly well. They were so consistent, they had really great results, and they won a tournament they’ve never won (and which means a lot to them), Indian Wells. They had chances in the past, but they didn’t make it, and it took them a while. But now they can say that they’ve won everything that you can win in doubles. Obviously, they want to keep winning as much as they can—and everybody on tour wants the same thing. So, for me to play them is always a big challenge and it’s always nice to compete against the best.\n\nAM: One difference between the Bryan Brothers and other teams is that they have worked together for so long. Even if they weren’t twins, such a long-term partnership is an advantage. What have been the challenges for you over the past year or so playing with so many partners? Have you learned anything new about yourself and how you work in this period?\n\nNZ: Obviously, it helps when you play with the same partner. When you practice a lot together, you’re going to improve. You’re going to have ups and downs, but you get to know each other and find a way to help each other—that’s the advantage the Bryans have. They work extremely hard. Then again, there are a lot of changes in doubles. So, where they benefit the most is the beginning of the year, because a lot of guys are just getting to know each other. This is where they have a head start—they get ahead of everybody and it’s difficult to catch them.\n\nBy playing with many different partners, I got the chance to improve my game. Sometimes playing a different side, different styles—that helped me to become a better player. But, my most successful partnership was with Daniel [Nestor], and that’s when we were there with the Bryans. For the three years we played together, it came down to the last match of the season to decide who was going to be number one. The first year, we finished #1; the second year, they finished #1; then, the third year, they finished first and we tied for third. It was very competitive. We played against them, I believe, fifteen matches and won nine of those; so, head-to-head, we had better results. But, at the end, we decided to split.\n\nThen, I thought I had a good partnership with Mika. It took a while to get going, probably because we were expecting a little bit more from ourselves. We knew that we were capable of playing really well, but it took time because he is also focused on his singles and we didn’t have much time to practice. Unlike the Bryans, who practice day-in, day-out and can even play points in practice, with Mika, I can count on the figures of one hand how many times we played practice points against somebody. So, this is something that was missing.\n\nWe stopped because they were expecting their third child during Wimbledon and I couldn’t really take a chance about when it was going to happen. So, we decided to play with different partners. He played with a good friend of his, his Davis Cup teammate and now captain, Arnaud Clement, for his last tournament as a professional player. After that, Mika dropped in the singles rankings, so he had to play different tournaments. He skipped the whole summer, when we were defending a lot of points—we won Washington and Montreal, reached the finals of Cincy.\n\nAM: It was something like two thousand points.\n\nNZ: Yeah. So, when he came to the US Open, I’d been playing with different partners (two tournaments with [Paul] Hanley, with Janko at Queens and the Olympics, and with [Alexander] Peya at Wimbledon). We still had a chance to make the [World Tour Finals]; but we knew the US Open was probably the last chance, since he’d made plans not to go to Asia—where we again had done well, winning Beijing and playing the finals in Shanghai. So, it was a lot of pressure and that’s where we decided to split. I had to find a different partner for the next year because I really didn’t know what to expect from him.\n\nThat’s when I decided to play with Robert. We started the year working extremely hard, trying to get to know each other, understand our games, and find the best game style for us to play. But in the end, it didn’t really work out. What I can say is that we tried extremely hard, both of us.\n\nAM: You won Rotterdam, right?\n\nNZ: Yeah, we won Rotterdam, and we played the finals in Stockholm and Dubai—those were good results, good moments. But we didn’t really get to understand each other, and I think it was a good decision that we stopped.\n\nAM: How has it been working with Julien Benneteau?\n\nNZ: Benneteau is again a singles player with whom I don’t get a lot of opportunities to practice, similar to the situation with Mika. But we get along really well, and we were lucky to start with a win—a huge win—in Monte Carlo. That gave us a chance to make the Masters, which is something he hasn’t achieved yet. So, that’s a good motivation for us—and for me, it’s a challenge to make it again with a different partner. A good thing about the Bryans winning everything is that the rest of the teams are going to fight until the end of the year to see who’s going to make it. Even if the Bryans don’t play another match for the rest of the year, they’re going to finish number one, which is a great achievement for them.\n\nJulien and I are hoping to work at our partnership. It’s difficult when you start without being seeded. We had some tough draws, then some injuries that Julien had at the French Open during his singles match. So, it’s a little frustrating when things like this happen, but it’s part of the sport and hopefully we can continue a good partnership from here.\n\nAM: As of today, you guys are #9 in the race, but fewer than 1000 points—essentially, spitting distance—separate the teams ranked 3-13. Other than winning, what do you need to do over the next few months to secure a spot in London? Are there specific adjustments you and Julien need to make as a pair?\n\nNZ: Not really. Sometimes you have to be a little lucky with the draw. Here, we have a pretty tough first round, with Nestor & Lindstedt, seeded third. The difference is that if we keep winning, starting in Washington and then Montreal, it’s going to improve our ranking so that we can get a top-eight seed at the US Open. That would give us a little better chance to get to the quarters. It doesn’t really matter who you play then—you’ve made some points, which is good for the race. Later on, when you play Masters series, being seeded or getting a “bye” makes a big difference; you get a better draw, for sure. This is where it’s a little difficult to start with a new partner, who isn’t ranked high enough. But, I believe in our game—we proved that we can beat anybody. Our first tournament, we played against the best teams and we won; so, I’m sure we can keep playing well. The main thing is to stay healthy, and the results will come.\n\nAM: Have you been in touch with Viktor since the ITF decision?\n\nNZ: Of course I’ve talked to Viktor—he’s my great friend, like everyone on the team. We’ve known each other a long time and know each other well; so, this news is extremely difficult for all of us. Naturally, I already knew about this, because I was there when it happened in Monte Carlo. I think it came down to a big misunderstanding—and Viktor will be the one to suffer, even if he’s not guilty. I’m one-hundred percent confident that he hasn’t taken any prohibited substances. Something very unusual happened: I think it’s partly his fault and partly the fault of the person who did the test. She should have told him, in fact, that he absolutely doesn’t have the right to refuse to take the test. If he were told in that way, I think he’d have done it at any cost and then everything would’ve been fine. We’ll see what happens in the end—he has the option to appeal and I trust that we’ll at least reduce what I think is an extremely strict and heavy penalty, particularly given that he’s never tested positive for anything. I hope it’ll end well.\n\nAM: Moving on to Davis Cup, how will Viktor’s absence affect the team, both psychologically and strategically?\n\nNZ: With anyone from the team absent, it makes our path harder. If we all participate, if we’re all healthy, we have a lot more options and possibilities as far as tactics, freshness, and so on. Certainly, it won’t be easy, given that we play right after the US Open and that Novak will surely come late. We’ve also got to adapt to the time difference and a different surface. Regardless, we’ve had to deal with this situation before when Novak wasn’t on the team or, this year, Janko hasn’t been with us twice. So, in the worst-case scenario, if Viktor can’t play, I trust we’ll still find a way to get the win.\n\nAM: Do you have any input on who will replace him, since this player might be partnering you in doubles, or does Captain Obradović make the decision on his own?\n\nNZ: The captain always consults with me about who I’d want to play with, even though it’s not ultimately my choice who ends up being my partner because we have to decide based on who needs to be freshest for singles the next day or for some other reason. But for the most part, we talk together—all the players. Because I’m the oldest and most experienced, there are some things that I can predict better, at least where doubles are concerned. So, we’ll see.\n\nIf Viktor’s not there, it decreases our options for doubles since Novak probably won’t come until Wednesday and he’s supposed to play on Friday; then, for him to play all three days would be too hard. Whether I’ll play with Janko or maybe a fourth player—Bozoljac or Lajović—we’ll have to see what the situation is. We have plenty of time, and those are decisions that get made a day or two in advance.\n\nAM: What kind of reception do you think the Canadian team will get in Belgrade?\n\nNZ: Well, Daniel and Miloš are Canadians and they’ll be representing their country. Daniel was born in Belgrade, but he definitely feels Canadian. Of course, the Serbian crowd will cheer for us. But I believe there will be both Canadians and, say, Montenegrins who will be a great support for Miloš, considering he was born in Podgorica and his family is there. So, that’s something we’re expecting. I think it’ll be interesting in that regard, since 75% of their team—Dančević, too—have roots in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nAM: How do you rate Serbia’s chances to get to another final?\n\nNZ: I think we have chances against any team in the world—especially if Novak is there, because he can always deliver two points, no matter the opponent or surface. He’s proven that and I trust it’ll be the case this time. I also hope Janko, who has at least three tournaments before Davis Cup, will play himself into form and lift his confidence, which will be extremely important, given that he and Novak will play singles. And that, too, will be a very important point. I think the Canadians have a very strong team with Nestor and Pospisil, who has shown that he can play both singles and doubles exceptionally well. Then again, we’re playing on clay—a surface on which their second player, whoever it is, really shouldn’t be able to threaten either Janko or Novak. So, it’ll be interesting to see what kind of form Miloš is in; with his serve, he’s a very troublesome player who can surprise anyone. But I think that kind of surprise is much harder to pull off on clay, over best-of-five sets—and that’s why I think we have an advantage irrespective of Viktor’s presence. Of course, circumstances could arise in which Nole arrives late, or a player is tired or injured, and we don’t have an adequate substitute; but they could have the same problems.\n\n***\n\nBenneteau and Zimonjić went on to win not only their first match in Washington but, in fact, the whole tournament, beating Mardy Fish and Radek Stepanek in the final. Afterwards, Nenad shared a few thoughts on the week as well as on the state of men’s doubles more generally.\n\nOn the Citi Open\n\nIt feels really great to win such a big tournament. It’s a 500 series, but not just that: it was a very strong field—you didn’t have any easy matches here. To return after a long break and to play this well and win the tournament without losing a set is really the best way to come back to the tour. It was a lot of fun, I have to say, for both of us to play—we had a great time here, on the court and off. So, hopefully this will help us for the upcoming three tournaments.\n\nOn the popularity of doubles\n\nI think in the States, doubles is quite popular—England, too. The biggest problem is, I think, scheduling. The biggest problem is maybe not putting the doubles at the good times, which is before the singles. I would compare it to a boxing match or some concerts, where you go and you want to see the best at the end. The best here is definitely singles, no question about that. But doubles is a lot of fun: it’s a good game, it’s something different that you don’t see in singles. I think this is a good combination—you can use both “products,” if you can call them that, and make them popular and people can enjoy them. Before, you had guys serving and volleying, playing that style; now, in singles, you don’t have that any more. Still, you have it in doubles, where you have these reactions and quick points that you’re not going to see in singles. Then again, the rallies, the running, some incredible points that you’re going to see in singles, you’re not going to see in doubles. So, I would never compare it, but I believe that you can make tennis really popular by promoting doubles as well.\n\nOn his and Federer’s racquet changes\n\nI changed it completely. I’ve played with the same racquet from, I would say, 2001 and this was the first week playing with this racquet. Usually, you don’t do this in the middle of the season, if you’re not 100% sure. But you’re never really right when you start playing—it’s one thing in practice. So, when you come to play, it’s always nice to have this confirmation with wins and shots that you make, that, “OK, this is it, this was a good decision.” Then, you move on. For me, it was a very nice transition. It’s the same brand (Head) racquet and I think it was good for me…. I don’t know about [Roger], but I’m guessing that maybe it’s a bigger sweet spot, which is the case with my racquet, and a little bit of extra power. This is what can make a big difference nowadays, with everybody serving big and hitting the big ground-strokes. You want to find the best equipment that you can, with the strings, with the racquet, with the shoes—this is what’s very, very important.\n\nOn playing other doubles specialists & predominantly singles players\n\nI want to play against the best players. For me, it doesn’t matter if you’re a singles or doubles player. There are singles players that are really good in doubles and there are some that are not as good. Also, the other way around…. So, you want to play against the best and to challenge yourself as an athlete. You want to play the best singles guys, the best doubles guys—you want to play them all. And nowadays, it’s interesting because it’s changing a little bit, the way the guys are playing. Some of them have decided to stay back, playing from the baseline and hitting big ground-strokes; some teams are playing traditional doubles, which is what we are doing, serve and volleying; some guys are playing I-formation. There are a lot of tactics going on; so, as a player, you have to be adjusting to all of this, practicing to get better to face all these opponents.\n\nOn doubles formats and scheduling\n\nRegarding no-AD scoring and match tiebreaks: I think it’s a good format. We don’t really know, because nobody made a survey after that change, if it’s the right decision to go super tiebreaker at the end or to play a regular set with no-AD—which would take maybe five or ten minutes longer, but which I think could be a little more fair. Then again, maybe some of the singles guys would then decide not to play…. This format where you play super tiebreaker is a little tricky because you could be the much better team for the first set and most of the second, then you end up losing the set [snap!]—and you’re in the super tiebreaker and everything happens so quick. So, sometimes this is not fair that teams like this lose—you don’t have a chance, really, to get back in the match since the super tiebreaker’s really quick. On the other hand, the points are very interesting: every point counts, every point is a big point, it’s a lot of fun for the crowd, and we are adjusting to it.\n\nBut the format that we’re talking about and the point about playing doubles before the singles, the best example is in the [World Tour Finals] at the end of the year in London, where all the matches are televised. The turnout is really amazing, it’s a lot of pleasure for the players and the fans. You have both a day session and a night session and you can watch a doubles match and a singles match with the best eight teams and best eight players in the world. I think this is the winning combination and this is what we should aim to do as much as possible. Sometimes, the same players will be in singles and doubles, and then you have to play doubles after; but every other time, I think you should play doubles before—maybe a little closer than what we did today [the men’s doubles and singles finals were scheduled at noon and three, respectively]. Because I think if we started at one o’clock, that would still give us time to finish the match and have the ceremony. In any case, this is much better than to play after, in my opinion.\n\nRegarding best-of-five set matches: As a player, if you play best-of-five, you have a lot of chances to get back in the match. If somebody wins against you, he’s definitely the better player that day. So, you have no excuses, really. But, in my mind, because tennis is very physical now, I think it’s really long to play best-of-five. I love to watch tennis—I love playing, I love watching, and for me it’s too long. I think this format that we’re testing in doubles, which is no-AD, could be very interesting in the future in singles if they were to try to change something. Then, you would not have these long games—same thing as what happened in volleyball, with the rule changes, same thing in table tennis. I think those are good changes. Maybe the only difference I would suggest in singles is that it could be the server’s choice, not the receiver’s, about where to serve…. Then, you will have quick games and the matches won’t go really long—advantage, deuce, advantage, deuce—and maybe playing best-of-five wouldn’t take such a long time. But you would make it a special thing at the Grand Slams to play best-of-five, with no-AD—why not? This is something that maybe we should try. At the end of the day, the best players will be at the top no matter what rules you play—everybody will adjust…. We’ll see where tennis will go, but some changes wouldn’t be bad at all.\n\n***\n\nAlthough they lost to Colin Fleming and Andy Murray in the first round of the Coupe Rogers in Montreal, the French-Serbian pair earned enough points in Washington to be seeded at the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati next week. They also moved into the sixth spot in the race to London."
