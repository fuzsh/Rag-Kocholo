        "text": "PARIS – The hottest team in men's doubles right now have had a rather interesting history – including a three-year hiatus when they were playing their best tennis, one that ended with their reunion to start the 2014 season.\n\nThrough the years, there have been numerous wardrobe and sponsor changes. But today, as Canadian Daniel Nestor and Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic reach the third round of the French Open and look to go further, the have come full circle – and are as matchy-matchy as they have ever been on court.\n\nIf they can bring that perfect coordination to their tennis, they might come home with another Grand Slam trophy next weekend.\n\nHere's an overview of their fashion history.\n\n(If you can't see this on your mobile device or iPad, click here)\n\nThe pair had some issues in their first two rounds. In the first round, against Aussie Matt Ebden and Russian Dmitry Tursunov who it should be noted, were perfectly matches in blue and neon green Fila, they were pushed to a third set before Ebden's leg injury pretty much sealed the issue.\n\nThursday, they dropped the second set against Roberto Bautista-Agut of Spain and Igor Sisjling of the Netherlands after Zimonjic's serve was broken twice. But they prevailed, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3 to move into the third round.\n\nThe next opponents for the No. 3 seeds will be No. 13 seeds Jean-Julien Rojer of the Netherlands and Horia Tecau of Romania.\n\nIn the world of the doubles specialists, most of the teams are intimately familiar with each other. But although Nestor has faced both players innumerable times to count, he has never faced them as a team, only with other partners.\n\nTecau and Rojer have played together all season. But any success they've had has come at smaller events, ones Nestor and Zimonjic don't play. In the bigger tournaments - the Masters 1000s – they've not lasted long enough for the two teams to meet."
