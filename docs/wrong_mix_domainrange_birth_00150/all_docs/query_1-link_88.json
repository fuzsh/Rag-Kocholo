        "text": "Novak Djokovic will be playing his first tournament since parting ways with Goran Ivanisevic last month. As Djokovic hasn’t announced who will replace Ivanisevic as the coach, the Serb’s recent activity with former doubles player Nenad Zimonjic sparked speculation that the 36-year-old would soon hire the Serbian coach.\n\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is underway, and Djokovic, who withdrew his name from the Miami Open citing work-life balance, was seen practicing on clay in Belgrade.\n\nZimonjic, who was also present during the Serb’s practice session and has known him for more than 20 years, gave him some valuable tips. In an exclusive interview with Eurosport, Djokovic opened up about his relationship with the Serbian coach.\n\nWe have known each other really well for more than 20 years. He’s always been like an older brother to me. A mentor, a friend, who always tried to help me as a person and as a player. Novak Djokovic told Eurosport\n\nDjokovic, who asked Zimonjic to be present during the practice sessions, admitted he doesn’t play his best when he approaches the nets, and so he found the advice of Zimonjic helpful.\n\nWhen I stopped with Goran, I was starting my clay-court preparation in Belgrade and he was there. He came to the court, and we really enjoyed our collaboration and I asked him to come there for a few weeks. Novak Djokovic added\n\nNovak Djokovic says Rafael Nadal must play at the French Open for the sake of tennis\n\nRafael Nadal won’t be seen playing at the Monte Carlo Masters due to the injury that has kept him out of the tennis courts for the majority of the 2023 season. This year, he played only at the Brisbane International and missed the Australian Open as well as the Indian Wells.\n\nNovak Djokovic, during the same interview with Eurosport, wished for Nadal’s comeback, especially at the Roland Garros for the sake of tennis. Djokovic also wishes to play against the Spanish legend at least one more time before he retires.\n\nFor the sake of all tennis and Roland-Garros in particular, we hope that he can play there. Novak Djokovic said\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion also reminisced the time he used to compete against Nadal. Djokovic concluded by saying how both would reflect upon the journey and the competition and cherish them once they retire.\n\nDjokovic will play his first match on April 9. Before the Monte-Carlo Masters, Luca Nardi knocked him out of the second round at Indian Wells."
