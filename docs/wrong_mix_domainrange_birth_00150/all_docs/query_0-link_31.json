Men’s professional tennis has had a remarkable ability over the years to consistently produce compelling storylines, and 2019 promises to be no different. The one-on-one gladiatorial nature of our sport has always been enthralling, and our athletes continue to amaze on some of the biggest stages in sport. We are fortunate to be witnessing an intriguing transitional period in the men’s game: on the one hand, we have global icons who are standing firm at the top of the game; and on the other, a talented wave of younger players who look set to pick up the mantle for years to come. While the top 3 in the year-end ATP Rankings had a familiar look in 2018, with Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer leading the way, many will have taken notice of the final match of the 2018 ATP Tour season, in which Alexander Zverev defeated Djokovic in the final of the Nitto ATP Finals, as a sign of what might follow. Will 2019 be the year that the next generation breaks through on the biggest stages in our sport? Only time will tell, but this season will undoubtedly make for fascinating viewing as Zverev is joined by the likes of Karen Khachanov, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alex de Minaur and many more, as ones to watch in 2019. The depth of talent on the Tour is phenomenal, and the 2019 season will provide a riveting backdrop as the next chapter unfolds in our great sport. All roads will once again lead to London, and to the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals at The O2 in November. The O2 continues to provide an exceptional stage for our showpiece event where we have welcomed more than 2.5 million fans since 2009. November will also see the return of the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan, where the world’s best 21-and-Under players of the year will compete on a global stage, as we continue to use the event as a platform to trial rule changes and innovation. May I take this opportunity to invite you to join us on what we expect to be a thrilling journey in 2019. This Media Guide offers a wealth of information on the tournaments and players who will showcase the game around the world, and we thank you for your coverage and support of men’s professional tennis. Best wishes,\n\nChris Kermode ATP Executive Chairman & President\n\n1\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS 01-09 INTRO ATP TOUR INTRODUCTION\n\n11-21\n\nATP TOUR ADMINISTRATION\n\nTOURNAMENT DIRECTORY\n\n01 Credits 04 ATP Tour Timeline\n\n05 ATP Executive Chairman & President Bio 07 ATP Organisational Structure 08 ATP Board & Staff\n\n12 2019 Season & ATP Tour Profile 15 2019 Tournaments\n\n23-167\n\n169-208\n\nPLAYER BIOS\n\nRECORDS & RESULTS\n\n23 Player Biographies 159 Player Birthdays 160 Former ATP No. 1 Players Multiple Grand Slam Champions 167 Open Era Title Leaders\n\nATP RANKINGS\n\n170 ATP Rankings History of ATP World No. 1 171 2018 Year-End ATP Rankings 172 ATP Rankings Year-End Top 10 History 173 ATP Doubles Rankings History of No. 1 174 2018 Year-End ATP Doubles Rankings 175 ATP Doubles Rankings Year-End Top 10 History 176 2019 ATP Rankings Points Table\n\nSTATISTICS 177 179 180 183\n\n2018 Year-End & Career Prize Money Leaders 2018 ATP Tour & Grand Slam Finals 2018 ATP Tour By the Numbers Facts & Figures\n\nATP FINALS & ATP MASTERS 1000\n\n2019\n\n185 186 188 190 191\n\n2018 Nitto ATP Finals Nitto ATP Finals History 2018 Next Gen ATP Finals ATP Masters 1000 Stats ATP Masters 1000 Finals\n\nGRAND SLAMS & OLYMPICS HISTORY\n\n194 Australian Open 196 Roland Garros 198 Wimbledon 200 US Open 203 All-Time Grand Slam Title Leaders & Olympics Medalists\n\nDAVIS CUP HISTORY\n\n205 Davis Cup Champions & Finals\n\nATP CHALLENGER TOUR 206 2018 ATP Challenger Tour Stats\n\nATP TOUR AWARDS 207 ATP Tour Awards\n\n3\n\nATP TOUR TIMELINE The ATP is in its fifth decade as a leading governing body in professional tennis. The organisation was formed in 1972 when a handful of the game’s top players met in a secluded stairwell at the US Open to discuss the need for a players’ association. Under the leadership of newly elected executive director Jack Kramer and president Cliff Drysdale, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) came to life with a goal of changing the game for the better. THE FOLLOWING IS A LOOK BACK AT KEY ATP EVENTS OVER THE PAST FIVE DECADES:\n\n1973: The ATP establishes the computer ranking system, providing a fair analysis of a player’s performance and creating an objective way to determine entries into tournaments. 1974: The Men’s International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC), made up of ATP, ILTF and tournament directors, is formed to govern the sport as an “independent, democratic, international body for the administration of professional tennis”. 1976: The ATP Doubles computer rankings begin on 1 March. 1980: The ATP sets up a player pension fund. 1985: At the request of the ATP, MIPTC passes a drug testing rule, making tennis the first professional sport to institute a workable and well-designed drug testing programme. 1986: In an effort to make the calendar more coherent, the MIPTC moves the Australian Open a month back to January (1987) and The Masters a month earlier to December (1986). 1988: The players, under ATP CEO Hamilton Jordan, hold a press conference in the US Open parking lot to announce that they will assume more control of the game. “Tennis at the Crossroads” outlines a plan for players to form a new tour. Tournament directors representing many of the world’s leading events voice their support for the players and join them in what was to become a partnership unique in professional sports – players and tournaments each with an equal voice in how the circuit is run.\n\n1990: Sponsored by IBM, the ATP Tour era begins with an equal partnership between players and tournaments. The circuit features 76 tournaments in 28 countries on six continents, with prize money averaging a 50% increase at the events. Indianapolis tournament director Mark Miles is named ATP CEO.\n\n2009: Adam Helfant takes over as ATP Executive Chairman and President in January. Three new tournament categories are introduced as the circuit is rebranded ATP World Tour: Masters 1000, 500 and 250 level events. The ATP’s season finale takes place at The O2 in London for the first time.\n\n1993: The ATP Tour extends its global reach, adding Arabian Gulf tournaments in Doha and Dubai.\n\n2012: Brad Drewett takes over as ATP Executive Chairman & President in January.\n\n1995: The ATP Tour launches its first web site, ATPTour.com.\n\n2013: Brad Drewett passes away in May from Motor Neurone Disease. In the preceding 12 months, he had led discussions resulting in significant prize money increases for all players across all Grand Slams.\n\n1996: The Mercedes-Benz/ATP partnership begins with a fouryear agreement. 1997: The ATP Senior Tour of Champions is sanctioned. 1998: Players form a new STARS program as the ATP Tour helps make players more accessible to media, sponsors and fans. ATP broadcasts extend their reach to more than 200 countries. 2000: The ATP Tour changes its name to ATP for 2001, introduces a new logo and rebrands its nine premier tournaments the Tennis Masters Series. 2005: Etienne de Villiers is named ATP Chairman in June. The year-end Tennis Masters Cup is held in Shanghai. 2007: The ATP introduces a number of changes to the Tour, including the elimination of bestof-5 set finals, as well as reduced draw sizes at five ATP Masters Series events to lessen the physical demands on top players and enhance TV scheduling. The ATP also increases prize money for the first time since 2000 and creates a new multi-million dollar marketing fund. 2008: All worldwide tennis organisations (WTA, ITF, ATP & Grand Slams) form a Tennis Integrity Unit.\n\n4\n\n2014: Chris Kermode takes over as ATP Executive Chairman and President on 1 January. The ATP’s season finale sets a new attendance record of 263,560 – the biggest in its 49-year history. 2015: The ATP secures an enhanced partnership with Emirates that sees the awardwinning airline become the Tour’s Premier Partner through 2020. 2017: The inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals take place in Milan, showcasing the world’s best 21-and-Under players in a new and innovative format. The Tour achieves an all-time attendance record with more than 4.5 million fans attending on-site. 2018: The ATP announces the launch of the ATP Cup, a new team event set to take place in Australia from January 2020 in partnership with Tennis Australia. A new ‘ATP Tour’ brand identity and ‘Love It All’ marketing campaign is unveiled for 2019.\n\nATP EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND PRESIDENT\n\nChris Kermode presents Novak Djokovic with the year-end ATP World No.1 trophy.\n\nCHRIS KERMODE began serving as ATP Executive Chairman & President on 1 January 2014. Kermode has been involved in tennis for more than 30 years, first as a player, and then as Tournament Director of The Queen's Club Championships, as well as Managing Director of the ATP’s season finale at The O2 from 2009-2013. Following his playing career, Kermode worked as one of London’s top tennis coaches. He went on to work in both the film and music industries, starting his own promotion & events company, before returning to tennis. Kermode and his wife, Adelle, have three children, Tess, Ellie and Sam. He is based in the ATP’s office in Monte Carlo.\n\n5\n\nATP ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Executive Chairman & President • Chris Kermode\n\nPlayer Representatives\n\nTournament Representatives\n\n• David Egdes (interim)\n\n• Gavin Forbes\n\n• Justin Gimelstob\n\n• Charles Smith\n\n• Alex Inglot\n\n• Herwig Straka\n\nPLAYER COUNCIL\n\nTOURNAMENT COUNCIL\n\n1-50 Singles\n\n5 Europe\n\nKevin Anderson (VP) Robin Haase John Isner Sam Querrey\n\nGiorgio Di Palermo, Stephen Farrow, Christer Hult, Richard Krajicek, Herwig Straka\n\n51-100 Singles Yen-Hsun Lu\n\n4 International Group\n\nAllon Khakshouri, Cameron Pearson, Charles Smith, Salah Tahlak\n\nVasek Pospisil\n\n1-100 Doubles Jamie Murray\n\nBruno Soares\n\nAt-Large\n\nNovak Djokovic (P) Stefano Travaglia\n\nAlumni\n\nColin Dowdeswell\n\nCoach\n\nDaniel Vallverdu\n\n4 Americas Gavin Forbes, Bill Oakes, Keely O’Brien, Andre Silva\n\nPLAYER MEMBERS l Division I\n\nl Division II\n\nTOURNAMENT MEMBERS l Full Members\n\nALUMNI MEMBERS COACH MEMBERS\n\nl Conditional Members\n\nSTAFF l London\n\nl Monte Carlo\n\nl Ponte Vedra Beach\n\nl Sydney\n\nCarries out the day-to-day operations and administration of the ATP\n\n7\n\nATP BOARD & STAFF BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nDavid Egdes\n\nPlayer Representative (Interim) International\n\nJustin Gimelstob\n\nGavin Forbes\n\nAlex Inglot\n\nPlayer Representative Americas\n\nCharles Smith\n\nTournament Representative Americas\n\nPlayer Representative Europe\n\nHerwig Straka\n\nTournament Representative International\n\nTournament Representative Europe\n\nMANAGEMENT COMMITTEE David Massey EVP Europe\n\nFlip Galloway Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer\n\nNicola Arzani SVP PR Gayle Bradshaw EVP Rules & Competition\n\nJeff Reel SVP & General Counsel\n\nSimon Higson VP Corporate Communications\n\nGeorge Ciz SVP Marketing & Business Development\n\nEric Starelli SVP Sales & Sponsorships\n\nRoss Hutchins Chief Player Officer\n\nMurray Swartzberg SVP Information Technology & Digital Media\n\nLinda Clark VP Tournament Relations Americas\n\nChris Kermode Executive Chairman & President\n\nTodd Ellenbecker VP Medical Services\n\nAlison Lee EVP International Group\n\nMark Young Vice Chairman, Chief Legal & Media Officer\n\nPR\n\nNicola Arzani\n\nSimon Higson\n\n[email protected]\n\nFabienne Benoit Europe\n\nMartin Dagahs\n\nInternational\n\n[email protected]\n\nNanette Duxin\n\nEurope\n\n[email protected] [email protected]\n\nBrendan Gilson\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nMark Epps\n\nInternational [email protected]\n\nEdward La Cava Americas\n\nStephanie Natal Europe\n\n[email protected] [email protected] [email protected] 8\n\nRichard Evans\n\nEurope\n\n[email protected]\n\nInternational\n\nMaria Garcia-Planas Americas\n\n[email protected] [email protected]\n\nJoshua Rey\n\nGreg Sharko\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]\n\nAmericas\n\nAmericas\n\nATP STAFF SUPERVISORS\n\nTom Barnes Dir.
