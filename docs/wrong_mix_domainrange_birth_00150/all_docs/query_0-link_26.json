Doctors made a successful bid for £320,000 from the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund. It will see surgeries open for longer through¬ out the district to cut the amount of time pa¬ tients have to wait to see a doctor. Ten surgeries across Cannock, Hednesford, Chadsmoor, Heath Hayes and Rawnsley will be involved in the initial one-year pilot project. The bid was made in response to complaints from patient groups and forums who said they wanted appointments when they were most needed - including late afternoons, evenings and weekends. If successful the initiative could be rolled out to other areas. But Councillor Muriel Davis, health leader for Cannock Chase Council, sounded a word of warning. “This is a useful project, and will help take the pressure off hospitals at these times,” she said. “My only concern is that it is not being well advertised. Some surgeries already open on a Saturday morning but have dropped the idea because the take-up was so low it wasn’t worth the doctors’ while coming in. Share “I haven’t seen anything promoting these extra appointments, and I feel strongly that the Clinical Commissioning Groups need to get out there and let people know.” As well as providing extra appointments, the project will look to strengthen ties and encour¬ age collaboration between GP practices in Can¬ nock and other organisations - including local hospitals and community services - by agreeing to share information and technology. Council¬ lor Davis said that under the pilot scheme, GPs were going to be able to access patient records no matter what practice they belonged to. Dr Mo Huda, chairman of Cannock Chase CCG, welcomed the move. He said: “Joining up healthcare services is the key to making sure local people get high-quality, consistent care. We’re thrilled this grant has been secured.” Clive Cropper, practice manager at Moss Street Surgery and a leading member of the Cannock Practices Network, which made the bid, said: “This is a massive boost for the people of Cannock Chase. “We have funding to run this project for 12 months and will be working hard to make it a success so it can be extended further.” The Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund was launched in October 2013 and initially made £50 million available to help improve access to general practice, with the first wave of 20 pilots announced in April 2014. A further £100million was made available for a second wave of appli¬ cations in September 2014. CARNIVAL CAPERS AS VILLAGE CELEBRATES All dressed up and ready for the Brereton Carnival on Saturday are, from left, Sue Merriman , Laura Dunning , Darren Foley and Ruth Templeton HUNDREDS of people are expected to de¬ scend on a park in Brereton for its carnival this weekend.

Fourteen schools took part, submit¬ ting 369 pieces of work, in the competi¬ tion organised by the intergenerational service at Age UK South Staffordshire. Entries were invited from Key Stage 1 and 2 pupils in all the schools who host a Children Matter volunteer. “The quality of the writing and the imagination has amazed us,” said Lisa Hibbert, Children Matter project organ¬ iser. “We asked the children to write about either Granny Beryl’s Soup or ‘When I am older’ but the type of writ¬ ing was left up to them.” The judges set themselves the ‘impos¬ sible’ task of compiling a shortlist of 10 in each category but finally settled on 12 in KS1 and 14 in KS2. The KS1 winner was Ellie Brown aged six, of Princefield First School, Penk- ridge. Runners-up were Amelia Long, seven, of St James Primary School, Longdon, and Erin Bates, six, of St Mi¬ chael’s First School, Penkridge. The KS2 winner was Jacob Green, nine, of Princefield First School, Penk¬ ridge. Runners-up were Talisa Dobb, 10, of John Wheeldon Primary Academy, Stafford, and Faith Youd, 11, of Jerome Primary, Norton Canes. Staff based at The Roller Mill in Pen¬ kridge voted for their favourite, the winner being Harrison Horan at St Leonard’s First School, Dunston. Author and judge Anne Fine was impressed by all the entries she read. “Something must be working well in Staffordshire schools. “These entries are a good deal better, for the age groups concerned, than any I have judged for quite a while. Everyone should be really pleased.” Nuisance boozers are targeted in crackdown NUISANCE drinkers are being targeted in a new hard-hitting police crackdown in Cannock town centre. There are 12 drinkers who regular¬ ly gather in the Church Street area, including in the grounds of St Luke’s Church. Now, nine of them have been sent warn¬ ing letters, community protection notices, saying they could be sent to prison for up to five years if they persist. One, a 39-year-old man, has already breached the warning and is facing a court summons for his street drinking. Police and council officers launched the crackdown following complaints from shop¬ pers and businesses. The town centre al¬ ready operates an alcohol restriction zone. New Cannock police commander, Chief Inspector Geoffrey Knight is leading the scheme, which has been introduced under the new Anti-social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014. Ch Insp Knight said: “I have identified an issue of anti-social behaviour in and around the town centre, with persons who have been consuming alcohol and misbe¬ having. Court “This is an ongoing issue that we are going to tackle using new policing powers. It is a problem that was brought to our at¬ tention by local people and by the district council and we are doing something about it. My aim is to eradicate this problem with the help of the new legislation. I intend to use it to its full effect. “We have issued up to nine community protection notices so far. “The notice tells them what they must and mustn’t do. If they fail to comply they commit an offence and can be sent a court summons for a criminal behaviour order. “If they then breach the order they face up to five years in prison. “We are talking about a dozen people who despite the fact that there are signs warning against street drinking are contin¬ uing. We would urge members of the public to tell us if they have any issues to report so that we can build up a case.” Cannock South ward representative, Councillor Maureen Freeman has wel¬ comed the action. Every little helps for Scout group Scout group committee member Coxill with fellow store managers SCOUTS and Cubs now have the freedom to roam around their base thanks to work carried out by a team of supermarket managers. Vegetation has been cleared to create a pathway around the 1st Heath Hayes Beavers and Scouts hut at The Willows. A group of 22 Tesco store man¬ agers from across Staffordshire cut the grass and cleared the weeds, their aim being to make the sur¬ rounding site of the hut safe for the youngsters. Heath Hayes Tesco store manager Andy Coxill said: “The club’s leader Rachel came into the store a couple of months ago, and we got talking about the Samantha Roberts and Tesco Heath Hayes store manager Andy clear the grounds of the 1st Heath Hayes Beavers and Scouts hut club, and if there was anything we could do as their local store to help. “She told us the clubhouse was in desperate need of some atten¬ tion but she didn’t have the time nor bodies to do anything about it. “I offered our support and man¬ aged to gather another 21 store managers across the area to have a fun-filled hard-working day.” The 1st Heath Hayes Beavers and Scouts took over ownership of the hut in September, starting their own work on the premises in February. Rachel Frondigoun, who became Scout leader in Janu¬ ary, said: “We took over ownership of the scout hut late last year, it hadn’t been well loved for a while and needed a lot of work doing.” “We installed a kitchen and re¬ furbished the toilets and they have built on the foundation and made great strides. We now have safe fire escape and they painted one of the rooms, which we plan to use as a meeting room or breakout room to use for small groups.” “Now we can use all of the hut - that room was derelict before,” Ms Frondigoun added. “With the work they have done outside too, we have made progress to be able to use all of the grounds we have got. We’re very grateful, it has made a huge difference.” MR elected to business and skills committee CANNOCK Chase MP Amanda Milling has been voted onto the Business Inno¬ vation and Skills Committee. The Conservative MP said: “I am re¬ ally thrilled to have been elected. “I was particularly keen to sit on this committee given my business back¬ ground and the importance of the busi¬ ness sector to our local economy. “Sitting on the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee is an oppor¬ tunity for me to have an even stronger role in Parliament, share my expertise and put it to good use helping to shape policy and decisions in this area.” The committee is responsible for scru¬ tinising the administration, expenditure and policy of the Department for Busi¬ ness, Innovation and Skills and its asso¬ ciated public bodies. Meanwhile, Ms Milling is urging pu¬ pils in Cannock Chase to enter a na¬ tional enterprise competition - Tycoon in Schools 2015 - run by Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones. Teams submit a detailed business plan and receive a loan of up to £1,000 from the charity. They are then challenged to raise as much profit as possible during a set trading period. Ms Milling said: “I want young people in Cannock Chase to take advantage of this unique practical experience, to see what starting and running a business, and hopefully making a profit is like. “Business experience is a great way to stand out on a CV when entering the workplace or applying to further educa¬ tion.” Make some noise plea to musicians BUDDING young musicians can put their skills to the test at open auditions this weekend.

Mark, aged 31, left his home in Pen- kridge at 4.30am on Tuesday, heading to Wolverhampton to mark the start of his 2,340-mile challenge. He is aiming to beat the current re¬ cord of 52 marathons in consecutive days. The window cleaner will be fitting in his day job, going out on his rounds throughout the 90-day challenge, and hopes to raise £90,000. He will continue running when he goes on holiday to Cornwall at the end of the month. The money raised will be split be¬ tween the Tommy’s pregnancy char¬ ity, and Katharine House Hospice in Stafford. Mark’s wife Tammy has suffered seven miscarriages, and he said Tom¬ my’s had been a huge support. Mark said he was looking forward to finally starting the challenge, al¬ though he said the training had been tough. “I have been out running early every morning, although I have now got so much equipment it feels like I am going on holiday,” he said. “The important thing is to have a good recovery rate.” Originally from Shropshire, Mark will return to his hometown of Shrewsbury for his 88th run on No¬ vember 2.

Shop helps raise child charity cash THE Spar shop in Great Wyrley has helped raise almost half a million pounds for the NSPCC in 2014-15. A total of £493,325 was raised by Spar UK, which has raised £4.5m since the partnership began in 2006. Baby joy for battling Margot's parents The new arrival, Digby Martini THE parents of inspirational Margot Martini - whose fight for life touched hearts around the world - have had a baby boy. Yaser and Vicki, who was brought up in Essington and went to school in Cheslyn Hay, announced the happy news on the Team Margot Facebook on Saturday, stating: “Margot would have loved her little brother, Digby who was born yesterday morning by c-sectionat 11:32, weighing 81bs lOoz. “We are delighted to welcome Digby into our family.” Margot, aged two, caught the pub¬ lic’s imagination in a worldwide ap¬ peal for a bone marrow donor to help her overcome two rare forms of leu¬ kaemia. She died last October. Yaser said they found out Vicki was about three weeks pregnant just two days after Margot passed away. The proud father said: “We are re¬ ally thrilled that Digby has arrived. “It’s good for the family, but in some ways it is tinged with a little bit of sadness as we are reminded of Mar¬ got. We feel very blessed we have got a healthy little boy.” He is the couple’s third son, and Yaser said eight-year-old Oscar and Rufus, aged six, were very excited about their little brother. Digby was born in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. A room at a London hostel has been decorated and dedicated in memory of Margot. Keystone House Hostel in Kings Cross has opened the Mar¬ got Room and profits generated from guests will be donated to the Team Margot Foundation. Yaser said: “We’re totally blown away by the kindness and generosity from the team at Keystone.” Pair must pay £8k over dogs kept in squalor A BROTHER and sister who kept 29 dogs in filthy and cramped condi¬ tions at their Burntwood home have been ordered to pay £8,000. Rosemary and Paul Wiggin had denied failing to ensure the welfare of the dogs but were found guilty after a trial. They were both given conditional discharges as the district judge said any harsher sentences were not possible as she was a full-time carer for her mother and he worked shifts. RSPCA inspectors seized the dogs, one found whimpering in a cupboard, during a five-hour visit to the house in Burntwood on January 31 last year. They said the property was too dirty and too cramped for so many ani¬ mals - 21 adult dogs and eight puppies. Officials found faeces ground into carpets, fly eggs in food that had been left out and some dogs soaking wet and without shelter in the garden. Rosemary Wiggin was given a three-year condi¬ tional discharge and or¬ dered to pay £1,000 costs. Her brother must pay £7,000 costs and was given a one-year con¬ ditional discharge. Both were banned from keeping dogs for 12 months. District Judge Shamim Qureshi, said he had never given a disqualification for less than 10 years before but in this case the dogs were ‘con¬ sidered part of the family’. The court heard there were now 44 dogs in boarding kennels after some had litters, and the total boarding costs since they were taken had reached £75,000. But the judge said a fine for the pair was ‘out of the question’ as Rosemary Wiggin was unemployed and her brother did not earn enough. Rosemary Wiggin had insisted the an¬ imals were fed roast chicken and bought gar¬ den loungers to sunbathe on. The 49-year-old along with her brother Paul Wiggin, 53, both of Queen Street, were found guilty of failing to ensure the welfare of the dogs, after a trial at Burton Magistrates Court. Nursery’s bouncy castle is stolen Harvey Lynas, Harriet Parton, Aimme Fox and Cass Hurford with nursery manager Emma Corbett THIEVES took a bouncy castle from a Norton Canes nursery, days before its summer fete. Honeybuns Nursery in Walsall Road had its outdoor play area broken into, with the thieves grabbing its custom-made bouncy castle. It meant children went without the inflatable during their summer fair. The nursery’s director of care Alison Shipton said: “It is quite spiteful to come and steal it, it put a real dampener on the the fun day and left the children devas¬ tated. “The castle was made for the nursery in our logo colours and it has ‘Honeybuns Nursery’ printed on. It is extremely heavy and would have taken more than one person to carry or lift.” A post by the nursery group on Facebook, asking families to share details of the theft, has been shared by more than 600 people and seen by more than 51,000. The post was seen by Hednes- ford-based Roxie’s Bouncy Cas¬ tles, which offered a replacement. “Roxie’s Bouncy Castles really saved the day by donating us a castle for free, it wouldn’t have been the same without it,” Alison added. “We have had a really good response.” Staffordshire Police have been informed of the theft. Anyone with information should call 101. NEWS IN BRIEF Salisbury's £l0k for response team SAINSBURY’S in Cannock has raised £10,300 for Burntwood & District Community First Responders as part of the Local Charity of the Year scheme. The charity is a group of volunteers who attend accident emergencies. After being chosen by customers and Sainsbury’s staff last June, it has received support from the store for the past year. Activities have included tombolas, raffles and used book sales. Store manager Paul Davis said: “We’ve had an excellent year supporting CFR.” Lions share in planning walk RUGELEY Lions were one of the first clubs to respond when veteran long distance walker, Keith Ogley, from the Kettering and District branch asked for support with his Lands End to John O’Groats walk for charity. So when 72-year-old Keith arrived in the Cannock Chase district he was greeted by Lion Ed Rule who had planned the next two days’ walk to Abbots Bromley and Ashbourne. Keith continued on his journey along the Staffordshire Way and Limestone Way receiving sponsorship and encouragement from other Lions. Hygiene award for labels firm A COMPANY with a branch in Burnt¬ wood has been officially recognised for its hygiene standards. Mercian Labels has achieved an ‘A’ grade BRC (British Retail Con¬ sortium) Accreditation. Last year, the firm made a six-figure investment in a new press at its other site, in Derby, and this year has made a similar sized investment in Burntwood. Mercian produces millions of high-quality self-adhesive labels every month for more than 9,000 customers. Careers advice for students from firms MORE than 20 top companies were in attendance at Cannock Chase High School’s annual careers fair.

A READER may have solved the two biggest problems facing Europe, Afri¬ can refugees and Greek debt. He writes: “Why not combine the two? Write off the interest repayments and in return Greece finds a home for all the migrants and ref¬ ugees that no other member states can accommodate. The population growth and house-building boom will stimulate their economy and they will grow their way back to economic fitness.” MEANWHILE, is anyone considering a scheme for British families to sponsor Greek families? There is tremendous sym¬ pathy towards ordinary Greek people. A hundred quid a month may not be a lot to some UK families but it would be manna from heaven for a cash-strapped family in Athens or Corfu. After the First World War, British towns and cities adopted war- wrecked towns in France and Flanders to help in their recovery. Politicians and bankers clearly haven’t a clue how to get Greece back on its feet. Maybe it’s time for the ordinary people of Europe to have ago. TV subtitles which are produced in¬ stantaneously for news bulletins are a rich source of merriment. But when the sub-titl- ers have all the time in the world, there’s no excuse for getting it wrong. I am cur¬ rently ploughing through the box set of the fine Gillian Anderson thriller The Fall (BBC), set in Belfast. The subtitles refer to those well- known villains, the “distant Republicans.” Dissident, as it turns out. FROM the instructions for my new battery charger: “The charger have different pilot lamp of different quantity. The mo bright¬ ness of pilot lamp lighting the less elec¬ tric quantity is, and meed to be charged, during charging.” Which translates roughly as stand well back and switch it on with a long stick. WOMEN in Japan are reportedly flocking to a zoo to see Shabani, an 18-year-old sil- verback gorilla who has been likened to a male model with “brooding good looks.” I have a blind friend who has just received a new guide dog, a flat-coat retriever which is a similar hit with the ladies. One female admirer sighed: “If that dog was human, he’d be Poldark.” LOOKS like the hot spell caught the supermarkets by surprise. Waitrose crum¬ pets, the perfect winter-night treat, were knocked down to 19p for eight. Nice, hot crumpets dripping with melted butter, any¬ one? Thought not. Don't miss Peter Rhodes every Mon¬ day to Friday in your Express & Star Mascot spreads word about club HEDNESFORD Town’s mascot Pit¬ man Pete flung himself into commu¬ nity events once again - partaking in three different appointments in one weekend. The first saw him invited to Ru- geley Leisure Centre to help present medals and trophies to the winning school teams from around the Can¬ nock Chase district. More than 200 pupils attended. Then the mascot attended two different events in the space of a few hours. First, he attended an open day at Longford Primary School, Cannock, before making his way to the sum¬ mer fete at St Peter’s Primary School in Hednesford. Pete was inundated with young¬ sters wanting their photograph taken with him at both events as he helped to spread the word about the Pitmen. Hednesford Town FC Sup¬ porters Association chairman Scott Smith said: “It is great to see Pitman Pete getting out and about in the local area, fitting in three events over the course of one weekend. “It’s nice to see how many young¬ sters actually recognise him and hopefully they and their parents will be at our friendly matches which start soon.” Meanwhile, Hednesford Town sup¬ porters have been busy at Keys Park, helping out with painting, cleaning and general maintenance over the summer break. Dozens of Pitmen fans have been making weekly Wednesday night trips to the home of Rob Smith’s out¬ fit after the club made a call for some much-needed assistance to spruce up the surroundings. The band played on - for final time at Tack m. ' ?

Around 200 people turned up at the Bracken Close venue for the final send-off last weekend. Owner Geoff Summerfield is retir¬ ing after recently suffering a heart attack. The 64-year-old has been trying to sell the club for the last two years but so far no buyers have come for¬ ward. He said: “We have had some great times here and some great artists. Way back we had Nazareth play here and we have had all the best tributes from around the country. “We have bands come from Amer¬ ica to play. People want to hear the best. “From the start I wouldn’t have idiots in. “I know a lot of places do let them in because they spend a lot of money. Popular “But I would say for every one idiot you kick out you get three nice people in. “It is a shame someone has not come in to take it over.” Over the years, the venue has at¬ tracted big names including singing star Alvin Stardust and a host of popular tribute bands. For the final send off Sight and Sound headlined with a perfor¬ mance too from R.O.A.R - Rock Of Ages Reborn. Before Mr Summerfield owned the venue, it was a working men’s club dating back to the 1950s. Although it is his ill health behind the closure, Mr Summerfield admits numbers have dropped in recent years. He added: “This game has had it now, all the pubs are closing. Soon the only thing that will be left are Wetherspoons. The trouble is I have noticed people’s mindsets have changed. They are now much more health conscious. “If you go to any football matches now, whereas they used to be stand¬ ing outside the pub ahead of kick-off, they are now outside Costa Coffee. “We are not getting the numbers now that we used to have. Anyone who says they are is lying. “Numbers have dropped. It is get¬ ting harder and harder.” Regular visitors to the Tackeroo spoke of their sadness at the closure. Clive Hawkins, aged 61, who had travelled from Burton upon Trent for the final gig, said: “I remember when there used to be a Chinese next door. “It used to be called the Wok & Roll. It adjoined this place and you could just walk through. “The food there was spot on. I used to go in, have a meal, and then come and watch the band after. They are great memories. “I am very sad to see it go. I can¬ not believe it really.” And 57-year-old Janette Mahon, from Heath Hayes, said: “I have been coming here for years. Some¬ times I would come early and the bands would be tuning up. “I used to stop in a caravan park up the road. There is always a bril¬ liant atmosphere here, it is great. “It is a real shame it is going. Geoff is a lovely man and I have lots of good memories here.” Property prices 10 times more than wages HOUSE prices in more than a third of local authority areas in the West Mid¬ lands region are 10 times the average wages for first-time buyers, research has shown. In Cannock Chase, the lowest av¬ erage house price was £102,500 and the lowest average annual income £11,450. The number of new homes needed each year is said to be 271. Last year 150 homes were built. In the Lichfield district, the figures were £130,000 for the lowest price, £13,512 for the lowest income, 476 homes needed and 190 built. Stratford-on-Avon is the most diffi¬ cult place in the West Midlands to get a first step on the property ladder, the research from the National Housing Federation (NHF) revealed. Wychavon in Worcestershire, War¬ wick and Solihull closely follow as the top areas in the West Midlands where average wages, house prices and lim¬ ited ability to save for a deposit collide to price out would-be homeowners. The NHF highlights that decades of successive governments failing to build enough homes has led demand for homes to far exceed supply, driv¬ ing up house prices and causing home ownership to fall to a 29-year low. The National Housing Federation highlights that the current generation of aspiring first time buyers are con¬ siderably worse off than their parents were when it comes to their chances of being able to buy a home, due to successive governments failing to build enough homes to keep up with demand. Top award for Co-op society THE Midcounties Co-operative was crowned winner of the Co-operative of the Year Award at this year’s Co-oper¬ ative Congress held in Birmingham. The award, run by Co-operatives UK, recognises co-operative business excellence and rewards innovation in the industry. Midcounties was one of nine co-operative organisations to make the shortlist from the 65 nomi¬ nations received. Last year the society supported more than 10,000 community groups, including five Staffordshire organisa¬ tions such as Border Collie Trust GB, which received £2,000 to be spent to¬ wards the purchase of a van. Cannock Cricket Club also ben¬ efited from a £600 donation, which funded new kit and equipment as well as coaching courses for two members.

John Kamelski, aged 65, suffered serious injuries when the black Mercedes he was driving was in col¬ lision with a HGV at around 8.10am last Thursday. The collision happened on the southbound carriageway in I lane one next to the Hilton Ser¬ vices entry slip road between junctions 11 and 10 a. Mr Kamelski J was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birming¬ ham by air ambu¬ lance but died at around 4.55pm last Friday. A family statement said: “Although our remarkable father could not be saved, we express our deepest grati¬ tude to all those at the scene. “There are no words to describe just how comforted and humbled we were to learn of the compassion of those commuters who rushed to his aid. “To all attending emergency ser¬ vices - your efforts to save such a wonderful man will never be forgot¬ ten. You gave his family a chance to say goodbye. A debt that can never be repaid.” Police are still appealing for wit¬ nesses. Call 101, quoting incident number 110 of July 2. John Kamelski Brilliant pupils graduate in style A GROUP of students at a Cannock school are celebrating after graduat¬ ing from a club that helps youngsters who want to attend top universities. Twenty four pupils at Cannock Chase High passed through The Bril¬ liant Club, which prepares students for the rigours of study at Russell Group universities. The Year 10 pu¬ pils were taught by PhD students dur¬ ing an eight-week programme. They then completed a 2,000 word assignment. At a graduation cere¬ mony at Warwick University each stu¬ dent was presented with a certificate. One assignment, written by Anneka Collins-Frisby, was considered to be of such high calibre that it is set to ap¬ pear in a forthcoming edition of fabled boffins’ journal The Scholar.

Rise is number of dangerous dogs seized THE number of dangerous dogs seized by police is on the increase as hundreds of attacks are reported every year, new figures show. West Midlands Police seized more than 400 dogs in 2013-14. Ands the figures show that more than 1,000 at¬ tacks were reported in the region between 2012 and 2014. More than 200 dogs were seized by West Mercia Police in three years, resulting in more than 100 being destroyed. Meanwhile, in Staffordshire, 18 dangerous dogs were destroyed between 2013 and 2015 after dozens were seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Figures uncovered by a Freedom of Information request found that 428 dogs were seized in the West Midlands force area in 2013-14 and 190 were de¬ stroyed. The numbers were up on the previous year when 353 were seized and 184 were destroyed, and in 2011-12 when 287 dogs were seized with 122 de¬ stroyed. Destroyed It came after 332 dog attacks were reported in 2014, 329 in 2013 and 367 in 2012. In Staffordshire, reports of dog attacks had risen to 301 in 2014 from 180 in 2013 and 162 in 2012. A total of 24 dogs had been seized across the force area in 2014-15, compared with 23 the year before and 15 in 2012-13. Nine of those animals were de¬ stroyed in 2014-15, with the same number in 2013- 14. In the West Mercia’s force area, 38 dogs were seized in 2012, 35 in 2013 and 145 in 2014, although the force claimed a change in recording from 2014 led to an increase in the numbers recorded. Figures show that of these, 70 were destroyed in 2014 and 18 were destroyed in both 2012 and 2013. Police were unable to provide specific figures for how many dog attacks were reported over the three- year period. The Dangerous Dogs Act was passed in 1991 and banned pit bull terriers and three other much rarer breeds, while it was later amended. Extra time to have a say on Tesco bid at pub site A COUNCIL is giving residents three extra time to express their views on plans to demolish a Cannock pub to make way for a supermarket. Staff and regulars at The Ascot Tavern, in Longford Road, have been battling to save their local after developers revealed the proposals. Amanda Milling, Conservative MP for Can¬ nock Chase, had given her support and sent a letter to the council objecting to the scheme. Cannock Chase Council has now replied to Ms Milling, who raised a number of objections to the plans including the loss of a valuable community asset, road safety concerns and the potential impact on neighbourhood shops and businesses. She also requested on behalf of res¬ idents that the deadline for making representa¬ tions about the application be extended, to give residents a greater opportunity to respond to the plans unveiled by Punch Taverns. The firm wants to replace it with a Tesco Ex¬ press store and a small commercial unit. The council agreed to give residents a fur¬ ther three weeks to comment on the applica¬ tion, with the deadline now July 17. Worried Ms Milling said: “I am very pleased that the council has listened to my request for an addi¬ tional opportunity for people to have their say. “The strength of feeling on this issue was clear to me from the volume of correspondence I received, and I was particularly worried that some people told me they felt they had not had an adequate opportunity to make their views known. I would encourage anyone who feels strongly about this application to express their views to Cannock Chase Council’s planning department or to me if they prefer. I would be happy to ensure any comments are passed on.” Punch Taverns’ proposal is to create a sin¬ gle-storey unit split into two parts, built in the same position on the site. The entrance and exit would remain the same but the car park would be reduced from 45 spaces to 22. The pub and other businesses in the area, including Nisa, in Bideford Way, have set up a petition. Pub customers, and owners of the shops in Bideford Way, have been discussing the potential of obtaining a community grant to support them in their bid. Ms Milling will be visiting a number of streets near The Ascot Tavern tomorrow for one of her regular street surgeries. Fight night fundraiser kicks off DOZENS of kickboxers have signed up for a fundraiser in the name of a Hednesford man who died in a fire¬ works warehouse blaze. A tournament has been organised to raise money for the son of Simon Hillier, aged 41, of Littleworth Road, whose life was claimed in a huge fire at SP Plastics in Stafford last year. More than 30 kickboxers have agreed to take part in the event at Featherstone Community Centre, Baneberry Drive, on Sunday. It starts at 7pm. The aim is to support the Thomas Hillier Trust Fund, which has been set up to help the five year-old over the coming years. Two kickboxers will be challenging for the memorial belt for Simon and so far 36 in total are taking part, with more are en¬ couraged to sign up. It includes peo¬ ple from Trojan club in Aldridge and also Huntington Kickboxing Club. Chief instructor Paul Whitehouse, from Featherstone Kickboxing Club, where Mr Hillier helped teach youngsters, is putting on the event. He said: “In the kickboxing world Simon was well-liked. As soon as I mentioned it to all the clubs every¬ one was keen.” Tickets are £25. Call 07778 508532. Blaze victim Simon Hillier NEWS IN BRIEF 5 Police warning over break-ins BURGLARS have targeted several homes in Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay for cash, jewellery and laptops, prompting police to warn residents. Sgt Carolyn Higgins urged house¬ holders to be on their guard against opportunist burglars who are on the lookout during the summer months for open windows and unlocked doors. She said: “We are asking residents to be extra vigilant and report any sus¬ picious activity immediately. “We’re carrying out patrols of the neighbourhoods being targeted and have been delivering advice leaflets.” 50 players enjoy club competition MORE than 50 players took part in a competition held at Cheslyn Hay Ten¬ nis Club. The Lawn Tennis Association ac¬ knowledged that the number of par¬ ticipants was one of the highest in the Midlands for a one-day event. Head coach Chris Perrin said: “We are particularly encouraged with the progress and success of competitions at the club.” For more information about tak¬ ing part in tennis at the club, contact Chris on 07969 829318 or visit www. cheslynha 3 dennis.weebly.c 0 m Cycle network has a new link THE latest work in a £4 million pack¬ age of improvements for cyclists in Staffordshire has been announced. The county council’s highways team will be linking up the National Cycle Network route from Alrewas towards the National Memorial Arboretum along the A513 in Lichfield. The six-week project will take place this summer. Cycling and walking in¬ itiatives have been boosted by a £1.4m county-wide investment by the coun¬ cil for public health projects.

ON Wednesday, as the nation becomes engulfed in Ashes fever, and while tennis fans watch some strange little tourna¬ ment down in London, the Chancellor will deliver what is widely expected to be one of this toughest budgets to date. Maybe my years in this job have made me cyn¬ ical. But wouldn’t it be a splendid day to bury bad news? □□□□□ TEN years ago this week, we had the radio on in the office when it was an¬ nounced London would host the 2012 Olympic Games. A very bright young girl who was on work experience at the time asked if this would put Britain at risk of terrorism. “No chance, it’s seven years away, the terror threat will be long over by then,” was more or less what I said in reply. How stupid those words seem now. □□□□□ IN his own inimitable and respect¬ ful style, armchair revolutionary Russell Brand declared that the Tunisian mas¬ sacre was all David Cameron’s fault, and that the minute’s silence held in honour of the victims was ‘complete bullshine’. Only in slightly different terminology. Well Russell, my old son, what I sug¬ gest is that you choose what you consid¬ er a more worthy cause, something dear to your heart. It can be anything, global capitalism, multinationalism, the soaring cost of burlesque outfits, whatever you like. And then observe a period of silence in recognition of it. More than a minute’s silence, I suggest. Two or three years should do the trick. □□□□□ ALL of two days of sunshine, and the moaners were out in force. The unions started banging on about temperatures in the workplace, the rail companies warn¬ ing about bending tracks, it’s amazing the schools didn’t jump onto the bandwag¬ on and say it is too hot for the kids. Two days, that’s all we had before it started raining. Stop complaining and enjoy it. □□□□□ OF course summer also means the fes¬ tival season is upon us, where thousands of students and ageing hippies show their disdain for materialism and capitalism by paying 70 quid or more to giant multina¬ tionals to camp in a field for two days listening to bands nobody has heard of. It looks as though they took it a bit fur¬ ther in Flaxley, Gloucestershire, where around 500 free-love fans attended a giant wife-swapping festival. Apparently, one or two of the neighbours were a bit perturbed, particularly one who found a gatecrasher climbing over his fence. The banners declaring ‘three is the magic number’ and the sex-toy trade stands raised one or two eyebrows as well. The event was called Swingfields. I wonder how many people would have thought this was a Glenn Miller festival? Pets were adopted by the regiment and became mascots Josephine Freed with the photo album she found in a cupboard A photo of an unknown couple’s wedding from the album Regimental riddle of historic photo album Taking the strain at a regiment sports day Troops on a three-day march from Ranikhet to Kathgodan in India in 1939 Grafting in the heat during training in India IN the pages of a beautifully pre¬ served album discovered in a cup¬ board at a Burntwood home, an¬ other world has been captured. The album illustrates the story of the South Staffordshire Regiment captured over a decade between 1935 until the end of the Second World War - although most of the photographs were taken before the conflict started. Also contained in its pages, interspersed with tracing paper to preserve the images, are family snapshots, including wedding pictures. There is also an order-of-service programme from a 1956 reunion dinner. But mystery surrounds the original owner of the album. It was found by Josephine Freed in the back of a cupboard at her Burntwood home two months ago as she was packing to move house. She remembered it had been lent to her father, Mystery surrounds the original owner of a photo album found in a cupboard in Burntwood. MARION BRENNAN reports who served with the Staffordshire Regiment during the last war, shortly before he died. She took it for safekeeping and forgot about it. She thought she had lost it until she started clearing her cupboards for the move. The mother-of-two, who now lives in Pel- sall, said: “It was wonderful to come across it. When I saw all these unbelievable pictures in perfect condition, I felt I must reunite it with its owner or their family or, if not, give it to a museum. “It’s intriguing to see the mixture of family and regimental pictures. Whoever took them was obviously very committed to the Staf¬ fordshire Regiment.” Very brief captions on some of the pictures reveal that some of the photographs were taken in Egypt, India and Norway. In India, the regiment helped in the after- math of the Quetta earthquake of 1935 and intervened in the Cawnpore riots. A history of the South Staffordshires shows that in Oc¬ tober 1930 they were posted to Cairo before moving in 1932 to the pleasant southern hill station of Bangalore in India. Influence In February 1936 the 2nd South Staffords moved on to Cawnpore, a regimental base during the Indian Mutiny, which became a large mill town subject to violent local rioting. A history of the regiment records: “There is little doubt that the restraining influence of those steady, well-disciplined troops prevented serious disturbances and probably saved many lives.” The last station in India was Nowshera in the North-West Frontier Province, where the album documents sports days between the troops. But as threats of invasion increased at home, units were called back to Britain in June 1939 without their families. Some of the album’s pictures show the soldiers training in the North-West Frontier Province as the likelihood of war increased. There are also extraordinary images taken in Norway in 1945. Jeff Elson, lead researcher for the Stafford¬ shire Regimental Museum at Whittington, says the Staffords were sent to Norway at the end of the war to take the surrender from the Germans. He added: “The inter-war periods of service were maintaining the old empire which came crumbling down after the Second World War. “It is little documented, so this album, if not claimed, will go into our archives and is very gratefully received.” Anyone with information about the album can email newsdesk@expressandstar.co.uk or call 01902 319881. ^1 andywoo Windows & Conservatories Established 15 years Ask for our prices on Conservatories Porches Patio Doors & Fascia Boards in White, Golden Oak and Woodgrain All windows and doors come with high security locking systems as standard j All our Windows Doors and Conservatories carry a FREE 10 year insurance backed guarantee ITii I f Trade + DIY Enquiries Welcome We also do a range of composite doors OPEN 7 DAYS: Mon-Fri 8am-5pm.

CONSULTATION over the future of Staffordshire’s mobile and travelling library service has be¬ gun and will continue until Sep¬ tember 2. People can give their opinions when the mobile or travelling librar¬ ies makes a regular stop at one of 36 drop-in sessions across the county, at the authority’s 43 libraries, or online. Ben Adams, Staffordshire County Coun¬ cil’s cabinet member for learning and skills, said: “Demand for this part of the library service has fallen to the point where less than one per cent of the Staffordshire pop¬ ulation uses it, at a cost of almost £7 every time someone steps on to a library vehicle. “At a time when we are spending milli ons of pounds more on providing care for the old and vulnerable, we cannot justify the current cost. “We have an initial set of ideas, but we are willing to talk to different communities about how these changes would affect them and to listen to alternative suggestions - but we need to hear people’s opinions.” Deprived The initial proposal will focus on prior¬ itising the service for those who need it most. Ideas include maintaining a service for deprived areas and retaining popular stops which are more than two miles from an existing library building. Final proposals will be considered by the cabinet and any changes will be imple¬ mented in April 2016. More information about the proposals can be found at www. Staffordshire. gov.uk/mobilelibraries That consultation concludes a review of opening hours for all the council managed and delivered libraries in the county.

It all started when I ar¬ rived home after an oper¬ ation that left me moving about with great difficulty. She never came up the stairs due to the fact she fell down the first three steps and injured her hip when she was a pup. Now it has got to the point where she has a pillow put on the floor for her to lie on. When I get up to go to the bathroom in the early hours she lifts her head to let me know she is there, then by the time I come back she ap¬ pears to be asleep. In the morning when I get dressed she goes downstairs ahead of me. Where she got the idea from I just don’t know but she has my respect. So much for being a ‘dan¬ gerous’ dog. ROBERT WESTWORTH Rugeley I WAS delighted to read of the former college in Rugeley earmarked to be de¬ veloped into an assisted living complex for the elderly, and even more delight¬ ed that this is supported by Cannock Chase Councillor Frank Allen. The provision of suitable accommo¬ dation for older people is, in my opin¬ ion, vital. I have lived in Norton Canes for almost 50 years, during which time several large and small housing devel¬ opments have grown. There is a large number of Social Housing bungalows and some Social Housing apartments. However no private developments have any small houses, flats or bungalows suitable on an affordable budget. We live in a three-bedroom family home with a large garden, which my husband and I are finding more diffi¬ cult to manage. We do not particularly need supported accommodation, sim¬ ply smaller and more manageable, but any bungalows available for private purchase would be above our budget. I wonder if Mr Allen would be in a position to influence the way in which planning consent for new develop¬ ments could include a percentage of suitable housing options for our grow¬ ing ageing community who wish to purchase a smaller property? JENNIE WOODMAN, Norton Canes We're delighted to letters to the editor see effort rewarded POST ON behalf of Hednesford Town Council, I would like to ex¬ tend our hearty congratulations to Mr Michael Mellor on the receipt of his well-deserved British Empire Medal. We were all thrilled to learn that Mike has been recog¬ nised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours this year for his services to the Chase Arts in Public Spaces (Chaps) organ¬ isation and wider community in Cannock. Mike has worked tirelessly, giving freely of his time as vice-chairman of Chaps, to oversee the Hednesford Mining Memorial project which now stands as a proud tribute to our town and its people’s industrial heritage. He is not only full of fantastic ideas that are well received by all, Mike is willing to commit to the hard work and ded¬ ication to see these ideas brought to fruition. We have been delighted to be able to support Mike’s ef¬ forts over the past few years and will continue to do so in the future. He is a true town champion and we couldn’t be more pleased to see his work acknowledged in this way.

ANTONY DEATH Hednesford Thanks for donations ON behalf of the Burnt- wood, Cannock and Lich¬ field branch of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Asso¬ ciation I would like to say thank you to staff for their co-operation and all the peo¬ ple who so kindly donated to our fundraising collection held at Morrisons, Lichfield, on June 20 and 21. The total amount raised was £879.81. PAT WILLIAMS Collections Secretary Votes were all wasted GRAHAM Wiggin (June 25) says UKIP voters are not Tories. It was claimed vot¬ ing UKIP would harm the Tory vote and let Labour in. The reverse happened and UKIP took votes from Labour and let the Tories in. The 3.8 milli on who voted UKIP were wasted votes, as all they achieved was a soli¬ tary MP, and he was a Tory defector. T R MILLWARD Chasetown Need for food banks is 'embarrassing' I WAS dismayed to see county council leader Philip Atkins celebrating that a food bank in Rugeley has been needed for three years. While the work of these groups has been a lifeline to many and the fantastic work of those selfless volunteers is appreciated by all who have fallen on hard times, it is hypocritical that a leading Conservative politician should be celebrating the need for food banks when it is his par¬ ty’s policies that have resulted in those he refers to as ‘less fortunate’ being reliant on them - including more than a million children in the fifth largest economy in the world. He should be embarrassed that we need food banks at all. PAUL WOODHEAD Co-ordinator Cannock Chase Green Party Horse riders’ disguise only adds to hostility I REFER to the practice of horse riders dressing as police officers and wonder what stupid idea they will dream up next. The ‘mounted police’ division was disbanded in Stafford¬ shire many years ago, so they are fooling no-one. I would also point out that this is obviously designed to give the impression that they are police officers. It is a criminal offence to impersonate a police officer, and I cannot understand why they are allowed to do so. I call on the relevant authorities to stop this idiocy, as it only serves to increase the hostility that already exists between motorists and horse riders.

This rare collection of first¬ hand accounts has been brought together to mark the 200th an¬ niversary of the battle, in which French military leader Napoleon was defeated. Put together by Staffordshire County Council’s Archives Service, the exhibition will be touring se¬ lected libraries in the county until October. It features a memorable quote from Lord Ux¬ bridge, whose right leg was struck by one of the last cannon shots fired during the bloody battle on June 18, 1815. The injury meant that the leg had to be amputated above the knee. He was close to the Duke of Welling¬ ton when he suffered the blow, and exclaimed “By God, sir, I’ve lost my leg!”, to which Wellington is reputed to have replied “By God, sir, so you have!”. Letters, eye witness accounts, a charter praising Uxbridge’s bravery and sufferings, a map of Napoleon’s grave and a diary reporting the battle from the home front are among the documents brought together in the exhibition. The documents include an address from local people in Burton-up- on-Trent, sent to Lord Uxbridge com¬ mending him on his bravery and a letter of response from him to similar praise from the people of Colwich. Henry Paget was the 1st Earl of Uxbridge, whose family were from Beaudesert, and was given the title Marquess of Anglesey in July 1815 in recognition for his services at the battle. Witness Ben Adams, Staffordshire County Council’s cabinet member responsible for archives, said: “The Battle of Wa¬ terloo is one of the most famous bat¬ tles in western history. “It’s a fascinating collection of re¬ cords that offer a valuable insight into the bloody but decisive battle, from the eye witness accounts of British officers to the leisurely musings of a battlefield tourist, while the diary of Mrs Hervey from Acton Trussed also provides a unique account of life on the home front as news of the victory filters through, followed by the sober¬ ing details of the many who had died on the day.” The Bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo 2015 Exhibition library tour programme includes Cannock Library, Manor Avenue, from October 1 to 9 and Rugeley Library, Anson Street, from October 12 to 17.

ADVERTISEMENT STEAMED UP DOUBLE GLAZING? Don’t replace the Frames... just: the Panes! It’s been a crazy few months for Cloudy2Clear Windows. The company which specialises in repairing windows which are steamed up, broken or damaged by replacing the panes - not the frames has grown rapidly as homeowners take advantage of their services. Managing Director Brian Stanley feels that it’s all about service. ‘Our product is simple. If your double glazing is misted up we can replace the glass at a fraction of the cost of a new window, in any type of frame, and with a new 5 year guarantee. But it’s not just about saving people money, although that obviously helps. Many tradespeople have struggled since last year and I honestly feel that during the good times a minority perhaps didn’t focus on customer care as much as they should have done. We make sure we turn up when we say we will, do the job the customer requires and leave their house as clean as a whistle. I often get comments back from customers on how they really didn’t expect that sort of service which, in a way, is very sad for the service industry as a whole.’ Cloudy2Clear service Wolverhampton and the surrounding area and Brian is finding that his approach is a major factor in his success. ‘The truth is that it’s not just the personal satisfaction that I get from doing a good job but also it makes good business sense. I get a huge amount of business from friends and family of people I’ve done work for, which just goes to show how much a little bit of effort is appreciated.’ So, if your windows are steamed up, broken or damaged give Brian a call for a free quotation on 0800 61 21 118 and he’ll be happy to help!

The resulting reports, videos and ratings can be viewed on a new website - www.well-active. co.uk - to help others with disabil¬ ities to get active and involved in their community. Taking a year from start to finish, adults, carers and pupils from Hednes¬ ford Valley High School tested a wide variety of activities to see how suitable they were for people with physical and learning disabilities. The students then worked with film makers, web creators and graphic de¬ signers to create visuals to promote the activities available in and around the district. Useful During the process, many of them visited venues for the first time to assess their suitability, or tried out a variety of activities, from wheelchair ice-skating to walking the Heritage Trail. The resulting website, produced with the help of Staffordshire County Council and WLCT’s Community Wellbeing Arts team, which carries out services on behalf of Cannock Chase Council, now provides local residents and carers with a useful tool that helps them choose suitable activities. The group also wanted to inspire local providers to further develop or improve their services, and show other people with disabilities that they can make their own decisions, boost their personal confidence and get fit and healthy. The website complements the Staf¬ fordshire Cares and Staffordshire Mar¬ ketplace websites. On-the-spot advice about leading healthy, active lives in local communities can be found at www.staffordshirecares.info while www. staffor dshiremarketplace .co .uk lists a host of available local services. County Councillor Mark Sutton, cab¬ inet support member for social and healthcare, said: “We understand that living healthy lifestyles is more than just about being healthy. “It’s about connecting communities and enjoying life. We want everyone in the county to enjoy a life which in¬ volves not just living here, but enjoy¬ ing the space, facilities and community opportunities around them.” Hednesford Valley High School pupil Ryan Smith, 19, worked on the project and said: “The Well Active pro¬ ject was an amazing experience. I got the chance to try things I’d never done before and help to create something the whole community can use.” Anita Rattan, headteacher, said: “Creating the Well Active website gave the students at Hednesford Valley High experiences of working with dif¬ ferent professionals, extending their creative work in school and exploring new leisure opportunities, giving them the confidence to try new things for wellbeing and leisure. The students have experienced a complete process from concept to outcome.” THE FIRESIDE FACTORY MASSIVE - OUT OF SEASON FIREPLACE J SALE'S 100s OF FIREPLACES, FIRES, SURROUNDS & STOVES From £399 to over £10,000 UP TO SELECTED FIREPLACE SUITES BIGGEST CHOICE - BEST QUALITY - LOWEST PRICES ALWAYS I OPEN TO THE PUBLIC • FREE SURVEYS • FREE DELIVERY • EXPERT FITTING ^ fireside FACTORY 1st Floor, Units 6 & 7 Norton Canes Business Park, Norton Green Lane, Norton Canes W511 955 Tel: 01543 277366 www.firesidefactory.webs. Tuesday - Friday 9am-5pm Sat10am-4pm Sunday and Monday - CLOSED Pupils and teachers in step for charity Teaching staff get in on the act during the Dress up and Dance 2015 event at Etching Hill Primary School ETCHING Hill Primary School pupils and staff danced themselves into raising more than £600 for charity. The Dress up and Dance 2015 event was organised by the pupil-led school council, who say they are delighted with the success of the afternoon. Each class had worked hard perfecting their moves to a variety of genres, all to be performed for parents and fam¬ ilies. A total of £642.61 was raised for Macmillan Cancer Sup¬ port. The school’s headteacher Mrs Marie Smith said: “We captured a real community spirit thanks to those parents and family members who were able to come along and sup¬ port us. “Of course, raising such a generous total to donate to Macmillan Cancer Support was the best part of all,” she added. “Thank you once again to all who took part and sup¬ ported this incredibly worthwhile cause.” Help for families extended A PROGRAMME aimed at turning around the lives of families in Staffordshire is being extended following its success. Almost 1,400 families in the county have so far benefited from the Building Resilient Families and Communities Programme. It aims to help so-called ‘troubled’ families get back into work and school, reduce anti-social behav¬ iour, and keep young people especially from committing crime. The programme involves organi¬ sations such as the county council, district and borough councils, police, health and housing bodies and the vol¬ untary sector. Professionals from across the public sector work with families in a num¬ ber of ways, from giving guidance on finding employment to helping them to get children to attend school. These measures are designed to provide fam¬ ilies with intensive help, stop problems escalating, and prevent further cost to the public purse. It is estimated that the programme has saved organisations across Staf¬ fordshire around £16 million in the last two years. It is now being extended, with the hope that the lives of nearly 5,000 fam¬ ilies can be turned around within the next five years. www.selectwindows.co.uk Select Summer Sale] For details and conditions contact Select Windows &rl He \\nr. iuv^l 6 Windows plus composite door from £8.81 per week Conservatory from £13 week per S ek Orangery from £40.37 per week Windows from Composite door ^ from £3.26 per week week per Select Windows f h M 1 II B-W MM m Head Office: Select House, Walsall Road, =j GO |S -ci j { Walsall Wood, Walsall WS9 9AQ g Open: Mon-Fri 9.00am - 5.00pm Sat 10.00am - 4.00pm Sunday Appointments Only nsa| ~nmt ^ ■ ■ ^umpa.7 a by Design' Licence No offer to be used in conjunction with any other offers.

Lichfield Camera Club’s sum¬ mer exhibition is being staged un¬ til July 26. It consists of stunning photographs taken by members of the club, with Scotland’s Forth Bridge in fog, and the street scene in Dubrovnik, Croatia on show along with various nature shots. Club chairman Grace Mason said: “There are around 100 shots in this exhibition, which we hold in July every year. “We take a wide range of photo¬ graphs. We have got members doing everything from macro shots - very close up shots of animals and insects - to landscape photographs, all with a huge range of cameras, from small compact and bridge cameras to digital DSLR cameras. There’s a very wide range of skills too.” Wildlife When she first joined the club, Mrs Mason was a complete beginner with the camera. Now, after only nine years, she is an avid photographer who enjoys taking shots of wildlife in its natural habitat. She added: “It is very much a hobby. In 2006 I bought my first digital cam¬ era and started taking snapshots. I hadn’t got a clue what I was doing at first but now it has become an obses¬ sion. “The club has been running for about 75 years now and there are about 60 members. We are a friendly club and always make new members and visitors very welcome.” Lichfield Camera Club meets weekly on Wednesday nights during the sea¬ son, which starts in September and runs through until June, with a varied programme that includes a mixture of guest speakers, competitions, and tui¬ tion evenings. Meetings had been held at Longdon, near Rugeley, for seven years, but from September 9, from 8-10pm, will move back to Lichfield, to the Method¬ ist Church in Backcester Lane. Lich¬ field Camera Club held its annual end of season awards last weekend, with a barbecue and presentation ceremony for competition-winning members. The summer exhibition is now in its second week at Chasewater. It is on every day, from 9am to 6pm Monday to Friday and from 10am to 5pm at weekends. Admission is free. Quality assured ...

BRINDLEY HONDA MOTORCYCLES 01902 690586 West Street, off Stafford Road, Wolverhampton WV1 0 6HT (next to Wickes) www.brindleyhondabikes.co.uk HONDA Coach boss in call for action at blackspot A COACH firm owner is calling for traffic calming measures to be introduced at an ac¬ cident blackspot in Cheslyn Hay. Dave Parry’s call comes after a woman was left critical in hospital following a crash at the junction of Upper Landywood Lane and Landywood Lane. Four passengers needed hospital treatment after last Tuesday’s two-car collision. Fire crews had to cut one car open to reach the casualties. Mr Parry, who owns Par- rys International Tours, said something needed to be done. He owns a home on the corner of Landywood Lane and said the accident was just one of many that had happened on the busy bend, just yards from his garage. He said: “The crash last week is another bad ac¬ cident on this corner and more injuries. “It is without doubt an ac¬ cident blackspot and a new layout or island needs to be built to reduce the risk of further accidents. “It was a nasty accident with three ambulances, fire engines and a number of po¬ lice cars attending.” Safer The businessman added: “There have been a number of accidents here and the wall of the house has been badly damaged twice.” “A simple answer for this dangerous corner is an is¬ land. This would slow traf¬ fic down, and make it a safer junction from all directions. “This is a very busy road with main access to the area and to the railway station. It is also busy with pedestri¬ ans who have awful walking conditions.” “We have written to the council about how bad it is but the answer was no funds available. Yet less important things have gone ahead,” he added. “No doubt nothing will be done about this junction - but the last thing we want is speed bumps.” The crash involved a red Ford Fiesta and a grey Volkswagen Golf. A 49-year- old woman from Walsall was The scene of the crash critical. A 31-year-old man, also from Walsall, has been bailed on suspicion of drink driving. A 73-year-old male driver of the other car, who is from Walsall, is stable after suffering chest and pelvic injuries and a 68-year-old Walsall woman has since been released from Royal Stoke University Hospital. Debris was strewn across the carriageway, which was closed for more than two hours. One of the cars was barely recognisable due to damage. However, the council said it was not a junction that was currently being investi¬ gated as a problem spot. County councillor Mark Deaville, cabinet support member for highways and transport said: “I am always very concerned to hear of any accident and the safety of our roads is my major pri¬ ority. “There has been one re¬ corded incident at this loca¬ tion in the last five years, so it is not currently a location that is under investigation. “However, we will look at the data relating to the most recent incident to see if any action needs to be taken.” Police are appealing for witnesses to the collision. Call 101, quoting incident number 779 of June 30. Medieval church fair A MEDIEVAL fare is one of the features of the St Luke’s 900 Festival in Cannock. It starts at 10am on Saturday.
