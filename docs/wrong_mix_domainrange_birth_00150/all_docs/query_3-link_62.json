        "text": "12-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is reportedly in negotiations with fellow player Nenad Zimonjic about a potential coaching partnership.\n\nAccording to information obtained by Serbian news site Telegraf, the potential partnership will only occur if 40-year-old Zimonjic meets a series of conditions. One of those include him formally ending his professional career. Doubles specialist Zimonjic became world number one in November 2008 and has won three grand slam titles in the discipline. He is currently ranked 61st in the world.\n\nDavis Cup team-mates Djokovic and Zimonjic have played doubles together four times in 2016, including the Rio Olympic Games. Earlier this year Zimonjic said playing alongside the former world No.1 in Rio was a ‘phenomenal thing.’ Away from the court, the two men are close friends.\n\n“I mostly hang out with Janko Tipsarević, Novak Đoković and Viktor Troicki. We have spent many beautiful moments together. We are always in contact and supporting each other.” Zimonjic said earlier this year.\n\nIt is understood that Djokovic’s potential new collaboration was inspired by his time spent with Dusan Vemic. Vemic was the former coach and sparring partner of the world number two until August 2013. According to The Telegraf, having a fellow Serbian back in Djokovic’s camp would make it logistically easier for him.\n\nDjokovic is currently without a primary coach since parting ways with Boris Becker after three years. During their time together the Serbian won 25 ATP titles, including six grand slam trophies and 14 Masters 1000 tournaments. Despite the removal of Becker, Djokovic has opted to continue his work with longtime coach Marian Vajda, who has been part of his team since 2006.\n\nWith no official comment regarding the potential appointment of Zimonjic, it is expected that Djokovic will start his new season guided by Vajda. His first tournament of 2017 will be at the Qatar Open in the first week of January.\n\nHolger Rune will have a second medical opinion on Monday before deciding if he is fit enough to play at the Olympic Games, according to his team.\n\nThe Danish world No.17 recently retired from his quarter-final match at the Hamburg Open due to a knee injury. The hope at the time was that his withdrawal would be just a precautionary measure ahead of the Olympics. However, he is also dealing with a second issue that appears to be more serious.\n\nAccording to TV 2 Sport, Rune has been struggling with a wrist issue and underwent a scan on Sunday which his mother Aneke says ‘doesn’t look promising.’ Aneke is also the manager of her son’s career. Rune’s Olympic dreams now rest on the outcome of a second medical expert that he will visit tomorrow who has a better understanding of the sport.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does not look promising after the first medical opinion after the review of the scan of the wrist,” Aneke Rune told TV 2 Sport.\n\n“We are waiting for two tennis-specific doctors who will give a second opinion tomorrow (Monday). Tennis wrists look different from regular wrists, so we’ll hold out hope for one more day.”\n\nRune is one of three Danish players entered into the Olympic tennis event along with Caroline Wozniacki and Clara Tauson. The country has only won one medal in tennis before which was at the 1912 Games when Sofie Castenschiold won silver in the women’s indoor singles event.\n\nSo far this season, the 21-year-old has won 27 matches on the Tour but is yet to claim a title. He reached the final of the Brisbane International and then the semi-finals of three more events. In the Grand Slams, he made it to the fourth round of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nIt is not known when a final decision regarding Rune’s participation in Paris will be made.\n\nPoland’s top player on the ATP Tour is not giving up on his dream of winning a medal at the Olympic Games despite recently undergoing a medical procedure.\n\nWorld No.7 Hubert Hurkacz suffered a knee injury during his second round clash at Wimbledon against France’s Arthur Fils. In the fourth set tiebreak of their clash, Hurkacz dived for a shot but landed badly on his knee and required on-court medical attention. He then played two more points before retiring from the match.\n\nIn a social media post published on Wednesday, the 27-year-old confirmed he underwent a procedure on his knee earlier this week but didn’t provide any further details. Although Hurkacz has stated his intention to play at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, where the tennis event will be held on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\n“I had a knee procedure this Monday, but I’m feeling better already and my team and are dedicating extensive time each day to the rehab process.” He wrote on Instagram.\n\n“It’s a dream for every athlete to represent their country at the Olympics, and I want to make sure I am fully fit and ready before making the final decision to step on court. The aim is not only to participate, but to win a medal for my country.”\n\nSo far this season Hurkacz has won 34 out of 48 matches played on the Tour. He won the Estoril Open in April and was runner-up to Jannik Sinner in Halle.\n\nThe Olympic tennis event is scheduled to begin a week Saturday on July 27th. Poland is yet to win a medal in the event but expectations are high with women’s No.1 Iga Swiatek also taking part.\n\nIt must have seemed like the whole world was against her when Barbora Krejcikova served for the match for a third time against crowd favorite Jasmine Paolini.\n\nBut Krejcikova was only going for her 12th Grand Slam title. She was well prepared.\n\nSo, she released her patented way-out-wide serve to the smallish Paolini’s backhand, and the best the Italian could do was get her racket on the ball enough to return the serve far off the court, long and wide.\n\nARMS UP FOR A CHAMPION\n\nThe weight of the world was gone as Krejcikova threw her arms over her head and calmly walked to the net to greet the Wimbledon runner-up.\n\nNow, Krejcikova was half-way home to a career Grand Slam in singles. She already owns a career Grand Slam in doubles among her dozen Grand Slam titles that also include one mixed doubles Grand Slam title.\n\nShe has won the hard ones, the French Open on clay and Wimbledon on grass.\n\nAt 28 years old, anything must look possible to this 5-10 Czech.\n\nKREJCIKOVA COMES THROUGH UNDER PRESSURE\n\nPaolini simply was out played in a second straight Grand Slam final, on clay and on grass. Now she faces the real tests, two straight Grand Slam tournaments on hard surfaces that might not be overly friendly to the 5-4 Paolini.\n\nBut there it was, a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory for Krejcikova on Wimbledon’s famed Center Court.\n\nAfter what might be called a throw-away second set for Krejcikova, she came alive in the third set, pinning Paolini to the deep corners while nailing low hard-hit balls to both corners.\n\nKrejcikova got off to 40-0 starts on her first four service games of the decisive set and ended all four with service winners to take a 5-3 lead (with the aid of the only service break of the third set). She yielded only one point in those four service games, a double fault at 40-0 that was followed by an ace.\n\nOf course, it was the serve again that saved the day for Krejcikova and gave her set points two and three, then sealed the deal for a spot in Wimbledon history.\n\n—\n\nJames Beck was the 2003 winner of the USTA National Media Award for print media.
