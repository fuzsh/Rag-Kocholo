        "text": "THE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nWIMBLEDON, England — Canadian Daniel Nestor and Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic remain on track to defend their Wimbledon men’s doubles title.\n\nThe second-seeded pair eliminated Jonathan Marray and Jamie Delado of Britain 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 Monday to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nNestor, a Toronto native, and Zimonjic will face Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Austrian Oliver Marach in the final eight.\n\n\"If we want to defend this title we have to lift our level from now on,\" said Nestor. \"We have something to prove in the quarters since Kubot and Marach knocked us out of the Australian Open.\"\n\nNestor and Zimonjic produced 10 aces and converted five of nine break chances.\n\nBut the British duo provided stiff opposition in the early stages, breaking Zimonjic in the 10th game to make it 5-5 in the first set. Nestor and his partner got that back a game later then broke once more to take the set.\n\n\"Those guys played a good match and we had to do well to get on top of them,\" said Nestor. \"We had our chances and didn’t take all of them.\"\n\nThe pace quickened in the second set with the teams exchanging early breaks before Marray lost serve to trail 4-5. A volley winner on set point a game later gave Nestor and Zimonjic a 2-0 lead.\n\nNestor and Zimonjic failed to hold onto an early break in the third set but soon broke back to make it 3-4. Nestor then held serve to make it 5-3 and the defending champions they closed it out two games later."
