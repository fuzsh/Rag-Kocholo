        "text": "Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic retained their men's doubles title with a four-set victory over top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan on Centre Court today.\n\nNo2 seeds Nestor and Zimonjic won two of three successive tie-breaks and then finally broke in the early stages of the fourth set to triumph 7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.\n\nIt was a second grand slam title for the Canadian-Serbian partnership, who lost in the final of the French Open last month, and Zimonjic said: \"It's just huge to win this with great champions surrounding me. It's an amazing feeling to defend the title and go home undefeated.\"\n\nNestor, who has won the other three grand slams with Mark Knowles, added: \"We came together to play because we thought we had a greater chance of winning grand slams and we've won two already.\"\n\nThe Canadian also paid tribute to the Bryan twins, who have now lost three of their four Wimbledon finals. \"We feel fortunate to beat the Bryans,\" he said. \"They're great champions, they'll be around for a long time.\""
