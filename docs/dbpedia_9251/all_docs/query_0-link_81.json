        "text": "Derrick Brinkley was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to a family of 13 and has made his mark in the music industry. Derrick recorded his first solo album entitled, “Glorious Day” which later became the first under Tyscot Records Inc. to be nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1993, he released a second album entitled, “Hold On” which was produced by Take Six and Ben Tanker and was subsequently nominated for a Stellar Award. In 1996 he released his third album entitled, “Say Yes” which was recorded under Tyscot Records. His release, “Songs in the Key of Praise” is guaranteed to enrich the lives of every listener who hears it. Derrick Brinkley has performed in the United States and England with such well-known gospel artists such as: The Winans, Cece Winans, the late Rev. James Cleveland, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong to name a few.\n\nShortly after, God elevated Derrick Brinkley further into the entertainment industry by releasing a calling on His life to write gospel plays. God orchestrated Derrick’s playwright and musical talents to reach thousands of people over the United States. After traveling nationally from 1990 to 2005, touring and performing Gospel plays such as, “I Need a Man”, “Wicked Ways”, “Mama Don’t”, and “No Place To Lay My Head.” Now, the Lord Jesus Christ is bringing out new-found talents in Derrick: not only is he a Pastor, husband, father, song-writer, arranger, producer, pianist, organist, singer, actor, and also a playwright. Derrick Brinkley has produced hit plays such as, “Which Way Do I Turn”, “What’s Love Got To Do With It”, “A Woman’s Revenge”, and “Guilty Til’ Proven Innocent.” These hit stage plays were performed in every major city in the United States that was written, produced, and directed by Derrick and his wife, Celeste Brinkley.\n\nGod, in His marvelous plans, called Derrick Brinkley and his wife to the life of leadership. After God transitioned Pastor and First Lady Brinkley within two years of establishing the ministry, in 2007, Pastor and First Lady Derrick Brinkley received a Word from God concerning the name of the church God destined them to begin—Spirit of Excellence. Derrick & Celeste Brinkley are the Senior Pastor and First Lady of Spirit of Excellence, Church of God in Christ, Inc. (C.O.G.I.C.) located at 750 Alter Road in Detroit, Michigan. With the church now being manifested, Pastor and First Lady Derrick Brinkley started their ministry with just themselves and their three sons. Following a mighty move of God, Spirit of Excellence began to rapidly grow. After moving from two locations, Pastor and First Lady Derrick Brinkley were blessed to further their ministry in their own building, which is now the current location of the church– growing and touching the lives of the community while building the Kingdom of God. It was only evident that because of Derrick Brinkley’s faithful stewardship, God would see fit to extend his pastoral call into his musical gift, being a mighty blessing to the world. For this reason, God chose to position Derrick Brinkley to step out into gospel music entertainment once again, marking September 5, 2014 the date of his new single release entitled “Grace”, written and produced by one of his very own sons Bernard Brinkley. This is not a stepping stone for Derrick Brinkley but a milestone into a newly found journey as a Pastor and Gospel Music Artist.\n\nOnce Derrick found his “pretty girl,” he knew she was the one; after 27 years of marriage, they have withstood the test of time. If you were a church-going person or affiliated with (C.O.G.I.C) in any manner, then I’m sure you’ve seen this little face. Not only is Celeste a wife, mother of three (La’Bron, Derrick Jr. and Bernard), First Lady, singer, missionary, business consultant, and a playwright, she also supports her husband in whatever he does; she is convinced that he is a MAN OF GOD! Celeste has been featured in both of her husband’s albums, “Glorious Day” and “Hold On.” She has appeared in several plays such as, “I Need A Man”, “Wicked Ways”, “No Place To Lay My Head”, “Mama Don’t”, “Which Way Do I Turn”, “A Woman’s Revenge” and “What’s Love Got To Do With It.” She believes the works of Acts 4:12: only what you do for Christ will last and that’s why she has had her missionary/evangelist license for over 10 years. She sings, directs the choir, ministers the Word of the Lord, and stays active in the church. Celeste feels that people need direction in the day and time we are living in. One of her greatest accomplishments is counseling married couples and successfully helping them to remain together. God continues to use Derrick and Celeste in so many ways and avenues and prays that you are blessed by them!"
