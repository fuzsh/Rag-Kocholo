        "text": "Vanessa Bell Armstrong is one of the greatest and most beloved gospel vocalists of the the past 40 years. She is a seven-time Grammy nominee and Stellar Award winner who has scored such gospel radio hits as \"Peace Be Still,\" \"You Bring Out The Best In Me,\" and \"Pressing On.\" One of the rare gospel artists to have had pop success, she also appeared in the Broadway play \"Don't Get Me Started\" and sang the theme song for the television series \"Amen.\" Today is Vanessa's highly anticipated first album in a decade. Featuring production from such gospel notables as John P. Kee and Donald Lawerence, the album delivers her patented mix of traditional \"church\" and contemporary styles."
