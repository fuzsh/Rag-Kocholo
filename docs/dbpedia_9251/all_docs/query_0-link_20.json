        "text": "Celebrities, radio personalities and a nationwide community of urban, R&b and gospel music fans raised $1.5 million during the 13th annual Urban Radio Cares for St. Jude Kids fundraising broadcast on March 11-12 to support patients battling cancer and other life-threatening diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nThe radiothon included support from all 13 Radio One markets, as well as several partner stations owned by Cumulus, Entercom, Townsquare, Perry Broadcasting, Beasley and iHeart urban AC, gospel, and hip hop radio outlets. This collective effort reached listeners in 33 cities, including Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston, St. Louis, Savannah, Buffalo, Charlotte, Washington, DC, and Memphis.\n\nThe event brought together participating celebrities for the St. Jude mission, including, Anita Wilson, Anthony Hamilton, Brian Courtney Wilson, Cynthia Bailey, Evvie McKinney, Fred Hammond, Isaac Carree, Jekalyn Carr, Keshia Knight Pulliam, Lecrae, Lisa Knowles-Smith, Malcom Stewart, Maranda Curtis, Marvin Sapp, Melvin Crispell III, Mya Johnson, Q Parker,...\n\nBefitting a woman whose influence spanned decades and genres, Aretha Franklin’s eight-hour memorial service on Friday encompassed just about everyone and everything. In the 4,000-seat Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, Franklin was eulogized by former presidents, entertainment titans, and religious figures: From Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Reverend Jesse Jackson to Clive Davis and Franklin’s grandchildren, every aspect of her life was represented.\n\nLetters from both Barack Obama and George W. Bush were read aloud. (Franklin, wrote Obama, reflected the “very best of the American story.”) Performers...\n\nThe Queen is dead. Love live the Queen. Soul superstar Aretha Franklin is being laid to rest this morning in Detroit, and you can follow her funeral service live above. The private event will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson and many others over the course of five hours or more.\n\nThe service for the Queen of Soul, who died August 16 at 76, is being held at the Motor City’s Greater Grace Temple, the same church where Franklin sang at civil rights icon Rosa Parks’ funeral in 2005.\n\nA minute-by-minute schedule for the service is below.\n\nThe lineup of performers also includes Faith Hill, Ronald Isley, Yolanda Adams, Jennifer Holliday, Fantasia, a number of gospel singers and Franklin’s son Edward.\n\nPresidents Bill Clinton is among those set to speak at the service, and the Rev. Al Sharpton will read a letter from Barack and Michelle Obama. Also...\n\nDanny Glover says he's got the perfect tune to sing at Aretha Franklin's funeral -- it's a gospel classic, but it doesn't appear to be one the Queen of Soul covered herself. We got the \"Lethal Weapon\" star Wednesday at The Palm in Bev Hills and asked what should be performed Friday by the star-studded lineup -- which will feature Ariana Grande, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia, Faith Hill and others. Danny's...\n\nJennifer Hudson – Aretha Franklin’s personal choice to play her in a biopic – is just one of the performers set to pay tribute at the Queen of Soul’s private funeral in Detroit next Friday.\n\nStevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, Fantasia, Faith Hill, various gospel stars and Franklin’s son Edward are also on the list released today by Aretha’s longtime publicist Gwendolyn Quinn. See the full roster below.\n\nThe Aug. 31 service is planned for 10 a.m. at Detroit’s Greater Grace Temple. A public viewing will be held Tuesday and Wednesday at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, and a public concert is set for the Chene Park amphitheater Thursday.\n\nThe line-up for the funeral service is: Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia, Shirley Caesar, Ronald Isley, Chaka Khan, Yolanda Adams, Jennifer Holliday, Edward Franklin, and gospel stars Tasha Cobbs-Leonard, The Williams Brothers, Marvin Sapp,...\n\nHollywoodNews.com: Business is business and family is family. I love my daughter and am very proud of who she is and all that she has achieved.

Now, Matthew says the decision was mutual.\n\n\"The decision for Beyonce and Music World Entertainment to part was mutual,\" Matthew Knowles said. \"We did great things together, and I know that she will continue to conquer new territories in music and entertainment.\"\n\nGreat things, indeed.
