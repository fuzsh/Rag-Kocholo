        "text": "Grace Emmanuel Baptist Church will host its 2nd Annual Legacy of Grace Mother’s Day Concert on Friday, May 10, 2024, at 6 p.m. This year’s gospel concert includes gospel icons Vanessa Bell Armstrong, the legendary Elder Rudolph Stanfield and the Voices of Grace Emmanuel, The Canton Spirituals, Bishop Neal Roberson, the Shelby 5 and Flint’s own Antwain Alexander.\n\n“We are excited to bring gospel icons back to the city of Flint this year, “ said Dr. Rabon L. Turner, senior pastor of Grace Emmanuel.\n\nTurner added: “Grace Emmanuel wants to provide area families an opportunity to see top-notch talent and we want everyone to make this special event part of their Mother’s Day memories this year absolutely free.”\n\nThis year, in addition to the powerful line up of performers, Grace Emmanuel has also included area youth interest groups from local sororities and fraternities including Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\n“We want to ensure that concert attendees from across the state have an opportunity to see some of the wonderful things that our youth are doing in the city of Flint,” Turner said. “And, we are hoping to inspire our young people to come out and support their friends who have a chance to share the stage with legendary gospel performers from across the country.”\n\nDoors will open at 5 p.m., with the concert beginning promptly at 6 p.m. Parking is available at the church.\n\nGrace Emmanuel was founded in May 1966 by the late Rev. Lindell L. Brady. For nearly 60 years, the church has been a pillar of the community that was recently recognized for its significant outreach efforts to serve area residents by the Flint and Genesee Regional Chamber. Grace Emmanuel Baptist Church has a legacy of actively supporting Genesee County residents as a 211 agency, a food distribution site and emergency basic needs provider."
