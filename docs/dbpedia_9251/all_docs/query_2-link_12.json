        "text": "Today… which ironically enough is the title of Dr. Vanessa Bell Armstrong’s latest project… is very special. Because not only did I get to interview this living legend, but we also talked in the studio like two friends who haven’t seen each other in years.\n\nThough the conversation is about her new project, “Today” Vanessa dropped major jewels about her journey like working with Thomas Whitfield, Walter Hawkins, Donald Lawrence and John P. Kee. Additionally, we talked about how this wasn’t a project on her radar because she didn’t believe she was going to “do anything else.” However, a pivotal conversation with Donald Lawrence shifted her perspective. Personally, I am delighted that it did.\n\nWe discussed her life’s calling, her father’s advice, and how her parents both fostered a sense of godly humility in her.\n\nClick The Pic For The Complete Vanessa Bell Armstrong Interview\n\n“Today” With The Legendary Vanessa Bell Armstrong\n\nThe album “Today” features nine tracks starting with the catchy and uplifting title song. “Today,” written by Tony Jones, Walter W. Millsap III, Vanessa Bell Armstrong, and Teak, and produced by Walter Millsap III and Teak. The song aims to connect with the youth and bridge generational gaps, reveals Vanessa. “It’s a reminder that life is all that you make it and that there is no need to worry because God has everything under control. “All you have to do is just smile and be happy.”\n\n“Today” also features “Lift Him Up,” a song Vanessa claims will “make you shout and dance!” Other tracks like the beautiful gospel ballad “Miracles” and “Because of Your Grace” offer heartfelt testimonies. Meanwhile, “Forever Yours” and “Rely On Me,” both crafted by John P. Kee, resonate with a classic old-school vibe.\n\nA seven-time Grammy nominee and multiple Stellar Award winner, Vanessa has overcome many challenges for herself and her loved ones, including a health issue that made singing difficult for a time. Her song “Walking Miracle,” from her 2007 album of the same name, was inspired by her son’s struggle with multiple sclerosis. Through faith and perseverance, she continued to record subsequent albums and was honored with many other awards… but is only concerned with the reward of having God say, “Well Done”.\n\n“This new album is so special to me,” Vanessa reflects, “because it’s a long time coming. God allowed me to finish it just before my father passed and went to heaven. I dedicate this album to him.” (Shanachie Entertainment)\n\nGet “Today” where you listen to music and find Dr. Armstrong on social media @Dr_VanessaBellArmst Instagram, @vanessabellarmstrong Facebook and on YouTube at Official Vanessa Bell Armstrong!\n\nTune in to The Randi Myles Show from 10 am to 3 pm through The Detroit Praise Network App available on iPhone and Android devices, visit detroitpraisenetwork.com, or use your smart speaker by enabling the skill and saying, “open Detroit Praise Network.” Alternatively, listen on your car, home, or work radio at 105.9 HD2, 98.3 FM, or 99.9 FM.\n\nConnect with us on Social Everywhere @PraiseDetroit!\n\nAbout Randi Myles:\n\nI am a child of God that has a lot to say.\n\nHere you will find conversations with artists, authors, speakers, and teachers within the faith-based community.

Randi’s mom knew she was destined to be in some form of entertainment when even as a small child, she would pretend a pencil was a microphone and sing and charm family and friends. Later she would sing in church and college choirs. However, it wasn’t until she attended Specs Howard School of Media Arts, that Ms. Myles would find her true voice. Randi enjoys writing about the city of Detroit, faith, and the community."
