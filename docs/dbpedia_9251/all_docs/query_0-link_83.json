        "text": "Chris Coleman has been playing drums since the ripe old age of two, sitting on his uncle's knee in church. He traveled with his father and uncles who performed together in a gospel ensemble. He took top honors in his hometown \"Music Appreciation Awards\" at the age of 14, and began traveling throughout the country with several gospel groups including Marvin Winans, Edwin Hawkins, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong - as well as performing with five jazz/variety/show bands.\n\nIn 1999, Chris graduated with honors from the Drummer's Collective. He was offered a scholarship to Berklee School of Music, was accepted into Manhattan School of Music, and received a recommendation from Ed Soph to attend North Texas State. He opted instead to return to his hometown of Saginaw, Michigan to start full-time ministry and ATW Global. He moved briefly to Cleveland to join the instructional staff at Christian Music Academy.\n\nOn December 8, 2001, Chris was honored to win 1st place in the National Drum Competition sponsored by Guitar Center, which hosted 30,000+ drummers. He then came to Atlanta to study Bass guitar at AIM, where he was pleased to accept a position teaching drums.\n\nSince that time, Chris has had a non-stop schedule of work, with highlights that include studio work with Prince, touring and recording with Israel Houghton and the New Breed, touring with Stanly Clarke, Chaka Khan, Rachelle Ferrell, Lee Ritenour, NKOTB and many more. In addition, Chris keeps an extremely busy teaching schedule between Los Angeles and NYC where he teaches at the Drummers Collective.\n\nChris has also appeared at many of the world's top drum festivals, including the Meinl Drum Festival, PASIC, and the Modern Drummer Festival.\n\nALL SALES FINAL.
