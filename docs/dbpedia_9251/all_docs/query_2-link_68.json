        "text": "Multiple GRAMMY® Award nominee and Stellar Award winner Vanessa Bell Armstrong today signed an exclusive recording and co-management agreement with Music World Gospel. Armstrong will be co-managed by Clive Ennis of CAnthony Entertainment.\n\nSince her 1983 debut solo recording, Peace Be Still, Armstrong has had a string of number one hit songs.\n\n“It has been a wonderful journey,” said Vanessa Bell Armstrong. “I am so happy to have a new home with Music World Gospel. I am excited about working with my new team.”\n\nShe has recorded 15 critically-acclaimed and award-winning albums that include a mixture of traditional and contemporary gospel, praise and worship songs, greatest hits and “best of” packages. Throughout her career, she has worked and collaborated with numerous artists, including Pastor Shirley Caesar, Tramaine Hawkins, Yolanda Adams, Fred Hammond, Marvin Winans, The Winans, John P. Kee and the New Life Community Choir, among others. During the late 1980s, Armstrong had success as an R&B recording artist. Her self-titled 1987 album from Jive Records featured the Billboard charting hit “You Bring Out The Best In Me,” as well as the club favorite “Pressing On.” Her other career highlights include her 1987 Broadway debut at the Longacre Theatre, co-starring in Don’t Get God Started with Giancarlo Esposito, BeBe Winans and Chip Fields, among others. In 1989, Armstrong had a cameo role in Oprah Winfrey’s ABC miniseries, The Women of Brewster Place.\n\nShe also recorded “Shine On Me,” the theme song for the NBC hit series Amen. In 2011, at the 26th Annual Stellar Music Awards, Armstrong was presented with the Ambassador Dr. Bobby Jones Legends Award.\n\nArmstrong, who President Barack Obama has said is one of his favorite gospel artists, has a one-of-a kind gospel style and signature sound that is a perfect fit for Music World Gospel. “Vanessa Bell Armstrong is an extraordinary talent with an extraordinary gift,” said Mathew Knowles, founder, President and CEO of Music World Entertainment. “We are honored that she chose Music World Gospel as her new home. She is one of the best vocalists of our time. She has influenced a generation of singers in various music genres. We look forward to continuing to build on her rich musical legacy.”\n\n“Vanessa Bell Armstrong’s journey is a source of encouragement to many,” said Clive Ennis, founder and CEO of CAnthony Entertainment. “She has flourished in several areas of entertainment throughout her remarkable career, making her one of the gospel greats of today. It is truly a privilege to work with such an exceptional individual and we are honored and excited about our new joint venture with Music World Gospel.”\n\nArmstrong was born in Detroit, Michigan and currently resides in Houston, Texas.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nExclusive Interview: Michelle Williams Talks About Forgiveness and Life"
