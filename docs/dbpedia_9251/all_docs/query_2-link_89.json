        "text": "“It’s been described by some as – a structure that is large enough to lovingly accommodate the masses but yet, still small enough to make everyone who enters feel right at home.” On April 30, 2017, The Detroit based Historic Hartford Memorial Baptist Church is celebrating 100 years of God’s service to clergy, members , guests and the community at large.\n\nThe noted event is in conjunction with the combined Usher Ministries, blessed 96th Anniversary celebration featuring the communities’ treasured iconic gospel superstars including Stellar (and other remarkable) award-winning native daughter, Gospel Artist Vanessa Bell Armstrong. I had the privileged to talk to this resilient woman of God about the celebration, healing after loss and the songs that minister to her the most.\n\nCheck it out here: https://randimyles.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vanessa-bell-armstrong-podcast.mp3\n\nALSO HEAR: Anita Wilson’s Upcoming “Sunday Song” Continues Her Unique Approach to Gospel Music & Ricky Dillard Returns to Detroit to Headline “Saturday Night Live” Music Series\n\nLISTEN TO RANDI EACH WEEKDAY FROM 10AM – 3PM ON Praise 102.7 – DETROIT’S INSPIRATION STATION!\n\nFind out more about Randi Here ~~~> About.Me/randimyles2go"
