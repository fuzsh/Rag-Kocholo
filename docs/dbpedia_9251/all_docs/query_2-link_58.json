        "text": "By Ron Wynn\n\nNASHVILLE, TN — Whenever the legendary gospel artist Vanessa Bell Armstrong releases an album it’s big news. On June 21 (Shanachie), her first LP in over a decade, hits the streets. Armstrong acknowledges that this one is a very special part of her impressive recorded legacy with particularly poignant messages and themes.\n\n“I finished this one just before my father passed,” Armstrong told the Tribune during a recent interview. “It’s dedicated to him and to the inspiration and support he provided me throughout my career and my lifetime. I know he’s watching from up above and it’s a blessing that I was able to complete it before he passed on.”\n\nThe 11-song release also serves as an example of Armstrong’s stylistic versatility. It includes everything from a classic style song similar to her huge hit “Peace Be Still,” as well as newer, contemporary sounding numbers and both inspirational and message tunes. “I’m really happy to be releasing this on Shanachie,” she added. “Because they’re the type of label that will give your music the special care and attention it needs in the marketplace, something that’s even more important today because of the impact of social media and streaming.”\n\nA multiple Grammy nominee as well as both a Stellar and Soul Train Music award winner, Armstrong’s excelled in two areas since the mid-‘80s. A native of Detroit, she’s not only had gospel hits, but also enjoyed success on Broadway in the memorable play “Don’t Get God Started” and also on television in the Oprah Winfrey production “The Women of Brewster Place.”\n\nStill Armstrong’s powerful performance singing the theme song to the NBC sitcom “Amen” that co-starred Sherman Hemsley, Clifton Davis and Anna Marie Horsford,” is something that many fans still remember. “I feel so blessed at 70 to still be active and enjoying what I do,” Armstrong concluded. “God has been good to me and I try to reflect that in my music and the way I lead my life.”\n\n“Today” (Shanachie) will be available in all formats.\n\nCopyright TNTRIBUNE 2024.
