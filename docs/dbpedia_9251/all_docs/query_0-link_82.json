It is a direct reflection of Alyssa's personality complete with dark glittery pink paint, featuring all gold hardware, dual humbucker pickups, mahogany body, and maple neck, with custom engraved work dedicated to Alyssa. The guitar was on display in a Museum Exhibit for Operation Check Six for nearly 7 months, at the Hjemkomst Center in Moorehead, Minnesota.\n\nFurthermore, Alyssa is featured on \"Futurebright\" by Ozonic, produced by Producer and Composer Jarrod Headley (Spike, ESPN, CBS), as well as Ed McGee's single \"The Love That We Know\", produced by platinum and gold award-winning Music Producer Bill Douglass.
