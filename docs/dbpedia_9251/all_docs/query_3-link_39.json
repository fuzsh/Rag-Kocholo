        "text": "Anita Wilson, known for her unique vocals and electrifying live shows, is a renowned gospel and soul singer, songwriter, and producer, known for her signature sultry voice and inspiring lyrics. She was born on June 19, 1976, in East St. Louis, Illinois, and as a Baptist Pastor’s baby girl, began singing in the church choir at a young age. Anita was influenced by gospel legends such as The Hawkins Family, The Clark Sisters, Vanessa Bell-Armstrong and The Thompson Community Singers. She was also heavily influenced by The Golden Decade of R&B/Soul - “The 90s” as she developed a passion for music that would shape her career. After moving to Chicago in 1999, Anita worked as vocal coach, worship leader, choir director and most notably as a background vocalist with mentor Donald Lawrence & Co. During this time, Anita began to write and record her own music, and in 2011, she released her debut album, \"Worship Soul.\" The album was a critical success which garnered Anita’s 1st (of three) Grammy Nomination and established Anita as a rising star in music.\n\nAnita has since released several more albums, including \"Vintage Worship\" (2014), \"Sunday Song\" (2017), \"Dance Soul\" (2020) and “Soul Sister” (2021). Her music is known & loved for its unique fusion of gospel and soul. In addition to working with D. Lawrence, Anita has collaborated with many of her musical heroes on her music including Yolanda Adams, Faith Evans, Yvette Flunder, Tommy Sims, B.Slade and closest to Anita’s heart, her late Father, Pastor Fredrick Wilson, Sr. She has worked to support various charitable organizations. Ms. Anita Wilson is a talented and inspiring artist who continues to make a significant impact in the world of gospel and soul music.\n\nFor more information, email Julie Lally at This email address is being protected from spambots.
