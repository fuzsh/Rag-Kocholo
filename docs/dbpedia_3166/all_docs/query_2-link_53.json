        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Days before Elon Musk struck a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion, he said he did not “care about the economics” of the company. As the world’s richest man, with a net worth of more than $250 billion, he indicated that making money from the social media service was far from his prime objective.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Musk was able to get an up-close look at the strength of the business he is buying.\n\nTwitter reported that its revenue was $1.2 billion for the first three months of the year, up 16 percent from a year earlier but lower than a 20 percent growth rate the company had predicted for the year. Profit was $513 million, or about 61 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had expected about $1.2 billion in revenue.\n\nThe social media company said it had 229 million daily active users, up nearly 16 percent from a year earlier.\n\nMr. Musk’s deal for Twitter is expected to close in the next three to six months. Mr. Musk, 50, who also leads the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, has vowed to take Twitter private and make it a haven for “free speech.” In recent days, he has criticized some of Twitter’s top executives who helped build up the company’s policies on what speech should be allowed on the platform and what should not, causing an uproar.\n\nBut even if Mr. Musk says he does not care about Twitter’s business, investors will be scrutinizing the company’s financials to see how it may affect the deal. Investors will be looking at a particular earnings metric of Twitter’s — its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, used widely as a proxy for cash flow — to gauge whether the company can pay off the debt and interest that Mr. Musk’s deal will add to its balance sheet.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
