        "text": "Twitter, now X, launched its Creator Ads Revenue Sharing program in July 2023. The platform pays content creators a portion of their revenue from the ads in the reply section. Are you looking for a Twitter ad revenue calculator to know how much money you’ll rake in from this program?\n\nToday’s article explains how the platform calculates your earnings for your professional Twitter account. It also shows what you must do to get regular payments from this social media channel.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about these topics.\n\nHow Is Twitter Ad Revenue Calculated? A Breakdown of the Payment Program\n\nHow is Twitter ad revenue calculated? The platform uses impressions to determine how much to pay you. Impressions indicate how many times users view your tweet organically. As of June 2024, your posts, over three months, should generate at least 5 million impressions.\n\nX shows ads in your posts’ comments and pays you depending on the impressions these promotional posts receive.\n\nHere are a few things you need to know about the payment calculations:\n\nX only counts the organic impressions the ads receive from verified users. In other words, the people viewing the promotional content must have a blue tick. It doesn’t consider impressions from non-verified users.\n\nThe Twitter ad spend, i.e., the money brands spend on advertising, influences your earnings. If the ad spend is low, it reduces how much you receive from this program.\n\nOnly brand-friendly content will have ads in the comments section.\n\nThe more comments your posts receive, the more ads the platform shows in the replies section.\n\nHow Do You Get Paid on Twitter Ad Revenue Sharing Program? Follow This Guide\n\nHow do you get paid on Twitter after joining the ad revenue sharing program? The guide below explains how to set up payments on X:\n\nSign in to your X account on a desktop browser.\n\nLeft-click Premium on the quick navigation panel.\n\nSelect the Monetization option under Quick Access.\n\nClick on the Set Up Payment Details button.\n\nA popup appears, explaining what you need to do. Click the Connect Stripe Account button.\n\nEnter the email ID connected with your Stripe account and click Continue.\n\nEnter your Stripe account password and left-click the Login button.\n\nYou’ll need to connect your mobile number with Stripe. The payment platform sends a verification code, which you must enter on the site. Skip this step if you already completed this process.\n\nEnter the location and type of business. If you completed this step, you may not see it again.\n\nType your personal details, i.e., legal name, date of birth, and home address. Left-click the Continue button.\n\nYou also have to enter your tax-related information.\n\nEnter your bank account information to add it to Stripe.\n\nReview the information and select Agree and Submit.\n\nThe platform will redirect you to the X settings page if there are no issues. You can confirm the connection between Stripe and X by checking the registered email ID. Twitter only releases the payment after you earn $10.\n\nFAQ: Twitter Ad Revenue Calculator FAQ\n\nThe section below covers common questions people have about ad revenue sharing on X:\n\nTweetDelete Helps Remove Posts That Can Reduce Your Earnings\n\nThis Twitter ads revenue calculator article should clarify any questions you have on this topic. Post high-quality content on these social media platforms regularly to earn from this platform.\n\nAs highlighted earlier, your posts determine how much revenue you generate from this program. People may not view your content if you tweet anything controversial or insensitive.\n\nAlso, if posts break X’s Creator Monetization Standards, X can temporarily prevent you from accessing this service. It may also remove you from this program permanently.\n\nYou need to delete such posts quickly. However, this isn’t easy with X’s default delete feature. Thankfully, with TweetDelete, it has become a one-click process for removing unlimited posts.\n\nYou can use the mass-delete tweets feature for this process. The other option is to use the auto-delete task, which runs in the background.\n\nSet it up by providing the keywords, date ranges, phrases, and hashtags in the posts to delete. TweetDelete will look for tweets that match your criteria and remove them periodically.\n\nThanks to the custom filter, it’s easy to find anything in your profile, regardless of when you posted them.\n\nWith this Twitter ad revenue calculator guide, you shouldn’t have any payment problems.\n\nUse TweetDelete today so your mistakes on X don’t reduce how much you earn from the platform!"
