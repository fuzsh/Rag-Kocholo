        "text": "X, formerly known as Twitter, finds itself in dire straits, with owner Elon Musk once again appealing to advertisers to return amid plummeting revenues since he took over in late 2022.\n\nReports last week indicated that 65 percent of advertisers had supposedly returned to the struggling platform, but internal documents reveal a stark reality: overall revenue has cratered under Musk’s stewardship.\n\nNow, Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino are scrambling to salvage the situation at this year’s Cannes Lions festival in southern France. The Tesla CEO reportedly held meetings with executives from prominent entities such as the NFL, L’Oreal, Qualcomm, and Target, as detailed in recent reporting by the NYT.\n\nHowever, whether these efforts can staunch the bleeding of hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter from X, which has become notorious for hosting hate speech and conspiracy theories, remains uncertain.\n\nMusk’s challenges are compounded by his own controversial statements, including a notorious incident where he publicly told advertisers to “go fuck themselves” last November—a sentiment that likely didn’t endear him to the very executives he now seeks to court.\n\nReflecting on his outburst during the DealBook Summit last year, Musk admitted fault but defended his authenticity over PR-manufactured messaging. In an interview with WPP CEO Mark Read, he conceded, “I do shoot myself in the foot from time to time.”\n\nUnder Musk’s leadership, X has witnessed a disastrous financial performance, with revenue plummeting nearly 40 percent in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. The company reported a staggering $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023 alone.\n\nAs X navigates 2024, the financial documents paint a troubling picture exacerbated by Musk’s penchant for controversy, which includes promoting conspiracy theories, making racist comments, and spreading misinformation.\n\nIn sum, X under Musk’s tenure has become a challenging environment for advertisers, undermining efforts to stabilize its financial health and reputation."
