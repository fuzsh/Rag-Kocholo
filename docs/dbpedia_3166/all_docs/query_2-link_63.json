        "text": "Revenue per employee is a simple measure of efficiency that was previously in vogue in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. It gives companies a chance to assess how productive each employee at their company is on average by dividing revenue by the size of their payroll. A growing number of influential tech executives and investors say tech firms, bloated by over-hiring, should re-prioritize the metric.\n\nSince 2018, Twitter has seen a drastic fall in the revenue generated per employee. The number fell from $776,112 in 2018 to our annualized figure of $634,666 in 2022, illustrating the firm's continued struggles to turn a profit.\n\nAt the same time, Twitter almost doubled its headcount from 3,920 in 2018 to around 7,500.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSince taking over, Musk has laid off thousands of staff and been vocal about focusing on a core of critical engineers, publicly lambasting those whose work appears less than necessary. Insider's Kali Hays reported last month that the billionaire remains highly focused on cost-cutting — sometimes at the expense of Twitter's functionality.\n\nWhen making Twitter's first round of cuts in November, Musk tweeted that \"unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.\" Those who remained were told to expect an \"extremely hardcore\" working culture.\n\nRevenue pressure is particularly acute at the firm given costly interest repayments on the $13 billion of debt Musk took on to finance his buyout. The company's first payment to lenders was completed by the end of January, per the FT.\n\nDespite mixed success in keeping Twitter running smoothly, Musk and his layoffs have been closely watched and replicated across tech. Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and others have subsequently axed thousands of roles in the name of efficiency. Over 157,000 workers have lost their jobs since January this year, according to data from tracker site Layoffs.fyi.\n\nIn a virtual fireside conversation this month with investment bank Evercore, investor and PayPal Mafia member Keith Rabois said he expected revenue per employee to make a return as companies prioritize profitability.\n\nRabois and other hawkish execs have lauded layoffs, saying that many of the jobs being cut mostly revolved around \"fake work\" enabled by companies chasing headcount as a vanity metric.\n\nCorrection: April 4 2023 — A previous version of this story misstated Twitter's revenue-per-employee decline. Based on annualized data for 2022, it is an estimated 18.2%, not 60%."
