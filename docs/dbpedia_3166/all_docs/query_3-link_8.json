        "text": "Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is creating a fresh need to find a path to greater and more consistent profitability for the social media network, and payments represent a vital piece of the puzzle.\n\nLess than a week ago, Elon Musk took ownership of Twitter, after a fraught process that saw the Tesla and SpaceX CEO pay $44bn to purchase the social media platform and take it private.\n\nSince then, Musk has already taken his first steps to overhaul the company’s finances, most notably with the announcement of plans to charge verified users for the privilege of keeping their blue tick status, although by how much seems subject to change. While the amount proposed was initially $20 a month, this was met with largely negative reactions and Musk has since indicated that he is revising this to $8, with some other markets charging less.\n\nThe move is an attempt to broaden Twitter’s revenue, which is currently highly reliant on advertising – much of which is currently uncertain after a number of agencies advised advertisers to pause further spending on the platform until Musk’s plans became clearer.\n\nHowever, it is likely that this is not Musk’s endgame for the platform. While this overhaul of the company’s subscription offering is an attention-grabbing first step, in the long run the company is likely to be far more focused on payments. Not only has Musk, who was key to the early development of PayPal, indicated he plans to prioritise payments on Twitter, including in an investor deck that targeted $1.3bn revenue from payments by 2028, but he maintains close links with the company’s founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, now CEO of Square parent Block.\n\nBut what is the potential of payments for Twitter, and what could Musk’s payments plans on the platform look like? This report explores how the social media platform’s revenues could be transformed by a multifaceted payments strategy – and where Musk may choose to focus his attention.\n\nContents:"
