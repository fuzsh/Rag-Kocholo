        "text": "Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44bn in October 2022\n\nTesla CEO has implemented widespread changes and introduced new features\n\nPlans include video, news, commerce and finance tools\n\nX, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has seen average monthly users fall by 14 per cent and advertising revenue collapse by 54 per cent since Elon Musk acquired the company last October.\n\nMusk completed his US$44 billion takeover in October 2022, promising to make the company more efficient, promote free speech, and create an ‘everything’ app that would expand beyond social media into finance, commerce, and video.\n\nSince then, the Tesla chief executive has spearheaded a programme of job cuts and cost-cutting measures, rapidly implemented new features, introduced new subscription options that include ‘paid-for’ verification, and rebranded the application.\n\nHowever, many users have complained of technical problems, user experience issues, and an increase in online abuse – moves that have negatively affected usage and caused advertisers to suspend or withdraw advertising campaigns.\n\nX chief executive Linda Yaccarino marked the anniversary with a blog post outlining 23 of the new regime’s achievements. However, data published by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) shows Musk’s wide-sweeping changes have had a negative impact on more universally recognised metrics of success.\n\nThe rebrand from Twitter to X has made discoverability more challenging, affecting app downloads, while X trails other social media platforms in terms of advertising growth. Twitter’s active user base also continues to be dwarfed by its competitors in terms of daily active users.\n\nNonetheless, X says its own data shows 1.5 million people are signing up for its platform every day – a year-on-year increase of four per cent – while Yaccarino says 90 per cent of its top 100 advertisers have returned.\n\nIn a bid to drive usage and diversify revenues, X has launched a creator programme, is working on a large screen video app and, according to Bloomberg, plans a news wire service. The company has also confirmed two new subscription tiers that remove adverts, and hopes to have its financial services operating by next year.\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nThese latest figures lay bare the challenge that X has to find new sources of growth and repair reputational damage caused by the chaos of the past 12 months. However, the value of Twitter, or X, has never been in its size but its influence.\n\nX’s user base is hugely engaged and passionate, especially when it comes to sport. It remains an important channel for the sports industry, providing a platform for discussion and engagement, with many rights holders distributing official clips and highlights.\n\nThis is why, despite the well-documented issues, many rights holders are sticking with it for now – and why many advertisers are continuing to invest. Although the National Football League (NFL) has voiced its concerns about its advertising appearing alongside questionable content, it remains committed to a multi-year arrangement with the company.\n\nLast month, the NFL’s chief media and business officer Brian Rolapp attended a meeting of X’s first client council, which outlined the firm’s product roadmap, plans for content partnerships and its work on critical safety, and declared it a “great visit”."
