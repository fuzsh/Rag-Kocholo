        "text": "Twitter is finally adding a new feature that will pay creators. The first Twitter ad revenue sharing payments included a total package of a couple of months, starting from February, and creators who subscribed to the Blue program with at least five million impressions were eligible for the first payouts.\n\nPopular creators are finally receiving an update months after Elon Musk revealed that some Twitter users would be able to make money from the social media platform’s ads: the money will arrive “within the next 72 hours.”\n\nThe Twitter ad revenue sharing scheme is supported by advertisements put in tweet replies and is only accessible to users who pay for a Twitter Blue subscription. Payout payments for accounts with a few million followers have so far ranged from a few thousand dollars to almost $40,000. Twitter claims in a thread that it will increase the number of creators who are eligible later this month.\n\nThis action by Twitter is in line with its overarching objective to support content creators and give them ways to make a living off the platform directly.\n\nEarlier this year, Twitter made it possible for individuals to charge for access to their content, giving producers a new source of income. The Twitter ad revenue sharing program is another option for creators to make money off of the platform.\n\nIt’s important to remember that Elon Musk, the entrepreneur who bought Twitter in October of last year, previously said the firm would give authors 100% of subscription revenue for the first year, excluding payment gateway fees.\n\nWhat is Twitter ad revenue sharing?\n\nTwitter ad revenue sharing is the latest feature added to the platform that helps creators get a share of Twitter’s revenue from the sponsored posts appearing under their tweets. Through this initiative, verified creators can receive a portion of the money made by adverts that are shown in comments on their posts.\n\nThreads vs. Twitter: The ultimate battle has begun\n\nAlthough it’s not immediately obvious how reimbursements are calculated or how much money Twitter keeps for itself, accounts must have received at least 5 million impressions on tweets in the previous three months in order to be eligible.\n\nConservative YouTuber Benny Johnson announced that he was qualified to get close to $10,000; @Elon_alerts, an account that tweets about Musk, stated that their compensation was roughly $2,200. Payouts are cumulative going back to February, when the initiative was first introduced, according to Musk in a tweet.\n\n“For the next 12 months, Twitter will keep none of the money. You will receive whatever money we receive, so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS & Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better, depending on payment processor),” tweeted Musk.\n\nTwitter creator monetization\n\nFinally, Twitter is introducing a new function that will compensate creators. The first Twitter ad revenue sharing payments were made over the course of a few months, beginning in February, and were only available to artists who had signed up for the Blue program and generated at least five million impressions.\n\nAs it would be challenging to decide which creators to compensate for advertisements served in the feed (this is the same issue short-form video platforms like TikTok are encountering with revenue sharing), Twitter is monetizing the advertising shown in tweet replies.\n\nIt follows that artists will naturally want to offer incentives for people to respond to their tweets. The ideal case scenario would be that this would spark dialogue; however, as we are aware from sites like Facebook, strong emotions are what generate the greatest interest.\n\n“We’re expanding our creator monetization offering to include ads revenue sharing for creators. This means that creators can get a share in ad revenue, starting in the replies to their posts. This is part of our effort to help people earn a living directly on Twitter. We’re rolling out the program more broadly later this month, and all eligible creators will be able to apply,” Twitter said.\n\nTwitter monetization countries\n\nLuckily, the Twitter ad revenue sharing program is eligible in every country that Stripe is eligible for a payout. “We are rolling out to an initial group who will be invited to accept payment,” the company added.\n\nBefore this, Twitter had announced its new monetization features. On April 14, the function debuted under the “Subscriptions” menu, but it was only partially functional. All users in more than 110 countries can now access it.\n\nYour Twitter account must have been active for at least three months in order to allow monetization. Additionally, it must have 25 tweets in the previous 30 days and at least 500 followers.\n\nTwitter backtracks on strict login requirements\n\nUntil they reach $50,000 in income, Twitter will let content creators keep up to 92% of their earnings. The user’s revenue share decreases to 80% after that point. Twitter plans to work with the Stripe payment system to coordinate payments.\n\nIn the future, the business stated, “newsletters and other features as potential bonus content” will be added.\n\nTwitter monetization requirements\n\nTo qualify for the Twitter ad revenue sharing program, accounts must have had at least 5 million impressions on tweets over the previous three months, be subscribed to Witter Blue or Verified Organizations, and pass the human review for creator monetization standards. You will need a Stripe account after you are approved for payouts.\n\nHere are the monetization rules that Twitter had shared before:\n\nCreators who monetize on Twitter must meet the following requirements:\n\nYou must reside in a country in which Twitter’s monetization programs are available.\n\nYou must be 18 or older.\n\nYou must have a Twitter account that has been active for at least 3 months.\n\nYou must have a complete profile inclusive of an account name, a bio, a profile picture, and a header image.\n\nYou must have a verified email address. Learn how to verify your email address.\n\nYou must have secured your account with two factor authentication. Learn how to enable two-factor authentication.\n\nYou must not be designated a state-affiliated media account.\n\nYou must be in good standing with Twitter, which means that:\n\nYou have not repeatedly violated the Twitter User Agreement or Twitter’s Content Monetization Standards.\n\nYou have not previously been removed as an advertiser on Twitter for violations of our Ads policies or as an Amplify publisher on Twitter for violations of our Amplify Pre-Roll Guidelines\n\nYou have not previously been removed as an advertiser on Twitter for violations of our Ads policies or as an Amplify publisher on Twitter for violations of our Amplify Pre-Roll Guidelines\n\nYou must feature an authentic identity on your profile. This means that:\n\nYou cannot feature the identity of another person (whether fictional or real), brand, or organization, unless directly affiliated with your brand or organization or a fake identity that is intended to deceive others. This includes parody, fan and commentary accounts.\n\nYou must connect a verified Stripe account.\n\nSubscriptions additional criteria (Learn more about Subscriptions)\n\nMaintain at least 500 active followers or more.\n\nHave posted Tweets in the past 30 days.\n\nComply with the Subscriptions Creator Terms.\n\nHow to get paid on Twitter\n\nTwitter is a powerful platform for sharing thoughts, ideas, and news. But did you know that you can also make money on Twitter, and the Twitter ad revenue sharing program is not the only option?\n\nThere are a few different ways to get paid on Twitter. Here are a few of the most popular methods:\n\nSponsored tweets: This is where you partner with a brand to promote their product or service in a tweet. You can charge a flat fee or a commission on sales.\n\nAffiliate marketing: This is where you promote a product or service on Twitter and earn a commission for each sale that you generate.\n\nSubscriptions: This is where you charge your followers a monthly fee to access exclusive content or features.\n\nTips: This is where your followers can send you money directly through Twitter.\n\nSo, how do you get started making money on Twitter? Here are a few tips:\n\nBuild a following: The first step is to build a large enough following that brands will want to work with you. This means tweeting consistently, engaging with your followers, and sharing interesting and relevant content.\n\nCreate high-quality content: Your tweets should be informative, engaging, and visually appealing. If you create great content, people will be more likely to follow you and pay attention to your ads.\n\nBe authentic: People can spot a fake from a mile away. So, be yourself and be genuine in your interactions with your followers. This will help you build trust and credibility, which are essential for making money on Twitter.\n\nMusk targets AI startups for Twitter data scraping\n\nStripe supported countries\n\nTo be eligible for the Twitter ad revenue sharing program, you must reside in a country that supports Stripe payouts.
