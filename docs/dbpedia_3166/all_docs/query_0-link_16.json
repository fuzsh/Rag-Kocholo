        "text": "X is just a new name for Twitter. But in reality, it’s the same platform, where you share short thoughts, called tweets.\n\nRead on and discover the latest user statistics, average time spent on the platform, and X’s revenue.\n\nTwitter to X\n\nTwitter started in 2006 and quickly became a favorite place for people to share short messages, called ‘tweets’.\n\nUsers immediately started to love it for quick updates, following famous folks, and talking about trendy stuff online.\n\nTwitter had 330 million users\n\nThere were approximately 500 million tweets sent every day\n\nThe average Twitter user spent around 3.39 minutes per session on the platform\n\n80% of Twitter’s users access the platform via mobile devices\n\nThe peak user activity time on Twitter is between 12 pm and 3 pm\n\n85% of small and medium businesses leverage Twitter for marketing\n\nBut now, there’s something new – X Corp.\n\nSo, what do you think – can we still tweet like before, even though it’s called X now?\n\nLet’s dig in.\n\nWhat Is X Corp\n\nX-Corporation (X-Corp) is a brand-new tech company set up by Elon Musk in July 2023.\n\nIt’s part of X Holdings Corp., also owned by Musk.\n\nX Corp Company Overview\n\nYear founded: 9 March 2023\n\nHeadquarters: San Francisco, California, United States\n\nOwner: Elon Musk\n\nIndustry: Social media\n\nMusk sees X-Corp as more than just social media – he wants it to be an “everything app”.\n\nSo, besides tweeting and socializing, you’ll have loads of different services all in one place.\n\nNow, let us ask you:\n\nLoading ...\n\nA Closer Look Into X Corp’s Vision\n\nAs we said before, X Corp is taking things to another level.\n\n(It will be much more than just tweeting).\n\nYou will be able to talk to friends, live stream, pay for stuff, get a ride or even order food.\n\nKinda feels like China’s WeChat, doesn’t it?\n\nFrom dating and shopping to streaming shows, food delivery, or banking, X Corp aims to be your go-to for everything.\n\nEmbracing Change: Twitter’s Evolution into X\n\nIndeed, the winds of change are already blowing!\n\nThe iconic Twitter bird is gone, replaced by a stylish ‘X’ logo.\n\nThe classic http://twitter.com domain?\n\nIt now redirects you directly to http://x.com.\n\nNow, you can write much longer posts – up to 4,000 characters, instead of the old 280.\n\nWill Twitter users who are now X users embrace this change?\n\nLet’s explore.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Current Twitter Users\n\nFor sure, the shift from Twitter to X raises some applicable questions for ‘old’ Twitter users.\n\nAbout 48% of Twitter users indicated that they use the platform to read news.\n\nA similar number relied on Twitter for fun, relaxation, and entertainment.\n\nNow, here’s a question…\n\nWill people start using X for more than just news and entertainment?\n\nCould X’s additional solutions outshine its original, news-centric appeal?\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe Impact Of X Corp On Twitter’s User Statistics\n\nBefore X Corp came along, Twitter had around 200 million users every month all over the world.\n\nMost Twitter users were from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, and more and more people were starting to use it in India.\n\nBut when X Corp showed up, things really took off.\n\nIn just the first 12 hours, the number of users shot up to 400 million.\n\nThat’s double the number of users in half a day!\n\nClearly, X Corp is onto something big. 😉\n\nSource: Statista\n\nUser Demographics\n\nAs X Corp rolls out more features and services, the types of people using the platform are likely to change and diversify.\n\nTwitter Users By Gender\n\nThese were Twitter users sorted by gender:\n\nTwitter had a diverse user base with a gender distribution of 63% male and 27% female, and its highest user activity time was between 12 pm and 3 pm.\n\nBy comparison, Instagram has 51.68 % male users and 48.2 % female users.\n\nMeanwhile, Snapchat is used by 51% of females and 48.2% of males.\n\nSource: Statista\n\nTwitter Users By Age\n\nTwitter has maintained a unique platform that attracts certain age groups.\n\n59.2% of Twitter users are between the ages of 25 and 49, called Adult Twitter Users.\n\nNumber Of Twitter Users by Country\n\nWhich countries have the most Twitter users in 2023?\n\nThe United States leads the world in number of Twitter users, boasting a user base of 64.9 million.\n\nNorth America is the region with the highest number of Twitter users among all regions.\n\nSource: Statista\n\nThe Most-followed Accounts\n\nWhat were the most popular Twitter accounts?\n\nElon Musk’s profile currently ranks #1 with 146.6 million followers.\n\nBelow are the top 10 most-followed Twitter accounts in 2023:\n\nThese are the top gainers in the number of followers in the last 30 days on X:\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nMost Popular Emojis\n\nUsers on social media often express themselves using emojis.\n\n“Face with Tears of Joy” emoji has taken the top spot as the favored emoji among Twitter users in 2023.\n\nHere are the other most popular emojis that people frequently use on Twitter.\n\n😂 – Face with Tears of Joy\n\n😭 – Loudly Crying Face\n\n✨ – Sparkles\n\n🤣 – Rolling on the Floor Laughing\n\n🥺 – Pleading Face\n\n❤️ – Red Heart\n\n🙏 – Folded Hands\n\n🥰 – Smiling Face with Hearts\n\n😊 – Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes\n\nIt will be truly interesting to see if and how emoji usage evolves on X Corp.\n\nSource: Emojipedia\n\nTwitter Value\n\nHow much is Twitter worth?\n\nWhen Twitter started in 2006, it was worth “only” 220,000 USD.\n\nHowever, in just a few years, its value grew a lot, reaching 9.25 billion USD by 2011.\n\nTwitter’s market cap was 41.09 billion USD in July 2023.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nTwitter Annual Revenue\n\nIs Twitter making money?\n\nWell, not anymore.\n\nHowever, most of Twitter’s revenue came from advertising and data licensing.\n\nTwitter made revenue of over 4.4 billion USD by the end of 2022.\n\nWe show Twitter annual revenue from 2012 to 2022.\n\nThe future earnings of X Corp could see significant changes.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nWhat’s Next For X Corp\n\nThe transformation of Twitter Inc into X Corp company marks a significant shift in the social media landscape.\n\nMusk’s vision for X Corp as a “super app” could potentially change the way users interact with social media platforms.\n\nAs X Corp continues to develop, it will be interesting to monitor its growth and the impact of its expanded functionalities on user demographics and user engagement.\n\nBlog posts you
