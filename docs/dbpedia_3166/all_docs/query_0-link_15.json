(NYSE: VVV), the quick, easy, trusted leader in preventive automotive maintenance, today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended June 30, 2024. All comparisons in this press release are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise noted.\n\n\"We delivered 12% growth in sales in the third quarter driven by system-wide same-store sales growth of 6.5%,\" said Lori Flees, President & CEO. \"We are pleased with the continued momentum in non-oil change revenue service penetration which was the largest driver of same-store sales growth this quarter.\"\n\nFlees continued, \"This quarter we added 33 new stores, 15 of which came from our franchise partners. This brings our year-to-date net additions to 109 stores, resulting in a system-wide store count of 1,961.

The webcast and supporting materials will be accessible through Valvoline's website at http://investors.valvoline.com. Following the live event, an archived version of the webcast and supporting materials will be available.\n\nKey Business Measures\n\nValvoline tracks its operating performance and manages its business using certain key measures, including system-wide, company-operated and franchised store counts and SSS; and system-wide store sales. Management believes these measures are useful to evaluating and understanding Valvoline's operating performance and should be considered as supplements to, not substitutes for, Valvoline's net revenues and operating income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nNet revenues are influenced by the number of service center stores and the business performance of those stores. Stores are considered open upon acquisition or opening for business. Temporary store closings remain in the respective store counts with only permanent store closures reflected in the activity and end of period store counts. SSS is defined as net revenues by U.S. Valvoline Instant Oil Change (\"VIOC\") stores (company-operated, franchised and the combination of these for system-wide SSS), with new stores, including franchised conversions, excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation as this period is generally required for new store sales levels to begin to normalize.\n\nNet revenues are limited to sales at company-operated stores, in addition to royalties and other fees from independent franchised and Express Care stores. Although Valvoline does not recognize store-level sales from franchised stores as net revenues in its Statements of Condensed Consolidated Income, management believes system-wide and franchised SSS comparisons, store counts, and total system-wide store sales are useful to assess market position relative to competitors and overall store and operating performance.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nThe following non-GAAP measures are included herein: Adjusted net revenues; EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow. Refer to the tables herein for management's definition of each non-GAAP measure and reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n\nNon-GAAP measures include adjustments from results based on U.S. GAAP that management believes enables comparison of certain financial trends and results between periods and provides a useful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance that allows for transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating the business and measuring performance. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. The manner used to compute the non-GAAP information used by management may differ from the methods used by other companies and may not be comparable.\n\nRefer to the Appendix at the end of this release for descriptions of the adjustments that depart from the computations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nAbout Valvoline Inc.\n\nValvoline Inc.

Russell\n\n+1 (859) 357-3155\n\n[email protected]\n\nMedia Inquiries\n\nAngela Davied\n\n[email protected]\n\nValvoline Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries\n\nAppendix - Description of Non-GAAP Measures and Adjustments\n\nEBITDA Measures\n\nManagement believes EBITDA measures provide a meaningful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance between periods on a comparable basis due to the depreciable assets associated with the nature of the Company's operations, as well as income tax and interest costs related to Valvoline's tax and capital structures, respectively.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Discretionary Free Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow as additional non-GAAP metrics of cash flow generation. By including capital expenditures and certain other adjustments, as applicable, management is able to provide an indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a supplemental view of cash generation. Discretionary free cash flow includes maintenance capital expenditures, which are routine uses of cash that are necessary to maintain the Company's operations and provides a supplemental view of cash flow generation to maintain operations before discretionary investments in growth. Free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow have certain limitations, including that they do not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments.\n\nAdjusted Net Revenue and Profitability Measures\n\nAdjusted net revenue and profitability measures (i.e., adjusted net income, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA) enable the comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may not be reflective of the Company's underlying and ongoing operational performance or vary independent of business performance.\n\nKey Items\n\nThe non-GAAP measures used by management exclude the impact of certain unusual, infrequent or non-operational activity not directly attributable to the underlying business, which management believes impacts the comparability of operational results between periods (\"key items\"). Key items are often related to legacy matters or market-driven events considered by management to not be reflective of the ongoing operating performance. Key items may consist of adjustments related to: legacy businesses, including the separation from Valvoline's former parent company, the former Global Products reportable segment, and associated impacts of related activity and indemnities; non-service pension and other postretirement plan activity; restructuring-related matters, including organizational restructuring plans, the separation of Valvoline's businesses, significant acquisitions or divestitures, debt extinguishment and modification, and tax reform legislation; in addition to other matters that management considers non-operational, infrequent or unusual in nature.\n\nRefer to the below for descriptions of the key items that comprise the adjustments which depart from the computations in accordance with U.S. GAAP:\n\nNet pension and other postretirement plan expenses: Includes several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by the debt and equity markets, including remeasurement gains and losses, when applicable; and recurring non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic activity, which consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits. Management considers these elements are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global markets (in particular, interest rates), outside the operational performance of the business, and are also legacy amounts that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees for current service.\n\nNet legacy and separation-related expenses: Activity associated with legacy businesses, including the separation from Valvoline's former parent company and its former Global Products reportable segment. This activity includes the recognition of and adjustments to indemnity obligations to its former parent company; certain legal, financial, professional advisory and consulting fees; and other expenses incurred by the continuing operations in connection with and directly related to these separation transactions and legacy matters. This incremental activity directly attributable to legacy matters and separation transactions is not considered reflective of the underlying operating performance of the Company's continuing operations.\n\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized $24.4 million of pre-tax expense to reflect its increased estimated indemnity obligation which also resulted in an income tax benefit of $26.5 million to reflect the release of valuations allowances in connection with the amended tax matters agreement with Valvoline's former parent company.\n\nInformation technology transition costs: Consists of expenses incurred related to the Company's transition to a stand-alone enterprise resource planning software system during fiscal years 2023 and 2024, including data conversion, temporary support, training, and redundant expenses incurred from duplicative technology platforms. These expenses are reflective of incremental costs directly associated with technology transitions and data migration that are not considered to be reflective of the ongoing expenses of operating the Company's technology platforms.\n\nSuspended operations: Represents the results of a former Global Products business where operations were suspended during fiscal 2022. This business was not included in the sale of the Global Products business in March 2023. It was classified as held for sale and impaired as of September 30, 2023, and subsequently sold during the first fiscal quarter of 2024. These results are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's ongoing continuing operations.\n\nInvestment and divestiture-related costs: Consists of legal, advisory and consulting fees, including diligence costs, associated with significant acquisitions, investments and divestitures, in addition to expense recognized to reduce the carrying value of an investment interest determined to be impaired. These costs are not considered to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing continuing operations.\n\nDebt extinguishment and modification costs: Consists of accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs as well as third-party fees expensed in connection with the execution of the 2030 Notes redemption during the three months ended June 30, 2024 as well as the amended Senior Credit Agreement during fiscal 2023. These expenses are not considered to be indicative of the future servicing costs of the Company's ongoing debt facilities.\n\nSOURCE Valvoline Inc."
