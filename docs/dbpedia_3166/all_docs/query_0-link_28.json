        "text": "Just the Facts\n\nTwitter and two former senior executives have struck a $809.5 million settlement to resolve allegations that the company misrepresented its monthly active user growth throughout 2015. This settlement represents 24% - 30% of estimated recoverable damages, which is up to nine times the median recovery, on a percentage basis, when compared to similarly sized settlements. The $809.5 million settlement is also one of the largest securities class action settlements of all time, but interestingly, isn’t the largest settlement in 2022. That accolade belongs to the €1.4 billion global Steinhoff International settlement.\n\nCase Name In re Twitter, Inc. Securities Litigation\n\n(4:16-cv-05314) Class Period February 6, 2015 - July 28, 2015 Settlement Amount $809,500,000 Security Twitter common stock (TWTR; 90184L102; US90184L1026; BFLR866) Court United States District Court for the\n\nNorthern District of California Class Counsel Motley Rice LLC and\n\nRobbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Class Representatives KBC Asset Management NV and\n\nNational Elevator Industry Pension Fund Initial Complaint Filed September 16, 2016 Preliminary Approval August 5, 2022 Final Approval Hearing November 17, 2022 Claim Filing Deadline November 23, 2022\n\nTwitter, Inc. is a communications company based in San Francisco, California. In 2006, the company launched their primary product Twitter, a social networking platform that allows users to consume, create, distribute, and discover content. To generate revenue, Twitter sells ad space to global advertisers that aim to reach a large and growing user base. Thus, the company and analysts have focused closely on metrics measuring total users and, equally as important, the level of engagement of such users.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that, in 2015, Twitter made misrepresentations and omissions about the company’s prospects for increasing user growth and engagement including that Twitter knowingly made inaccurate public statements regarding these metrics and failed to disclose that the company’s actual user growth was much slower. As a result, Twitter’s stock dropped to under $26 per share, down from $50 per share in early 2015.\n\nInvestors who purchased or acquired Twitter, Inc. common stock between February 6, 2015 and July 28, 2015 have until November 23, 2022 to file their claim.\n\nRECOGNIZED LOSS AMOUNTS INVOLVED A “DOWN TO THE MINUTE” CALCULATION\n\nIn order to potentially have a recognized loss under the court-approved Plan of Allocation, class members that purchased Twitter common stock prior to the first corrective disclosure, which occurred on April 28, 2015, must have held those shares until at least 3:07 p.m. EDT on April 28, 2015. If the class member sold their shares prior to 3:07 p.m. then their recognized loss would be $0.00.\n\nIMPACT: Complicated recognized loss calculations increase the amount of time and expertise necessary to accurately calculate each claimant’s recognized loss amount, especially when bespoke processes may be required to identify eligible transactions properly and completely to maximize recovery. This challenge leads to a more complicated and involved review and quality assurance process to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the Administrator’s findings and to ensure an accurate recovery."
