        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021.\n\n\"Our strong 2021 performance positions us to improve execution and deliver on our 2023 goals,\" said Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO. \"We are more focused and better organized to deliver improved personalization and selection for our audience, partners, and advertisers.\"\n\n\"Twitter had a solid fourth quarter to finish 2021, with over $5 billion in annual revenue, up 37% for the year,\" said Ned Segal, Twitter's CFO. \"There are no changes to our goals of 315 million average mDAU in Q4 2023 and $7.5 billion or more revenue in 2023. Our increased focus on performance ads and the SMB opportunity after the sale of MoPub positions us even better for 2022 and beyond.\"\n\nFiscal Year 2021 Operational and Financial Highlights\n\nExcept as otherwise stated, all financial results discussed below are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. As supplemental information, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release's supplemental tables, and such supplemental tables include a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results. The sum of individual metrics may not always equal total amounts indicated due to rounding.\n\n2021 revenue was $5.08 billion, an increase of 37% year over year.\n\n2021 operating loss of $493 million, or an operating margin of -10%, includes a one-time litigation-related net charge of $766 million1, as well as ongoing investments.\n\n2021 adjusted operating income, which excludes the one-time litigation-related net charge, was $273 million reflecting an adjusted operating margin of 5%. Operating income was $27 million in 2020, which includes a $150 million non-recurring expense related to an ongoing FTC matter in Q2 of 2020, representing an operating margin of 1%.\n\n2021 net loss was $221 million, representing a net margin of -4% and diluted EPS of ($0.28).\n\n2020 net loss of $1.14 billion includes a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $1.10 billion and corresponding non-cash income tax expense based primarily on cumulative taxable losses driven primarily by COVID-19, representing a net margin of -31% and diluted EPS of ($1.44).\n\nFourth Quarter 2021 Operational and Financial Highlights\n\nQ4 revenue totaled $1.57 billion, an increase of 22% year over year or 23% on a constant currency basis.\n\nAdvertising revenue totaled $1.41 billion, up 22% year over year or 24% on a constant currency basis.\n\nTotal ad engagements decreased 12% year over year.\n\nCost per engagement (CPE) increased 39% year over year.\n\nData licensing and other revenue totaled $154 million, an increase of 15% year over year.\n\nUS revenue totaled $885 million, an increase of 21% year over year.\n\nInternational revenue totaled $683 million, an increase of 23% year over year or 26% on a constant currency basis.\n\nQ4 costs and expenses totaled $1.40 billion, an increase of 35% year over year. This resulted in operating income of $167 million and 11% operating margin, compared to operating income of $252 million and 20% operating margin in the same period of the previous year.\n\nStock-based compensation (SBC) expense grew 38% year over year to $177 million and was approximately 11% of total revenue.\n\nQ4 net income was $182 million, representing a net margin of 12% and diluted EPS of $0.21. This compares to net income of $222 million, a net margin of 17%, and diluted EPS of $0.27 in the same period of the previous year.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities in the quarter was $528 million due primarily to the cash payment of a litigation settlement announced in Q3, compared to $330 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the same period last year. Capital expenditures totaled $138 million, compared to $292 million in the same period last year, reflecting our latest data center buildouts, as well as delays in equipment delivery in Q4'21 due to supply chain disruptions.\n\nAverage mDAU was 217 million for Q4, compared to 192 million in the same period of the previous year and compared to 211 million in the previous quarter.\n\nAverage US mDAU was 38 million for Q4, compared to 37 million in the same period of the previous year and compared to 37 million in the previous quarter.\n\nAverage international mDAU was 179 million for Q4, compared to 155 million in the same period of the previous year and compared to 174 million in the previous quarter.\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program. The program is effective immediately and replaces the previously approved $2 billion program from 2020, of which approximately $819 million remained. As part of the new program, we intend to enter into a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) and repurchase the remaining $2 billion over time. We will continuously evaluate efficient alternatives to using cash on hand to fund the program, including accessing the capital markets, subject to market conditions.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor Q1'22, we expect:\n\nTotal revenue to be between $1.17 billion and $1.27 billion.\n\nGAAP operating loss to be between $225 million and $175 million.\n\nFor FY22, we expect:\n\nStock-based compensation expense to be between $900 million and $925 million.\n\nCapital expenditures to be between $900 million and $950 million.\n\nNote that our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2022 reflects foreign exchange rates as of January 2022.\n\nFor more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below.\n\nAppendix\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Webcast and Conference Call Details\n\nTwitter will host a conference call today, Thursday, February 10, 2022, at 5am Pacific Time (8am Eastern Time) to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2021. The company will be following the conversation about the earnings announcement on Twitter. To have your questions considered during the Q&A, Tweet your question to @TwitterIR using $TWTR. To listen to a live audio webcast, please visit the company's Investor Relations page at investor.twitterinc.com. Twitter has used, and intends to continue to use, its Investor Relations website and the Twitter accounts of @paraga, @nedsegal, @Twitter, and @TwitterIR as means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nFirst Quarter Earnings Release Details\n\nTwitter expects to release financial results for the first quarter on April 28, 2022, before the market opens. Twitter will host a conference call on the same day to discuss these financial results at 5am Pacific Time (8am Eastern Time).\n\nAbout Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR)\n\nTwitter (NYSE: TWTR) is what's happening and what people are talking about right now. To learn more, visit about.twitter.com and follow @Twitter. Let's talk.\n\nA Note About Metrics\n\nTwitter defines monetizable daily active usage or users (mDAU) as people, organizations, or other accounts who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day through twitter.com, Twitter applications that are able to show ads, or paid Twitter products, including subscriptions. We updated our mDAU definition in the fourth quarter of 2021 to also include \"paid Twitter products, including subscriptions\", so this key metric continues to accurately reflect our audience as our products evolve. This change had no material impact on the number of mDAU reported in the fourth quarter of 2021, and is unlikely to do so in the near future. This change is effective for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for future periods, and it did not affect prior periods. Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology.\n\nThe numbers of mDAU presented in our earnings materials are based on internal company data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement across our large number of total accounts around the world. Furthermore, our metrics may be impacted by our information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. For example, there are a number of false or spam accounts in existence on our platform. We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate that the average of false or spam accounts during the fourth quarter of 2021 represented fewer than 5% of our mDAU during the quarter. The false or spam accounts for a period represents the average of false or spam accounts in the samples during each monthly analysis period during the quarter. In making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to estimate the total number of spam accounts and eliminate them from the calculation of our mDAU, and have made improvements in our spam detection capabilities that have resulted in the suspension of a large number of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. We intend to continue to make such improvements. After we determine an account is spam, malicious automation, or fake, we stop counting it in our mDAU, or other related metrics. We also treat multiple accounts held by a single person or organization as multiple mDAU because we permit people and organizations to have more than one account. Additionally, some accounts used by organizations are used by many people within the organization. As such, the calculations of our mDAU may not accurately reflect the actual number of people or organizations using our platform.\n\nIn addition, geographic location data collected for purposes of reporting the geographic location of our mDAU is based on the IP address or phone number associated with the account when an account is initially registered on Twitter. The IP address or phone number may not always accurately reflect a person's actual location at the time they engaged with our platform. For example, someone accessing Twitter from the location of the proxy server that the person connects to rather than from the person's actual location.\n\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Twitter's future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"going to,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"positions,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue,\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Twitter's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Twitter's future financial and operating performance, including its outlook, guidance and 2023 revenue and mDAU goals, as well as the factors, assumptions and variables underlying Twitter's outlook, guidance and goals; Twitter's focus on performance ads and the SMB opportunity;Twitter's expectations regarding future capital expenditures and other expenses, including its SBC expense; and Twitter's expectations regarding share repurchases, including the timing and amount of repurchases, its intentions regarding an accelerated share repurchase, and its strategies to fund the repurchase program. Twitter's expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include the possibility that: the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results and the achievement of our strategic objectives as well as the markets in which we operate and worldwide and regional economies; Twitter's total accounts and engagement do not grow or decline; Twitter's strategies, priorities, or plans take longer to execute than anticipated; Twitter's new products and product features do not meet expectations and fail to drive mDAU growth; advertisers continue to reduce or discontinue their spending on Twitter; data partners reduce or discontinue their purchases of data licenses from Twitter; and Twitter experiences expenses that exceed its expectations. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Twitter's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, each filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional information will also be set forth in Twitter's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Twitter as of the date hereof, and Twitter disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement Twitter's financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, Twitter considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including revenues excluding foreign exchange effect, which we refer to as on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP costs and expenses, and adjusted free cash flow. In order to present revenues on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year and quarter ended December 31, 2021, Twitter translated the applicable measure using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for its settlement currencies other than the US dollar. Twitter defines non-GAAP income before income taxes as income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, non-cash expense related to acquisitions, impairment (gain) on investments in privately held companies, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain, if any; Twitter defines non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes as the current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability using the estimated annual effective tax rate, which is dependent on the jurisdictional mix of earnings; and Twitter defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, non-cash expense related to acquisitions, impairment (gain) on investments in privately held companies, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain, if any, and adjustment to income tax expense based on the non-GAAP measure of profitability using the estimated annual effective tax rate, which is dependent on the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by non-GAAP diluted share count. Non-GAAP diluted share count is GAAP basic share count plus potential common stock instruments such as stock options, RSUs, shares to be purchased under employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock, the conversion feature of convertible senior notes, and warrants. Twitter defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest and other expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain, if any. Twitter defines non-GAAP costs and expenses as total costs and expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash expense related to acquisitions, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain, if any. We have presented adjusted income from operations solely to exclude the one time net charge related to litigation in 2021, and no other adjustments were made in the calculation of this measure. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by GAAP revenue. Adjusted free cash flow is GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (i.e., purchases of property and equipment including equipment purchases that were financed through finance leases, less proceeds received from the disposition of property and equipment).\n\nTwitter is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing Twitter's operating results through the eyes of management, and because it believes that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing Twitter's core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in its industry.\n\nTwitter believes that revenues on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP costs and expenses, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted operating margin provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of Twitter's past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by Twitter's management in its financial and operational decision-making. Twitter uses these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and evaluating its performance.\n\nTwitter believes that revenues on a constant currency basis is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to its historical performance. Twitter believes that non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP costs and expenses, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted operating margin help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by expenses and one-time gains or charges.\n\nIn addition, Twitter believes that adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash from operations and that it is typically a more conservative measure of cash flows. However, adjusted free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of its ability to fund its cash needs.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nContacts\n\nInvestors:\n\n[email protected]\n\nPress:\n\n[email protected]\n\nSOURCE Twitter, Inc."
