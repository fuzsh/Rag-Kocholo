        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nTwitter has become increasingly visible on the business end due to its connections with popular social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Myspace. Founded in 2006, Twitter has rapidly gained popularity and is now estimated to have over 200 million users and growing. Twitter is a free micro-blogging service that allows members to post updates 140 characters in length. Twitter is not limited to computer usage, as smartphones and text messages can be used for a more convenient way to post updates to Twitter. Now members can follow their favorite companies, celebrities, and friends to be the first to receive their latest updates. This concept has turned valuable to companies wishing to reach people using Twitter. According to ComScore, about 5 years after its creation, Twitter.com has become the 8th largest web property. With Twitter's great SEO, non-members can still see company tweets upon entering their name into a popular search engine. With Twitter's potential plethora of new customers, this would be a business's chance to venture into the Twitter Advertising market. Advertising can be tricky on a limited space website, but the paid services and real-time marketing potential provided by Twitter is what the marketing business is looking for. In 2010, Twitter generated an estimated $45 million from the promoted trends and tweets, with money now being made in the US, UK, and Japan. The promoted tweets and trends are types of paid advertising that allow companies to get their message at the top of the Twitter timeline or in the trends box where it will not be missed by targeted trend viewers. This method increases the cost of the ad to the company with each retweet, reply, or favorite. With its quick and effective way to get potential customers involved, promoted trends and tweets are a simple way to ensure more business for your company. The real battle between Twitter and its advertisers is always done in the Ad auctions. The auction allows advertisers to place bids on how much they are willing to pay per engagement on promoted tweets. Since promoted tweets have shown to garner 1-3% engagement rates, these companies can at most only spend a small fraction of their earnings generated from their new customers. Twitter has recently announced its new feature, automatic bids, which is a preferred method for small advertisers to get a foot in the door with no analysis of the auction market. This announcement has got some larger advertisers concerned, so it is still unclear what effect it will have on the competition between larger and smaller advertisers. Any type of ad campaign can be ended with the promoted account, which requires the same auction strategy to get \"suggested for users to follow\" at the top of similar search query and competitor account results. Promoted trends and tweets have now become a simple and useful way of marketing for advertisers, but Twitter plans on taking it a step further by providing them more tools and analytics information. This upcoming quarter, Twitter will release a new ad dashboard, which is said to improve the promoted product experience. With its increase of activity in advertising, Twitter plans to reach the estimated 14% share of global mobile internet ad revenues in 2012. This will mean more money is put into the mobile platform ads and will be split with 70% for the advertising company and 30% for Twitter. With these numbers prompted to increase annually, advertisers can only expect more from Twitter in terms of advertising, customer engagement, and potential revenues.\n\n2. Twitter's Business Model\n\nTwitter is free to its users, but it needs revenue. As it has not charged for its services, it has looked to develop new ways of earning money to recover the costs of offering a robust service, particularly as it has utilized more and more bandwidth as its use has grown. Twitter's first real attempt at a revenue stream was through placing of 3rd party adverts in the form of various \"Twitter Directories\". These directories list Twitter users, group them by categories, and allow the user to search for users of a particular interest. Some of these directories allow users to add themselves, some only include the top users on Twitter. Since then, Twitter has ruled that third-party advertising services are no longer allowed, and these services are no longer a viable revenue stream for Twitter. These have been discontinued and could be seen as a failed business model, with Twitter phasing these out as it had developed a more suitable replacement. Twitter's second advertising platform has been through the placing of its own targeted adverts: \"Promoted Accounts\", \"Promoted Trends\", and \"Promoted Tweets\" at the top of Twitter search results and also on users' Twitter pages. Twitter has a large body of data on the interests of each user by analyzing what the user tweets about and who the user follows. Using this data, Twitter is able to effectively target users that would be interested in certain products, events, or organizations. The effectiveness of this advertising platform is quite high, with the adverts not seeming out of place and relevant to the user. This platform has been significantly more successful than third-party adverts and has been a viable revenue stream for Twitter.\n\n2.1. Advertising on Twitter\n\nTwitter began to generate advertising revenues in April 2010 by using 'Promoted Tweets'. This is a service in which advertised tweets appear at the top of search results and also in the timelines of those that Twitter deems as being interested in that particular tweet. This is decided through an algorithm which is based on the information that the user has provided to Twitter. The option to solely advertise at the top of search results was removed to encourage the use of advertising within timelines. In 2011, Twitter then allowed companies to use 'Promoted Trends'. This means that companies can promote a specific trend (topic) onto the Twitter trending topics list. This allows the millions of Twitter users to see that topic. 'Promoted Trends' remains in demand as it has continued to become more expensive, but companies do believe it is an effective way of advertising. Twitter refers to the way they advertise as 'a way of connecting with publishers, be it with Promoted Tweets, Promoted Accounts, or Promoted Trends'. It continues to further this with its advertising-based acquisition of Niche in 2015, which is a talent agency for social media influencers. This purchase, in effect, allows Twitter to gather more data and provide better targets for advertisers. Twitter also has a self-service ad platform that allows any user to load up funds in a campaign and set a budget and bid to advertise themselves. The advertiser is then charged based on the interactions with the ad, and they are given detailed information on how their campaign performed. In the first quarter of 2016, advertising brought in $531 million in revenue, an 18% increase year-on-year. This is a key source of revenue for Twitter, and it offers promise for the future of the company.\n\nBy selecting \"Promoted Tweets\" during step 2 of the Campaign Builder, advertisers can run Promoted-only Tweet campaigns! A Tweet that an advertiser has paid for to be shown to people who are not already following the advertiser's Twitter account. Promoted Tweets are clearly labeled as Promoted when an advertiser is paying Twitter to run the Tweet in search results or in the user's Twitter stream and may also be displayed as ordinary Tweets in timelines or search results. In every case, Promoted Tweets will act just like regular Tweets and can be retweeted, replied to, liked, etc. Any Promoted Tweet that people engage with at a high rate will also be labeled as \"high-quality\" and will be expanded in a user's search results. When a user's search query matches an advertiser's keyword targeted, the Promoted Tweet ad will be shown at the top of the search results page!\n\n3. Advertising Revenues on Twitter\n\nAs proposed by Edwards, Twitter started testing and understanding the effectiveness of different business models that could be utilized by Twitter in October 2010, whereby Promoted Trends was introduced. When a user clicked onto a Promoted Trend, the search results and the trend itself would be labeled as 'promoted' for the relevant advertiser. Tapping into mobile advertising, Twitter also delivered Promoted Tweets into users' mobile devices in the commencement of 2011. Also in the same year, a self-service ad platform was built. Twitter has formed various advertising partnerships with big names such as Starcom Mediavest Group (SMG) and WPP that allowed them to purchase advertising on Twitter, hence generating revenue for Twitter. These ad purchases would be multi-million dollar purchases. Computational advertising is an interdisciplinary field which is defined as the study and the use of data-driven methods to make decisions on quantitative marketing goals. This compliments Twitter as advertisers can engage in real-time bidding for available ads inventory based on information of its users and could target and segment ads on Twitter, thus increasing the value of the ads. This builds onto Promoted Tweets and Trends in a sense that the motivated advertiser can pay for the ad to stay at the top of the search results and also raise awareness and increase the conversation around the product. In the long run, there is potential for behavioral targeting based on analysis of user behavior. Twitter has seen revenue growth of US$28 million in 2010 and is expecting to see revenues of US$400 million for the year 2013. This increasing revenue flow is evidence of success for their revenue generation strategies and has paved the way for a future of increasing opportunity for advertisement on Twitter.\n\n3.1. Revenue Generation Strategies\n\nThe revenue generation strategies by Twitter mainly revolve around providing 'free' advertising facilities to companies and businesses to create an online presence. Currently, Twitter's primary source of revenue is its 'Promoted Suite' of advertising tools, launched in 2010, which generated 86% of Twitter's 2011 revenue and continues to grow. The concept of promoted products allows businesses to advertise and increase the likelihood of the product or service being discovered by users, providing an opportunity to increase the volume of new and repeat business. This is done by promoting specific products to a particular geography, device, and interest, and appearing in a user's timeline. Using a promoted product will mean an increase in cost. When a user takes an action that is in line with the advertising goal, they are charged, which is known as engagement pricing. Another form of promoted advertising is the use of promoted accounts and promoted trends. The former is when a Twitter account pays to increase its number of followers by being suggested to users and appearing on their home page. This is a low-risk and low-cost method of advertising but can contribute to long-term value. For small to medium-sized businesses, Twitter offers a small business advertising set up. The definition of a small to medium-sized business is based on the country in which the business is based and its spend. This service is aimed at businesses who do not have the time or resources to manage an advertising campaign, who prefer a fully automated system to doing it themselves, and are new to advertising on Twitter. The aspect of fully automated is simply to provide a hands-free set up in which an advert is created from a collection of tweets. Then, the best-performing tweets will be selected and displayed as adverts. This is done with the use of automatic and optimized bidding, using the best price bid to help the business achieve the best results. Newer businesses who successfully spend a small amount over a month period will also receive automatic campaign optimization to improve performance and results.\n\n3.2. Advertising Partnerships\n\nTwitter has established a number of advertising partnerships across the globe. Twitter's advertising partnership with Airtel (Bharti Telecom Ltd) saw the launch of Twitter's first official promoted account and promoted tweets in India. Twitter also partnered with Vodafone to create sponsored content in the United Kingdom. In October 2012, Twitter and Starcom MediaVest Group, a division of Publicis Groupe and one of the world's largest media agencies, announced a strategic mobile advertising partnership. SMG will work with Twitter to promote and scale the agency's mobile and real-time marketing strategies around the world. The deal is worth about $50 million and will include criteria that are linked to increasing the levels of participation and performance of Twitter advertising. This means that Twitter will benefit SMG in improving their mobile ad strategy and, in turn, Twitter's mobile strategy will benefit. This is an example of a performance-based advertising deal. A performance-based advertising deal is where advertisers pay for tweets or trends based on meeting pre-determined campaign objectives. This contrasts with traditional CPM or impression-based advertising where advertisers buy space. Twitter also has plans to roll out measurement tools that are aimed at better demonstrating advertising ROI using offline sales data comparisons in collaboration with Dataloglix. These tools will enable advertisers to comprehend the sales impact of a promoted tweet campaign and provide insights about the specific effects on sales. Ryan Bonnici, who is the head of content and brand marketing at HubSpot, cited that Dataloglix' new measurement tools are a significant development in demonstrating how Twitter ads affect sales, as previously there has been no clarity on what impact Twitter advertising has on sales. This suggests that Twitter's advertising revenue strategies will be more about demonstrating ROI to advertisers as opposed to the current strategy of selling adverts with the aim of increasing brand exposure in order to attract new consumers and improve brand loyalty.\n\n3.3. Revenue Growth\n\nIn 2012's Q4 earnings, Twitter reported that its advertising revenue was $1.6 million. In the following quarter, Twitter's ad revenue was a reported $7 million. As Twitter continues to increase the scope and relevance of its ad products, it is likely that growth in ad revenue should increase. According to recent projections, advertising revenue is estimated to increase to $150 million in 2011. Furthermore, a study from eMarketer is predicting that Twitter's ad revenue will be in the ballpark of $250 million in 2012. These figures are impressive considering that Twitter reported $45 million in total revenue for 2010. With the increasing utilization of ad products and higher effectiveness in ad engagement, it is not outlandish to speculate that advertising revenue could account for half of Twitter's total revenue. It has been suggested that Twitter's advertisement products such as \"Promoted Tweets\" have proven to be more effective than traditional internet display advertisement. According to a survey of more than 5,000 individuals by online advertising company Chitika, 0.33% of Twitter users click on Promoted Tweets while the average percentage of ad clicks for display ad across the web is only 0.1%. Click through rate is 3.10% for search based ads meaning that there is still room for improvement in Twitter's ad engagement. Stepak's, Osborne and Rose say Twitter makes $0.92 per thousand timeline views compared to U.S. average of $2.71 for social networking sites, leaving room for improvement in its ad effectiveness. These statistics show that Twitter has the potential to create more effective advertisement which would in turn increase ad revenue.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nAn emerging firm in the social media industry, Twitter is a business company talking about an online social networking service where we can post and read short 140-character text messages called \"tweets\". The site was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams and launched in July 2006. The company will generate revenue from marketing services. It's clearly seen that Twitter is imitating Google's AdWords. Twitter's business model has significantly changed since its foundation. This is because in earlier years, Twitter continues to develop its platform without creating a revenue service that causes a deficit to be a long-term issue. A study published with Statista on marketing investment going into Twitter from 2013 and forecasts revenue till 2015. In 2013, American marketers have spent nearly 600 million USD on Twitter which is 260 million less than the 2015 forecast. This study shows a substantial amount of money going into advertising on Twitter meaning that the marketing platform is growing and there will be potential profit in the growing market. Twitter's CFO stated \"We have a strong pipeline that includes a variety of ad products that we believe will contribute to increasing ad performance\". There are not many changes from the previous business model on revenue data. Although Twitter is still in deficit, annual revenue has increased by more than double every year. From SNA data in 2013, the annual revenue of 2012 was $317,000,000 with a projected revenue for 2013 at $807,500,000. In addition, the number of employees has also increased in a doubled amount. This is indirect evidence showing the thriving market and future potential. According to CEO of Twitter Dick Costolo, this year will be the investment stage to build a strong infrastructure for Twitter with roughly 300 million to 1 billion users in. This is an over double amount from current users at 127.6 million. In the last stage, targets are set to increase profitability with an approach to develop cost structure and maximize long-term revenue growth. Being still a deficit company, this course has the potential to double or triple revenue in the long term coming."
