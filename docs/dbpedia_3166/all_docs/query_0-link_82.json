Then with the launch of an iPhone app, Facebook acquired the social network after 24 months of the original release date with 30 million monthly active users.\n\nIt took 7.7 years for Instagram since its launch to reach more than 1 billion monthly active users and 11.2 years to hit 2 billion in monthly active users worldwide.\n\nNotable Instagram MAU milestones:\n\nFebruary 2013: Instagram hit 100 million users (MAU)\n\nJune 2016: Instagram hit 500 million users (MAU)\n\nJune 2018: Instagram hit 1 billion users (MAU)\n\nOctober 2022: Instagram hit 2 billion users (MAU)\n\nInstagram User Growth Rate History\n\nAccording to estimates, the company has been adding over 70 million new users every year – This user growth rate has been consistent since 2020.\n\nGlobal Instagram Monthly Active User Growth Rate\n\nBelow is the latest data available via Instagram (Facebook).\n\n2020 to 2021 – 170 million user growth\n\n2021 to 2022 – 70 million user growth\n\n2022 to 2023 – 70 million user growth\n\n2023 to 2024 – 50 million user growth\n\n2024 to 2025 – 40 million user growth\n\nNote: Data is based on estimates and includes forecasts. eMarketer estimates suggest around 1.3 billion monthly active users (below company’s 2 billion monthly active user base) and are lower due to differences in methodology and accounting for spam, fake, business users.\n\nAnother interesting estimate they’ve made is about the US growth of the platform.\n\nUS Instagram Monthly Active User Growth Rate\n\n2020 to 2021 – 4.31% year-over-year change\n\n2021 to 2022 – 3.98% year-over-year change\n\n2022 to 2023 – 4.05% year-over-year change\n\n2023 to 2024 – 3.75% year-over-year change\n\n2024 to 2025 – 3.47% year-over-year change\n\nNote: Data above includes forecasts.\n\nAs the platform has become more accessible to the world with new features like instant translation, Instagram has seen some impressive growth outside of the US.\n\nWhat you have to consider with Instagram’s growth is that there are only 5.6 billion mobile users worldwide, and so far, a whopping 35.71% of them have the app.\n\nInstagram App Penetration Rates\n\nBelow, we see Instagram’s estimated penetration rates in select countries ranked by Instagram ad reach rate vs. population aged 18+.\n\nAnd here is the detailed table:\n\nSources: Statista, DataReportal, eMarketer 1, eMarketer 2\n\nMost Instagram Users by Country\n\nNext up, we look at which country has the most Instagram users.\n\nIn 2023, 90.34% of Instagram’s 1.64 billion users that can be potentially reached with adverts on the platform are outside the US.\n\nThe countries with the most active accounts accessing the photo-sharing app are India with 358.55 million users, followed by the United States with 158.45 million, Brazil (122.9 million), Indonesia (104.8 million), and Turkey (56.7 million).\n\nThis international presence, you see below, makes Instagram especially appealing to both influencers and brands for advertising:\n\nSource: DataReportal\n\nHow Many Americans Use Instagram?\n\nAccording to the latest eMarketer estimates, America is the country with 133.5 million users accessing the photo-sharing app monthly.
