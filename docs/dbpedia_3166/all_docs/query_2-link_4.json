Its founders were Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. This was originally a side project stemming from the podcasting tool Odeo.\n\nIn July 2007, Twitter received a $100,000 Series A funding round led by Union Square Ventures.\n\nDorsey stepped down as CEO in October 2008 and was replaced by Evan Williams.\n\nIn 2010, Twitter reached space, when NASA Astronaut Timothy Creamer sent the first tweet from space. The same year, Williams ceded the CEO position to Dick Costolo. Twitter had about 300 employees in 2010.\n\nIn 2012, Twitter‚Äôs reach grew to 200 million active users. Obama used the platform to announce his victory publicly in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn November 2013, Twitter went public on the New York Stock Exchange. The combined wealth of Williams, Dorsey, and Costolo was about $4 billion.\n\nAfter several years of financial decline and waning popularity, rumors began spreading in 2016 that Twitter was looking to be acquired by Salesforce.\n\n2017 was financially profitable for the company, while Trump was the most popular topic of people‚Äôs tweets that year.\n\n2019-2020, Twitter continued to struggle to grow its business. The platform was also hacked in the first year of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, Musk took over Twitter and immediately fired Parag Agrawal, then incumbent CEO, finance head Ned Segal, and head of legal policy Vijaya Gadde.\n\nOn November 8, 2022, Twitter was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors could claim the cash value of their shares.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Facts about Elon Musk\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nAs of April 2, 2024, Elon Musk is the third richest person on the planet.

That year, the company incurred a net loss of $221 million.\n\nThe first tweet was sent on 21 March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, one of the company‚Äôs founders. It said: ‚Äújust setting up my twttr‚Äù by @jack.\n\nThe hashtag idea was proposed in August 2007 by Chris Messina. He wrote: ‚ÄúHow do you feel about using # for groups?‚Äù Elon Musk now says that he hates hashtags.\n\nTwitter expanded its character limit from 140 to 280 in November 2017.\n\nIn April 2023, Musk fired more than 6,000 Twitter employees, constituting around 80% of its workforce.\n\nThe company made a profit for the first time in its history in the fourth quarter of 2017. It earned a $91 million profit on revenue of $732 million.\n\nIn February 2012, Twitter announced a partnership with the Russian search engine Yandex.\n\nIn October 2012, Twitter bought Vine. In January 2013, the company released it as a separate app. The app closed down in October 2016.\n\nIn November 2013, Twitter went public with shares valued at $26 at the opening. Their price nearly doubled ‚Äì $44- by the closing that day.\n\nThe most popular brand account on Twitter is YouTube.\n\nTwitter is the 9th most visited website worldwide.\n\nIt is the world‚Äôs 7th favorite social media platform.\n\nIn 2023, Twitter‚Äôs user count is expected to grow to 329 million.\n\n76.9 million Americans have a Twitter account.\n\nThe average user spends 5.1 hours a month on Twitter.\n\nOver 16% of internet users aged 16-64 use Twitter for brand research.\n\nPeople spent 6 minutes per day on Twitter in 2023.\n\nTwitter‚Äôs CPM is the lowest out of all major platforms.\n\nAd revenue on Twitter is more than $1.41 billion.\n\nTwitter is more popular with millennials than Gen-Z.\n\nThere are over 500 million tweets sent per day.\n\nThe most talked about athletes on Twitter are LeBron James and Simone Biles.\n\nAn average user has over 700 followers.\n\nThere are 391 million Twitter accounts with zero followers.\n\nBrands send on average 0.86 tweets per day, for which they see a median engagement of 0.048%.\n\nTwitter used to be a public company before Musk purchased it. On November 8, 2022, it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMore than 5000 employees are working in 2023 at Twitter. Rumors have it that 2000 more will be hired in 2023.\n\nTwitter‚Äôs engineering team is the largest in the company.\n\nTwitter is frequently sued by its employees. In August 2023, Twitter was sued by seven former employees who allege they were discriminated against based on sex, age, race, and/or for taking medical leave. Following 2022‚Äôs layoffs, former employees claim that Twitter failed to pay promised severance, failed to follow layoff notification requirements, discriminated against them based on age, sex, and disability, and failed to pay vendors and employee bonuses.\n\nTwitter‚Äôs competitors and similar companies include YouTube, Meta, Instagram, Google, Snap, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and WeChat.\n\nTwitter is available in almost all countries except China, North Korea, and Iran, where it is blocked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanges in Twitter since April 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nBack in April 2022, Musk said all the right words about the crucial role Twitter would play for civilization, but then he began to temporize, attempting to put the deal on hold because of spambots. Nevertheless, $44 billion was eventually paid for Twitter in October 2022, after which the platform began experiencing various changes that continue taking place until now.\n\nHow has Musk Changed Twitter?\n\nThe most inconvenient of these changes is Twitter‚Äôs recent change of name. On July 22, 2023, Twitter was re-baptized into X, and the iconic bird logo was replaced with ‚ÄúX.‚Äù But as Musk warned that this was only a temporary logo, more changes in the company‚Äôs branding are possibly in the cards. The app also altered its official handle to @x as part of the rebranding. The original @Twitter handle is now deactivated and redirects users to @x for updates. Meanwhile, Musk is planning to auction off the old Twitter building signs and other relics of the company‚Äôs past. Large bird cages, oil paintings, desks, chairs, and a DJ booth are among the 584 lots presented at the auction. People who like these items for sentimental reasons will be able to purchase them at the beginning of September 2023.\n\nChanges in the company‚Äôs name followed changes in its upper management. In May, Musk stepped down from his position as Twitter (X) CEO, ceding this place to Linda Yaccarino, who had left her role as chairman of Global Advertising & Partnerships at NBCU to help out Musk.\n\nAfter passing the CEO baton to Yaccarino, Musk became the company‚Äôs executive chair and CTO.\n\nOther changes made in 2023 abound.\n\nIn July 2023, Apple began to accept the rebranding of Twitter‚Äôs app to X in the App Store. Although Apple does not let developers name their apps as a single character, it made an exception for Elon Musk. X also changed its App Store tagline from ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk‚Äù to ‚ÄúBlaze Your Glory!‚Äù\n\nAt the same time, in July, X opened up its ad revenue-sharing program worldwide to eligible creators. As Musk clarified, the program would give out $5 million in the first round of creator payments. In August, it lowered requirements for X‚Äôs creator payout program. Those creators who gain 5 million impressions in the previous three months (rolling) are eligible for ad revenue sharing. Before, the number of impressions was higher, at 15 million. To qualify for payouts, however, users also need to have over 500 followers.\n\nMusk also started talking about job postings on X. Although the feature doesn‚Äôt yet exist, some organizations have already started posting job listings, which take applicants to their websites where they submit their applications.\n\nIn addition to job listings, Twitter Notes came back in July 2023. This feature will allow users to publish long-form content when they have a lot to say. A month before that, X limited the number of tweets users can read daily. According to new rules, holders of verified accounts can read a maximum of 6,000 posts daily. In contrast, unverified users must be happy with only 600 posts a day. Recently registered, unverified users experience even stricter restrictions with an allowance of a meager 300 posts a day. But although subscribers can read less now, they can compose longer tweets. Twitter Blue subscribers are now permitted to post 25,000-character-long sentences. They can also choose any emoji to react to a DM in a conversation, and edit their posts if they spot a typo.\n\nThe list of changes introduced on X can go on almost ad infinitum. Considering Elon Musk‚Äôs inventiveness and impulsiveness, there is no guessing how far he can go in revolutionizing X in 2023 or several years down the line.\n\nX might become surprisingly different from the company we are familiar with now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter (X) competes with many companies, the strongest among which are Meta (Facebook and Instagram), YouTube, Google, and Snap.\n\nSo far, Twitter has managed lean years and mismanagement. It has suffered massive layoffs, service disruptions, and abandonment by top advertisers. But now Meta is dealing Twitter an even stronger blow with its Threads app. Within the first week, Threads boasted more than 100 million users. On its launch day, Threads users opened the app an average of 14 times and spent an average of 19 minutes scrolling through it. Although Threads‚Äô user count has fallen sharply since its launch, analysts still do not rule out the possibility that it will rival Twitter.\n\nTraffic analysts worry that a downfall for X has already begun as they notice a decline in X usage in the past several weeks. They predict that X‚Äôs users might be lured to defect to Threads, leaving Musk to fight a losing battle for customers‚Äô attention. Others are confident, however, that Musk is not easily cowed and might attack hard to retain the popularity of his social platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX Frequently Asked Questions\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nQ: Can I invest in Twitter (X)?\n\nAs of November 2022, Twitter (X) is no longer a listed company, meaning it isn‚Äôt possible to buy shares in the company.
