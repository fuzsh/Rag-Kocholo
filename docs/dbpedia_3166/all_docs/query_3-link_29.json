        "text": "I donât know what else you would want from a social media app. If you want entertainment you could find it, if you want knowledge on a business or company you may want to start you could find it, if you just want to kill time you could just go on and scroll. I think itâs my favorite social media app and it is very diverse from young to old people from people with all different intrests and hobbies educating each other on cool or interesting topics also unlike other apps it is not just a brain rot for low attention spans and it does not hurt anyone who wants to go on as long as you donât look at the wrong stuff. That is also why X is great is it gives you a freedom to post whatever and look at whatever so if you donât like what you see you could only blame yourself since that is what you have been looking and the algorithm is perfect if I look at something once it gives it to me maybe once more if I look up knicks game score I will get more updates on the score to knicks games and other NBA games.\n\nI have had Twitter since 2008. Longer than Iâve been an Apple user. It has gone downhill. Elonâs politics aside. The app is far less stable than it used to be. I often have to refresh three or four times to see my notifications. I now need to pay or download a third-party app in order to use two factor authentication that I had been using for years and years. The advertisements have gotten steadily scam here and scummier.\n\nWorst of all from a user perspective the content is worse. Not only is there a constant flood of bot interactions, but favoring âverifiedâ users means that every tweet you care about has 15 to 20 unrelated replies from bots that pay the $15 a month to try and chase down either more traffic or direct payouts. Itâs like the algorithm has been completely reworked to favor, low value, engagement farming.\n\nIâll see a tweet about some thing I care about like some Geo political event happening and then underneath it Iâll look and there will be 25 replies and 20 of them will be videos of cute animals or pictures of scantily clad girls, or stock trading advice. Then there will be a few responses to the tweet that actually matter scattered into the bottom. And finally Twitter, weâll stop serving responses and show me tweets âthat might interest youâ and it will be more of the same completely unrelated content.\n\nThere is almost a complete lack of unbiased and timely news and information once so plentiful and reliable on the previous platform. What once was a vast array of diverse subjects and topics both interesting and informative is now nothing but a political party battleground of anger and angst, where actual discussion, debate, and dialogue has been reduced to name calling, trash talking, and one upmanship . Vital and functional features of the app have been removed and/or replaced with useless non-social-media pay for/pay wall related garbage extensions, verification schemes, etc and subscription schemes designed to monetize the platform. Algorithm for X is highly slanted towards the right-wing MAGA agenda. Reporting of (what are we supposed to call them now) posts no longer includes the ability to report political attacks or blatantly misleading information/ lies. Most reports for vile posts/comments go unanswered. Lots of hate speech allowed/condoned under the guise of âfree speechâ. Even the owner of the company participates in posting/reposting vile content. Appeals for wrongfully reported posts go unanswered for months. This leaves no other recourse other than users must accept the strike to regain access/remove restrictions and it appears that the appeal is totally dropped at that point leaving a permanent strike on the userâs profile."
