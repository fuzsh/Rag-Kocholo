        "text": "Elon Musk's X/Twitter is suing a group of advertisers and major companies, accusing them of unlawfully agreeing to \"boycott\" the site.\n\nIt has filed a claim against the food giants Unilever and Mars, private healthcare company CVS Health, and renewable energy firm Orsted - along with a trade association called the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) - in a Texas court.\n\nX claims they have deprived it of \"billions of dollars\" in revenue.\n\nLegal experts say the case is unlikely to succeed as any collusion or agreement between companies will be hard to prove.\n\nThe lawsuit relates to the period in 2022 just after Mr Musk bought X, then known as Twitter, when advertising revenue dived.\n\nSome companies had been wary of advertising on the platform as concerns rose that its new owner was not serious enough about removing harmful online content.\n\nIn the year after Mr Musk bought what was formerly Twitter, advertising revenue slumped by more than half.\n\nX chief executive Linda Yaccarino said: \"People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted. No small group of people should monopolise what gets monetised.\"\n\nShe said the alleged \"boycott\" threatened the company's \"ability to thrive in the future\".\n\nMr Musk tweeted: \"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.\"\n\nThe WFA and the accused companies have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nLegal experts have suggested the case is unlikely to succeed.\n\n\"As a general rule, a politically motivated boycott is not an antitrust violation. It is protected speech under our First Amendment,\" said Bill Baer, who was assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's antitrust division under former US president Barack Obama.\n\nChristine Bartholomew, an antitrust expert and professor at University at Buffalo's law school said X needed to show there was an \"actual agreement to boycott joined by each advertiser\", which she said would be \"no small hurdle\" to prove.\n\nEven if the case succeeds, the social media site cannot force companies to buy advertising space on the platform.\n\nX is seeking unspecified damages and a court order against any continued efforts to conspire to withhold advertising spending."
