        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — When it comes to making money, Twitter is all about keeping it simple. There are no banner ads, no dancing animations, no ads inserted between screens that you must click to get past.\n\nVirtually all of the company’s revenue, which is projected to be nearly $600 million this year and $950 million next year, comes from three basic advertising formats that blend smoothly into its core microblogging service, whether users are accessing it from a mobile phone or a Web browser.\n\n“What they have been able to do very well is develop products that meet the needs of most advertisers without being overly complex,” said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst for social media at eMarketer, a research firm.\n\nBut the simplicity of Twitter’s products is also a weakness, especially when compared with other social networks like Facebook. The company does not have concrete demographic information about individual users, like gender and age, to allow it to sell highly targeted ads at expensive rates. And its marketing efforts have largely been oriented toward large advertisers in the United States, with few sales to smaller businesses and only about one-fifth of its ad revenue coming from overseas, Ms. Williamson said.\n\nTwitter, which announced last week that it had filed confidential paperwork to begin the process of selling stock in an initial public offering, has disclosed virtually no information about its finances. The company declined to comment for this article, citing regulatory restrictions surrounding its I.P.O.\n\nBut eMarketer estimates that the company will bring in $583 million in revenue from advertising this year, and $950 million in 2014. Twitter also makes additional revenue from selling the data in its raw feed of hundreds of millions of messages daily.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
