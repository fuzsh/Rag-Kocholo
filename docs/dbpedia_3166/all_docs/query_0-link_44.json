        "text": "Less than one month after Elon Musk acquired Twitter TWTR for $44 billion, some of the largest marketers and global ad agencies have put a pause on paid advertising with the micro blogging site. At the core of their concern is that under new management is Twitter still a brand safe environment for advertising.\n\nMarketers recommending a pause on Twitter comes at a time when the number of their employees has dropped from 7,400 three weeks ago to about 2,700. The departures were a result of layoffs, resignations and firings. Long-time executives, engineers, rapid responders (to troubleshoot emergencies from outages to hacks), corporate communications and ad sales personnel have departed. Musk has announced Twitter would now begin hiring, with a focus on engineers and ad sales.\n\nAnother issue has been the Twitter posts of Elon Musk, a self-proclaimed First Amendment absolutist. For example, Musk had posted misinformation on the attack of Paul Pelosi which was soon taken down. There is also evidence that since Musk took over there has been more hateful tweets and more inappropriate posts. This has further alarmed Madison Avenue.\n\nTo increase revenue Musk has also been looking at a subscription model. Consequently, Twitter has issued a new verification method called “Twitter Blue” in which any user can get a blue check for a monthly fee of $7.99. Since then, a number of false “verified” accounts were created posting a number damaging tweets which involved some prominent advertisers. For example, a fake Twitter account posted that pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly LLY would provide free insulin to customers. This resulted in a decline of their stock price of nearly 5%.\n\nAlso, a fake Nintendo account had Mario making an impolite hand gesture. A blue check Pepsi account simply posted Coke was better. Other examples of fake accounts involved Tesla, Lockheed Martin LMT and Nestle among other examples. Soon thereafter, Musk, while shelving the verified “paid” tweet strategy promised, \"Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them.\"\n\nA number of prominent ad agencies have advised their clients to put a pause on using Twitter as an ad vehicle. The Verge reported that Omnicom, one of the world’s largest ad agencies with over 5,000 global clients, cautioned their clientele about Twitter’s new verification decision. The ad agency cited the departure of top -level executives, brand safety and fake verification accounts among other reasons. Among Omnicom’s clients include McDonald’s, Apple AAPL , Mercedes-Benz and PepsiCo PEP .\n\nDigiday reports WPP’s GroupM, the world’s largest ad agency, has told their clients that Twitter has become a “high-risk” buy. For advertisers to return to Twitter GroupM listed a number of changes the social media company needs to make. These include re-staffing of senior level personnel for IT, security, privacy, trust and safety. Additionally, the resumption of internal checks and balances with full transparency on future developments. Also, GroupM said Twitter must make a demonstrated commitment to effective content moderation, enforcing current Twitter rules (e.g., account impersonation, violative content removal timing, intolerance of hate speech and misinformation, etc.). GroupM clients include Google GOOG , L’Oréal, Bayer and Nestle.\n\nRyan Barwick, a contributor at Morning Brew, an email newsletter, reported the Interpublic Group IPG , another prominent ad agency, has suggested to their clients to put any Twitter ad buys on hold for at least one week. In a note Mediabrands, IPG’s media agency, suggested Twitter should provide advertisers with their plans on trust and safety. The memo to clients said, \"the current situation is unpredictable and chaotic and bad actors and unsafe behaviors thrive in such an environment.” Mediabrands clients include Johnson & Johnson JNJ , CVS and Nintendo.\n\nHavas, another prominent global agency, has also advised clients about the current suitability of Twitter. The agency cited concerns about Twitter’s ability to have a brand safe environment for advertisers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports 40+ civil society groups have reached out to the 20 biggest Twitter advertisers asking them to suspend any activity on the microblogging site, “if Mr. Musk follows through on his plans to undermine brand safety and community standards including gutting content moderation.” In a note to advertisers Elon Musk told advertisers, “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThere is also a list of advertisers that have recently pulled their ad spending on Twitter independent of their agency’s recommendation. These include carmakers Audi and General Motors GM both competitors to Musk’s Tesla. With the important Holiday shopping season and Thanksgiving Day Parade approaching, Macy’s decided to pause all ad activity on Twitter. Other advertisers suspending ads on Twitter include United Airlines, General Mills GIS , Mondelez International (maker of Oreos), Allianz and Pfizer PFE .\n\nPlaybill, a familiar publication for Broadway theatergoers, announced they had dropped their Twitter account citing, \"greatly expanded its tolerance for hate, negativity, and misinformation”. Playbill had 412,000 Twitter followers said they would focus on other social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Also, Balenciaga, a fashion company, dropped its Twitter account. It’s reported over past two weeks one-third of Twitter’s top 100 marketers have not been advertising.\n\nGreg Garunov, EVP of Business and Strategic Development at Sightly, a market insights company says, “The situation we’re watching unfold with Twitter right now is a real-time study of the myriad of risks that advertisers face in today’s unsteady landscape. With risk avoidance being paramount for brands, Twitter will continue to lose lucrative business until the platform can prove it has regained stability and reinstated a genuine commitment to brand safety again.”\n\nStephen Magli, CEO and co-founder, AI Digital, notes, “Given the current state of responsible/credible and reputable news and journalism, identifying the appropriate platforms for our clients to be associated with is increasingly important. Consumers align with brands that support and advocate for their values and responsible journalism. That said, we must have the conversation with our clients regarding platforms and channels that might not reflect and/or align with our brands core values and demonstrate responsible journalism.”\n\nAdvertising is by far the biggest source of Twitter’s revenue. Last year advertising accounted for 90% of its total revenue of $5.08 billion. But revenue has been stalling before Musk’s acquisition was finalized. In second quarter 2022,, Twitter’s revenue of $1.18 billion failed to meet Wall Street’s estimate of $1.32 billion. It was Twitter’s biggest revenue miss to date. In addition, the revenue was 1% lower than second quarter 2021. Moreover, the number of monetized monthly active users of 237.8 million had failed to reach Wall Street’s estimates of 238.08 million.\n\nTwitter is not the only digital media company that has reported a revenue slowdown. In third quarter both Meta and Alphabet recorded their poorest earnings report since going public. More recently, Amazon AMZN became the first company to have its market valuation drop by $1 trillion in just over one year.\n\nWhile Twitter (unlike many other social networks) has many affluent, highly educated and influential users, a desirable target for many advertisers, Media Radar reports the average numbers of advertisers have dropped from 3,900 in May to 2,900 in September (in August it had bottomed out to 2,300).\n\nAnother challenge is advertisers continue to have more digital options other than Twitter. Recently, Netflix NFLX launched an ad supported tier and Disney+ will follow in December. Both looking to grow revenue are expected to generate billions in ad dollars each year.\n\nElon Musk has noted Twitter had suffered “a massive drop in revenue” and losing $4 million a day. Musk added filing for bankruptcy is an option. That would potentially result in an investment loss of $27 billion for the world’s richest person."
