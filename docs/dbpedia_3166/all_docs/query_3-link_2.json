Originally, users could only use 140 characters, although that has been elongated over the years.\n\nFormed by former Odeo employees Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Evan Williams and Biz Stone, the site originally used SMS to send tweets onto the network. It received its first boost of users at SXSW 2007, when the founders showed all the tweets hitting the network in real-time.\n\nFrom there, Twitter grew out its userbase to reach over 300 million monthly active users. It added new features, but for the most part has retained the same look and feel of early Twitter, much to the chagrin of shareholders who wanted Twitter to be more competitive with Facebook.\n\nTwitter has branched out into other areas of innovation, such as short-video with Vine or live-video with Periscope, but both were cancelled by the company. Some have argued that Twitter mismanaged both projects, as Vine came well before Music.ly and TikTok, but was unable to capture the market which was clearly there for the taking.\n\nThis may be partly due to the management of Twitter during that period, which included founder Jack Dorsey, then founder Evan Williams, then shortly after that Dick Costolo, followed by another Jack Dorsey turn. In the second round, Dorsey was also CEO at Block Inc (previously Square), which led to complaints from shareholders and even a lawsuit.\n\nIn 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, after months of back and forth between the company and Musk haggling the price. Musk cut more than half of the staff count, opened up the verified platform to all members, as long as they paid a monthly subscription, and in 2023 changed the name of the company to X.\n\nMusk has aims of making X a super-app, in the vein of WeChat in China. In this new app, users will have video and voice call options, messaging, mini-programs, and payment services. He has also unbanned a lot of banned for life accounts, such as Kanye West and ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe changes spooked advertisers, which have left the platform en-masse causing a drop of more than 50 percent in advertising revenues. It has also brought about a whole host of Twitter-alternatives, which include Instagram’s Threads.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on Twitter.
