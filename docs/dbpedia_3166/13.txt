Topline

Twitter is nearing profitability, its billionaire owner and CEO Elon Musk claimed in a Tuesday interview, sharing further details on his lofty long-term aspirations for his social media company and rekindling his hopes for a so-called superapp inspired by Chinese tech giant Tencent.

Key Facts

Key Background

PayPal, the world's largest online payment processor, handled $1.4 trillion in transactions last year. Twitter’s revenue was down 40% in December, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the first insight into the company’s financials since the completion of Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of the company in October. Musk has ruthlessly cut costs as Twitter’s CEO, cutting about 75% of the firm’s workforce and even auctioning off office items deemed unnecessary. Musk claims his efforts “saved” Twitter from bankruptcy.

Surprising Fact

Morgan Stanley is one of the seven banks who provided Musk with $12.5 billion in debt financing for his Twitter purchase. Twitter’s loan repayments did not come up in the Tuesday conversation.

Forbes Valuation

We estimate Musk to be worth $186 billion, making him the second-richest person on earth.

Tangent

Musk sparred with a recently fired Twitter employee in a viral Twitter thread Monday and Tuesday, apparently suggesting the worker’s disability made him unable to perform his role sufficiently.
