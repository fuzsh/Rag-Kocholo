        "text": "Olivia Newton-John, AO, OBE, is an English-born, Australian-raised singer, actress, and philanthropist who was recently the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from La Trobe University. With a career spanning more than five decades and more than 100 million albums sold, Olivia’s successes include four Grammys; numerous Country Music, American Music, Billboard, and People’s Choice Awards; an Emmy Award; ten #1 hits; and more than fifteen top-10 singles. She also scored another #1 hit, this time on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, with “You Have to Believe,” a duet with her daughter, Chloe Lattanzi—becoming the first mother/daughter duo to top this Billboard Chart. In 1978, her costarring role with John Travolta in Grease catapulted Olivia into super-stardom and to date it remains the most successful movie musical of all time. In 2018, the film celebrated its fortieth anniversary. Olivia has been a longtime activist for environmental and animal rights issues. Her personal journeys with cancer led her to announce her partnership with Austin Health and the creation of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre (ONJCWRC) on the Austin Campus in her hometown of Melbourne, Australia. She also coowns the award-winning Gaia Retreat & Spa near Byron Bay."
