In 2008, she appeared on the MTV reality competition Rock the Cradle, finishing in third place. In 2017, she had a role in the B-movie Sharknado 5.\n\nIn 2021, Olivia and Chloe released a duet together.\n\nWho is Olivia Newton-John's husband?\n\nOlivia Newton-John married her long-time boyfriend, actor Matt Lattanzi, in December 1984. They met four years earlier while filming Xanadu.\n\nTheir daughter, Chloe Rose, was born in January 1986. The couple divorced in 1995.\n\nIn June 2008, she secretly married John Easterling, founder and president of natural remedy firm, Amazon Herb Company. They had first met 15 years earlier, but they only became romantically involved in 2007.\n\nWhen Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta reunited after 24 years to sing ‘You’re The One That I Want’\n\nOlivia was previously in a relationship with Patrick McDermott, an American cameraman of Korean descent.\n\nHowever, he disappeared in 2005 while on a fishing trip. The then 48-year-old mysteriously vanished, with personal items, including his wallet, left aboard. Various publications and TV shows have claimed that he is still alive in recent years.\n\nWhen and how did Olivia Newton-John die?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, and received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.\n\nShe later recovered, and has since become an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. Proceeds from several of her albums have benefited breast cancer research.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that her breast cancer had returned and metastasized to her lower back. In March 2018, she gave an update on her condition, saying she felt \"really good\".\n\nIn 2021, she gave another positive update, saying she feels \"really wonderful\".\n\nOn August 8, 2022, Olivia sadly passed away at the age of 73 from cancer.\n\nIn a statement posted to her social media channels, Newton-John's husband John Easterling praised her as \"a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer\".\n\n\"Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer.\"\n\nDid Olivia Newton-John take part in Eurovision?\n\nEurovision 1974 - United Kingdom - Olivia Newton John - Long Live Love\n\nIn 1974, Olivia Newton-John represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song 'Long Live Love'.\n\nThe song was chosen by the British public out of six possible entries, though she later admitted that she disliked the song.\n\nShe finished fourth at the contest held in Brighton, behind ABBA's winning Swedish entry, 'Waterloo'.\n\nDid Olivia Newton-John have any siblings?\n\nShe is the youngest of three children, following brother Hugh, a doctor, and sister Rona.\n\nRona was also an actress who was married to Olivia's Grease co-star Jeff Conaway from 1980 until their divorce in 1985. She passed away in 2013 aged 72 from brain cancer."
