        "text": "Olivia Newton-John, the actress and singer, who has died of cancer aged 73, was best known for her starring role opposite John Travolta in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Grease (1978); she later revived her singing career and sold some 100 million records worldwide, becoming the most successful solo artist Australia has ever produced.\n\nAn uplifting tale of high-school love set in late 1950s America, Grease was an instant box-office smash. Olivia Newton-John played the part of Sandy, a prim schoolgirl led gratefully astray by the Brylcreemed rebel, Danny (Travolta).\n\nImpressed by Danny’s hot-rodding prowess, Sandy kicks off her hooped skirtings and bobby-sox, and turns out at the vacation party as a vampy rocker, with frizzed-up hair and skintight Spandex trousers.\n\nThat Danny is supposed to have met his match is not wholly convincing – the wholesome, doe-eyed Olivia failed ever to look as if she had really sprung from the wrong side of the tracks. But the film had a sunny retro charm, energy and humour and produced several enduring hits – You’re the One That I Want, Danny and Sandy’s high-energy finale, topped the singles’ charts on both sides of the Atlantic, as did Sandy’s solo number Hopelessly Devoted to You.\n\nGrease brought Olivia Newton-John international fame, although she had been working as a singer since the late 1960s and was 30 when the film was released and had topped the American music charts with such songs as Let Me Be There and Come on Over.\n\nHer second film after Grease was Xanadu (1980), a rather ill-conceived musical fantasy in which she played a daughter of Zeus who wafts down to Earth to inspire a 1940s clarinettist (Gene Kelly) to set up a roller-skating disco-niterie. It was a universal flop – to the point of gaining a cult following for being one of the worst films of all time – but the soundtrack album was a major success and title track Xanadu (performed by Olivia Newton-John and ELO) was a No 1 in Britain.\n\nShe continued to retain her strong mass appeal, and defied critical attempts to put her down for being bland. “If white bread could sing it would sound like Olivia,” one cruel critic observed. In fact, her soprano voice, with its pleasing husky quiver, was not nearly so negligible as her detractors claimed.\n\nUltimately what ensured her a following was her spectacularly marketable niceness, and even those who were not fans of her music found it difficult not to like her. In the 1990s, after being treated for breast cancer, she talked openly about her illness and campaigned for increasing awareness of the importance of early diagnosis.\n\nA willowy, blue-eyed blonde, Newton-John always retained a winsome girl-next-door fragility about her. And she always insisted that, underneath, away from the “vulgar” business of show business, she was still just that. “Criticism doesn’t upset me any more,” she told one interviewer. “I figured out that there are lots of people out there who like white bread.”\n\nThe youngest of three children of a Welshman, Brinley “Bryn” Newton-John, and his wife Irene (née Born), Olivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge on September 26 1948, but she was brought up in Australia, where her father, who had worked at Bletchley Park during the war, was a professor of German at the University of Melbourne. The family had distinguished academic roots: Olivia’s grandfather was Max Born, the Nobel Laureate German physicist.\n\nWhen she was nine her parents divorced, an event which she claimed scarred her for life – the split was considered such a scandal that her father was dismissed from his university post. Young Olivia showed a gift for music as a child, and at 14, while a pupil at University High School, she and some friends started a singing group. A year later they won a talent competition, of which the first prize was a trip to England.\n\nAgainst the stern advice of her father, she decided to drop out of school and remain in London. Teamed up with the young Australian singer Pat Carroll (later Pat Farrar), she spent the next few years performing in “all the divey clubs and pubs in places like Leeds and Bournemouth”.\n\nOne night they were booked to sing at Raymond’s Revue Bar in Soho. When the girl who performed before them went on stage and swam nude in a fish tank, Olivia Newton-John realised that her flowery frock would not go down well with the all-male audience outside; and was relieved when, after one trembling round of Singin’ in the Rain, the manager paid them off.\n\nFor a while her career seemed to be stalling before it had ever really taken off, but after joining a group called Toomorrow, she gained a break with an accompanying part in a series of Cliff Richard television specials.\n\nBy the early 1970s, American record firms began to show a growing interest in her and she flew out to the US to embark on a rigorous schedule of concerts, from campus halls to Las Vegas hotels. MCA Records soon offered her a contract and she began working on recordings for them in 1973.\n\nWithin 18 months she had stormed the American charts with three hits, If Not For You (written by Bob Dylan), Let Me Be There, and I Honestly Love You.\n\nBack in Britain in 1974 she made an appearance at the Eurovision Song Contest, representing Britain with Long Live Love, a rather saccharine ditty even for 1970s Eurovision – she herself thought it was a bit of a stinker. It lost out to Abba’s Waterloo.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, she was voted Female Vocalist of the Year by the Country Music Association in Nashville and Elvis Presley added Let Me Be There and her 1974 hit If You Love Me Let Me Know to his own concert repertoire.\n\nIn 1975 her hit singles included Have You Never Been Mellow, Please Mr Please and Something Better Do. The next year she had a number one country single Come On Over.\n\nAt around that time Olivia Newton-John decided to settle in America. She cancelled her plan to marry Bruce Welch, a member of the Shadows, and moved to Los Angeles, where she set up home with Lee Kramer, whom she had met on holiday in Monte Carlo. Kramer, equally smitten, gave up his business importing cowboy boots to Europe, and devoted himself to managing her career.\n\nThe partnership was a fruitful one. In 1978 a new solo album, Totally Hot, did well. The Xanadu album went platinum, and her first solo album, Physical (1981), was another spectacular seller. The title track was voted “Sexiest Song of All Time” by Billboard in 2010. Indeed, the lyrics were deemed so provocative that two American radio stations banned the song. The video – which was themed around a fantasy gym with a lithe and perky Olivia in shocking pink leggings – had the dubious honour of sparking the Eighties craze for headbands.\n\nAnother film, Two of a Kind, in which John Travolta also co-starred, was also a cinematic dud; but again, its score brought her a hit single, Twist of Fate.\n\nIn 1983, with her friend Pat Farrar, Olivia Newton-John opened a shop selling designer sportswear in Hollywood called Koala Blue. This blossomed into a chain of some 60 shops around the world before going bust in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter her marriage, in 1984, to the actor Matt Lattanzi, whom she had met on the set of Xanadu, and the birth, two years later, of their daughter Chloe, Olivia Newton-John took time out from her career, returning with the LPs The Rumour (1988), the title track of which was written and produced by Elton John, and Warm and Tender (1989), an album of lullabies inspired by the birth of her daughter.\n\nNeither made much of a dent in the charts and in 1992, while she was preparing for a comeback with a compilation album and a new tour to promote it, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nFollowing her treatment she became increasingly involved in health issues and set up the Gaia Retreat and Spa in Byron Bay, Australia. She also released an album, Gaia: One Woman’s Journey (1994), which reflected on her experience of the illness.\n\nShe continued to record and tour well into her sixties, including 100 nights a year in Las Vegas, where in 2014 and 2015 she performed a retrospective of her career – Grease, Xanadu, country music, and her post-cancer songs, closing with her signature song, I Honestly Love You.\n\n“[Singing] is all I know, truthfully,” she said in 2016. “Since I was 15, this is what I’ve done.”\n\nA keen conservationist – she once cancelled a concert tour of Japan to protest against the slaughter of dolphins caught in fishing nets – she was a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme. In 2008 she raised money to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne.\n\nIn May 2017 she announced that she was cancelling her US and Canadian tour dates following the return of her cancer. She was appointed DBE in 2020.\n\nAfter her divorce from Lattanzi in 1995, Olivia Newton-John had a relationship with a cameraman, Patrick McDermott, which ended in 2005 after he was reported missing and presumed drowned following a fishing trip off the Californian coast. In 2008 she married John Easterling, founder of the Amazon Herb Company.\n\nHe survives her with her daughter from her first marriage.\n\nOlivia Newton-John, born September 26 1948, died August 8 2022"
