        "text": "Olivia Newton-John’s appeal seems to be timeless. With a career spanning more than five decades she is still a vibrant, creative individual adored by fans around the globe. Born in Cambridge, England in 1948, the youngest child of Professor Brin Newton-John and Irene, daughter of Nobel Prize winning physicist, Max Born, Olivia moved to Melbourne, Australia with her family when she was five. Her first big break was winning a talent contest on the popular TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” which earned Olivia a trip to London. By the age of fifteen she had formed an all-girl group called Sol 4 and, in 1963, Olivia was appearing on local daytime TV shows and weekly pop music programs in Australia. When she eventually took her prize-winning trip to London, she teamed up with her friend from Melbourne, Pat Carroll (now Pat Farrar), to create a double act, “Pat & Olivia,” and the duo toured army bases and clubs throughout the UK and Europe. Olivia cut her first single for Decca Records in 1966, a version of Jackie DeShannon’s “Till You Say You’ll Be Mine,” and in 1971, she recorded a cover of Bob Dylan’s “If Not For You,” co-produced by Bruce Welch and fellow Aussie and friend, John Farrar, whom she continues to collaborate with today.\n\nOlivia’s U.S. album debut, “Let Me Be There,” produced her first top ten single of the same name, with Olivia being honored by the Academy Of Country Music as “Most Promising Female Vocalist” and a Grammy Award as “Best Country Vocalist.” This proved to be only the beginning of a very exciting career. With more than 100 million albums sold, Olivia’s successes include four Grammy Awards, numerous Country Music, American Music and Peoples Choice Awards, ten #1 hits including “Physical,” (which topped the charts for ten consecutive weeks making it the #1 single of the ‘80s), and over 15 top 10 singles. In November 2015, Billboard Magazine listed “Physical” at #8 on their “Top 100 Songs Of All Time” list and in 2010 listed it as “The Sexiest Song of All Time.” In addition, in 2015 Olivia was ranked #20 on Billboard’s “Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists” and most recently was ranked #7 on Billboard’s “Greatest Of All Time Hot 100 Women Artists.”\n\nIn 1978, her co-starring role with John Travolta in “Grease” catapulted Olivia into super-stardom and earned her a Golden Globe nomination as “Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical of Comedy.” This film’s best-selling soundtrack featured the duets “You’re The One That I Want” and “Summer Nights,” with Travolta, as well as her mega-hit, “Hopelessly Devoted To You.” To date “Grease” remains the most successful movie musical in history. Her other feature film credits include “Funny Things Happen Down Under,” “Toomorrow,” “Xanadu,” “Two Of A Kind,” “It’s My Party,” “Sordid Lives,” “Score: A Hockey Musical,” and “A Few Best Men.”\n\nThroughout her career, the much-loved star, who danced with Gene Kelly in “Xanadu,” hosted the popular internationally syndicated “Wild Life” television show, was bestowed an O.B.E. (Order Of The British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth in 1979, has held many humanitarian causes close to her heart, particularly since the birth of her daughter Chloe in 1986. Olivia was named the first Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme and in 1991, served as the national spokesperson for the Children’s Health Environmental Coalition (CHEC), which was founded after the tragic death of Chloe’s best friend from a rare childhood cancer. Her devotion and shared commitment to CHEC’s (now Healthy Child, Healthy World) mission and goals enabled the organization to receive worldwide attention and support. (For more information visit www.HealthyChild.org).\n\nHer charmed life has not been without its share of upset. In the early 90’s, Olivia successfully overcame her first journey with breast cancer, which inspired her self-penned and produced album, “Gaia,” her most personal album reflecting upon her experiences with cancer. As a breast cancer “thriver,” Olivia has become increasingly well known and respected for talking openly about her personal journey with breast cancer and for promoting public awareness of the importance of early detection for more than 25 years. This led her to announce her partnership with Austin Health and the creation of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre (ONJCWC) on the Austin Campus in her hometown of Melbourne, Australia. In April 2008, Olivia led a team of fellow cancer survivors, celebrities and Olympians on a trek along the Great Wall of China and raised more than $2 million to find a new way to treat cancer and build the ONJCWC. After continuing the fundraising efforts and helping to raise nearly $200 million, the ONJCWC, opened in June 2012, and provides a comprehensive range of services and facilities for cancer treatment, education, training and research including a wellness center for the mind, body and spirit (ONJCancerCentre.org). In 2014, Olivia was thrilled when the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute opened on the grounds of the ONJCWC. The strategic co-location of research laboratories and research-training within a clinical environment enables clinicians and researchers to work together to integrate clinical medicine with basic and translational cancer research for the ultimate benefit of cancer patients.\n\nSome of Gaia’s most recent accolades include the World Travel Awards 2019, World’s Leading Retreat (Global Winner); World Luxury Restaurant Awards 2019,Luxury Spa Restaurant (Global Winner); World Spa Awards 2019, World’s Best Day Spa (Global Winner); World Luxury Hotel Awards 2019, Luxury Boutique Retreat (Continent Winner); World Luxury Spa Awards 2019, Best Luxury Spa Retreat (Continent Winner) and Best Luxury Wellness Spa (Country Winner). Gaia’s unique wellness & healing ethos has truly set it apart by offering guests total flexibility to personally tailor their retreat experience. Gaia’s award-winning Day Spa is “home” to some of Australia’s best healers and therapists, with leading wellness consultants, yoga instructors and fitness coaches available to meet the guests every need. Add to this Gaia’s highly acclaimed world class spa cuisine, which has received numerous awards, including, most recently, the 2019 World Luxury Restaurant Award for Best Health & Wellness Cuisine (Global Winner). Olivia was also honored with the Wellness Pioneer Award 2019 during the World Spa Awards gala event at the landmark Armani Hotel Dubai, receiving the top accolade for her outstanding contribution to the wellness industry.\n\nIn 2006, Olivia received the AO (Officer of the Order of Australia) in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List for her services to the entertainment industry as a singer and actor, and to the community through organizations supporting breast cancer treatment, education, training and research, and the environment. In 2010 Governor General Quentin Bryce invested Ms. Olivia Newton-John AO OBE as an Officer of the Order of Australia at a ceremony in Canberra. That year she also received the “Lifetime Achievement Award,” presented by friend John Travolta at the G’Day L.A. Gala.\n\nOlivia’s 2007 holiday recording, “Christmas Wish” features both new and classic holiday favorites and duets with such Grammy winners as Barry Manilow, Michael McDonald, David Foster and Jon Secada, to name a few, and was called one of the “Best Holiday CDs of 2007” by USA Today. That year she also premiered her first concert special for Public Television – “Olivia Newton-John: Live From Sydney!” filmed at the historic Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony. A two-hour DVD release of this stunning performance, featuring additional concert footage and Olivia’s personal tour of some of her favorite spots in Sydney, was released by Capitol / EMI in January 2008 and subsequently became a favorite concert special on PBS. In 2008, Olivia began co-hosting and co-producing the PBS series, “Healing Quest” and, she reprised her film role of Bitsy Mae Harling from “Sordid Lives” in the LOGO series to rave reviews.\n\nIn 2008, Olivia married “Amazon John” Easterling and, together they are spreading the word about the importance of preserving the Rainforest and the health values found in the botanicals of the Amazon. They currently serve on the Board of the ACEER Organization (Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research) to help the indigenous people of the Amazon gain ownership and title to their land. In September 2009, they also joined forces with Prince Charles’ The Prince’s Rainforest Project to further stress the global importance of preserving the Rainforest.\n\nIn 2010, Olivia appeared as herself in two episodes of the hit series, “Glee,” adding another Top 100 hit to her credits with a new version of “Physical” sung with Jane Lynch. In October 2010 Olivia starred in the breast cancer docudrama “1 A Minute” and, the Canadian film “Score: A Hockey Musical.” Her 2012 film, “A Few Best Men,” garnered her some of the best reviews of her film career. The soundtrack to the film features dance remixes of classic hits such as “Sugar Sugar” and “Daydream Believer” recorded by Olivia and remixed by some of the hottest club remixers in the world. In addition the CD reunited Olivia with her longtime producer and songwriter, John Farrar, on the single, “Weightless.”\n\nIn addition to starring in films and on television and writing books and music, Olivia continued to spend time in the recording studio. Her healing CD, “Grace and Gratitude: Renewed” (2010), debuted at #2 on the Billboard Magazine New Age chart. Billboard celebrated Olivia’s new music by saying, “Newton-John is soulfully committed to every word she sings, and fans will be taken by the plush arrangements, melodic warmth, and of course, the artist’s regal vocals.”\n\nOlivia released her second book, LivWise: Easy Recipes For A Healthy, Happy Life (Murdoch Books) in Australia in 2011. (Her first book, A Pig Tale, an environmentally-themed story written for children, was released in 1993.) In LivWise, Olivia explains her belief in the importance of eating a healthy diet in order to maintain wellness and balance and, Olivia’s proceeds from the sale of the book benefit the ONJCWRC. In 2012, she reunited with John Travolta to release “This Christmas,” a holiday CD collection that was also a fundraiser for both the ONJCWRC and The Jett Travolta Foundation. That year Olivia was also named one of Australia’s “National Living Treasures” by the National Trust of Australia, and in 2013 she was bestowed her own stamp as part of the “Australia Post Legends” stamp series.\n\nIn April 2014, Olivia began her residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas with “Summer Nights,” a musical journey through her career in movies and music. To coincide with the show, she released “Hotel Sessions” an EP collection of songs recorded in hotel rooms in Melbourne over a ten-year period with her nephew Brett Goldsmith. The CD is dedicated to her late sister Rona Newton-John, who was always supportive of Olivia and Brett working together. Due to the popularity of the Las Vegas show, a 2-CD set, “Summer Nights – Live in Las Vegas” was released. The show, originally scheduled for one year turned into a hit, three-year concert residency that received acclaim from both critics and fans. Olivia was thrilled that a portion of every ticket sold to her Flamingo shows benefited the Wellness Programs at the ONJCWRC.\n\nFor Newton-John, 2015 proved to be a chart topping and award-winning year. She topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart with the #1 hit duet, “You Have to Believe,” with her daughter Chloe. In April of 2015 Olivia toured arenas in Australia with fellow Aussie icon, John Farnham, with the aptly titled show, “Two Strong Hearts.” A CD of highlights from this sold-out tour debuted at #1 on the Aria Album charts, where it remained in the top spot for three weeks. The CD went on to receive an Aria Award nomination and, the live DVD held the #1 spot on the Aria DVD chart for 10 weeks.\n\nIn 2016 Olivia released two recording projects back to back. The first, “LIV ON,” a collaborative, inspiring new CD with friends Beth Nielsen Chapman and Amy Sky is intended for those who wish to transcend loss while walking a journey toward new-found meaning and hope. In addition, Olivia reunited with John Farnham for the holiday release, “Friends for Christmas,” which topped the Aria Chart.\n\nIn 2017 Olivia revealed the very personal news that her breast cancer had returned and metastasized to her sacrum. The outpouring of love and support from around the world prompted the following statement from Olivia: “I am really grateful for and touched by the worldwide outpouring of love and concern. Thank you. I am feeling good and enjoying total support from my family and friends, along with a team of wellness and medical practitioners both here in the US and at my Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia. I’m totally confident that my new journey will have a positive success story to inspire others!”\n\n2018 proved to be a big year for Olivia. In addition to focusing on her health and recovery, Olivia joined John Travolta for a special Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences “Grease” 40th Anniversary event to celebrate the milestone. She also released “Hopelessly Devoted: The Hits” on SONY Music Australia and, recorded two duets with fellow Aussie Delta Goodrem, “Let Me Be There” and “Love Is a Gift,” for Goodrem’s ONJ tribute CD, “I Honestly Love You.” Olivia also reunited in the studio with long-time friend, Sir Cliff Richard, for the duet “Everybody’s Someone,” their first recording together since 1995, for Richard’s new CD, “Rise Up.”\n\nIn May 2018, Olivia, who hails from a family of academics, was thrilled to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, in recognition of her significant and ongoing support of cancer research and holistic health, as well as her outstanding achievements in the entertainment industry.\n\nImmediately following in November 2018, it was announced that her Gaia Retreat & Spa claimed the coveted 2018 “Global Hotel of the Year” honor at an international gala ceremony which recognizes and honors the world’s finest hotels for their luxury offerings and delivery of exceptional guest services.\n\nIn February 2019 Olivia is proud to release the skincare range, Retreatment Botanics, inspired by the heart of Gaia Retreat & Spa. The natural, luxury formulas are Australian made, cruelty free, vegan, certified palm oil free by the Orangutan Alliance and contain powerful native extracts. “We created a range you can take home and enjoy a Gaia Retreatment any time,” says Olivia.\n\nIn September 2018, Olivia released her deeply personal, best-selling memoir, “Don’t Stop Believin’,” on Penguin Books in Australia. The book tells Olivia’s story for the first time in her own words. “I hope this story of my life from my early years up to today will bring some inspiration and positivity to the reader,” says Newton-John. “We all share so many experiences in our own unique way.” “Don’t Stop Believin’” was released as both a hardcover and audio book in North America on Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster on March 12, 2019, and it debuted at #12 on the New York Times Best Sellers list, as well as #7 on the Publisher’s Weekly list.\n\n2019 was a big year with Olivia receiving the appointment as a Companion (AC) of the Order of Australia (General Division) – the highest Australian honor, for her eminent service to community health, particularly people living with cancer, through support for medical research, and as a songwriter and performer. The Order of Australia is the principal means of recognizing meritorious service of its citizens and outstanding members of the community at a national level.\n\nThe 7th annual Wellness Walk and Research Run benefiting the ONJCWRC was held in October 2019 and raised over $1 million to support both wellness and research programs. The annual Wellness Walk and Research Run is now a global event, helping the ONJ Centre provide an environment that supports the whole person – body, mind and spirit – giving patients and their families the best chance to win over cancer.\n\nIn November 2019 the Olivia Newton-John Julien’s Auction took place in Beverly Hills where Olivia’s famous black leather jacket and skin tight pants featured during “You’re The One That I Want” in “Grease” sold for more than $405,000, with 100% of the proceeds benefiting her Centre. In a twist of pure kindness, the ultimate holiday “re-gift” happened when the buyer of her leather jacket surprised everyone by returning the jacket to Olivia, saying it belonged with her, “not in some billionaire’s closet.” Newton-John plans to display the jacket at her ONJ Cancer Wellness & Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOlivia also reunited with John Travolta for the “Meet ‘N’ Grease” Sing-A-Long movie events in West Palm Beach, Tampa and Jacksonville. The reunion also included the film’s director, Randal Kleiser, and the original T-Birds, Kelly Ward, Michael Tucci and Barry Pearl. Audiences had the chance to meet the two film stars, sing along with the famous film and then participate in a special Q&A session with Olivia and John.\n\nThe year ended with a major announcement and honor for Olivia in December 2019. Her Majesty the Queen named Olivia Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to music, cancer research and charity.\n\nIn November 2020, Olivia established the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, an independent charity sponsoring global research into plant medicine for cancer. These investments in new scientific research will educate patients and their caregivers about kinder options for treating cancer. The charity is committed to realizing a world beyond cancer. For more information visit ONJFoundationFund.org.\n\nIn February 2021 Olivia and her daughter Chloe reunited for a second single, “Window in the Wall” which debuted at #1 on the iTunes Music Video Chart and the Amazon A/C Chart. Just a few months later Olivia scored another #1 hit on the Amazon A/C chart with “Put Your Head on My Shoulder,” a duet with music legend Paul Anka. 2021 will also mark the 40th anniversary of her mega-hit, “Physical,” which spent 10 weeks at #1 on the Billboard chart, making it the number one song of the 1980s.\n\nWith her current and ongoing projects and philanthropic endeavors, Olivia’s worldwide popularity is as strong as ever!
