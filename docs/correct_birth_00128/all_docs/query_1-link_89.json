        "text": "She was a universally beloved popstar ❤️\n\nKnown best for her famous role of Sandra Dee Olsson, aka \"Sandy\", in the hit 1978 musical film Grease, Olivia Newton-John enjoyed a fantastic singing and acting career before her sad passing on 8th August 2022.\n\nHer stream of hit songs included five Number 1 US singles, with four Grammy Awards under her belt as well as over 100 million records sold worldwide. You'll most likely agree, there's still nothing better to do than dance around to 'You're the One That I Want' or 'I Honestly Love You.'\n\nTo celebrate her life and career, we've decided to look back at Olivia Newton-John's biggest hits through the years.\n\n1 - 'I Honestly Love You'\n\n'I Honestly Love You' became Olivia Newton-John's first Number 1 single in the US and Canada in 1974. Released on the album 'Long Live Love' in the UK and 'If You Love Me, Let Me Know' in the US, the track became Olivia Newton-John's signature song. The record also went to Number 1 in Australia and Sweden, but only charted at Number 22 in the UK.\n\nIn 1975, she won the 'Record of the Year' Grammy Award, as well as 'Female Pop Vocal Performance' for this song.\n\n2 - 'Have You Never Been Mellow'\n\n'Have You Never Been Mellow' was the title track released from the album of the same name in 1975. The single soared to the top of the charts in the US, and was Olivia Newton-John's first charting single in Japan, peaking at Number 26.\n\n3 - 'You're the One That I Want'\n\nOne of her most iconic songs, 'You're the One That I Want' was released in 1978 following the success of Grease. John Travolta, who played Olivia's love interest Danny Zuko in Grease, features in the song. It soared to the top of the charts in nearly every single country, including the UK and the US.\n\n'You're the One That I Want' is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 6 million copies in the UK, US and France alone, with an additional 9 million sold worldwide.\n\n4 - 'Summer Nights'\n\nSimilar to 'You're the One That I Want', 'Summer Nights' from Grease became a huge hit across the globe, charting at Number 1 in the UK and Number 5 in the US.\n\n5 - 'Xanadu'\n\n'Xanadu' is the title-track of the soundtrack to the film of the same name. Released in 1980, the song, which features the Electric Light Orchestra, reached Number 1 in the UK - the only song of ELO's to go to the top spot. Olivia starred as the lead character in the film.\n\nInteresting, the film performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack by Olivia Newton-John has made the film internationally recognised!\n\n6 - 'Physical'\n\nReleased in 1981 from her 12th studio album of the same name, 'Physical' shot straight to Number 1 in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Belgium and peaked at Number 7 in the UK. And in 1983, the music video to accompany the single won a Grammy Award.\n\nOlivia celebrated the hit single's 40th anniversary on twitter and released a deluxe edition of the album on 24th September 2021.\n\nShe tweeted: 'It’s time to get PHYSICAL again! Pre-order the DELUXE EDITION in honor of the 40th Anniversary!'\n\n7 - 'Make a Move on Me'\n\n'Make a Move on Me' was produced and released in 1982 from Olivia Newton-John's 'Physical' album. It charted at Number 5 in the US, but peaked at Number 43 in the UK.\n\n8 - 'Twist of Fate'\n\n'Twist of Fate' was certified Gold in 1983 after its release, despite only charting at Number 57 in the UK. However, it was a success in the US, reaching Number 5.\n\n9 - 'Had to Be'\n\nIn this 1995 duet with Cliff Richard, 'Had to Be' only charted in the UK, peaking at Number 22. Despite having Cliff Richard on the record, it failed to pack a punch, missing out on the Top 100 in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Belgium.\n\n10 - 'You Have to Believe'\n\nFollowing a string of single releases, Olivia hit the jackpot in 2015 with 'You Have to Believe' after she collaborated with Dave Audé and her daughter, Chloe Lattanzi. The song went to Number 1 in the US Dance charts.\n\nLet's get to know Olivia Newton-John a little bit better...\n\nWho was Olivia Newton-John?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was a British-Australian singer, songwriter and actress, most famous for her breakout role as Sandra Dee \"Sandy\" Olsson in the 1978 classic Grease. She went on to win four Grammy Awards, released 98 singles, produced 14 albums, as well as sell over 100 million records worldwide.\n\nHow old was Olivia Newton-John when she died?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born on 26th September 1948, and was 73-years-old when she died in August 2022. She was honoured with a state memorial service in February 2023, as thousands of people turned out to pay their respects in Melbourne.\n\nOlivia Newton-John's memorial service\n\nA whole host of famous faces paid tribute to Olivia including Elton John, Dolly Parton, Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and Mariah Carey. Her widower, John Easterling, gave a moving speech where he described the first time he'd heard her sing as a \"laser beam in the chest\", adding: \"Olivia was a healer, and this was one of her mediums of healing.\"\n\nSir Elton John said: \"She was such a wonderful force of nature, she was funny, kind, warm and talented and every time we got together we laughed and laughed and laughed. Throughout her career I have watched her grow and grow and grow to be the artist she became.\"\n\nDolly Parton added: \"As a country, you should be very proud and know that the whole world mourns with you. Now, I had the honour of singing with her several times. I considered her a great friend as well as a fellow entertainer. Olivia, to quote one of your songs, 'I honestly love you'. Thank you for shining your light on us.\"\n\nWhere was Olivia Newton-John from?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge, England, but her and her family emigrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1954 when she was six-years-old.\n\nHow did Olivia Newton-John become famous?\n\nEarly success\n\nOlivia Newton-John first rose to fame in 1971 after she released her debut album, 'If Not for You.' Despite it charting at Number 158, the album produced many singles including, 'If Not for You' and 'Banks of the Ohio.' The latter record charted in the Top 10 in the UK. It was following the success of this single when she started to regularly feature on Cliff Richard's weekly show, 'It's Cliff Richard.'\n\nEurovision\n\nFollowing the success of her early musical works, Olivia Newton-John was picked by the British public to represent the country at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the song 'Long Live Love.' She finished fourth behind ABBA's winning entry 'Waterloo.'\n\nGrease\n\nIt wasn't until 1978, when Olivia Newton-John landed the lead role of Sandy Olsson in the musical film Grease alongside John Travolta, that her fame sky-rocketed.\n\nThe film became the biggest box office hit in 1978, with the soundtrack album spending 12 non-consecutive weeks at Number 1, and spawning various hit singles. 'Hopelessly Devoted to You' and 'Summer Nights' were both in the Billboard Top 5 at the same time, meaning Olivia Newton-John is one of just two women, the other being Linda Ronstadt, to have two singles simultaneously be in the US Top 5.\n\nHowever, Olivia Newton-John nearly turned down her most iconic role after a string of unsuccessful movies. She had previously appeared in the 1965 film, 'Funny Things Happen Down Under', as well as 'Toomorrow' in 1970.\n\nSpeaking on the Mammamia No Filter podcast, Olivia Newton-John confessed, \"I really wasn't sure I wanted to do the movie because I'd made a movie before in England, which was a musical, and it didn't work, so I was very frightened about doing a movie.\"\n\nWhich other TV shows and films has Olivia Newton-John been in?\n\n'Funny Things Happen Down Under' (1965) - Starred as Olivia\n\n'Toomorrow' (1970) - Starred as Olivia\n\n'Grease' (1978) - Starred as Sandy Olsson\n\n'Xanadu' (1980) - Starred as Kira\n\n'Two of a Kind' (1983) - Starred as Debbie Wylder\n\n'A Mom for Christmas' (1990) - Starred as Amy Miller\n\n'A Christmas Romance' (1984) - Starred as Julia Stonecypher\n\n'It's My Party' (1996) - Starred as Lina Bingham\n\nSordid Lives (2000) - Starred as Bitsy Mae Harling\n\nThe Wilde Girls (2001) - Starred as Jasmine Wilde\n\n1 a Minute (2010) - Starred as herself\n\nScore: A Hockey Musical (2010) - Starred as Hope Gordon\n\nGlee (2010) - Starred as herself\n\nA Few Best Men (2011) - Starred as Barbara Ramme\n\nSharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017) - Starred as Orion\n\nThe Very Excellent Mr. Dundee (2020) - Starred as Olivia\n\nWas Olivia Newton-John married?\n\nOlivia Newton-John was married twice. She first married her long-time boyfriend Matt Lattanzi in 1984. The pair welcomed their daughter, Chloe Rose, in 1986, but got divorced in 1995.\n\nShe then went on to date Patrick McDermott, a cameraman, from 1996 for nine years. However, in 2005, Patrick McDermott disappeared on a fishing trip off the Californian coast and hasn't been seen, or found, since.\n\nOlivia Newton-John married John Easterling, founder and president of the Amazon Herb Company, in Peru in 2008. They first \"married\" in an Incan spiritual ceremony, followed by a legal ceremony nine days later.\n\nDid Olivia Newton-John date John Travolta?\n\nSurprisingly, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta never dated, busting the myth that all co-stars end up in relationships with each other! However, Olivia Newton-John has since admitted it was a conscious decision for the pair not to date as they didn't want to \"ruin the chemistry\" they had.\n\nSpeaking on the Mammamia No Filter podcast, she said: \"We were both with other people when we were filming and I think, respectfully, it just didn’t happen.\n\n\"I think it was good, because I think it kept the tension there and the chemistry. It might have been a real disaster had we decided to date or we had a falling out or something. So I think it was just as well that it didn’t happen. But we’re still great friends.\"\n\nOlivia Newton-John's health\n\nOlivia was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, and it returned in 2013 after getting the all-clear. She didn't announce her second cancer diagnosis until she revealed it has returned for the third time in 2019. She sadly passed away from the disease on 8th August 2022.\n\nDid Olivia Newton-John continue to sing after Grease?\n\nAfter Grease, Olivia Newton-John released various albums, including one in 2016 called 'Friends for Christmas.'\n\nIn 2016, she had her own residency show in Las Vegas and two years later in 2018, she released the single 'Love Is a Gift' with fellow Aussie Delta Goodrem - who would later perform a string of her biggest hits at her memorial service in February 2023.\n\nJudging from her Instagram feed, Olivia Newton-John then performed at charity events and even had the odd TV appearance as a judge on RuPaul's Drag Race and Dancing With The Stars.\n\nThen and now: See your favourite artists through the years\n\nNow read:\n\nELO through the years: How the Electric Light Orchestra has changed over time\n\nJeff Lynne's amazing career: From fronting ELO to solo success\n\n12 of the best Elton John songs of all time\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
