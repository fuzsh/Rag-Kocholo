        "text": "Australian pop music icon Olivia Newton-John has passed away. The singer and actor, who starred in films including Grease and Xanadu, was 73.\n\nHer death was confirmed by Newton-John’s husband John Easterling, in a post to the singer’s official social media accounts.\n\nNewton-John passed away peacefully at her ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends, Easterling said.\n\n“We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time,” the statement said.\n\nNewton-John was born in 1948 in Cambridge, in the United Kingdom. Her family emigrated to Melbourne when she was six before she emerged as a rising pop star as a teenager.\n\nAfter achieving worldwide fame, she was considered one of Australia’s greatest cultural assets.\n\nAt just 14, Newton-John formed girl group Sol Four and began appearing on television variety shows. An appearance on The Go! Show would prove a pivotal moment: she met singer Pat Carroll and producer John Farrar.\n\nIn 1965, she won a talent contest on Sing, Sing, Sing, hosted by Johnny O’Keefe, and a year later used the prize – a trip to the UK – to travel. There, she and Carroll sang together and Newton-John’s career properly took off.\n\nNewton-John’s musical career included the chart-topper I Honestly Love You, released the same year as her 1974 performance at the Eurovision Song Contest, where she finished fourth behind Swedish supergroup ABBA.\n\nLoading\n\nIn 1978, she delivered a performance that would remain central to her fame for the rest of her life: she played Sandy Olsson opposite John Travolta as Danny Zuko in the film adaptation of the Broadway smash hit Grease.\n\nThe film, including signature duets of Summer Nights and You’re the One That I Want with Travolta, remains one of the most successful films of all time, earning more than a third of a billion dollars at the US box office.\n\nIn the film, which co-starred Stockard Channing and Didi Conn, Newton-John played an Australian schoolgirl transplanted into Rydell High School in America.\n\nFor Newton-John and Travolta the film laid the foundation of a lifelong friendship, the pair intermittently reuniting on concert stages and at special events to perform the movie’s signature songs.\n\nTravolta was among the first to pay tribute to Newton-John publicly.\n\n“My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better,” Travolta wrote in a post to his Instagram account.\n\n“Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again. Yours from the moment I saw you and forever. Your Danny, your John.”\n\nLoading\n\nAs the news of Newton-John’s death broke early in the Los Angeles afternoon, other tributes followed.\n\nActor Jane Lynch, who sang Physical with Newton-John in an episode of Glee, wrote simply: “ONJ. Angel.”\n\nDirector James Gunn, who bought her home in Malibu years ago, described her as “my first real crush as a kid”.\n\n“Really sad to hear about the passing of Olivia Newton-John,” he wrote on his Twitter account. “I loved Grease and her music. May she rest in peace.”\n\nLater, Newton-John evolved musically with more emotionally complex work, such as the albums Warm and Tender and Stronger Than Before.\n\nShe also shifted her focus to healing and wellbeing, following a much-publicised battle with cancer, and started the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund.\n\nIn the statement posted to her official Facebook account, Newton-John’s family has asked that donations be made in her memory to the fund.\n\nNewton-John received an OBE in 1979, and in 2019 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, though the title Dame Olivia did not fall into everyday usage.\n\nShe was admitted to the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame in 2002; in 2019 she was made a Companion of the Order of Australia.\n\nNewton-John was married twice; first to actor Matt Lattanzi in 1984, who she met on the set of the film Xanadu. The couple had a daughter, Chloe, in 1986 and divorced amicably in 1995.\n\nIn 2008, Newton-John married businessman John Easterling in an Incan spiritual ceremony. The couple bought a home on Jupiter Island, Florida, but never moved there. They later bought a horse ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley, outside Santa Barbara.\n\nNewton-John is survived by Easterling, daughter Chloe Lattanzi, sister Sarah Newton-John and brother Toby Newton-John."
