        "text": "OLIVIA'S BIOGRAPHY\n\nClick here to go to the end of this page\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge, England on September 26th 1948; her family moved t o Australia when she was 5. Her mother was German, daughter of the physicist Max Born, her father was Welsh, a professor of German at Cambridge and Melbourne. Despite the academic background, early on Olivia showed a interest in singing, forming a band called the Sol Four with some school friends, and later on singing at her brother-in-law's coffee bar in Australia. She also starred in a movie \"Funny Things Happen Down Under\" which was forgettable apart from some early promise shown in Olivia's delightful rendition of \"Christmas Down Under\".\n\nA talent contest hosted by the Australian Johnny O'Keefe offered Olivia the price of a trip to England, and she took this up in 1965. Her first introduction to making records was a one-off single deal with Decca records. The single, Till You Say You'll Be Mine/For Ever, is extremely rare though these two songs were available (Oct 1994) on the British compilation CD Pop Inside the 60's.\n\nEngland did not make Olivia entirely happy - she missed Australia and her then boyfriend, Ian Turpie. In one interview she reports how she attempted to book her return flight without telling her mother, who had accompanied her to the UK. Fortunately for Olivia's fans and her future career her mother was not having her daughter waste the opportunity to broaden her horizons and Olivia's plans were thwarted.\n\nThings improved when Pat Carroll, a fellow Australian, arrived in the UK. Dreaming of stardom the two girls played pubs and clubs as the vocal duo imaginatively called \"Pat and Olivia\". In 1968 Bruce Welch of the Shadows fell for Olivia they became engaged, something which was not entirely without problems as he was married at the time...\n\nPat's visa ran out in December 1969 and she returned home. For Olivia, movie stardom beckoned as she was invited to join the band Toomorrow, which was to be Britain's answer to the Monkees. This manufactured group issued an eponymous album in 1970 to go with the film or the same name, but the public were not impressed and the movie closed quickly, leaving Olivia to concentrate on her solo music career.\n\nOlivia was invited to be the resident star for Cliff Richard's highly successful TV show in 1972, and she was a regular live performer in London.\n\nThe early Seventies was a prolific period for Olivia - her association with Cliff Richard and the Shadows brought her music to a wide audience, and she released the albums Olivia Newton-John(1971), and Olivia(1972), Music Makes My Day(1973).\n\nBruce Welch arranged Olivia's first hit single, a cover of Bob Dylan's If Not For You. This single was Olivia's first taste of success in America, something she was to experience a lot more of in the next few years.\n\nOlivia reached a turning point in her career with the release of Let Me Be There which charted at #6 in America. No longer engaged to Bruce Welch, John Farrar, another member of the Shadows, took up songwriting and arrangement for her and this was a successful team which was soon to take the United States by storm. John Farrar has known Olivia from the early days and he later married Pat Carroll, Olivia's erstwhile singing partner and future business partner.\n\nWhile holidaying in the 1974 in the South of France Olivia met Lee Kramer, who had a successful import/export business. The romance developed, and Lee was Olivia's boyfriend and manager for much of the rest of the decade.\n\nJust before she moved to the United States to build on her burgeoning success there, Olivia represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974. Both song and Olivia's costume on the night were selected by a poll of TV viewers, and the whole mess showed just what was wrong with pop artistic taste. A truly awful oompah-oompah song, Long Live Love was chosen, together with a long flowing baby-blue dress for the actual performance.\n\nAmerica beckoned and Olivia left England in 1975 to a rapturous welcome for her next album \"Have You Never Been Mellow\". The title song charted at #1 and her next single from the album, Please Mr. Please, reached #3. This was the start of a roll which continued throughout the 70s with a string of gold albums in the US. Olivia was to become a regular on shows like the Midnight Special, and in 1976 she had her own TV special by ABC - A Very Special Olivia Newton-John.\n\nHer US audience had loved her for her soft and delicate delivery of ballads and country songs, and she treated them to a string of albums beautifully sung - Clearly Love, Come On over, Don't Stop Believin', and Making a Good Thing Better. She toured the United States with the album Clearly Love.\n\nOlivia captured hearts in Japan with her singing as well as in the US - she toured Japan in 1976 with the album Don't Stop Believin'. Japanese listeners had loved her ever since her performance in the 1971 Tokyo Music Fair, and the 1976 concert was released as a live album in Japan titled \"Love Performance\". She won a string of Grammy's for her work, and settled in Malibu, near Los Angeles, with a ranch in the mountains.\n\nThere she fulfilled a childhood ambition, keeping a number of dogs and horses on the property. As a child, she had not been able to keep many pets despite her love of animals. Her concern for animal welfare spilled over into her professional life when she refused to go to Japan until they amended tuna fishing practices to reduce the needless slaughter of dolphins in the nets.\n\nMusically, it seemed as if Olivia was at the peak of her career, gathering awards effortlessly. In Los Angeles, a producer was looking for a female lead to play opposite John Travolta in his forthcoming movie adaptation of the stage musical Grease. Olivia was not totally sure about playing in another movie and requested a screen test after she was asked to star. The scene was the drive-in and Olivia wowed Allan Carr. Released in June 1978, Grease went on to become one of the biggest selling musicals of all time and the soundtrack album stormed the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Her album, Totally Hot, also released in 1978 showed a new musical direction away from her early ballads to more upbeat rock. The album was a great success and Olivia toured America, Japan and Europe with it.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult to follow up such a huge success, and Olivia's next movie, Xanadu(1980), received a panning from the critics and did not draw the public into the cinema. However, the soundtrack was a roaring success, with Olivia's song Magic topping the US charts, and the title song, a duet with ELO, also selling well.. The movie has since become something of a cult classic, with a small but dedicated following.\n\nThe movie did have a personal spin-off for Olivia - she met her future husband, Matt Lattanzi, who was a dancer on the set of Xanadu.\n\nIn 1981 Olivia released the album Physical. The million-selling title track took up residence at #1 on the US charts for weeks - the second-longest run in the top spot. She had some trepidation about how her fans would like the new direction but she needn't have worried - they loved it!\n\nWith the aerobic feel of the title track and accompanying video, Olivia's early 80's trademark was the short cropped hair and headband. With the album there was also a full-length video, which was unusual at the time when videos were normally just for individual songs. The album was so successful that when Olivia toured with it the next year she played all over America to sell-out audiences.\n\nAfter reaching the pinnacle of her career with Physical, Olivia wanted to take things easier. She was starting to think about other directions - one of them was starting a store with Australian novelties, which was later to turn into the \"Koala Blue\" fashion chain.\n\nIn an attempt to reproduce the box-office magic of \"Grease\", Olivia was cast with John Travolta in the movie Two of Kind. In interviews at the time Olivia said that this was her first opportunity to star in a non-musical movie, but the result was not a cinematic success. Once again, however, the soundtrack, sold quite well with some strong tracks form Olivia and a pleasant duet with John Travolta.\n\nOlivia married her young live-in boyfriend Matt Lattanzi, around Christmas 1984, after they had lived together for four years. The couple enjoyed a fairytale honeymoon in Paris.\n\nHer next change in musical direction was the sultry risque' approach of Soulkiss it was not really a musical success. Bizarrely, the video-gram was shot when Olivia was pregnant with daughter Chloe - trying not to show this constrained the artistic freedom of the director somewhat. The album, which featured Olivia in tight riding pants and boots holding a crop on the back cover, stretched things further than the public found credible.\n\nChloe was born early 1986, and this marked a hiatus in Olivia's music. The period 1986 to 1992 was a lean period in her entertainment career, as she dedicated herself to motherhood, and to developing her business venture, the Koala Blue chain of stores.\n\nOlivia transformed her original idea for Australian specialty store into a fashion chain. This enterprise was established with fellow-Australian, Pat Farrar. Koala Blue was to be a more family-friendly alternative to an intensive singing career, but it did not last the late '80s/early'90s recession. Olivia chose to expand the franchise chain just as consumers were reining in there expenditure on non-essentials, and the company filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy amid some recriminations.\n\nMusic was not totally neglected - in 1988, Olivia brought out The Rumour, with the title track penned by Elton John. 1988 was also the year of the Australian Bicentennial, and Olivia made a video-gram for The Rumour, in which she performed the songs in some stunning Australian settings. The Australian version of the album features the song It's Always Australia For Me which is absent from the international versions.\n\nWarm and Tender, released in 1989, was not really aimed for the mainstream pop market. An album of children's songs and lullabies, this was really meant for Chloe. It is Olivia's first real musical indulgence, which was released on the Geffen label after MCA refused to run it.\n\nGeffen released Back to Basics, The Essential Collection in 1992. This was to be Olivia's return to what she did best, a retrospective over her career but featuring four new songs, which Olivia promoted actively, and she was rehearsing to go on tour with the album in the late summer.\n\nThe bombshell came on July 2 - Olivia Newton-John had breast cancer. She was talked to hospital and operated on, and then had to undergo a period of chemotherapy. In February the next year she got the all-clear, and went to Australia to recuperate.\n\nGaia, One Womans Journey, an intensely personal and upbeat album, was one of the fruits of Olivia's time in Australia out of the limelight. The album was not release in the US but was widely issued on independent labels elsewhere. Olivia chose to talk about her experiences with breast cancer, so that other women in a similar position could see that survival was possible, and early detection was important.\n\nAfter her recovery, there were reports of difficulty in Olivia's marriage, which came to a head in 1995 with the announcement that Olivia and husband Matt Lattanzi, were to go their separate ways and eventually divorce. For the next two years Olivia's career was a medley of different directions, with her participating in beauty ads for Home Shopping, a bit part in a US sitcom, an Australian wildlife show title Human Nature, appearing in an Aussie TV series Snowy River and acting in the movie It's My Party directed by Grease director Randal Kleiser.\n\nBack With a Heart released in May 1998, found Olivia in fine form with an excellent mix of pop and country. Teaming up with Cliff Richard in her first live performance for many years, Australian audiences were treated to Cliff and Olivia live in February and March 1998. The end of 1998 saw Olivia with two Austrailians for the Main Event Tour, a sellout show with extra dates added by popular demand.\n\nIt was America's turn in 1999 - starting on New Years Eve 98/99 with a mini-tour Olivia treated audiences to a set of her greatest hits, followed by a much larger tour of the United States in the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, a new look and a new direction called with an acting role in Del Shores independent production of the stage play Sordid Lives.\n\nA new millennium brought a 14-date American tour in the spring/early summer with a new line-up of songs from her Greatest Hits. The Fall of 2000 saw Olivia singing to her largest audience yet - performing a duet with Australian superstar John Farnham at the opening Ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games.\n\n2001 brings a tour of the United States, a new TV movie with daughter Chloe and the release of an anniversary box set of hits, rarities and new songs to celebrate 30 years of hits!\n\nClick here to go to the top of this page"
