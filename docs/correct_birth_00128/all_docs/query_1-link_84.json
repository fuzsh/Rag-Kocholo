She is also survived by her daughter, Chloe Lattanzi, 36.\n\n“Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer,” Easterling wrote. “Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer.” Newton-John established the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund in 2020 to help sponsor global research into plant medicine for cancer, educating patients and their caregivers about kinder options for treating cancer."
