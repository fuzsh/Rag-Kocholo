        "text": "Biography\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born on September 26, 1948 in Cambridge, England. She was raised in Melbourne, Australia, where her father was the headmaster of Ormond College (her grandfather Max Born won the Nobel Prize for physics). With four Grammys, Newton-John has had a successful musical career. Topping the charts in the genres of pop, country, and adult contemporary.\n\nAs a country singer, her first five charting singles all went Top Ten in the U.S.; as a pop singer, she had no less than 15 Top Ten hits, including five number one singles, highlighted by “Physical,” which spent ten weeks at number one in 1981-1982. Newton-John’s sweet voice suited both country-pop and soft rock perfectly, which is what kept her at the top of the charts until the mid-‘80s."
