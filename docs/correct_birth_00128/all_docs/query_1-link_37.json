I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again.\n\n“Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever! Your Danny, your John!”\n\nThe soundtrack to Grease is one of the world’s best-selling albums of recorded music and features the two hit duets from Dame Olivia and Travolta: Summer Nights and You’re The One That I Want.\n\nThe latter also ranks as one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nAside from her hit role in the film, Dame Olivia is also a multi-platinum selling artist, with two singles and two albums having earned the certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nDame Olivia also represented the UK in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Long Live Love.\n\nShe finished fourth in the competition, held in Brighton, losing out to Abba, with their hit song Waterloo.\n\nIn a statement posted to Instagram, her husband John Easterling wrote: “We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time.\n\nDame Olivia’s daughter Chloe Lattanzi paid tribute to her mother with a selection of images on Instagram.\n\nThe post included pictures of Ms Lattanzi as a baby as well as more showing the pair appearing to give interviews together.\n\nAside from her showbusiness career, Dame Olivia became became a prominent breast cancer campaigner, after being given the first of three cancer diagnoses in 1992.\n\nFollowing her initial battle with the disease, she had a partial mastectomy and reconstruction.\n\nShe remained cancer-free until a recurrence in 2013, but revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer for the third time in three decades in September 2018.\n\nAt the time, she told Australian news programme Sunday Night that doctors had found a tumour in her lower back in 2017.\n\nThe singer said she was treating the illness “naturally” and was using cannabis oil made from marijuana her husband grows in California to alleviate the pain.\n\n“Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer,” Mr Easterling said in his Instagram post.\n\n“Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer.”\n\nMr Easterling added that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Dame Olivia’s foundation.\n\nDame Olivia was born in Cambridge, England, to Welshman Professor Brin Newton-John and his German-born wife Irene, who was the daughter of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Max Born.\n\nThe youngest of three children, she moved with her family to Melbourne when she was five.\n\nUpon being made a Dame in the 2019 New Year she told of her pride in her British ancestry, after being recognised for her services to charity, to cancer research and to entertainment.\n\n“I am extremely excited, honoured and grateful beyond words to be included with such an esteemed group of women who have received this distinguished award before me,” she said.\n\n“Thank you to the prime minister and the main honours committee for recommending me, and of course Her Majesty the Queen for graciously approving me as Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n“As a girl born in Cambridge, I am very proud of my British ancestry and so appreciative to be recognised in this way by the United Kingdom.”\n\nShe is survived by her husband as well as her daughter."
