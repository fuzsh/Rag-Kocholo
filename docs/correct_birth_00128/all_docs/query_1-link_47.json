        "text": "Olivia Newton-John was an Australian singer-songwriter and actress, who won four Grammy Awards in her career. She was one of the biggest pop stars of the 1970s, and is remembered for the blockbuster movie Grease. She was also an entrepreneur and activist for environmental and animal rights issues. She also advocated for health awareness and was involved with various charities as well. Born in England, she initially performed in clubs and TV shows. She reached stardom after her Grammy Award-winning hits I Honestly Love You and Physical. She sold around 100 million records worldwide, and was one of the world’s best-selling artists of all time. Her acting career began with a supporting role in Funny Things Happen Down Under. Years later, she played the lead role in the musical film Grease. The film’s soundtrack is one of the most successful ones in history. In 1992, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went into remission following the treatment and then suffered a relapse in 2017. She was an advocate for breast cancer awareness and raised a significant amount of funds to establish the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne. She died of breast cancer on August 8, 2022."
