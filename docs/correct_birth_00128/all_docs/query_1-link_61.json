        "text": "OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN will be having a state memorial in her hometown of Melbourne.\n\nNewton-John’s niece Tottie Goldsmith revealed to the Today Show on August 10, the family had accepted an offer from the Victorian Government. But mentioned the Australian icon will be laid to rest at her ranch in Southern California.\n\nThis follows news of Newton-John’s death on August 8, following a 30-year battle with breast cancer. She was 73 years old.\n\n“She will be on the ranch. She will be (with) her horses and her dogs and her chickens and her daughter and her husband. So, we’ll be doing a state memorial,” Goldsmith told the breakfast television show.\n\nGoldsmith, who called Newton-John “more than a mother” during an interview for A Current Affair, said she and her brother Brett were to meet with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews later that day.\n\nGoldsmith also said she’s been in regular touch with Newton-John’s daughter Chloe Lattanzi — who she called “really strong.” She also also revealed she FaceTimed with Newton-John just before she passed away.\n\n“She was on her way out. So, it was me speaking to her and I asked John if I could put the phone to her ear. He FaceTimed, which was bittersweet, because it was very hard seeing her that way but it was a gift. Because, um, her … Her mouth moved and so I think she was telling me that she could hear me.”\n\nLattanzi also took to Instagram to honour her “life giver, my teacher, my mama” with an emotional music video of her singing with Newton-John on their ranch.\n\n“You are my lighthouse mama. My safe place. My heart space. It has been my honor and continues to be my honor to be your baby and best friend. You are an angel on earth and everyone touched by you has been blessed. I love you forever my life giver, my teacher, my mama.”\n\nOn Monday, Newton-John’s husband John Easterling confirmed the singer/actress had “passed away peacefully” via a statement posted to Newton-John’s social media accounts.\n\n“Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the beloved Grease star’s brave and pioneering advocacy in cancer awareness and research. Newton-John was one of the first Hollywood celebrities to open up about their health issues when she revealed her first breast cancer diagnosis in 1992.\n\nThis later led to the creation of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre in Melbourne.\n\n“Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer. Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that any donations be made in her memory to the @onjfoundation.”\n\nWhile a four-time Grammy winner with a slew of acting credits, Newton-John is best known for playing the shy and sweet high-schooler, Sandy, in the hit movie-musical Grease opposite John Travolta.\n\nThe role — with which she was offered by the film’s producer after meeting at dinner party — saw Newton-John nominated for a Golden Globe. Originally, the Cambridge, England born actress wasn’t convinced she could play a student at 29 years old. The role was also altered to accommodate her Australian accent.\n\nGrease was the biggest box-office hit during its release in 1978 with its soundtrack spending 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the US. Still to this day, it remains a cherished movie-musical.\n\nJust two years later, Newton-John starred in another movie-musical, Xanadu, before appearing alongside Travolta again in 1983’s Two of a Kind.\n\nFollowing Newton-John’s first cancer diagnosis, she had a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy and breast reconstruction. Then in May 2017, Newton-John announced her breast cancer returned and had metastasized to the sacrum. The Herald Sun also revealed a secondary infection in hospital led to her worsening condition.\n\nTravolta, who has remained good friends with Newton-John since Grease — even appearing at a reunion sing-a-long special in 2019 — shared an emotional tribute to Instagram following news of her death.\n\nThe 68-year-old actor, who also lost his wife Kelly Preston to breast cancer in 2020, wrote that Newton-John “made all of our lives so much better.”\n\n“My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much,” he began.\n\n“We will see you down the road and we will all be together again. Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever!\n\nYour Danny, your John!”\n\nNewton-John is survived by her husband John Easterling; daughter Chloe Lattanzi; sister Sarah Newton-John; brother Toby Newton-John; nieces and nephews Tottie, Fiona and Brett Goldsmith; Emerson, Charlie, Zac, Jeremy, Randall, and Pierz Newton-John; Jude Newton-Stock, Layla Lee; Kira and Tasha Edelstein; and Brin and Valerie Hall."
