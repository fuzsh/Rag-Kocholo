        "text": "Moving to Australia & Starting Her Career\n\nThey emigrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1954 when Olivia Newton-John was only six years old. Performing has always been in Newton-John’s blood. Soon after she and her family moved to Melbourne, she began performing with the New Idea Youth Show Band under the stage name ‘Olivia Newton-John’ at age 10. While that didn’t last too long, she went on to form a group called “Sol Four” with some of her classmates when she was only 14. At the same time, she started acting and performing as “Lovely Livvy” for HSV-7’s The Happy Show, per Biography.\n\n‘The Olivia Newton-John Band’ & ‘Pat and Olivia’\n\nIn the late 1960s, Newton-John moved back to the UK to work with her band “The Olivia Newton-John Band.” While that was short-lived, she went on to co-create a singing duo with fellow performer Pat Carroll. For a few years, the two toured at nightclubs, trying to make a name for themselves as the lovable singing duo named “Pat and Olivia.” However, in the mid-1970s, Carroll’s visa expired, leaving Newton-John to continue her solo singing career in the UK, per her website.\n\nGrammy Winning Powerhouse\n\nIn the early 1970s, Olivia Newton-John released her first solo album on vinyl called “Let Me Be Your Angel.” This led to her whopping success, earning four Grammys throughout her career. She was nominated 10 times, winning “Best Female Country Vocal Performance” for “Let Me Be There” in 1973, Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for “I Honestly Love You” in 1975, and “Video of the Year” for “Physical” in 1983.\n\nShe Almost Didn’t Play Sandy in ‘Grease’\n\nTo date, Olivia Newton-John’s most notable character was when she starred as plucky girl-next-door Sandy in the classic musical Grease. It shot her into superstardom, and she always looked back on it fondly. However, in a previous interview with the Telegraph, she revealed she almost didn’t take the role.\n\nAt 30 years old, she thought she was “too old” to play the high schooler, but her buddy and co-star John Travolta was actually the one to convince her. “John was charming and really wanted me to do [the movie],” she said. “That was one of the deciding factors.”\n\nOscar & Golden Globe Nominee\n\nAlong with an impressive singing career, she earned an Oscar nomination and two Golden Globe nominations. However, her Oscar nomination was for Best Music, Original Song by John Farrar for Hopelessly Devoted To You in 1978. Her Golden Globe nominations were both from 1978, for her work in Grease. She was nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and co-nominated for Best Original Song in a Motion Picture by John Farrar for the song “You’re The One That I Want.”\n\nShe Loved Her “Strong” Daughter Chloe\n\nWhile they had an up-and-down relationship growing up, Olivia Newton-John and her daughter Chloe Lattanzi grew super close when Lattanzi grew up. Lattanzi faced a lot of personal struggles, and Newton-John has been there for her, sharing how proud she is of her “strong” daughter. She previously told People in 2016, “We have a great relationship now.”\n\nBusinesswoman, Author, & Much More\n\nAlong with being an award-winning singer and actor, Olivia Newton-John went down on many different business ventures, per her website. She was an entrepreneur, author, and activist. Back in the 1980s, she opened the store Koala Blue, a store that was “all Australian,” later also releasing wine by the same name. As for her writing career, she released her iconic memoir in 2019 called Don’t Stop Believin.’\n\nDon't Stop Believin' by Olivia Newton-John\n\n$14.99 $16.99 12% Off\n\non Amazon.com\n\nHer Loving Second Marriage\n\nNewton-John married her second husband, John Easterling, the founder and president of the Amazon Herb Company, in the summer of 2008. They remained happily together until her death in 2022. They met through mutual friends during an environmental show, bumping into each other often at different charity functions. However, Easterling got into a car wreck, later living with Newton to recover from the accident. Then they fell in love on a trip to Peru, per Amomoma. How odd and romantic!\n\nHer Grueling Cancer Journey & The Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre\n\nIf there’s one thing you can’t deny, it’s that Olivia Newton-John was a badass. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, getting a partial mastectomy, and underwent chemotherapy. However, she did recover but was sadly diagnosed again in 2017. But she never stopped fighting. She became a huge advocate for cancer research, later opening The Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in 2008, which is now one of the biggest cancer care centers in the world, per her website.\n\nShe & John Travolta Remained Best Friends\n\nAfter working together on the iconic classic Grease, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta remained best friends. “[In tough times] John always reaches out to me,” she told People at Grease’s 40th Year Reunion. “When you share that kind of meteoric success — and nothing has been able to exceed it — you share a bond. I’ve been through her having a child, getting divorced, losing her sister. She’s been through my getting married, having children. It’s wonderful and full of shared memories.”"
