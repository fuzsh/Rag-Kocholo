        "text": "Dame Olivia Newton-John AC DBE (26 September 1948 – 8 August 2022) was a British-born Australian singer, actress, and activist. She was a four-time Grammy Award winner whose music career included five number-one hits and another ten top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and two number-one albums on the Billboard 200; \"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\" (1974) and Have You Never Been Mellow (1975). Eleven of her singles (including two Platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two Platinum and four 2× Platinum) have been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With global sales of more than 100 million records, Newton-John is one of the best-selling music artists from the second half of the 20th century to the present.\n\nIn 1978, Olivia Newton-John starred in the musical film Grease, whose soundtrack remains one of the world's best-selling albums of all time. It features two major hit duets with co-star John Travolta: \"You're the One That I Want\" – which is one of the best-selling singles of all time – and \"Summer Nights\". Her signature solo recordings include the Record of the Year Grammy winner \"I Honestly Love You\" (1974) and \"Physical\" (1981) – Billboard Hot 100 highest-ranking single of the 1980s. Other hit singles include \"If Not for You\" and \"Banks of the Ohio\" (both 1971), \"Let Me Be There\" (1973), \"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\" (1974), \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" (1975), \"Sam\" (1977), \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" (1978; also from Grease), \"A Little More Love\" (1978), and from the 1980 film Xanadu, \"Magic\" and \"Xanadu\" (with Electric Light Orchestra). In 1983, Newton-John and Travola reunited for the comedy fantasy, Two of a Kind. The film was not a success but Newton-John scored a hit single from its soundtrack, \"Twist of Fate\" and also recorded another duet with Travolta for the film. A few years before her death, she and Travola reunited once again to record a Christmas album together.\n\nOlivia Newton-John was an activist for environmental and animal rights causes, and advocated for breast cancer research, a condition she fought during the last 20 years of her life."
