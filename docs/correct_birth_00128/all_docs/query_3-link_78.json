        "text": "The passing of some celebrities strikes home personally. For me, Dame Olivia Newton-John is one of them.\n\nI’d been a fan of hers ever since 1971, when, as a University of Georgia student, I was browsing at Barnett’s Newsstand in Athens, looking at a copy of Billboard. In it was an ad for her new single “If Not for You,” a Bob Dylan song that George Harrison had covered on the previous fall’s “All Things Must Pass” album.\n\nI liked her version of the tune, which I’d heard on the radio, and the picture of the winsome young singer in Billboard caught my eye, too. I wasn’t alone in that regard. When visiting a friend who was working as a part-time DJ at one of the local Top 40 radio stations, I noticed that picture of Olivia also was pinned up on the bulletin board in the studio.\n\nI continued to listen to Olivia’s music, as she flirted with pop-country, becoming a regular on the C&W charts for a while. I remember that caused some consternation in Nashville, because, after all, she was from Australia!\n\nActually, although her family had emigrated to Australia, and that’s where Lovely Livvy, as she was known, first started performing, she’d been born in Britain, of Welsh descent. Being half-Welsh myself, that was another point in her favor, as far as I was concerned.\n\nI remained a fan and, after I’d started working for The Atlanta Constitution, I began doing a Saturday music column. The opportunity came to do a phone interview with Olivia, and I jumped at the chance; we had a delightful chat.\n\nAfter the column was published, the managing editor called me into his office. It turned out, that he also was a fan of Olivia.\n\nAt that point, I was working as a copy editor, and doing the music writing on the side as a freebie. The boss decided to make the music column a part of my job, giving me one day a week to work on it. Then, a year or so later, he made me a full-time entertainment reporter, covering music.\n\nIn that regard, my wife Leslie and I had the chance to talk with Olivia in person, at a reception held in the hotel across from Atlanta’s Fox Theatre, after she had done a concert there. She was as personable and chatty as she’d been on the phone. She told us she was using Atlanta as a base for a few days, commuting to concerts in the South.\n\nOf course, Olivia went on to star with John Travolta in the film version of the Broadway musical “Grease,” which made her one of the biggest female stars of the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nOver the next few years, I interviewed her on several occasions. One was a brief chat at some sort of celebration of a radio station’s anniversary.\n\nThen, when she was promoting her “Physical” album, I had the chance to sit down with her in a studio at another radio station, for an in-depth conversation of about an hour.\n\nClad all in white, with her frosted hair newly cut short, I noticed that, at age 33, she had freckles and laugh lines around her big blue eyes. She sipped apple juice during the interview and was even willing to discuss The Rumor — a widely circulated urban myth that she’d told Johnny Carson on the “Tonight Show” that she was gay; she had not.\n\nAfter we’d finished, her record label president and a couple of radio station bigwigs were going to take her out to eat. I wasn’t supposed to be included, but Olivia turned to me and said, “Bill, would you like to come?”\n\nSo, we set out for Mary Mac’s, a Midtown meat-and-three place. But, when she learned we’d have to stand in line, Olivia asked for something a bit more private. We wound up in the restaurant at a downtown hotel, where I sat next to her for a leisurely lunch.\n\nAgain, she came across as very down-to-earth, considerate and interested in what others had to say.\n\nA lasting image of Olivia in my mind is from a later visit to Atlanta, where she performed a concert that I covered at the old Omni arena. After the show was over, she came back out and proceeded to sit on the edge of the stage for the better part of an hour, signing autographs for concertgoers.\n\nNot your usual star, that’s for sure.\n\nIn recent years, of course, Olivia primarily was known for working tirelessly in her very public battle against breast cancer, the disease that finally claimed her after 30 years.\n\nShe was, hands down, one of the nicest celebrities I ever met. How much of an impression did she make on me?\n\nShe’s one of the reasons our daughter is named Olivia."
