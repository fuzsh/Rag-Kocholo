        "text": "Career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAppearances on British singer Cliff Richard’s television show in the early 1970s helped Newton-John launch her solo career. With a folk-pop style, she reached the British Top Ten chart in 1971 with an arrangement of Bob Dylan’s “If Not for You.” Turning to country tunes, Newton-John fared well on the U.S. country and pop charts with “Let Me Be There,” “If You Love Me, Let Me Know,” and “Please Mr. Please.” In 1973 she won a Grammy Award for best female country vocal performance, and her crossover tunes earned her various other awards from the Country Music Association. Newton-John went on to win a Grammy Award in 1974 as best pop female vocalist for “I Honestly Love You,” which also was chosen as record of the year.\n\nIn 1978 Newton-John starred opposite American actor and singer John Travolta in Grease, a teenage romance set in the 1950s. Its soundtrack, featuring the duet “You’re the One That I Want,” was a best seller. Newton-John turned to rock songs for the albums Totally Hot (1978) and Physical (1981). She won the 1982 Grammy Award for best video for Olivia Physical, a compilation of several of her song videos from Physical and other albums. Her next two films, Xanadu (1980) and Two of a Kind (1983), were not well received by critics, though the first produced a platinum soundtrack.\n\nOver the next decade Newton-John devoted much of her time to personal activities. She married American actor Matt Lattanzi in 1984 (they later divorced) and became a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme. Warm and Tender (1989), an album dedicated to her daughter, featured soothing music for infants as well as inserts on ways to protect the environment.\n\nIn the 1990s Newton-John appeared in several made-for-television Christmas movies. She also coauthored the children’s book A Pig Tale (1993). Gaia: One Woman’s Journey, an album released in Australia in 1994, featured songs written by Newton-John about the environment and about her battle with breast cancer. In 1998 she released Back with a Heart, which featured songs reminiscent of her country-pop days.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

(2), which was released in 2002, and A Celebration in Song (2008) contain duets with musicians such as New Zealand–born Australian country singer Keith Urban and American pop-rock singer Richard Marx. The albums Stronger than Before (2005) and Grace and Gratitude (2006) include inspirational and meditative songs. LIV ON (2016) deals with loss and healing. Newton-John also released several Christmas albums, including This Christmas (2012) with Travolta and Friends for Christmas (2016) with British-born Australian singer John Farnham. From 2014 to 2016 she performed regularly in Las Vegas. She occasionally appeared in movies and on television shows, including the series Sordid Lives (2008).\n\nPhilanthropy and honours\n\nNewton-John campaigned for innovative cancer research and treatment methods after her initial cancer diagnosis in 1992. She helped to establish the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre at Austin Hospital near Melbourne, Victoria, in 2012. Proceeds from her book Livwise: Easy Recipes for a Healthy, Happy Life (2011) helped to fund the centre. Money raised from sales of several of her albums as well as of her personal items also went to cancer research. She founded the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund charity in 2020 to sponsor research into plant-based treatments for cancer.\n\nFor her entertainment and charity work Newton-John was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year’s Honours and was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year’s Honours. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2006 and was elevated to a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2019.\n\nIn 2017 Newton-John announced that her breast cancer had returned and had spread to her back. She released an autobiography, Don’t Stop Believin’, in 2018, and she made her last public appearance in February 2020, at an event for Fire Fight Australia. Window in the Wall, a duet recorded with her daughter, was released in 2021 and was Newton-John’s final song."
