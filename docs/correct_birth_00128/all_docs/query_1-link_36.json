        "text": "At the age of 73, entertainer Olivia Newton-John passed away at her Southern California ranch on August 8. As noted via Facebook, she was surrounded by her family and friends.\n\nHer three-decade-long struggle with breast cancer -- including her \"pioneering experience with plant medicine\" -- will inspire future work for her Olivia Newton-John Foundation. Therefore, instead of flowers to honor her life, her family has opted that donations be made in her memory to the fund.\n\nNewton-John's connection to Music City expands as far back as rural Australians have connected with country music.\n\nBy 22, Newton-John was a well-traveled youth TV performer throughout Europe. After a childhood spent in Melbourne, Australia, her father took a position as a German professor and master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. She was \"discovered\" by American pop and rock promoter Don Kirshner. One year later, in 1971, she released \"If Not for You,\" her debut solo album.\n\nMore: Olivia Newton-John, beloved as Sandy in 'Grease,' dies at 73 after breast cancer battle\n\nCountry music's easy-listening vibes are ideally melded with post-hippie-era rock and pop's melodic, relaxed stylings. Two years later, in 1973, she released a cover of rural pop meets guitar-driven, countrified easy-listening icon John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\"\n\nIt was a No. 1 Record World and Cash Box hit for the former while reaching No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. For Newton-John, it opened a lane to superstardom.\n\nHer follow-up to \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" was the 1973-released \"Let Me Be There.\" It reached the top ten on the Adult Contemporary, country, and pop charts. That success spurred her to win a GRAMMY for Best Country Female Performer and the Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist in the same year.\n\nJohn toed the line between album-oriented rock favorites of that period like Helen Reddy and a slew of emerging and established country performers, including Lynn Anderson, Loretta Lynn, Barbara Mandrell, Anne Murray, Dolly Parton, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette. Though lacking the country legitimacy of the mentioned grouping, her movie-star appeal and ultra-polished performance style greatly benefitted her rise to acclaim.\n\nIn a 1998 Associated Press interview, she recalls, \"When I wanted to make an album, I wondered where I might fit in. Country [music] seemed the obvious choice. \"Dolly (Parton) and Loretta (Lynn) and others [were] so open and welcoming.\"\n\nNotably, in April 1975, Dolly Parton's sister Stella cut the song \"Ode to Olivia\" in response to the criticism the Australian vocalist was receiving for not holding entirely faithful to the roots of country music. In response to Newton-John's 1973 success, artists including Bill Anderson, George Jones, Mandrell, Parton, Hank Snow, Mel Tillis, Porter Wagoner, Wynette, and Faron Young formed the Association of Country Entertainers (ACE), dedicated to \"preserving and recognizing the basic and traditional country singers.\"\n\nThe Parton sisters even argued about Newton-John's role in the genre. In Olivia Newton-John's 2011-released biography \"Olivia: The Biography of Olivia Newton-John,\" Stella adds the following:\n\n\"I released [\"Ode to Olivia\"] because I was embarrassed for all my country cousins and sisters here in town [Nashville]. I was trying to apologize to her [Newton-John] ... I thought it was embarrassing that they got so irate that they had gone to such trouble ... I never will forget I played that song [\"Ode to Olivia\"] in the studio for [my sister] Dolly and she said, 'Oh Lord, Stella, don't let Porter hear that,' I said, 'Screw Porter, I don't care what he thinks.'... They [ACE] just got all ticked off because none of them won that year.\"\n\nDiplomatically, regarding the dust-up, Newton-John states in the same book, \"It's all music. Country music has a style and I love it for its simplicity. But I also believe you can't put a passport on music. It doesn't belong to one section of the country. Music is international. The notes, the sounds, belong to anyone who can sing them.\"\n\nDolly Parton soon followed suit with her sister. By 1976, an olive branch of friendship had been extended between the vocalists. Newton-John's cover version of Dolly's \"Jolene\" on her 1976 album \"Come On Over\" signaled the end of their separation. Related, the ACE ended its time as an organization by 1981.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to undo anything I've done. Everything that may not have appeared to be good for me outside was a learning experience to be who I am now. So, I wouldn't not want to have experienced the difficulties because they're part of your growth,\" noted Newton-John to CNBC in 2019.\n\nNewton-John's success in country music mirrors that of another country icon who polarizes pop and traditional country purveyors: Shania Twain. Between 1975-1979, songs including \"Have You Never Been Mellow,\" \"Please Mr. Please,\" \"Let It Shine,\" \"Come on Over,\" and 1979's \"Dancin' 'Round and 'Round\" all featured songwriters from outside the Music Row establishment.\n\nLike Twain, her success eclipsed pop, country music, and all then-established notions of female success in mainstream entertainment.\n\nRegarding the John Farrar-penned and Abbey Road-recorded \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" (a gold-selling, GRAMMY-nominated single in 1975), modern criticism still bears much of the divided belief concerning Newton-John's talent, country music's pop evolutions of that era, and matters of critical taste.\n\nAs a singer, Newton-John is a warm and intuitive interpreter; she was, after all, enough of a communicator to sell (1974 hit) 'I Honestly Love You.' But there's nothing in 'Have You Never Been Mellow' for her to latch onto. Instead, it's pure drift; even the hook never quite registers.\"\n\nOlivia Newton-John's career included forays into other subjective arts, including film, where her 1978 star turn alongside John Travolta in \"Grease\" was followed by her 1980 turn in the futuristic roller-skating film \"Xanadu.\"\n\nWhether in art or craft, Olivia Newton-John excelled at delivering her own -- both subjective and satisfying -- takes on her creative, emotional, and personal truth.\n\nIn the previously mentioned 25-year-old Associated Press interview, she highlights a slew of performers she inspired, naming Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, and Martina McBride in that number.\n\n\"It's nice to see these girl country singers doing well.\""
