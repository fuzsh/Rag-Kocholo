        "text": "The death of the British-born, Australian-raised performer was announced on her Instagram account, saying she \"passed away peacefully\" at her ranch home \"surrounded by family and friends\".\n\nFlowers were left at Olivia Newton-John's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday after it was announced the British-Born Australian singer and actress had died.\n\nOne of her most fervent fans, Christine Taylor, 49, from Los Angeles laid flowers next to the star and told Reuters, \"For me, it hits hard. When your idols die, it's just like even a piece of your family too because you grew up with them.\"\n\nAnother fan, Kira Pettet, 55, from Los Angeles, came out in a 'Xanadu' T-shirt and a Newton-John face mask to pay tribute.\n\nPettet said \"She meant... means and meant everything to me, everything concerning her. She just like was always in the back of my mind - it sounds obsessive but her music just took me out of a lot of dark times.\"\n\nOthers, like Bonnie Alexander, 70, from Calabasas, only learned of Newton-John's passing by seeing people crowded around the star.\n\n\"I had no idea that Olivia Newton-John had passed away until I saw this and everybody here. I'm just totally shocked and very sad,\" she said.\n\nNewton-John, a four-time Grammy winner, had disclosed in 2017 that a recurrence of breast cancer had metastasized and spread to her lower back, forcing her to cancel performances. Twenty-five years earlier Newton-John had undergone a partial mastectomy, leading her to become an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues and to establish a cancer treatment-research facility in Australia.\n\nNewton-John, actress and singer was born in Cambridge, England in 1948. When Newton-John was six, her family moved to Melbourne, Australia where she appeared on talent shows and in a telemovie. After winning the prize of a trip to Britain, Newton-John travelled to her county of birth, where she recorded a single and toured nightclubs around Europe as part of a singing duo.\n\nAmong the favourites for the 1974 Eurovision Song contest was Britain's entry of Newton-John with a song called 'Long Live Love.' Newton-John finished fourth behind Swedish pop group ABBA who won the competition with the song 'Waterloo.'\n\nThe album released with the 'Long Live Love' single, included the hit 'I Honestly Love You' which earned Newton-John two Grammy awards with success on both the Adult Contemporary and Country charts.\n\nOlivia Newton-John had her biggest career success with the 1978 film adaptation of the musical 'Grease,' which would become one of the most popular musicals in Hollywood history, starring alongside John Travolta as a high school senior.\n\nThe popularity of 'Grease' has endured since its first release in 1978 with numerous re-releases, and special screenings as a much-loved and classic film.\n\nIn 1980, Newton-John appeared in the film 'Xanadu' and in 1981 released the song 'Physical' shedding the 'good girl' image she had in Grease. The song's accompanying video featured her in workout clothes and a headband, which fuelled a fashion trend. While filming Xanadu, Newton-John met actor Matt Lattanzi who she married in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, Newton-John had her first and only child, Chloe Rose Lattanzi. She later divorce Lattanzi in 1995. Before a planned tour in 1992, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer, which she recovered from but which returned in 2017."
