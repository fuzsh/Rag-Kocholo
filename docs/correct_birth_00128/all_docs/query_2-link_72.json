As a singer, actress, and philanthropist, she inspired countless people around the world with her talent, grace, and resilience. Her contributions to music, film, and charitable causes have left an indelible mark on the world.\n\nWe were all devastated to learn of her passing after a long battle with cancer at the age of 73. But we’re taking a moment to honour her incredible life and legacy. In this article, we’re diving into her early years, how she rose to fame, and her inspiring journey through cancer.\n\nHow Did Olivia Newton-John Die?\n\nOn August 8, 2022, Olivia passed away peacefully surrounded by her loved ones at her ranch in Santa Ynez, California. Her husband, John Easterling, confirmed the news of her death in an emotional Instagram post, asking for privacy during that difficult time.\n\n“Dame Olivia Newton-John (73) passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends,” John wrote. “Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.”\n\nOlivia’s inspiring journey with breast cancer has been well-documented. She was first diagnosed with the disease in 1992 but, after undergoing treatment, she was able to beat it. She was diagnosed again in 2013 and 2017, and once again, she showed remarkable resilience and courage in her battle against the illness.\n\nDespite her struggles, Olivia remained positive and continued to inspire others. Her dedication to breast cancer research led her to establish the Olivia Newton-John Foundation, which aimed to fund research into plant medicine and cancer treatment.\n\nIn his Instagram post, John Easterling paid tribute to Olivia’s legacy and her pioneering work in the field of cancer research. “Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer,” he wrote.\n\nOlivia’s passing has left a huge void in the entertainment industry and in the hearts of her fans around the world. As tributes pour in, it is clear that Olivia’s legacy as a symbol of hope and triumph will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nWhere Was Olivia Newton-John Born?\n\nBorn on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, England, Olivia’s family later moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she was raised. Her love for music began in childhood where she went from performing in talent shows and contests to later forming a band to perform at local clubs and bars.\n\nHow Old Was Olivia Newton-John in Grease?\n\nOlivia’s most famous role came in the 1978 classic movie musical “Grease” where she played the sweet and innocent Sandy Olsson opposite John Travolta’s rebellious Danny Zuko. At the time of filming, Newton-John was 29 years old.\n\nWho Was Olivia Newton-John Married to?\n\nOlivia was married twice in her lifetime. First, to English actor Matt Lattanzi, whom she met while filming “Xanadu” in 1980. The couple tied the knot in December 1984 and welcomed a daughter named Chloe in January 1986. Unfortunately, the marriage didn’t last and they divorced in 1997.\n\nOlivia’s second marriage was to John Easterling, an entrepreneur and herbal health expert. He was by her side until the very end.\n\nOlivia Newton-John was not only an iconic figure in the entertainment industry but also a compassionate and generous person who contributed to numerous charitable causes. Her work and legacy will continue to inspire and uplift her fans and admirers for generations to come.\n\nWant some entertainment stories? Click through the articles below:"
