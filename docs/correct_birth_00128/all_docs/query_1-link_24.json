        "text": "Olivia Newton-John (September 26, 1948,[1] - August 8, 2022) was an English-born Australian singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her role as Sandy in Grease. She guest starred on Glee as a very mean, rude and unthoughtful, fictional version of herself in 2010.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nShe was born in Cambridge, England to Brinley Newton-John and Irene, who was born in Berlin. Her mother's family had left Germany before World War II to avoid the Nazi regime (Max Born, Newton-John's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and her maternal grandmother was of paternal Jewish ancestry). Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.[1][2] She has one brother, Hugh, and one sister, Rona; sadly Rona died from brain cancer in 2013.[2][3]\n\nNewton-John married Matt Lattanzi in December 1984[4] and their daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, was born in January 1986.[5] Newton-John and Lattanzi divorced in 1995.[6]\n\nNewton-John dated Patrick McDermott for nine years before his disappearance (and presumed death) in 2005; McDermott was found to be alive in 2010.[7]\n\nShe married John Easterling in June 2012 and they reside in Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida.[8][9] Newton-John and Easterling made headlines when their contractor was found dead in their home on August 20, 2013. The death was self inflected and the investigation was concluded on August 21, 2013.[10]\n\nNewton-John unveiled her Grease look a like wax statue at Madam Tussauds on August 9, 2014.[11]\n\nNewton-John was honored at Nevada Ballet Theatre's 32nd Annual BLACK & WHITE BALL as Woman of the Year in January 2016.[12]\n\nNewton-John died of breast cancer on August 8, 2022.\n\nOverview[]\n\nSeason One[]\n\nBad Reputation[]\n\nIn Bad Reputation, Olivia Newton-John heads to McKinley High after she heard her daughter laughing at a video, which was Sue's rendition of her music video, Physical. Olivia remembers how mediocre her first video was, so she asks Sue to help recreate the video for a new generation and as a way to both redeem themselves.\n\nJourney[]\n\nIn Journey, Olivia is a celebrity judge at Regionals alongside Josh Groban, Sue and Rod Remington. One glee club, Aural Intensity, performs her song Magic in the mash-up Magic/You Raise Me Up, and because of that she believes they were the ones who deserved to win. She also berated New Directions because there was no production value to their performance, writing McKinley off as a \"poor person school.\" When Sue tries to explain that not all kids grow up as privileged as she was, she doesn't care and votes New Directions for third place.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1965 Funny Things Happen Down Under Olivia 1970 Toomorrow 1971 Getaway with Cliff TV movie 1972 The Case TV movie 1978 Grease Sandy Olsen 1980 Xanadu Kira 1983 Two of a Kind Debbie 1989 Michael Jackson: Liberian Girl video short 1990 A Mom for Christmas'm Amy Miller TV movie 1994 A Christmas Romance Julia Stonecypher 1995 Snowy River: The McGregor Saga Joanna Walker (\"Servant of the People,\" \"The Search,\" and \"The Lost Child\") 1996 It's My Party Lina Bingham 1998 The Christmas Angel: A Story on Ice Female Storyteller TV movie 2000 Sordid Lives Bitsy Mae Harling 2001 The Wilde Girls Jasmine Wilde TV movie 2008 Sordid Lives: The Series Bitsy Mae Harling (12 episodes) 2010 Glee Herself (\"Bad Reputation\" and \"Journey\") Score: A Hockey Musical Hope Gordon 2011 A Few Best Men Barbara\n\nSongs[]\n\nDuets[]\n\nQuotes[]\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\nOlivia Newton-John's website"
