        "text": "Olivia Newton-John was worth roughly $60 million at the time of her death on Aug. 8, 2022. However, she spent her last years giving as much as she could to charity, reports The Express’ recent article entitled “Olivia Newton-John fortune: Incredible final acts of generosity as inheritance split.” How did Olivia Newton-John plan her estate? Did she make charitable donations? Below is what we know so far:\n\nNewton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992. The Australian singer underwent extensive treatment including a partial mastectomy and was given a clean bill of health. However, in 2013, she was told she had breast cancer a second time and once again she beat the disease, getting another all-clear after treatment.\n\nSoon after her second diagnosis, the singer founded the Olivia Newton-John Cancer & Wellness Centre, which reportedly cost $189 million at a Melbourne hospital. In 2015, she founded the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and in 2020 launched the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund which sponsors research in herbal cancer treatments.\n\nIn 2017, she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and began selling off parts of her impressive real estate portfolio which spanned multiple countries with all of the proceeds going towards her charities. She reportedly sold her incredible Australian home for $4.6 million.\n\nNewton-John had originally purchased the 187-acre property in the eighties and rebuilt the home in the early 2000s.\n\nOver the decades at the home, she is said to have planted 10,000 trees on the property and sold it with the intent that someone equally involved and loving of wildlife would continue her work.\n\nShe also wanted to sell her Californian horse ranch for $5.4 million. However, she later decided to instead live out her last days at the home and transferred the ownership as part of getting her personal and financial affairs in order, to her husband John Easterling.\n\nThe singer married actor Matt Lattanzi in 1984 and gave birth to their only child Chloe Rose Lattanzi, now 36. Newton-John got married to John Easterling in 2008, who is reportedly expected to inherit her fortune alongside Chloe."
