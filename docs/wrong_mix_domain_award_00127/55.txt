First Nobel Prize Winners in the World

The Nobel Prize, a globally esteemed recognition, honors individuals who have made enduring contributions to the progress of peace. Amidst numerous notable laureates, it is crucial to acknowledge the pioneers who established the groundwork for this prestigious award. Jean Henri Dunant and Frederic Passy, both exceptional individuals, emerged as the first Nobel Prize winners in 1901. This article underscores their remarkable efforts in the realm of peace and humanitarian pursuits.

Jean-Henri Dunant, First Nobel Prize Winner in the World

Jean-Henri Dunant, founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901. He was inspired to create the ICRC after witnessing the horrors of the Battle of Solferino. Dunant also had a vision for a neutral colony in Palestine. He played a crucial role in the Geneva Convention’s creation. Despite being born wealthy, he died in poverty. He donated his prize money to charity and established a “free bed” for the poorest patients, leaving a lasting legacy of humanitarianism.

Frederic Passy, First Nobel Prize Winner in the World

Frederic Passy, a French lawyer who lived from 1822 to 1912, held the role of founder and President in the inaugural French Peace Society known as the “Societe francaise pour I’arbitrage entre nations” since 1889. These organizations can be seen as precursors to the later-established Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and the League of Nations. Passy earned the title of an “apostle of peace” due to his relentless and vivid writings, as well as his eloquent speeches marked by a powerful voice and expressive gestures. Notably, he challenged his audience intellectually while advocating for peace.
