        "text": "On this day 60 years ago C. S. Lewis died.\n\nFor most people, this day is remembered as the day of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. For that reason, Lewis was often not mentioned. The only silver lining in that is that his writing seems so immediate, a person could be forgiven for thinking he is still alive.\n\nFor the first time I can remember, I am repeating something from our quotations series. Today, all the quotations are not only by the same author — C. .S. Lewis — but from the same book, Mere Christianity. The scripture verses are not part of the quotations, but have been added by me afterwards!\n\nI also wish to say something about the pictures. The one below is of the type more commonly seen, but in researching Lewis afresh for November, 2023, I discovered the above picture of a younger Lewis, and decided to include both. (I apologize for not noting the source of the younger picture.)\n\nAlso, this time around, there an excerpt below from a piece about Lewis I wrote for other media.\n\n“Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of – throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.”\n\nAnd we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit. II Cor. 3:18\n\n“A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is… A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in.”\n\n“When a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the evil that is still left in him. When a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less.”\n\nSubmit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n\nJames 4:7\n\n“[To have Faith in Christ] means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.”\n\nAs they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”\n\nLuke 9:57\n\n“I remember Christian teachers telling me long ago that I must hate a bad man’s actions but not hate the bad man: or, as they would say, hate the sin but not the sinner. …I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction: how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life — namely myself. However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit or greed, I went on loving myself. There had never been the slightest difficulty about it. In fact the very reason why I hated the things was that I loved the man. Just because I loved myself, I was sorry to find that I was the sort of man who did those things.”\n\nAll of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.\n\nIsaiah 64:6\n\n“God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there.”\n\nSuch hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us, for God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us.\n\nRomans 5:5 (AMP)\n\nHere’s the link to the quotations. There are eight pages. Choose a couple that I have not selected here, read them slowly to get an idea of what they’re about, and then ask yourself, what scripture verse might I attach to Lewis’ thoughts on this subject?\n\nAbout Clive Staples Lewis\n\nIt’s been 60 years since November 22, 1963. A day etched in memory as the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.\n\nFor every breaking news story, there is often another story that gets pushed off the front page. Such is the case here.\n\nThe same November day, writer C. S. Lewis died.\n\nA recent article in The Catholic Review noted that Lewis’ books are actually gaining popularity all these years later, as are his academic writings.\n\nUntil recently, paradoxically, C.S. Lewis had been largely ignored at Oxford University, where he taught for three decades until his early death from bone cancer Nov. 22, 1963. He gained greater recognition in the United States, which he never visited.\n\nA writer at the C.S. Lewis Foundation notes:\n\nI’ve often thought he would have been an intimidating man to hang out with. He and his wife Joy played Scrabble in five languages, including Chaucerian English. Lewis kept up a correspondence with an Italian priest in Latin, the only language they had in common. Of the hundreds of books in his library, a visitor could pick one at random, start to read aloud any sentence – and listen to Lewis quote the rest by memory.\n\nN. T. Wright adds that\n\nMillions around the world have been introduced to, and nurtured within, the Christian faith through his work where their own preachers and teachers were not giving them what they needed. That was certainly true of me.\n\nLewis did not see himself as having a “crisis” conversion to the faith, but compared it to someone in a sleeper car onboard a European train, who wakes up and realizes he is in another country. Theologians refer to this as “process” conversion.\n\nIf you haven’t already met “Jack,” as his friends called him, start with the book Mere Christianity, but read it slowly, perhaps only a few pages per day.\n\nHis life and death are being marked around the world this month by everything from lectures to concerts."
