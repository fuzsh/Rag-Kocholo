        "text": "Keith Stokes'\n\n2004 UK Trip\n\nDay 4 Monday April 5 (continued)\n\nFor me, the highlight of the C. S. Lewis tour of Oxfor was the stop at Holy Trinity Church in Headington Quarry. Ron Brind has a key to Holy Trinity Church and I photographed Jack & Warnie's pew and the wonderful engraved Narnia window next to it. Then we visited Jack & Warnie's graves and the grave of Mrs. Janie King Moore, who's relationship with Jack leaves so many unanswered questions. Ron gave me some ivy leaves from the tree above Jack's grave.\n\nThe Parish Church of Holy Trinity - Jack's pew was next to a pillar on the left (out of\n\nphoto) where he and Warnie were somewhat shielded from view. There is now a\n\nplaque on the pew.\n\nThe Narnia window by Sally Scott commemorates the loss of two children and\n\nis next to the pew where C. S. Lewis would sit.\n\nJack and Warnie's grave\n\nC. S. Lewis' grave is just behind the one in the foreground, Holy Trinity Church is\n\nin the background.\n\nJanie King Moore's grave - Ron believes it may be miss marked\n\nThe balance of the C. S. Lewis tour included a long stop at Jack & Warnie's home, The Kilns, and a walk through the woods to the small pond near it. Visitors are not permitted to enter the home, which is owned by a foundation which Ron disdains. The last stops on the tour were the crematorium where Joy's ashes were scattered, the hospital where Joy died and finally The Eagle and Child pub. The \"Bird & Babe\" where the Inklings (including Jack, Warnie, JRR Tolkien, Charles Williams and Hugo Dyson) met each week.\n\nThe Kilns - the cross was not on the roof when Jack lived there and the room in\n\nthe right foreground was a metal garage or shed.\n\nJack \"C.S.\" Lewis' office was the first window\n\nMarker near where Helen Joy Davidman's ashes were scattered\n\nI had hard apple cider and an excellent steak pie in the \"Rabbit Room\" in the Eagle and Child where the Inklings met in the '30s & '40s. The walls have many photos of Lewis & Tolkien."
