        "text": "Background\n\nC.S. Lewis was born on November 29, 1898, in Belfast, Ireland. He was born to his father, Albert James Lewis, and his mother, Florence Augusta Lewis, the daughter of a priest. His older brother was Warren Hamilton Lewis. Lewis was baptized by his grandfather a year later. As a boy, he loved animal stories so much that he wrote his own. He was schooled privately up to age nine. He later went to England to a preparatory school, where he lost his faith and became an Atheist. Lewis joined university in 1917 and later joined the officers training corps on his way into the army.\n\nLewis joined Oxford as an undergraduate and shortly won honors in three areas of study. He was elected to various positions in both Oxford and Cambridge. Most of his work focused on the later Middle Ages. He was a great writer, and his informal circle became known as “The Inklings.” In addition to his scholarly work, he doubled as a novelist, writing fictional works for adults and children such as “Trilogy” and the “Narnia Fantasy.” In 1933, he wrote “The Pilgrim’s Regress” after reverting to Christianity. Lewis wrote “Pelerandra,” his second novel about a new garden of Eden with a new Adam and Eve, but on the planet Venus. His most popular work, “The Chronicles of Narnia,” has sold over 100 million copies in over 41 languages across the world. Lewis wrote other works like “Heaven and Hell,” “The Great Divorce,” and “The Screwtape Letters.” He wrote “Four Lovers,” which describes the four stages of love. “Till We Have Mature Faces” was his last novel which he described as his most mature work.\n\nTo this day, his work attracts new readers. In 2008, the “Times” ranked him 11th among their most influential British writers since 1945. His Christian writings and apologetics are used by many Christian denominations today. Several biographies have been written about him, some by his close friends. His works have been aired on television, made into films, and played in theaters. In 2021, a drama on the life and conversion of Lewis was released. The public has access to the C.S Lewis Nature Reserve which lies behind his house."
