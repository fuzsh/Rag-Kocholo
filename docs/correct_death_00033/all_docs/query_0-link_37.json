        "text": "You may have heard this story before. My wife, Kathy, and I were on a city bus in Oxford, England, about to get off a couple of blocks from the Kilns, the longtime home of C.S. Lewis.\n\nA big part of that winter trip to England was our arranged private tour of the famous house where the celebrated Christian writer once lived. He resided there from 1930 to his death in 1963.\n\nOn the almost-empty bus were a man and a woman, not together. We found out the woman attended Holy Trinity Church, the Anglican parish where Lewis and his brother, Warren, had sat in their regular pew for years.\n\nThe man had a different take on Lewis. As I recall, he said in his British accent that yes, he knew where Lewis' house was but that \"I don't agree with what he stood for.\"\n\nAs someone who strongly agrees with the Christianity that Lewis stood for, I was dismayed but not surprised. After all, Oxford University, where the author of \"Mere Christianity\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" taught, had not put its association with him front and center through the decades. Neither had England as a whole. In fact, after his rise to fame in the 1940s and 1950s had faded, Lewis had become more popular in America than in his home country.\n\nSo I'm happy that this Nov. 22, 50 years after Lewis died - on the same day as President Kennedy - the professor, writer of children's books and creative defender of the faith will be recognized with a memorial stone in Poets' Corner, the cluttered area of Westminster Abbey where 108 creative people already are either buried or have their names inscribed for posterity. Among them are Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen.\n\nDespite some signs of spiritual life last time Kathy and I made it to the United Kingdom, the UK is not a nation of churchgoers. Even in his own day, some considered Lewis an intellectual rebel for embracing Christianity. When he made the cover of Time magazine in 1947, the caption read, \"Oxford's C.S. Lewis. His heresy: Christianity.\"\n\nMichael Ward, whose story, \"How Lewis Lit the Way\" is in this month's Christianity Today, told the magazine earlier that \"It takes a while in Britain for a great man to be recognized as such. But Lewis has been safely dead now for 50 years, and we can afford to recognize him as the major figure he was.\"\n\nThe figure who wrote about a devil's apprentice and a Christlike lion also contributed much to literary criticism and medieval studies, which gives nonbelievers something to latch onto. \"He is, by any standard, someone who is a serious intellectual … who thinks about the society we're in,\" said Rowan Williams, former archbishop of Canterbury, in Christianity Today.\n\nLewis is buried in his home churchyard, a mile or two from his Oxford home. Kathy and I had to go to great lengths to get there. Now millions will have a chance to see his name inside one of Britain's best-known tourist attractions.\n\nMike Haynes teaches journalism at Amarillo College.

Lewis Foundation's efforts to establish a C.S. Lewis College: After failing to raise enough money to own and operate a picturesque campus in Northfield, Mass., the foundation apparently decided to settle for small steps. It has bought \"Green Pastures,\" a historic house across the street from that campus. Several generations of the family of D.L. Moody, the renowned evangelist, lived in the home, which will be converted into a C.S. Lewis Study Center."
