        "text": "Are you C. S. Lewis? Are you related to C. S. Lewis?\n\nCan you help me with my homework?\n\nNope.\n\nOkay, so who are you and why did you create this website?\n\nMy name is John Visser. In 1994, while reading The Chronicles of Narnia for the umpteenth time, I thought I'd try searching this newfangled \"World Wide Web\" for information about its author. When I discovered there was nothing available (and I mean nothing — it was 30 years ago, after all), I did some old-fashioned research and launched this site on December 5, 1994 so that others would have a place online to learn about C. S. Lewis.\n\nOf course, in the 30 years since its launch, countless other resources (including official ones) have been created that are more in-depth and perhaps more interesting and interactive, but Into the Wardrobe was the first. It was my \"15 minutes of fame,\" so to speak.\n\nI am definitely not a C. S. Lewis expert, but I do enjoy some of Lewis' books (my favorites are The Chronicles of Narnia and Till We Have Faces). The creation and continued maintenance of this site is a labor of love, so if you've found something of value here, please consider making a small donation to show your thanks and help support my efforts.\n\nI have questions that need answering! Can you help?\n\nYes, but not personally — that's what this website is for, and this FAQ is where I suggest you start. There's also a nifty search box on each page that will let you search the entire site.\n\nIf you are still unable to get the answers you are seeking, try some other resources, use a search engine, or perhaps a more traditional method like a library or bookstore.\n\nDo you have any additional information you can send me?\n\nSorry, I do not. Everything I have is already on this site.\n\nDo you accept content submissions?\n\nWhy, yes I do. If you have a favorite quote, a favorite website, an essay you've written, or something else you feel belongs on this site, send it along and I'll review it for inclusion on the site. Thanks!\n\nCan I use the material on your site for [insert reason]?\n\nSince I do not own much of the material here, I cannot give permission to use it. Please refer to the copyright page. Also, please note that I am not available for questions regarding how to include this material in your bibliography.\n\nWhy aren't there publication dates on the essays?\n\nYeah, I know. Sorry about that. They were all submitted many years ago when I first started the website, and at the time I didn't bother finding that out. All I can tell you is they were published some time elsewhere before 2000, and reproduced on this site with the author's permission.\n\nCan I get access to your archive of quotes that you use on the website?\n\nI'm sorry, but no — copyright laws, you know. I was granted permission to include them here, with the request not to give access to the archive. The only way to see the quotes is by visiting the site. Of course, nowadays you can find all sorts of archives elsewhere.\n\nHow can I contact C. S. Lewis?\n\nUnfortunately, you can't. He died on November 22, 1963. That's the same day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Aldous Huxley also died that day.\n\nI have questions about the life of C. S. Lewis. Can you help?\n\nYou're in luck, because there's an outline of the life of C. S. Lewis on this site.\n\nWhat does the \"C. S.\" stand for?\n\nHis full name is Clive Staples Lewis.\n\nWhat did C. S. Lewis write?\n\nPerhaps his most famous writings are The Chronicles of Narnia (which are comprised of seven books), The Space Trilogy, Mere Christianity, and The Screwtape Letters. Complete lists of his works can be found on this site.\n\nWhere can I download the text of C. S. Lewis' books?\n\nMost of Lewis' work is still under copyright, and will be for some time. However, if you do some digging around the web, you probably can find what you're looking for (but no, I won't tell you where). Of course, you can purchase eBooks, or find the hard copies at a bookstore or your local library.\n\nWhat did C. S. Lewis look like?\n\nJust like this.\n\nIn Letters to Children, he described himself as \"...tall, fat, rather bald, red-faced, double-chinned, black-haired, hav[ing] a deep voice, and wear[ing] glasses for reading.\"\n\nThere's a gallery of photos on this site, if you'd like to see more.\n\nWhat did C. S. Lewis sound like?\n\nBeing born in Northern Ireland, then moving to England at 10 years old and being educated at public school and Oxford, Lewis had a rather unique accent. Hear it for yourself:\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.\n\nWhy was C. S. Lewis known as Jack?\n\nAs a child, Lewis had a dog called \"Jacksie\" whom he really loved. When he was four years old, the poor dog got run down by one of the first cars in Ireland. He then said that from that point on he'll be known by the name of his dog (although he also didn't like his birth names). Eventually, the name evolved from \"Jacksie\" to Jack. From that point on, all his friends and teachers called him that, except for one of his tutors.\n\nIs it true that C. S. Lewis was an atheist at one point in his life?\n\nYes. Lewis was raised in a Christian home (Church of Ireland), and became an atheist when he was 15. He converted back to Christianity (Church of England) when he was 33 with the help of his friend, J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nWho was Joy Davidman?\n\nHelen Joy Davidman was an American poet and writer who first met C. S. Lewis in 1952, after corresponding for two years. A rapid friendship developed and Joy moved to England in 1953. In 1956, after her visitor's visa could not be renewed, Lewis agreed to enter into a civil marriage contract with her on April 23, 1956, so that she could continue to live in the UK. Lewis told a friend that \"the marriage was a pure matter of friendship and expediency.\"\n\nThey continued to live separately after the civil marriage, and in October 1956, Joy was diagnosed with cancer. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he had fallen in love with her, writing to a friend that \"new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us.\"\n\nJoy underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis (Jack's brother) wrote in his diary: \"One of the most painful days of my life. Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time.\"\n\nThe relationship between Joy and C. S. Lewis had developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage, but it was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time because she was divorced. However, a friend and Anglican priest, Reverend Peter Bide, performed the ceremony at the hospital on March 21, 1957. The marriage did not win wide approval among Lewis' social circle, and some of his friends and colleagues avoided the new couple.\n\nJoy's cancer went into remission, and the couple went on a belated honeymoon to Wales and Ireland. In October 1959, the cancer had returned. The following year, Lewis fulfilled her lifelong wish to visit Greece, and shortly upon their return, Joy Davidman died on July 13, 1960.\n\nWho was Janie Moore?\n\nJanie King Moore was the mother of Paddy Moore, Lewis' closest comrade-in-arms during the First World War. Lewis reported that the two young men made a pledge that if either man didn't make it home, the survivor would take care of Lewis' father and Moore's mother. Paddy Moore died in the war, and Lewis fulfilled that pledge for years, contributing towards Mrs. Moore's finances when he was still a poor student and setting up a home with her and Moore's young sister Maureen when he obtained a teaching position and could afford one. When her declining health (years later) required professional care, he faithfully visited the nursing home until she died. Maureen later succeeded to a Scottish title and became Lady Dunbar of Hempriggs.\n\nThe exact nature of Lewis' relationship with Janie is not certain: many people have surmised that it is connected with the \"enormous emotional episode\" that Lewis refers to in his book, Surprised by Joy, but says that he is not at liberty to write about. Walter Hooper wrote that \"the combination of motive, means and opportunity invites, though it does not demand, the conclusion that Janie King Moore and C. S. Lewis were lovers.\"\n\nJanie Moore is sometimes represented as the villain in the story of C. S. Lewis. Owen Barfield says people have turned her into \"a sort of baleful stepmother.\" Warren, Jack's brother, described her relationship with Lewis as a \"strange, self-imposed slavery.\" On the other hand, George Sayer wrote, \"Some of those who have written about C. S. Lewis regard his living with Mrs. Moore as odd, even sinister. This was not the view of those of us who visited his home in the thirties. Like his other pupils, I thought it completely normal that a woman, probably a widow, would make a home for a young bachelor. We had no difficulty accepting her, even when we came to realise that she was not his mother.\"\n\nDid C. S. Lewis win any awards or honors?\n\nThe Last Battle won the Carnegie Award, the highest honor for children's literature in the United Kingdom. Also, Winston Churchill offered Lewis a CBE (Commander of the British Empire) in 1951, but he turned it down.\n\nAre there any tours of C. S. Lewis sites in Ireland or England? Are the Kilns open to the public?\n\nYes, there are! If you're interested in learning about the sites and how to make reservations, I recommend getting Touring C. S. Lewis' Ireland and England by Perry Bramlett and Ronald Higdon.\n\nYou can also contact The C. S. Lewis Foundation for information on how to make a reservation to visit The Kilns, where Lewis lived for much of his life.\n\nAre there any other C. S. Lewis related sites that are open to the public?\n\nIn the United Kingdom:\n\nMagdalen College, Oxford is often open to public visits in the vacations.\n\nHoly Trinity Churchyard Headington Quarry, Oxford (the site of Jack's grave) is open.\n\nThe Eagle and Child (the Bird and Baby) where many of the Inklings meetings were held is open during normal pub opening hours.\n\nIn the United States:\n\nWheaton College in the far western suburbs of Chicago, houses an extensive collection relating not only to C. S. Lewis, but also to G. K. Chesterton and Dorothy Sayers. Among its treasures is the original wardrobe that C. S. Lewis supposedly had in mind when he wrote the Narnia books."
