        "text": "\"The art of Biography is different from Geography,\" wrote the English wit and novelist E.C. Bentley. \"Geography is about maps, But Biography is about chaps.\" Now biographers are grateful for any help they can get. Bentley's witticism might seem somewhat whimsical and insignificant, yet it points to an issue that every biographer has to wrestle with - the reliability of memory. You can look at maps. But you have to rely on \"chaps\" to remember what happened in the past. What if they get things wrong?\n\nI came to appreciate this point when researching my biography of C.S. Lewis. I had long been interested in Lewis, and found him to repay study. Somehow, there always seemed to be more under the surface of his writings, waiting to be discovered. I began to read Lewis in the mid-1970s, as a student at Oxford University. Over a period of decades, I gradually came to appreciate that his intellectual range and imaginative vision were far greater than I had appreciated.\n\nIn 2008, I began to consider the idea of writing a new biography of Lewis, which would try to do justice to his Irish roots, get the institutional complexities of his Oxford period right and explore how he initially discovered Christianity and then became one of its leading public advocates. I decided to do the job properly, and spent fifteen months reading everything Lewis had published in chronological order - including the vast collection of letters recently assembled and edited by Walter Hooper. This, I thought, would help me understand the flow and development of both Lewis's ideas, and allow me to choose some good quotes to include in the text. After a few months, I began to realize that something was wrong.\n\nIn his celebrated autobiography Surprised by Joy, Lewis writes of his conversion. He finally abandoned his resistance to an approaching God, becoming the \"most dejected and reluctant convert in all England\". Lewis dates this development to \"Trinity Term 1929\" - that is, to the eight weeks from 28 April and 22 June 1929. This has become a landmark in Lewis studies, one of the few fixed dates in Lewis's spiritual development that we know with any precision. But as I read his writings from 1929, I sensed no change in his voice or tone. There was no indication of any kind of such a radical realignment. If Lewis did indeed come to believe in God in Trinity Term 1929, it appears to have made no discernible difference to his outlook or thought. But his writings of 1930 tell a different story.\n\nThere are four good reasons for challenging Lewis's recollection that this is to be dated to Trinity Term 1929:\n\nA close and continuous reading of his works - especially his correspondence - reveals no sign of a significant change in tone or mood throughout 1929 and even into the first weeks of 1930. Between September 1925 and January 1930, Lewis's writings disclose no hint of any radical change of heart or mind. If Lewis was converted in 1929, this supposedly pivotal event made no impact on his writings - including his letters to his closest friends at that time, Owen Barfield and Arthur Greeves.\n\nLewis's widowed father died in September 1929. If Lewis's chronology of his own conversion is accepted, Lewis had come to believe in God at the time of his father's death. Yet Lewis's correspondence makes no reference at all to any impact of a belief in God, however emergent, upon his final days spent with his father, his subsequent funeral, and its emotional aftermath. Might, I wondered, the death of Lewis's father have been a stimulus to him to think about God, rather than something he approached from an existing theistic perspective? If Lewis discovered God in the summer of 1930, his father's death the previous year might have marked a turning point in his thinking.\n\nLewis's account of the dynamics of his conversion in Surprised by Joy speaks of God closing in on him, taking the initiative and ultimately overwhelming him. We find echoes of this language in a short letter to Owen Barfield, written hastily on 3 February 1930, which speaks of the \"spirit\" becoming \"much more personal,\" \"taking the offensive\" and \"behaving just like God.\" Lewis asked Barfield to come and see him soon. Otherwise, he might have \"entered a monastery.\" Barfield was later unequivocal about the significance of this letter for Lewis's spiritual development: it marked \"the beginning of his conversion.\" The letter reflects Lewis's language about the pressures he experienced immediately before his conversion. Yet this conversion is clearly ahead of him, not behind him.\n\nLewis makes it clear that his behaviour changed as a result of his new belief in God. Although still not committed to Christianity, he now began to attend both his local parish church on Sundays, and college chapel on weekdays. Yet Lewis's correspondence makes no reference to regular attendance at any Oxford church or Magdalen College chapel in 1929, or the first half of 1930. Yet things change decisively in October 1930. In a letter to his close friend and confidant Arthur Greeves, dated 29 October 1930, Lewis mentions that he now goes to bed earlier than he used, to, as he has now \"started going to morning chapel at 8.\" This is presented as a new development, a significant change in his routine, dating from the beginning of the academic year 1930-31. The date of this change of habit makes sense if Lewis discovered God in the summer of 1930 - perhaps in June 1930, right at the end of the academic year. This would explain Lewis starting to attend college chapel in October 1930. The Oxford academic year resumes in October, thus giving Lewis the opportunity to begin attending college chapel regularly.\n\nThe traditional date of Lewis's conversion, based on his own narrative in Surprised by Joy and repeated in every major study of Lewis to date, clearly needs review. The best explanation of things is that Lewis's subjective location of the event in his inner world is regarded as reliable, but his chronological location of the event in terms of his outer world is misplaced. If Lewis was converted during any Trinity Term, it was the Trinity Term of 1930, not 1929 - namely, at some point between 27 April and 21 June 1930.\n\nThis clearly raises the question of the reliability of Lewis's memory. How could he misremember such an important date in his life? If this was the tipping-point in Lewis's life, surely he would remember it in detail?\n\nThe answer, I realized, was quite simple. Lewis was terrible about remembering dates - however, he retained a vivid memory of his thoughts and feelings. Subjectively, Lewis gives us a superb account of his thoughts, longings and concerns, leading up to his conversion. But he is unreliable when it comes to relating his internal and external world. When it comes to dates, months, and days, Lewis gets things muddled.\n\nLewis himself remarked on this failing in 1957, shortly after the publication of Surprised by Joy: he could now, he confessed, \"never remember dates.\" His older brother Warnie declared that Lewis had a \"life-long inability to keep track of dates.\" When Lewis became Vice-President of Magdalen College, Oxford in 1941 - a fixed-term appointment with essentially administrative responsibilities, which rotated around the fellowship - he was soon found to be incapable of carrying out one of the chief responsibilities of this role: arranging for the booking of rooms for college meetings or private engagements. Lewis simply could not remember dates. Rooms were double-booked - if they were booked at all.\n\nSo did Lewis just misremember this date? After all, Surprised by Joy was written twenty years after the event. Perhaps. Yet the more I read this work, especially in the light of possible influences from the late classical period (such as Augustine of Hippo) and the Middle Ages (such as Dante), I began to realize there was more going on. Lewis clearly regarded writing his autobiography, not simply as conveying information about himself, but discerning structure in his life. Like Augustine's Confessions, it was a narrated account of prevenient grace - the moments when Lewis, like Augustine, realized he was being redirected; that seeds were being planted; that his eyes were being opened.\n\nThe simple reality is that, after his conversion, dates didn't really matter all that much to Lewis. Surprised by Joy is a narrative of an unexpected and transformative encounter between God and an awakening soul. For Lewis, the really important thing was that God encountered him in the world of time and space - not the precise moment when this happened. Even if he could remember when that was."
