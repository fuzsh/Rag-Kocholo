        "text": "Clive Staples Lewis was a writer and theologian, most famous for creating The Chronicles of Narnia. He was born in east Belfast in 1898 and later attended Campbell College, a historic private boys’ school that’s still in use today.\n\nIn 1916 he was awarded a scholarship at Oxford University and, after completing his studies, went on to work there as a professor. Throughout his lifetime CS Lewis wrote over 40 books including fictional novels and Christian apologetics. Many of his works are still known and read worldwide today.\n\nBut perhaps the most famous of his works were The Chronicles of Narnia, a fictional series written for children that deals the Christian themes. The trilogy was adapted into three films: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in 2005; Prince Caspian in 2008 and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in 2010.\n\nThough buried in Oxford following his death in 1963, CS Lewis’ legacy lives on in Belfast. Uncover the man and the stories that touched the world right here in the east of the city."
