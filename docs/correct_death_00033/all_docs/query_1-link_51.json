        "text": "At long last The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III is now in print and I am devouring every page. I'm a bit of a slow reader so I am only on page 375 of this 1810 page book!\n\nI have been reading the letters of C. S. Lewis in dribs and drabs for ages. I think I started with Letters to an American Lady back in the 70's, followed by the spiritually nutritious letters to Sheldon Vanauken reprinted in A Severe Mercy. Then I received Letters to Children as a college graduation gift from a close friend. Years later I plowed through The Letters of C. S. Lewis as edited by Warren Lewis and later revised by Walter Hooper. Maybe a dozen years ago I retraced the steps of Lewis's lifelong friendship with Arthur Greeves as I read that collection of letters, originally entitled: They Stand Together. Then came the Latin Letters to Don Giovanni Calabria displaying, not only Lewis's great skill at writing fresh letters in a dead language, but Lewis's heart for true ecumenicity.\n\nBy that time I had really become a serious student of Lewis and eagerly anticipated the release of the first volume of the Collected Letters. In God's providence I was blessed to purchase that first volume while in Oxford in the summer of 2000. I enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea with Walter Hooper in his home, coincidentally on my birthday, and Walter graciously signed that first volume for me.\n\nDuring that same visit to Oxford I had the chance to read some of Lewis's original letters in the Bodleian Library. I had anticipated doing more research until I discovered how difficult some of Lewis's letters were to decipher, and unfortunately I had too many other things on my agenda during that visit to Oxford to spend too much time in the Bodleian. But those brief perusals of Lewis's original handwritten letters gave me a deep appreciation for the almost lifelong work of Walter Hooper, collecting, deciphering and typing up the massive correspondence which Lewis kept throughout his life.\n\nHere are several gems from Volume III . . .\n\nOn Elizabeth Anscombe: \"The lady is quite right to refute what she thinks bad theistic arguments, but does this not almost oblige her as a Christian to find good ones in their place: having obliterated me as an Apologist ought she not to succeed me?\" p. 35.\n\nOn Death: \"Thank you for your letter which is one of the most useful I have ever received. It brings home to me that aspect of Death which is now most neglected--Death as a Rite or Initiation Ceremony. And certainly something does come through into this world, among the survivors, at the time and for a little while after.\" p. 47.\n\nOn Writing: \"Ink is a deadly drug. One wants to write. I cannot shake off the addiction.\" p. 57.\n\nOn Fame: \"I am going to be (if I live long enough) one of those men who was a famous writer in his forties and dies unknown--like Christian going down into the green valley of humiliation. Which is the most beautiful thing in Bunyan and can be the most beautiful thing in life if a man takes it quite rightly--a matter I think and pray about a good deal. One thing is certain: much better to begin (at least) learning humility on this side of the grave than to have it all as a fresh problem on the other.\" p. 150.\n\nOn Love: \"The great thing in friendship as in all other forms of love is, as you know, to turn from the demand to be loved (or helped or answered) to the wish to love (or help or answer).\" p. 237.\n\nOn Henry James: \"A phantasmal man, who had never known God, or earth, or war, never done a day's compelled work, never had to earn a living, had no home & no duties.\" p. 239.\n\nOn Politics: \"As you know public affairs seem to me much less important than private--in fact important only in so far as they affect private affairs.)\" p. 251.\n\nOn Newspapers: \"But don't send me any newspaper cuttings. I never believe a word said in the papers.\" p. 252.\n\nOn one's childhood home: \"'Nothing is great or small except by position' and the house one grows up in has always a certain immemorial grandeur in one's mind.\" p. 262.\n\nOn Ireland: \"In Ireland I stayed at a lonely bungalow last summer which the peasants avoided not because a ghost had been seen near it (they didn't mind ghosts) but because the Good People, the Faerie, frequented that bit of coast. So apparently ghosts are the least alarming kind of spirit.\" p. 264.\n\nOn Grief: \"I am indeed sorry to hear about your Mother. In a way you were most fortunate to have had her so long (mine died when I was a little boy), yet in another way it probably makes it worse, for you have lived into the period when the relationship is really reversed and you were mothering her: and of course, the more we have had to do for people the more we miss them--loving goes deeper than being loved. But it must be nice for her. Getting out of an old body into the new life--like stripping off tiresome old clothes and getting into a bath--must be a most wonderful experience.\" p. 308.\n\nOn the Narnia books: \"It's fun laying out all my books as a cathedral. Personally I'd make Miracles and the other 'treatises' the cathedral school: my children's stories are the real side-chapels, each with its own altar.\" p. 314.\n\nHow to read the Bible: \"Supposing (as I think is the case) that sound critical reading reveals different kinds of narrative in the Bible, surely it wd. be illogical to conclude that these different kinds shd. all be read in the same way? This is not a 'rationalistic approach' to miracles. Where I doubt the historicity of an O. T. narrative I never do so on the ground that the miraculous as such is incredible. Nor does it deny 'a unique sort of inspiration'; allegory, parable, romance, and lyric might be inspired as well as chronicle.\" p. 319.\n\nOn Mercy & Justice: \"I'd sooner pray for God's mercy than for His justice on my friends, my enemies, and myself.\" p. 323.\n\nOn Reason & Desire: \"A man's reason sees perfectly clearly that the resulting discomfort and inconvenience will far outweigh the pleasure of the ten minutes in bed. Yet he stays in bed: not at all because his reason is deceived but because desire is stronger than reason. . . . what we need is not--or not only--re-education but repentance, God's forgiveness, and His Grace to help us to do better next time.\"\n\nOn Television: \"Like you, we haven't got a set, and don't propose to get one; it is I think a very bad habit to develop. People who have sets seem to do nothing but go into a huddle over them every evening of their lives, instead of being out walking, or in their gardens.\" p. 350.\n\nSo many priceless gems, and I am still only on page 375! I hope these tidbits whet your appetite to partake of the rest of the feast enclosed in this massive monument to an epistolary giant.\n\nLabels\n\nArthur Greeves In light of recent developments in the United States on the issue of gay marriage, I thought it would be interesting to revisit what C. S. Lewis thought about homosexuality. Lewis, who died in 1963, never wrote about same-sex marriage, but he did write, occasionally, about the topic of homosexuality in general. In the following I am quoting from my book, Mere Theology: A Guide to the Thought of C. S. Lewis . For detailed references and footnotes, you may obtain a copy from Amazon, your local library, or by clicking on the book cover at the right.... In Surprised by Joy , Lewis claimed that homosexuality was a vice to which he was never tempted and that he found opaque to the imagination. For this reason he refused to say anything too strongly against the pederasty that he encountered at Malvern College, where he attended school from the age of fifteen to sixteen. Lewis did not rate pederasty as the greatest evil of the school because he felt the cruelty displa\n\n\"Now Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods. For moods will change, whatever view your reason takes. I know that by experience. Now that I am a Christian I do have moods in which the whole thing looks very improbable: but when I was an atheist I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable. This rebellion of your moods against your real self is going to come anyway. That is why Faith is such a necessary virtue: unless you teach your moods 'where to get off', you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound atheist, but just a creature dithering to and fro, with its beliefs really dependent on the weather and the state of its digestion. Consequently one must train the habit of Faith.\" Mere Christianity Many years ago, when I was a young Christian, I remember seeing the graphic illustration above of what C. S. Lewis has, here, so\n\nThe final two days of our C. S. Lewis Tour of Ireland & England were spent in London. Upon our arrival we enjoyed a panoramic tour of the city that included Westminster Abbey. A number of our tour participants chose to tour the inside of the Abbey where they were able to view the new C. S. Lewis plaque in Poets' Corner. Though London was not one of Lewis' favorite places to visit, there are a number of locations associated with him. One which I have noted in my new book, In the Footsteps of C. S. Lewis , is Endsleigh Palace Hospital (25 Gordon Street, London) where Lewis recovered from his wounds received during the First World War.... Not too far away from this location is King's College, part of the University of London, located on the Strand, just off the River Thames. This is the location where Lewis gave the annual commemoration oration entitled The Inner Ring on 14 December 1944.... C. S. Lewis occasionally attended theatrical events in London.\n\nOn December 21, 2015, the following headline appeared in the International Business Times: “Bethlehem Christmas 2015 Cancelled”. To be fully accurate, religious celebrations of Jesus’ birth went forward last year in Bethlehem, but many of the secular celebrations of Christmas that usually surround it were toned down due to instability in the area. Looking back a decade, there was even one year when Christian Arabs canceled community celebrations of Christmas in support of the Palestinian uprising. However, the Jewish government would have no part of that, so the Israeli military sponsored its own holiday celebrations in the area. It is also interesting to note who celebrated the first Christmas and who didn’t. The first Christmas was not celebrated by the emperor Caesar Augustus, nor Quirinius, the governor of Syria, nor was it celebrated by the lowly innkeeper. But Christmas was celebrated by a few lonely shepherds along with Joseph and Mary and the angels of heaven. How\n\nWhen I solicited questions to be addressed in this series, a member of the congregation wrote this to me: “Animals are mentioned in the Bible as beasts of burden and sacrificial animals. Is there any mention of treating animals with kindness?” The short answer to that question is: yes. However, it is important to note that what the Bible says about caring for animals comes in the midst of a great narrative. It is a narrative of Creation, Fall, and Redemption. Let’s look at these three great acts in the narrative play of world history one by one. First, let’s look at creation. Creation At the very beginning of the Bible, in the book of Genesis, chapter 1, verses 26 through 28, we read this: Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the\n\nA friend's blog written yesterday ( http://wesroberts.typepad.com/ ) got me thinking about C. S. Lewis's experience of the church. I wrote this in a comment on Wes Robert's blog: It is interesting to note that C. S. Lewis attended the same small church for over thirty years. The experience was nothing spectacular on a weekly basis. For most of those years Lewis didn't care much for the sermons; he even sat behind a pillar so that the priest would not see the expression on his face. He attended the service without music because he so disliked hymns. And he left right after holy communion was served probably because he didn't like to engage in small talk with other parishioners after the service. But that life-long obedience in the same direction shaped Lewis in a way that nothing else could. Lewis was once asked, \"Is attendance at a place of worship or membership with a Christian community necessary to a Christian way of life?\" His answer w\n\n\" I keep thinking about the Christmas scene that Anthony arranged under the altar. This probably is the most meaningful \"crib\" I have ever seen. Three small woodcarved figures made in India: a poor woman, a poor man, and a small child between them. The carving is simple, nearly primitive. No eyes, no ears, no mouths, just the contours of the faces. The figures are smaller than a human hand - nearly too small to attract attention at all. \"But then - a beam of light shines on the three figures and projects large shadows on the wall of the sanctuary. That says it all. The light thrown on the smallness of Mary, Joseph, and the Child projects them as large, hopeful shadows against the walls of our life and our world. \"While looking at the intimate scene we already see the first outlines of the majesty and glory they represent. While witnessing the most human of human events, I see the majesty of God appearing on the horizon of my existence. While\n\nA good crowd gathered at the White Hart Cafe in Lynchburg, Virginia on Saturday, February 7 for a powerpoint presentation I gave on the life and work of Sheldon Vanauken. Van, as he was known to family and friends, was best known as the author of A Severe Mercy , the autobiography of his love relationship with his wife Jean \"Davy\" Palmer Davis. While living in Oxford, England in the early 1950's, Van and Davy came to faith in Christ through the influence of C. S. Lewis. Van was a professor of history and English literature at Lynchburg College from 1948 until his retirement around 1980. A Severe Mercy tells the story of Davy's death from a mysterious liver ailment in 1955 and Van's subsequent dealing with grief. Van himself died from cancer in 1996. It was my privilege to know Van for a brief period of time during the last year of his life. However, present at the White Hart on February 7 were some who knew Van far better than I did--Floyd Newman, one of Van&\n\nGlenmerle in the 1950s In 2013 I published a biography on one of my favorite authors, Sheldon Vanauken. If you are interested, you can learn more and/or purchase a signed copy here: Signed Copy or an unsigned copy here: Amazon . One of the things that got me writing the book was my search for the location of Glenmerle, Vanauken's childhood home, so lovingly described in his book, A Severe Mercy . A visit to Van's alma mater, Staunton Military Academy, alerted me to the fact that Van grew up in Carmel, Indiana. Then, with the help of a local historian, we identified the location of Glenmerle. Because Van had suggested, in my first conversation with him, that Glenmerle was destroyed, I naturally assumed that the house no longer existed. However, another one of Van's fans recently contacted me to let me know that she believed she had found Glenmerle still in existence. I was able to look up the house on a real estate web site and compare current interior photos o"
