Wade Center regarding C. S. Lewis' faith after Joy's death, and more. His essay titled A GRIEF OBSCURED addresses some of our questions about C. S.

Join us for this fascinating discussion.\n\nIf you forgot to tune in last week, we heard again from Douglas Gresham, Joy‚Äôs son, about his life as Lewis‚Äôs stepson and beyond. These interviews have inspired me and I hope they do the same for you. As we learn more and more about Joy and Jack‚Äôs fascinating life, we dive deeper into our own stories.\n\nEach of these episodes begins with Joy‚Äôs startlingly beautiful poetry, so tune in!\n\nWe‚Äôve had thousands of downloads, and I am so grateful to all of you for listening and spreading the word.

Lewis‚Äôs stepson, Douglas Gresham has a distinctly unique perspective on the love story that transpired between the two writers. Gresham shares with Patti his first years of knowing and meeting Lewis and explains how Joy and Lewis‚Äôs correspondence, romance, and marriage affected the entire Gresham family.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nOctober 8, 2019\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN PART II\n\n‚ÄîWith Douglas Gresham (after Joy's cancer)\n\nWhen Douglas Gresham first learned of his mother‚Äôs cancer diagnosis, he very clearly heard the Lord say, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt make it, if you really can‚Äôt make it without your mother, I can fix it. All you have to do is ask.‚Äù Joy Davidman‚Äôs cancer later went miraculously into remission and gave her, her two children, and Lewis four more blissful years before fatally returning. In this episode, Douglas takes Patti through the years following his mother‚Äôs death and shares how her cancer diagnosis not only changed him but also changed the people whom he learned to call family.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nOctober 15, 2019 LOSING FAITH\n\n‚ÄîDid Lewis lose his faith after Joy‚Äôs death?\n\nWith Dr. David Downing\n\n‚ÄúNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear,‚Äù C.S. Lewis writes in his raw and beautiful book, A Grief Observed, which chronicled his heartbreak after losing his wife, Joy Davidman, to cancer in 1960. Many have read this text and have interpreted that Lewis might have lost his Christian faith after losing Joy. Patti joins Dr. David and Crystal Downing in Wheaton College‚Äôs Marion E. Wade Center to discuss how this grief impacted Lewis, his future writing, and ultimately, his Christianity. She discusses the fascinating essay ‚ÄúA Grief Obscured‚Äù by Dr. David Downing.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nOctober 22, 2019\n\nWHY JOY?\n\n‚ÄîWhy did Lewis choose Joy Davidman? Dr. Crystal Hurd and Dr. Crystal Downing\n\nOne of the questions that Patti asked while writing Becoming Mrs. Lewis was: Why Joy? Why was Joy Davidman the woman who finally ended Lewis‚Äôs long run as a bachelor? Patti speaks with Dr. Crystal Downing about how Dorothy Sayers introduced Lewis to an appreciation of brilliant, fiery women who bristled against cultural gender expectations. In another conversation, Dr. Crystal Hurd gives insight on how Lewis‚Äôs mother, Flora Lewis, also paved the way to Lewis finding his soul mate in the feisty Joy Davidman.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nOctober 29, 2019\n\nMUSE AND CO-AUTHOR\n\n‚ÄîJoy as Lewis‚Äôs muse andco-Author with Andrew Lazo\n\nTill We Have Faces, a retelling of the ancient story of Cupid and Psyche, is often hailed as one of C.S. Lewis‚Äôs most mature and sophisticated novels. In fact, Lewis himself credits the title as being one of his best books. Patti speaks with scholar Andrew Lazo about how Till We Have Faces was heavily influenced‚Äîand arguably cowritten‚Äîby wife Joy Davidman and how Lewis‚Äôs other works show Davidman‚Äôs literary fingerprint.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nNovember 5, 2019\n\nTHE LOST LOVE SONNETS\n\n‚ÄîJoy‚Äôs poetry to C.S. Lewis with Dr. Don W. King\n\nOver 300 poems by Joy Davidman were never published during her lifetime and were, in fact, lost until quite recently. Dr. Don King has edited, analyzed, and published them in his book Yet One More Spring: A Critical Study of the Works of Joy Davidman. During their compelling conversation in this episode, Patti and Don discuss how Joy‚Äôs poetry reveals her desires, persistence, and even her pain. Together, they also ask: Did Joy give Lewis these poems? And how do these poems reflect their love story? Quite racy in parts, Joy‚Äôs desire and love for Lewis is palpable in these lost sonnets.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nNovember 12, 2019\n\nSUPRISED BY LOVE\n\n‚ÄîHow love found C.S. Lewis with Andrew Lazo\n\nA once-proclaimed ‚Äúconfirmed bachelor,‚Äù C.S. Lewis found himself contradicted when he fell in love with Joy Davidman. However, it is up for debate WHEN Lewis discovered this deep love for Joy. Scholar Andrew Lazo discusses how the letters and works of C.S. Lewis showcase his evolving self-awareness as he realized that he had helplessly fallen in love with the imperious Joy Davidman.\n\nView Episodes\n\nBehind the Scenes Media PDF\n\nJoy & Patti üì∫ In the News\n\nArticle: BECOMING JOY\n\nLove Magazine UK\n\nBECOMING JOY: She was crossing the Atlantic to meet a pen pal she'd never seen . . .\n\nSunday Short Story by Author Patti Callahan Sept 29, 2019 Love Magazine UK.
