As we remember the birthday anniversary of the celebrated author C.S. Lewis (b. November 29th, 1898), it’s fascinating to contemplate how the city of Oxford’s character is built on these figures from the past. Playwrights, authors, and poets who have lived here, amongst its dreaming spires, have described its happenings in various states of reality, providing a virtual tour of this city’s lanes and lodgings, with factual and fictional anecdotes.

From the connection of the fantasy world of Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland to Christ Church College, to centuries-old pubs where famous writers used to meet, the invented and true histories of literary Oxford, the myths and legends associated with those who lived here, are part of this city's remarkable identity and heritage.

By the mid-20th century, C.S. Lewis had reached the ranks of various literary behemoths of Oxford, while being most well-known for his illustration of The Chronicles of Narnia, which has sold over 100 million copies worldwide, with the most famous being The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.

But how did this historic city of academia establish such a long-lasting impact on C.S. Lewis as a literary giant? How did it lead him to create a fantastical masterpiece that has entertained generations after him?

C. S. Lewis in Oxford

Despite being born in Ireland, Lewis attended a preparatory school in Malvern, Worcestershire, which developed in him a fascination for European mythology and the occult.

Lewis joined the University of Oxford in 1917, where he studied Classics and English at University College. However, shortly after joining, he enlisted in the Officers’ Training Corps at the University and was shipped as part of the British Army to France to fight in the First World War.

As the war came near its end, upon his return to Oxford in 1920, Lewis’ academic talents began to shine through. He achieved top marks in all his examinations, earning a First in Honour Moderations (Greek and Latin literature), one in Greats (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1922, and his final First in English in 1923.

Shortly after finishing his finals, Lewis was appointed as a Philosophy Tutor at University College, a position he held for just one year before being elected as a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College in 1925. Enthralled by his role, writing, and the academic inspirations of Oxford, Lewis served in this position for 29 years.

His academic career made him not only a novelist but also an essayist, poet, and theologian. Lewis had a mercurial relationship with Christianity in his earlier life, but he later became a firm Christian apologist. The resemblance of the lion, Aslan’s story, for example, to the life of Christ, demonstrates Lewis making Christian themes such as the sins and redemption of humanity accessible to a young audience.

During his time in the city, he also became great friends with another author, J.R.R. Tolkien. The pair became close friends, forming a group of famous Oxford writers known as ‘the Inklings.’ Tolkien had a huge influence over Lewis’ work, especially on themes of redemption and religion. It is said that the two could often be seen huddling over Christian texts or Middle Earth manuscripts in the Eagle and Child Pub on St. Giles Street!

How Oxford Influenced C. S. Lewis’ Chronicles of Narnia

During the early to mid-twentieth century, C.S. Lewis and his fellow Inklings (which included Tolkien, Nevill Coghill, Lord David Cecil, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, and Warren Lewis) would regularly meet at the famous Eagle and Child Pub on St. Giles Street to read each other’s writing, discuss modern and classical literature, and share ideas on religion, theory, and modern politics to influence their work.

Between them, the group were unknowingly re-inventing the fantasy genre, revitalising the way we perceive and read medieval literature today. And C.S. Lewis, in particular, really drew on the influence of the city around him to transform Oxford into a fantastical portal to other marvellous worlds.

His world-famous literary creation The Chronicles of Narnia can be seen all over the city of Oxford, where he allegedly drew on the centuries-old buildings, monuments, and cobblestone streets to create an extraordinary world of fantasy.

Lewis enters our topographical mythology most prominently in St. Mary’s Passage, just off the High Street. The story goes that Lewis burst out of the western doors of St. Mary’s Church on a cold winter's night, where he purportedly had his own rooms, and indeed where he gave the war-time sermon “The Weight of Glory.”

It was here, while pausing to catch his breath on a cold winter’s night, that he came face to face with a certain door which leads into Brasenose College. The image of which formed the elements for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

As you can see from the inset photographs, the door centrepiece features a maned, lion-like face carved into the wood, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Aslan we are familiar with.

The side of the door frame is flanked by two faun gargoyles - part human and part goat - who play the flute and guard the intricate animal wood carving. In the first book, we’re introduced to fauns as the servants of Aslan. In particular, the faun, Mr. Tumnus, is the first creature that Lucy encounters upon entering Narnia.

Slightly further ahead to the right, marking the entrance to the beautiful Radcliffe Square, there stands a solitary lamp post. As we know from the books, the lamp post is the marker which leads us into the world of Narnia from our reality and also is used as the beacon to lead the characters back home.

These elements, as the legend would have it, spawned the creation of Narnia, and some of the prominent features of its most famous book. The lamp post, for example, marks the entrance to the magical kingdom, while Aslan, the Lion and arguably its deity, and Mr. Tumnus, is the friendly faun who helps Lucy Pevensie, one of the child protagonists.

Is the speculation true? Who knows. There are, after all, many lamp posts and lion symbols dotted in and around the city. But, to see it all encompassed within the ethereal setting of Radcliffe Square, it seems too coincidental (and beautifully placed), to feel like there’s some truth in the speculation.

“This is the land of Narnia,' said the Faun, 'where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea.”
