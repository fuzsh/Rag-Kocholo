        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- On the morning after Christmas, a small group of mourners stood silently at the grave of former President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nStaff from his presidential museum on Monday, Dec. 26, placed a wreath and flowers at the graves of Ford and his wife, Betty, located on the Grand Rapids museum's grounds.\n\nThe short, solemn ceremony marked the 10th anniversary of the death of the nation's 38th president.\n\nFord died on Dec. 26, 2006, at the age of 93 at his home in Rancho Mirage, California. The causes of death listed on the subsequent death certificate were arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and cardiac arrest.\n\nHis age at the time of his death made him the longest-living president in history, surpassing Ronald Reagan by 45 days.\n\nThough members of Ford's family were not able to attend Monday's ceremony in Grand Rapids, Ford's oldest son, Michael Ford, expressed thanks to members of the community, state and nation for their thoughts and prayers.\n\n\"Though my siblings and I are sure to shed tears on this day, we know Dad's and Mom's legacies live on among us,\" Ford said. \"On this day our families will prayerfully and privately remember the many good times we shared together with Dad and Mom.\"\n\nMarty Allen, chairman emeritus of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation, took part in the planning of Ford's funeral 10 years ago and served as an honorary pallbearer in Washington D.C. and Grand Rapids.\n\nAllen said Dec. 26 should serve as a reminder of the legacy left by Ford.\n\n\"I think people have learned -- a lot of people that didn't know him -- have learned about his values and his characteristics, maybe reinforced by the recent campaign,\" he said. \"It wasn't very attractive to people -- and then they learned about his [Ford's] traits, and how humble he was, and how he put the country before his own political endeavors. That's pretty important that people recognize that.\"\n\nJoe Calvaruso, executive director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation, suggested the date is a good time to reflect on President and Mrs. Ford's impact on Grand Rapids, and on the nation as whole.\n\n\"With the redone museum that was opened earlier this year, it's a time for people to come down and pay their respect,\" Calvaruso said. \"I think, part of, when he passed away the funeral was an opportunity for people to know and understand the impact President Ford had on our country. So I encourage everybody to come down and learn and understand more about President Ford in the weeks to come.\"\n\nFord was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska, as Leslie Lynch King Jr. He and his mother, who divorced Ford's father soon after his birth, moved to Grand Rapids. The future president later took his stepfather's name of Gerald R. Ford.\n\nPrior to being sworn in as president, Ford was an Eagle Scout, a University of Michigan football player, football and boxing coach, a Yale Law School graduate, a Grand Rapids attorney, an officer in the U.S. Navy, a World War II veteran, a husband and father of four, a 13-term congressman and briefly served as President Richard M. Nixon's vice president.\n\nHe succeeded Nixon as president following the 37th president's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.\n\nFord carries the unique distinction of being only person the history of the United States to have served as both Vice President and President without being elected to either office.\n\nTo learn more about Grand Rapids' president or to pay your respects at his grave site you can visit the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, located at 303 Pearl St. NW in Grand Rapids.\n\nIf you're in the Ann Arbor area, a visit to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, located at 1000 Beal Avenue, yields a rich body of archival materials connected to Ford's presidency."
