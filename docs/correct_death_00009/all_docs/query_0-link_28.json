Or the possibili ty at the time may of existed the law in all probability did not even ha ve a definite suspect. But moving along in time to 1951 when my age was do ubled to 12 years old the holdup event surfaced again - but this time it w as learned that a family member was involved in the 6 year old case!\n\nExactly when the story broke open in the newspapers remain unknown at th is time to me but on Friday, June 1, 1951 the headline of the Dayton Jour nal Herald was one newspaper that carried the story. The notable headli ne was titled \"Woman Identifies Dayton Man As Killer In 1945 Holdup\" (unqu ote). I am certain the Dayton Daily News also carried the story too in a ddition to other area newspapers. Also the Battlecreek, Michigan newspap er may of had a story on this date and know they did for the Saturday, Ju ne 9, 1951 edition.\n\nAgain, I was basically shielded from a lot of the details but it surfac ed at our house on one evening when being visited by relatives and my d ad Marshall was angry making some very strong comments in regards to the s tory in the newspaper and related events in 1951. Folks with one excepti on that is essentially all that was ever heard over all these years - sin ce 1951 and that was 55 years ago.\n\nAlso I recall that some of our close relatives who were also kids ne ar my age back then seemed to only know a brief part of the event to o. We had discussed some of this over the years and we all seemed to ju st draw shaded memories with no details. Then someone sent me a very sho rt news article a few years ago that only covered a brief segment of how t he story broke open apparently in 1951.\n\nNow in 2006 more information has been discovered and found in some newspap ers as it was indicated in the above paragraphs of this email. Hopefully s omeone will come forward who knows more of the story or has other news por traying the holdup event? I do not know nor ever did hear what the outco me was in the end.\n\nThe basics of the story as I know it to this point. First the names in the news and otherwise are listed as:\n\n1. The alleged gunman - Ace Ellsworth Maggard (Maggart ?) also referr ed to as Ellsworth Maggart or Tex Maggart. In 1951 approximately 32 ye ar old house painter. Resided at 3715 McCall Street (Ave. ?) in Dayton, O hio. Maggart had apparently been arrested in 1935 as a juvenile burglar a nd auto thief. He was picked up again in 1947 and later released. The ne ws item also reflected prior to the current arrest he had lived in the sta te of Washington until a few months ago. Ace had been going with (datin g) Alberta Evilsizor for around 3 months.\n\n2. My sister (half-sister) Alberta Creasman age 24 of Battlecreek, Michig an. I believe she was only around 18 years of age and not married when t he crime occurred in 1945 at which time her name would of been Alberta Evi lsizor.

Or the possibili ty at the time may of existed the law in all probability did not even ha ve a definite suspect. But moving along in time to 1951 when my age was do ubled to 12 years old the holdup event surfaced again - but this time it w as learned that a family member was involved in the 6 year old case!\n\nExactly when the story broke open in the newspapers remain unknown at th is time to me but on Friday, June 1, 1951 the headline of the Dayton Jour nal Herald was one newspaper that carried the story. The notable headli ne was titled \"Woman Identifies Dayton Man As Killer In 1945 Holdup\" (unqu ote). I am certain the Dayton Daily News also carried the story too in a ddition to other area newspapers. Also the Battlecreek, Michigan newspap er may of had a story on this date and know they did for the Saturday, Ju ne 9, 1951 edition.\n\nAgain, I was basically shielded from a lot of the details but it surfac ed at our house on one evening when being visited by relatives and my d ad Marshall was angry making some very strong comments in regards to the s tory in the newspaper and related events in 1951. Folks with one excepti on that is essentially all that was ever heard over all these years - sin ce 1951 and that was 55 years ago.\n\nAlso I recall that some of our close relatives who were also kids ne ar my age back then seemed to only know a brief part of the event to o. We had discussed some of this over the years and we all seemed to ju st draw shaded memories with no details. Then someone sent me a very sho rt news article a few years ago that only covered a brief segment of how t he story broke open apparently in 1951.\n\nNow in 2006 more information has been discovered and found in some newspap ers as it was indicated in the above paragraphs of this email. Hopefully s omeone will come forward who knows more of the story or has other news por traying the holdup event? I do not know nor ever did hear what the outco me was in the end.\n\nThe basics of the story as I know it to this point.\n\nFirst the names in the news and otherwise are listed as:\n\n1. The alleged gunman - Ace Ellsworth Maggard (Maggart ?) also referr ed to as Ellsworth Maggart or Tex Maggart. In 1951 approximately 32 ye ar old house painter. Resided at 3715 McCall Street (Ave. ?) in Dayton, O hio. Maggart had apparently been arrested in 1935 as a juvenile burglar a nd auto thief. He was picked up again in 1947 and later released. The ne ws item also reflected prior to the current arrest he had lived in the sta te of Washington until a few months ago. Ace had been going with (datin g) Alberta Evilsizor for around 3 months.\n\n2. My sister (half-sister) Alberta Creasman age 24 of Battlecreek, Michig an.
