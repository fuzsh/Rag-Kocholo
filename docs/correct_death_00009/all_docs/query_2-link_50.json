        "text": "Originally named Leslie Lynch King, Jr., Gerald Ford was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska. His parents divorced soon after his birth. His mother, Dorothy Gardner King, moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, and married Gerald Rudolph Ford. The elder Ford adopted the boy and gave him his name. The younger Ford attended the University of Michigan, where he was a star football player. In 1941 he earned a law degree from Yale University.\n\nFord joined the U.S. Navy in 1942 and served in World War II. After the war he returned to practicing law. In 1948 Ford married Elizabeth Anne Bloomer. They had four children.\n\nA Republican, Ford was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1948. He served in the House of Representatives for 25 years. In 1973 Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned after being charged with not paying taxes and other crimes. President Nixon named the popular and honest Ford as Agnew’s replacement.\n\nAfter Nixon resigned in 1974, Ford was sworn in as president. Ford tried to turn the attention of the nation away from the Watergate scandal. He granted Nixon a full pardon for any crimes that he might have committed as president. The pardon angered many people. Many also opposed Ford’s pardons of men who had avoided military service during the Vietnam War.\n\nFord tried to stop rising prices and unemployment, but he could do little to help the poor economy. Twice in September 1975 people tried to assassinate him. Secret Service agents stopped one shooter; the other shooter missed."
