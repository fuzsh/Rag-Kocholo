Sparks - March 30, 1961 - April 25, 2024\n\nDeparted: 04/25/2024 (St. Maries)\n\nObituary Preview: Joseph Edward Sparks was born on March 30, 1961, in Portland. He grew up in Eugene with his parents, Dean and Pearl Lewman. At the age of 8 was gifted with a brother, Derrick, whom he adored. His childhood was spent with his amazing cousins who always remained close, his aunt, to whom he referred as, \"my big sis,\" and his grandparents who loved their \"Joey\" beyond words. He had many fond memories with his grandpa Bill, learning everything there was to know about fishing and hunting, and ultimately, they got his first buck together. Joe attended North Eugene High School where he loved to play baseball. In 1982, he moved to Lewiston after visiting his close friend, Jack. He was drawn to the area's rugged mountains that were fit for hunting, and the river right at his fingertips that would allow for years of fishing. He felt a deep connection to the area, later finding out that his great-great-grandparents had been laid to rest there many years before. In 1984, he married and had two daughters, Jolene and Jessica. He included his girls in everything that he loved. Together they enjoyed camping, hunting for morel mushrooms at their secret spots, fishing and frequent trips to the Oregon Coast where he planned the biggest fishing trip they would have. He continued to make us laugh through his witty use of movie quotes back and forth, up until the end. He was a loving father. He had a passion for hunting and fishing and enjoyed great times with friends from Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming and had the stories, pictures and trophies to show for it. He took pride in his beautifully landscaped yard and growing, harvesting and cooking from his garden. He was always ready for a good western movie, sitting around a bonfire like his grandma Bessie loved to do, or spending time with his eight grandchildren: Diesel, Madi, Paige, Lexy, Kamara, Bronson, Francesca and Raquel. Papa Joe loved them all so much. His last 21 years were spent with his fiancé, Sheryl. Their best times together were spent on the boat or camping. Joe passed away on Thursday, April 25, 2024, after health struggles were ultimately too much for his body, but in true Joe form, he fought until the end. He will be deeply missed. Joe’s service will be held in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nMichael R. Bebee - April 30, 1944 - April 21, 2024\n\nDeparted: 04/21/2024 (St. Maries)\n\nObituary Preview: Michael R.

Enjoying the simplicity of life, Barb had few wants and found joy in most things; especially her loyal companion Rosie and her granddaughter McKaylah. If you couldn’t find her tending to her garden, cooking up something she had dreamt about, or simply reading a book on her swing, you could always count on finding her up the Joe taking in everything outdoors in our area.

Shirley grew up in Potter Valley, CA graduating from Potter Valley High School with the class of 1957. Following high school, she married Kenneth Cook in June of 1957. The couple made their home in Colorado for a few years before returning to Potter Valley. Raising a family, Shirley stayed home to take care of her children for a few years. She then worked as a waitress and a cook in restaurants. Later, she went to cook for the local hospital, nursing home, school, jail, and prison. Cooking for people was Shirley’s love language and she doted on anyone she cooked for. Her marriage to Kenneth ended in divorce, but Shirley was blessed with true love when she met and married Ray Williams on December 22, 1992. They were soulmates and the best thing that had ever happened to each other. Ray’s work took the couple to Weiser, ID where Shirley went to work for the prison between Weiser and Ontario, OR. To most this would seem a big scary prison, but to Shirley, they were extra kids that she would take care of and feed. The inmates loved her and looked at her as a mom; she watched out for them, and they would watch out for her. After 5 ½ years in Weiser, Ray and Shirley moved to Orofino where she again went to cook at the local prison. She spent 5 years there before her and Ray decided to move to St. Maries, ID. Life in St. Maries was semi-retirement for Shirley. She went to work part time for the Benewah County Jail again cooking for inmates. She joined the Community Presbyterian Church and fell in love with her church family. They were amazing to her, and she was a blessing to them help cooking for bazaars and holiday dinners. When Shirley wasn’t cooking for someone, she enjoyed being on the water, fishing, crossword puzzles, gardening, and canning. Pickled asparagus was a favorite as was the Kokanee they caught. She loved to crochet, and each family member was gifted homemade gifts such as hats, blankets, dolls, and potholders. Most importantly, Shirley’s family was everything to her and she loved them all dearly. She was one of a kind and will be missed by anyone who knew her. Shirley is survived by her children Melvin (Colleen) Cook of St. Maries, ID, Kevin (Tina) Cook of Athol, ID, Larise (Andy) Bailey of St. Maries, ID; step-children Michael (Susan) Williams of Lakeport, CA, Tim (Shawn) Williams of Willits, CA, and Debra Deason of Astoria, OR; 16 grandchildren, 13 great grandchildren; numerous nieces and nephews.

He was born on December 1st, 1946, in Oroville CA. Steve grew up around the Stonyford, Elk Creek and Willows area. One of his favorite high school memories he shared was of the day he skipped school to go fishing and Field and Stream Magazine were in the area doing a story and took a picture of him with the fish he caught. The picture ended up on the cover of the magazine, and needless to say, he got caught for skipping school. After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Army where he was in the 101st Airborne 87th division. Steve served in Vietnam and was honorably discharged in 1969 and found himself in North Carolina where he received his electrical certificate from Johnson College of Technology. He met the love of his life Jean in Fayetteville, NC and after 2 weeks of dating the couple married on November 29, 1969.

He was born to Fred and Gertrude Barden on July 9. 1945 in Hurley, WI. Bill grew up in St. Maries attending school there. He left school to go work in the woods, and at the age of 21 he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Bill served in Vietnam and was honorably discharged in 1969. He returned to St. Maries and went back to work in the woods. In 1980 he married Kathleen Conley and the couple had 2 children. He bought a self-loader and established his own logging company. Bill logged all over North Idaho and ran his logging company for many years before the industry became busy and flooded with more loggers looking for work; creating a very competitive market for small gypo loggers. He then went to work for Jack Buell, driving trucks and running machines, ending his career running a Processor in 2004. Sadly, Kathy died in 2011; however Bill later found companionship and friendship with Harriet McCall. In retirement, Bill enjoyed being in the woods and would cut firewood as a hobby. He also enjoyed attending auctions and riding his side by side. He and Harriet would camp and pick huckleberries all over, including trips to Southern Idaho and Utah; she was good at keeping him busy. Time at his cabin up the St. Joe was by far one of his most favorite things to do, and when he was able, he liked to hunt. Matlock and watching Westerns were his favorite things to watch on tv, but don’t let him fool you, he was also a huge Judge Judy fan! Most importantly, he loved spending time with his grandchildren Jada and Jaysen and following them around in their sporting events. Bill is survived by his children BJ and Tracy Barden and Nicole Barden all of St. Maries; siblings David and Tonia Barden of Washington and Suzanne Kerby of St. Maries; grandchildren Jada and Jaysen Barden of St. Maries; and close friend Harriet McCall of Fernwood.

He was born to Albert “Louie” and Jean Welch on January 24, 1947 in Yreka, CA. Don grew up in Weed, CA where he excelled as an athlete, being inducted into his high school’s Hall of Fame for Basketball, Football, and Track & Field. He graduated from Weed High School with the class of 1964. Following high school, Don earned a football scholarship to Oregon State University. He spent 2 years there as an Art Major. Following college, he moved to Portland, OR where he went to work for Union Carbide. It was there he met Cyndie Brown, and the couple dated several years before marrying on June 3, 1971 in a beautiful back yard ceremony at her parent’s home in Portland. The couple made their home in Portland, adding four daughters to the family. Don was provided with an opportunity to expand the Union Carbide company in the early 1980’s and moved the family to West Virginia. After two years there, the family moved to Lakehead, California. The family lived in a cabin in the woods and lived simply off of the land. Don hunted and fished for food alongside raising rabbits, chickens, and ducks. He had a talented green thumb and could grow the biggest and best garden you had ever seen. Don was a gifted carpenter; he helped to remodel and build homes for several years before he was hired by R&R Leisure Craft to build house boats. He designed and built the “fly bridge” which was a steering station allowing the driver to steer the boat from the rooftop. This was a first of its kind and is still in use today. After 15 years with R&R, he decided to change his career path by beginning employment with Shasta Nursery building green houses and serving as their handy and maintenance man. At the same time, Cyndie ran a day care out of their home, and Don helped with the cooking and transportation of the children in her care. The family grew by one additional daughter. Don retired in 2011. He and Cyndie moved to St. Maries, ID and helped their daughter and son in-law with their business “The Pines Motel”. To keep busy in retirement, Don continued to help friends and family using his extensive carpentry knowledge and skills. Together, Don and Cyndie ran the Book Shack where he could visit with the patrons who quickly became friends. Don never knew a stranger and had the gift of gab. An avid outdoorsman, Don enjoyed everything the outdoors had to offer, specifically hunting, fishing, and picking morel mushrooms and huckleberries; he knew the backroads of California and Idaho very well, and had many favorite spots for hunting, fishing and picking. He was active as a coach when his children played sports, and enjoyed following his grandchildren when they also became involved in sports. He loved to read and enjoyed American history, art, painting, creating, sculpting, and carpentry. To say he will be missed by friends and family is an understatement, he has left a void in his family’s hearts. Don is survived by his wife Cyndie at their home in St. Maries; children Dawn (Mark) Alves of Red Bluff, CA, Kellie (Kevin) Hofmaister of Moscow, ID, Nicole (Steven) Raymond of Red Bluff, CA, Lindsey Welch of Redding, CA, and Jordann (Darryl) Welch of St. Maries, ID; sister Susie (Dwight) Hammond of Burns, OR; 8 grandchildren; 2 great-grandchildren; numerous nieces and nephews.
