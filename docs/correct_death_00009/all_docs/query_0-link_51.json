Paul was born on August 1, 1951 in Kewanee, IL as the 6th of 12 children of Joseph Patrick and Majella Catherine (Harty) Colgan. On July 7, 1988 Paul married Phyllis Fairchild in Maui, Hawaii, she survives. Also surviving is their daughter Megan (Kyle) Wiggins, and granddaughters Zoe Lauren Wiggins and Rae Elizabeth Wiggins, all of Scottsdale, AZ. A background in journalism laid the foundation for Paul’s 50 year career in Public Affairs. After earning a degree in Government from the University of Notre Dame where he proudly played tuba in the marching band, Paul was a state government reporter in Springfield, IL. He wrote for the Chicago Daily News and then covered political issues in Illinois and Missouri for the Herald-Whig in Quincy, IL. Paul’s expansive knowledge and keen insight on public policy allowed for a successful transition from reporter to the legislative staff of the Illinois General Assembly. In this role, Paul was instrumental in crafting extensive legislation that served the people of Illinois. It was also during his time in Springfield that he earned a master’s degree in Public Affairs Reporting from the University of Illinois-Springfield. His passion for politics was equal to his vigor for the fight in political campaigns. Paul worked in professional staff roles on dozens of campaigns at the local and state levels ranging from Governor to Mayor of the City of Chicago. His “get it done” attitude was infectious, and transformational in every campaign he staffed. Paul became a consultant and lobbyist representing the interests of clients in real estate, building code, technology, finance, energy, and agriculture industries at the local, state, and national levels. As government affairs director for the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, he represented the interests of business and commercial consumers during the Illinois Electric Utility Deregulation legislative efforts in the 1990s. As a government affairs consultant to the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago, Paul worked on rewriting the Chicago Energy Conservation Code, and served on the City of Chicago Building Decarbonization Working Group, where he helped compile recommendations for decarbonizing the built environment and reducing carbon emissions in Chicago. With an entrepreneurial spirit, Paul founded EA Americas, LLC, a consulting firm focusing on climate and environment, social, and governance issues for those in real estate. Paul also assisted with the formation of BONI USA, a technology startup that provided navigation services to the visually impaired community. Paul also served as the government affairs consultant for the Building Industry Association of Greater Chicago, and was active on various National Association of Home Builders committees dealing with energy, environment, building codes, zoning, and other related residential development issues. Being involved with energy and environmental-related issues for more than 25 years, Paul was most recently a Senior Strategist with Strategia Consulting in Chicago and was heading up the Clean Energy Coalition—a group recently formed to protect all Illinoisans’ consumer rights and the environment. A trusted mentor and generous advisor to others, Paul was chosen by his peers to serve as President of the Chicago Area Public Affairs Group. He was also community minded from his long-term residency in Wheaton and Glen Ellyn, he is a former chairperson of the Arts Commission in Wheaton, IL. A 1969 graduate of Wyoming Community High School, he was quite active in sports and other extracurricular activities. He was an unabashed supporter of the University of Notre Dame University and Notre Dame football. Paul was eager to share a story that usually featured a hearty and jovial laugh. In true Irish spirit, he was quick to make friends, widely accepting of others from all walks of life, and loved a spirited debate. Professionally, his word was his bond and the industries he served and colleagues he worked with thrived due to his counsel. Paul was regarded for his ability to reason and analyze situations from multiple angles. For him, an ideal outcome for all those involved was more important than “being right”. He took pride that his democrat friends thought he was republican, and his republican friends thought he was democrat. Although ‘doing work that had purpose and meaning’ was a cornerstone pillar of his identity, his family came first. Being a fully engaged, committed, and loving husband, father and grandfather was a sacred duty and the greatest joy of his life. Paul was always positive, supportive of any endeavor, and immensely proud of his family. He had a quiet sense of self-assurance with a loud, jolly, social side, and was very quick to say, “it’s ok to make mistakes, just make the small ones”. Paul is also survived by nine siblings: Judith (Robert) Curran, Elmwood, IL; Joanne (Gene) Gill, Wyoming, IL; Timothy (Patty) Colgan, Wyoming, IL; Colleen Colgan, Burlingame, CA; Jane (John) Francis, McCall, ID; Susan (Ken) Knapp, Henry, IL; Martin (Sue) Colgan, Hermitage, TN; Gregory Colgan, Rancho Mirage, CA; and Thomas (Gloria) Colgan, Sausalito, CA. He was uncle to over 70 nieces and nephews, and was preceded in death by his parents, and brothers Patrick J Colgan and Dr. Philip L Colgan. A private funeral service with family will be held on Saturday, April 27, 2024, at St. Dominic’s Catholic Church in Wyoming, IL, and burial will follow at St. Dominic’s Cemetery, Wyoming. There will be a memorial celebration of Paul’s life at a later date in Chicago. Details on the Celebration, as well as any donations to a charity of the family’s choice, will be made available at a later date.

It is often published in a newspaper, online obituary platform, or funeral home website to inform friends, family, and acquaintances of the deceased's passing.\n\nWhy are obituaries important?\n\nObituaries serve as a way to honor and celebrate the life of the deceased, while also providing essential information to those who need to know about the passing. They offer a sense of closure and allow loved ones to share their grief with others.\n\nWho typically writes an obituary?\n\nIn most cases, the obituary is written by a family member, close friend, or funeral home staff.

They will work with you to correct the mistakes and republish the revised version.\n\nWhat is a memorial donation in lieu of flowers?\n\nA memorial donation is a charitable contribution made in memory of the deceased instead of sending flowers.

Some websites also offer paid access to historical records.\n\nCan I reuse an obituary on social media or other websites?\n\nCopyright laws may apply to published obituaries. Always obtain permission from the original publisher or author before sharing or reposting an obituary on social media or other websites.\n\nWhat is a celebration of life?\n\nA celebration of life is an event held to honor and remember the deceased, often featuring stories, photos, music, and other personal touches. It may take place instead of or in addition to a traditional funeral service.\n\nHow do I plan a memorial service?\n\nWork with a funeral home or event planner to organize a memorial service.
