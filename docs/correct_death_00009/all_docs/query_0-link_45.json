        "text": "Pre-Hispanic contacts and cultural continuity between the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico have commanded the interest of archaeologists since the earliest work in the region. Many of the founders and early practitioners of archaeological research in the Southwest, such as AV Kidder, Emil Haury, and Earl H. Morris, also spent time working in Mesoamerica. It was natural that they considered cultural continuity to extend over the international border into Mexico. Between the two world wars, EB Sayles (1936), Walter W ...\n\nMichael Schiffer redefined archaeology as the use of material culture to study human behavior. This definition established modern material culture studies and has promoted creative archaeological studies of the contemporary world that extend beyond Behavioral Archaeology. But the Modernist Project writ large often leads to devastation, and the United States-México border wall is one material example. The wall has failed to create an impregnable border but rather has generated material debris. Contemporary ruins on both sides of the border in Ambos Nogales, Arizona and Sonora, exemplify the destruction both caused and hidden by the wall.\n\nThis paper explores a question that has long perplexed Southwest archaeologists regarding the roles played by indigenous foragers and migrant farmers in the spread of maize agriculture to the Colorado Plateau during the Early Agricultural Period, beginning ~2000 BCE. Drawing upon linguistic, archaeological, and rock art evidence, we build an argument suggesting that southern Uto-Aztecan speaking people who practiced corn agriculture migrated from the Tucson Basin-Borderland area into the territory of the historic Hopi Indians in northeastern Arizona, something supported in part by Hopi ethnohistoric accounts that identify certain clans as coming from south of the Hopi country. Evidence suggests that during the Basketmaker II period (~800 BCE to 400 CE), these immigrant farmers came into contact with ancestral Hopi foragers. The interaction between these immigrant farmers and indigenous foragers became the basis of Hopi culture, the spread of corn agriculture, and the archaeological complex known as Western Basketmaker II culture.\n\nRecent scholarship has shown how aggressive policing along the US–Mexico border and in the interiors of the United States and Mexico has heightened migrants’ vulnerability to violence, death, displacement, and exploitation. Here, we explore how migrants engage in social practices to respond to state violence along an extended and militarized migrant trail. We show how migrants form part of a broader landscape of sociopolitical contestation with organizations, cartels, local communities, and state agencies, wherein they generate new forms of sociality and strategic cooperation to promote their survival and well-being. Migrants’ social practices illustrate that, far from eroding migrant agency, heightened state violence has generated new and creative social strategies to survive, and at times resist, aggressive policing measures.\n\n\"Peopling America has caused linguistic, social and cultural changes that also extend to rock art. The linguistic perspective is not usually applied to approach this topic, although it can be extremely informational. To understand human development, internal and external sources are required. One external source is that of paintings in rock shelters which allow an ethnolinguistic interpretation as well as the opportunity to investigate the fragmentation of American Indian (Amerindian) languages and their contact with Indo-European languages. The internal sources are those of the linguistic structures of languages and facts from their analysis. Nevertheless, the question: “what can a linguist do in archaeological research?” --except translating, naturally-- is always present. The incursions of archaeologists in Linguistics, Colin Renfrew, for instance, are however normally justified. In this paper I’ll present some lines of research, and even some results, based on linguistic –or philological—tools, which might clarify some archaeological and historical issues. Keywords: Amerindian, Anthropomorph, Archeology, Areal, Corachol, Diachronic, External Linguistics, Huichol, Migrations, Mythology, Peripheral, Phylum, Pictograph, Rock-Art, Uto-Aztecan, Variation. La ocupación del territorio americano por el hombre ha producido cambios lingüísticos, sociales y culturales que se pueden percibir en el arte rupestre. Pese a sus posibilidades, la Lingüística no se aplica normalmente al estudio de este asunto, que requiere el uso de fuentes internas y externas. Una de las fuentes externas es la pintura rupestre conservada en una serie de viseras o refugios y que se presta a una interpretación etnolingüística al mismo tiempo que permite estudiar la fragmentación de las lenguas indoamericanas y su contacto con las indoeuropeas. Las fuentes internas comprenden las estructuras lingüísticas de las lenguas y los hechos derivados de su análisis. Siempre se repite la pregunta sobre cuál es el papel del lingüista en la investigación arqueológica (dejando a un lado la traducción). En cambio, las incursiones de los arqueólogos, como Colin Renfrew, en la Lingüística se ven como justificadas. En esta contribución se presentarán varias líneas de investigación, e incluso algunos resultados, basadas en instrumentos lingüísticos o filológicos, que pueden clarificar varios aspectos arqueológicos e históricos. Palabras clave: Amerindio, Antropomorfo, Areal, Arqueología, Arte Rupestre, Corachol, Diacrónico, Huichol, Lingüística Externa, Migraciones, Mitología, Periférico, Phylum, Pictógrafo, Yuto-Azteca, Variación. \""
