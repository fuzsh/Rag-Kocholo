        "text": "Gerald J. Ford (born 1945) is a successful Texas banker known for buying and selling thrift banks. Ford bought his first bank in 1975 for $1.2 million and later sold it for a profit of $80 million.\n\nOne of Ford's most successful transactions occurred in 2002 when he sold California-based Golden State Bancorp to Citigroup for $6 billion; his personal stake is now worth more than $1.1 billion.\n\nFord has been a member of the SMU Board of Trustees since 1992. He is chair of the board's Finance Committee and a member of its Executive Committee, Trusteeship Committee, Committee on Athletics and Executive Committee of the Campaign for SMU. He also currently serves as co-chair of the Dedman College Campaign Committee and on the Executive Board of Dedman School of Law. He is a former member of the Executive Boards of Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, Edwin L. Cox School of Business, John Goodwin Tower Center for Political Studies and Willis M. Tate Distinguished Lecture Series.\n\nFord is former chair of the board and chief executive officer of Golden State Bancorp Inc., headquartered in San Francisco. It was a holding company for the nation's second largest thrift institution and California's fourth largest bank. He also is board chair and CEO of Liberté Investors Inc., an investment firm. Described as a quintessential entrepreneurial banker, the West Texas native began his banking career by purchasing a number of small banks in rural areas of the state.\n\nFord's other investments include the auto-finance company AmeriCredit and 120,000 acres (486 km²) of rangeland in New Mexico.\n\nGerald J. Ford was raised in Pampa, TX and graduated from Pampa Senior High School before attending Southern Methodist University. He would later donate the money to build the new football stadium at SMU, and it was subsequently named after him; the Gerald J. Ford Stadium. During his school days in Pampa, TX, he spent many hours helping his father, Coyle, at Ford's Paint and Body Shop.\n\nExternal links"
