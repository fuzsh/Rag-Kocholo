        "text": "Vail – To the rest of the world, he was Mr. President.\n\nTo many people in the Vail valley, however, he was simply Jerry.\n\nGerald Ford brought the “winter White House” to Vail and placed the developing ski town on the map by regularly schussing down the slopes. He was considered a friend and regular guy by many here, even while lending his name to innumerable local causes in his role as “mountain royalty.”\n\n“We look at everything we’ve done here, and we see his footprints in all of that,” said Ceil Folz, president of the Vail Valley Foundation, a charitable organization for which Ford served on the board of directors for years. “He’s literally part of the fabric of this community.”\n\nWhether attending an annual summer barbecue at a local ranch – toting a bowl of potato salad – or hosting a black-tie gala in support of the American Skiing Classic, the former president, who died Tuesday at age 93, always considered Vail a comfortable and comforting place.\n\n“We love it. We built a house up there in Beaver Creek, and our children and grandchildren join us up there at Christmas and in the summer,” he said in an October 2004 interview with The Denver Post. “It’s a nice environment, winter or summer.”\n\nVail was the retirement home for Ford when he was not ensconced in his desert home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., or back visiting his home state of Michigan. Growing up in Michigan, Ford was an Eagle Scout and University of Michigan football star. He was elected to serve 13 terms in Congress and established his presidential library in the state where he grew up.\n\nVail captured his eye\n\nIt was Vail where Ford created a spectacle as he gleefully raced down the ski slopes, a phalanx of Secret Service agents and noodle-legged reporters in tow. And it was Vail where he sought solace after losing the 1976 election, surrounding himself with family and dear friends.\n\n“It’s too bad that not more people voted for him, because he was a great person,” said Pepi Gramshammer, one of Ford’s closest friends in the area and a native Austrian who became a U.S. citizen just to vote in the election. “We supported him here.”\n\nIn Vail, Ford garnered 1,220 votes to Jimmy Carter’s 261.\n\nGramshammer’s wife, Sheika, in fact, headed the state re-election committee that helped Ford carry Colorado while being defeated nationally by Carter amid a Watergate backlash.\n\n“I don’t even think of him as the president. I think of him as my friend, a wonderful human being who happens to be the president of the United States,” she said in 2004.\n\nAn avid skier, then-Congressman Ford and his wife, Betty, first came to Vail with their children for Christmas in 1968.\n\nFord wrote in the foreword to June Simonton’s book “Vail: Story of a Colorado Mountain Valley” that he was “impressed with the beauty of the Colorado Rockies.”\n\nTwo years later, the Fords bought a modest three-bedroom condominium in the Lodge at Vail, borrowing money from their children’s life-insurance policies for the $50,000 unit.\n\nEven after President Nixon appointed Ford to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president, Ford continued to vacation in Vail and hit the slopes, albeit surrounded by a sizable entourage of staff and security.\n\nRegular guy, loves to ski\n\nAt times, Ford even purchased his own lift tickets at the walk-up window, just like any other tourist. At others, his presence required elaborate plans, including specially groomed and closed runs. He was sometimes accompanied by his personal physician, Navy Rear Adm. William Lukash, who appropriately was nicknamed “Crash.”\n\nOnce, an eight-minute shutdown of the Vail gondola – with the sitting vice president suspended 100 feet above the ground – became cause for great consternation.\n\nFord often joked that, as his three sons, Steve, Jack and Michael, and daughter, Susan, got older, it became more difficult to keep up with them on the ski slopes.\n\n“I have to keep reminding them that there was a time when I used to pick them up out of the snowbanks,” he said in 1973.\n\nDuring the heat of the presidential campaign, Ford’s press secretary, Ron Nesson, scolded the media for disseminating photos of the president – an accomplished skier but a renowned klutz – after a tumble in the snow.\n\nFord, however, laughed it off.\n\n“Every skier takes a fall once in a while,” he said. “There are more skiers that fall down than stand up.”\n\nIn 1975, Ford was waving to well-wishers on the slopes and didn’t see an empty lift chair coming his way. Grazed by the chair on the backside, the president was pulled aside at the last moment by Secret Service Agent Larry Buendorf, the same bodyguard who had deflected the gun aimed at Ford by would-be assassin Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme a few months earlier.\n\nFord learned to ski at a small Massachusetts ski area while attending Yale law school in the late 1930s. He continued taking lessons from the Vail ski school until a chronic bad knee forced him to give up the sport in 1984.\n\nAfter he became president, Ford’s condo was deemed inadequate for security reasons and certainly not large enough to accommodate his entourage of staff and advisers. He began spending the holidays at the private slopeside chalet of Dick Bass, a Vail Associates board member and owner of the Snowbird ski area in Utah.\n\nOne Christmas week, as the temperature outside plunged to minus 28, the furnace went out in the house, prompting an emergency Christmas Eve service call to local plumber Bill Burnett.\n\n“When I got the heat going late that night, he wanted to come down to see the guy who saved his vacation,” recalled Burnett, now retired but still living in the area. “We had some cookies and some coffee. … He and I became friends.”\n\nIt was that “regular people” attitude, more than anything else, that endeared Ford to his neighbors in Vail. His number has been listed in the Vail phone book for years, and he regularly went out of his way to meet the normal people along his path.\n\nOn one visit, longtime resident Joe Staufer told Ford at one encounter: “My parents will die when they find out they missed you.” The next day, a Secret Service agent knocked on his door to say that Ford was playing golf and he would like to meet the elder Staufers.\n\nIn retirement, the Fords regularly attended the annual potluck picnic hosted by Beaver Creek horse wrangler Steve Jones, the former president bringing along a bowl of potato salad.\n\nFord created headlines in Colorado again in 1990, when he wrote an impassioned letter to then-President George H.W. Bush in a rare lobbying effort to kill the controversial Two Forks reservoir proposal for the South Platte River.\n\nSolid imprint on town\n\nToday, Ford’s moniker graces the town’s main municipal park and popular outdoor amphitheater; he drew international leaders and top-tier celebrities to Vail for his World Forum and golf and ski competitions; and his contributions of cash and character proved instrumental in bringing the prestigious World Alpine Ski Championships to the ski area in 1989 and 1999.\n\n“I don’t know where we’d be without them,” Folz said. “The Vail valley is unbelievably lucky to have someone of his stature who is so committed to the community.”\n\nFrom speaking to the Vail Rotary Club while serving as vice president of the United States in 1973 to giving the keynote address to the Colorado Cattle Feeders Association in his retirement in 1985, Ford was keenly interested in being a good neighbor.\n\n“They’ll attend homeowners association meetings, just like everyone else, get up to speed on what the snowplowing situation is,” Folz said.\n\nFord joked with reporters at one point that he would gladly give up his job as president to serve as justice of the peace in Eagle County.\n\nFord took the ceremonial first shovel of dirt out at the groundbreaking for Beaver Creek, Vail Resorts’ luxury ski development, in July 1977. He later bought a single lot there for about $300,000 – then a near-record price in Colorado – and the family moved into a tasteful home in 1983.\n\nIn the summers, it was not unusual to see the former president and his wife dining with friends in one of Vail’s upscale restaurants, and each December, Ford threw the switch on the lights for the Vail Christmas tree.\n\n“Betty and I, our children and our grandchildren are always thrilled to come to Vail to celebrate Christmas and the New Year,” he said at the annual event in 2000. “We love it here.”\n\nStaff writer Steve Lipsher can be reached at 970-513-9495 or slipsher@denverpost.com."
