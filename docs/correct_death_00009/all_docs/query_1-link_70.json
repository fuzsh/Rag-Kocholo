        "text": "Gerald Ford served as president for more than two years\n\nFormer US President Gerald Ford has died aged 93.\n\nLast month he became the longest-living US president when he reached 93 years and 122 days, passing the record held by Ronald Reagan.\n\nMr Ford was never elected president. He took office after Richard Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal in 1974 but lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976.\n\nPresident George W Bush paid tribute to Mr Ford, a fellow Republican, praising his \"integrity and common sense\".\n\nGerald Ford was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and lived with Betty, 88, at Rancho Mirage, about 130 miles (210km) east of Los Angeles in southern California.\n\nThe former president suffered ill health this year and he was taken to hospital four times for tests and angioplasty. He suffered a stroke in 2000.\n\nHis life was filled with love of God, his family and his country\n\nBetty Ford\n\nA statement from Betty Ford said: \"My family joins me in sharing the difficult news that Gerald Ford, our beloved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, has passed away at 93 years of age.\"\n\nThe statement did not give the cause of death.\n\nIn a message from the White House, President George W Bush said he was \"greatly saddened\" at the news.\n\n\"With his quiet integrity, commonsense and kind instincts, President Ford helped heal our land and restore public confidence in the presidency,\" Mr Bush said.\n\n\"Our 38th president will always have a special place in our nation's memory.\"\n\nPresident Reagan's wife Nancy also paid tribute to a \"dear friend and close political ally\".\n\n\"His accomplishments and devotion to our country are vast, and even long after he left the presidency he made it a point to speak out on issues important to us all.\"\n\nVietnam War\n\nGerald Ford was the only US president never to win a national election.\n\nHe was chosen as Richard Nixon's vice-president in 1973, when Spiro Agnew resigned amid corruption charges.\n\nFord succeeded Nixon and brought honesty to the White House\n\nMr Ford then succeeded to the top office when Nixon became embroiled in Watergate - the scandal over a break-in at the offices of the rival Democratic party in Washington in 1972.\n\nThe attempted bugging of the building was linked to officials in the Nixon White House, and the cover-up went all the way to the top.\n\nOn taking office Mr Ford declared the \"national nightmare\" of the Nixon scandal over but soon after he revived the debate by controversially granting his former boss a pardon for any crimes committed as president.\n\nAnalysts believe in the short term it may have cost him the 1976 election, but in the long term the decision has been seen as astute.\n\nMr Ford was in office as the US accepted its defeat in the Vietnam War, with the fall of Saigon in April 1975.\n\nHe said it was time to \"bind up the nation's wounds\".\n\nThe opposite of Nixon, Gerald Ford was praised for his openness, sunny disposition and most important, his honesty.\n\nWife Betty became a national figure in her own right, crusading against drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nFollowing his stroke, Gerald Ford slipped further from the limelight.\n\nHowever, he did join Jimmy Carter, George Bush Snr and Bill Clinton at a memorial shortly after the 11 September attacks in 2001.\n\nHe was also at the funeral of Ronald Reagan in June 2004."
