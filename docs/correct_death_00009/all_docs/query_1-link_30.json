        "text": "Gerald R. Ford became the 38th President of the United States when he succeeded to that office following the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. He served as President until 1977, when he was succeeded by President Jimmy Carter. Previously, Ford represented Michigan’s 5th District in the House of Representatives beginning in 1949 until his nomination to the Vice Presidency by President Nixon in 1973, following the resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. While in Congress, Ford served on the House Appropriations Committee and rose to the position of House Minority Leader. He also served on the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nFord as President\n\nOne month after taking office as President, President Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, which came to be known as the most controversial action of his three year presidency. While he presided over an economy with growing inflation and a recession, he was able to reduce the Federal deficit for the first time since the end of World War II. In foreign policy, he made efforts to strengthen allies while minimizing confrontation with adversaries.\n\nKey actions during his presidency included forming the Economic Policy Review Board in 1974 to oversee all economic policy, signing the Privacy Act of 1974 protecting Americans’ individual privacy rights, and signing the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 which established special education throughout the United States.\n\nPresident Ford remained active in his retirement serving on boards of major corporations as well as opening the Betty Ford Clinic with his wife to support research, treatment and rehabilitation for alcoholism. In 1999, He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor awarded to individuals making an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\n\nPresident Ford died on December 26, 2006, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 93. At the time of his death, he was America’s oldest ex-president.\n\nKey Legislation During the Ford Administration\n\nAnnouncing a Program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters\n\n88 STAT. 2504.
