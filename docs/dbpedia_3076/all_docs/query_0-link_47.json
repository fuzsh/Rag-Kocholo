        "text": "When HBO Max debuted in May 2020, subscribers rightfully expected (and got) the formidable catalog of prestige television associated with the HBO brand. But its movie library drew from a much deeper well. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, is a huge conglomerate, and its premiere streaming service comprises decades of titles from Warner Bros., Turner Classic Movies, Studio Ghibli and more. Viewed in that light, its recent rebranding as Max seems fitting.\n\nThat means a lot of large-scale fantasy series and selections from the DC extended universe. Max is also an education in Golden Age Hollywood classics and in independent and foreign auteurs like Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray and John Cassavetes. The list below is an effort to recommend a diverse range of movies — old and new, foreign and domestic, all-ages and adults-only — that cross genres and cultures while appealing to casual and serious movie-watchers alike. (Note: Streaming services sometimes remove titles or change starting dates without notice.)\n\nHere are our lists of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video and the best of everything on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ (2000)\n\nArriving after a decade in which Hong Kong action movies gained a foothold in cult circles and among Hollywood imitators, Ang Lee’s “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” built a bridge between East and West, introducing English-speaking audiences to Chinese martial arts tradition through a stirring art-house period piece. Comparing it to an earlier Lee film, Elvis Mitchell called it “‘Sense and Sensibility’ with a body count.” The Hong Kong icons Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi lead this wire-fu/romance hybrid about the disappearance of the fabled Green Destiny sword in early 19th century China and the hunt for the mysterious thief who whisked it away.\n\nStream it on Max\n\n‘Minari’ (2020)\n\nIn this evocative indie drama from the writer-director Lee Isaac Chung, drawn from his own childhood, a family of Korean immigrants moves to rural Arkansas in 1983 to develop a modest plot of fertile land into a source of Korean vegetables, which can then be sold to vendors in Dallas. But the road to even this modest success is trying for Jacob (Steven Yeun), Monica (Han Ye-ri) and their two children, who have to adjust to deeply unfamiliar terrain while caring for Monica’s mother (Youn Yuh-jung), who has come from overseas to join them. Though leavened by plenty of fish-out-of-water comedy, “Minari” digs into the unique hardships of first-generation immigrants who are carving out the smallest of places for themselves in America. A.O. Scott called it “moving and downright revelatory.”\n\nStream it on Max\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
