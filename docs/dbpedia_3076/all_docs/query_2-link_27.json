        "text": "Forgive me; I’m a bit assertive in this post. It’s taken a lifetime to get to the point where I could tackle one of the least popular tenets of my faith.\n\nWe believe in a diviner destination for humankind, more than most of our Christian counterparts. In short, we believe that the worthy and willing soul can eventually attain godhood.\n\nThis article probably addresses other Christians curious about this topic or even detractors of my faith – as much as it does my fellow Latter-day Saints. I hope you enjoy the effort made here to speak up.\n\nPsalm 82\n\nI have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. (Psalms 82:6)\n\nA good number of Christian scholars will explain this verse away. What I mean by that is, quite frankly, their answer concludes you are not of such regal DNA (god with a small g) and that the verse doesn’t mean what it says. Plus, you are not an actual child of the Highest. You’re a garden-variety, garden-level creation. Instead, they say, ‘children’ is only “symbolic.”\n\nTheir answers sometimes include doctorate-level religious theory and re-interpretation, but their accounts dance around what the verse directly says. I have included several verses below, much like Psalms 82:6 – and they get the same treatment.\n\nLet me paraphrase the repeating pattern I encounter with those who object to our uncomplicated acceptance of Psalm 82:6. It goes something like this,\n\n“This doesn’t resonate with what I’ve been taught, so I’m going to alter its narrative by inserting myriad definitions and concepts not found in the Bible. The verse can mean almost anything else, but I won’t accept the straightforward message it cites. Oh, and by the way, you’re not a Christian because you accept what it says.”\n\nWe Believe That Verse\n\nLatter-day Saints believe in our divine heritage (God is the Father of our spirits) and in eternal progression after this life. We believe that eventually, someday, humankind may rise to god-level stature in the eternities – if we do our part.\n\nThat belief is unique and unpopular with other Christian sects. A fair number of us have encountered snide and condescending remarks scoffing at such an idea. Sometimes people even yell about it.\n\nWhy is that? It’s in their scriptures repeatedly.\n\nThey Did The Same to Jesus\n\nJesus took heat for a similar idea. The Jews were ready to stone him, and in response, he cited Psalms 82:6 or some similar verse:\n\n33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.\n\n(Note: Of course, I would not make any of us the equal to Christ, but there are a few Christians who attempt to kill our faith stone dead – because we believe in a diviner destination for humankind than they do.)\n\n34 Jesus answered them, Is it not **written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\n\n35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the ***scripture cannot be broken;\n\n36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? (John 10:33-36)\n\n**written in your law: established as doctrine in your scriptures\n\n***scripture cannot be broken: is irrefutable\n\nIf I could paraphrase that episode in today’s language, the exchange would go something like this:\n\nJesus: I’ve done so many good works for you; why would you want to stone me?\n\nJews: It’s not about good works; you claimed you are the Son of God. That’s not allowed; now we’re going to stone you.\n\nJesus: But that statement is not a crime; it’s in your scriptures. It even says you are gods. If the word of God calls you gods, how can you be offended when I say I am the Son of God, which is even less of a statement?\n\nIn His Image\n\nCite Genesis 1:26-27 to various Christian scholars and see how much they alter it from its clear-cut message. Sometimes, they explain God doesn’t have a face (I find this particularly sad) – therefore, that’s not what the verse means.\n\n26 ¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\n27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n\nimage: copy, model, portrait, picture, likeness\n\nlikeness: depiction, replica, reproduction\n\nLatter-day Saints believe in these verses’ simple, powerful, beautiful message. God is the Father of our spirits. We are made in His regal image and patterned after Him. We bear His spiritual DNA and we have an important destiny.\n\nCome Sit With Me On My Throne\n\nThis is my favorite one to cite on this topic. These verses give me so much hope and motivation.\n\n20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\n\n21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. (Revelation 3:20-21)\n\nSuch a tender and extraordinary invitation from our dear Jesus Christ. Our divine destiny is to overcome the world and to overcome our fallen natures. It takes work and effort. It takes making progress and upward movement. It takes “overcoming.” It takes his grace and atonement all along the way.\n\nWe believe exactly what these verses say.\n\nPaul touches on these same concepts when he says:\n\n16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:\n\n17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. (Romans 8:17)\n\nsuffer with him: take up the cross, forward His kingdom on the Earth, bear the shame of the world, repent as needed and let His atoning grace heal you.\n\nDo You Read the Bible Cover-to-Cover?\n\nMost people know a few flagship Bible verses and aren’t familiar with the rest. The problem is that the interpretations of those few verses can be immensely evolved and distant from their original meaning when you don’t have all the verses to guide you. It is not uncommon for some Christians to be quite surprised by what hundreds of other Bible verses say that don’t back up their understandings.\n\nWhen we read the Bible back-to-back, the verses shed light on each other, making their meanings much easier to discern. The line of interpretation is straighter and cleaner.\n\nI invite you to become a better Bible scholar and learn more about God’s word for yourself. The Spirit delights in teaching and testifying. I make it a point to read the Bible cover-to-cover (straight through) every eight years. I have read it this way at least half a dozen times. I reread parts of it regularly. It is a relevant and beautiful text of scripture. It is God’s word.\n\nFree Bible\n\nIf you go to this site, missionaries will share an uplifting message when they hand-deliver a copy (King James Version). Or you can read or listen online, and they’ll visit with you virtually.\n\nTakeaway\n\nI hope these verses shared today give you hope and lift your spirits. They certainly do mine!"
