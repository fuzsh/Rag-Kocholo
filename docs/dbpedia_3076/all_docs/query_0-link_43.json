through, but many leaders within the party thought differently.\n\n>> It is a stunning and historic development... >> NARRATOR: Through years of interviews... >> The culmination of a half century in public life, the very last decision he would make, would be to surrender.\n\nOf course, that’s painful.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Now on FRONTLINE, Biden’s Decision.\n\n♪ ♪ >> It's been this roller coaster of days.\n\nThe president of the United States, who's under enormous pressure to drop his bid for a second term, ends up being sick and has to isolate.\n\nHe has COVID.\n\nHe disembarks from the plane.\n\nHe takes a couple of steps and then he just stops, inexplicably, for no reason, it seems like.\n\nAnd he looks over to the right, where, there's nobody there.\n\nAnd he just looks halting, unsteady, uncertain.\n\nAnd you saw the lowest point, in some ways, of his presidency.\n\n>> (shouting over jet hissing): Any response to Chuck Schumer?\n\n>> (inaudible) (reporters shouting questions) >> He disappears into the presidential limousine, and that's the last time anybody sees Joe Biden for six days.\n\n>> He was self-isolating for health reasons, but politically, he was incredibly isolated because there were mounting calls for him to drop out of the race.\n\nPeople were wondering, is this the end of Joe Biden's political career?\n\nPeople were looking at that imagery.\n\nThey were looking at the days ahead, the weekend that was coming up, as a pivotal moment in determining whether or not Biden would be able to remain as the leader of the Democratic ticket.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Sick and on the political ropes, President Joe Biden faced a critical decision.\n\n>> He was getting the message from lawmakers on Capitol Hill who were saying, \"If you don't make a decision this weekend, \"we are going to come out en masse and say that we have lost confidence in you.\"\n\n(sirens blaring) >> NARRATOR: It would be one of the toughest of his life.\n\n>> There was no more room for error.\n\nHe had to decide whether or not he was going to step down as a candidate.\n\nWas there one more comeback there for him to mount?\n\n>> NARRATOR: For Joe Biden, it was a pivotal moment in a lifetime marked by ambition, tragedy, and determination.\n\n>> You can't understand Joe Biden without understanding the insecurities at the core of his being.\n\nThose insecurities that are born out of the stutter, born out of the bullying, they're the diesel fuel that keeps pushing him forward.\n\n>> An automobile accident killed the wife and baby daughter of Biden of Delaware.\n\n>> He went from being on top of the world to being a young widower, a father of two children, and a man with a broken heart.\n\n>> Hello, everybody.\n\n>> When he was accused of plagiarism, we felt that his character was being attacked, and it sort of took us back.\n\n(crowd cheering) >> When you get knocked down, you get back up!\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> You cannot understand Joe Biden without understanding everything that came before, which is an entire lifetime spent proving to people that he can do the things that they believe he cannot.\n\n♪ ♪ (train bell clanging) >> NARRATOR: The roots of Joe Biden's enduring willpower trace back to a bygone era.\n\n>> This is the Delaware story.\n\nIt is an outstanding example of what free people in a free country can accomplish.\n\n>> When he talks about the world that he wants to see for the country, when he talks about the dignity of work, when he talks about middle-class communities, he's really going back to something that had existed in his youth.\n\n>> The fathers and mothers in our hometown are just plain, nice-living folks, the kind you read about in storybooks.\n\nYou know, Main Street folks who say, \"Hello, nice morning.\"\n\nWe've built it with civic pride and remain proud of its dignity and friendly, tolerable characters.\n\n♪ ♪ >> The family moved to Wilmington when Biden was about ten.\n\nAnd the neighborhood was, you know, this is, um, Irish Catholic, pretty much, um, working class.\n\n♪ ♪ >> My brother Joe is the eldest of all of us.\n\nYou know, we were normal kids.\n\nWe were, you know, we raised hell, we got into trouble, but once we walked outside our home, we were Bidens, and we, we had to stick together, and loyalty was tantamount-- we took care of each other.\n\n>> They have a very strong sense of a clannish identity.\n\n\"We Bidens\" is an idea-- you'll hear Val, his sister, use that term, and Joe Biden uses that term.\n\n>> Mom and Dad told us that the most important thing in life was family.\n\nMy father was not a man of many words.\n\nMy mother was the one who was the talker in the family.\n\nBut when he spoke to us, I mean, we all perked up.\n\nMy dad, my dad didn't have to say twice to us what he was thinking, or what he wanted us to do.\n\nMom stayed at home, Dad, uh, sold cars.\n\n>> Joe Biden's self-presentation is that he is a man who comes out of the working class, full stop.\n\nBut actually, the real story is richer.\n\nIt's much more complicated and interesting, which is, of course, that his father had money at one point.\n\nHis father grew up with money.\n\n>> My dad grew up well-polished by gentlemanly pursuits.\n\nHe would ride to the hounds, drive fast, fly airplanes.\n\nHe knew good clothes, fine horses, the newest dance steps.\n\n>> His father had little emblems of wealth left behind, like a polo mallet in the coat closet, and he had photographs of himself next to a private plane and things like that.\n\nAnd then they lost it all.\n\nAnd as a result, there was this sense of, almost like a phantom limb.\n\n>> He'd been knocked down hard as a young man.\n\nLost something he knew he could never get back.\n\n>> When you listen to Joe Biden, the thing that matters to him most is this sense of dignity, because he saw in his own father's life and his own family the scars that are left when you experience that kind of, that kind of precipitous drop in security, the precipitous drop in status that his family experienced.\n\n>> That value of each person's dignity, you can see that as a pretty straight line from Mr. Biden to Joe.\n\nBecause he didn't think his own dignity had always been honored the way it should be.\n\n>> There's a story that Joe Biden writes about his father, and how they go to a Christmas party, and the owner of the dealership at some point in that Christmas party tosses out a bucket full of silver dollars onto the floor.\n\nHis father was struck by all of these people scrounging around on the floor for these silver dollars.\n\nAnd so his father, in protest, quits immediately.\n\n>> It was supposed to be a kind of fun activity, but Joe Biden's father found it humiliating.\n\nJoe Biden has always had a chip on his shoulder, and that's something that he inherited from his father.\n\nHis father was always alert to the risk of being humiliated for not having as much status or influence or power or education or money as anybody else.\n\n>> \"The world doesn't owe you a living, Joey,\" he used to say.\n\nHe had no time for self-pity.\n\n>> Failure would happen in everyone's life, but giving up was unforgivable.\n\nMy dad would say, \"It's not how often you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get back up.\"\n\n>> \"Get up,\" that was his phrase, and it has echoed through my life.\n\n\"You're lying in bed feeling sorry for yourself?\n\nGet up.\n\n\"Bad grade?\n\nGet up.\n\n\"Kids make fun of you because you stutter, B-B-B-Biden?\n\nGet up.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Little Joey had a stutter.\n\n>> Hope to pea... teach P.E.\n\nWell, my... (stuttering softly) ...father is very strict.\n\n♪ ♪ >> When you're young, it... (stuttering softly) ...instantly... (stuttering softly) ...makes you a target for bullies.\n\n(stuttering softly) You're immediately not like any of the other kids.\n\n>> People feel free to make fun of stutterers.\n\nI mean, it was, uh, it was, it was difficult for my brother.\n\n>> He has talked frequently about the shame he felt and the anger he felt when his peers made fun of him for his stutter and even his teachers, the nuns who taught him.\n\n>> He had an assignment he had to memorize, and he had to stand up and deliver it in the classroom.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The words were in front of him: \"Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentleman.\"\n\n>> When Joe read it, it went, \"Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man.\"\n\n\"Say that again?\"\n\nMm.\n\n\"Sir Walter Raleigh was a gentle man.\"\n\nThis went on three times.\n\n>> He said \"gentle man\" instead of \"gentleman.\"\n\n>> The nun looked at him and said, \"Master B-B-B-Biden, do you need your classmates to tell you how to say that?\"\n\n>> It was so embarrassing and so enraging that Biden walked out of the room.\n\nHe walked out of the school.\n\nHe walked all the way home.\n\n(dog barking in distance) (car door closes, engine starts) >> NARRATOR: Joey's mom, Jean, marched him back to the school to confront his teacher.\n\n>> Mrs. Biden was a very warm, gracious person, but then she had this steely backbone if challenged.\n\nLike, if somebody did something to one of her kids, for example, I think the, the steel came out.\n\n>> The sister starts telling him how disrespectful Joe is, and my mother, \"Stop.\"\n\nShe said, \"Just tell me.\n\nDid you make fun of my son?\"\n\n\"Well, I...\" \"Sister, did you make fun of my son?\"\n\n\"Well...\" And my mother said, \"Well, I'll answer it for you.\n\n\"You sure in hell did.\n\n\"And if you ever, ever, ever do that again, \"I'm going to come back and I'm going to knock \"your bonnet right off your head.\n\nDo, do we understand each other?\"\n\n>> That was a very strong pugilistic strain in the family.\n\nThere was a very strong sense that was imparted to the kids that you will never allow yourself to be diminished by somebody else.\n\n>> He was not going to let a bully define him.\n\nHe just knew he stuttered and he was going to do something about it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: His decision was emblematic for how he'd face the many challenges to come.\n\n>> Biden... (stuttering softly) ...would stand in front of his bedroom mirror holding a flashlight to his face, and he would recite Yeats and Emerson.\n\nHe was determined to eventually be a person who could give... (stuttering softly) ...speeches.\n\n♪ ♪ >> Those insecurities that are born out of the bullying, born out of the stutter, born out of his father's fall from social mobility, those are the things that keep propelling him, they're the diesel fuel that keeps pushing him forward.\n\n>> At a pretty young age, Joe Biden awakened to the power of his own will; the will to recite these poems in front of the mirror, to beat the stutter, which seemed like this assignment from God, you know, this, this sense that he had been given this body that was frail.\n\nAnd he got through it with this act of devotion, in a sense, this devotion to himself.\n\nAnd I think it seeded in him this belief that he could, through an act of will, he could get himself to places that other people didn't think he could.\n\n(bell tolling) >> In eighth grade in Catholic schools, February was vocation month.\n\nThe priest or the nuns would come into our classroom and talk about the vocation of becoming a nun and the vocation of becoming a priest.\n\nJoe was very taken by it, and I remember his coming home to Mom and Dad and his saying, \"You know, I, I might want to be, I think I might want to become a priest.\"\n\n>> (speaking Latin) >> The Church imposed a sense of ritual, a sense of hierarchy, a sense of being part of something larger than yourself.\n\nAll of these were really this essential piece of what it meant to be a Biden.\n\n♪ ♪ >> Biden sees in the insecurities of his youth: kids making fun of him, his father messing up in business.\n\nHe has a craving for security and he finds it in these institutions that are permanent-- the Church and its thousands of years of, of ritual.\n\nThat if you master, you can build a career for yourself, a reputation, and a security for yourself, your family, your community.\n\nAnd that, to him, was enormously appealing.\n\n>> (speaking Latin) >> For a lot of boys growing up in that culture, you know, this is what you look up to, it's what you, what you aspire to.\n\nTo have a priest in the family, it's a real honor for the family.\n\nWhen you become a priest, you get all the prestige, and you get the social status, and you get the, the spiritual status.\n\n♪ ♪ >> And so Joe said, \"Maybe, you know, I'm, I'm thinking about priesthood.\"\n\nAt that time, young boys went from eighth grade, they went into the seminary at ninth grade.\n\nAnd my mom said, \"Well, it's wonderful \"if you want to be a priest.\n\n\"But there's no way in hell you're going at ninth grade.\n\n\"You go to high school, you go to college.\n\n\"And when you get out, and if you want to be a priest, \"you have my blessing.\n\n\"But you're not going in ninth grade.\n\nYou're too little to make that decision.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was in high school that Joe discovered another calling.\n\n>> When he was in high school, John F. Kennedy became the president.\n\n>> Senator John F. Kennedy, the youngest man ever voted into the White House, Mr. Kennedy is also the first Catholic chief executive in the history of the country.\n\n>> And all of a sudden, an Irish Catholic, the first Irish Catholic to reach the White House, became this enormous symbol for Biden.\n\n>> Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> The election of JFK was such a moment.\n\nMost, if not all, Democrats of his generation really were invested in the Kennedy story.\n\n>> The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans... >> JFK had talked about the torch being passed to a new generation, and Biden wants to be the guy picking up the torch.\n\nHe certainly pursues status.\n\nI mean, he certainly wants to be a person of consequence.\n\n>> In fact, he went to the library and started looking up Kennedy's background to figure out, how did this person become president?\n\nWhat does it take to get there?\n\n>> NARRATOR: Now, the son of a car salesman, the bullied kid with a stutter, decided to aim impossibly high-- pursue John F. Kennedy's path into politics.\n\nKennedy was a young senator.\n\nBiden set his sights on the Senate.\n\nJack had a picture-perfect wife.\n\nAnd Joe would find a picture-perfect wife, Neilia.\n\n>> When he first meets his wife, he tells her he wants to be a young senator, and then he wants to be president.\n\nHe had that ambition very early on, which does tie in with John F.

if I can't, I lose.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But his campaign quickly started to unravel on national television.\n\n>> It sure isn't easy running for president these days.\n\nThis was not a good day for Joe Biden was it?\n\n>> No, it really wasn't.\n\n>> He just got into the race today, and no sooner than he did, he talked his way into a national controversy.\n\n>> He spent much of the day discussing these comments he made to a newspaper reporter about Senator Barack Obama: >> I mean, you got the first sort of mainstream African-American... >> Yeah.\n\n>> Who is articulate and bright, and-- and clean and a nice-looking guy.\n\nI mean, it's... that's a storybook, man.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Some people listening to those descriptions of Obama-- \"articulate, clean\"-- heard racial overtones, or at the very least condescension.\n\n>> I think when people heard \"the clean and articulate\" line, there was a wave of eye-rolling, certainly among African Americans.\n\nIt was the kind of well-intentioned but benighted commentary that you expect from people who inhabit environments where there aren't very many Black people, and the United States Senate has historically been a prime example of that.\n\n>> Tonight, his campaign is doing damage control.\n\n>> There goes Joe Biden, running his mouth one more time.\n\nHow humiliating to be hoist on this, this dumb aside that he makes about Barack Obama.\n\n>> Joe Biden's apologizing for a remark he made about Senator Barack Obama... >> And of course that's going to be the thing that does him in-- it's totally, completely humiliating.\n\n>> The latest news is that Joe Biden is dropping out of the race.\n\nJoe Biden is dropping out... >> Nobody is paying attention to Joe Biden.\n\nIt is humiliating.\n\nFrom the brash young upstart candidate of 1987, now he's the picture of the establishment that nobody wants anymore.\n\n(train horn blares) (bell ringing) (birds chirping) >> It really did seem like that might be the end.\n\nHe had run for president twice, it hadn't worked.\n\nAnd then, the most unlikely thing happened, which is Barack Obama, the person who he had offended early on in this race, decided actually he needed Joe Biden in his candidacy.\n\n(phone ringing) >> President Obama believes that diversity is a strength, and that the country was absorbing a lot picking their first Black president.\n\nAnd so having someone who had years of experience in the Senate, someone who had vast experience in foreign affairs, I think he thought they made a good team.\n\n>> He accepts the vice presidency because Barack Obama genuinely seems to need Joe Biden, and there's a way in which it flatters Joe Biden's ego, to feel like he's needed.\n\nAnd Joe Biden always wants to feel essential, indispensable.\n\n>> Barack Obama is projected to be the next president... >> Senator Barack Obama of Illinois will be the next... (cheers and applause) >> NARRATOR: Two decades after he'd first run, Joe Biden was closer to the presidency than ever.\n\n>> Biden's life has been full of these kinds of almost miraculous turns.\n\nBiden gets to be part of an operation that was not just making history, but it was cool.\n\n(cheers and applause) I mean this was a group led by Obama and Michelle Obama, who felt like they were laying the path to a new form of politics, a more inclusive, pathbreaking politics.\n\n(cheers and applause) and Biden got to be a part of that.\n\nIn many ways, Obama provided a form of redemption for Joe Biden.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> There was a lot of skepticism about Joe Biden among Black voters.\n\nThey were remembering the Anita Hill hearings.\n\nHe had this image as a good old boy, someone from an earlier era, someone who grew up during segregation.\n\nThe fact that the first Black president had appointed him to be his vice president really did a lot for Joe Biden for his standing in the Black community.\n\n(cheers and applause) (train horn honking) >> NARRATOR: His political career may have rebounded, but being vice president wasn't the job he'd been chasing all those years.\n\n>> I mean, it is a second-class job by definition.\n\nIt doesn't hold a lot of authority, and you're there just in case.\n\n(siren wailing) To be in the White House as second fiddle was frustrating.\n\n>> He'd been Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, senior in about everything he's done.\n\nWell, that's very... that's very big, that's powerful.\n\nAnd to give that up for a number two spot that you really can't do anything significant without getting the president, your boss', okay and approval?\n\nSure, there had to be an adjustment there.\n\n>> You know, I look at Biden sometimes, and sometimes I think I see when the camera... he believes has turned away from him and is no longer still on him.\n\nYou get a sense of the sadness.\n\nHis face folds into some considerable anguish.\n\n>> NARRATOR: To make matters worse, the president made jokes at Biden's expense.\n\n(cheers and applause) >> All this change hasn't been easy, so I've cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the White House.\n\nHe's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic, and you just have to keep him on a tight leash-- every, every once in a while, he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble, but...\n\nUh, enough about Joe Biden.\n\n(laughter) (laughter and applause) >> There was this tendency that Barack Obama had to make Joe Biden the punchline of his jokes, which then gave permission to everybody else in the room to roll their eyes at Joe Biden.\n\nAnd so it was this death spiral for Joe Biden, where he just kept tumbling down the status order.\n\n>> Biden was already mid-60s, close to 70 when he was vice president.\n\nThere were some young staffers who would, you know, they look at him as the old, kind of crazy Uncle Joe.\n\n>> And it pains him, because it goes back to who he was as a child when he was made fun of.\n\nLike, it was frustrating to him to be thought of as... just Uncle Joe.\n\n>> And he brings the issue to Obama.\n\nAnd he sits down with him at lunch and says, \"Listen, you know... \"you can't be talking about me that way, \"because it will diminish me, and I will be less valuable to you.\"\n\nAnd Obama took that to heart.\n\n>> Joe stayed focused on who he was, what he was doing, and the relationship he had with the president.\n\nThat's probably what got him through all that.\n\n>> The relationship grew, I think it grew over time, it grew through adversity.\n\nJoe Biden had a very consequential vice presidency, I mean, he was given special projects that were extremely important in the moment.\n\n(siren wailing) >> Biden did the parts of the White House job that Obama didn't really want to have to do.\n\nObama never wanted to set foot in Congress again if he could avoid it.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, loved it.\n\nYou know, he kept his gym membership at the Senate gym because he liked to go back there and schmooze with people.\n\n>> In the Senate, Vice President Biden to this day enjoys relationships on both sides of the aisle.\n\nHe knew that he could call them and they would take his call and he could go and thrash issues out with them.\n\n(laughter) >> The real question isn't \"What thing did you do?\"\n\nif you're vice president.\n\nThe real question is, \"how much influence on the president \"and the national policy coming out of the executive branch did the vice president have?\"\n\nAnd I think Biden had as much influence as any modern vice president, maybe with the exception of Dick Cheney.\n\nI think he was a very influential vice president, and an extremely loyal vice president.\n\n(waves crashing) ♪ ♪ >> There's been an uncommon bond between my boys and I.\n\nIt is different than anything that I've ever

the North Vietnamese Army.\n\nThey're not remotely comparable in terms of capability.\n\nThere's gonna be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy of the United States.\n\n>> Black smoke seen rising from the U.S. embassy, the chaos directly contradicting any talk of an orderly evacuation process.\n\nTwenty years of American and NATO-led gains collapsing in

(sighs) ...it didn't go well.\n\nUm... ...he talked a bit more about his own son than we did my son, and that, that didn't sit well with me.\n\n>> We had family members at Dover when we were there to, uh, receive our children's bodies.\n\nThat was the worst day of all of our lives.\n\nAnd to sit there and have him talk to us about Beau was the biggest insult.\n\n>> And his response was, \"I thought I was helping them.\"\n\nThat's really where it genuinely came from.\n\nAnd for someone who's lost as much as he has, to ha... to have the reaction that it wasn't helping them, I think is especially, um, heart-wrenching.\n\n>> And as those families and friends grieved, the president of the United States stood there checking his watch.\n\nIt was a scene that those families will never be able to forget.\n\nAnd they haven't.\n\n>> Well, I stood there on the tarmac...
