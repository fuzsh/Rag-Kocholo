Edwards believed that religion should be rooted not only in reason but also in emotion. Although 19th-century editors tried to tone down his style, Edwards is recognized today as a masterful preacher. In fact, he is considered by many to be America’s greatest religious thinker. A Spiritual Calling Born in East Windsor, Connecticut, Edwards was a child prodigy and entered what is now Yale University at the age of 12. While a graduate student there, Edwards experienced a spiritual crisis that led to what he later described as “religious joy.” He came to believe that such an intense religious experience was an important step toward salvation. In 1722, after finishing his education, Edwards followed the path of his father and grandfather and became a Puritan minister. In 1726, Edwards began assisting his grandfather, who was the minister at the parish church in Northampton, Massachusetts. When his grandfather died three years later, Edwards became the church’s pastor. Religious Revivalist Edwards soon became an effective preacher. In 1734 and\n\n1735, he delivered a series of sermons that resulted in a great number of conversions. The converts believed they had felt God’s grace and were “born again” when they accepted Jesus Christ. Edwards’s sermons helped trigger the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through New England from 1734 to 1750. The movement grew out of a sense among some Puritan ministers that their congregations had grown too self- satisfied. Delivered at the height of the Great Awakening, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” is the most famous of Edwards’s nearly 1,200 sermons. Last Years Although Edwards inspired thousands, his church dismissed him in 1750 because he wanted to limit membership to those who had undergone conversion. A year later, Edwards went to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where he became a missionary in a Native American settlement. In 1757, he accepted an appointment as president of what is now Princeton University. By the time of Edwards’s death the following year, the extremism of the Great Awakening had been rejected. However, his vision of humanity suspended, like a spider, over the burning pit of hell still maintains its emotional impact.\n\nJonathan Edwards 1703–\n\nVIDEO TRAILER KEYWORD: HML11-122A\n\nEdwards followed his father and g became a Pur 1726, Edwar his grandfath minister at th Northampto When his gra years later, E church’s pasto Religious Rev soon bec preach\n\nGo to thinkcentral.

RC-11(A) Reflect on understanding to monitor comprehension.\n\nWhat keeps you\n\nin line?\n\nA sense of morality probably keeps you from cheating on a test. In other words, you know cheating is wrong. But there are other reasons for behaving morally. Some people are anxious to please. Others fear the consequences of breaking the rules. Jonathan Edwards uses fear to get his point across in the sermon you’re about to read. ROLE-PLAY With a partner, take turns role-playing a conversation with a child who has been stealing. Your mission is to persuade him or her to stop. Before you begin, consider how best to keep the child in line. For example, you might frighten or shame the child or appeal to his or her pride.\n\nliterary analysis: persuasion\n\nPuritan theologian Jonathan Edwards delivered powerfully persuasive sermons. As in all persuasive writing, an Edwards sermon is shaped by the author’s purpose, his audience, and his context —that is, his reason for preaching, his Puritan congregation, and the times in which the Puritans lived. One of Edwards’s most prominent rhetorical or persuasive techniques is the use of biblical allusions —references to figures, events, or places in the Bible that he assumed his congregation would recognize. As you read Edwards’s sermon, look for passages that reveal how purpose and audience affect the tone of his sermon.\n\nreading skill: analyze emotional appeals\n\nEmotional appeals are messages designed to persuade an audience by creating strong feelings. They often include sensory language to create vivid imagery and loaded words to create these types of feelings:\n\nfear, which taps into a fear of losing one’s safety or security\n\npity, which draws on a sympathy or compassion for others\n\nguilt, which relies on one’s sense of ethics or morality As you read, use a chart like the one below to record examples of language that appeals to the emotions.\n\nExamples Emotional Appeals Òarrows of death fly unseenÓ appeals to fear by creating anxiety, unease\n\nvocabulary in context\n\nJonathan Edwards uses the listed words to help convey his spiritual message.

God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though they may imagine him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them, their damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared, the fire is made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them, and the pit hath opened its mouth under them.... b Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The arrows of death fly unseen at noonday; the sharpest sight cannot discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is nothing to make it appear, that God had need to be at the expense of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence, to destroy any wicked man, at any moment.... So that, thus it is that natural men 2 are held in the hand of God, over the pit of hell; they have deserved the fiery pit, and are already sentenced to it; and God is dreadfully provoked, his anger is as great towards them as to those that are actually suffering the executions of the fierceness of his wrath in hell; and they have done nothing in the least to appease or abate that anger, neither is God in the least bound by any promise to hold them up one moment; the devil is waiting for them, hell is gaping for them, the flames gather and flash about them, and would fain 3 lay hold on them, and swallow them up; the fire pent up in their own hearts is struggling to break out: and they have no interest in any Mediator, 4 there are no means within reach that can be any security to them. In short, they have no refuge, nothing to take hold of.... c The bow of God’s wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new, and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of religion in your families and closets, 5 and in the house of God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction.... d The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked: his\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nwhet (hwDt) adj. sharpened\n\ndiscern (dG-sûrnP) v. to perceive or recognize something\n\nappease (E-pCzP) v. to bring peace, quiet, or calm to; to soothe\n\nc EMOTIONAL AppEALs Loaded language, or words with strong emotional associations, can be used to influence an audience’s attitude.

Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; 7 and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment.... It is everlasting wrath. It would be dreadful to suffer this fierceness and wrath of Almighty God one moment; but you must suffer it to all eternity.

You will know certainly that you must wear out long ages, millions of millions of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with this almighty merciless vengeance; and then when you have so done, when so many ages have actually been spent by you in this manner, you will know that all is but a point to what remains. So that your punishment will indeed be infinite. Oh, who can express what the state of a soul in such circumstances is! All that we can possibly say about it, gives but a very feeble, faint representation of it; it is inexpressible and inconceivable: For “who knows the power of God’s anger?” 9 How dreadful is the state of those that are daily and hourly in the danger of this great wrath and infinite misery! But this is the dismal case of every soul in this congregation that has not been born again, however moral and strict, sober and religious, they may otherwise be.... And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in the door calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming 10 from the east, west, north, and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you rest one moment in such a condition?... Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath\n\nto come.... f\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n“who knows... anger?”: an allusion to Psalm 90:11 in the Bible—“Who knoweth the power of thine anger?”\n\nMany... coming: a reference to the hundreds of people who were being converted during the Great Awakening.\n\ndeliverance (dG-lGvPEr-Ens) n. rescue from danger\n\nmitigation (mGt-G-gAPshEn) n. lessening of something that causes suffering\n\nf ALLUSION Reread lines 75 to the end, and consider how purpose and audience influence Edwards’s language in these lines. As habitual readers of the Bible, members of his congregation would be familiar with the biblical contrast between a God of wrath and a God of mercy. In lines 87–88, they would recognize a biblical allusion or reference in the quotation from Psalm 90. In line 99, they would hear echoes of biblical passages that identify Christ as the lamb of God and that associate Christ’s blood with the cleansing of sin. How do allusions such as these increase the persuasive appeal of Edwards’s sermon?
