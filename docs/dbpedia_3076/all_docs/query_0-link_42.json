        "text": "Kendall – Sara G. Merle (Pastor Sara) went gracefully home to her Lord and Savior on August 1, 2024, at the age of 71 after a lengthy illness. She went peacefully, surrounded by her family in the house she built with her husband. Born July 21, 1953, in Pittsburgh, PA, she was the daughter of the late Chalmers and Jesse Gilbert. She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Douglas C. Merle; her children, Nathan (Kristin) Merle, Kristen (Dwight) Hess, and Katie (Nolan) Flores; her grandchildren, Allison & Mason Merle, Rebekah, Raymond, & Ruth Hess, and Levi & Claire Flores; and her brother, Jim (Sandy) Gilbert.\n\nSara led a God-centered life starting as a Christian Education Director. While raising her three children, she felt called to go to Seminary. After graduating from The United Theological Seminary, she became ordained in the United Methodist Church. She had the opportunity to share the Word of God while shepherding the congregations at the United Methodist Churches in North Gainesville, Covington, Knowlesville, Millville, and retiring from Kendall. In retirement, she also spread the Word of God at Carlton and Holley UMC’s. While serving these churches, she was well known for leading the congregations in singing while enthusiastically playing the guitar. She never missed an opportunity to get people involved, which led many to a stronger spiritual awakening.\n\nSara lived a very active life and enjoyed many hobbies over the years including kayaking, fishing, camping, pottery, woodworking, and many different athletic activities. She competed in many events from marathons to Iron Girls, but her proudest achievement was kayaking the “90-miler” in the Adirondack Canoe Classic Race 13 years in a row (over 1,170 miles paddled). She was known to convince members of the church to join in her water adventures as the “Pit Crew” who could be seen outfitted in their “Paddling Pastors” team shirts. When not racing in her kayak, you could find Sara on the water with a fishing pole out at the many campsites in the Adirondacks. On many of their camping trips, Sara shared her passion for the outdoors with her friends, children, and grandchildren. Sara was also a talented potter and woodworker who often made creations for the altar, and gifts for her church members.\n\nSara’s family was the center of her world. She shared her competitive spirit by joining her children in their various athletic events from swimming, to biking, to running. She loved being “Grammy” to her seven grandchildren whom she enjoyed babysitting over the years. She had the great honor of baptizing each of them in their respective churches.\n\nSara was a true Fisher of Men. With our earthly sadness, there is great heavenly joy. She touched many lives while here on earth and will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nPlease join us in celebrating her life on Sunday, August 18th from 1-3 pm and 5-7 pm at the Hilton United Methodist Church, 21 West Ave, Hilton, NY 14468, where her Memorial Service will be held on Monday, August 19th at 11 am."
