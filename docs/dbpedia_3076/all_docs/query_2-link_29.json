        "text": "In addition to making his written works publicly accessible, the Jonathan Edwards Center provides tools for teachers and fosters connections among those who are interested in Edwards’s life and philosophy. The center offers an online course on Edwards through Yale Classes Online. It has created one- and two-day instructional modules for use in high school history and English classes as well as a casebook for teachers on “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” that grounds the sermon in its historical context and connects it to Edwards’s system of thought and piety.\n\nIn an effort to make Edwards’s writing accessible to the public more quickly, the center has developed the Sermon Editing Project, which trains volunteers to transcribe and edit his work under staff supervision. Since 2012, 160 volunteers from 12 countries have worked on the project. The center sponsors an online, peer-reviewed journal, regular conferences and colloquia, and two publishing imprints. In response to Edwards’s worldwide significance, it has established a network of affiliated centers in 10 countries."
