        "text": "British film distributor\n\nEntertainment Film Distributors Limited is a British distributor of independent films in the UK and Ireland for various production companies, founded by Michael L. Green and currently run by his son Nigel Green.\n\nMichael L. Green was a veteran producer/distributor involved in the film industry since the 1930s when he was a teenager. In 1972, he founded Variety, a prolific film distributor. In 1978, Green closed Variety and with his two sons (Nigel and Trevor) formed Entertainment Film Distributors (and later its video arm Entertainment in Video), which served as one of the leading forces in UK distribution. Michael L. Green died on 17 June 2003 at the age of 84[2] and Trevor Green died on 30 April 2020 at the age of 66.[3]\n\nTheir first big success was Teen Wolf (1985) starring Michael J. Fox. Entertainment also released films for Empire Pictures and New World Pictures.\n\nMost notably, between 1990 and 2010, Entertainment distributed films made by New Line Cinema along with films from other independent production companies. One of the most notable series of films distributed to date is The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Beginning in 2008, Entertainment Film Distributors became The Weinstein Company's main United Kingdom distributor up until 2017, when the Harvey Weinstein scandal began. In 2010, distribution rights for New Line Cinema films in the UK and Ireland were folded into New Line's parent company Warner Bros. Entertainment Film Distributors have released many BAFTA- and Oscar-winning films including The Departed, Million Dollar Baby, Gosford Park, Brokeback Mountain and The Artist.\n\nList of films distributed include:\n\nTBA:"
