so dark and foreboding.\n\nWhere are the signs of hope?\n\nWhat are you calling us to do?\n\nWars, uprisings, displacements, hunger, poverty, and disease continue to claim victims by the millions around the world each year.\n\nOur ears do not want to hear their stories and our eyes do not want to see their plight because the suffering and destruction is so massive and cruel.\n\nIn our hearts and minds there is a desire to help somehow, but the crisis seem so overwhelming that we shake our heads in dismay and we wonder what the point is for us even to attempt to be witnesses for healing and hope in this hellish morass.\n\nWe beg with the song writer to open our eyes that we may see glimpses of truth you have for us.\n\nHelp us to follow the path of Jesus, the Suffering Servant. Give us the courage to be willing to walk the path of depression and pain with the victims of injustice here at home as well as abroad.\n\nHelp us to seek ways to light candles of hope, however small, through our words, our deeds, and our prayers, to encourage our sisters and brothers to hold onto the faith in spite of the pain and suffering they are facing.\n\nAnd help those of us who are among the fortunate ones, who have enough bread to eat, good health, and who live in relative peace, to open our heart to learn from our sisters and brothers who are living lives of grace and forgiveness in the horrid circumstances which surround them. O God, help us to light one candle rather than to curse the darkness.\n\nWe pray this in the name of Jesus, who knows what being a light in this dark world is all about.\n\n- Larry Kehler, Mennonite Central Committee, Canada, 2009\n\nBack to Top\n\nBuddhist Prayer for Peace\n\nMay all beings everywhere plagued with sufferings of body and mind quickly be freed from their illnesses.\n\nMay those frightened cease to be afraid, and may those bound be free.\n\nMay the powerless find power, and may people think of befriending one another.\n\nMay those who find themselves in trackless, fearful wildernesses--the children, the aged, the unprotected--be guarded by beneficent celestials, and may they swiftly attain Buddhahood.\n\n- Author Unknown\n\nBack to Top\n\nBaha'i Prayer for Peace\n\nBe generous in prosperity, and thankful in adversity.\n\nBe fair in thy judgment, and guarded in thy speech.\n\nBe a lamp unto those who walk in darkness, and a home to the stranger.\n\nBe eyes to the blind, and a guiding light unto the feet of the erring.\n\nBe a breath of life to the body of humankind, a dew to the soil of the human heart, and a fruit upon the tree of humility.\n\n- Baha'u'llah\n\nBack to Top\n\nChristian Prayer for Peace\n\nBlessed are the Peacemakers, for they shall be known as the Children of God.\n\nBut I say to you that hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.\n\nTo those who strike you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from those who take away your cloak, do not withhold your coat as well.\n\nGive to everyone who begs from you, and of those who take away your goods, do not ask for them again.\n\nAnd as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\n\n- Author Unknown\n\nBack to Top\n\nHindu Prayers for Peace\n\nOh God, lead us from the unreal to the Real.\n\nOh God, lead us from darkness to light.\n\nOh God, lead us from death to immortality.

Know that violence is the root cause of all miseries in the world.\n\nViolence, in fact, is the knot of bondage.\n\n\"Do not injure any living being.\"\n\nThis is the eternal, perennial, and unalterable way of spiritual life.\n\nA weapon howsoever powerful it may be, can always be superseded by a superior one; but no weapon can, however, be superior to non-violence and love.\n\n- Author Unknown\n\nBack to Top\n\nJewish Prayer for Peace\n\nCome let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, that we may walk the paths of the Most High.\n\nAnd we shall beat our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into pruning hooks.\n\nNation shall not lift up sword against nation- neither shall they learn war any more.

Peoples shall stream to it, and many nations shall come and say: \"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that God may teach us God's ways and that we may walk in God's paths.\" For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. God shall judge between many peoples, and shall arbitrate between strong nations far away; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more; but they shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.

Do not repay anyone evil for evil; but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. If possible, on your part, live at peace with all.Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave for the wrath of God; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” Rather, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.”21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\n\n- Romans 12:9-21\n\nBack to Top\n\nGod of Peace\n\nFinally, sisters and brothers,\n\nwhatever is true, whatever is honorable,\n\nwhatever is just, whatever is pure,\n\nwhatever is lovely, whatever is gracious,\n\nif there is any excellence and if there is anything worth of praise,\n\nthink about these things.\n\nKeep on doing what you have learned and received and heard\n\nand seen.
