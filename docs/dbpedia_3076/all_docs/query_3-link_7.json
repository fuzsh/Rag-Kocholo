        "text": "Writing on the Run. Edwards would often compose sermons in his head while riding on horseback from town to town. Since he couldnâ€™t write while riding, he would associate a thought with an area of his clothing and pin a piece of paper there to remind him. At the end of a journey, his clothes would sometimes be covered in paper.\n\nDistinguished Descendants. The descendants of Jonathan Edwards and his wife, Sarah Pierpont Edwards, are notoriously distinguished. The couple is related to, among others, Vice President Aaron Burr, First Lady Edith Roosevelt, writers O. Henry and Robert Lowell, and several U.S. Senators, college presidents, governors, and judges."
