The international symbol for the currency is BRL.\n\nWhen it comes to terminology, one unit of BRL is called a real (written out as R$1) and the plural is reais. In both cases, the “r” is pronounced like the English letter “h,” so these words may sound like “hey-all” and “hey-eyes” to a non-Portuguese speaker.\n\nThis post has everything you need to know about converting USD to BRL, including where to secure the best exchange rates and how to avoid paying high fees on your conversion.\n\nMoney Transfer Partners\n\n1\n\nXe Money Transfer\n\nInternational Transfers\n\n98+ currencies available to transfer to 130+ countries\n\nFast and Easy\n\nInitiate transfers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nFees\n\nXe offers low to no fees on money transfers\n\n1\n\nXe Money Transfer\n\nLearn More\n\nVia Xe's Website\n\n2\n\nWise – Multi-Currency Account\n\nConvert and hold\n\n55 currencies\n\nMonthly fees\n\n$0\n\nPayment options\n\nDirect debit, wire transfer, debit card, credit card & Apple Pay\n\n2\n\nWise – Multi-Currency Account\n\nLearn More\n\nVia Wise website\n\nHow to Convert USD to BRL\n\nCalculating a conversion of dollars to reais is fairly simple. You can either make the conversion using a currency calculator or do it by hand.\n\n1. Use a Currency Calculator\n\nUsing a currency conversion calculator is often the easiest way to get an estimate when you’re converting currency. Since exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, using a calculator can ensure your math is correct.\n\nKeep in mind that exchanging currency often comes with added fees that a conversion calculator won’t be able to predict. For instance, credit card companies and ATM networks usually charge a 1% conversion fee on all foreign transactions. Individual merchants may also charge supplemental fees if you ask them to convert the price of an item to your home currency at checkout.\n\n2. Calculate it Manually\n\nThe other option is to do the calculation manually using a simple mathematical formula. However, in order to do this, you need to know the current exchange rate. At the time of writing, $1 USD is worth R$5.2 BRL.\n\nOnce you know that information, multiply the amount you have in USD by the current exchange rate. The resulting number will show you the amount of reais that you have to spend on your trip.\n\nManual Currency Conversion Example\n\nLet’s say you have $500 USD and would like to figure out how many reais you have for a trip to Brazil. Using the current exchange rate, the formula for your conversion would look like this:\n\n$500 USD x 5.2 = R$2,600 BRL\n\nHow to Buy BRL\n\nWhen you’re ready to buy BRL, it’s a good idea to plan ahead to ensure that you pay the fewest fees. Here are three ways to get the currency you need while minimizing the fees you’ll be charged:\n\nExchange at a bank or credit union before your trip: Heading to your bank before your trip is often the most cost-effective way to exchange currency. Since you have an existing relationship with them, your bank is likely to give you the best exchange rates and charge the lowest fees. For example, Bank of America doesn’t charge its account holders an exchange fee. However, it does charge a shipping fee of $7.50 USD on orders worth less than $1,000.\n\nVisit your bank or an in-network ATM for withdrawals where possible: Similarly, if you need to exchange more money while you’re on your trip, try to visit a branch of your bank or find an in-network ATM. For example, Citibank waives ATM fees for Citigold users if they make a withdrawal from an ATM with a CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Mastercard logo while abroad. Most banking apps have an “ATM locator” feature to help you find the closest option, and using an ATM affiliated with your bank can help you avoid excess fees.\n\nOrder currency online: If your bank doesn’t offer online shipping, you can also use a third party to get currency delivered to your door. However, be aware of inflated costs with some of these vendors. Currency Exchange International (CXI), for instance, advertises that it does not charge an exchange fee for home deliveries. However, you’ll pay up to $30 for overnight shipping on transactions under $1,000 USD.\n\nMoney Transfer Partners\n\n1\n\nXe Money Transfer\n\nInternational Transfers\n\n98+ currencies available to transfer to 130+ countries\n\nFast and Easy\n\nInitiate transfers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nFees\n\nXe offers low to no fees on money transfers\n\n1\n\nXe Money Transfer\n\nLearn More\n\nVia Xe's Website\n\n2\n\nWise – Multi-Currency Account\n\nConvert and hold\n\n55 currencies\n\nMonthly fees\n\n$0\n\nPayment options\n\nDirect debit, wire transfer, debit card, credit card & Apple Pay\n\n2\n\nWise – Multi-Currency Account\n\nLearn More\n\nVia Wise website\n\n3\n\nCurrencyFair\n\nMulti-currency accounts\n\nHold over 20 currencies\n\nInternational transfers\n\nSend and receive to over 150 countries\n\nFast and secure\n\nMoney transfers up to 8x cheaper than traditional banks\n\n3\n\nCurrencyFair\n\nLearn More\n\nVia CurrencyFair's Website\n\nWhat to Avoid When Exchanging Currency\n\nExchanging currency at the airport: Exchanging currency at the airport is unquestionably convenient. Airports are among the most secure places to exchange money in Brazil and may be one of the few places you can buy reais after hours, but in-airport exchanges often offer some of the worst rates while charging some of the highest fees.\n\nCurrency exchange kiosks: You may find kiosks that look like ATMs and allow you to exchange money while on the go. These kiosks are often located in tourist areas or shopping centers, but you’ll likely pay a premium to use one of these convenient locations.\n\nNext Up:\n\nBest Travel Credit Cards 2024\n\nBest Credit Cards 2024\n\nBest Travel Insurance\n\nInformation provided on Forbes Advisor is for educational purposes only.
