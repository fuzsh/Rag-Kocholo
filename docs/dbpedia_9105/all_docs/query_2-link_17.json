        "text": "In addition to their higher interest rates, Brazil and Mexico benefitted from being relatively safe markets to invest in during the uncertain global environment since the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis in Europe and attracted capital flows that moved out of Russia. According to data from Factset, USD 15.7 billion of capital moved into Brazil during the period from January 31st to March 8th, and Brazil’s weight in the FTSE Emerging All Cap Index increased to 6.8% on March 8th from 6.4% on March 4th (FTSE Russell deleted Russia from all its equity indices effective March 7th, given the sanctions on Russia). Both active and passive investment strategies were likely to have steered assets under management from Russia into Brazil, helping the currency pick up steam earlier in the year.\n\nThe Brazilian real could continue to show resilience, considering the double-digit interest rates and the cooling-down inflation within the country have made it one of the few with positive real interest rates, in sharp contrast with the negative real rates still seen in most developed and other emerging economies. Although a relatively high economic growth outlook in the longer term may also support the currency value, the uncertainty of the Presidential election in October could pose some short-term currency risks.\n\n© 2023 London Stock Exchange Group plc and its applicable group undertakings (the “LSE Group”).
