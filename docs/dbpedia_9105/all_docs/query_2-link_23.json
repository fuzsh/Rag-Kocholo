        "text": "The strong performance of the real is evident from the significant figures in the country’s current account. Between January and October, the trade flow was positive at $46.95 billion, the best result for this period since 2007, and with a dynamism that more than offset the outflow of $22.29 billion from the financial flow.\n\nIn this context, the real has been quite strong, even with the recent stress in the market of U.S. Treasury bonds. At the beginning of October, the foreign exchange rate rose to R$5.22 per dollar, but by the beginning of this week it was already trading below R$4.9, a sign of the real’s resilience that was highlighted by Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto when he participated in a Bradesco event last week.\n\n“In the external sector, we’ve seen an impressive performance from agriculture. Why is the real so strong? We have a very large flow with high interest rates. Today, if you want to be positioned against the real, you have to pay the interest rate differential and face a large inflow. The real has stood out as a relatively stable currency in emerging markets, and the volatility of the currency has gone down compared to its peers,” Mr. Campos Neto said.\n\nThe leading role in this movement is played by Brazilian exports, which are likely to continue at a strong level, said Itaú Unibanco economist Julia Passabom, for whom this greater volume of sales abroad shows that the good performance of the trade balance is not a one-off event. “It is much more structural than cyclical, and so the trade balance may continue to benefit, but the size of this flow should be moderated by imports, which tend to recover along with economic activity.”\n\nMs. Passabom’s expectation is that the real will continue to perform well in 2024. “Of course, there is caution due to the effects of El Niño, but quantitatively we expect a volume similar to this year, with an acceleration in oil exports and with the soybean harvest not much different from current levels,” said the economist.\n\nHowever, exporters still keep some resources abroad, which leaves open the “alligator mouth” created by the difference between the shipped and the contracted exchange rate of about $60 billion on a 12-month moving average. The smaller the difference, the greater the bias toward further appreciation of the real.\n\n“One of the possible reasons why exporters started leaving money abroad during the pandemic was because they were worried about transportation costs,” said Ms. Passabom. “This may have made exporters aware of new financial instruments and adapt to a new reality, opting to keep some capital abroad, not only to pay for freight, but also to have cash abroad and pay for other expenses.”\n\nThe chief economist of Parcitas Investimentos, Vitor Martello, highlights the trade flow, but emphasizes that the exchange rate could perform better if the outflow from the capital account wasn’t so great. Considering the figures for direct investment in the country, he notes that “in investments made on factories we see a very low number, comparable to what we saw before the pandemic and to what we saw in 2009.” He continued, “It’s terrible, even more so when you consider that it’s below the level we saw during the pandemic, when we didn’t know what was going to happen to the world.”\n\nMr. Martello points out that with the strong growth in direct investment between 2003 and 2011, Brazil committed itself to delivering results, but now creditors are not willing to renew investment. “For example, we are exporting oil at low marginal cost, but no creditors are coming forward to give more dollars in the form of new investments, either because global liquidity is tight, because we don’t have investment grade, or because they are mostly ‘old economy’ companies without the ‘sex appeal’ of ESG,” he notes.\n\nAs a result, the current scenario for large Brazilian companies that could bring investment capital into the country is one of paying off debt incurred in the past, Mr. Martello points out. “This is only happening because foreign investors are making an option for profit taking. They could lend more, but that’s not what we’re seeing,” he said. “We’re in the third year of something that could last four to six years. A potential trigger for a turnaround is the ESG agenda and nearshoring, but the data doesn’t suggest that turnaround has started yet.”\n\nArmor Capital recently revised the forecast for the exchange rate at the end of the year to R$5 per dollar from R$4.9. “There is usually a worse flow throughout December, with outflows in the financial account. The trade account should help more than in other years, but it’s unlikely to neutralize this strong outflow in December. Despite this, we maintain a constructive outlook for the currency going forward,” said Andrea Damico, the firm’s chief economist.\n\nMs. Damico argues that after the negative seasonality of the end of the year, it is possible that drivers of exchange rate appreciation will prevail ahead. “The risk premium issue could still help in this regard, with the approval of the tax reform, the [sales tax] ICMS bill, the possible maintenance of the zero-deficit target for 2024 this year. We see this as an improvement in risk factors that could help the real.”\n\nKinea Investimentos, on the other hand, does not see any major asymmetries at the moment in relation to the domestic exchange rate, said economist Daniela Lima. “Even though the exporter leaves part of the resources abroad, we see a reasonable inflow of funds. However, the dynamics of the exchange rate are more than just a reflection of this effective exchange rate,” said Ms. Lima, recalling the significant volume of the derivatives market.\n\nData from B3 shows that foreign investors’ long positions in dollars (bets on the currency’s appreciation) through derivatives totaled $57.05 billion on Monday, while local institutional investors were short $10.47 billion in dollars. After a year that favored currencies with high interest rate differentials, Kinea has no positions in the real. “The exchange rate depends not only on the trade balance, but also on how the Central Bank will continue to ease monetary policy and, above all, what the Fed will do in the future,” said Ms. Lima."
