If you pay for a service in cash, we use these monthly consular exchange rates to convert the fee into local currency.\n\nConsular fees are charged in GPB under the Consular Fees Order 2012, as amended. Consular rates of exchange are set centrally in the UK and reviewed each month in line with changes to exchange rates.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nConsular fees are set in Pounds Sterling (GBP). They are payable in the currency circulating at the place of payment. Consular officers have discretion to accept, in lieu of such currency, a cheque, money order, or other means to pay in terms of that currency."
