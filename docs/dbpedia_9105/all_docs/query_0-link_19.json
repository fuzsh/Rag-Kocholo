        "text": "The current flag of Brazil was officially adopted on November 19, 1889. The flag design was inspired by the banner of the former Empire of Brazil (1822-1889).\n\nThe National flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond (rhombus), and in its center floats a blue celestial globe with 27 white five-pointed stars. The globe displays a white equatorial band with the National Motto: ORDEM E PROGRESSO (\"Order and Progress\") in green letters. The green color of the flag represents the flora and fauna especially the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal, as well as the jungle situated along the Atlantic Ocean. The yellow diamond (rhombus) symbolizes the wealth of the nation's soil including the rich gold reserves. The blue circle and stars, depict the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the morning of 15 November 1889 - the day the Republic of Brazil was declared. The stars on the nation’s flag are contained in the Southern Cross, which is a symbolic constellation belonging to the southern hemisphere and also a few constellations around it. The only star above the white band is Spica which represents part of the nation’s territory situated in the northern hemisphere contained in the State of Pará. The 27 white five-pointed stars symbolize the Federal District’s stability in the nation’s union. The flag has a height-width proportion ratio of 10:7.\n\nHistory of the Flag of Brazil\n\nThe first Brazil flag was created during the Empire of Brazil. On September 7, 1822, a few days after the country’s independence from Portugal, the first Brazilian flag was presented to the country. From 1822-1889, the flag consisted of a green background, with a yellow diamond in the middle. When Brazil became a republic in 1889, the flag was modified, adding a blue circle on a starry sky with a curved band over it containing the national motto. The green background as well as the yellow diamond (rhombus) were both adopted from the former imperial flag. The green was the color of the House of Braganza of Pedro I, who served as Brazil's first Emperor. Gold was the color of the House of Habsburg which was the house of his wife named Empress Maria Leopoldina.\n\nThe official currency of Brazil is The Brazilian Real (R$). It is made up of subunits known as centavos where 1 Brazilian Real is made up of 100 centavos. The Brazilian Real is printed locally by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil and is issued by the Central Bank of Brazil. The Brazilian Real was introduced into circulation in 1994 to stabilize the economy which had experienced high inflation and replaced the cruzeiro real which was subsequently demonetized.\n\nCoins and Banknotes\n\nDuring the introduction of the New Brazilian Real in 1994, the Central Bank of Brazil issued stainless steel coins in 50, 25, 10, 5, one centavo, and one real denomination. However, the one real and one centavo coins were soon withdrawn from circulation by the Central Bank. The current banknotes in the circulation of the Brazilian Real are issued in 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, and two real denominations. The Central Bank has also issued commemorative coins and banknotes in line with the celebration of historical events. New polymer banknotes were issued by the Central Bank of Brazil in 2004.\n\nHistorical Currencies of Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian real (Old)\n\nThe old Brazilian Real (Rs$) was the first official currency to be used in Brazil and was introduced by the Portuguese during the country’s colonial period, replacing the Portuguese real. One Brazilian Real was comprised of 1000 subunits known as Reis. It was still used after Brazil gained independence in 1822. The old Brazilian Real was replaced by the Brazilian cruzeiro in 1942.\n\nThe Brazilian cruzeiro\n\nThe Brazilian cruzeiro was the official currency used in the country in the 20th century. The cruzeiro was named after the Southern Cross constellation whose Brazilian name is “Cruzeiro do Sul.” The currency was issued three times in the country’s history with the first issue being in 1942, replacing the colonial Brazilian Real. The cruzeiro was reissued in 1967 due to increased inflation and was in circulation until 1986. The Brazilian cruzeiro (Cr$) was issued a third time in 1990. The third cruzeiro was replaced in 1993 by the cruzeiro real.\n\nThe Brazilian cruzeiro real\n\nThe Brazilian cruzeiro real was introduced by the Central Bank of Brazil on August 1st, 1993, as a replacement for the Brazilian cruzeiro. The Brazilian cruzeiro real was made up of 100 units known as centavos which only existed for accounting. However, the currency’s circulation in the economy was short-lived with the cruzeiro real being replaced by the current Brazilian Real on June 30th, 1994 with one Brazilian real being equivalent to 2750 cruzeiros reals."
