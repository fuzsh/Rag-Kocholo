        "text": "Estimated read time: 8 minutes, 42 seconds\n\nIt has never been easier to sell products to customers all over the world. And if you sell only digital products in your online store, there are even fewer limitations.\n\nBut selling to international customers involves a lot more than converting dollar amounts and slapping a different currency symbol in front of it. There are four main elements you need to be aware of when formatting prices on your website.\n\nAnd yes, you need to alter all four elements to correctly localize your pricing. If you localize halfway, customers will wonder what else you’re doing only halfway. So, if you’re going to display different currencies based on your customer’s geographic location, do it right.\n\nNote, the formatting may vary depending on the language and region settings of international shoppers’ browsers.\n\nHere is the list of four formatting elements to consider when creating localized prices and a comprehensive list of countries and their currency formats.\n\n1. Symbol Placement\n\nIn the US, we’re used to the dollar symbol being to the left of the dollar amount. But currency symbol placement changes based on geographic location. For example, countries in the European Union place the euro symbol to the right of the dollar amount.\n\nBut to make things interesting, Canada does it both ways. In English Canada, the dollar symbol goes to the left of the amount, while in French Canada, the dollar sign goes to the right.\n\nAs a US business, you may be tempted to keep all currency symbols to the left of the dollar amount to keep things consistent. But don’t do it. While it may make sense for you, changing the placement of the currency symbol will be confusing for your foreign customers.\n\n2. Spacing\n\nWhen you look at price tags, you probably don’t think about spacing very much. Do you even know if the US adds a space between the dollar symbol and the amount? I don’t think I ever really paid attention. The answer is, no, there is no space between the dollar symbol and the amount for US currency.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a non-breaking space between the dollar amount and the euro sign for EU countries. But don’t assume spacing is determined by the placement of the currency symbol. There are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to spacing; you just have to check the pricing format for individual countries and locations.\n\n3. Commas vs. Decimal Points\n\nIn the US, dollars and cents are separated by a decimal point and thousands are separated by a comma. But in many countries the opposite is true—they use commas for fractional separators and decimals for thousand separators.\n\nTo determine how countries use commas and decimals in their pricing format, you have to check on each location. But again, Canada likes to mix it up. They us a decimal as the fractional separator in the English-speaking parts of the country, and a comma as the fractional separator in the French-speaking parts of the country.\n\n4. Abbreviations vs. Symbols\n\nEach country has a three-letter code for their currency. These codes are usually meant for the international banking business and data interchange between computers. Which means most people aren’t familiar with the three-letter codes. However, you can use these banking codes as a last resort if your website’s font can’t handle specific currency symbols.\n\nIf you need to decide between the currency’s abbreviation/code or symbol, choose only one. While using both the abbreviation and symbol seems to make sense, it looks weird. Once you decide between the symbol or code, be consistent across all currencies.\n\nNow that you know what to look for in currency formats, let’s look at how some of the most popular countries format their pricing.\n\nPopular Country Currencies\n\nArgentina\n\nCurrency: Argentine Peso\n\nAbbreviation/Code: ARS\n\nSymbol: $\n\nFormat: Symbol to the left of the amount, non-breaking space, comma is
