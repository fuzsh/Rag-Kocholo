        "text": "What is the currency in Brazil?\n\nThe official currency in Brazil is the Brazilian Real, which is issued and overseen by the Central Bank of Brazil. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - BRL. In stores and restaurants, Brazilian Real prices are likely to use the currency symbol R$.\n\nOnce you’re in Brazil you’ll see costs of items shown in BRL and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 BRL and coins - 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos; 1 BRL.\n\nCan you officially pay in CAD when you are in Brazil?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in CAD in Brazil, which is why it’s time to start getting used to BRL and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including Canadian dollar/Brazilian Real rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nBrazilian RealCurrency nameBrazilian RealISO codeBRLSymbolR$SubunitCentavoCentral BankCentral Bank of BrazilBest travel cards to take to BrazilWise\n\nBRL coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the BRL coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in Brazil.\n\nBRL banknotesBRL coinsbanknotes - 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 BRLcoins - 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos; 1 BRL\n\nHistory of Brazilian Real currency\n\nThe Brazilian Real (BRL) was introduced in 1994 to stabilize the Brazilian economy from hyperinflation. It replaced the cruzeiro real as part of the Plano Real, a substantial monetary reform package that successfully curbed inflation and fostered economic growth.\n\nIs CAD accepted in Brazil?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in Brazil is BRL. If you carry CAD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your CAD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in BRL when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like Wise, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in BRL should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to Brazil\n\nUsing a travel debit card in Brazil is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in the UK offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in BRL. That allows you to add a balance in CAD and switch over to BRL to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have BRL in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in Brazil.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for £ 1 CAD/BRL?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live CAD/BRL rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the CAD/BRL rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the CAD/BRL mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily.\n\nShould I exchange CAD to BRL before traveling to Brazil?\n\nIt’s a good idea to exchange CAD to BRL before you head off to Brazil, as you can often find a better exchange rate and lower overall costs before you travel.\n\nWhen you’re in Brazil you’re going to need BRL in cash for some of your spending - particularly when tipping or making smaller value purchases. Buying your BRL travel money in advance can get you better CAD/BRL exchange rates, and saves you wasting precious time shopping around for a good deal once you arrive in Brazil.\n\nTips for exchanging money in Brazil\n\nAt merchants and ATMs, make sure you’re charged in BRL. If you’re asked if you’d rather pay in CAD instead, say no. That’s a sign of dynamic currency conversion, which usually means extra costs. ATMs are widely used in Brazil so withdrawing money in target-currency is easy, particularly in big cities and Brasília.\n\nBest place to exchange currency in Brazil\n\nYou can get your BRL in Brazil in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like [wise-affiliate-name-links] to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in CAD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in Brazil?\n\nYou’ll need to have BRL to spend in Brazil. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in Brazil.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in BRL.\n\n2. BRL cash\n\nCash is widely used in Brazil, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to BRL before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in Brazil.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in Brazil, but carrying some cash in BRL is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in BRL when you’re in Brazil. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in CAD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in Brazil with a CAD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in Brazil using the [wise-affiliate-name-links] card you can either choose to convert your account balance to BRL in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in CAD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in Brazil\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in CAD when you visit Brazil - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like [wise-affiliate-name-links], or stock up on BRL in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal. Use this guide to learn all you need to know about the options, rates and fees for exchanging CAD to BRL, and make your money go further while you’re away.\n\nThe official currency in Brazil is BRL. You can’t usually pay in CAD in Brazil, so you’ll need to plan in advance to get your travel money sorted. Consider ordering a travel debit card from a service like Wise, for low cost conversions to BRL and convenient spending and withdrawals - and remember that knowing the CAD to BRL mid-market exchange rate is essential to check you’re getting a fair deal on currency exchange.\n\nFAQ - Currency in Brazil\n\nWhat is the currency in Brazil called?\n\nThe official currency in Brazil is the Brazilian Real.
