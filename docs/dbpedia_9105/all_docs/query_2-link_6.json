        "text": "Exchange Rate in Brazil\n\nFrom 2013 to 2022, the Brazilian real faced significant depreciation, largely due to political turmoil, economic instability, and low commodity prices early in the period. Government efforts to stabilize the economy had mixed results, and by 2022, the real remained weak against major currencies, reflecting ongoing economic and political challenges in Brazil. That said, the currency did manage to claw back some ground in 2022 on high interest rates and a jump in commodity prices.\n\nThe exchange rate ended 2022 at BRL 5.28 per USD, compared to the end-2021 value of BRL 5.57 per USD and the figure a decade earlier of BRL 2.36 per USD.

FocusEconomics collects Brazilian exchange rate projections for the next ten years from a panel of 35 analysts at the leading national, regional and global forecast institutions. These projections are then validated by our in-house team of economists and data analysts and averaged to provide one Consensus Forecast you can rely on for each indicator. By averaging all forecasts, upside and downside forecasting errors tend to cancel each other out, leading to the most reliable exchange rate forecast available for Brazilian exchange rate.\n\nDownload one of our sample reports to visualize what a Consensus Forecast is and see our Brazilian exchange rate projections.\n\nWant to get access to the full dataset of Brazilian exchange rate forecasts?
