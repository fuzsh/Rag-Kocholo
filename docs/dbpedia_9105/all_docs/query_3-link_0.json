For the currency of Brazil from the colonial period to 1942, see Brazilian real (old).\n\n\"BRL\" redirects here.

It is subdivided into 100 centavos. The Central Bank of Brazil is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994.\n\nAs of April 2019, the real was the twentieth most traded currency.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrencies in use before the current real include:\n\nThe Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis.\n\nThe old Brazilian real from 1747 to 1942, with 1,000 réis also called the milréis.\n\nThe first cruzeiro from 1942 to 1967, at 1 cruzeiro = 1 milréis or 1,000 réis.\n\nThe cruzeiro novo from 1967 to 1970, at 1 cruzeiro novo = 1,000 first cruzeiros. From 1970 it was simply called the (second) cruzeiro and was used until 1986.\n\nThe cruzado from 1986 to 1989, at 1 cruzado = 1,000 second cruzeiros.\n\nThe cruzado novo from 1989 to 1990, at 1 cruzado novo = 1,000 cruzados. From 1990, because of the Plano Collor it was renamed the (third) cruzeiro and was used until 1993.\n\nThe cruzeiro real (CR$) from 1993 to 1994, at 1 cruzeiro real = 1,000 third cruzeiros.\n\nThe current real was introduced in 1994 at 1 real = 2,750 cruzeiros reais.\n\nThe modern real (Portuguese plural reais or English plural reals) was introduced on 1 July 1994, during the presidency of Itamar Franco, when Rubens Ricupero was the Minister of Finance as part of a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, known as the Plano Real. The new currency replaced the short-lived cruzeiro real (CR$). The reform included the demonetisation of the cruzeiro real and required a massive banknote replacement.\n\nAt its introduction, the real was defined to be equal to 1 unidade real de valor (URV, \"real value unit\") a non-circulating currency unit. At the same time, the URV was defined to be worth 2,750 cruzeiros reais, which was the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the cruzeiro real on that day. As a consequence, the real was worth exactly one U.S. dollar as it was introduced; that was equivalent to R$10 in 2020. Combined with all previous currency changes in the country's history, this reform made the new real equal to 2.75 × 1018 (2.75 quintillion) of Brazil's original réis.\n\nSoon after its introduction, the real unexpectedly gained value against the U.S. dollar, due to large capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995. During that period it attained its maximum dollar value ever, about US$1.20=R$1. Between 1996 and 1998 the exchange rate was tightly controlled by the Central Bank of Brazil, so that the real depreciated slowly and smoothly to the dollar, dropping from near US$1=R$1 to about US$1=R$1.2 by the end of 1998. In January 1999 the deterioration of the international markets, disrupted by the Russian default, forced the Central Bank, under its new president Arminio Fraga, to float the exchange rate. This decision produced a major devaluation, to a rate of almost US$1=R$2.[2]\n\nIn the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downward path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation. Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies.\n\nThe crisis subsided once Lula took office, after he, his finance minister Antonio Palocci, and Arminio Fraga reaffirmed their intention to continue the orthodox macroeconomic policies of his predecessor (including inflation-targeting, primary fiscal surplus and floating exchange rate, as well as continued payments of the public debt). The value of the real in dollars continued to fluctuate but generally upwards, so that by 2005 the exchange was a little over US$1=R$2. In May 2007, for the first time since 2001 (six years), the real became worth more than US$0.50 — even though the Central Bank, concerned about its effect on the Brazilian economy, had tried to keep it below that symbolic threshold. Lula started his government in 01/01/2003 with an exchange rate of US$1=R$3.52 and finished it in 12/31/2010 with an exchange rate of US$1=R$1.66.[3]\n\nThe exchange rate as of September 2015 was US$1=R$4.05. After a period of gradual recovery, it reached US$1=R$3 by February 2017.\n\nJair Bolsonaro's tenure, initially welcomed with enthusiasm by the financial markets, started with US$1=R$3.86. Fueled by meager results of the economy, quick disenchantment followed, resulting in a lack of foreign investments and a real's strong depreciation.[4] On 13 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which deeply affected Brazil,[5] the real reached a historical low against the US dollar, being negotiated at US$1=R$5.90.[6]\n\nFollowing Lula's reelection in the 2022 general elections, the market, which was expected to have reacted poorly, turned out favorable in the first week.[7][8] The US dollar exchange hit its lowest point since 29 August 2022, dropping from roughly US$1=R$5.30 immediately before the second round of the election, to about US$1=R$5.05 a week after Lula's win.\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst series (1994–1997)\n\n[edit]\n\nAlong with the first series of currency, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1 real on 30 June 1994; the 25 centavos piece was soon followed on 30 September 1994 due to the constant lack of change in intermediate values in the centavos range, which caused the validity of the old Cruzeiro and Cruzeiro Real banknotes to be extended for two months beyond what was initially intended for the exchange of banknotes and coins until then in circulation for new ones in the pattern that began to circulate in the second half of 1994. All were struck in stainless steel.\n\nThe coins issued in 1994 are identical in size and weight to the older cruzeiro real coins, save for the 1-centavo piece which corresponded to the even older 1000-cruzeiro coin, as no CR$1 coin was made. This influenced the replacement of this family with a newer one in 1998.\n\nThe original 1-real coins, produced only in 1994, were demonetized on 23 December 2003,[9] due to frequent counterfeiting.[10] All other coins remain legal tender.\n\nFirst series Image Value Design Emission start date Withdrawn 1 centavo Obverse: Large denomination flanked by linear patterns.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 1 July 1994 Current 5 centavos Obverse: Large denomination flanked by linear patterns.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 10 centavos Obverse: Large denomination flanked by linear patterns.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 50 centavos Obverse: Large denomination flanked by linear patterns.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 1 real Obverse: Large denomination flanked by linear patterns.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 23 December 2003 25 centavos Obverse: Large denomination intersected by wavy lines.\n\nReverse: Head of Republic. 30 September 1994 Current\n\nCommemorative coins\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Central Bank of Brazil released two commemorative variants of the 10 and 25 centavos coins.\n\nCirculating commemorative coins of the Brazilian real's first series Image Value Details 10 centavos Release date: 31 May 1995\n\nOccasion: The 50th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\n\nUnits produced: 1 million for each design\n\nReverse: The 10 centavos coin depicts hands offering a plant shoot with folious ramifications, and the 25 centavos coin depicts crop cultivation.

It featured copper-plated steel coins of 1 and 5 centavos, bronze-plated steel 10 and 25 centavos, cupronickel 50 centavos coin, and a bimetallic nickel-brass and cupronickel coin of 1 real. In 2002 cupronickel was replaced with stainless steel for the 50-centavo coin and the central part of the 1-real coin, and the nickel-brass ring was changed to a bronze-plated steel one.[10][15]\n\nIn November 2005, the Central Bank discontinued the production of the 1 centavo coins, but the existing ones continue to be legal tender. Retailers now generally round their prices to the next 5 or 10 centavos.[citation needed]\n\nSecond series Image Value Design 1 centavo\n\n(no longer produced) Obverse: The Southern Cross in right upper side.\n\nReverse: Depicts Pedro Álvares Cabral, Portuguese sea captain and Brazil's colonizer, with a 16th-century Portuguese ship in the background. 5 centavos Obverse: The Southern Cross in right upper side.\n\nReverse: Depicts Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (also known as Tiradentes), martyr of an early independence movement known as the Minas Conspiracy.

a collector named Pedro Pinto Balsemão claimed to have found a trial strike of the R$1, with a never before seen design, completely different from circulating 1 real coins.[21] Despite the initial skepticism, it was later supposedly confirmed via FOIA [pt] requests and interviews that Casa da Moeda do Brasil had minted trial strikes of the R$1 coin prior to the currency design change in 1998, with custom designs that were purposefully different to the final product as to avoid leaks.[22][23]\n\nIn May 2021, however, Bentes Group published an explanation as to why the \"Real Bromélia\" was not included in their Brazilian coins catalog. They claim to have done extensive research into the piece, and to have concluded that it is not a trial strike or test coin, but instead a sort of vending machine token with no numismatic value.[24]\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst series (1994–2010)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, banknotes print \"A\" were issued by Casa da Moeda do Brasil in the amounts of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 reais, in addition to supplementary issues of banknotes ordered abroad in the values of 5, 10 and 50 reais of the print \"B\" produced abroad by the companies Giesecke+Devrient, Thomas de la Rue and François-Charles Oberthur Fiduciaire respectively. In 1997, modified banknotes of 1 real (print \"B\"), 5 and 10 reais (print \"C\") were launched, bearing the national flag as a watermark instead of the effigy of the republic in order to reduce the risk of such banknotes being used for counterfeiting banknotes at higher denominations. In 2000, the 10 reais commemorative banknote (print \"D\") was launched, and this banknote was the first polymer banknote to be issued in the country. In 2000 and 2001, the 2 and 20 reais banknotes were launched, respectively, using the sea turtle and the golden lion tamarin in the watermark and theme, and the 20 reais banknote was the first to make use of holographic elements on the Brazilian banknotes. In 2003, the print \"C\" of the 1 real banknote was put into circulation, which would have the name \"República Federativa do Brasil\" at the top in the place where the name \"Banco Central do Brasil\" was customarily placed, which was placed on the under the obverse of the bill, next to the word real. Such banknote ceased to be issued in 2005.\n\nFirst series[25] Image Value Dimensions Description Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse 1 real 140 mm × 65 mm The Republic's Effigy,\n\nportrayed as a bust Sapphire-spangled emerald hummingbird (Amazilia lactea) 2 reais Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) 5 reais Great egret (Casmerodius albus) 10 reais Green-winged macaw (Ara chlorepterus) 20 reais Golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) 50 reais Jaguar (Onça pintada, Panthera onca) 100 reais Dusky Grouper (Epinephelus marginatus)\n\nCommemorative banknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2000, in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival on Brazilian shores, the Brazilian Central Bank released a polymer 10 real banknote that circulated along with the other banknotes above. The Brazilian Mint printed 250 million of these notes, which at the time accounted for about half of the 10 real banknotes in circulation.\n\nObverse Reverse Value Year Material Description 10 reais 2000 Polymer Obverse: Image of Pedro Álvares Cabral, the colonizer of Brazil.\n\nReverse: Stylized version of the map of Brazil, with pictures highlighting the ethnic and cultural plurality of the country.\n\nSecond series (2010–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 3 February 2010, the Central Bank of Brazil announced the new series of the real banknotes which would begin to be released in April 2010. The new design added security enhancements in an attempt to reduce counterfeiting. The notes have different sizes according to their values to help vision-impaired people. The changes were made reflecting the growth of the Brazilian economy and the need for a stronger and safer currency. The new banknotes began to enter circulation in December 2010, coexisting with the older ones.[26][27] On 29 July 2020, the Central Bank of Brazil announced the release of the 200 reais banknote.[28] It was released into circulation on 2 September 2020.[29]\n\nSecond series Image Value Dimensions Main color Description Date of first issue Watermark Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse 2 reais 121 mm × 65 mm Blue Wave pattern; head of Republic Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) 29 July 2013 Hawksbill turtle and electrotype 2 5 reais 128 mm x 65 mm Purple Plants; head of Republic Great egret (Casmerodius albus) 29 July 2013 Great egret and electrotype 5 10 reais 135 mm × 65 mm Red Plants; head of Republic Green-winged macaw (Ara chlorepterus) 23 July 2012 Green-winged macaw and electrotype 10 20 reais 142 mm × 65 mm Yellow Plants; head of Republic Golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) 23 July 2012 Golden lion tamarin and electrotype 20 50 reais 149 mm × 70 mm Brown Jungle plants; head of Republic Jaguar (Panthera onca) 13 December 2010 Jaguar and electrotype 50 100 reais 156 mm × 70 mm Cyan Underwater plants and starfish; head of Republic; coral Dusky Grouper (Epinephelus marginatus); coral 13 December 2010 Dusky Grouper and electrotype 100 200 reais 142 mm × 65 mm Grey Savanna plants; head of Republic Maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) 2 September 2020 Maned wolf and electrotype 200\n\nAmong the security features of the second series is ultraviolet printing in the design, referred to as \"fluorescent elements\".[30] These appear and glow under ultraviolet light.\n\nExchange rates\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent exchange rates\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent BRL exchange rates From Google Finance: AUD CAD CHF CNY EUR GBP HKD JPY USD ARS JPY USD From Yahoo!
