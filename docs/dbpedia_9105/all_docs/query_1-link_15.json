Don't forget to check out our guide for your stay in London, too.\n\nTransportation\n\nIn our how much currency to bring abroad chart below, you'll see a 10 mile cab ride is on average about $12.32 in Rio de Janeiro. Having this information on hand will give you a good idea on how much you would need to get around the city.\n\nFood\n\nWhen you think Brazilian food, perhaps you think of steak. I know I do! But have you heard of coxinha, brigadeiros, feijoada, or even acarajé?\n\nThese are all must tries as coxinha consists of shredded chicken, covered in dough, which is then battered, fried, and oftentimes accompanied by potato and cheese that makes one of the most delicious meals you can have authentically in Brazil.\n\nFor dessert, definitely help yourself to the Rio de Janeiro born brigadeiro-Brazil's novelty dessert that's essentially the equivalent to an American bon bon. Delicious!\n\nTo find all of these dishes, we recommend you check out Estrelas Da Babilonia, a restaurant known for its food and fantastic view of Copacabana.\n\nAs shown in our how much currency to bring abroad chart above, it costs on average $57.44 for a budget dinner for two and $2.16 for a pint of beer.\n\nCurrency: Brazilian Real\n\nThe Brazilian real has six different denominations: R$2, R$5, R$10, R$20, R$50 and R$100. When you look at the Brazilian real, be sure to check out each notes beautiful design which features a prominient, Brazilian female figure on one side and a bird or animal that's native to the land on the reverse. Each denomination also has its own color scheme in variations of reds, blues, purples, and oranges.\n\nIf you have leftover Brazilian reals after your trip to Rio, CXI will buy them back from you.

This is Brazil's winter time as the country lies in the southern hemisphere; perfect if you want to escape the heat in the United States.\n\nThe weather in Brazil this time of year also happens to be incredibly comfortable, with highs sitting in the mid to high 60's (Fahrenheit). Prices on a majority of tourist accommodations also tend to be cheaper this time of year, and much more obtainable as Brazil doesn't see a high turn out for tourists May through October.\n\nVacation rentals\n\nIf you find yourself looking into hotels to stay in during your trip to Brazil, we dare you to venture outside the box.\n\nWhen traveling abroad, why not get the most out of your escape and live like a local for a few days?
