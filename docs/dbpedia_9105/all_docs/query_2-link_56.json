        "text": "What to do about Money in South America\n\nEvery country in South America has a different currency (or even currencies!) and so you can't pursue a one-size fits all policy, although you'll find that US dollars are widely exchanged even where they aren't legal tender.\n\nUsing Cash Machines in South America\n\nCash machines are pretty widespread throughout South America, and many dispense both US dollars and the local currency. However, in rural areas things can be more difficult in that respect, and in a few countries you can run into trouble with some banks not being properly connected to international networks. However, these days you're unlikely to be far from a cash machine at any point unless you're going seriously off the beaten track.\n\nUsing Credit Cards in South America\n\nIn contrast to the ubiquity of cash machines in South America, there are big differences between countries in the use of credit cards. In Brazil or Argentina, people use credit cards regularly, and that's true to some extent in Chile, Peru and Ecuador. However, outside of the capitals in Bolivia or Paraguay, for example, it's vanishingly rare for people to people to flash the plastic.\n\nWe'd advise you to check the individual currency guides for each country for detailed advice on budgets, costs and what to do about cash in each country in South America.\n\nThe exchange rates below were correct as of 17:25 on 19 August 2024."
