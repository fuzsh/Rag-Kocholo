        "text": "Tourists who came to Brazil for last year's World Cup are probably lamenting the fact that the tournament wasn't held in 2015 instead. Since the beginning of the year, Brazil's real has been one of the fastest-falling currencies among major economies.\n\nA tourist arriving in Rio de Janeiro with $6,600 (Â£4,300) in January would have been able to book a suite for a week in the city's luxurious Copacabana Palace. Now the same amount of US dollars can stretch to ten nights.\n\nBrazil is not alone in its currency woes.\n\nThe devaluation is a worldwide trend among many currencies due to different factors; from China's slowdown, the fall in commodity prices and the US's imminent decision to raise its interest rates. When that happens, some investors are likely to leave riskier emerging countries for safer gains in the US.\n\nBut Brazil also has severe domestic problems that are taking its toll on the currency.\n\nThe year started with a big challenge for Brazil's newly re-elected President Dilma Rousseff, as everyone expected the economy to contract.\n\nBut the second half of the year has seen Brazil's crisis turn sharply to worse.\n\nIn July, Mr Levy acknowledged that despite his best efforts, the government would not be able to meet this year's spending target - needed to lower the country's debt burden.\n\nUnder pressure, the government took one of its most controversial decisions a month later.\n\nIt sent congress a budget proposal that predicted the government would run a deficit next year.\n\nMs Rousseff's economics team thought the proposal was a strong message to congress, that if legislators didn't help the president cut spending, Brazil's economy would suffer massively.\n\nBut this signal was picked up by the markets instead.\n\nIn September, that decision was the basis for Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade Brazil's economy to junk status.\n\nThe credit ratings agency said the 2016 budget proposal put in doubt the \"government's ability and willingness\" to hold to the policy correction course set out initially by Ms Rousseff.\n\nThe downgrade sped up the real deterioration - as many international funds have rules that ban them from investing in junk-rated countries.\n\nOn 22 September, the Brazilian real reached its lowest-ever value on record. Since May, the Bovespa index has fallen by almost 20%.\n\nCreated in 1994, the real effectively put an end to decades of a disease that corroded the Brazilian economy: hyperinflation.\n\nEvery year from 1942 to 1995, Brazil never had anything less than double-digit inflation per year. In the 1980s and 1990s, it had four-digit inflation.\n\nThe real successfully defeated hyperinflation by keeping itself overvalued against the dollar for a few years. That, coupled with lower tariffs, flooded Brazilian markets with imported goods - and competition forced local producers to keep their prices from climbing.\n\nThe currency went through tough challenges in 1999 and 2003, but authorities managed to stave off pessimism and restore credibility with policies aimed at keeping inflation down.\n\nThe fate of Brazil and its currency depends on how the economic and political crises unfold.\n\nIt is unclear whether President Rousseff will gain political support for her reforms - and even if she succeeds in that, there are still questions of whether her plan will work or not. And Brazil still has to watch out for what happens in China and the US.\n\nIn fact the real has gained some of its value in the past few days, with news that America's Federal Reserve might postpone its interest rate rise for next year.\n\nStill, guessing how many nights a few thousand dollars will buy in the Copacabana Palace for next year's Rio Olympics is a tough challenge right now."
