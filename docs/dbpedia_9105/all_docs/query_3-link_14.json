        "text": "Brazil’s currency, the Brazilian real (BRL), is the official currency of Brazil and is issued by the Central Bank of Brazil. The real replaced the cruzeiro real in 1994. The currency is subdivided into 100 centavos, and its symbol is R$.\n\nBrazilian real denominations of banknotes include R$ 2, R$ 5, R$ 10, R$ 20, R$ 50, R$ 100, and the recently introduced R$ 200 note. In terms of coins, the frequently used denominations are 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos, and the R$ 1 coin. Although there is a 1 centavo coin, it is rarely used in daily transactions.\n\nUnderstanding the Brazilian currency and its exchange rate can be crucial for anyone traveling to or doing business in Brazil. This article provides an overview of the Brazilian Real, Brazil’s official currency. It explores the history and evolution of the Real from its early roots to its current form.\n\nHistorical Journey of Brazil Currency\n\nBrazil has a rich history of currency that dates back to the colonial era. The first official currency of Brazil was the real, which arrived with the Portuguese and Dutch around the mid-17th century.\n\nThe name real means “royal” in Portuguese, and it was also the name of the currency in circulation in Portugal from the 1400s until 1911. Since the earliest colonial days in Brazil, the real was in use.\n\nOver the years, Brazil has seen several changes in its currency. The Brazilian currency has been renamed and redefined several times throughout its history. Since 1994, the official currency is the Brazilian real (plural reais, with symbol R$ and ISO code BRL).\n\nBefore the current real, several currencies were in use, including the Portuguese real from the 16th to 18th centuries, with 1,000 réis called the milréis, the old Brazilian real from 1747 to 1942, with 1,000 réis also called the milréis, and the first cruzeiro from 1942 to 1967, at 1 cruzeiro = 1 milréis or 1,000 réis.\n\nIn 1967, the cruzeiro novo was introduced, and it was replaced by the cruzeiro in 1970. The cruzeiro was replaced by the cruzado in 1986, which was then replaced by the cruzado novo in 1989. The cruzeiro returned in 1990, but it was replaced by the cruzeiro real in 1993, which was then replaced by the current Brazilian real in 1994.\n\nThe Brazilian real has been stable since its introduction, and it has become one of the most traded currencies in the world.\n\nThe real has undergone several devaluations over the years, but it has managed to maintain its value and stability. The currency is widely accepted in Brazil, and it is used for all transactions, including buying goods and services, paying taxes, and investing in the stock market.\n\nHistory of Coins\n\nThe Brazilian real (R$), the official currency of Brazil, is managed by the Central Bank of Brazil and was introduced in 1994 to replace the cruzeiro real. It’s divided into 100 centavos. The real has undergone several historical transformations, originating from the Portuguese real used between the 16th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe modern real was established to stabilize Brazil’s economy through the Plano Real under President Itamar Franco and Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. Initially pegged at 1 real = 1 U.S. dollar, its value has fluctuated over the years, influenced by various economic policies and global market shifts.\n\nBefore the current real, Brazil’s currency evolved from the Portuguese real to the first cruzeiro in 1942, then to the cruzeiro novo, cruzado, cruzado novo, and finally, the cruzeiro real, each replacement attempting to address inflation or economic crisis.\n\nThe introduction of the modern real marked a significant effort in economic stabilization, achieving initial success by curbing hyperinflation and fostering growth.\n\nSince its inception, the real’s value against the dollar has seen ups and downs, reaching a high shortly after its introduction, then experiencing depreciation, particularly during financial crises in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe election of presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and later Jair Bolsonaro further impacted its value through their respective policies and market reactions.\n\nThe real has been issued in various coin series, with the first in 1994 alongside the currency’s launch. These coins were designed to ease the transition from old currencies and address practical needs in the economy, such as the need for small change.\n\nCommemorative coins have also been released, celebrating significant events or figures in Brazilian history. In 1998, a second series was introduced with updated designs and materials to reflect Brazil’s culture and heritage.\n\nDespite the discontinuation of the 1 centavo coin, the currency continues to adapt, reflecting Brazil’s evolving economic landscape.\n\nHistory of Bills\n\nBrazil has two main series of banknotes issued by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil, reflecting the country’s rich biodiversity and technological advancements in currency design.\n\nThe first series, launched in 1994 alongside the introduction of the real, featured banknotes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 reais. To enhance security and reduce counterfeiting, modifications were made over time, including changes in watermarks and the addition of holographic elements on the 20 reais note.\n\nA notable addition to this series was the first polymer banknote of 10 reais in 2000, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival in Brazil. This series also introduced banknotes of 2 and 20 reais, showcasing the sea turtle and the golden lion tamarin, respectively.\n\nThe second series, announced in 2010, aimed at further enhancing security features and incorporating different sizes for each denomination to assist the visually impaired. This series marked a significant design shift, emphasizing Brazil’s economic growth and the need for a secure currency.\n\nThe designs continued to celebrate Brazil’s natural heritage, with imagery of local fauna like the hawksbill turtle, great egret, green-winged macaw, golden lion tamarin, jaguar, dusky grouper, and the newly introduced 200 reais note featuring the maned wolf.\n\nEach note in this series carries a unique watermark corresponding to its main visual theme, reinforcing its security.\n\nIn summary, Brazil’s banknotes not only serve as a medium of exchange but also as a tribute to the country’s environmental richness and a testament to its efforts in combating counterfeiting through technological advancements in currency production.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of Brazil Currency\n\nIf you are planning to travel to Brazil or invest in Brazilian currency, it’s important to understand the country’s inflation rate and how it affects the buying power of the Brazilian Real (BRL).\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Brazil has experienced high inflation rates in the past, with rates reaching as high as 80% per month in the 1990s. However, in recent years, the inflation rate has been more stable, averaging around 4% annually since 2010.\n\nDespite the recent stability, inflation still affects the buying power of the BRL. Inflation can cause prices to rise, making goods and services more expensive. This means that if you are exchanging your currency for BRL, you may be able to buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money over time.\n\nTo see how inflation has affected the buying power of the BRL over time, you can use an inflation calculator. One such calculator, found on in2013dollars.com, shows that the buying power of R$100 in 1980 is equivalent to approximately R$1,900 in 2024.\n\nThis means that if you were to exchange R$100 in 1980 for goods and services, you could buy the same amount of goods and services with approximately R$1,900 in 2024.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that inflation can vary by region and industry. For example, according to the Financial Times, food prices in Brazil have jumped 18.5% in the 12 months to March 2022.\n\nThis means that if you are planning to buy food in Brazil, you may experience higher prices than in other industries or regions.\n\nBrazilian Real\n\nThe second series of Brazilian real banknotes, launched from 2010 onwards, was introduced by the Central Bank of Brazil to incorporate advanced security features and aid the visually impaired with different sizes for each denomination.\n\nThis move aimed to combat counterfeiting and reflect the growing Brazilian economy’s need for a robust and secure currency. The series includes banknotes in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and the newly added 200 reais.\n\nEach banknote showcases Brazil’s rich biodiversity through vibrant colors and themes:\n\n2 reais\n\nThe 2 reais note is blue, featuring a wave pattern head of republic on the front and the hawksbill turtle on the back.\n\n5 reais\n\nThe 5 reais note comes in purple with plant motifs on the front and the great egret on the back.\n\n10 reais\n\nThe 10 reais note is red, displaying plant designs on the front and the green-winged macaw on the back.\n\n20 reais\n\nThe 20 reais note, in yellow, highlights the plant’s head of republic on the front and the golden lion tamarin on the back.\n\n50 reais\n\nThe 50 reais note is brown and displays the Jungle plants; head of Republic on the front and the Jaguar (Panthera onca) on the back.\n\n100 reais\n\nThe 100 reais note, in cyan, depicts underwater scenes and the dusky grouper.\n\n200 reais\n\nThe 200 reais note, in grey and features the Savanna plants; head of Republic on the front and the maned wolf on the back.\n\nThese banknotes coexist with the older series, symbolizing Brazil’s commitment to economic stability and environmental preservation.\n\nCurrency Usage in Brazil\n\nIf you’re planning to travel to Brazil, you’ll need to know about the country’s currency. The official currency of Brazil is the Brazilian real (BRL), which is divided into 100 centavos. The Central Bank of Brazil is the issuing authority for the currency.\n\nIs USD accepted in Brazil?\n\nWhile the US dollar is widely accepted in some tourist areas, it’s still a good idea to have Brazilian real on hand. Many places, especially outside of major cities, may not accept USD or may offer a poor exchange rate.\n\nIt’s also important to note that some establishments may only accept cash, so it’s a good idea to carry some cash with you at all times.\n\nYou can exchange currency at banks, exchange offices, or at the airport. It’s important to compare exchange rates and fees to get the best deal.

You can exchange your currency at banks, exchange houses, and airports. Banks typically offer better exchange rates, but they may have limited hours of operation.\n\nExchange houses are open for longer hours, but their exchange rates may not be as favorable as banks.
