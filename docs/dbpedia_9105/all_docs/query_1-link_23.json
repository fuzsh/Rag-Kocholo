        "text": "Brazil is home to 203 million people with a real GDP per capita of US$8,802 in 2022. It is a large federal country comprised of the union (federal government), 26 states (plus the Federal District), and over 5,500 municipalities. While it is highly diverse, racial and gender discrimination persist as systemic barriers that limit the opportunities of many individuals and families to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty.\n\nIts people live in multiple ecosystems across a landmass of 8.5 million km2 (about the size of the continental United States), with sharp differences in race, history, culture, and industry manifesting many “Brazils.” The country’s overall Human Capital Index (HCI) shows that Brazilian children born today will have, as adults, only 55 percent of the productivity they would have had with full access to quality health and education opportunities. Factoring in adult unemployment, their productivity falls to 33 percent, implying that 67 percent of Brazil’s talent is lost to society.\n\nAfro-Brazilians and Indigenous Peoples have less access to good-quality schools and health services than whites, and women face job discrimination that limits their earning potential far more than men. Even before COVID, some areas of Brazil had an HCI at around 40 percent (e.g., in the North and Northeast regions), akin to what can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa, while others (e.g., in the richer Southeast of Brazil) had HCI levels around 70 percent, on par with countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nBrazil’s real GDP expanded 2.9 percent in 2023 driven by robust private consumption, still supported by a strong labor market and fiscal stimulus to social transfers, and by a favorable external environment benefiting exports. In 2024, GDP is expected to grow by 1.7 percent, driven by the delayed effects of monetary tightening and a lower carry-over effect for the year. Inflation will gradually converge towards 3.5 percent by 2025, slightly above the Central Bank’s target of 3 percent (+/-1.5 percentage points) but allowing for a gradual easing of monetary policy and contributing to a recovery of growth in 2025 (2.2 percent).\n\nGoing forward, real GDP growth is expected to moderate to about 2 percent in the medium term. Poverty, measured at the US$6.85 per capita per day poverty line, decreased from 23.5 percent in 2022 to 21.3 percent in 2023, explained by improvements in economic conditions and social protection policies such as the Bolsa Familia program.\n\nBrazil’s macroeconomic buffers remain solid, with large international reserves, low external debt, a credible central bank, a resilient financial system, and exchange rate flexibility. In addition, Brazil initiated the first phase of a long-awaited reform of indirect taxes, whose further legislation will be elaborated in 2024. The indirect tax reform is expected to improve the business environment through tax simplification and to boost productivity.\n\nHowever, the general government primary deficit reached 2.3 percent of GDP in 2023, from a surplus of 1.2 percent in 2022, while debt stands at 74.3 percent of GDP, up from 71.7 percent in 2022. Structural challenges for the Brazilian economy include a still complex tax system, a cumbersome business environment that discourages entrepreneurship, low savings and infrastructure investments, and limited integration in global markets that curb innovation and hinder competitiveness. Aging related challenges, particularly in health and pensions, are projected to put pressure on public finances.\n\nAchieving higher levels of productivity and sustainable growth remain a key challenge that has become more urgent and will require bolder action. Productivity growth in manufacturing and services has been stagnant for 20 years and growth projections remain below upper middle-income country peers. While the agriculture sector registered productivity gains (through investments in innovation, technology, and trade logistic, as well as sector-specific government incentives) and sustained Brazil’s position as the world’s third-largest agricultural and food exporter, part of this success relied on extensive farming methods that threaten important biomes and biodiversity.\n\nOverall, it is now clear that Brazil cannot rely on commodity booms and greater inputs of land and labor to reach high-income status. Instead, it needs to shift away from factor accumulation towards a low-carbon productivity-led growth model that is driven by high-quality education and modern infrastructure, including digital, to create more and better jobs. Brazil could also act as a global innovation hub through more competition, higher openness to trade, and integration with regional and global value chains.\n\nA more conducive business environment would attract greater private investment in industries and in the climate transition. Despite the financial system’s development, further progress is needed to increase its efficiency. Finally, Brazil could empower its entire workforce to contribute and benefit further, especially by easing the systemic barriers that limit capital accumulation and job opportunities among Afro-Brazilians, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth.\n\nMoreover, Brazil’s natural endowments position it well to exploit new growth opportunities as the world shifts to low-carbon economic sectors and markets. Since three-quarters of Brazil’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from land-use change and agriculture, stopping deforestation and transitioning towards low-carbon agriculture is a priority.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is now near a tipping point beyond which it might not generate enough rainfall to sustain its own ecosystem or the agriculture, hydropower, water supply, and industries that have fueled Brazil’s growth, or the environmental services that it provides to the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the rest of the world. Efforts to stop deforestation in the Amazon cannot result in more deforestation in other biomes like the Cerrado, as they are also important for similar reasons.\n\nThe agriculture sector has scope to curb deforestation and scale-up climate-smart land use while raising its productivity further. In addition, given its low-carbon energy matrix, Brazil can decarbonize transport, industry, and cities (“deep decarbonization”) at a very low net cost of about 0.5 percent of GDP per annum above “business as usual” costs, on average, between now and 2050. Doing so would position Brazil extremely well to integrate its businesses into the green economy of the future.\n\nSignificant progress is within reach, but time is of the essence. The current government brought renewed political will, a strong reform agenda, and ambitious development programs to fight hunger and inequality, promote social justice, re-industrialize Brazil, and embrace a greener economy. It is committed to reaching zero illegal deforestation by 2030 and has launched an ambitious Ecological Transformation Plan (ETP) to promote inclusive and sustainable development while tackling climate change. The ETP’s goals are to boost productivity and generate well-paid green jobs, to reduce the economy’s environmental footprint, and to promote equitable development through better income distribution and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, significant progress will require sustained efforts and strong buy-in among key actors, including in the private sector, in a way that transcends political divisions and election cycles. If successful, the programs, policies and reforms adopted now would help strengthen Brazil’s productive structure and technological innovations in the short-term while also generating stronger foundations for the longer-term.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 05, 2024\n\nProgress in Brazil would enhance livability in the rest of the world, and vice-versa. The World Bank is committed to supporting Brazil’s goals of accelerating productivity growth and reducing high levels of poverty and inequality in a fiscally and environmentally sustainable way, thus building a future with opportunities for all while meeting Brazil’s potential as a leader in green and climate-friendly development. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) portfolio stands at $5 billion and includes 26 investment projects ($3,101.9m), three program for results operations ($610m), and four development policy operations ($1,282.53m).\n\nBolder support to Brazil, through financing, knowledge, support to institutions and private capital mobilization, is timely. It will build on the World Bank Group’s expanded vision and mission – ending poverty on a livable planet –, new playbook, and increased financing capacity, as set out at the 2023 Annual Meetings. Brazil is uniquely positioned to benefit from this transformation through World Bank Group engagements that promote scale and replicability, strengthen the effective uses of domestic resources, mobilize more private capital, enhance knowledge delivery, and leverage renewed partnerships.\n\nThe Brazil Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY24-28 (July 2024 – June 2028) is tailored to maximize these opportunities. Lending from the IBRD is expected to average about $2 billion per year and financing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to exceed US$ 5 billion a year. Guarantees from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) are also expected to grow. Demand for World Bank Group support is high. Brazil is IFC’s largest client (the portfolio reached US$ 7.2 billion in November 2023), with a thriving and sophisticated capital market that makes it a solutions lab for climate finance and public-private partnerships (PPPs).\n\nRequests for IBRD financing from states and municipalities and federal ministries, which articulate demand in Brazil’s federal structure, consistently exceed the volume of federal guarantees that the Union allocates to international finance institutions (IFIs) to enable borrowing. This “bottom-up” articulation of client demand for IBRD financing, together with Brazil’s wide range of development challenges, demands new approaches in programming and a bolder articulation of joint WBG work to mobilize private capital and enhance markets. While investor demand for MIGA’s guarantees has been low (total gross exposure was $101 million in March 2024), given low political risks and well-developed capital markets, new opportunities may arise in this CPF period, particularly in support of public banks and subnational entities.\n\nThe previous CPF covered FY18-23, with important adjustments made in the 2022 Performance and Learning Review (PLR) to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This new CPF will support the priorities of the current administration, as laid out in its Pluriannual Plan (PPA) for 2024-2027 and the ETP, and the ambitions of the Brazilian private sector to take a lead on the global stage.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 05, 2024\n\nBrazil’s partnership with the World Bank Group (WBG) spans decades of groundbreaking collaborations since the first loan, in 1949, in support of hydroelectric power facilities that since made Brazil one of the world’s leaders in low-carbon electricity supply. Over time, transformational support from the WBG extended well beyond the scope of its financing and spanned the three interrelated “Ps” of People, Prosperity, and Planet, as follows.\n\nPeople\n\nWB support had significant influence on:\n\n(i) Brazil’s flagship conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa Família, which lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty since 2003 and continues to be at the cutting edge of crisis response and transparency;\n\n(ii) Ceará State’s pioneering approach to transforming education quality, including through robust learning assessments and results-based financing, which has inspired other countries and Brazil’s federal government to attempt to follow suit;\n\n(iii) The inclusive provision of quality health services through a Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS), one of the most advanced public health systems in the world.\n\nThe World Bank also helped to pioneer sustainable opportunities for Indigenous Peoples, traditional communities, Afro-Brazilians, women, and youth with important breakthroughs in legislation – on social accountability, violence prevention, and the narrowing of racial and gender gaps – that can now be scaled up.\n\nProsperity\n\nThe WBG supported Brazil’s first public-private partnership (PPP) as part of an expansion of São Paulo’s Metro Line 4. Since then, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) have supported a substantial PPP program in Brazil that unlocked at least US$8.5 billion in private investments over the last 10 years, with innovative and impactful PPP models that include the ambitious highway concession program in the State of São Paulo, municipal street lighting across several states, and the Paraná Roads program. These programs have significantly improved urban mobility, services and market access.\n\nOver the years, World Bank’s analytical work and technical assistance also contributed to advancing Brazil’s fiscal and structural reforms, such as trade policies; the 2019 pension reform; the federal system for rating state capacity to repay loans (“CAPAG”), which helped to establish sub-national borrowing limits since 2017; and the recently approved indirect tax reform.\n\nPlanet\n\nWorld Bank support in the Amazon region since the 1990s contributed to the demarcation of indigenous lands in a total area the size of Sweden; the establishment of community-managed extractive reserves; greater adoption of certified forest management approaches; significant institutional strengthening at both federal and state levels; and participatory approaches across hundreds of communities and civil society organizations.\n\nAcknowledging the critical importance of other ecosystems, the WB has also been a leading partner in the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes through national and state-level lending programs and grant funding activities to support sustainable water management, agriculture and livestock, environmental regularization, natural resource management, and land use and landscape management.\n\nIn parallel, IFC pioneered innovative instruments for sustainable finance in Brazil, including the first sustainability-linked loan for the waste management sector across emerging markets, the first blue loan in Latin America and the Caribbean, the first super green loan through Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)-linked financing, the first social bond, the first loan to a trading company with zero deforestation commitment and a groundbreaking mechanism for currency risk sharing in road concessions.\n\nIn late 2023, Brazil issued its first sovereign sustainability bond (a $2 billion 7-year bond at 6.5 percent coupon rate) under a framework articulated with support from the WBG and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which provides a blueprint for sovereign issuances and unlocks potential for new forms of private capital mobilization and sustainable finance.\n\nThe Progestão series, now approved in five states and with several others under preparation under a multiphase programmatic approach, supports fiscal efficiency gains across key sectors and whole-of-government functions. Other projects under implementation or preparation (e.g., with the city of Rio de Janeiro and the States of Sergipe and Alagoas) contribute to this agenda through reforms to strengthen fiscal management.\n\nThe WBG will continue to focus its efforts on engagements where it may be able to achieve levels of influence and impact that go beyond the size of its financing.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 05, 2024"
