As such, the availability of resources may vary from a transfer period to another. The coverage of FDIC insurance is limited to USD 250,000 per depositor, per ownership category, per banking institution and the bank providing such coverage is Community Federal Savings Bank, Member FDIC.

Nomad Fintech Inc is headquartered in the United States, is registered at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) as an Investment Adviser, providing its services exclusively in the United States and related to investment products from the United States. Nomad Fintech Inc is not authorized by the Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission to offer direct services of securities distribution to resident investors, domiciled or incorporated into the Federative Republic of Brazil, the reason being why no reference here stated should be understood as a direct service offer to these investors.\n\nâ\n\nThus, based on the CVM Guiding Opinion number 33/2005, Nomad Fintech Inc (\"Nomad\") holds a contract with a regulated institution in Brazil, which is part of the Brazilian security distribution, duly authorized by the Brazilian Federal Bank (Banco Central do Brasil - \"Bacen\") and the Security Exchange Commission (ComissÃ£o de Valores MobiliÃ¡rios - \"CVM\"), Global Investment Services DTVM Ltda., registered CNPJ/ME number 47.227.569/0001-58 (the âBrazilian partnerâ or âGlobal DTVMâ), by which it offers the access to Nomad's Services to investors who are resident, domiciled or incorporated by the Federative Republic of Brazil. The services offered by the Brazilian Partner should not be considered securities offered to these investors. Nomad provides its services exclusively in the United States and under the rules and regulations applicable to the U.S. Such services were not registered or are subjected to CVM's supervision or another Brazilian regulation institution. To register complaints or ask for support, clients who are residents or domiciled in Brazil who happen to become Nomad's clients through the intermediation of the Brazilian Partner, are welcome to contact us at support@nomadglobal.com or +55 (11) 4200-0204 (Brazil) / +1 (888) 998-2261 (USA).\n\nCertain investment services in the United States are offered by DriveWealth LLC, a member of FINRA and SIPC. SIPC is an institution that protects customers' accounts up to US$500,000 (five hundred thousand American dollars), including US$250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand dollars) in cash payment requests. To learn more about SIPC, go to www.sipc.org. The insurance provided by SIPC does not cover the funds deposited on DriveWealth. Banking deposits are not covered by SIPC. Your investments are kept in an individual account on DriveWealth. Check this company's register on BrokerCheck, a FINRA managed tool. Although Nomad carefully checks the potential gains based on the market's current and historical events development, we do not make any representation as to the probability that any real or proposed allocation will in fact reach a determined result of the investment objective. Past performances are not guaranteed a future outcome and the volatility means that eventual gains in any given period can be significantly higher or lower if compared to a previous period. Some clients may have investment outcomes materially different from those that we eventually indicate in one of our investment tools. Investments in Nomad can lose market value. Nomad is not capable of predicting the market fluctuations or other external uncertainties that can affect the value of any investment. The predictions indicated in each model are inherently limited since it does not represent economic or market factors that could have had an impact and affect our recommendations.\n\nIn order to obtain useful investment guidance, as an individual, you must carefully consider the adaptation of the suggested portfolios in light of your own financial circumstances, including needs of cash flow, fiscal needs, investment profile, and other subjective factors. It is recommended that you use all available resources to inform yourself about investments in general, as well as investments and the overall composition of your portfolio. Besides, both the market conditions and your own financial circumstances can shift over time â perhaps suddenly or gradually. Managing and adjusting to these conditions to adapt yourself to these circumstances is your responsibility, and you should reassess any investment program regularly to make sure it is still consistent considering your current financial resources and investment addressed to future objectives. In addition to that, recommendations of fiscal or tax nature related to the investments made through Nomad must be obtained by the client, who must assess the possible impacts arising from these issues before deciding on a given investment. Investing in securities involves risks, including possible losses. Investments based on a currency that is not the same as the investor can be impacted by changes in exchange fee taxes, resulting in an undesired effect on the value, price, or revenue generated by the investment.\n\nTrademarks, logos, and service brands that are part of the Services, including, among others, the trademark \"Nomad\", are trademarks registered and service brands from Nomad.
