Foreigners should come next.\n\nThe currency , which saw wild swings for most of the past decade as constant political turmoil rippled through markets and the economy, has been stuck between 4.84 and 5 per dollar since mid-2023. The odd calm — a result of relative political stability and still-high interest rates — is paving the way for the real to become one of the main destinations for emerging-market investors."
