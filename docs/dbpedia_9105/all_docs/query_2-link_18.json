I recall visiting Rio de Janeiro in the early 1990s and experiencing hyperinflation. I tried to hold most of my money in dollars; if I came into possession of some Brazilian currency, then called the Cruzeiro Real, I made sure to spend it right away. In 1990, the rate of inflation in Brazil was 2,948%."
