        "text": "<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><head><title>POLL-Brazil real forecast downgraded to weakest in one year</title></head><body>\n\nBy Gabriel Burin\n\nBUENOS AIRES, June 5 (Reuters) -The 12-month consensus forecast for the Brazilian real currency was downgraded to the weakest in one year in a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists, suggesting its recent decline may become a longer-term issue, rather than a passing trend.\n\nThe currency has been losing ground since the start of 2024, hit by increasing fiscal worries and a drop in speculative flows due to a reduction of spreads between Brazilian and U.S. interest rates.\n\nThe real BRL=, BRBY is seen trading at 5.05 per U.S. dollar in one year, according to the median forecast of 31 strategists polled May 31-June 4. Views ranged from 4.70 to 5.29 per dollar.\n\nOn one hand, the latest consensus estimate would imply a 4% appreciation from 5.25 reais per dollar on Monday. However, it was the softest since a 5.14 estimate in June 2023, indicating a continuation of sentiment deterioration that began in April.\n\n\"The BRL is still subject to volatility movements as long as local fiscal uncertainty persists in a context where the Fed is not close to starting a monetary easing cycle,\" Rabobank analysts wrote in a report.\n\n\"Furthermore, local fiscal/election calendars and a lower marginal inflow of dollars from foreign trade this year add forces of depreciation to the BRL, especially in the first half of 2024.\"\n\nBrazil's central government posted a lower-than-expected primary budget surplus for April. That, along with a rise in the public debt, added to a raft of disappointing fiscal results that continue to obscure the outlook for consumer prices.\n\nThe central bank delivered a smaller rate cut last month to cool off inflation expectations, but it was insufficient to alleviate concerns about diminishing rate differentials as the U.S. Federal Reserve holds its stance.\n\nYear-to-date, the real is down 7.6%. The Mexican peso MXN= followed suit with a 4.1% depreciation, logged almost entirely on Monday after the ruling party scored a surprisingly strong election that shook domestic markets.\n\nSome fear Claudia Sheinbaum's landslide victory in Sunday's presidential vote would pave the way for the government coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support.\n\n\"The new administration formally takes office on 1 October; appointments, policy signals, 2025 budget by August...answers to rising concerns will only be gradual,\" said Alejandro Cuadrado, strategist and global head of FX at BBVA.\n\n\"Among the potential reform list nothing screams to push Mexico fundamentally off a cliff, but they can drive some institutional erosion and some can have some economic and/or financial impact including energy reform and pensions.\"\n\nIn one year, the peso is expected to trade at 17.97 per dollar, or 1.7% softer than on Monday. Still, that would be stronger than any of the values it saw most of the time since 2016. A majority of forecasts were provided before the election.\n\n(For other stories from the May Reuters foreign exchange poll: nL4N3I132T)\n\n</body></html>"
