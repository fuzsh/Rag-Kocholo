        "text": "The Brazilian real (BRL) is the official currency of Brazil, a large country located in South America.\n\nThe real has been the country’s official currency since 1994, when it replaced the cruzeiro real.\n\nThe Brazilian real is subdivided into 100 centavos and is symbolized by the “R$” sign.\n\nIt is a floating currency, which means that its value is determined by market forces of supply and demand, and it is not pegged to any other currency.\n\nThe Brazilian economy is one of the largest in the world and is diverse, with major industries including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services.\n\nFluctuations in these industries can affect the value of the real, as can changes in the global economic climate.\n\nThe Central Bank of Brazil is responsible for managing the monetary policy and issuing currency in Brazil.\n\nVisitors to Brazil can usually exchange their foreign currency for real at banks, exchange bureaus, and some hotels and airports.\n\nIt is worth noting that credit and debit cards are widely accepted in major cities, but may not be accepted in rural areas."
