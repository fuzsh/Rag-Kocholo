The Brazilian currency system has undergone significant change throughout its history; the current currency, the Real, is an example of great success. It first came into circulation in July 1994 and replaced the Cruzeiro Real, which had lasted only ten months.

The Real draws its name from the pre-1942 currency and stabilised the Brazilian economy by putting an end to soaring inflation rates, balance-of-payment crises and wild fluctuations in currency value.

Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Brazilian currency history was largely defined by influence from Portugal and the Netherlands. All coins issued prior to 1694 had been manufactured overseas, with some bearing the Dutch West India Company mark and others showing the word ‘Brasil’ on one side.

In 1694, King Peter II established the first Brazilian mint to allow for domestically produced coins, and notes were then issued in 1835 through Brazil’s Treasury Department. This saw a decentralisation of power over Brazil’s monetary system, transitioning away from earlier colonisation influence.

Since 1965, Banco Central do Brasil (Central Bank of Brazil) has had a monopoly over issuing Brazilian currency and providing currency services within the nation’s borders.

The economic turnaround experienced in Brazil after the introduction of the Real as its legal tender in 1994 was remarkable. Prior to this period, the Brazilian economy had been crippled by a period of extreme hyperinflation that left consumers and companies alike struggling to manage their finances.

The resulting rapid devaluation of Brazilian currency meant that shoppers would run to supermarkets as soon as they got paid in order to spend their cash before it lost purchasing power.

Businesses found it almost impossible to accurately anticipate production costs amidst a climate of daily price hikes, while the annual rate of inflation had surpassed 2,500% at its peak.

As part of a successful plan to put an end to this turbulent period, the Real was introduced and achieved instant success in stabilising the country’s economy.

If you’re planning a trip to Brazil, it’s important to familiarise yourself with the local customs. This includes understanding when and how much it’s customary to tip. To help you out, we’ve put together a simple guide to tipping in Brazil.

Restaurants: In most restaurants in Brazil, a 10% “servico” charge is added to your bill. This amount is for the staff at the restaurant, and it’s considered customary for customers to pay this service charge. That said, there is no legal obligation for customers to pay this fee.

Taxi: Tipping taxi drivers in Brazil is not expected, but they are accustomed to receiving tips if they provide good service. As with most transactions here, however, they will likely expect payment in exact change – or rounded up to the nearest real.

Hotel: Just like any other hospitality service industry, it’s customary to tip hotel staff like room service personnel, maids and bellboys. The usual rate is R$7-10 (roughly AUD $2-3), depending on the level of service received.

Hair Salon & Spa: Generally speaking, a 10-15% tip is expected in hair salons and spas. However, some places might include this amount as part of the bill. It’s best to ask beforehand if this is the case.

Tour Guides: Having a qualified tour guide in Brazil can be the difference between an extraordinary and lacklustre experience. If you’re lucky enough to find yourself with an outstanding guide, do not hesitate to show your appreciation by tipping them 10%, regardless if it’s for a private, multi-day or walking tour. Not only will your gesture of gratitude make their day but it also ensures that they continue providing the same high standard of service!
