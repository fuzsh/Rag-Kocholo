The Brazilian real (BRL) is the official currency of Brazil, a large country located in South America.

The real has been the country’s official currency since 1994, when it replaced the cruzeiro real.

The Brazilian real is subdivided into 100 centavos and is symbolized by the “R$” sign.

It is a floating currency, which means that its value is determined by market forces of supply and demand, and it is not pegged to any other currency.

The Brazilian economy is one of the largest in the world and is diverse, with major industries including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services.

Fluctuations in these industries can affect the value of the real, as can changes in the global economic climate.

The Central Bank of Brazil is responsible for managing the monetary policy and issuing currency in Brazil.

Visitors to Brazil can usually exchange their foreign currency for real at banks, exchange bureaus, and some hotels and airports.

It is worth noting that credit and debit cards are widely accepted in major cities, but may not be accepted in rural areas.
