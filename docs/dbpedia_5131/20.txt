About Håkan Karlsson

Håkan Karlsson (b. 1962). I am professor and Vice Head of the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. My major focus of research is the epistemology and ontology of archaeology, the contemporary political dimensions of archaeology, the relationship between heritage management and the public, and the archaeology of the contemporary past. I have written several books and articles as well as co-editing a number of books on these topics. At present I am co-leader of a number of contemporary archaeological projects in Cuba, India and Sweden that, in co-operation with local communities, approaches different kinds of material and immaterial remains from, for example, former Soviet nuclear sites (Cuba) and industrial disasters in the third world (India and Thailand). I am also co-leader of a project discussing the authenticity, staging and public communication of world heritage classified rock art sites in Australia, Argentina, India, Italy, Mexico, Tanzania and Sweden.
