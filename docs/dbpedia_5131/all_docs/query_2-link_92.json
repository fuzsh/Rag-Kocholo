Come to our booth SA045 in the passage between halls 4 and 5 to meet Hakan Karlsson, J√∂rgen Kamph and Klelia Karagiannaki and taste some coffee with oat drink made with Cerealiq AB technology! We are happy to share our booth with Biostar PPHU Witold Krusz, who can guide you through an efficient production of plant-based dairy. #oatmilk\n\nMeet our Quality Manager, Evelina √ñsterblad! During her BSc in Gastronomy at H√∂gskolan in Kristianstad Evelina engaged with a wide variety of courses such as HACCP, Food Chemistry and Nutrition. Having then worked as a chef, including raw food applications, she experienced this knowledge in practice and got inspired to create delicious food by adding only a few ingredients. Evelina started working with Quality Assurance in 2014, as a third-party Food Auditor at Valiguard/SAI Global. During this role, she had responsibility for more than 150 restaurants all over Scandinavia and she gained expertise in Food Quality, Food Safety, Hygiene and Education of employees - assets she brought when she joined Cerealiq AB almost a year ago. Today, she spends most of her time working on the #FSSC 22000 certification, making sure that our enzyme mixing facility meets the highest quality standards ü§© . This means building and continuously improving routines, educating the employees, and keeping track of all necessary documentation. Her favourite way to enjoy oat drink is by adding spices for a heart-warming cup of ‚Äúgolden latte‚Äù, or when raw-inspired baking at home for her family! #team #oatmilk\n\nMeet our Product Developer, Klelia Karagiannaki! As a Dietitian with an MSc degree in Food Innovation and Product Design (FIPDes), Klelia is passionate about plant-based development, aiming to prioritise the health of humans, animals, and the planet. Her experience in Dietetics and Nutrition Education, Research, and Recipe and Product Development brings an integral scope to the development of food products. Since she joined Cerealiq AB, she has been working hands-on with developing new enzyme systems and products, tailored to our customers‚Äô needs. In other words, making several litres of plant-based drinks every day! Upon transferring the product from the laboratory to a full-production scale, she plans and performs all the needed shelf-life analyses to ensure optimum taste and functionality. Klelia also spends a lot of time reading scientific articles, attending webinars, and following the trends in the plant-based market, often bringing interesting products for the team to taste and test. She is privileged to taste all the drinks warm straight from the trials, which is when she enjoys them the most üòá ! -photo by Rebecca Mattsoff, who invited Klelia to speak about her role in Cerealiq at an entrepreneurship boot camp at VentureLab by Lund University- #team #oatmilk\n\nMeet our CTO, Emilie Sellman! Emilie has been working in the food industry since she finished her MSc degree in Biotechnology in 2006. In her career as Development Engineer, Product Developer and Project Leader in companies such as Culinar, Oatly and Findus, she has been involved in all development stages of a wide range of food products. Her solid experience in the development of plant-based drinks was one of the reasons Cerealiq AB was born in 2018. Emilie co-founded the company and brought her deep knowledge of enzymes and food processing to adapt to customer needs and help them reach their goals. In other words, the recipe for producing the best oat drink! In daily business, she spends most of her time leading forward the development of new enzyme mixes and making sure the enzyme mixing facility runs smoothly. Emilie is also the owner of Trixie, the office dog, which provides the most loving and playful breaks for the employees üê∂ ‚ù§Ô∏è Her favourite way of enjoying oat drink is pouring its warm froth into espresso coffee ‚òï . The second place takes overnight oats with raspberries and cardamom. #team #oatmilk\n\nMeet our Sales Manager, J√∂rgen Kamph! J√∂rgen has robust experience in Marketing and Sales for more than 30 years in the food industry, in organisations such as Guldf√•geln, and Tetra Pak. From 2014 to 2022 he worked as Head of Marketing and Sales at Trensums Food, where he got acquainted with plant-based drinks and developed a wide understanding of such food processing and packaging. Since 2021, he has been working as a consultant, focused on business development in food technology and liquid food production. His experience and network are vital for Cerealiq AB to grow and spread its values for efficient and nutritious plant-based drinks. At the same time, he also assists potential and existing customers in finding the right enzyme technology from Cerealiq‚Äôs portfolio to optimise their products and ensure success in the marketplace. J√∂rgen and his family love to use oat drink in cooking and baking ü•û #team #oatmilk\n\nMeet our Senior Advisor and Chairwoman of the Board, Angie Triantafyllou! During her Ph.D. work in Biotechnology at Lund University, Angie specialised in Enzyme Technology. She is the inventor of several patents and co-founder of Oatly where she worked for 23 years, completing her contribution as Head of Research.
