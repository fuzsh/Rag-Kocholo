        "text": "Rooted in an agricultural past and propelled into the future through innovation, Sweden is multifaceted and perhaps contradictory. 'Sweden – a country less ordinary' shows that it is a country where booming businesses meet a tax-funded welfare system. It is where gender equality has made great strides – with paid ‘daddy leave’ being one example – but also a country where women only got to vote for the first time in 1921. While high energy consumption gets Sweden through the winter, the country is at the forefront of sustainable development. This is a book about Sweden from midwinter to midsummer, from sustainability to superstars, from government to gaming. Sweden – a country less ordinary just might surprise you.
