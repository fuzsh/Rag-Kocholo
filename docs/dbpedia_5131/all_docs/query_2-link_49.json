        "text": "This book presents a detailed analysis of the U.S. policy that was adopted toward Cuba by the Richard M. Nixon administration between January 20, 1969, and August 8, 1974. Based on governmental, as well as other, sources from both the U.S. and Cuba, this book examines the rupture where the policy of “passive containment” was complemented with a policy of “dirty war.” President Nixon attempted to reestablish a confrontational and violent path of action, and once again, Cuba was exposed to a “dirty war” consisting of different forms of aggressive terrorist activities. Since the conditions for this violent route had changed dramatically both in the U.S. and in Cuba, a policy characterized by a continuity of the economic and psychological warfare came to be the central one for the Nixon administration. This book is unique since it is written from a Cuban perspective, and it therefore complements and enriches the knowledge of the U.S.–Cuban relationship during the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, and the policy adopted by the Nixon administration. It is of relevance to everyone interested in the issue, and especially for students and researchers within the disciplines of history and political science.\n\nPART I\n\nThe Context 1\n\n1 From Saigon to Havana 3\n\nPART II\n\nThe Nixon Administration’s Policy toward Cuba 35\n\n2 “A Very, Very Cautious Probe Only” 39\n\n3 CIA’s Covert Operations and the Use of Cuban Exiles 44\n\n4 The Anti-Cuban Policy of the U.S. 53\n\n5 Debate in the U.S. National Security Council 71\n\nPART III\n\nThe CIA and the Secret Economic War against Cuba, and a New “Missile Crisis” (1969–1970) 79\n\n6 The Cuban Exiles in the CIA Plans 80\n\n7 The “Crisis” of the Soviet Nuclear Submarines 98\n\nPART IV\n\nOther Secret Actions toward Cuba 115\n\n8 Psychological Warfare: Radio Broadcasts 118\n\n9 Pirate Warfare: Harassment of Fishermen 123\n\n10 Biological Warfare: The African Swine Fever 133\n\nPART V\n\nThe Decline of the Counterrevolutionary Groups 145\n\n11 The Failure of the Torriente Plan 146\n\n12 The Crisis of the “Mother Ships” 154\n\n13 Assassination Plots toward Fidel Castro 174\n\nPART VI\n\nThe U.S.–Cuba Agreement on the Hijacking of Aircrafts, Sea Vessels and Other Offenses 181\n\n14 Air and Sea Hijackings: A Double-Edged Sword for the U.S. 183\n\n15 The Failed Negotiations between Cuba and the U.S. 199\n\n16 The Agreement of 1973 211\n\nPART VII\n\nThe Debacle of a President 221\n\n17 Debates in the Congress (1973–1974) 225\n\n18 Continued Terrorism 236\n\n19 Watergate: Nixon’s Fall and the Cuban Connection 245\n\nBiography\n\nHåkan Karlsson (born 1962) is Full Professor of archeology at the Department of Historical Studies, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
