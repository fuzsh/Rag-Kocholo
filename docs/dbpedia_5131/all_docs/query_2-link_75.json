        "text": "This research paper follows the evolution of US American policy towards Cuba from 1959 to present with a brief mention of historical trends. Throughout the text, the case is made that an embargo against Cuba is an erroneous policy to pursue. The general use and failure of sanctions is addressed and their efficacy questioned. Through the international support of UN General Assembly resolutions, it is shown that the embargo is unpopular. By comparison with the approaches of other countries, it is argued that the objectives of the USA’s policies could be better achieved through engagement with Cuba. The implications of the Helms-Burton Act brought forth and discussed. All through these topics, reasons are listed to justify the lifting of the trade blockade against Cuba.\n\nThe article seeks to analyze the role of the changes introduced by the administration of the former president Barack Obama in 2014—2016 into the bilateral US-Cuba relations; and the way in which the new presidential team are to reorganize this direction. The question on the attitude of Donald Trump towards currently existing policies aimed at solving the long-lasting problem with Cuban socialism is especially interesting since new US president has multiple times condemned the old ways practiced by the former establishment, but at the same time has shown readiness to act in a straightforward and confrontational manner. One of contributors of the paper, Santiago Perez Benitez, deputy director of the Center for International Political Studies in Havana, is attempting to provide his professional expertise in granting an insider view from the Cuban side, evaluating the progress made since the 2014 and interpret the notion of the upcoming policy changes in Washington. The importance of the Cuban issue in the framework of US. policy in the Western hemisphere is explained by the fact that a solution in this sphere could help remake a negative image of Pan-American policies that haunts Washington. Cuban issue has also been long considered a possible key for reestablish-ment of trust between the United States and Latin American countries. For president Trump, quite unpopular judging by the polls, Cuban issue also has a potential to earn support of his own constituents, who strongly support lifting the embargo from Cuba. However now after certain decisions of Donald Trump the future of US-Cuban relations seems to get gloomier by the day.\n\nCuba is probably one of the best examples of the significance of the democracy promotion discourse in US foreign policy: the efforts to democratise the island have been one of the main features in the US–Cuba bilateral relations since the end of the Cold War. even the embargo against the island has evolved from a tool to generate regime change to an instrument of democracy promotion to foster a democratic transition. today, the Cuban embargo, after the codifications of the 1990s, is intimately connected to a ‘Cuban democratic future’. moreover, in the last three decades, US presidents have committed themselves to promote democracy on the island, inaugurating a sort of ‘state policy’ with little or no evolutions or changes. the main aim of this two-part article is to explore the rationale behind US decennial efforts to promote a peaceful democratic change on the island, while trying to answer some crucial questions about US strategy in Cuba: Why promote democracy in Cuba? Why did democracy promotion become a long-lasting feature in US–Cuba relations? the first part deals with the security framework, and american economic interests in Cuba as a crucial push factor for democracy promotion, while the role of the Cuban-american community and the problems and perspectives of US strategy will be included in the second part, to be published in the next issue of the Journal."
