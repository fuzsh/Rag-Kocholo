        "meta_description": "Abstract. The Arctic is a rapidly changing ecosystem, with complex iceâoceanâatmosphere feedbacks. An important process is new particle formation (NPF), from gas-phase precursors, which provides a climate forcing effect. NPF has been studied comprehensively at different sites in the Arctic, ranging from those in the High Arctic and those at Svalbard to those in the continental Arctic, but no harmonised analysis has been performed on all sites simultaneously, with no calculations of key NPF parameters available for some sites. Here, we analyse the formation and growth of new particles from six long-term ground-based stations in the Arctic (Alert, Villum, Tiksi, Zeppelin Mountain, Gruvebadet, and UtqiaÄ¡vik). Our analysis of particle formation and growth rates in addition to back-trajectory analysis shows a summertime maxima in the frequency of NPF and particle formation rate at all sites, although the mean frequency and particle formation rates themselves vary greatly between sites, with the highest at Svalbard and lowest in the High Arctic. The summertime growth rate, condensational sinks, and vapour source rates show a slight bias towards the southernmost sites, with vapour source rates varying by around an order of magnitude\nbetween the northernmost and southernmost sites. Air masses back-trajectories during NPF at these northernmost sites are associated with large areas of sea ice and snow, whereas events at Svalbard are associated with more sea ice and ocean regions. Events at the southernmost sites are associated with large areas of land and sea ice. These results emphasise how understanding the geographical variation in surface type across the Arctic is key to understanding secondary aerosol sources and providing a harmonised analysis of NPF across the Arctic.",

Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM.\n\nInsights into the sources of ultrafine particle numbers at six European urban sites obtained by investigating COVID–19 lockdowns\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C.

The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with Covid lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities, but increased in others.\n\nEvaluation of isoprene nitrate chemistry in detailed chemical mechanisms\n\nAlfred W.

This paper compares 3 different representations of the chemistry of isoprene nitrates in computational models highlighting cases where the choice of chemistry included has significant impacts on the concentration and composition of the modelled nitrates. Calibration of mass spectrometers is also shown to be an important factor when analysing isoprene nitrates.\n\nMeasurement report: Interpretation of wide-range particulate matter size distributions in Delhi\n\nÃlkÃ¼ Alver Åahin, Roy M.

The study found that anthropogenic and natural aerosols comprised 27 % and 73 % of the occurrence of the coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Our study shows that about two-thirds of the coarse-mode aerosols are related to two sea-spray-related aerosol clusters, indicating that sea spray aerosol may more complex in the Arctic environment.\n\nThe effect of meteorological conditions and atmospheric composition in the occurrence and development of new particle formation (NPF) events in Europe\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, James Brean, Francis D.

This study has carried out fundamental measurements of nucleation processes in Barcelona, Spain, and concludes that a mechanism involving stabilisation of sulfuric acid clusters by low molecular weight amines is primarily responsible for new particle formation events.\n\nObservations of highly oxidized molecules and particle nucleation in the atmosphere of Beijing\n\nJames Brean, Roy M. Harrison, Zongbo Shi, David C. S. Beddows, W. Joe F. Acton, C. Nicholas Hewitt, Freya A. Squires, and James Lee\n\nAtmos. Chem.

These molecules represent an intermediary between gas-phase chemicals from which they are formed and airborne particles which form from them. Conclusions are drawn as to the factors affecting the formation of new particles within the Beijing atmosphere.\n\nInterpretation of particle number size distributions measured across an urban area during the FASTER campaign\n\nRoy M. Harrison, David C. S. Beddows, Mohammed S. Alam, Ajit Singh, James Brean, Ruixin Xu, Simone Kotthaus, and Sue Grimmond\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Observations are interpreted in terms of both evaporative shrinkage of traffic-generated particles and condensational growth, probably of traffic-generated particles under cool nocturnal conditions, as well as the influence of particles emitted from Heathrow Airport at a distance of about 22 km. The work highlights the highly dynamic behaviour of nanoparticles within the urban atmosphere.\n\nExploring the variations in ambient BTEX in urban Europe and its environmental health implications\n\nXiansheng Liu, Xun Zhang, Marvin Dufresne, Tao Wang, Lijie Wu, Rosa Lara, Â Roger SecoÂ , Marta Monge, Ana Maria YÃ¡Ã±ez-Serrano, Marie Gohy, Paul Petit, Audrey Chevalier, Marie-Pierre Vagnot, Yann Fortier, Alexia Baudic, VÃ©ronique Ghersi, GrÃ©gory Gille, Ludovic Lanzi, ValÃ©rie Gros, LeÃ¯la Simon, Heidi Hellen, Stefan Reimann, ZoÃ© Le Bras, Michelle Jessy MÃ¼ller, David Beddows, Siqi Hou, Zongbo Shi, Roy M.

Analyzing data from 22 monitoring sites, we found traffic and industrial activities significantly impact BTEX levels, with peaks during rush hours. Despite improvements, the risk from BTEX exposure remains moderate, especially in high-traffic and industrial zones. It highlights the need for targeted air quality management to protect public health and improve urban air quality.\n\nAn interlaboratory comparison to quantify oxidative potential measurement in aerosol particles: challenges and recommendations for harmonisation\n\nPamela A.

In this study, we analyze ozone, ODEs, and their connection to meteorological and air mass history variables through statistical analyses, back-trajectories, and machine learning (ML) at Villum Research Station. ODEs are favorable under sunny, calm conditions with air masses arriving from northerly wind directions with sea ice contact.\n\nNew Particle Formation dynamics in the central Andes: Contrasting urban and mountain-top environments\n\nDiego Aliaga, Victoria A.

Days are clustered into four categories based on NPF intensity. Differences in particle size, precursor gases, and pollution levels are found. High NPF intensities increased Aitken mode particle concentrations at both sites, while volcanic influence selectively diminished NPF intensity at CHC but not EAC. This study highlights NPF dynamics in the Andes.\n\nSimultaneous organic aerosol source apportionment at two Antarctic sites reveals large-scale and ecoregion-specific components\n\nMarco Paglione, David C.

The roles of anthropogenic VOC sources in urban ozone chemistry are examined by integrating the 1990–2019 national atmospheric emission inventory into model scenarios. Road transport remains the most powerful means of further reducing ozone in this case study, but the benefits may be offset if solvent emissions of VOCs continue to increase.\n\nContribution of fluorescent primary biological aerosol particles to low-level Arctic cloud residuals\n\nGabriel Pereira Freitas, Ben Kopec, Kouji Adachi, Radovan Krejci, Dominic Heslin-Rees, Karl Espen Yttri, Alun Hubbard, Jeffrey M.

In the Arctic, where global warming manifests most, they may become more important as their sources prevail for longer periods of the year. We have directly measured bioaerosols within clouds for a full year at an Arctic mountain site using a novel combination of cloud particle sampling and single-particle techniques. We show that bioaerosols act as cloud seeds and may influence the presence of ice within clouds.\n\nMultiple eco-regions contribute to the seasonal cycle of Antarctic aerosol size distributions\n\nJames Brean, David C.

This study provides insight on the concentration level, variability, and optical properties of BC in the cities of La Paz and El Alto, and at the station GAW Chacaltaya Mountain station. Two methods of source apportionment of absorption were tested and compared showing traffic as the main contributor to absorption in the urban area, additionally to biomass and open waste burning.\n\nAerosol Size Distribution Properties Associated with Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Norwegian Arctic\n\nAbigail S.

We find higher sea spray number concentration, smaller Hoppel minima, lower effective supersaturations, and accumulation mode particle scavenging during cold-air outbreaks. These results advance our understanding of cold-air outbreak aerosol-cloud interactions in order to improve their accurate representation in models.\n\nThe behaviour of charged particles (ions) during new particle formation events in urban Leipzig (Germany)\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C.

Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM.\n\nTropical tropospheric aerosol sources and chemical composition observed at high altitude in the Bolivian Andes\n\nC.

Chacaltaya (5380 m a.s.l., Bolivian Andes). Minimum concentrations occur in the rainy season with maxima in the dry and transition seasons. The origins of the aerosol are located in a radius of hundreds of kilometers: nearby urban and rural areas, natural biogenic emissions, vegetation burning from Amazonia and Chaco, Pacific Ocean emissions, soil dust, and Peruvian volcanism.\n\nIncrease in precipitation scavenging contributes to long-term reductions of light-absorbing aerosol in the Arctic\n\nDominic Heslin-Rees, Peter Tunved, Johan StrÃ¶m, Roxana Cremer, Paul Zieger, Ilona Riipinen, Annica M.

We show that the amount of particle light absorption decreased from 2002 to 2023. We conclude that in addition to reductions in emissions of BC, wet removal plays a role in the long-term reduction of BC in the Arctic, given the increase in surface precipitation experienced by air masses arriving at the site. The potential impact of biomass burning events is shown to have increased.\n\nAERO-MAP: A data compilation and modelling approach to understand the fine and coarse mode aerosol composition\n\nNatalie M.

Major contributors to the simulated growth were low-volatility organic compounds (LVOCs). Also, sulfuric acid had major role when volcanic activity was occurring in the area. This study provides insight on nanoparticle growth at this high-altitude Southern Hemispheric site and hence contributes to building knowledge of early growth of atmospheric particles.\n\nInsights into the sources of ultrafine particle numbers at six European urban sites obtained by investigating COVID–19 lockdowns\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C.

The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with Covid lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities, but increased in others.\n\nSupercooled liquid water clouds observed over Dome C, Antarctica: temperature sensitivity and cloud radiative forcing\n\nPhilippe Ricaud, Massimo Del Guasta, Angelo Lupi, Romain Roehrig, Eric Bazile, Pierre Durand, Jean-Luc AttiÃ©, Alessia Nicosia, and Paolo Grigioni\n\nAtmos.

From observations at Concordia (Antarctica), we show that in supercooled liquid water (liquid water for temperatures below 0°C) clouds (SLWCs), temperature and SLWC radiative forcing increase with liquid water (up to 70 W m−2). We extrapolated that the maximum SLWC radiative forcing can reach 40 W m−2 over the Antarctic Peninsula, highlighting the importance of SLWCs for global climate prediction.\n\nDrivers controlling black carbon temporal variability in the lower troposphere of the European Arctic\n\nStefania Gilardoni, Dominic Heslin-Rees, Mauro Mazzola, Vito Vitale, Michael Sprenger, and Radovan Krejci\n\nAtmos.

Analysis of equivalent BC concentrations in the European Arctic shows that BC seasonal variability is modulated by the efficiency of removal by precipitation during transport towards high latitudes. Short-term variability is controlled by synoptic-scale circulation patterns. The advection of warm air from lower latitudes is an effective pollution transport pathway during summer.\n\nSpatial distribution and variability of boundary layer aerosol particles observed in Ny-Ã lesund during late spring in 2018\n\nBarbara Harm-AltstÃ¤dter, Konrad BÃ¤rfuss, Lutz Bretschneider, Martin SchÃ¶n, Jens Bange, Ralf KÃ¤thner, Radovan Krejci, Mauro Mazzola, Kihong Park, Falk PÃ¤tzold, Alexander Peuker, Rita Traversi, Birgit Wehner, and Astrid Lampert\n\nAerosol Research, 1, 39–64, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-1-39-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-1-39-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present observations of aerosol particles and meteorological parameters in the horizontal and vertical distribution measured with uncrewed aerial systems in the Arctic. The field campaign was carried out during the snow melting season, when ultrafine aerosol particles (UFPs) with a size between 3 and 12 nm occurred frequently. A high variability of the measured UFPs was identified in the spatial scale, which was strongly associated with different atmospheric boundary layer properties.\n\nAerosol and dynamical contributions to cloud droplet formation in Arctic low-level clouds\n\nGhislain Motos, Gabriel Freitas, Paraskevi Georgakaki, JÃ¶rg Wieder, Guangyu Li, Wenche Aas, Chris Lunder, Radovan Krejci, Julie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Pasquier, Jan Henneberger, Robert Oscar David, Christoph Ritter, Claudia Mohr, Paul Zieger, and Athanasios Nenes\n\nAtmos.

We gathered meteorological and aerosol physical and chemical data over a year and utilized them for a parameterization that help us unravel the factors driving and limiting the efficiency of cloud droplet formation. We then linked this information to the sources of aerosol found during each season and to processes of cloud glaciation.\n\nEnrichment of calcium in sea spray aerosol: insights from bulk measurements and individual particle analysis during the R/V Xuelong cruise in the summertime in Ross Sea, Antarctica\n\nBojiang Su, Xinhui Bi, Zhou Zhang, Yue Liang, Congbo Song, Tao Wang, Yaohao Hu, Lei Li, Zhen Zhou, Jinpei Yan, Xinming Wang, and Guohua Zhang\n\nAtmos.

The sources of particulate matter (PM) in this conurbation were not previously investigated. This study identified 11 main sources of PM, of which dust and vehicular emissions stand out as the main ones. The influence of regional biomass combustion and local waste combustion was also observed, with the latter being a major source of hazardous compounds.\n\nImpact of 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns on particulate air pollution across Europe\n\nJean-Philippe Putaud, Enrico Pisoni, Alexander Mangold, Christoph Hueglin, Jean Sciare, Michael Pikridas, Chrysanthos Savvides, Jakub Ondracek, Saliou Mbengue, Alfred Wiedensohler, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Laurent Poulain, Dominik van Pinxteren, Hartmut Herrmann, Andreas Massling, Claus Nordstroem, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Cristina Reche, NoemÃ­ PÃ©rez, Sonia Castillo, Mar Sorribas, Jose Antonio Adame, Tuukka Petaja, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Jarkko Niemi, VÃ©ronique Riffault, Joel F. de Brito, Augustin Colette, Olivier Favez, Jean-Eudes Petit, ValÃ©rie Gros, Maria I. Gini, Stergios Vratolis, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Evangelia Diapouli, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Karl Espen Yttri, and Wenche Aas\n\nAtmos. Chem.

COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 were used to assess the impact of the reduction in human mobility on air pollution across Europe by comparing measurement data with values that would be expected if no lockdown had occurred. We show that lockdown measures did not lead to consistent decreases in the concentrations of fine particulate matter suspended in the air, and we investigate why.\n\nComplex refractive index and single scattering albedo of Icelandic dust in the shortwave part of the spectrum\n\nClarissa Baldo, Paola Formenti, Claudia Di Biagio, Gongda Lu, Congbo Song, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Jean-Francois Doussin, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Olafur Arnalds, David Beddows, A. Robert MacKenzie, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7975–8000, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7975-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7975-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new shortwave spectral complex refractive index and single scattering albedo data for Icelandic dust. Our results show that the imaginary part of the complex refractive index of Icelandic dust is at the upper end of the range of low-latitude dust. Furthermore, we observed that Icelandic dust is more absorbing towards the near-infrared, which we attribute to its high magnetite content. These findings are important for modeling dust aerosol radiative effects in the Arctic.\n\nArctic observations of hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) â seasonal behavior and relationship to other oxidation products of dimethyl sulfide at the Zeppelin Observatory, Svalbard\n\nKarolina Siegel, Yvette Gramlich, Sophie L. Haslett, Gabriel Freitas, Radovan Krejci, Paul Zieger, and Claudia Mohr\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7569–7587, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7569-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7569-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) is a recently discovered oxidation product of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). We present a full year of concurrent gas- and particle-phase observations of HPMTF and other DMS oxidation products from the Arctic. We did not observe significant amounts of HPMTF in the particle phase but a good agreement between gas-phase HMPTF and methanesulfonic acid in the summer. Our study provides information about the relationship between HPMTF and other DMS oxidation products.\n\nVolatility of aerosol particles from NO3 oxidation of various biogenic organic precursors\n\nEmelie L. Graham, Cheng Wu, David M. Bell, Amelie Bertrand, Sophie L. Haslett, Urs Baltensperger, Imad El Haddad, Radovan Krejci, Ilona Riipinen, and Claudia Mohr\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7347–7362, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7347-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7347-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe volatility of an aerosol particle is an important parameter for describing its atmospheric lifetime. We studied the volatility of secondary organic aerosols from nitrate-initiated oxidation of three biogenic precursors with experimental methods and model simulations. We saw higher volatility than for the corresponding ozone system, and our simulations produced variable results with different parameterizations which warrant a re-evaluation of the treatment of the nitrate functional group.\n\nRevealing the chemical characteristics of Arctic low-level cloud residuals â in situ observations from a mountain site\n\nYvette Gramlich, Karolina Siegel, Sophie L. Haslett, Gabriel Freitas, Radovan Krejci, Paul Zieger, and Claudia Mohr\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6813–6834, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6813-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6813-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we investigate the chemical composition of aerosol particles forming clouds in the Arctic. During year-long observations at a mountain site on Svalbard, we find a large contribution of naturally derived aerosol particles in the fraction forming clouds in the summer. Our observations indicate that most aerosol particles can serve as cloud seeds in this remote environment.\n\nThe four-wavelength Photoacoustic Aerosol Absorption Spectrometer (PAAS-4Î»)\n\nFranz Martin Schnaiter, Claudia Linke, Eija Asmi, Henri Servomaa, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Sho Ohata, Yutaka Kondo, and Emma JÃ¤rvinen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 2753–2769, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2753-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2753-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLight-absorbing particles from combustion processes are important contributors to climate warming. Their highly variable spectral light absorption properties need to be monitored in the field. Commonly used methods show measurement artefacts that are difficult to correct. We introduce a new instrument that is based on the photoacoustic effect. Long-term operation in the Finnish Arctic demonstrates the applicability of the new instrument for unattended light absorption monitoring.\n\nModelling wintertime sea-spray aerosols under Arctic haze conditions\n\nEleftherios Ioannidis, Kathy S. Law, Jean-Christophe Raut, Louis Marelle, Tatsuo Onishi, Rachel M. Kirpes, Lucia M. Upchurch, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Andreas Massling, Henrik Skov, Patricia K. Quinn, and Kerri A. Pratt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5641–5678, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote and local anthropogenic emissions contribute to wintertime Arctic haze, with enhanced aerosol concentrations, but natural sources, which also contribute, are less well studied. Here, modelled wintertime sea-spray aerosols are improved in WRF-Chem over the wider Arctic by including updated wind speed and temperature-dependent treatments. As a result, anthropogenic nitrate aerosols are also improved. Open leads are confirmed to be the main source of sea-spray aerosols over northern Alaska.\n\nImpact of HO2 aerosol uptake on radical levels and O3 production during summertime in Beijing\n\nJoanna E.

In less polluted regions, atmospheric models over-predict HO2 concentrations. In this modelling study, the impact of heterogeneous uptake of HO2 onto aerosol surfaces on radical concentrations and the ozone production regime in Beijing in the summertime is investigated, and the implications for emissions policies across China are considered.\n\nMeasurement report: High Arctic aerosol hygroscopicity at sub- and supersaturated conditions during spring and summer\n\nAndreas Massling, Robert Lange, Jakob Boyd Pernov, Ulrich Gosewinkel, Lise-Lotte SÃ¸rensen, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4931–4953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4931-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4931-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of anthropogenic activities on cloud formation introduces the highest uncertainties with respect to climate change. Data on Arctic aerosols and their corresponding cloud-forming properties are very scarce and most important as the Arctic is warming about 2 times as fast as the rest of the globe. Our studies investigate aerosols in the remote Arctic and suggest relatively high cloud-forming potential, although differences are observed between the Arctic spring and summer.\n\nIce-nucleating particles in northern Greenland: annual cycles, biological contribution and parameterizations\n\nKevin C. H. Sze, Heike Wex, Markus Hartmann, Henrik Skov, Andreas Massling, Diego Villanueva, and Frank Stratmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4741–4761, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4741-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4741-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particles (INPs) play an important role in cloud formation and thus in our climate. But little is known about the abundance and properties of INPs, especially in the Arctic, where the temperature increases almost 4 times as fast as that of the rest of the globe. We observe higher INP concentrations and more biological INPs in summer than in winter, likely from local sources. We also provide three equations for estimating INP concentrations in models at different times of the year.\n\nMeasurement report: Molecular-level investigation of atmospheric cluster ions at the tropical high-altitude research station Chacaltaya (5240 m a.s.l.) in the Bolivian Andes\n\nQiaozhi Zha, Wei Huang, Diego Aliaga, Otso PerÃ¤kylÃ¤, Liine Heikkinen, Alkuin Maximilian Koenig, Cheng Wu, Joonas Enroth, Yvette Gramlich, Jing Cai, Samara Carbone, Armin Hansel, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, Douglas Worsnop, Victoria Sinclair, Radovan Krejci, Marcos Andrade, Claudia Mohr, and Federico Bianchi\n\nAtmos.

With state-of-the-art mass spectrometers and air mass history analysis, the measured cluster ions exhibited distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns, some of which contributed to new particle formation. Our study will improve the understanding of atmospheric ions and their role in high-altitude new particle formation.\n\nMeasurement report: Black carbon properties and concentrations in southern Sweden urban and rural air â the importance of long-range transport\n\nErik Ahlberg, Stina Ausmeel, Lovisa Nilsson, MÃ¥rten Spanne, Julija Pauraite, Jacob KlenÃ¸ NÃ¸jgaard, Michele BertÃ², Henrik Skov, Pontus Roldin, Adam Kristensson, Erik Swietlicki, and Axel Eriksson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3051–3064, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3051-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3051-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo investigate the properties and origin of black carbon particles in southern Sweden during late summer, we performed measurements both at a rural site and the nearby city of MalmÃ¶. We found that local traffic emissions of black carbon led to concentrations around twice as high as those at the rural site. Modeling show that these emissions are not clearly distinguishable at the rural site, unless meteorology was favourable, which shows the importance of long-range transport and processing.\n\nArctic tropospheric ozone: assessment of current knowledge and model performance\n\nCynthia H.

We find that the seasonal cycles of near-surface atmospheric ozone are variable depending on whether they are near the coast, inland, or at high altitude. Several global model simulations were evaluated, and we found that because models lack some of the ozone chemistry that is important for the coastal Arctic locations, they do not accurately simulate ozone there.\n\nA full year of aerosol size distribution data from the central Arctic under an extreme positive Arctic Oscillation: insights from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition\n\nMatthew Boyer, Diego Aliaga, Jakob Boyd Pernov, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Angot, Lauriane L.

We evaluate measurements of aerosol particles, which can influence climate, over the central Arctic Ocean for a full year and compare the data to land-based measurement stations across the Arctic. Our measurements show that the central Arctic has similarities to but also distinct differences from the stations further south. We note that this may change as the Arctic warms and sea ice continues to decline.\n\nHow horizontal transport and turbulent mixing impacts aerosol particle and precursor concentrations at a background site in the UAE\n\nJutta Kesti, Ewan James O'Connor, Anne Hirsikko, John Backman, Heikki Lihavainen, Hannele Korhonen, and Eija Asmi\n\nAtmos.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-811,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-811, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ACP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study combines aerosol particle measurements at the surface and vertical profiling of the atmosphere with a scanning Doppler lidar to investigate how transport together with boundary layer evolution can affect particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface in the Arabian Peninsula region. The instrumentation enabled us to see elevated nucleation mode particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface when air masses transported from polluted areas are mixed in the boundary layer.\n\nEvaluation of isoprene nitrate chemistry in detailed chemical mechanisms\n\nAlfred W.

This paper compares 3 different representations of the chemistry of isoprene nitrates in computational models highlighting cases where the choice of chemistry included has significant impacts on the concentration and composition of the modelled nitrates. Calibration of mass spectrometers is also shown to be an important factor when analysing isoprene nitrates.\n\nComposition and mixing state of Arctic aerosol and cloud residual particles from long-term single-particle observations at Zeppelin Observatory, Svalbard\n\nKouji Adachi, Yutaka Tobo, Makoto Koike, Gabriel Freitas, Paul Zieger, and Radovan Krejci\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14421–14439, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14421-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14421-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient aerosol and cloud residual particles in the fine mode were collected at Zeppelin Observatory in Svalbard and were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Fractions of mineral dust and sea salt particles increased in cloud residual samples collected at ambient temperatures below 0 Â°C. This study highlights the variety of aerosol and cloud residual particle compositions and mixing states that influence or are influenced by aerosol–cloud interactions in Arctic low-level clouds.\n\nEffects of temperature and salinity on bubble-bursting aerosol formation simulated with a bubble-generating chamber\n\nSvetlana Sofieva, Eija Asmi, Nina S.

Our main findings suggest modest dependence of aerosol production on the water salinity and a strong dependence on temperature below ~ 10 Â°C.\n\nHygroscopicity and CCN potential of DMS-derived aerosol particles\n\nBernadette Rosati, Sini IsokÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤, Sigurd Christiansen, Mads MÃ¸rk Jensen, Shamjad P. Moosakutty, Robin Wollesen de Jonge, Andreas Massling, Marianne Glasius, Jonas Elm, Annele Virtanen, and Merete Bilde\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Due to the reduction in sulfur-based fossil fuels, natural sulfur emissions play an increasingly important role. Studies investigating the climate relevance of natural sulfur aerosols are scarce. We study the water uptake of such particles in the laboratory, demonstrating a high potential to take up water and form cloud droplets. During atmospheric transit, chemical processing affects the particlesâ composition and thus their water uptake.\n\nComparison of particle number size distribution trends in ground measurements and climate models\n\nVille Leinonen, Harri Kokkola, Taina Yli-Juuti, Tero Mielonen, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Tuomo Nieminen, Simo Heikkinen, Tuuli Miinalainen, Tommi Bergman, Ken Carslaw, Stefano Decesari, Markus Fiebig, Tareq Hussein, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Radovan Krejci, Markku Kulmala, Ari Leskinen, Andreas Massling, Nikos Mihalopoulos, Jane P.

We investigated aerosol modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation) separately and were able to show the differences between measured and modeled trends and especially their seasonal patterns. The differences in model results are likely due to complex effects of several processes instead of certain specific model features.\n\nSecondary aerosol formation in marine Arctic environments: a model measurement comparison at Ny-Ã lesund\n\nCarlton Xavier, Metin Baykara, Robin Wollesen de Jonge, Barbara AltstÃ¤dter, Petri Clusius, Ville Vakkari, Roseline Thakur, Lisa Beck, Silvia Becagli, Mirko Severi, Rita Traversi, Radovan Krejci, Peter Tunved, Mauro Mazzola, Birgit Wehner, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, Michael Boy, and Pontus Roldin\n\nAtmos.

We run the 1D model ADCHEM along air mass trajectories arriving at Ny-Ã lesund in May 2018. The model finds that ion-mediated H2SO4–NH3 nucleation can explain the observed new particle formation at Ny-Ã lesund. The growth of particles is driven via H2SO4 condensation and formation of methane sulfonic acid in the aqueous phase.\n\nA study on the performance of low-cost sensors for source apportionment at an urban background site\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, David C.

This paper extends the ability of low-cost sensors to not only measure air pollution, but also to understand where the pollution comes from. This \"source apportionment\" is a critical step in air quality management to allow for the mitigation of air pollution. The techniques developed in this paper have the potential for great impact in both research and industrial applications.\n\nInvestigation of new particle formation mechanisms and aerosol processes at Marambio Station, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nLauriane L.

This work provides extensive analysis of aerosol particles and their precursors at Marambio Station, Antarctic Peninsula. We show that sulfuric acid, ammonia, and dimethylamine are key contributors to the frequent new particle formation events observed at the site. We discuss nucleation mechanisms and highlight the need for targeted measurement to fully understand these processes.\n\nModel evaluation of short-lived climate forcers for the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme: a multi-species, multi-model study\n\nCynthia H.

Atmospheric models are often used to provide information to policy makers about current and future conditions under different emissions scenarios. In order to have confidence in those simulations, in this study we compare simulated air pollution from 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric models to measured air pollution in order to assess how well the models perform.\n\nMeasurement report: Interpretation of wide-range particulate matter size distributions in Delhi\n\nÃlkÃ¼ Alver Åahin, Roy M.

New particle formation occurred frequently during the pre-monsoon (spring) season and it significantly modulates the shape of the particle number size distributions. The contribution of newly formed particles to cloud condensation nuclei concentrations was ~3 times higher in urban locations than in mountain background locations.\n\nOverview: Recent advances in the understanding of the northern Eurasian environments and of the urban air quality in China â a Pan-Eurasian Experiment (PEEX) programme perspective\n\nHanna K.

Although the scientific knowledge in these regions has increased, there are still gaps in our understanding of large-scale climate–Earth surface interactions and feedbacks. This arises from limitations in research infrastructures and integrative data analyses, hindering a comprehensive system analysis.\n\nOdds and ends of atmospheric mercury in Europe and over the North Atlantic Ocean: temporal trends of 25 years of measurements\n\nDanilo CustÃ³dio, Katrine Aspmo Pfaffhuber, T.

We present long-term time series of up to 30 years of atmospheric components and atmospheric transport phenomena. Many of these time series are important to our understanding of Arctic and global atmospheric composition change. Finally, we discuss the future of the Zeppelin Observatory and emerging areas of future research on the Arctic atmosphere.\n\nPan-Arctic seasonal cycles and long-term trends of aerosol properties from 10 observatories\n\nJulia Schmale, Sangeeta Sharma, Stefano Decesari, Jakob Pernov, Andreas Massling, Hans-Christen Hansson, Knut von Salzen, Henrik Skov, Elisabeth Andrews, Patricia K. Quinn, Lucia M. Upchurch, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Rita Traversi, Stefania Gilardoni, Mauro Mazzola, James Laing, and Philip Hopke\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The number of significant trends in summer is smaller than in winter, and overall the pattern is ambiguous with some significant positive and negative trends. This reflects the mixed influence of natural and anthropogenic emissions.\n\nPM2.5 Source Apportionment using Organic Marker-based CMB Modeling: Influence of Inorganic Markers and Sensitivity to Source Profiles\n\nYingze Tian, Xiaoning Wang, Peng Zhao, Zongbo Shi, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-1007,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-1007, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical mass balance (CMB) is a widely used method to apportion the sources of PM2.5. We explore the sensitivity of CMB results to input data of organic markers only (OM-CMB) with a combination of organic and inorganic markers (IOM-CMB), as well as using different chemical profiles for sources. Our results indicate the superiority of combining inorganic and organic tracers and using locally-relevant source profiles in source apportionment of PM.\n\nAerosol particle characteristics measured in the United Arab Emirates and their response to mixing in the boundary layer\n\nJutta Kesti, John Backman, Ewan J. O'Connor, Anne Hirsikko, Eija Asmi, Minna Aurela, Ulla Makkonen, Maria Filioglou, Mika Komppula, Hannele Korhonen, and Heikki Lihavainen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The instrumentation used in this study enabled us to identify periods when pollution from remote sources was mixed down to the surface and initiated new particle formation in the growing boundary layer.\n\nIdentifying source regions of air masses sampled at the tropical high-altitude site of Chacaltaya using WRF-FLEXPART and cluster analysis\n\nDiego Aliaga, Victoria A. Sinclair, Marcos Andrade, Paulo Artaxo, Samara Carbone, Evgeny Kadantsev, Paolo Laj, Alfred Wiedensohler, Radovan Krejci, and Federico Bianchi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16453–16477, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16453-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16453-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the origin of air masses sampled at Mount Chacaltaya, Bolivia. Three-quarters of the measured air has not been influenced by the surface in the previous 4 d. However, it is rare that, at any given time, the sampled air has not been influenced at all by the surface, and often the sampled air has multiple origins. The influence of the surface is more prevalent during day than night. Furthermore, during the 6-month study, one-third of the air masses originated from Amazonia.\n\nEstimates of mass absorption cross sections of black carbon for filter-based absorption photometers in the Arctic\n\nSho Ohata, Tatsuhiro Mori, Yutaka Kondo, Sangeeta Sharma, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, Elisabeth Andrews, Peter Tunved, Eija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Daniel Veber, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Stergios Vratolis, Radovan Krejci, Paul Zieger, Makoto Koike, Yugo Kanaya, Atsushi Yoshida, Nobuhiro Moteki, Yongjing Zhao, Yutaka Tobo, Junji Matsushita, and Naga Oshima\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6723–6748, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6723-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6723-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReliable values of mass absorption cross sections (MACs) of black carbon (BC) are required to determine mass concentrations of BC at Arctic sites using different types of filter-based absorption photometers. We successfully estimated MAC values for these instruments through comparison with independent measurements of BC by a continuous soot monitoring system called COSMOS. These MAC values are consistent with each other and applicable to study spatial and temporal variation in BC in the Arctic.\n\nInsight into PM2.5 sources by applying positive matrix factorization (PMF) at urban and rural sites of Beijing\n\nDeepchandra Srivastava, Jingsha Xu, Tuan V. Vu, Di Liu, Linjie Li, Pingqing Fu, Siqi Hou, Natalia Moreno Palmerola, Zongbo Shi, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14703–14724, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14703-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14703-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the source apportionment of PM2.5 performed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) at urban and rural sites in Beijing. These factors are interpreted as traffic emissions, biomass burning, road and soil dust, coal and oil combustion, and secondary inorganics. PMF failed to resolve some sources identified by CMB and AMS and appears to overestimate the dust sources. Comparison with earlier PMF studies from the Beijing area highlights inconsistent findings using this method.\n\nIn situ ozone production is highly sensitive to volatile organic compounds in Delhi, India\n\nBeth S.

The change in ozone production by varying atmospheric pollutants according to their sources, as defined in an emissions inventory, is investigated. The study suggests that reducing road transport emissions alone does not reduce reactive VOCs in the atmosphere enough to perturb an increase in ozone production.\n\nDynamics of gaseous oxidized mercury at Villum Research Station during the High Arctic summer\n\nJakob Boyd Pernov, Bjarne Jensen, Andreas Massling, Daniel Charles Thomas, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13287–13309, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13287-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13287-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric mercury species (GEM, GOM, PHg) are important constituents in the High Arctic due to their detrimental effects on human and ecosystem health. However, understanding their behavior in the High Arctic summer remains lacking. This research investigates the dynamics of mercury oxidation in the High Arctic summer. The cold, dry, sunlit free troposphere was associated with events of high GOM in the High Arctic summer, while individual events yielded unique origins.\n\nZeppelin-led study on the onset of new particle formation in the planetary boundary layer\n\nJanne Lampilahti, Hanna E.

New particle formation events arising from nucleation of gaseous precursors have been analysed in extensive datasets from 13 sites in five European countries in terms of frequency, nucleation rate, and particle growth rate, with several common features and many differences identified. Although nucleation frequencies are lower at roadside sites, nucleation rates and particle growth rates are typically higher.\n\nAbsorption instruments inter-comparison campaign at the Arctic Pallas station\n\nEija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Aki Virkkula, Maria I. Gini, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Sho Ohata, Yutaka Kondo, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Meas.

We applied eight different absorbing-aerosol measurement methods in a field campaign at the Arctic Pallas station. The filter-based techniques were found to be the most sensitive to detect the minuscule amounts of black carbon present, showing a 40 % agreement between them. Our results help to reduce uncertainties in absorbing aerosol measurements.\n\nDifferentiation of coarse-mode anthropogenic, marine and dust particles in the High Arctic islands of Svalbard\n\nCongbo Song, Manuel Dall'Osto, Angelo Lupi, Mauro Mazzola, Rita Traversi, Silvia Becagli, Stefania Gilardoni, Stergios Vratolis, Karl Espen Yttri, David C.

The study found that anthropogenic and natural aerosols comprised 27 % and 73 % of the occurrence of the coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Our study shows that about two-thirds of the coarse-mode aerosols are related to two sea-spray-related aerosol clusters, indicating that sea spray aerosol may more complex in the Arctic environment.\n\nMediterranean nascent sea spray organic aerosol and relationships with seawater biogeochemistry\n\nEvelyn Freney, Karine Sellegri, Alessia Nicosia, Leah R.

As oxidation products of DMS have important roles in new particle formation and growth, we focused on factors affecting their variability and the branching ratio of DMS oxidation. We found a strong correlation between the ratio and the light condition, chemical properties of particles, and biological activities near Svalbard.\n\nA long-term study of cloud residuals from low-level Arctic clouds\n\nLinn Karlsson, Radovan Krejci, Makoto Koike, Kerstin Ebell, and Paul Zieger\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We present the first direct, long-term measurements of cloud residuals, i.e. the particles that remain when cloud droplets and ice crystals are dried. These detailed observations of cloud residuals cover more than 2 years, which is unique for the Arctic and globally. This work studies the size distributions of cloud residuals, their seasonality, and dependence on meteorology.\n\nAssessing the sources of particles at an urban background site using both regulatory instruments and low-cost sensors â a comparative study\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, Ajit Singh, Molly Haugen, David C.

The source apportionment results were compared with those by chemical mass balance and AMS/ACSM-PMF methods. Correlations of WINSOC and WSOC with different sources of OC were also performed to elucidate the formation mechanisms of SOC.\n\nSource apportionment of fine organic carbon at an urban site of Beijing using a chemical mass balance model\n\nJingsha Xu, Di Liu, Xuefang Wu, Tuan V.

Seven primary sources (industrial/residential coal burning, biomass burning, gasoline/diesel vehicles, cooking and vegetative detritus) explained an average of 75.7 % and 56.1 % of fine OC in winter and summer, respectively. CMB was found to resolve more primary OA sources than AMS-PMF, but the latter apportioned more secondary OA sources.\n\nAtmospheric conditions and composition that influence PM2.5 oxidative potential in Beijing, China\n\nSteven J.

Phys., 21, 5173–5193, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5173-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5173-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn a radiological emergency preparedness system, Lagrangian particle dispersion models are often used to track the dispersion of radioactive material. In this study we have shown the importance of simulating advanced aerosol dynamic processes that are commonly neglected or simplified in these simulations. We show that inclusion of detailed ambient-aerosol dynamics can play a large role in the model result in simulations adopting a more detailed representation of aerosol–cloud interactions.\n\nShift in seasonal snowpack melt-out date due to light-absorbing particles at a high-altitude site in Central Himalaya\n\nJohan StrÃ¶m, Jonas Svensson, Henri Honkanen, Eija Asmi, Nathaniel B. Dkhar, Shresth Tayal, Ved P. Sharma, Rakesh Hooda, Outi Meinander, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, Hans-Werner Jacobi, Heikki Lihavainen, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-158,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-158, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow darkening in the Himalaya results from the deposition of different particles. Here we assess the change in the seasonal snow cover duration due to the presence of mineral dust and black carbon particles in the snow of Sunderdhunga valley, Central Himalaya, India. With the use of in situ weather station data, the snow melt-out date is estimated to be shifted ~13 days earlier due to the presence of the particles in the snow.\n\nLate-spring and summertime tropospheric ozone and NO2 in western Siberia and the Russian Arctic: regional model evaluation and sensitivities\n\nThomas Thorp, Stephen R. Arnold, Richard J. Pope, Dominick V. Spracklen, Luke Conibear, Christoph Knote, Mikhail Arshinov, Boris Belan, Eija Asmi, Tuomas Laurila, Andrei I. Skorokhod, Tuomo Nieminen, and Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 4677–4697, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4677-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4677-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare modelled near-surface pollutants with surface and satellite observations to better understand the controls on the regional concentrations of pollution in western Siberia for late spring and summer in 2011. We find two commonly used emission inventories underestimate human emissions when compared to observations. Transport emissions are the main source of pollutants within the region during this period, whilst fire emissions peak during June and are only significant south of 60° N.\n\nThe effect of meteorological conditions and atmospheric composition in the occurrence and development of new particle formation (NPF) events in Europe\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, James Brean, Francis D. Pope, Manuel Dall'Osto, Xavier Querol, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Noemi Perez, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Andreas Massling, Jacob KlenÃ¸ NÃ¸jgaard, Claus NordstrÃ¸m, Giorgos Kouvarakis, Stergios Vratolis, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Jarkko V. Niemi, Harri Portin, Alfred Wiedensohler, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Thomas Tuch, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3345–3370, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3345-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3345-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew particle formation events from 16 sites over Europe have been studied, and the influence of meteorological and atmospheric composition variables has been investigated. Some variables, like solar radiation intensity and temperature, have a positive effect on the occurrence of these events, while others have a negative effect, affecting different aspects such as the rate at which particles are formed or grow. This effect varies depending on the site type and magnitude of these variables.\n\nElemental and water-insoluble organic carbon in Svalbard snow: a synthesis of observations during 2007â2018\n\nChristian Zdanowicz, Jean-Charles Gallet, Mats P. BjÃ¶rkman, Catherine Larose, Thomas Schuler, BartÅomiej Luks, Krystyna Koziol, Andrea Spolaor, Elena Barbaro, TÃµnu Martma, Ward van Pelt, Ulla Wideqvist, and Johan StrÃ¶m\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3035–3057, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3035-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3035-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBlack carbon (BC) aerosols are soot-like particles which, when transported to the Arctic, darken snow surfaces, thus indirectly affecting climate. Information on BC in Arctic snow is needed to measure their impact and monitor the efficacy of pollution-reduction policies. This paper presents a large new set of BC measurements in snow in Svalbard collected between 2007 and 2018. It describes how BC in snow varies across the archipelago and explores some factors controlling these variations.\n\nDeposition of light-absorbing particles in glacier snow of the Sunderdhunga Valley, the southern forefront of the central Himalayas\n\nJonas Svensson, Johan StrÃ¶m, Henri Honkanen, Eija Asmi, Nathaniel B. Dkhar, Shresth Tayal, Ved P. Sharma, Rakesh Hooda, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, Hans-Werner Jacobi, Heikki Lihavainen, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 2931–2943, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2931-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2931-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLight-absorbing particles specifically affect snowmelt in the Himalayas. Through measurements of the constituents in glacier snow pits from the Indian Himalayas our investigations show that different snow layers display striking similarities. These similarities can be characterized by a deposition constant. Our results further indicate that mineral dust can be responsible for the majority of light absorption in the snow in this part of the Himalayas.\n\nAtmospheric VOC measurements at a High Arctic site: characteristics and source apportionment\n\nJakob B. Pernov, Rossana Bossi, Thibaut Lebourgeois, Jacob K. NÃ¸jgaard, Rupert Holzinger, Jens L. Hjorth, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 2895–2916, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2895-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2895-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an important constituent in the Arctic atmosphere due to their effect on aerosol and ozone formation. However, an understanding of their sources is lacking. This research presents a multiseason high-time-resolution dataset of VOCs in the Arctic and details their temporal characteristics and source apportionment. Four sources were identified: biomass burning, marine cryosphere, background, and Arctic haze.\n\nPan-Arctic surface ozone: modelling vs. measurements\n\nXin Yang, Anne-M. Blechschmidt, Kristof Bognar, Audra McClure-Begley, Sara Morris, Irina Petropavlovskikh, Andreas Richter, Henrik Skov, Kimberly Strong, David W. Tarasick, Taneil Uttal, Mika Vestenius, and Xiaoyi Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15937–15967, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15937-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15937-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis is a modelling-based study on Arctic surface ozone, with a particular focus on spring ozone depletion events (i.e. with concentrations < 10 ppbv). Model experiments show that model runs with blowing-snow-sourced sea salt aerosols implemented as a source of reactive bromine can reproduce well large-scale ozone depletion events observed in the Arctic. This study supplies modelling evidence of the proposed mechanism of reactive-bromine release from blowing snow on sea ice (Yang et al., 2008).\n\nEstimates of mass absorption cross sections of black carbon for filter-based absorption photometers in the Arctic\n\nSho Ohata, Tatsuhiro Mori, Yutaka Kondo, Sangeeta Sharma, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, Elisabeth Andrews, Peter Tunved, Eija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Daniel Veber, Makoto Koike, Yugo Kanaya, Atsushi Yoshida, Nobuhiro Moteki, Yongjing Zhao, Junji Matsushita, and Naga Oshima\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-1190,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-1190, 2020\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReliable values of mass absorption cross sections (MAC) of black carbon (BC) are required to determine mass concentrations of BC at Arctic sites using different types of filter-based absorption photometers. We successfully estimated MAC values for these instruments through comparison with independent measurements of BC by continuous soot monitoring system called COSMOS. These MAC values are consistent with each other and applicable to study spatial and temporal variation of BC in the Arctic.\n\nAn interlaboratory comparison of aerosol inorganic ion measurements by ion chromatography: implications for aerosol pH estimate\n\nJingsha Xu, Shaojie Song, Roy M. Harrison, Congbo Song, Lianfang Wei, Qiang Zhang, Yele Sun, Lu Lei, Chao Zhang, Xiaohong Yao, Dihui Chen, Weijun Li, Miaomiao Wu, Hezhong Tian, Lining Luo, Shengrui Tong, Weiran Li, Junling Wang, Guoliang Shi, Yanqi Huangfu, Yingze Tian, Baozhu Ge, Shaoli Su, Chao Peng, Yang Chen, Fumo Yang, Aleksandra Mihajlidi-ZeliÄ, Dragana ÄorÄeviÄ, Stefan J.

Daellenbach, Chao Yan, Yongchun Liu, Markku Kulmala, Pingqing Fu, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 6325–6341, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6325-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6325-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn interlaboratory comparison was conducted for the first time to examine differences in water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) measured by 10 labs using ion chromatography (IC) and by two online aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) methods. Major ions including SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ agreed well in 10 IC labs and correlated well with ACSM data. WSII interlab variability strongly affected aerosol acidity results based on ion balance, but aerosol pH computed by ISORROPIA II was very similar.\n\nA comparison of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in summer Beijing (China) and Delhi (India)\n\nAtallah Elzein, Gareth J. Stewart, Stefan J. Swift, Beth S. Nelson, Leigh R. Crilley, Mohammed S. Alam, Ernesto Reyes-Villegas, Ranu Gadi, Roy M. Harrison, Jacqueline F. Hamilton, and Alastair C. Lewis\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 14303–14319, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14303-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14303-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe collected high-frequency air particle samples (PM2.5) in Beijing (China) and Delhi (India) and measured the concentration of PAHs in daytime and night-time. PAHs were higher in Delhi than in Beijing, and the five-ring PAHs contribute the most to the total PAH concentration. We compared the emission sources and identified the major sectors that could be subject to mitigation measures. The adverse health effects from inhalation exposure to PAHs in Delhi are 2.2 times higher than in Beijing.\n\nFrom a polar to a marine environment: has the changing Arctic led to a shift in aerosol light scattering properties?\n\nDominic Heslin-Rees, Maria Burgos, Hans-Christen Hansson, Radovan Krejci, Johan StrÃ¶m, Peter Tunved, and Paul Zieger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 13671–13686, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13671-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13671-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol particles are one important key player in the Arctic climate. Using long-term measurements of particle light scattering from an observatory on Svalbard, this study investigates the reasons behind an observed shift towards larger particles seen in the last 2 decades. We find that increases in sea spray are the most likely cause. Air masses from the south-west have increased significantly, suggestive of a potential mechanism, whilst the retreat in sea ice has a marginal influence.\n\nAtmospheric new particle formation characteristics in the Arctic as measured at Mount Zeppelin, Svalbard, from 2016 to 2018\n\nHaebum Lee, Kwangyul Lee, Chris Rene Lunder, Radovan Krejci, Wenche Aas, Jiyeon Park, Ki-Tae Park, Bang Yong Lee, Young Jun Yoo"
