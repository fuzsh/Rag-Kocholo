        "text": "Three friends, two teenage boys and a teenage girl, are drug addicts caught up in the Stockholms drug world...One dies of a heroin overdose, while the teenage girl becomes a prostitute and is almost killed by a \"socially upright\" customer.\n\nThis farce cocerns Sweden's King Gustav (Per Oscarsson who plays all the lead roles). The royal monarchs of three major European countries are patiently or not-so-patiently hovering on the sidelines while watching the future King Gustav closely. No single king appears to possess the brains he was born with, so history seems to be made by default, as it were. Gustav does blunder around, but not enough to miss being crowned king. As a result, France, England, and Germany invade Sweden hoping to take by force what they could not gain by incompetence.\n\n1944. Cederqvist comes to a small cloth factory to see how the all-women staff can work more efficiently. When first arriving he is greeted with suspicion and his efforts at courting the young ladies are futile. But as soon as he buys himself a car it becomes much easier, especially since he is authorized to relocate people to an easier line of work.\n\nTo get an order for 1,000 yachts from a middle-east sheik, two boat companies have to race 'Göta kanal', a canal through Sweden, east to west. There are no rules in this game and the winner gets the order.\n\nSickan has a new plan. This time, the gang will steal a small computer microchip that contains a top-secret plan of what the government intends to do with Sweden in the future. But Wall-Enberg is also planning to steal the chip. The payment will be 55 million Swedish crowns in gold and diamonds to whoever can deliver the chip to the foreign investors. Who will grab hold of the chip, the Jönsson gang or Wall-Enberg?\n\nSickan, Vanheden and Rocky try to rob the Berns nightclub one night, but Vanheden has made the mistake to invite his constantly drunk cousin, the old dynamiter Dynamite-Harry and he ruins the plan. Sickan is arrested, and has to spend 10 months in a small, locked room. When he is released, he has a new plan, but Rocky and Vanheden have decided to go straight. Together with Dynamite-Harry, Sickan plans to rob a cold store, managed by their arch-enemy, Wall-Enberg.\n\nPettersson and Bendel are both worn, run-down and broke. Despite this they decide to start a business and become rich. Unexperienced they are open to any deal. They tamper, scam and exploit loopholes that exist.\n\nIn Stockholm, on St. Lucy's feast day, a bandit daringly robs a crowded post office. Within a fortnight, two witnesses are dead. Two cops from vice squad, Johansson and Jarnebring, who were the first to the crime scene, pursue all leads and identify a suspect, an arrogant member of the elite secret police, a man assigned to guard the country's Minister of Justice. Just as the beat cops think they've tightened the noose around the suspect, loose ends appear, witnesses lose their certainty, alibis crop up, and even the cops doubt what they've seen. Who's protecting the suspect and why?\n\nJohn and Carl have a small publishing company. One day John meets the poet Clara who recently made her debut, and Clara's fiancé Stig. John and Clara fall in love with each other, and she moves into an apartment owned by John. John breaks up with his wife and moves in with Clara. But Clara has a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe young nobleman Inge is riding through Sweden, looking for his twin brother, Arild. He meets a group of gypsies who welcome him. They met Arild earlier and believe that the brother is Arild. Inge falls in love with the mysterious girl Isis.\n\nA chemistry teacher is framed for making drugs. In prison he discovers a passage out. A gang forces him to reveal it and join them in their crimes outside, returning each time. He meets a cutie that turns out to be a cop.\n\nA Stockholm cop moves back home to his brother near Norway and Finland. He investigates out of control reindeer poaching. He confiscates rifles with no permits. Everybody, even his brother and local cops, are against him. Things escalate.\n\nFrank, Sara and their two children have recently moved into the house of their dreams on the countryside. Frank is disturbed by mysterious sounds and somebody tears down the wallpaper from the walls. He contacts a ghost-hunter, Allan. While conducting an experiment, Allan is killed, and Frank has to find out the truth himself. What's so special with the mysterious room in the attic?"
