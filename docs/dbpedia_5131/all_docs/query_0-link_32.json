        "text": "In the morning the course was inspected by autogiro. The plan was that the standard cars were to start 11:10 and the race cars 20 minutes later at 11:30. In that way the race cars would start before the standard cars had finished their first lap and the race cars would have the course free in front of them.\n\nThe standard cars started at the correct time and raced through the curves on the ice in a cloud of snow towards the viaduct with Anders Olsson leading followed by C-G Johansson, Castenshiold, Wallenius, Gunnar Olsson, Thure Johansson and Pahl. To the surprise of the spectators Westerberg and Strömberg decided to make the compulsory 3 minute stop immediately, hoping to have a free course after that, so they pitted and thus avoided the multiple crash near the viaduct involving some ten cars. The incident started when Norwegian Grönneberg, trying to close a not properly locked car door, got the door fully open by mistake and the car spun in the middle of the field. Seven cars had to retire including the whole Adler team as the three Adler cars one after the other crashed into the heap of spun or tipped over cars.\n\nBoström, Svedberg, the Norwegians Grönneberg and Helling and all three Germans had to retire. Luckily there were no serious injuries. Von Guilleaume got a bleeding nose, Grönneberg a cut on an ear and Sauerwein a light concussion.\n\nIt took time to sort up the mess. The worried spectators knew no details about the crash, just that the start of the race class had to be delayed.\n\nAndes Olsson made the first lap in 31m30s followed by C-G Johansson, Wallenius, Thure Johansson, Eck and Servais. Right then the race cars were flagged off in the middle of the standard car field, just what the organizers had hoped to avoid. Luckily the standard cars did their best to give room for the race cars throughout the race.\n\nBjørnstad took the lead at the start and made the first lap in 26m23s followed by Ebb 28m09s. Ebb had early realized he had no chance to keep up with the Monza with twin rear wheels and settled for second position. Hartmann, who had forgot to bring with him a type of patented chains he had planned to test, stopped at the pit after the first lap and retired his Maserati.\n\nThe race order after the first lap:\n\n1.Bjørnstad (Alfa Romeo) 2.Ebb (Mercedes-Benz) 3.Lindh (Bugatti) 4.Elo (Bugatti) 5.Sundstedt (Bugatti) 6.Jonsson (Bugatti) 7.Berg (Mercedes-Benz) 8.Westerblom (Amilcar) 9.Rolander (Amilcar) 10.Hartmann (Maseratii) 11.Stolz (Bugatti)\n\nHerbert Berg was in trouble with the battery. After the second lap Bjørnstad with a medium speed of 105 km/h held a 2 ½ minute lead over Ebb. Race situation after lap 2:\n\n1.Bjørnstad (Alfa Romeo) 2.Ebb (Mercedes-Benz) 3.Elo (Bugatti) 4.Jonsson (Bugatti) 5.Lindh (Bugatti) 6.Sundstedt (Bugatti) 7.Westerblom (Amilcar) 8.Rolander (Amilcar) 9.Berg (Mercedes-Benz) 10.Stolz (Bugatti)\n\nAt the Sellnäs viaduct on the third lap Westerblom had to swerve hard for another competitor. The Amilcar went on two wheels, made a forwards somersault and landed upside down in the snow outside the course. No one thought the driver had survived but as the clerks rushed to the place of the accident they could hear Westerblom shouting that they should turn the car right. He had ducked into the cockpit and held on to the gear level and thus survived uninjured from the crash and was able to return to the race as soon as the Amilcar was turned over the correct way. After the event Westerblom was nicknamed \"Spak-Adolf\" (Level-Adolf).\n\nDuring the lap Jonsson passed Elo for third position. The Order after lap 3 looked like this:\n\n1.Bjørnstad (Alfa Romeo) 2.Ebb (Mercedes-Benz) 3.Jonsson (Bugatti) 4.Elo (Bugatti) 5.Lindh (Bugatti) 6.Sundstedt (Bugatti) 7.Berg (Mercedes-Benz) 8.Rolander (Amilcar) 9.Westerblom (Amilcar) 10.Stolz (Bugatti)\n\nIn the standard class Sven Servais crashed his Ford into a ditch and retired. Westerblom had to retire due to a damaged axle, probably a consequence of the crash on the previous lap. After four laps Bjørnstad was leading Ebb by 4m32s. Berg's electrical troubles went worse and worse and eventually he retired as hardly any plugs were working any longer. Apart from that the race order remained the same from the 4th to the 7th lap.\n\nThe race order for laps 4 to 7 thus stayed like this:\n\n1.1. Bjørnstad (Alfa Romeo) 2.Ebb (Mercedes-Benz) 3.Jonsson (Bugatti) 4.Elo (Bugatti) 5.Lindh (Bugatti) 6.Sundstedt (Bugatti) 7.Rolander (Amilcar) 8.Berg (Mercedes-Benz)retired after 4 laps\n\nBjørnstad started the last lap with an over 4 minute lead and considered making a stop for fuel but in the end he decided to continue.\n\nOn the last lap Elo suffered from a broken carburettor seal and he had to make a three kilometre walk to the pit and back for tools and spares, dropping from 4th to 7th position. Stoltz either retired his Bugatti or, as one source says, was pulled off the event for being too slow.\n\nAfter 3 hours 36 minutes Bjørnstad took the chequered flag to win the race almost six minutes in front of Ebb. Bjørnstad had only 1 1/2 litre fuel left in the tank. Ebb's studs were worn out but he had decided it was no use to stop and then destroy a new costly set of stud tyres even if had made him a bit faster. Jonsson with his Bugatti was the best Swedish driver in third position. Lindh just made it past the finish line in fourth position, a few hundred meters afterwards his Bugatti run out of fuel. Sundstedt was fifth followed by Rolander in his little Amilcar and Elo.\n\nAnders Olsson won the standard car class leading from start to finish. He had only seen second positioned C-G Johansson during the 3 minute pit stop. The latter first tried to keep up with Olsson's speed and held eye contact for a while but then realized he would never be able to pass the faster supercharged Graham so he settled for second position in his final car race. Axel Larsson from Falun in a Dodge finished third.\n\nThe Ford team I was the only team to finish the event intact with C-G Johansson (2nd), Eck (6th) and T. Johansson (8th). The Adler team was destroyed in the start crash and Servais crash into a ditch after 4 laps split the Ford team II.\n\nThe studs on most of the tyres were totally worn down at the end of the race."
