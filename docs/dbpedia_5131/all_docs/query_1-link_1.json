I have written several books and articles as well as co-editing a number of books on these topics. At present I am co-leader of a number of contemporary archaeological projects in Cuba, India and Sweden that, in co-operation with local communities, approaches different kinds of material and immaterial remains from, for example, former Soviet nuclear sites (Cuba) and industrial disasters in the third world (India and Thailand). I am also co-leader of a project discussing the authenticity, staging and public communication of world heritage classified rock art sites in Australia, Argentina, India, Italy, Mexico, Tanzania and Sweden.",
