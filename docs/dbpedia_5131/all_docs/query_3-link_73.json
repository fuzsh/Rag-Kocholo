        "text": "Animal studies indicate that early life vitamin D is crucial for proper neurodevelopment. Few studies have examined whether maternal and neonatal vitamin D concentrations influence risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Participants were sampled from the Stockholm Youth Cohort, a register-based cohort in Sweden. Concentrations of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) were assessed from maternal and neonatal biosamples using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. The maternal sample consisted of 449 ASD cases and 574 controls, the neonatal sample: 1399 ASD cases and 1607 controls; and the paired maternal-neonatal sample: 340 ASD cases and 426 controls. Maternal 25OHD was not associated with child ASD in the overall sample. However, in Nordic-born mothers, maternal 25OHD insufficiency (25 − <50 nmol/L) at ~11 weeks gestation was associated with 1.58 times higher odds of ASD (95% CI: 1.00, 2.49) as compared with 25OHD sufficiency (≥50 nmol/L). Neonatal 25OHD < 25 nmol/L was associated with 1.33 times higher odds of ASD (95% CI: 1.02, 1.75) as compared with 25OHD ≥ 50 nmol/L. Sibling-matched control analyses indicated these associations were not likely due to familial confounding. Children with both maternal 25OHD and neonatal 25OHD below the median had 1.75 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.86) times the odds of ASD compared with children with maternal and neonatal 25OHD both below the median. Our results are consistent with an increasing body of evidence suggesting that vitamin D concentrations in early life may be associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Developmental vitamin D and autism spectrum disorders\n\nT2 - findings from the Stockholm Youth Cohort\n\nAU - Lee, Brian K.\n\nAU - Eyles, Darryl W.\n\nAU - Magnusson, Cecilia\n\nAU - Newschaffer, Craig J.\n\nAU - McGrath, John J.\n\nAU - Kvaskoff, David\n\nAU - Ko, Pauline\n\nAU - Dalman, Christina\n\nAU - Karlsson, Håkan\n\nAU - Gardner, Renee M.\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: © 2019, The Author(s).\n\nPY - 2021/5\n\nY1 - 2021/5\n\nN2 - Animal studies indicate that early life vitamin D is crucial for proper neurodevelopment.
