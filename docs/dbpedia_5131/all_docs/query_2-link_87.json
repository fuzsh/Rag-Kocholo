        "text": "Punk Globe:\n\nThanks for the interview Hakan.. Tell us about where you and the band live in Sweden?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nMyself and the band live in a city called Gavle, Sweden and its in the middle of Sweden on the east coast. We had a really good punk scene from 77-86 with lots of bands.\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nWere you born there?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nPecka the singer is born in a city called Hudiksvall and its 160 km north of Gavle and also on the east coast. The rest of the band are from Gavle, and I and Pecka have known each other since kindergarten school and still are really good friends..\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nTell us about your band Peck and The Peckers?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nWe started playing in 1980 and broke up in 1983. But now we are on track again.. But we have all played in other punk bands in Gavle since 1978 . Even we we were playing with other bands, we would meet and play the music we love and talk memories from we were young. So now we don't play any of our own songs. We just songs that we really like. .Why write new songs when there is so many great song to play your in our own style... So we are an old school cover band of sorts..\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nHow long have you been together?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nWe have known each other for very long and have all played in other bands.. But with this line up in Peck and The Peckers we have been playing together for almost 2 years.. We keep moving on.\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nHow did you come up with the name?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nIts a play with the singers name..he`s name is Peter but called Pecka and peckers is our old enemies. They were the bad guys who drove around in big American cars and love to fight and hunt the punks so every fucking weekend when we was in the center of the city it was fights and a lot of running..\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nWho is in the band currently and what do they play?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nMats Jasse Jansson on drums, Tomas Felth on bass, Peter Pecka Alzï¿½n vocals, Ake Idol Karlsson on guitar and Hakan Frukten Bertilsson guitar.\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nHave you recorded anything?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nNo ,not yet! But we are about to get in the studio later in this year\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nWe all grew up with the old school punk, so many of the bands from76-79 are really great, so we really like bands like Wire, The Damned, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Stooges, The Ramones, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Agent Orange and of course Jayne County and The Electric Chairs. Which I think have recorded one of the best albums ever made... \"Storm The Gates Of Heaven..\"\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nTell us about your favorite show that you have played?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nOur last gig was really great.. It was in a small place which was sold out 3 hours before we started to play.. There we just about 170 in the audience. But it was really great..\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nTell the readers about the punk scene in Sweden?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nThe punk scene in Sweden was really great in 1977-1984.. Lots of bands all over Sweden, but then it was a bit slow for a while but many new punk bands in Sweden popping up... There are lots of really young kids who love to play the old school punk music that we grew up with.. And that's really nice.\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nWhat Swedish bands do you suggest that Punk Globe readers to check out?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nWell bands like Harda Tider, Asta kask, Ebba Gron,KSMB,Raised Fist and of course our punk mates in Gavle Los Piratos, and Robert Johnson & The Punchdrunks\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nTell us about your future plans?\n\nHakan Frukten Bertilsson:\n\nWe played a gig in August 31 for a friend who celebrated his 50Th birthday, and its on a club in Gavle City, Sweden. At first we just played for him and his friends but then we play for the whole club later in the evening. On September 28th the band along with two other punk bands Los Piratos and Jennie Was will be playing when I celebrate my 50th birthday with lots of new and old friends that are invited. But after we are out of the studio it will be easier to get shows..\n\nPunk Globe:\n\nThank you so much for the interview..
