        "text": "Exercise and diet are potent lifestyle interventions to combat metabolic dysfunction by improving weight management and glucose homeostasis. In particular, exercise enhances skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function (1). Nevertheless, such lifestyle interventions have poor adherence, requiring pharmacological advances to alleviate obesity and prevent metabolic disease. Consequently, efforts are under way to develop insulin sensitizers and weight-reducing pharmacological agents for the treatment of diabetes (2,3).\n\nSkeletal muscle is an important tissue involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis under insulin-stimulated conditions and is a major site of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (4,5). Although precise mechanisms of skeletal muscle insulin resistance are not fully elucidated, impaired insulin signaling and reduced glucose uptake are major aspects (4,5). Insulin resistance is present at all pathogenic stages of type 2 diabetes progression. Consequently, efforts to maintain skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity to prevent/delay type 2 diabetes are warranted. In addition to lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, new therapeutic routes to directly enhance skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, are of interest to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) urocortin (UCN) family of neuropeptides is a direct modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis both centrally and peripherally (6). Within this family are four peptides (CRF and UCN 1, 2, and 3) that are structurally related but encoded by separate genes (7). UCN peptides signal through two different G-protein–coupled receptors: corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (CRHRs) 1 and 2 (8). These peptides and receptors are differentially expressed in central and peripheral tissues (7,8). UCN1 binds to both receptors, while UCN2 and UCN3 are selective for CRHR2. Skeletal muscle has high expression levels of both UCN2 and its receptor CRHR2 (9). While emerging evidence suggests that CRF peptides regulate cardiovascular and renal function and inflammatory processes (10), their role in metabolic diseases is unclear.\n\nUCNs and CRHR2 play a role in glucose homeostasis. Ucn2 and Crhr2 knockout mice have enhanced glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity and are protected from high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity (11,12). HFD and/or elevated stress states upregulate skeletal muscle CRHR2 (13), while CRHR2 activation inhibits insulin signaling (14). Thus, increased CRHR2 activity impairs glucose homeostasis. In contrast, whole-body Ucn3 transgenic mice are protected from HFD-induced obesity (15), and transient overexpression of Ucn3 in skeletal muscle enhances glucose metabolism through increased insulin signaling (16). In addition, Ucn2 overexpression through systemic virus delivery improves whole-body insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed rodents (17). Accordingly, activating CRHR2 during obesity can also enhance glucose homeostasis. While the UCN-CRHR axis appears to regulate skeletal muscle metabolism, the predominant effects remain unclear.\n\nObservations of aerobic training–like phenotypes in transgenic mice (18–20) has ignited interest in developing pharmacological therapies to combat insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes (21). Given the role of the UCN-CRHR axis in skeletal muscle metabolism, we hypothesized that UCN peptides act as insulin sensitizers in skeletal muscle. Thus, we investigated the effects of a modified UCN2 peptide acting on the CHRH2 in HFD-induced obese mice, with a specific focus on skeletal muscle.\n\nTo investigate the metabolic effects of modified UCN2 peptide, male mice were fed an HFD for 20 weeks before daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle or compound A (0.3 mg/kg) for 14 days. Body weight was reduced in compound A–treated mice after day 1, with a cumulative weight loss of 7.5 g over the 14-day treatment period (Fig. 1A and B and Table 2). Weight loss in compound A–treated mice was accompanied by an 84% initial reduction in food intake compared with controls, which was followed by a 28% decrease at the end of the treatment period (Fig. 1C and Table 2). Thus, we noted a large decrease in food intake in the first several days and a smaller, but still significant decrease later in the treatment. The reduction in food intake after the first injection with compound A is likely due to an initial reduction in gastric emptying whereby a single compound A injection reduced gastric emptying by 52% compared with vehicle (Supplementary Fig. 1). Feed efficiency (the ratio of body weight change to food intake) was initially reduced 34% with compound A treatment, which was followed by a significant reduction at the end of the treatment period (Fig. 1D). Weight loss in compound A–treated mice was attributed to a decrease in fat mass without alteration in lean mass (Fig. 1E and Table 2). Compound A treatment reduced TAG content in TA muscle compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1F). Compound A treatment reduced liver weight without altering hepatic TAG or glycogen content (Table 1).\n\nTable 2\n\n. . HFD vehicle . HFD compound A . . Chow vehicle . Sedentary . Wheel running .

In vehicle-treated mice, wheel running reduced body fat mass (Fig. 1E) without altering lean mass (Table 2), and this was associated with reduced final body weight compared with sedentary mice (Table 2). Wheel running reduced the absolute and percent weight loss (Fig. 1A and B) and final body weight in compound A–treated mice compared with vehicle-treated wheel running mice (Table 2), despite less distance ran (Supplementary Fig. 2). The weight loss was attributed to decreased fat mass (Fig. 1E) without altering lean mass, liver weight (Table 2), or TA TAGs (Fig. 1F) compared with vehicle-treated wheel running mice. There were no synergistic effects with wheel running in the phenotypic improvements seen with compound A treatment alone. This highlights the potent nature of compound A on weight loss and fat mass reduction.\n\nIn the context of changing demographic patterns and the aging population, current pharmacological treatments to combat the majority of lifestyle-related conditions are inadequate. In particular, pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes that specifically target skeletal muscle to increase insulin sensitivity and preserve skeletal muscle function are lacking. In this regard, CRHR2 agonists may improve skeletal muscle substrate metabolism and mitigate aging-associated disorders. Here, we determined the effects of a modified UCN2 peptide in HFD, obese mice. We show that compound A treatment of HFD-fed mice results in an initial reduction in food intake and rapid weight loss, which was accompanied by improved whole-body glucose tolerance and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, this could be due to an effect on skeletal muscle because ex vivo stimulation of soleus muscle from lean chow-fed mice with compound A increased glucose uptake and insulin signaling. Thus, UCN2 peptides may be efficacious in the treatment of type 2 diabetes by acting as insulin sensitizers.\n\nGenetic manipulation of CRF family members alters body weight in mouse models. While body weight in Ucn2 knockout mice is unaltered after 16 weeks on an HFD, fat mass is reduced, and lean mass is increased (11). Conversely, overexpression of Ucn3, which also signals through CRHR2, increases body weight, with increased lean mass in chow-fed transgenic mice, whereas the HFD-fed transgenic mice are obesity resistant (15). These genetic models are at the whole-body level, and therefore, the contribution of a centrally mediated effect on metabolism cannot be excluded. Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological activation of CRHR2 with a modified UCN2 peptide reduced body weight in HFD-fed mice. These results are primarily localized to peripheral tissues because the PEGylated compound cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, strategies to activate CRHR2 in peripheral tissues appear to have positive effects on energy homeostasis. In accordance with our results, Ucn2 adeno-associated virus gene transfer attenuates weight gain in HFD-fed mice (17). Our results represent a pharmacological approach to activating the CRHR2 peripherally with a PEGylated UCN2 compound, whereas genetic models/approaches represent a supraphysiological event that may not portray the normal activity of the pathway. Our results also highlight potential discrepancies between activating CRHR2 with genetic models from birth versus transient activation of CRHR2 with pharmacological treatments.\n\nExercise and diet are considered a first-line treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. For many patients, pharmacological intervention is required to manage this disease, yet effective insulin sensitizers are lacking from the current diabetes pharmacopeia. Here, we provide evidence that UCN2 peptide treatment reduced fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in obese mice. Despite lower insulin levels during a GTT, compound A treatment enhanced glucose tolerance during a GTT compared with vehicle-treated obese mice, indicating that UCN2 treatment improves insulin sensitivity. This is consistent with an earlier study reporting that Ucn2 gene transfer improves glycemia and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed and db/db mice (17). Collectively, these results implicate peripheral action of UCN2 therapies for the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that compound A acts on the pancreas. UCN3, but not UCN2, is expressed in the β-cells of the pancreas and acts in an autocrine manner on CRHR2 to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin production and secretion, particularly in conditions of nutrient excess (28). Theoretically, the UCN2 peptide used here may activate pancreatic β-cell CRHR2 and stimulate insulin secretion; however, this remains to be determined.\n\nThe mechanistic basis of UCN2 treatment may involve enhanced insulin signaling. We have reported that insulin signaling and glucose transport are impaired in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes (4,5). Thus, targeting components of the canonical insulin signaling cascade or GLUT4 transport machinery in skeletal muscle may improve glucose homeostasis (29,30). Indeed, we found that UCN2 peptide treatment in HFD-fed mice increased Akt phosphorylation and protein abundance in skeletal muscle concomitant with enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Consistent with this, transient Ucn3 overexpression in skeletal muscle increases protein abundance of IRS1, Akt, TBC1D4, and GSK3α/β (16). Insulin-stimulated TBC1D4 phosphorylation at Ser318 was increased in response to compound A treatment, while phosphorylation at Thr642 was reduced compared with controls. However, the exact mechanisms by which CRHR2 affects insulin signaling are unknown. Nonetheless, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is increased in response to either acute or chronic compound A treatment. Moreover, we found that compound A acutely promoted GLUT4 translocation, which may account for the increased glucose clearance during the GTT as well as enhanced glucose uptake in isolated skeletal muscle. Improved glucose homeostasis by Ucn2 gene transfer in HFD-fed mice was attributed to increased GLUT4 translocation (17). Along with increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake, glycogen content was unaltered (data not shown), suggesting that compound A improved glucose metabolism by increasing glucose oxidation. Thus, the enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism in compound A–treated mice is not only due to a weight loss effect but also due to direct action on skeletal muscle.\n\nCRHR2 is differentially expressed in peripheral tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle (31), adipose tissue (32), skin (9), and the gastrointestinal tract (33), where it serves diverse functions. Activation of CRHR2 in the gastrointestinal tract is involved in gastric motility (34) and intestinal inflammation (35), while activation in cardiac tissue is involved in blood pressure regulation (36). In the current study, subcutaneous administration of compound A targets CRHR2, which is present throughout the periphery and could therefore have numerous effects in multiple organs controlling whole-body glucose and energy homeostasis. Selective agonists for UCN2 and UCN3 reduce gastric emptying (34,37). As such, we observed an initial decrease in food intake and a corresponding reduction in wheel running after the first day of treatment, which could be attributed to a decrease in gastric emptying and the accompanying malaise. By the end of the treatment period this effect was attenuated; however, without the inclusion of a pair-fed control group, the proportion of the metabolic effect during the in vivo treatment that was related to the reduced food intake is uncertain. Given the effect of compound A to reduce body weight, altered energy expenditure or thermogenesis could play a role. The hypothalamus is unlikely to be a direct target of compound A because of the PEGylation, which results in poor blood-brain barrier drug penetration. Thus, any potential neuroendocrine effect of compound A on energy homeostasis at the level of the hypothalamus is likely to be secondary. However, without the inclusion of a PEG-vehicle control, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of a central component of compound A on the regulation of energy homeostasis. We also do not believe that BAT is a major target of compound A because basal- or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was unaltered. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that non-insulin-mediated metabolic processes in BAT are affected. Skeletal muscle appears to be a direct target of compound A. Compound A directly increases GLUT4 translocation in L6 cells and increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling in isolated soleus muscle from chow-fed mice. Additionally, electroporation of skeletal muscle with a UCN2 plasmid increases glucose uptake. Thus, compound A has a direct and immediate effect on skeletal muscle metabolism independent of changes in adiposity. Our main findings related to the physiological effects of this approach to control skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and body weight is schematically highlighted (Fig. 5).\n\nCRHR2 activation in skeletal muscle enhances AMPK signaling, which increases glucose disposal (16,38) while also activating AMPK in cardiac tissues (39). However, in the current study, AMPK and downstream signaling, such as pACC (a surrogate marker for AMPK activation), was not altered (data not shown). In contrast, compound A treatment increased mTOR phosphorylation, implicating a role in anabolic processes. A role for IGF-I signaling in UCN3-mediated hypertrophy of soleus, tibialis cranialis, and gastrocnemius muscle and glucose disposal has also been proposed (15,16). However, plasma IGF-I levels after UCN2 treatment were unaltered (data not shown). Differences between these studies may be accounted for by the models studied (Ucn3 transgenic mice and overexpression in rats vs. subcutaneous injection in HFD mice) or the specific ligand used to activate CRHR2 (UCN3 vs. UCN2), resulting in different signaling/downstream effects. In support of this, signaling through either CRHR or G-protein–coupled receptors confers distinct conformational changes, which elicit different coupling of the G-proteins and activation of signaling cascades (40–42). Specifically, UCN1 binding to CRHR1 or CRHR2 leads to CREB and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, whereas CRF binding does not (43,44). Furthermore, Ucn2 gene transfer increases glucose disposal in mice, while Ucn3 gene transfer has no effect (45). Thus, the use of specific ligands may fine-tune specific effects on metabolic or gene regulatory pathways to influence glucose or energy homeostasis.\n\nExercise training increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle of obese patients and prevents type 2 diabetes progression (46,47). We determined whether UCN2 treatment and voluntary wheel running have a synergistic effect on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. In vehicle-treated obese mice, wheel running reduced hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin sensitivity during a GTT, while addition of compound A treatment produced negligible effects over the treatment alone. Thus, increased physical activity does not further enhance the insulin sensitizing effects of compound A possibly because of the potent nature of compound A treatment alone.\n\nG-protein–coupled receptors are the target of many modern pharmaceutical drugs. There are currently no pharmacological agents that target skeletal muscle for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. An agent that not only increases skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity but also reduces body weight would be highly desired to treat the growing metabolically perturbed population. Indeed, acute UCN2 peptide infusion is currently being tested clinically as an adjunct treatment in patients with heart failure (48–50), although a treatment for type 2 diabetes requires a more long-term regimen. In conclusion, our results fill a therapeutic void by providing new evidence for a treatment for type 2 diabetes that acts on skeletal muscle to enhance insulin sensitivity and glucose transport."
