        "text": "Mr. Hakan Anders Karlsson, 65, of Lewiston, Michigan, died on May 3, 2019 at Wellspring Lutheran Services in Fairview. He was born on September 11, 1953 to Oloaf and Dagny (Tieman) Karlsson in Sweden. He spent most his life in Sweden, having moved to Lewiston in 1999. He married his wife, Leeanne on June 23, 2000 on Mackinac Island. Hakan did computer work for many years, he supplied most of Scandinavia with software for universities, hospitals, and other offices. He also taught computers to individuals so that they could use this knowledge to gain employment for themselves. He loved horse races, enjoyed cooking and baking, and was an avid dancer. Hakan was a fan of Hockey, especially Sweden's national team. He enjoyed the outdoors, some of his favorite things to do were gardening and bird watching.\n\nHakan is survived by his wife Leeanne of Lewiston, Michigan; daughter Madelene (Henrik Norboom) Karlsson of Jonkoping, Sweden; sons, Fredrik and Hennrik Karlsson, both of Falkjoping, Sweden; 2 grandchildren, Alexander and William; and a brother Oivind (Birgitta) Karlsson of Bankryd, Sweden; and special friend, Carolyn. He was preceded in death by his parents, Oloaf and Dagny.\n\nAs were his wishes, cremation has taken place. There will be a memorial held in celebration of Hakan's life at Green Funeral Home on Thursday, May 16, 2019 at 12:00 PM. Visitation will be held at the funeral home from 11:00 AM until time of service. Condolence messages may be sent via our website at www.greenfuneralhomes.com. In lieu of flowers the family has suggested memorial donations be made to Hospice of Michigan."
