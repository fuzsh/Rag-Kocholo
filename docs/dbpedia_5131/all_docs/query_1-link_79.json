        "text": "This book presents new aspects of the U.S. \"multiple path\" policy toward Cuba that was designed and adopted after the Missile Crisis (October 1962) until the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, from a Cuban perspective. The policy was characterized by its contradictory profile, since simultaneously as aggressions were directed at Cuba, it also included the establishment of channels of communication with the Cuban government. The book also analyzes the Cuban–Soviet dispute during the same period. The Cuban experiences have still not been sufficiently discussed, and the aspects offered will enrich the knowledge of the U.S.–Cuban relationship during the mentioned period.\n\nPart I: Kennedy and the Anti-Cuban Policy After the October Crisis\n\nIntroduction to Part I\n\n1.
