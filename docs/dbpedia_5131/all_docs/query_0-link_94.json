It is Sweden's largest island.[6][7][8][9] The province includes the small islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the even smaller Karlsö Islands (Lilla and Stora) to the west. The population is 57,221,[2] of which about 23,600 live in Visby, the main town.[1] The island of Gotland and the other areas of the province of Gotland make up less than one percent of Sweden's total land area.\n\nThe island's main sources of income are agriculture along with food processing, tourism, IT solutions, design, and some heavy industry such as concrete production from locally mined limestone.[10] From a military viewpoint, it occupies a strategic location in the Baltic sea.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe island is the home of the Gutes (the tribal name of the Gotlandic people), and sites such as Ajvide show that it has been occupied since prehistory.[11] A DNA study conducted on the 5,000 year-old skeletal remains of three Middle Neolithic seal hunters from Gotland showed that they were related to modern-day Finns, while a farmer from Gökhem parish in Västergötland on the mainland was found to be more closely related to modern-day Mediterraneans. This is consistent with the spread of agricultural peoples from the Middle East at about that time.[12]\n\nEarly on, Gotland became a commercial center, with the town of Visby the most important Hanseatic city in the Baltic Sea.[13] In late medieval times, the island had twenty district courts (tings), each represented by its elected judge at the island-ting, called landsting. New laws were decided at the landsting, which also took other decisions regarding the island as a whole.[14]\n\nAmong medieval Scandinavian accounts discussing or mentioning Gotland are Gutasaga and the more legendary Hversu Noregr byggdist[15] and Orkneyinga saga.[16]\n\nOrkneyinga saga was written around 1200 CE by an unknown Icelandic author.[17] The Hversu account is only known to have survived in one single copy in Icelandic Flateyjarbók from 1387 CE, but may have been written earlier. According to Orkneyinga saga, Norwegian rulers were descendants of king Fornjót who \"reigned over Gotland, which we now know as Finland and Kvenland\". The Hversu account states that a descendant of Fornjót \"ruled over Gothland, Kvenland (Kænlandi), and Finland\".[17]\n\nGutasaga contains legends of how the island was settled by Þieluar and populated by his descendants. It also tells that a third of the population had to emigrate and settle in southern Europe, a tradition associated with the migration of the Goths, whose name has the same origin as Gutes, the native name of the people of the island. It later tells that the Gutes voluntarily submitted to the king of Sweden and asserts that the submission was based on mutual agreement, and notes the duties and obligations of the Swedish King and Bishop in relationship to Gotland.[18] According to some historians it is therefore not only an effort to write down the history of Gotland, but also an effort to assert Gotland's independence from Sweden.[19]\n\nIt gives Awair Strabain as the name of the man who arranged the mutually beneficial agreement with the king of Sweden; the event would have taken place before the end of the 9th century, when Wulfstan of Hedeby reported that the island was subject to the Swedes:\n\nThe Discovery of Muscovy –\n\nThen, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times Blekingey, and Meore, and Eowland, and Gotland, all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland was all the way on our right, as far as Weissel-mouth.[20]\n\nThe region is considered by some historians to be the original homeland of the Goths.[21]\n\nThe city of Visby and rest of the island were governed separately, and a civil war caused by conflicts between the German merchants in Visby and the peasants they traded with in the countryside had to be put down by King Magnus III of Sweden in 1288.[22] In 1361, Valdemar Atterdag of Denmark invaded the island.[23] The Victual Brothers occupied the island in 1394 to set up a stronghold as a headquarters of their own in Visby. At last, Gotland became a fief of the Teutonic Knights, awarded to them on the condition that they expel the piratical Victual Brothers from their fortified sanctuary.[14] An invading army of Teutonic Knights conquered the island in 1398, destroying Visby and driving the Victual Brothers from Gotland. In 1409 Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen of the Teutonic Knights guaranteed peace with the Kalmar Union of Scandinavia by selling the island of Gotland to Queen Margaret of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.[14]\n\nThe number of Arab dirhams discovered on the island of Gotland alone is astoundingly high. In the various hoards located around the island, there are more of these silver coins than at any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum is almost as great as the number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim world.[24] These coins moved north through trade between Rus merchants and the Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver-Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian merchants would help northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.[25]\n\nThe Berezan' Runestone, discovered in 1905 in Ukraine, was made by a Varangian (Viking) trader named Grani in memory of his business partner Karl. It is assumed that they were from Gotland.[26]\n\nThe Mästermyr chest, an important artefact from the Viking Age, was found in Gotland.[27][28]\n\nThe authority of the landsting was successively eroded after the island was occupied by the Teutonic Order, then sold to Eric of Pomerania and after 1449 ruled by Danish governors.[14] In late medieval times, the ting consisted of twelve representatives for the farmers, free-holders or tenants. Since the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, the island has remained under Swedish rule.[14][29]\n\nSpillings Hoard[]\n\nMain article: Spillings Hoard\n\nOn 16 July 1999, the world's largest Viking silver treasure, the Spillings Hoard, was found in a field at Spillings farm northwest of Slite.[30] The silver treasure was divided into two parts weighing a total of 67 kg (148 lb) (27 kg (60 lb) and 40 kg (88 lb)) and consisted mostly of coins, about 14,000, from foreign countries, mostly Islamic.[31] It also contained about 20 kg (44 lb) of bronze objects along with numerous everyday objects such as nails, glass beads, parts of tools, pottery, iron bands and clasps. The treasure was found by using a metal detector, and the finders fee, given to the farmer who owned the land, was over 2 million crowns (about US$308,000).[32] The treasure was found almost by accident while filming a news report for TV4 about illegal treasure hunting on Gotland.[33]\n\nAdministration[]\n\nThe traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes today, but are historical and cultural entities. In the case of Gotland, however, due to its insular position, the administrative county (län), Gotland County, and the municipality (kommun), Gotland Municipality, both cover the same territory as the province. Furthermore, the Diocese of Visby is also congruent with the province.[34][35][36]\n\nSockens[]\n\nGotland is traditionally divided into 92 sockens.[1]\n\nHeraldry[]\n\nGotland was granted its arms in about 1560.[37] The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: \"Azure a ram statant Argent armed Or holding on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third.\" The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same picture, but with other tinctures.\n\nThe Gotlandic flag displays the Gotlandic coat of arms, white on red ground, known from the 13th century in the shape of the seal of the Gutnish Republic with the proud ram. It reads: \"Gutenses signo xpistus signatur in agno\".\n\nGeography[]\n\nGotland is Sweden's largest island, and it is the largest island fully encompassed by the Baltic Sea (with Denmark's Zealand at the Baltic's edge).[6][7][8][9] With its total area of 3,183.7 km2 (1,229.2 sq mi) the island of Gotland and the other areas of the province of Gotland make up 0.8% of Sweden's total land area.[38] The province includes the small islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands, (Lilla and Stora) to the west, which are even smaller. The island of Gotland has an area of 2,994 km2 (1,156 sq mi), whereas the province has 3,183.7 km2 (1,229.2 sq mi) [3,151 km2 (1,217 sq mi) of land excluding the lakes and rivers].[39] The population is 57,221,[2] of which about 23,600 live in Visby, the seat of the municipality as well as the capital of the county.[1] About two-fifths of the island's population live in Visby.\n\nGotland is located about 90 km (56 mi) east of the Swedish mainland and about 130 km (81 mi) from the Baltic states, Latvia being the nearest. Gotland is the name of the main island, but the adjacent islands are generally considered part of Gotland and the Gotlandic culture:\n\nFurillen\n\nFårö\n\nGotska Sandön, a National park of Sweden\n\nThe Karlsö Islands (Stora Karlsö and Lilla Karlsö)\n\nLaus holmar\n\nUtholmen\n\nÖstergarnsholm\n\nThere are several shallow lakes located near shores of the island. The biggest is Lake Bästeträsk, located near Fleringe in the northern part of Gotland.\n\nGotland contains many popular beaches, such as Tofta Strand, and Hundfria strand.\n\nThe highest point of the island is Lojsta Hed which stands 82 m (269 ft) above sea level.\n\nGeology[]\n\nMain article: Geology of Gotland\n\nGotland is made up of a sequence of sedimentary rocks of a Silurian age, dipping to the south-east. The main Silurian succession of limestones and shales comprises thirteen units spanning 200 to 500 m (660 to 1,640 ft) of stratigraphic thickness, being thickest in the south, and overlies a 75 to 125 m (246 to 410 ft) thick Ordovician sequence.[40]\n\nIt was deposited in a shallow, hot and salty sea, on the edge of an equatorial continent.[41] The water depth never exceeded 175 to 200 m (574 to 656 ft),[42] and shallowed over time as bioherm detritus, and terrestrial sediments, filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery, when the sea was 50 to 100 m (160 to 330 ft), and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record.[40] Some sandstones are present in the youngest rocks towards the south of the island, which represent sand bars deposited very close to the shore line.[43]\n\nThe lime rocks have been weathered into characteristic karstic rock formations known as rauks. Fossils, mainly of rugose corals and brachiopods, are abundant throughout the island; palæo-sea-stacks are preserved in places.[44]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nThe island's main sources of income are agriculture along with food processing, tourism, IT solutions, design and some heavy industry such as concrete production from locally mined limestone. Most of Gotland's economy is based on small scale production.[45] In 2012, there were over 7,500 registered companies on Gotland.[46] 1,500 of these had more than one employee.[10]\n\nGotlands largest employers in 2012[47] Company Employees Gotlands Kommun (\"Gotland Municipality\") 5950 AB Svenska Spel (\"Swedish Games\") 425 Destination Gotland (Ferries and accommodations) 400 Försäkringskassan (\"Swedish Social Insurance Agency\") 375 PayEx (\"Payment solutions\") 325 Samhall AB (Providing employment for disabled persons) 275 Cementa (Concrete industry) 235 Högskolan Gotland (\"Gotland university\") 225 Attendo Sverige AB (Personal assistance) 175 Rikspolisstyrelsen (\"Police\") 175 COOP Gotland ek för.

In somewhat belated recognition of this fact, the Swedish government decided in March 2015 to begin reestablishing a permanent military presence on Gotland, starting with an initial 150 troop garrison,[48] consisting primarily of elements from the Swedish Army. It has been reported that the bulk of this initial garrison will make up a new motorised rifle battalion,[49] alternatively referred to in other reports as a \"modular-structured rapid response Army battalion\". A later report claimed that plans were at an advanced stage for a support helicopter squadron and an Air Force \"fast response Gripen jet squadron\" to also be based on the island to support the new garrison and further reinforce the defences.[50] Prior to the disbandment of the original garrison, there had been a continuous Swedish military presence on Gotland in one form or another, for nearly 200 years.[51]\n\nAfter the standing down of the original garrison, a battalion of the Swedish Home Guard is based on Gotland for emergencies as part of the Eastern Military Region (MR E). The unit, 32:a Gotlandsbataljonen (the 32nd Gotland battalion), acts as a reserve component of the Swedish Amphibious Corps.[52] Among the residual war reserve stocks reported to be still in storage on Gotland in March 2015, were 14 tanks[53] (Stridsvagn 122s) at the Tofta skjutfält (the Tofta firing range),[54][55] but without any crews or dedicated maintenance personnel assigned to them.[56]\n\nGotland currently has no local air defence capability.[57] Despite its importance as a naval base in the past,[58] as of 2014 , there are no naval units based out of Gotland.[57]\n\nThe Tofta firing range itself (also known as the Tofta Tank firing range), is a military training ground which is located 8 km (5.0 mi) south of Visby. Another less common name for the range is the Toftasjön firing range. Tracing its origins back to 1898, as of 2008 the range extended over 2,700 acres (11 km2). It was a major training and storage facility for the Gotland garrison during its existence, and was still occasionally used for training by various elements of the Armed Forces since the garrison was shut down in 2005. However, from the second half of 2014 onwards, there has been a marked increase in the use of the range, especially by armored units (mostly company sized),[55] as tensions in Northeastern Europe have escalated. At least one of the buildings on the range, the former tank repair shop, is currently owned by a private company (Peab), with the military renting back the top floor for its own use.[56]\n\nWhen not used by the military, a number of cultural and sports events have been held at the range, one of the most notable being the Gotland Grand National, the world's largest enduro race.[59]\n\nTourism[]\n\nThe first modern day tourists came to Gotland during the 19th century and were known as \"bathers\".[60] Gotland became very popular with socialites at the time through Princess Eugenie who lived in Västerhejde, in the west part of the island from the 1860s.[61][62]\n\nWhen a new law ensuring two weeks vacation for all employees in Sweden was passed in 1938, camping became a popular pastime among the Swedes, and in 1955, Gotland was visited by 80,000 people.[62] In the 1970s mostly young people were attracted to Gotland. Since 2010 the island has become a more versatile vacation spot visited by people from all over the world, in all manner of ways.[62]\n\nGotland is one of Sweden's most noted tourist destinations. In 2001 it was the fifth largest tourist destination in Sweden based on the total number of guest nights.[63] Gotland is usually the part of Sweden which receives the most hours of sunlight during a year with Visby statistically the location with the most sunshine in Sweden.[64] In 2007 approximately 750,000 people visited Gotland.[10]\n\nIn 1996, for the first time, ferries between Gotland and mainland Sweden carried more than 1 million passengers in a year. In 2007, the number of passengers exceeded 1.5 million.[65] In 2012, the ferries had 1,590,271 passengers and the airlines 327,255 passengers.[66]\n\nNumber of tourists from top five countries in 2012[67] Germany 31,664[68] Norway 16,350[68] Finland 13,620[68] Denmark 12,743[68] United States 2,983[68] Based on the number of commercial guest nights at hotels, cabins, hostels, camping and private lodgings.\n\nCruise ships and new pier[]\n\nThe main port of call on Gotland is Visby. The city is visited by a number of cruise ships every year.[69][70] About 40 cruise lines frequent the Baltic sea with Visby as one of their destinations.[71] In 2005, 147 ships docked at Visby, in 2010 the number was 69.[72] In 2014, 62 ships are scheduled to visit Visby.[73] The decrease in visiting ships is due to the fact that the modern cruise ships are too large to enter Visby harbor.[72] Ships must anchor a fair distance from shore whereupon passengers are shuttled to shore in small boats, which is not possible during bad weather.[74] In 2007, the first proposition for building a new pier at Visby harbor, large enough to serve the modern cruise ships, was made.[75] In 2011, the matter of the new pier was discussed in the Riksdag[76] and in 2012 research and planning for the pier began.[72] In January 2014 a letter of intent for building a new cruise pier in Visby harbor was signed by Region Gotland and Copenhagen Malmö Port (CMP). The pier is scheduled to be finished in 2018. The estimated cost is 250 million crowns (about US$38.52 million).[77][78]\n\nCulture[]\n\nA number of stones with grooves exist on Gotland. Archaeologists interpret these grooves as traces of an unknown industrial process in the High Middle Ages. There are approximately 3,700 grinding grooves, of which about 750 occur in the solid limestone outcrop and the rest in other rock formations. The latter often consist of hard rocks such as granite or gneiss, but also soft rocks such as sandstone occur.[79] Grinding grooves are also found in Skåne, in southern Sweden and in Finland. Astronomer Göran Henriksson dates a number of these grinding grooves to the Stone Age, from c. 3300 BCE to c. 2000 BCE, based on astronomical alignments,[80] although his methodology has been heavily criticized.[81]\n\nThe Medieval town of Visby has been entered as a site of the UNESCO World heritage programme. An impressive feature of Visby is the fortress wall that surrounds the old city, dating from the 13th century.[82]\n\nThe inhabitants of Gotland traditionally spoke their own language, known as Gutnish. Today however, they have adapted a dialect of Swedish that is known as \"Gotländska\".[83]\n\nIn the 13th century, a work containing the laws of the island, called \"the Gotlandic law\" (Gutalagen), was published in the ancient Gutnish language.[84]\n\nGotland is famous for its 94 medieval churches (see List of churches on Gotland),[85] most of which are restored and in active use. These churches exhibit two major styles of architecture: Romanesque and Gothic. The older churches were constructed in the Romanesque style from 1150–1250. The newer churches were constructed in the Gothic architectural style that prevailed from about 1250–1400. The oldest painting inside one of the churches on Gotland stretches as far back in time as the 12th century.[86]\n\nTraditional games of skill like Kubb, Pärk, and Varpa are played on Gotland. They are part of what has become called \"Gutniska Lekar\", and are performed preferably on the Midsummer's Eve celebration on the island, but also throughout the summer months. The games have widespread renown; some of them are played by people as far away as in the United States.[87]\n\nThe knotwork design subsequently named the \"Valknut\" has the most attested historic instances on picture stones in Gotland, which include being on both the Stora Hammars I and the Tängelgårda stones.[88] Gotland also has a rich heritage of folklore, including myths about the bysen, Di sma undar jordi, Hoburgsgubben and the Martebo lights.[89][90]\n\nGotland gives its name to the traditional farmhouse ale Gotlandsdricka, a turbid beer with much in common with Finnish sahti, and related beers from the Baltic states.[91]\n\nNotable Gotlanders[]\n\nChristopher Polhem (1661–1751), the father of Swedish mechanical physics, born in Visby, also called the \"Archimedes of the North\"\n\nIngmar Bergman, film director, lived on Fårö, the small island directly north of Gotland Island\n\nHåkan Loob, former ice hockey player in the NHL\n\nLennart Eriksson, also known as Fjodor, former punk star from Ebba Grön, moved to Gotland soon after he left the band in 1982\n\nSusanne Alfvengren, singer, famous in Sweden during the 1980s\n\nGrave, death metal band from Visby\n\nThomas Löfkvist, cyclist from Visby, occasionally referred to by his nickname \"Gotland\"\n\nTheresa Andersson, singer/composer/musician, currently living/working in the US\n\nHjördis Petterson, actress\n\nMats Karlsson, world's first professor of pharmacometrics\n\nTove Edfeldt, actress\n\nEinar Englund, composer\n\nBabben Larsson, comedian\n\nDukes and Duchesses of Gotland[]\n\nPrince Oscar 1859–1888 (lost title)\n\nPrincess Leonore 2014–\n\nSports events[]\n\nGotland competes in the biennial Island Games, which it hosted in 1999.[92] They will host the games for a second time in 2017.[93]\n\nRound Gotland Race-sailing event (\"ÅF Offshore Race\") starting at Stockholm, around the island of Gotland and back.[94]\n\nGotland Grand National (GGN) is an annual enduro race on Gotland. GGN is a part of the Swedish enduroklassikern (enduro classics, Ränneslättsloppet, Stångebroslaget and Gotland Grand National). GNN is the world's largest enduro race.[95][96]\n\nStångaspelen (\"the Stånga Games\") are the annual games for Gotlandic sports. The games are held during five days each summer at Stånga. The games are unofficially called \"the Gotland Olympic games\". Some of the sports at the Stångaspelen are pärk, varpa and caber toss.[87]\n\nSports organizations[]\n\nIn 2012, there were 171 registered sports organizations on Gotland.[97]\n\nGotland has two senior women's sport teams playing in the first tiers: basketball team Visby Ladies Basket Club (in Basketligan dam) and floorball team Endre IF (in the Swedish Super League).[98][99] Visby Ladies won the Swedish Championship in 2005.[100]\n\nFootball in the province is administered by Gotlands Fotbollförbund. The leading football club is FC Gute, playing in the fourth-tier league Division 2 as of 2014.[101]\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nThe Long Ships, or Red Orm (original title: Röde Orm), a best-selling Swedish novel written by Frans G. Bengtsson, contains a vivid description of Gotland in the Viking Age. A section of the book is devoted to a Viking ship setting out to Russia, stopping on its way at Gotland and engaging a pilot from the island who plays an important part in their voyage. Gotlanders of the Viking era are depicted as city people, more sophisticated and cosmopolitan than other Scandinavians of their time, and proud of their knowledge and skills.\n\nNaomi Mitchison, in her autobiographic book \"You may well ask\", relates an experience during a walking tour in Sweden: \"Over in Gotland I walked again, further than I would have if I had realized that the milestones were in old Swedish miles, so that my disappointing three-mile walk along the cold sea edge under the strange ancient fortifications was really fifteen English miles\".[102]\n\nThe crime novels of Mari Jungstedt, featuring Detective Superintendent Anders Knutas, are set on Gotland.\n\nIn the Battlefield Vietnam video game modification Invasion Gotland, the Soviet army invades Gotland in 1977.\n\nFor the 1989 Studio Ghibli film, Kiki's Delivery Service, by Hayao Miyazaki, he and other illustrators spent time in Gotland in preparation for animation.\n\nIn Season 2 of the 2013 historical drama Vikings, it is revealed that Ragnar Lodbrok's village is in Gotland, and he becomes the Jarl there.\n\nAstronomy[]\n\nA number of asteroids in the main-belt are named after places on Gotland.
