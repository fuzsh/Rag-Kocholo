        "text": "This presentation examines the English-invented team sports of cricket, rugby, and soccer (Association Football) as they arrived in the United States of America and what factors have led to their rise, fall, and perhaps now rise again. Despite fluctuations, these sports have not succeeded in obtaining a central place in the American sports psyche though definite changes have occurred over time. Through an examination of histories of sport in the United States, case study observations and conceptual analysis, I offer new perspectives on the complex relationship of these leading English games with the American sporting populace. Revised version of this Workshop paper will appear in the International Journal of the History of Sport, January 2014 issue along with other papers from the Workshop."
