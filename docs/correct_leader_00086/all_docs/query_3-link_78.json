        "text": "Of recent, there have been calls and pressures both from within and external for the need to visit the political systems in Africa and re- construct them in order to pacify and quietly give women local and national powers. These calls have been so loud that the violations and compromising of constitutions are considered of no substance. Women groups, civil society organizations are the loudest in the support of this concept, while international institutions like the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, European Union, World Bank and the Organization American States are now making it a policy in order for a country to secure loans and developmental assistance. With this approach, the World is gradually losing its saltiness in the area of democracy and good governance. There is no argument or justification one can give when analyzing the negative impact, exclusion and marginalization of women into state power and decision making of the body politics of African countries. In the highest decision making of governments, which are the legislature, Parliament, President or Prime Minister, depending on which political system one is critiquing, women are negligible. So therefore, it is the right of all nations and people to make their contribution in empowering women in politics. But the processes and procedures being taken by internal and external bodies are becoming threat to the very democratic principles and good governance we have envisaged.\n\nThe history of women fight for equal rights, political emancipation, decision making in both local and national politics and the direct participation of women in political activities at the highest level is of no strange news or phenomenon to Africa. But from North, South, East and West of Africa the liberation struggle of women were fought by women that never begged, appealed, or compromised their principles just for state power. Africa has and had women who have resisted all political turbulences and proven on the contrary that women can do that which men have done and are doing. Examples of such great mothers of Africa are:\n\nHuda Shaarawi, a pioneering Egyptian activist, who encouraged women to demonstrate both against British rule and for their own rights. Born in a harem at the end of the 19th century, she shocked 1920s Cairo by tearing off her veil in public. She went on to help found some of the first feminist organizations in the Arab world.\n\nElisabeth Domitien, Prime Minister of the Central African Republic from January 3, 1976 to April 7, 1975. Due to her staunch principle and allegiance to the rule of law and the constitution, Jean-Bedel Bokassa dismissed her from office and convicted her for covering up extortion.\n\nNana Yaa Asantewa (the Commander In Chief) from the Asante State of Edweso is considered the most resilient and reactionary woman of Africa. She was the military leader in what is known as the ‘Yaa Asantewa War’, which was the last war between the Asante and the British. Because of her bravery and leadership ability she was referred to by the British as the ‘Joan D’Arc of Africa.\n\nQueen Nzinga also known as Queen Jinga was from the present day Angola. She was highly known for her gender sensitive role in government. She appointed women to important positions in her administration. She formed a powerful army that fought the Portuguese. She even formed an alliance with the Dutch in order to prevent the Portuguese advancement in her territory.\n\nFunmilayo Anikulapo Ransome Kuti, the Activist,( the mother of Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti), is considered the first female political activist of modern Nigeria. Her feminism and democratic socialism led to the creation of The Abeokuta women’s union (AWU) which later transformed to the Women’s International Democratic Federation (WIDF). This organization mission and policy was women’s rights to education, employment and political participation.\n\nAgathe Uwilingiyimana, Prime Minister of Rwanda (18 July 1993 to 7 April 1994). She was murdered in the genocide while saving her children.\n\nRuth Perry, Chairman of the Council of State of Liberia (1996-1997), was Africa first Modern Female Head of State.\n\nLuisa Dias Diogo, Prime Minister of Mozambique (2004-2010). She was once on the Forbes’s magazine list of The Most Powerful Women in the World.\n\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf, (2005-present) the First Elected democratic President of Africa when she won the Liberian 2005 and 2011 presidential elections.\n\nFor centuries, women in Africa have fought and ruled, written, taught, done business, explored, and revolted against the old establishments. Some of these women we know and some we may never know because history has failed to document them all. Whether written or not, one thing we can never erased from history is the importance of women in Africa developments.\n\nThe threshold, policies and laws passed by national parliaments in Africa for women to participate in politics are all undemocratic, unconstitutional and against the very will of the people we try to protect. First and foremost, it is important we define what we mean by democracy and election. Democracy is defined as a form of government created by the people; governed by the people and for the people. That means that all the people should be able to have their say in one way or another in everything that affects their lives. It is a government that must not be impose by anybody or institution but directly elected by the people and representation of the people. Election is the process through which citizens or people with the same interest can choose, vote and select their own candidates. The Republican system of democracy that involves the citizens’ direct role in appointing/ electing their leaders becomes a sole responsibility of the people. And Proportional Representative is a form of government that elect leaders based upon the percentage of vote a political party has during the election. The party with the highest votes or percentage forms a government and seats are distributed based upon listing. This has little effect of citizens’ direct representation or election of leaders. This type of electoral system is being practiced in South Africa, Rwanda etc. Does this election tell you about women or elected officials popularity and direct contribution to the people?\n\nBy now I am of the view that readers, women’s groups and political activists might see this article as anti-women, but this is not the case. We are all campaigning for women to have direct involvement in the body politics through direct representation and participation due to their different and feminist relationship with government institutions and public policy than that of men therefore meriting equal representation in government. President Paul Kigame once said, that the women that are in his government are the ones giving him the desire and the fight for development in his country. So do we see the level of contributions women have in political participation? Politics is not about sympathy or begging, rather, it is the act of the battle of the mind and direct representation. It is about advocacy, votes, policy making and the fight for power. Therefore setting up thresholds, enacting laws and even making it a policy are all anti democracy and reduce the relevant of studying political science and practicing the game. It reduces the saltiness of democracy and election. Legislating laws and threshold in favor of women or any other gender also make them vulnerable to politics and their constituents. These laws do not give women the leverage to directly campaign among voters for votes. In Liberia of recent, the Upper House of the National Legislature (Liberia National Legislature is divided into two houses; the House of Senate and the House of Representation) attempted passing a law making it mandatory for every political party to have 30% of women candidates on their lists to the National Elections Commission. This to me is a political witticism and an appeasement to women and Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. In the first place, Liberia is not practicing PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION; constitutionally, it is not legal to impose a candidate on a people or a political party. The constitution of Liberia gives every citizen the right to participate in any election and for every political party to elect their candidate through PRIMARY. Changing of the law MIGHT only be done through a REFERENDUM. And even if 30% of candidates are women on a party ticket, does that give them the assurance of being elected? Because where a political party candidate is a woman another political party candidate might likely be a male, and if he is elected by the people there is no right or law preventing the winner from taking seat. And lastly, a political party can NEVER be held accountable if there is no competent or willingness of a woman to contest for a seat. Please note that election is not about placing names on party’s list but capturing power by all means, and every party will contest an election with the best candidates that are most likely to win.\n\nIn my view, I recommend the following every government, institution, Civil Society Organization must do in order for the World to see a Gender Political Leadership:\n\nMake sure every GIRL CHILD MUST to school just like her boy companion. This should be enforced by government and society;\n\nWomen activists and politicians that have interest in an election or power be encouraged through providing them with campaign logistics, political awareness, and if possible, some level of campaign funding;\n\nThe UN, EU, AU ECOWAS, WORLD BANK, IMF should make it a policy to set aside funding for women and elections even though it might sound evil;\n\nGovernment and society MUST make sure that NO LAW be created and implemented that will directly or indirectly prevent women from participation.\n\nCultures and traditions that prevent women’s participation in local and national election MUST BE RE-VISITED/ ABOLISHED;\n\nEncourage young girls and women to study about government and leadership\n\nI am once more hundred percent sure that this article will definitely be attacked by women that are in today’s politics and not by girls that are preparing themselves academically and financially. The girls of today are now studying the factors that lead to the failure of women in elections and politics. The world must be careful on handling elections issues and constitutional matters, if not I foresee a threat to democracy in Africa in the near distance future. Example of such political mistake is the Arab Spring and the quest for democracy in Africa. The urgent democratic changes led to the serious civil wars in Africa in the 1990s and now in the Middle East.\n\nPhillip Saa Tali,Jr is the Executive Director, a Liberian and political scientist, analyst and commentator who has a Masters in International Relations and Democracy. He has written several articles on Liberian, Africa and the World government and politics."
