        "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) continues to face a protracted complex emergency that is generating severe protection violations, widespread displacement, and humanitarian needs. An estimated 2.8 million people require humanitarian assistance in 2024, according to the UN. Meanwhile, as of April 2024, an estimated 518,000 people remained internally displaced due to conflict and climatic shocks, a majority of whom reside with host communities near their areas of origin. Insecurity in neighboring countries—including Chad and Sudan—has also prompted tens of thousands of people to seek refuge in areas in CAR where humanitarian needs are already high and resources are scarce. To address emergency needs resulting from persistent insecurity and displacement in CAR, USAID funding supports the provision of life-saving commodities and services to internally displaced persons, host communities, returnees, refugees, and food-insecure populations, including agricultural inputs, food assistance, health care, non-food relief items, as well as nutrition, shelter, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene support. In addition, USAID supports humanitarian coordination, information management, and logistics for improved service delivery across CAR.\n\nRelated Links"
