        "text": "Introduction: yaws is endemic in the Central African Republic. The last cases of yaws notified by CAR to WHO date back to 2012. The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of yaws in the health district of Mbaïki and to describe its clinical and epidemiological characteristics.\n\nMethods: this is a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted from April 10 to 18, 2020 in the Mbaïki health district. Yaws cases were sought in 570 households in the 38 selected villages of the district. Any consenting individual over the age of one year with yaws-like skin lesions was a suspected case of yaws and included in the study. Blood was taken from suspected cases for serological testing (TDR, RPR and TPHA). Any suspected case of yaws with positive RPR and TPHA was considered a confirmed case.\n\nResults: a total of 1967 people were examined, of whom 113 were considered suspected cases of yaws. All suspected cases were RPR-positive, 41 TPHA-positive and 13 RDT-positive. Forty-one cases of yaws were confirmed in 18 (47.37%) villages. The prevalence of yaws in the Mbaïki health district was 2.08%. Among the cases, 38.94% were children aged 1 to 14. The sex ratio was 1.69. Lesions clinically suggestive of yaws were papilloma-like in 77.00% of cases, followed by micropapules (8.00%) and ulcerations (5.00%)."
