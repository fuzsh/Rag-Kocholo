        "text": "Table 1 provides key indicators on children’s work and education in the Central African Republic. Data on some of these indicators are not available from the sources used in this report.\n\nTable 1.

(2)\n\nBased on a review of available information, Table 2 provides an overview of children's work by sector and activity.\n\nTable 2.

(4,11,12) In 2019, the government and 14 armed groups signed the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic (APPR), which called for the immediate cessation of recruitment of child soldiers by all parties involved in the conflict. (13,14) However, an attempt by six of those armed groups to overthrow the government following the December 2020 elections stalled implementation of the APPR. (3,5,8,9,15) During the reporting period, anti-Balaka-affiliated armed groups and ex-Séléka factions—including Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation; Popular Front for the Central African Renaissance; Union of Patriots for Change; and the Lord’s Resistance Army—recruited and used children as combatants, informants, messengers, cooks, and porters. (4,10,12) The United Nations verified a total of 134 children were recruited and used during the reporting period by all parties in the conflict, including the pro-government Kremlin-backed Wagner Group forces, the Central African Armed Forces (FACA), and several other armed groups. While these other armed groups committed a majority of the verified violations, government and pro-government forces were found to be responsible for 46 violations, including using children to cook, operate checkpoints, and run errands. (4,5,12)\n\nArmed groups and criminal elements, including some pastoralist groups, subjected children to forced domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. (9,10,16) In some instances, relatives or family friends exploited children to generate additional income. (3,9) Girls may be trafficked into forced domestic work. In maisons de joie, girls as young as age 13 are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation. Maisons de joie are typically private residences at which alcohol and food are served to middle and upper-class customers. (3,6,10) Furthermore, children in rural areas are forced to work in diamond and gold mines, often for long hours and without protective equipment. Children working in mines are sometimes exploited by armed groups and are often exposed to harmful substances, including hazardous chemicals such as silver nitrate and mercury, and may suffer from injuries and waterborne diseases. (3-5,8,10)\n\nFewer than 60 percent of children in the Central African Republic complete their primary school education, and only 6 percent graduate from secondary school. (17) Violence and insecurity exacerbate barriers to education access, particularly for girls. (3,11,18,19) Although state security forces have extended their presence through most of the national territory since 2021, schooling is disrupted and schools often closed outside the capital by frequent clashes between CAR’s warring parties. (4,5) Other barriers to education include displacement due to conflict, and the occupation of some school buildings by armed groups, including the Kremlin-backed Wagner forces. (4,12) Children also continue to experience difficulties accessing education due to school fees, shortages of basic infrastructure, an absence of teachers, security concerns, and destruction or looting of school materials and buildings by armed groups. (4,10,11,20,21) Due to insecurity, conflict, and limited resources, the government has failed to fully implement a provision of the 2020 Child Protection Code (CPE) to provide free birth registration for all children, and many municipal governments continue to levy fees on birth registration and other vital records. (4,22) Moreover, reporting suggests that members of CAR's minority Muslim population and people with names perceived to be Muslim faced discrimination and higher fees when trying to obtain new or replacement identification documents, leaving Muslim children more likely to be undocumented and unable to enroll in school. (4,5) Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education has attempted to improve access to education by waiving school entrance exam fees for children affected by conflict, and expanding programs to provide birth registration, as identification is required for school enrollment. (4,23)\n\nThe government has established institutional mechanisms for the enforcement of laws and regulations on child labor (Table 5). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate enforcement of their child labor laws.\n\nTable 5. Agencies Responsible for Child Labor Law EnforcementOrganization/AgencyRole & ActivitiesMinistry of Labor (MOL)Monitors and enforces laws related to child labor through its General Directorate of Labor and Social Welfare, and the seven regional labor directorates. (3,24)Ministry of Justice (MOJ)Oversees Juvenile Court, established under the 2020 Child Protection Code (CPE) to field all cases involving the health, safety, morals, and education of children. Maintains sole jurisdiction over criminal cases involving juvenile plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, and victims of crime, including former child soldiers. (22) Oversees a special police unit for children, which is responsible for monitoring children's safety and welfare in large cities, and industrial or mining areas. (22,30) This unit is also responsible for recording criminal offenses against children. The judges are responsible for working with the police, the Child Protection Unit, the Children's Prosecutor, and social workers to refer child victims and monitor compliance with diversion measures. (22,24)Mixed Unit for Rapid Intervention and Repression of Sexual Violence to Women and Children (UMIRR)Aims to put a stop to sexual violence against women and children, including child trafficking. Interagency law enforcement unit that includes representatives from the Ministry of Social Affairs; MOJ; the Ministry of Public Security; law enforcement (gendarmerie and police); and social workers. (3,4,16,23,35) Operates a 24-hour hotline to report cases of violence against women, and provides social services to survivors of human trafficking. (3,4,35) Operates in Bangui, the capital city, and Bouar, a town in the northwestern part of the country. (31,35) Falls under the joint authority of MOJ and the Ministry of Public Security, and is part of a state organization supporting investigations into conflict-related sexual violence. (16,36,37)\n\nLabor Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, labor law enforcement agencies in the Central African Republic took actions to address child labor (Table 6). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate labor law enforcement, including insufficient resource allocation.\n\nTable 6. Labor Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Labor Law Enforcement20212022Labor Inspectorate Funding$1,727 (3)Unknown (4)Number of Labor Inspectors167 (3)167 (4)Mechanism to Assess Civil PenaltiesYes (24)Yes (24)Training for Labor Inspectors ProvidedYes (3)Yes (4)Number of Labor Inspections Conducted at Worksite10 (3)Unknown (4)Number of Child Labor Violations FoundUnknown (3)Unknown (4)Number of Child Labor Violations for Which Penalties Were ImposedUnknown (3)Unknown (4)Number of Child Labor Penalties Imposed that Were CollectedUnknown (3)Unknown (4)Routine Inspections ConductedYes (3)No (4)Routine Inspections TargetedYes (3)N/A (4)Unannounced Inspections PermittedYes (24)Yes (24)Unannounced Inspections ConductedYes (3)Unknown (4)Complaint Mechanism ExistsYes (3)Yes (4)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Labor Authorities and Social ServicesYes (3)Yes (4)\n\nThe government did not provide information on its labor law enforcement efforts, including labor inspectorate funding, number and type of inspections, number of violations found, penalties imposed and collected. However, reporting suggests that the number of inspections conducted during the reporting period was insufficient. (4) Insecurity, as well as inadequate financial and material resources, including transportation and fuel, office facilities and supplies, and technology, hindered the government's efforts to conduct inspections and address child labor. (3,4,23,38) In addition, inspectors may be provided transportation by employers, which threatens the impartiality and independence of inspections. (38)\n\nMoreover, the passage of Decree No. 12.177 in 2012 effectively removed regional labor directorates from the general directorate's chain of command, resulting in regional directorates no longer being required to submit periodic reports on inspection activities, as required under ILO C. 81. (39) In addition, labor inspectors do not always issue formal penalties or sanctions. Instead, the conciliation of labor disputes makes up a significant part of inspectors' work. (9,24,38) The Ministry of Labor (MOL) works with other ministries and UNICEF to provide assistance to survivors of child labor, including its worst forms. However, due to a lack of resources, NGOs and UN bodies, such as the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA) and UNICEF, provide most of the social services available to survivors. (4,40,41)\n\nCriminal Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, criminal law enforcement agencies in the Central African Republic took actions to address child labor (Table 7). However, gaps exist within the operations of criminal enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate criminal law enforcement, including detaining children who were subjected to the worst forms of child labor.\n\nTable 7. Criminal Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Criminal Law Enforcement20212022Training for Criminal Investigators ProvidedYes (3)Yes (4)Number of InvestigationsUnknown (3)Unknown (4,5)Number of Prosecutions Initiated1 (3)Unknown (4,5)Number of Convictions1 (3)Unknown (4)Imposed Penalties for Violations Related to the Worst Forms of Child LaborNo (3)Unknown (4)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Criminal Authorities and Social ServicesYes (3)Yes (4)\n\nThe government did not provide information on its criminal law enforcement efforts for inclusion in this report, including the number of investigations, number of prosecutions, number of convictions, and penalties imposed. (4) During the reporting period, officers in the Mixed Unit for Rapid Intervention and Repression of Sexual Violence to Women and Children (UMIRR) received training on new standard operating procedures (SOPs) to identify trafficking cases and refer survivors to assistance services. In August 2022, Focal Point for Child Protection delivered a trafficking in persons training series at three military installations. (31) Among training participants were customs officers and migration and border security agents. One session was also attended by senior members of the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group in CAR. (5,31) The government also held training sessions on child trafficking and child labor in conflict zones for senior law enforcement and security forces. During the reporting period, UMIRR responded to several cases of human rights violations involving children, which were reported as a result of calls to its 24-hour hotline. (4) In November 2022, UMIRR also collaborated with Wagner forces and the International Committee of the Red Cross to repatriate a group of Cameroonian migrant children in CAR, who had been kidnapped by an armed group and forced to work at a rebel camp. (5,31,42)\n\nDuring the reporting period, some children accused of aiding armed groups were detained in facilities for incarcerated adults. (4,5) In December of 2022 all remaining children who had been detained for aiding armed groups were released following a presidential clemency decree. (4,5,12,31,43) Reporting suggests that the released children were accused of working for armed groups at checkpoints, securing mining sites, running errands, and as child soldiers. The government worked with UNICEF to reintegrate the children by providing access to community care centers and foster homes or returning the children to their families. (4,31) While the government has a referral mechanism for authorities and social services to refer children found to be subjected to the worst forms of child labor, due to resource constraints, NGOs and UN agencies were the primary actors involved in monitoring and managing such cases. Government authority and enforcement capacity remains constrained in remote areas of the country. (4)"
