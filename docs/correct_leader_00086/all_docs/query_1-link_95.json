Interest in a panel that we co-organized at the meeting led us to recognize the need for an authentically comparative approach to understanding the role of women in African legislatures. Subsequently, we worked to secure a group of international scholars to contribute to this project. We would like to thank all those contributors for their hard work in crafting such in-depth analyses and for their patience in working through the drafts of their chapters. We would also like to thank the African women parliamentarians who took time to work with each of us so that we could better understand the challenges they face. A special note of gratitude is due to the legislators who agreed to have their interviews published in the appendix so that they could explain in their own words their accomplishments and the obstacles that remain. We would like to thank Lynne Rienner and her staff for their enthusiastic support of this project from its inception. Lisa Tulchin and Shena Redmond were invaluable in this process, and we appreciate their thoughtful reading of this work and careful editing of the final manuscript. We are also grateful for the comments and contributions of two anonymous reviewers. Finally, we would like to acknowledge our respective institutions, the University of Delaware and the University of Kansas, for their financial and professional support of the project. On a personal note, this project has been a rewarding and valuable experience for both of us. Collaborative work can bring out either the best or the worst in people, and we are happy to report that the former vii\n\n00_FM.qrk 12/6/05 2:09 PM Page viii\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nis true in our case. After spending countless hours on e-mail, on the phone, and in person working through our manuscript, we feel we have a text that reflects the depth and breadth of the field and that we hope will contribute to a better understanding of political representation. We are also grateful for the support and understanding of our families and friends as we completed this project.\n\n00_FM.qrk 12/6/05 2:09 PM Page ix\n\nMadeira Island\n\nM e d i t e r r a n e a n\n\nTunisia\n\nMorocco\n\nS e a\n\nCanary Islands\n\nAlgeria Libya\n\nWestern Sahara\n\nEgypt\n\nMauritania\n\nRed Sea\n\nMali Senegal Gambia Guinea Guinea Bissau Sierra Leone Liberia\n\nNiger Burkina Faso Benin Côte Togo d'Ivoire Ghana\n\nEritrea\n\nChad Sudan\n\nDjiboutiGulf of Aden Somalia\n\nNigeria Ethiopia\n\nCentral Africa Republic Cameroon\n\nGulf of Guinea\n\nEquatorial Guinea São Tomé and Principe A T L A N T I C O C E A N\n\nGabon\n\nUganda\n\nCongo\n\nKenya\n\nRwanda Democratic Republic Burundi of Congo Tanzania\n\nZanzibar Island\n\nComoros\n\nAngola Zambia\n\nMalawi Mozambique\n\nZimbabwe Namibia\n\nMadagascar\n\nBotswana Swaziland\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAfrica\n\nLesotho\n\nI N D I A N O C E A N\n\n00_FM.qrk 12/6/05 2:09 PM Page x\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 1\n\n1 Women in African Parliaments: A Continental Shift? Gretchen Bauer and Hannah E. Britton\n\nIn October 2003, less than a decade after the merciless genocide that claimed the lives of nearly one million people in a matter of months, the tiny East African country of Rwanda elected thirty-nine women to its eighty-member Chamber of Deputies. Overnight Rwanda replaced Sweden as the country with the highest percentage of women in its national legislature.1 For decades a group of Scandinavian and Northern European countries had led the world in women’s representation in parliament, with percentages ranging from 35 to 45 percent by the early 2000s. Such high percentages represented a slow and steady increase over time and resulted from a combination of factors, including the secularization of society, the development of an extended welfare state, women’s increasing educational attainment and labor force participation, pressure from women’s organizations on receptive social democratic political parties, and the selective use of particular electoral systems and party-based gender quotas (Dahlerup 2004). By contrast, in the course of just one election the percentage of women in Rwanda’s national legislature had jumped to 48.8 percent. Rwanda is not alone in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last decade several African countries have moved from the very bottom to the very top of the list of countries in terms of women’s representation in national legislatures. South Africa and Mozambique paved the way with elections in 1994 that saw significant numbers of women (25 percent) elected to their respective parliaments; in elections in 2004 both countries achieved a better than 32 percent representation of women in their national legislatures. In early 2005 three other African countries—Seychelles, Namibia, and Uganda—all had women in at least 24 percent of seats in their lower 1\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 2\n\n2\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nor single houses of parliament. In other African countries women activists and women politicians were busy mobilizing civil society organizations and pressuring political parties to follow suit. This is a noteworthy development in a world in which regional averages for women’s representation in parliaments range from 6 percent in the Arab states to only 18 percent in the Americas (approaching 40 percent only in the above-mentioned Nordic states).2 This is also a remarkable achievement on a continent where women continue to lag behind even their developing world counterparts in any number of socioeconomic indicators, far surpassing them only in the HIV/AIDS infection rate.3 In this book we examine women’s national political representation in six African countries. We explain how in five of those countries— Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda—significant advances in women’s political representation have been realized despite pervasive gender inequality, patriarchal social relations, and historically male-dominated politics. In one other case investigated in this book—Senegal—women have not realized the same gains, and we explore why this is so. In addition, we provide a preliminary assessment of the impact and experiences of African women parliamentarians once in office. Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda have been chosen because they represent the five continental African countries among the top twenty-five worldwide in terms of women’s representation in national legislatures. Senegal, with a lower, but growing, level of representation, provides an interesting countercase from West Africa.4 Together the six countries offer a sampling of African countries from the eastern, western, and southern regions as well as Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone traditions. Though women members of parliament (MPs) outside Africa have attracted extensive scholarly notice (for example, Ross 2002; Tremblay 2005), African women parliamentarians, as a group, largely have not.5 In recent years a few case studies have investigated women MPs in a single African country (Tamale 1999; Geisler 2000; Britton 2005; Bauer 2004).6 In addition, three quantitative studies (Yoon 2001, 2004; Lindberg 2004) have examined the impact of a series of specific variables on women’s parliamentary representation in Africa. Both approaches have their limitations. In this book we seek to move beyond single case studies and narrow quantitative approaches to provide a comparative study of African women MPs based on qualitative data gathered during lengthy field research in several African countries. In so doing, we hope to fill a wide gap in the comparative literature on women’s political participation and representation around the world.\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 3\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n3\n\nWhy Elect More Women to Parliament?\n\nSeveral arguments are made for increasing the level of women’s political representation in elected office. Anne Phillips (1998, 228) identifies four groups of arguments: “There are those that dwell on the role model successful women politicians offer; those that appeal to principles of justice between the sexes; those that identify particular interests of women that would otherwise be overlooked; and those that point towards a revitalized democracy that bridges the gap between representation and participation.” Phillips (1998, 228–238) privileges three of these four arguments, asserting that achieving gender parity in political representation is necessary because for men to monopolize representation is “patently and grotesquely unfair,” because changing the composition of elected assemblies will help to increase and enhance democracy, and because without such change women’s needs, interests, and concerns will not be adequately addressed. Although Phillips does not favor the “role model” argument, others have noted the powerful positive impact upon future elections of electing the first women into political office (Dahlerup 1988; Reynolds 1999; Lindberg 2004). But can it be assumed that women’s interests will be better represented simply by electing more of them to national legislatures? In general the literature on women’s representation in legislatures draws a distinction between “descriptive” (or demographic) representation and “substantive” (or strategic) representation.7 Anne Marie Goetz and Shireen Hassim (2003, 5) view this as the difference between a “feminine presence” and a “feminist activism” in politics. Richard Matland and Michelle Taylor (1997, 201) note that the degree of descriptive representation in a legislative body is important for three reasons: First, to the degree that groups are excluded because of some descriptive attributes (color, sex), the polity does not benefit from the talents of that portion of the population. To the degree that women are denied access, society loses the contributions of 50 percent of its most talented people. Second, to the degree that underrepresented groups have different perspectives on public issues, denying them access impoverishes the public debate. . . . Third, to the degree that these groups have different policy priorities, their lack of representation means the priorities of the elected assembly will not be representative of the public as a whole.\n\nGoetz and Hassim (2003, 5) suggest that the distinction between descriptive and substantive representation may be overdrawn. In their\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 4\n\n4\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nview it may be more useful to consider descriptive representation as “a necessary first step to the institutional transformation that is required if substantive representation is to be achieved.” Underlying the notion of substantive representation, of course, is an assumption that there is a set of issues or interests that may be considered women’s issues or interests and that once in office women will seek to act upon these. As Joni Lovenduski (1997, 718) notes for women parliamentarians, in order for them to make a difference, “it is necessary for women MPs to have distinct views on women’s issues, to bring a women’s perspective into political decision-making, or to bring a different style and set of role expectations to politics.” A large literature, based primarily on the experience of women legislators in the developed countries, suggests that women politicians at the local and national levels are making a difference in terms of policy and implementation; indeed, they are representing women’s interests (see Thomas 1991, Hyland Byrne 1997, Matland and Taylor 1997, Bochel and Briggs 2000, and Sainsbury 2004). In Britain, for example, Lovenduski and Pippa Norris (2003, 100) find that women in all the major parties “do bring a different set of values to issues affecting women’s equality, in the workplace, home, and public sphere,” and conclude that with time “the entry of more women into Westminster has the capacity to make more than simply a symbolic difference to the face of British representative democracy.” Now that they are 45 percent of MPs, women in Sweden have made two further advances with significant implications for elected women everywhere. First, according to Diane Sainsbury (2004, 65), they have “redefine[d] women’s issues as demands for gender equality.” In so doing, “they have transformed women’s issues, which were earlier regarded as peculiar to women who were a special minority, into major party issues. In effect this change recast the conditions for substantive representation.” Second, they succeeded in “gendering the demand for greater democracy. Framing the issue of women’s representation in this way strategically converted political women from a minority within each of the parties into a majority of the citizenry—improving the potential for descriptive representation.” Finally, it has been argued that translating women’s descriptive representation into an effective substantive representation requires that a critical mass of women—at least 30 percent—be elected into a given legislative body. The concept of critical mass as applied to women’s representation in politics first appeared in the work of Drude Dahlerup (1988). Lovenduski and Azza Karam (2002, 2) note that Dahlerup’s studies of women MPs in Sweden showed the impact of a critical mass:\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 5\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n5\n\n“Women politicians worked to recruit other women, and developed new legislation and institutions to benefit women. As their numbers grew it became easier to be a woman politician and public perceptions of women politicians changed.” At the same time, others have suggested that even a critical mass of women legislators may not be enough.8 Citing the Kenyan, Ugandan, and South African cases, Hannah Britton (2005, 18) argues that many other factors may affect the ability for women to succeed in office, including patronage politics, patriarchal social norms, and social authoritarianism. Achieving a critical mass is not a panacea for undoing the imbalances of societal gender inequality. At the same time, as this book will demonstrate, there are clearly identifiable benefits of having a substantial number of women in elected office. In June 2000 the Women’s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), based in New York City, launched the 50/50 campaign, an effort to raise to 50 percent the level of women’s participation in politics and decisionmaking around the world. In launching the campaign WEDO organizers cited their reasons for joining the struggle for women’s increased political representation: “We recognize that numbers are a necessary but not sufficient condition for women’s full, equal, active and informed participation in economic, social and political decision-making. There is evidence, however, that when women enter decision-making bodies in significant numbers, such issues as child care, violence against women and unpaid labor are more likely to become priorities for policy-makers” (WEDO n.d.). More than a dozen countries have launched national 50/50 campaigns, including Namibia, South Africa, and Uganda. In those countries women activists are focused not only on the need for more women in politics but also on how to get them there.\n\nHow to Elect More Women to Parliament?\n\nAssuming women and men should be equally represented at all levels of politics and decisionmaking, the question remains: How should that equal representation be accomplished? Existing research identifies a number of key factors that have helped to bring more women into national legislatures. These include the manipulation of electoral systems (the use of particular types of electoral systems and gender-based electoral quotas), the ideological orientation of the major political parties and the pressure exerted upon them by national women’s movements,\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 6\n\n6\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nand social and cultural trends over time. Women candidates must also be available to stand for national political office. Electoral Systems\n\nThose countries that have historically had the highest representation of women in their national legislatures—Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark (with 45.3, 38.2, 37.5, and 36.9 percent women, respectively, in early 2005)—all use a proportional representation (PR) electoral system and (with the exception of Finland) some form of voluntary, partybased quota, now or in the past (Ballington 2004, 125). The type of electoral system and use of electoral quotas are particularly significant because, “unlike other strategies to increase the level of women’s legislative representation, such as changing political culture and the level of economic development . . . institutional structures are relatively easy to change” (Gray 2003, 55). As Matland (2002, 5) notes: “Changing the electoral system often represents a far more realistic goal to work towards than dramatically changing the culture’s view of women.” Electoral systems are key because the choice of system “maximizes or minimizes the ability of political parties to manipulate the slate of candidates” (Meintjes and Simons 2002, 167). In general it is considered that PR systems are more favorable toward women than plurality-majority systems or semiproportional systems.9 Julie Ballington (2004, 125) documents that in 2004 all but two of the fifteen countries with the highest rates of women’s representation in the world used a PR electoral system (and the fifteen countries with the lowest rates used pluralitymajority systems, averaging 1 percent of women in their legislatures). Staffan Lindberg (2004, 35), using a data set of 127 African elections held between 1989 and 2003, corroborates the general finding that “the more proportional the electoral system, the larger the share of the legislature that will be occupied by women.” Several reasons are given for women’s more favorable electoral outcomes under a PR than a plurality-majority electoral system. Most important, perhaps, is the fact that quotas are more easily implemented under a PR than a majoritarian system (Ballington 2004, 126). Another reason is that “contagion”—parties adopting the policies of other parties—is more likely to happen in PR systems than in majoritarian systems (Matland 2002, 7). At the same time, not all PR electoral systems are the same, and certain factors help to further enhance women’s representation (Matland 2002, 8–9). These include closed party lists, higher district magnitude, and high electoral thresholds. In a closed-list (as opposed to open-list)\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 7\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n7\n\nPR electoral system, the party determines the rank ordering of candidates on the party list, and women’s names cannot be removed from the list or moved downward by voters during an election, as experience has shown will happen with an open-list system. District magnitude refers to the number of seats per district. “As the number of seats per district increases, parties will go further down their lists (that is, win more seats) and more parties will have multi-member [presumably including more women] delegations.” The most advantageous system for women is one in which the entire country is one electoral district. Finally, higher electoral thresholds are seen to favor women; low thresholds, according to Matland, encourage the creation of many “mini-parties, which often let in only one or two representatives. Overwhelmingly parties tend to have male leaders and party leaders inevitably take the first few slots on the list.” Gender-Based Quotas\n\nGender-based electoral quotas are meant to bring more women into politics and may take various forms. Although “some consider quotas to be a form of discrimination and a violation of the principle of fairness . . . others view them as compensation for structural barriers that prevent fair competition” (Dahlerup 2004, 17). Today, according to Dahlerup (2002, 1), quota systems aim at ensuring that women constitute at least a critical minority of 30 or 40 percent. They are typically applied as a temporary measure, until the barriers to women’s entry into politics are removed. Quotas may be constitutional, as in Uganda and Rwanda; legislative, as in many parts of Latin America; or adopted by political parties, as in South Africa and Mozambique (Dahlerup 2004, 18). Uganda’s 1995 constitution provides for “reserved seats” for women—one parliamentary seat in each of the country’s districts is reserved for a woman. Provision is also made for other non-gender-specific reserved seats; women may run for these and other ordinary parliamentary seats in Uganda, and have done so successfully. In Latin America in the 1990s, eleven countries passed national laws requiring that at least 20 to 40 percent of candidates in national elections be women. Argentina has had the most success among these countries, utilizing a 30 percent quota in combination with a closed-list PR system to achieve a 31 percent representation of women in parliament (Gray 2003). Political party–based quotas were used in the past by social democratic parties in some of the Scandinavian countries. In 1983 the Norwegian Labour Party decided that “at all elections and nominations\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nboth sexes must be represented by at least 40 percent.” In 1994 Sweden’s Social Democratic Party took the more dramatic step of introducing the principle of “every second on the list a woman” for its party lists (Dahlerup 2002, 4). Parties in Southern Africa have dubbed such rosters “zebra lists”—men and women alternate like the black and white stripes of a zebra. Many observers have attributed Scandinavia’s high representation of women since the 1970s to the use of quotas. Dahlerup notes, however, that in Scandinavia quotas were never mandated by law and were adopted only at the level of the political party (and not all parties used them). Further, these party-based quotas were not introduced until women had already acquired around 25 percent of seats in parliament, a result of socioeconomic developments over time. Thus, Dahlerup (2004, 18) warns, “the Scandinavian experience cannot be considered a model for the 21st century because it took 80 years to get that far.” Today, by contrast, “the women of the world are not willing to wait that long,” so gender-based electoral quotas are being deployed with increasing frequency. Political Parties and Women’s Movements\n\nPolitical parties are the gatekeepers to women’s participation in politics because it is largely as candidates from particular parties that women stand for political office (Matland 2002). Ballington (2002, 77) identifies parties as “the final determinant of women’s presence or absence in political institutions and consequently in the public domain.” Moreover, in her late-1990s study of twelve advanced industrial countries, Miki Caul found that certain characteristics of political parties enhance the likelihood of women’s increased political representation. Caul (1999, 94) argues that “high levels of institutionalization, a localized level of candidate nomination, and leftist and postmaterialist values all individually enable parties to increase the representation of women.” Further, she contends that “high levels of women working at internal party offices and the presence of formal rules designed to increase the number of women MPs are both conducive to women’s representation.” Caul underscores the significance of women’s party activism in increasing women’s political representation. Such activism is crucial, she suggests, to the adoption of electoral and quota rules that will facilitate women’s greater political participation. Indeed, the importance of mobilized women’s movements and the pressure they exert upon political parties has been noted repeatedly. In Scandinavia, according to Dahlerup (2002, 4), it was sustained pressure\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 9\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n9\n\nfrom women’s groups within political parties and women’s movements more generally that resulted in the adoption of quotas by several political parties. Steven Saxonberg (2000, 154–155) argues that in post-transition Eastern Europe a lack of strong women’s movements has meant that the type of electoral system has had little impact on women’s representation. Without the ability to pressure political parties to nominate more women to winnable seats, women’s organizations stand little chance of increasing women’s representation in parliaments. The support of women’s movements has also been found to be crucial in ensuring that women legislators promote an agenda in which women’s issues are prominent (Bystydzienski 1992; Carroll 1992). Moreover, as Sylvia Tamale (2000, 14) notes, a strong women’s movement is particularly important in assuring that female legislators are aware of the strong need to “reconstruct political structures according to feminist principles.”\n\nElecting Women to Parliament in Africa\n\nIn those cases presented in this book in which women have gained substantial political representation over the last decade, the backdrop has been a political transition following a period of prolonged conflict. In Uganda in 1986, after a long guerrilla war, the National Resistance Movement (NRM) ousted the last in a series of dictators and assumed the reins of power. In 1990, after a twenty-five-year armed struggle led by the exiled South West Africa People’s Organisation (Swapo), Namibia gained its independence from seventy-five years of de facto South African colonial rule. In Mozambique in 1992 externally brokered negotiations finally brought an end to seventeen years of brutal civil war, and in 1994 the first multiparty elections retained the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) party in power. In South Africa in 1994 the venerable African National Congress (ANC) won the country’s first-ever universal franchise elections, marking the formal end of decades of apartheid rule and a decades-long armed struggle. Also in 1994 the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) proclaimed a new government after defeating the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) government whose supporters had fomented the genocide that had claimed the lives of nearly one million Rwandans. In Senegal a much less dramatic political transition has occurred, and not in the aftermath of a prolonged conflict—in 2000 Senegal’s ruling Socialist Party, in power since independence in 1960, was voted out of office, and in 2001 a new constitution was adopted.\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nThis set of transitions in six African countries is part of a larger set of transitions in Africa during the 1980s and 1990s from some form of authoritarian rule to a more democratic rule. This wave of transitions— part of the so-called third wave of democracy—has been referred to by some as Africa’s second liberation, with the period of independence being Africa’s first liberation. Indeed, in the 1960s, after nearly a century of European colonial rule, most African countries made the significant transition to political independence. In most cases, the transfer of power from the European colonial ruler to the newly independent African country was a relatively peaceful one. The exceptions tended to be the settler colonies, such as Algeria, where a devastating war was necessary to gain independence, or several countries in Southern Africa where independence was only attained in the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s, after decades of diplomatic and armed struggle. For a few of these countries, Africa’s second liberation was their first. In the 1960s, the political system of the departing colonial power was typically adopted wholesale by the newly independent African country. In the former English (Anglophone) colonies the Westminster parliamentary model, with a prime minister and fused executive and legislative powers, was taken on, while the former French (Francophone) colonies embraced the French model of a president-centered system in which the executive and legislative branches were separate. A first round of universal franchise elections brought nationalist movements to power and filled the seats of national legislatures with eager members. In every independent African country women were given the vote, along with men, at independence, and in many countries women’s participation in nationalist movements was rewarded with the establishment of national machineries for women and national women’s organizations. But hopes for further advances were quickly dashed. By 1964 roughly two-thirds of independent African states had become one-party states. By 1970 about seventy coups or coup attempts had occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, and about one-half of then independent countries were under military rule. In the turn to single-party or military rule, constitutions were abandoned, political parties (except the ruling ones) proscribed, and civil society organizations banned. Most parliaments fell silent or became mere rubberstamping bodies for the party in power. For women the only space for organizing was within an official wing of the ruling party or the national women’s association, typically headed by the president’s wife.10 A few token women may have occupied the occasional seat in parliament or cabinet, but the most common role for party women was praise singing and dancing at official functions and ceremonies.\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 11\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n11\n\nWhat then distinguishes the current spate of transitions, from which African women appear to have gained far more, from the transitions to independence in the 1960s? A number of factors are identified in the country cases that follow. First, as we noted before, the most significant advances have been made in postconflict states. Indeed, it appears that the disruptions to gender relations caused by prolonged conflict may actually offer opportunities for reconfiguring those relations in the postconflict period. Moreover, it appears that prolonged conflicts have produced a second factor, namely, a cadre of capable women willing and able to run for political office. Many of these women fought alongside their male counterparts during wars of liberation and/or had critical education and training opportunities overseas during years living in exile. Other women became activists at home struggling against an oppressive or dictatorial rule. Third, women and their organizations, emboldened by their experiences of struggle and learning at home and abroad, inserted themselves into the processes of crafting new constitutions and drafting new laws during the political transitions. New constitutions and new laws have, in turn, provided the legal foundations and political frameworks for the institutions and mechanisms to bring more women into political office. Critical to this process has been a fourth factor, namely, women’s organizations and movements and the pressure that they have exerted on political parties to adopt the strategies and mechanisms that have led to women’s increased representation in politics. Fifth, a global women’s movement, to which many African women have been exposed in the course of conflict, has played a large role. African women have participated actively in and been strongly influenced by international forums such as the United Nations conferences on women.11 Postconflict States\n\nIn recent years it has been argued that violent conflict, which results in major disruptions to gender relations, can also provide “new opportunities to articulate debate about gender politics as well as for individual women to live in a different way.” This is said to be all the more true when liberation movements have been part of that conflict (Pankhurst 2002, 127). Citing the examples of Uganda and some Southern African countries, Donna Pankhurst (2002, 123) suggests that violent conflict has offered significant opportunities for changes in gender relations in a number of African countries. Whether women took up arms from outside the country or took on male roles at home while men were “fighting, in\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nprison, or dead,” profound changes in gender relations ensued in the rural and urban areas as people called into question the need for rigid roles. Although the potential for backlash is great during the postconflict period, Pankhurst (2002, 124) argues that where liberation movements with some previously stated commitment to gender equality came into power, political space in which women could act opened. Indeed, Pankhurst suggests that access to this space, coupled with the “relatively new types of democracy introduced during the 1990s,” allowed women to enter formal politics in increasing numbers and with increasing effectiveness. The case studies in this book largely confirm Pankhurst’s observations about a connection between postconflict states and improvements in women’s political representation. Available Women Candidates\n\nThe conflict situations experienced in many of the countries discussed in this book seem to have resulted in an available cadre of women who have been involved in politics in one way or another for decades. Indeed, women in many of these countries have had experiences and opportunities not typical of the majority of African women. In Namibia and South Africa, for example, a significant portion of current women MPs spent many years in exile as members of Swapo and the ANC, respectively. In exile Namibian and South African women obtained training and education to which they never would have had access at home, with the result that many women MPs are highly skilled and educated. At the same time, many Namibian and South African women MPs joined their respective struggles as community organizers and antiapartheid activists fighting the wars at home. These women too have brought to national politics a unique and valuable set of skills gained during years of grassroots activity. Similarly, in Mozambique women participated as combatants and in other roles in the armed insurrection against the Portuguese that was required to attain independence. The Marxist-Leninist Frelimo movement incorporated women in various guises into the liberation struggle and included women’s emancipation as one of its stated goals. This did not translate, in the postindependence period, into parliamentary gains for women. But, as Jennifer Disney argues in this volume, some of the impetus for women’s legislative gains after the end of war in 1992 stems from this legacy. In Rwanda women contributed to an emerging, thriving civil society in the 1980s and 1990s as they organized in response to deteriorating economic conditions and resulting growing social needs. As a result\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 13\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n13\n\nof the genocide in 1994, according to Timothy Longman, many of these same women’s organizations were devastated when their leaders were killed or forced into exile. At the same time, importantly, the intense problems facing women in the postconflict period inspired many of these same women’s organizations to assume important social roles. These groups’ growing public influence then translated into concrete political power. Women moved directly from positions in civil society organizations to positions in government. In so doing, they also promoted the importance and legitimacy of women holding office. Electoral Systems and Gender-based Quotas\n\nOne of the most significant opportunities to alter gender relations and to increase women’s representation in legislatures has occurred during the post-transition period as new constitutions and laws have been written and new institutions created. Indeed, every country discussed in this book has adopted a new constitution since 1985, although the most prominent gains for women have been in the postconflict countries. South Africa provides the clearest example of women coming together with the express purpose of influencing the constitution and the posttransition political and legal framework. In 1991 women returning from exile and those from women’s groups inside the country joined together to form the Women’s National Coalition (WNC), a coalition of more than 100 women’s groups, including representatives of all of the major political parties. The coalition then drew up the Women’s Charter, one of the key goals of which was to advance women’s equality in the constitution. In addition, the WNC lobbied for the creation of a Gender Advisory Committee to the (all-male) body negotiating the transition and new constitution. In part because of these efforts, Britton argues, the South African constitution has one of the broadest and most inclusive constitutional equality clauses in the world. Similarly, in Namibia in 1989 the six women members of the Constituent Assembly worked hard to shape a progressive constitution for that country, one that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex (and several other attributes), notes the special discrimination suffered by women in the past and the need to redress it with affirmative action, and states that customary law may remain in effect but only when it does not conflict with the constitution or other laws. More important, perhaps, to the election of women to parliament is the choice of electoral system and use of gender-based quotas. Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, and South Africa all utilize a closed-list pro-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 14\n\n14\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nportional representation electoral system for their parliamentary elections. Moreover, in each case the PR system is used in conjunction with some form of mandatory or voluntary gender-based quota. Uganda utilizes a majoritarian (“first-past-the-post”) electoral system in combination with reserved seats for women. In South Africa, again under pressure from the WNC, the ANC instituted a 30 percent quota for women candidates on its party list in 1994 and for the 1999 and 2004 elections moved to a system by which every third position on the party’s candidate list was occupied by a woman. Other parties also worked to increase female representation on their lists. In Mozambique since 1999 Frelimo policy requires that 30 percent of the party’s candidates for the national legislature be women. Party policy also commits (though it does not require) the party to balance the distribution of women throughout the list, rather than grouping them all at the end. By contrast, the opposition party Renamo has no quota for women and no women’s wing. In Namibia women activists have called on political parties to utilize zebra lists for national legislative elections. In the 1999 and 2004 elections close to 30 percent of names on the major party lists for the National Assembly were women. At the local level in Namibia such quotas are mandated by law. Rwanda and Uganda use a slightly different system, but with a similar effect. In these two countries reserved seats for women in the national legislature have been introduced, in Uganda in 1989 and Rwanda in 2003. In Uganda one seat in the parliament is reserved for a woman in each of the country’s fifty-six districts. In Rwanda 30 percent of seats in the Chamber of Deputies are reserved for women, allocated in such a manner that two women are sent from each of the provinces and two from the city of Kigali. In both cases, moreover, women have been elected to the national legislatures from more than just the reserved seats. In Uganda in 2001, 56 women won reserved seats for women in the districts; 13 won open constituency seats; and 6 won youth, labor, and disability reserved seats. In Rwanda in 2003, women were elected to 24 reserved seats and an additional 15 seats (out of 80). In neither case, then, have reserved seats represented a cap on women’s election to national office. Furthermore, as Tripp and Longman point out, in both countries women have been elected to and selected for many other offices, such as judges and magistrates. In Senegal, with 19 percent women in its National Assembly since 2001, a mixed electoral system is utilized for national legislative elections, with the proportion of PR versus plurality seats changing from one election to another. Lucy Creevey concludes that, by and large, the PR system does favor women more than the plurality system. More-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 15\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n15\n\nover, since 2002 several political parties in Senegal have agreed to a 30 percent quota for their candidate lists, although the Democratic Socialist Party, with the most women MPs in the National Assembly, does not use a gender-based quota. Pressure from National Women’s Organizations on Political Parties\n\nAs in other parts of the world, political parties and women’s organizations play a tremendous part in electing women to national political office in Africa. Goetz and Hassim (2003, 10) note that despite a “feminist antipathy to parties” in many developing countries, there has typically been little choice but for women’s movements to work with political parties, especially in Africa. In general two factors have challenged women’s successful interaction with political parties in Africa. First, in those cases where nationalist or liberation movements became ruling parties, women’s secondary status in the movements was replicated in the parties. Moreover, dominant parties also heavily curtailed civil society activity that could provide an alternative venue for women and their organizations. Second, because so many parties are so poorly institutionalized, lacking strong rules and procedures, challenging party practices can be difficult (Goetz and Hassim 2003, 10–11). To a certain extent, political transitions in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s have improved the prospects for women’s interaction with political parties. Indeed, the cases in this volume suggest that the role of parties remains paramount to women’s election to national legislatures, particularly in those countries using PR electoral systems. For example, in Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique, quotas have been adopted by political parties rather than mandated by national law. Indeed, political parties have been targeted by women activists and organizations keen to increase women’s representation. In Rwanda and Uganda ruling parties or movements have institutionalized the reserved seats for women, though clearly pressured to do so by women’s groups. It could be argued that all five of these parties are left-leaning, thereby verifying the assertion of many that such parties, as in Scandinavia, are more likely to help raise women’s political participation. Finally, it has been hypothesized that the larger the share of the vote for the main political party, the more women in the legislature (Matland and Taylor 1997), and our cases appear to corroborate this assertion. In addition, as elsewhere, pressure from women’s organizations and movements on political parties and leaders has been critical to increasing women’s representation. Aili Mari Tripp (2001a) early on identified the rise of independent women’s organizations in Africa as one of the factors\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\naccounting for women’s increased visibility as independent political actors across the continent in the 1990s. In her chapter on Uganda she notes that key leaders of the Ugandan women’s movement visited Yoweri Museveni shortly after the NRM took power in 1986 to press for women’s greater representation in government leadership, with immediate success. With the opening of political space in Uganda in the mid-1980s, Tripp continues, there was an extraordinary growth in the influence of women’s movements, aided by increased educational opportunities for women that gave rise to stronger female leadership. Women’s groups mobilized around a range of issues and pressed to improve leadership skills, encourage political involvement, advocate for political leadership, and more advances for women. In Rwanda, Longman notes, women’s organizations stepped in to fill a social void in the postgenocide period. One group in particular, the umbrella organization Pro-Femmes, took the lead in lobbying the government on a series of women’s issues, winning concessions from the executive and legislature. Longman argues that this extensive involvement of Rwandan women in civil society led directly to their increased presence in the national legislature. In Namibia and South Africa women’s organizations are clearly central to women’s presence in politics today. We have noted the role of the WNC in establishing a favorable constitutional and electoral framework for women in South Africa. In Namibia women and their organizations have united around the goal of increasing women’s national political representation. Indeed, after decades of party-political, racial, socioeconomic, and rural/urban divisions, women have mobilized around this issue. Moreover, there is significant interaction between women’s organizations and the women who are being elected to office. As Disney observes for Mozambique, it is often the same women who are moving in and out of leadership roles in government and civil society. In Senegal, where women MPs lag behind their Eastern and Southern African counterparts, increasing women’s legislative representation is not high on the agenda of women’s groups, according to Creevey. Rather, women are concerned about issues such as domestic violence, female circumcision, and equalizing economic opportunities. Moreover, so long as the National Assembly remains not much more than an “audience” for the decrees of the executive, it will not be much of a priority for Senegalese women, Creevey contends. Influence of a Global Women’s Movement\n\nThough it is important to acknowledge the diversity of African feminisms and the ways in which they differ from other feminisms (Mikell\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 17\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n17\n\n1997; Oyewumi 1997, 2003), it is also the case that women’s organizations and movements in Africa have been profoundly influenced by a global women’s movement. Decades in exile exposed some Namibian and South African activists to a diversity of feminist organizations, publications, thought, and activity. When they returned to Namibia and South Africa in 1989 and the early 1990s, the onetime exiles brought those influences with them. Britton notes the importance of political learning. She relates that women activists in political parties in South Africa, in contemplating the electoral framework for a new South Africa, were acutely aware of what had and had not worked for women in politics elsewhere on the continent. As Tripp and Gretchen Bauer indicate for Uganda and Namibia, meetings such as the United Nations conferences on women, particularly those in Nairobi (1985) and Beijing (1995), gave added impetus to national women’s organizations as they sought to convince governments to adopt national gender policies and institutionalize national machineries for women. Many individual women MPs and activists spoke of the transformative impact that attending such conferences had on them, inspiring them to redouble their efforts at home. Donor agencies have also had a significant influence; as Tripp notes for Uganda, changing donor strategies that emphasize nongovernmental activities to a greater extent than in the past have also contributed to the extraordinary growth in women’s political participation and representation. In Senegal, according to Creevey, it was the US-based National Democratic Institute that persuaded some political parties there to adopt gender quotas in 2002. In Southern Africa, regional organizations have also played an important role. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Gender Unit spearheaded an (unsuccessful) campaign to have 30 percent of positions of power and decisionmaking held by women by 2005 and gained pledges of support from political leaders throughout the region. In 2002 the SADC Parliamentary Forum launched a regional women’s parliamentary caucus, meant to provide support for the growing number of women parliamentarians in Southern Africa. In East Africa, regional influences have played a role as well. For Rwanda, Longman notes the clear influence of developments in neighboring Uganda (where many Rwandans spent decades in exile) on politics for women in Rwanda.\n\nImpact and Experiences of Women in Parliament in Africa\n\nFaced with a similar postcolonial framework—marked by issues of land rights, resource control, economic poverty, population growth, and in-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 18\n\n18\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nternal conflict—autonomy, sovereignty, transparency, and democracy have become paramount for African MPs. Women MPs have the additional test of working against the impact of contemporary power patriarchies that are infused with the legacies of colonial economic, social, and religious patterns. Because colonialism served to undermine African women’s status in society and restricted them to the domestic, private sphere (Amadiume 1997; Gordon 1996; Guy 1990), many women MPs have had to work not only to master the substance of their jobs as legislators but also to legitimize their presence in parliaments. African women MPs, perhaps even more than their counterparts in Europe and the West, have to work to define themselves as vital participants in the public space of elected office. There is a deep commitment on the part of women leaders in Africa to improving the overall quality of life for women in their countries. It is from the backdrop of struggle that women are entering parliaments in Africa in significant numbers. Most African women MPs are finding parliaments to be new landscapes of struggle and are working to define new forms of agency and activism within their institutions with varied success. All are making visible changes in the political lives of their countries. Some women MPs’ impact is felt within the institutional culture of parliament itself. Others’ impact may be seen within their legislative goals and outcomes. And still others’ impact is increasingly visible in new ways of organizing with women and organizations in civil society. Impact on Institutional Culture\n\nAfrican women MPs have made varied but consistent changes to their parliamentary cultures. In cases where there has been a rapid influx of women into office, the physical presence of large numbers of women has had a visible impact on the institution of parliament. Rudimentary logistical accommodations often had to be made for women, such as building more lavatories for the large number of women elected in South Africa in 1994 who would otherwise have had to share the one facility in the parliament building. Women MPs across the continent have also begun to push for changes in the structure of parliamentary life to recognize that women have to balance domestic and professional responsibilities. They have demanded on-site child care facilities for MPs and staff, changed the hours of parliamentary work to end earlier, and changed the parliamentary calendar to match school holidays. Most important, the presence of a large number of women MPs has changed cultural and societal perceptions about the nature of political\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 19\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n19\n\nleadership and governance. In Namibia, Mozambique, Uganda, South Africa, and Rwanda, as women entered the halls of parliaments, they too became faces and names associated with national office and legislation. Their presence and their success challenged the traditional perceptions of women as subordinates and men as leaders. And, as women’s political participation becomes routine and legitimized, their absence from committees and delegations is rapidly becoming unacceptable. This normalization creates a positive environment for the active recruitment, advancement, and mentoring of younger women. What remains to be seen is how these newer generations of women MPs will differ from their mentors who first broke through the glass ceilings. Throughout the continent, African women MPs have striven to create state institutions for the advancement of feminist change as part of long-term strategies for improving the quality of life for women in their nations. African women MPs recognize that their time in office is often short-lived and that state institutions are the key to ensuring that their goals and ideas become permanent features of government. Rather than demonizing the state as an entity of oppression, women are increasingly moving from resisting the state to using the state. Elisabeth Friedman (2000) estimates that over 90 percent of countries have some form of “state feminism,” meaning that at least one national agency for women, such as a women’s ministry, department, or commission, exists. The increasing reliance upon the state for feminist change in developed nations (Stetson and Mazur 1995) has had a clear impact on the turn toward the state by women in developing nations (Staudt 1998; Friedman 2000; Baldez 2001). This is also the emerging trend in Africa, even though it is widely recognized that the state has also been a source of African women’s disempowerment (Parpart and Staudt 1989). Having now obtained positions of power in the institutions that previously oppressed them, African women MPs are turning that power on its head and are creating national state agencies to improve the status of women and to ensure that their basic needs are met. The range of state institutions favored by African women MPs varies from legislative committees and parliamentary women’s caucuses to government departments, women’s ministries, national gender commissions, and women’s budgets. For example, Namibia has a Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare to oversee national gender policy and a Women and Law Committee to help draft new laws. South Africa has an Office on the Status of Women in the executive, a Commission for Gender Equality and a Women’s Budget Initiative that involve both civil society and government agencies, and a Joint Monitor-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\ning Committee on the Improvement of the Quality of Life and Status of Women in parliament. In Rwanda the Forum of Women Parliamentarians has been instrumental in examining gendered aspects of new legislation, and in Uganda the Women Parliamentary Association has taken an active role in legislative debates on gender issues. In almost all cases, some level of institutionalization has been essential for the creation, implementation, and monitoring of government commitments to gender issues. Impact on Legislation\n\nIn addition to their work to create national machineries for women, African women MPs have made remarkable progress in shaping the legislative agendas of their nations. Although parliaments vary in the number of women members, it is clear that women’s activism within parliament has fostered an emphasis on addressing both the practical and strategic needs of women in their societies. In fact, much of the legislative work of African women MPs serves to collapse the distinction between Maxine Molyneux’s (1985) practical needs and strategic needs.12 For many African women, practical needs are in fact strategic needs. Women’s access to strategic needs is the only way to ensure the security of their practical needs. As the cases in this book show, legislative agendas across Africa demonstrate this idea as lived practice. African women MPs have an agenda that is demonstrably broader than the legislative platforms of their counterparts in the North. Women MPs across the continent have introduced gender into legislative debates and outcomes, forcing national legislatures to recognize the differential impact of policies on women and men. For example, the legislative agendas of many African parliaments are focused on land rights, and women MPs are challenging their male counterparts to include the issue of gender within the discussion of land rights and the context of customary law. Similarly, poverty alleviation is central to the platform of parliaments across the continent, and women MPs are beginning to push programs that recognize women’s economic roles and include them in the benefits of training and resource allocation. Women MPs are examining the gendered aspects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They are attempting to find creative approaches that empower women to maintain or gain control over their sexual activity, they are envisioning policies to accommodate the growing number of childheaded households, and they are evaluating the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the disease as well as outline the conditions for ad-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 21\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n21\n\nequate treatment and care. Finally, though violence against women has been utilized by colonial and more recent authoritarian regimes to maintain control over populations, discussion of the scope and nature of this violence has too often been absent in public dialogue. As women enter the halls of parliament across Africa, this violence is being named and strategies for its eradication are being devised. The impact of women MPs on legislation is clearly evident in the cases in this volume. For Mozambique Disney uses the lens of the new family law to delineate the transformation of government attitudes toward the construction of “the family” and its subsequent meanings, to evaluate the changes in status and power of women within Mozambican culture, and to examine the new forms of interaction between women members of parliament and civil society organizations focused on women’s rights. Disney asserts that in their revision of the family law, women MPs were able to work in concert with women in civil society to foster an exceptionally progressive version of the family law. Writing about South Africa, Britton discusses multiple examples of how women MPs have influenced the initiation, drafting, or implementation of legislation. Women MPs have been involved in legislation dealing with abortion, pornography, employment equity, skills development, labor relations, basic income grants and maintenance, and domestic violence. Women legislators in South Africa have taken their role in the legislative process seriously and have had increasing effectiveness in terms of influencing the direction and scope of their parties’ agendas. In Namibia, Bauer finds that women MPs claim credit for a range of legislative initiatives and accomplishments. Indeed, the country’s first women legislators, though few in number, maintain that they played a significant role in crafting the country’s progressive constitution. One of those same women MPs was instrumental in the adoption of a mandatory gender quota for local-level elections. Namibian women MPs have worked to dismantle the apartheid-era legislation that discriminated against women and to foster legislation to assist in the economic and social development of women and girls. Women MPs have worked to engender legislation on affirmative action and labor relations, equality in marriage, land rights, gender violence, domestic violence, and child maintenance. Yet, as the case of Uganda demonstrates, merely bringing women into national office does not necessarily translate into a consistent voice for women’s rights. There is no question that women in the Ugandan parliament have had some fairly positive input into legislative debates.\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 22\n\n22\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nBut, as Tripp discusses in this volume, their record is uneven. Women legislators have worked to introduce or reform laws concerning gender violence and land rights, and they have been involved in debates concerning the regulation of bride price, marriage, and polygamy. But they have often been pressured by the ruling National Resistance Movement. For example, Tripp discusses the negotiations over the 1998 Land Act, in which women MPs and women’s rights advocates were able to secure several provisions for the protection of women’s land rights. However, a vital co-ownership clause was omitted against the wishes and lobbying activities of civil society organizations, and the NRM leaned heavily on women MPs to vote against the amendments. This example is essential for a fair assessment of the limitations of women legislators to challenge party leadership, especially when their political survival is dependent upon the approval of those leaders. Similar patterns can be found throughout this volume of women legislators finding themselves thwarted by the power of patronage, the traditions of parliamentary politics, and the demands of party leadership. One of the biggest problems facing women legislators continues to be policy implementation. As Bauer concludes, the framework for women’s equality has been enshrined in the new legislation and political institutions of postliberation Namibia, but the long-term challenge is the implementation of that framework. Here Bauer develops a key theme found throughout the book—that legislating policy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ensuring the adequate implementation of policies to advance the status and position of women. Just as important is the risk that women’s legislative representation may be used by political leaders and parties to legitimize their agendas. This is seen most clearly in the Rwandan case. For example, Rwandan women legislators have been visible in the legislative arena. Through the work of the Forum of Women Parliamentarians, women legislators have contributed to debates on gender violence, inheritance rights, and gender discrimination. However, their actions are always governed by the agendas of their respective parties. As elsewhere in Africa, women legislators in Rwanda are constrained by the partisan nature of parliamentary politics because their political survival depends on their political parties. As the government in Rwanda has become even more authoritarian, the intolerance of dissent has led to a broader political intolerance and in some cases repression. Rwandan women legislators therefore find themselves facilitating policies that strengthen an authoritarian state and undermine individual civil liberties. Much as in the Ugandan case, Longman raises important questions about women in of-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 23\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n23\n\nfice doing more to legitimize and support the ruling party than to foster the gendered agenda many had intended. Senegal extends this discussion by examining the ways women have been blocked from full participation in politics. Senegal is not an Islamic state governed by fundamentalists, but Senegalese politics are increasingly influenced by transnational Islamic attitudes. The convergence of religion and culture has served to reinforce notions that women ought not be part of formal politics, even though Senegalese women have more freedom and access to education and employment than women in many parts of the Middle East. As in Uganda and Rwanda, another obstacle blocking women in politics is the semiauthoritarian, highly centralized power of the executive that discourages full democratic participation regardless of gender. As Creevey notes in her conclusion, electing more women to parliament will not be a priority for women activists in Senegal until the National Assembly becomes a more autonomous body, not simply a rubber stamp for the executive. Impact on Civil Society\n\nExamining post-transition politics in Latin America and Eastern Europe, Georgina Waylen (1994) notes the chasm that often develops between women in office and women in civil society after a political transition. Because of the new institutional norms and values faced by women legislators who now have to answer to political party leaders and their constituents, women MPs and legislators often find themselves at cross-purposes with women’s movements and organizations in civil society. As time passes, the usual tension between women in office and their female constituents frequently presents itself. Gender activists and women’s organizations may find themselves walking a thin line between cooperation with the government and co-optation by the government. Women’s organizations have often been some of the first groups to call for increased transparency, decreased corruption, and increased accountability in government. Although their legislative and political agendas closely resemble those of their civil society counterparts, African women MPs are not immune to this division. As the cases in this volume indicate, a gap between women MPs and women activists can be found throughout Africa. Just as women MPs voice concerns about their political survival in office, so do women activists voice concerns that they have been abandoned by their MP counterparts who are interested only in selfpreservation and self-promotion. There are often widely held attitudes\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nthat women MPs have been seduced by the power and once-in-alifetime financial security afforded by their positions. Despite this schism, there is evidence that many African women MPs turn to and rely upon their civil society counterparts, and vice versa. Perhaps as a result of bonds formed among women during liberation struggles, many of the women described in this book maintained the hope that postliberation governments would be more open, transparent, and progressive than the oppressive regimes they replaced. These expectations are not unfounded. There are clear signs that women’s groups should be more hopeful about the outcomes of parliaments that have high percentages of women members, based on the global experience of the legislative agendas and national machineries created by those parliaments. Disney finds that autonomous women’s organizations working specifically for the advancement of women were fairly circumscribed until the 1990s in Mozambique, and authentically progressive legislation protecting the rights of women, especially within the family, was limited at best. The transition from a Marxist-Leninist, one-party state to a neoliberal, multiparty state changed the nature of women’s political mobilization, organizations, and participation. Prior to the 1990s women operated within party structures to support and foster the attainment of party goals and agendas. Once the transition to multiparty democracy created more political space, women were able to operate outside political parties in their own organizations and movements and focus on self-identified gendered goals. In this way the Mozambican case establishes a pattern seen within many of the countries in the text: Women’s participation is only as viable as the political institutions and democratic processes within which they operate. Unlike in Mozambique, where the previous one-party rule did not necessarily translate into women in office, Tripp presents the conditional assessment that Museveni’s early one-party state fostered women’s advancement because he could unilaterally adopt affirmative action measures such as the reserved seats that provided women with the political training and national exposure that would foster acceptance of them as political actors. Concurrently, women’s organizations were working from the bottom up to strengthen women’s power and status in Ugandan society by increasing their access to education and social benefits that would create the next batch of women politicians, leaders, and activists. These organizations began to address women’s rights and heretofore hidden or unmentionable issues, such as gender violence, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and female genital\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 25\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n25\n\ncutting. Despite the potential for cooperation between women in office and women in civil society, Tripp notes the structural limitations placed on women in national office, who were in their positions in part because of Museveni’s patronage. This limited women office holders from building sustained coalitions with the women’s movement and from advancing a progressive legislative agenda on behalf of those groups. Tripp questions whether women in office may have done more to support Museveni and his regime than to support the gender issues that propelled many of them into office. As in Mozambique, Britton finds that in South Africa women were initially focused on drafting legislation to improve women’s position nationally. Women MPs also worked with gender consultants to design a set of institutions that would bring gender issues, and hopefully gender consciousness, into the mainstream throughout all branches of government. Despite the visible and notable progress toward gender equity in South Africa, there remain institutional obstacles for women in parliament as well as cultural norms that often hinder their full participation. This situation has contributed to a growing tension and lack of communication between women MPs and women in civil society. In Namibia women have historically had little success in developing an enduring national women’s organization, but they do have a legacy of civil society organizations that fostered a range of social and economic development initiatives. As Bauer writes in this volume, during the transition process this legacy was critical to fostering an attitude of acceptance of women’s rightful place in political life. It has also assisted in the enactment of progressive legislation, much of which will benefit women’s long-term status and development. Bauer has also found evidence of a growing mobilization of women activists and organizations seeking to elect more women to political office. Although this effort predated the international 50/50 campaign, Namibia has since joined that global campaign for women’s increased representation. These findings are vital for understanding the potential for transnational feminist movements in Africa. Groups from throughout Africa have joined the movement to have 50 percent of elected offices held by women. The momentum for this campaign has spread rapidly across borders, and it is often a combined effort of gender activists and women politicians. Perhaps the most active support for the campaign has come in countries that already have a demonstrable level of women in office, such as Namibia and South Africa, indicating that success breeds success. Organizations in those countries can point to the impact of women in office as well as the international goodwill that often follows such\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nsuccess. But there is also the issue of timing. As high percentages of women in office become the norm and not the exception, nations that seek to follow suit will have precedents to follow. Longman finds that women’s groups were fundamental in the development of Rwandan civil society in the 1980s and 1990s and worked especially to assist grassroots economic development. These groups and women leaders expanded the focus on social services and development to push for democratic reform and political representation. The Rwandan story has the additional and tragic legacy of the 1994 genocide and its aftermath that also contributed to the now record levels of women’s participation. After the genocide the entire institutional and social fabric had to be rewoven, and women’s organizations were often in the best position to do this based on their earlier developmental activities (despite the fact that many of their leaders had been killed or exiled). Longman asserts that a key factor prompting women to run for office was the commitment on the part of the postgenocidal leaders in Rwanda to include women in political life. These leaders benefited from the timing of the transition because Rwanda could learn from Mozambique, Uganda, Namibia, and South Africa. Rwanda in many ways represents a process of collective social learning and crossnational feminism. Creevey examines the role of women’s organizations in Senegalese politics and finds that women’s organizations in Senegal face the dual constraint of being elite-driven, thus lacking widespread support, and being influenced by the complexities of a growing anti-Western ideology. Women’s groups must therefore craft their calls for political leadership and power in ways that do not appear influenced by Western feminism and that do not directly threaten the status quo. Political leaders have supported, at least marginally, organizations and leaders that successfully manage to negotiate this political quicksand. Despite these constraints, Creevey presents evidence that the number of women in legislative office continues to grow, albeit slowly, as does the number of women ministers and leaders in government. The path may be more delicate for Senegalese women, but Creevey finds that there is room for growth.\n\nLessons Learned and Challenges Ahead\n\nThe cases in this text contain the voices of African women who explain in their own words how they have achieved or continue to fight for elec-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 27\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n27\n\ntoral success, how they have learned to work with lifelong adversaries, and how they have begun to transform their parliaments in order to create space for women’s issues to come to the fore. In many of the cases presented here, women and their organizations have seized the opportunities provided by their participation in decades-long conflicts and the transitions that accompanied the resolution of those conflicts. These cases demonstrate that, unlike many similar situations around the world, collaboration across class, ethnic, religious, or party lines is possible and may be successful given the right conditions. During times of national political transformation, for example, women may be able to secure significant gains by developing a broad, flexible coalition that allows for group differences. Such coalitions seem to function best when there is a shared identity of subordination and/or a shared belief in the necessity of group mobilization. National women’s movements in the cases presented in this volume have benefited from a growing collaboration with women’s groups globally, for example, at international fora such as the United Nations conferences on women. African women activists and legislators have learned from the experiences of national movements for women’s representation in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. They are members of international organizations and regularly exchange ideas with their sisters around the world. This text outlines women’s domestic strategies but also highlights their links to international women’s movements and organizations for gender equity. The successes of African women MPs have been notable in many of these cases, especially those falling within the top twenty-five countries internationally. These leaders have been able to transform parliaments as well as shift legislative priorities to reflect the needs and interests of women in their nations. At the same time, many women MPs find that despite their increased numerical representation, they continue to face disproportionate challenges that deter their effective or equitable participation. These include, at least initially, lack of appropriate skills and training, even language barriers, continued lack of respect and collaboration from some male members of parliament, lack of constituencies beyond those provided by their political parties, and lack of independent funding and patronage sources. The cases in this book reaffirm the growing comparative findings that electoral strategies, especially gender quotas, are often the most immediate and successful tools for increasing the number of women in national office. However, the African cases also reveal that relying on such quotas can be a double-edged sword. Depending on how the quo-\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 28\n\n28\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\ntas are constructed, women elected to reserved seats or who are indebted to party patronage systems often find their voices thwarted by party loyalty. As we see in a few of our cases, one impact of strategies such as quotas may be to support undemocratic movements, regimes, or processes rather than to promote progressive or gender-sensitive legislation and institutions. Another potential negative consequence of more women in parliament is the often unanticipated loss of women leaders from civil society organizations. As women across Africa have been pulled into the halls of parliament, they often leave women’s organizations and gender advocacy groups without a second tier of leaders in place. Thus, while getting women into office is a vital part of a national strategy for women’s empowerment, it is also important to maintain the strength of civil society groups. Ensuring smooth and consistent cooperation between women in civil society and women in office is also a long-term challenge. Given the professional and political constraints, women in office are often unable or unwilling to maintain strong links to civil society groups. Once women in these groups recognize the limitations of working with women MPs, their collaboration often falters. This is perhaps one of the most poignant lessons of this book, since it was often such collaboration that brought women into office in the first place. The cases in this book also remind us of the absolute necessity of sustaining democratic transitions, indeed of consolidating democracy, in order to assure women’s continued electoral successes. We have noted the way in which the global diffusion of multiparty politics has paved the way for women’s greater political participation and representation. By the same token, maintaining and deepening the institutions of political democracy will be essential to preserving women’s political gains. Otherwise, as happened in Zimbabwe, those gains will be undone.13 The Rwandan chapter in this volume warns of the dangers of incomplete transitions and potential democratic reversals to women’s national-level political gains. The cases in this volume are only a sample of the many stories of women across the African continent who have struggled and continue to strive for electoral reform, political representation, legislative change, and institutional transformation. Although these cases are representative of the successes and challenges of women in African parliaments, there are countless other stories that could and hopefully will be told about how issues of gender are infusing contemporary African politics. It is our intention that this book be part of the continentwide movement for increased women’s representation, which in turn is part of the global movement for\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 29\n\nA Continental Shift?\n\n29\n\npolitical office. We hope our book will contribute to this process by outlining multiple strategies of success pursued by African women as well as highlighting some of the institutional and cultural obstacles that continue to challenge women’s representation and hamper their legislative impact. The lessons African women in parliament can teach each other, as well as the world, are invaluable for a truly comparative understanding of how social movements influence electoral politics, how gender may be included in the mainstream of legislative debates and outcomes, and how groups may find unity and strength within a shared identity.\n\nNotes 1. National legislatures may be unicameral or bicameral. The crossnational comparisons of women in national legislatures, such as those maintained by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), typically cite women’s representation in the single or lower house of the national legislature. 2. www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm. 3. In 2001 women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were 15 million of the 18 million women living with HIV/AIDS in the developing world. SSA women experience a fertility rate of 5.4 children per woman in 2000–2005, compared to 2.5 and 3.3 children for women in Latin America and the Caribbean and South Asia, respectively. The adult literacy rate for women in SSA also lagged behind that of East Asian and Latin American women in 2001 (54 percent versus 81 and 88 percent, respectively), though it was better than the rate for South Asian women (45 percent). www.hdr.org. 4. As of April 30, 2005, Senegal was forty-eighth worldwide, with 19.2 percent women in its National Assembly, still relatively far ahead of the bulk of African countries. The regional average for Africa was 15 percent in a single or lower house and 14.2 percent in a senate or upper house. www.ipu.org/ wmn-e/classif.htm. 5. A vast literature spanning decades of research covers women in politics, including women legislators, primarily from developed countries. Some of that literature is cited in this book. 6. Two other recent studies (Geisler 2004; Morna 2004) focus on women in politics in Southern Africa, including but not limited to women legislators. Ballington (2004) focuses on quotas as mechanisms for electing more women to African parliaments. 7. Matland and Taylor (1997) and Goetz and Hassim (2003, 28) refer to Pitkin’s (1967) distinction between “standing for” a particular group “as their literal biological copies in public” and “acting for or in the interests of a particular group” as the difference between descriptive and substantive representation. Hyland Byrne (1997) refers to a difference between quantitative and qualitative representation.\n\n01_Chap01.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 30\n\n30\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\n8. The application of the critical-mass concept to women’s legislative representation has come under increasing criticism in recent years. See Childs and Krook (2005). 9. List PR systems are the most common of the PR systems. In a list PR system voters vote for a party rather than a candidate; parties receive seats in proportion to their overall share of the vote. Winning candidates are taken from the lists in order of their respective position. In closed-list systems electors cannot influence which party candidates are elected. The first-past-the-post system is one of four types of plurality-majority systems. Elections are held in single-member districts, and the candidate with the most votes (though not necessarily an absolute majority) wins. Semi-PR electoral systems, of which there are two types, fall between the plurality-majority and PR systems (Matland 2002, 2–3). Single-member district majoritarian systems (such as the firstpast-the-post system, the world’s most commonly used electoral system) “have consistently proven the worst possible system for women” (Matland 2002, 9). 10. See Ibrahim (2004) for an analysis of the impact of first ladies in politics in Africa, even today. 11. Two recent studies of women’s increased electoral representation in Africa draw many of the same conclusions that we do. Ballington (2004) identifies the use of specific electoral systems and quotas, the strength and cohesion of national women’s movements, pressure exerted by international women’s movements and organizations, and the strategic use of windows of political opportunity as the factors giving rise to women’s increased political representation in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s. Morna (2004) ties women’s increased representation in a few Southern African countries to a PR electoral system and party-based gender quotas or reserved seats for women. She also finds that countries with the highest proportion of women in politics have recently emerged from struggle or conflict situations, or have ruling parties with social democratic inclinations, or both. 12. Molyneux defined women’s practical needs to include the most pressing basic needs for safe shelter, adequate nutrition, health care, and clean water for themselves and their families and the necessity of secure employment to ensure their continued access to these basic needs. Beyond these basic necessities for survival, Molyneux delineated women’s strategic needs that would drastically improve their status in society, such as legal protections, educational access, employment and land rights, and an end to gender violence. 13. Ranchod-Nilsson (1998, 274) attributes the 1999 repeal of the Legal Age of Majority Act in Zimbabwe to an increasing consolidation of power by a single-party state, resulting in a transformation of the state’s “gender ideology,” and a dramatic change in the “cast of state insiders and outsiders.”\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 31\n\n2 Mozambique: Empowering Women Through Family Law Jennifer Leigh Disney\n\nWith nearly 35 percent of its National Assembly seats held by women, Mozambique had one of the highest percentages of women in parliament in mid-2005, ranking second in Africa and ninth in the world.1 This is an amazing achievement for one of the poorest countries in Africa. Yet Mozambique has a Gender-Related Development Index of 0.339, according to the 2004 UNDP Human Development Report.2 It appears, then, that there is a gap between the quantitative representation of women in parliament in Mozambique and the qualitative capacity of women to effect change on behalf of women’s political, economic, and sociocultural rights and interests. Women’s political representation numerically does not necessarily translate into women-centered policy initiatives substantively. In other words, the representation of women in national legislatures is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for women’s empowerment. The successful achievement of 34.8 percent women members of parliament (MPs) in Mozambique must be analyzed both in terms of how this representation was achieved and to what extent it has resulted in the implementation of a policy agenda focused on improving the quality of women’s rights, status, and lives in Mozambique, thereby raising the question of what constitutes a feminist policy agenda in Mozambique and for Mozambican women. In this chapter I will discuss the political representation of women in Mozambique and attempt to assess the impact of such representation. Tremendous achievements have been made in terms of political representation and basic constitutional equality for women. However, years of legal inaction and pervasive cultural patriarchies continue to prevent 31\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 32\n\n32\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nsignificant challenges to women’s oppression in the spheres of home and family, particularly in the areas of domestic labor, reproductive rights, and domestic violence. Women’s subordinate status in the sphere of the family, both culturally and materially, was not adequately addressed by the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) revolution, but it is finally being addressed legally in the postrevolutionary, multiparty Assembly of the Republic, due, to a large extent, to the lobbying efforts and advocacy of women. After a brief history of women’s experiences in Mozambique and a discussion of their path to political office, I will use the New Family Law as a case study to analyze the impact of women in parliament. The New Family Law, in draft form for over twenty years before getting through the Mozambican parliament in December 2003, epitomizes both the historical and cultural impediments to change as well as the legal and material achievements of Mozambican women lobbying in parliament and organizing in civil society. Through a combination of government initiatives, efforts of women MPs, and, most importantly, pressures and demands placed on both by women’s organizations in civil society, an extremely progressive Family Law was passed after years of research and struggle. In this chapter I highlight that process, with a particular focus on the relationship between women MPs and women leaders in civil society. Finally, I conclude with an assessment of the possibilities and limitations women face for future organizing in the Mozambican National Assembly by addressing the issues raised by women MPs about the (as yet unattained) creation of a bipartisan parliamentary women’s caucus.3\n\nA Brief History of Women in Mozambique\n\nOne interesting feature of Mozambique that sets it apart from many of its neighbors is the Marxist-Leninist ideology of its successful national liberation movement, which became the ruling political party at independence and still governs today in the post-transition period. Mozambican independence from Portugal was won through the success of several anticolonial guerrilla movements that joined under the leadership of Eduardo Mondlane and Frelimo to fight for an independent Mozambique. In 1974, after a ten-year war of liberation (and a military coup d’état in Lisbon), Frelimo seized state power and became the government of an independent Mozambique. In 1977 Frelimo officially adopted Marxism-Leninism as its ideology. In 1992, after a sixteen-\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 33\n\nMozambique\n\n33\n\nyear war against the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), a foreign-created and -funded counterinsurgency force established in 1976 by Rhodesian intelligence and subsequently funded by South Africa’s apartheid regime,4 Frelimo embraced multiparty democracy. A United Nations peacekeeping operation in Mozambique was created to monitor the implementation of the 1992 Rome Peace Accord, demobilize Renamo and Frelimo soldiers, transform Renamo from a military force into a political party, and create a stable environment for the country’s first multiparty elections in 1994. Mozambique’s transition from a Marxist-Leninist, one-party state to a neoliberal-democratic-capitalist, multiparty state in the 1990s has had a significant impact on women’s organization and participation in politics. Women in Mozambique have transformed themselves from being mobilized by Frelimo for the purpose of achieving the nationalist and socialist goals of the party to organizing themselves for feminist political change within an active and growing women’s movement. During the revolutionary rule of Frelimo in the pretransition period there was only one women’s organization in Mozambique: the Organization of Mozambican Women (OMM). The OMM was created during the national liberation struggle in Tanzania in 1973. Former OMM secretarygeneral and current Frelimo MP Salome Moiana explained: “The OMM did not arise as an autonomous initiative of women. It was, rather, an expression of FRELIMO’s will to liberate women” (Women’s International Resource Exchange [WIRE] 1980, 31). The OMM accepted the analysis that the goal for which Frelimo was fighting was the “liberation of all the people from the exploitation which is also the cause of the oppression of women” (WIRE 1980, 31). The OMM grew out of the first Frelimo women’s organization, the Women’s Detachment, a military unit created in 1968 as an experiment to see how women could contribute to the armed struggle. In many ways the presence of armed women in and of itself served as a critical form of political education to “dispel myths about the innate incapacity of women” (WIRE 1980, 31). At the very least, it sparked a discourse about the differences and similarities between men and women. Manuel Tome, former Frelimo secretary-general and current Frelimo MP, described the debate that took place “trying to give women their adequate place in the armed struggle,” culminating in the creation of the Women’s Detachment in 1968: “There were very interesting discussions: women cannot do fighting versus women can do the same work. Of course, women and men are not biologically identical, but we are essentially the same. The Women’s Detachment was a turning point for women in Frelimo: not\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 34\n\n34\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nonly were they taking care of children and old people, but they were also freedom fighters.”5 Women’s involvement in the Mozambican revolution as freedom fighters helped challenge traditional notions of women’s inferiority.6 Indeed, some have claimed that it was women’s military involvement in the war that gave them greater credibility in the early 1990s when they started demanding peace.7 One of the most important legacies of Frelimo’s Marxist-Leninist doctrine was the incorporation of women into the national liberation struggle and the inclusion of women’s emancipation as one of the party’s stated goals. However, this same legacy contains several key limitations: (1) the assumption that the exploitation of all Mozambicans and the exploitation of Mozambican women was the same exploitation, and that a fight to end the exploitation of (paid, male) workers in the public sphere of the market would also automatically eliminate women’s oppression, and thus necessarily liberate women; (2) the focus on state-led, largescale economic development projects despite the fact that the most popular form of agricultural production was family farming and was performed predominantly by women; and (3) the productivist, economistic way that women’s emancipation was conceptualized, thus increasing women’s work burden by bringing them into the paid labor force while ignoring their oppression in the sphere of the home and family, and not simultaneously encouraging men to engage in reproductive labor.8 Thus, while the Marxist-Leninist (male) leaders of Frelimo deserve credit for integrating women into the revolutionary struggle, they also deserve criticism for circumscribing and limiting women’s roles once they got there. However, several important laws were passed in Mozambique after independence to grant women rights in the economic sphere. The Law of Sixty Days, passed in 1976, permits pregnant women workers sixty days’ paid leave. Article 228 of the Rural Labor Code grants all women workers the right to miss two days of work per month without losing any salary. And in 1981–1982, the Labor Act was passed to protect women from job and wage discrimination. Yet all of this legislation applies to women in the formal sector labor force, although there are very few. More than 95 percent of women in Mozambique work in subsistence agriculture. Women “are the main people directly responsible for food production, and through their domestic work ensure the reproduction of the labor force. Due to their excessive workloads and low educational levels, women continue to occupy the worst paid jobs and to have difficulty in obtaining formal employment” (The Situation of Women in Mozambique 1994, 29).\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 35\n\nMozambique\n\n35\n\nMozambique’s 1975 constitution contained several strong statements against oppression and exploitation and for women’s empowerment. The constitution declared “the elimination of colonial and traditional oppression and exploitation structures and their related mentality.” It also stated that women’s emancipation is “one of the essential tasks of the state” and established that “women and men have equal rights and duties in the economic sphere.” This principle is restated later when the constitution declares that “women and men have the same rights and are subject to the same duties” and that this notion should guide “all state legislative and executive action” that “protects the marriage, the family, motherhood and childhood.” Despite the constitutional mention of the family, fatherhood is conspicuously absent from the list of things the state must protect, suggesting that the discourse of Frelimo was at best gendered and at worst patriarchal. The sphere of home, family, and marriage continued to be understood as the sphere of women and children, thus perpetuating the sexual division of labor that allows men to abdicate their responsibility to engage in the reproductive labor of the household, including family farming, food provision, cooking, cleaning, and child care. The history of male labor migrancy in Mozambique has often been cited as a major contributing factor to this sexual division of labor. In fact, migrant labor has both contributed to and challenged the sexual division of labor in Mozambique in interesting ways. Men’s migration to urban areas left women in the rural areas tending to the fields and engaging in all of the labor of the family economy. It also created the conditions for women to become heads of household, pursue income-generating survival strategies, and assert decisionmaking power in the family. Still, while women were encouraged, and often through necessity forced, to engage in the “productive” labor of the money economy, men were not equally encouraged to assist in the unpaid labor of the family economy. Though equality between men and women was established in the 1975 constitution, it was not codified in the civil or customary law. This contradiction was most evident with respect to the Nationality Law and the Family Law. The Nationality Law (enacted on the same day as the constitution of 1975) deprived Mozambican women of their citizenship when they married foreign men, though not Mozambican men when they married foreign women (Berg and Gundersen 1992, 252). This law remained in effect until 1987, despite its unconstitutionality. At the second national congress of the OMM in 1976, President Samora Machel argued that Mozambican women were weaker than Mozambican men and thus would be influenced by foreign men in a way that Mozambican men\n\n02_Chap02.qrk 12/6/05 12:29 PM Page 36\n\n36\n\nWomen in African Parliaments\n\nwould not be by foreign women. Even the OMM claimed that enemy infiltration was "
