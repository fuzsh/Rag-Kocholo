        "text": "Elisabeth Domitien (born c. 1925, Lobaye region, Ubangi-Shari [now Central African Republic]—died April 26, 2005, Bimbo, Central African Republic) was a businesswoman and politician who was the prime minister of the Central African Republic (1975–76), the first woman to serve as prime minister of a sub-Saharan African country.\n\nActive in politics from an early age, Domitien was a supporter of Jean-Bédel Bokassa, who took power in a 1965 coup. In 1972 she became vice president of the Central African Republic’s only legal political party, the Social Evolution Movement of Black Africa. In January 1975 Bokassa appointed her to the newly created post of prime minister, but, following her opposition to his proposal for a monarchy, he dismissed her in April 1976. She was briefly put under house arrest and later, following a coup against Bokassa in 1979, was put on trial. After Domitien served a brief prison term, her political activity was restricted."
