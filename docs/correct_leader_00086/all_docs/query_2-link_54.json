        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2021\n\nA January ruling by the Constitutional Court found that the December 2020 presidential elections had been legal, rejecting the appeals of the opposition and confirming the reelection of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra. The election, in which Touadéra took 53.16 percent of the votes, was marked by significant flaws and low voter turnout.\n\nThe Constitutional Court also ruled in January that only 22 of the 140 members of Parliament had been elected outright in the December 2020 first-round polls, overturning the election results in a number of constituencies due to numerous irregularities, including voter intimidation and ballot box tampering. Additional rounds of voting were held in March, May, and July to fill the remaining seats, and were largely allowed to proceed peacefully.\n\nFighting between armed militant groups and the Central African Armed Forces (FACA)—supported by Russian and Rwandan military reinforcements and MINUSCA (United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic)—continued throughout the year, despite Touadéra’s declaration of a cease-fire in October.\n\nThe National Assembly voted to impose a six-month state of emergency in February in response to continuing violent attacks carried out by armed rebel groups throughout the country. During the state of emergency, administrative and judicial authorities severely restricted the rights of many of the country’s opposition leaders, preventing them from leaving the country and threatening to revoke their parliamentary immunity.\n\nIn October, the Central African government officially acknowledged that rebel militants, FACA troops, and Russian forces in the country had committed numerous human rights violations against civilians in the CAR. Though government officials promised to enforce sanctions against the perpetrators, no meaningful action had been taken by year’s end."
