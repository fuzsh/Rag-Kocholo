He resigned his command when peace was restored but soon became dissatisfied with the Benito Juárez administration. He led an unsuccessful protest against the 1871 reelection of Juárez, who died in 1872. He continued his protests in an unsuccessful revolt against Pres. Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada in 1876, after which he fled to the U.S. Six months later, however, he returned and defeated the government forces at the Battle of Tecoac (November 1876), and in May 1877 he was formally elected president. He began a slow process of consolidation of power and built up a strong political machine. He decided not to run for another term himself but handpicked his successor, Gen. Manuel González, and became minister of development (1880-81) and governor of Oaxaca (1881-83). Dissatisfied with González, he ran for the presidency again in 1884 and was elected. He produced an orderly and systematic government with a military spirit. He succeeded in destroying local and regional leadership until the majority of public employees answered directly to him. Even the legislature was composed of his friends, and the press was muffled. On Feb. 17, 1908, he announced his retirement. Immediately opposition and pro-government groups began to scramble to find suitable presidential candidates. Then he decided not to retire but to allow Francisco Madero to run against him. Madero lost the election, but when he resorted to a military revolution, the government proved surprisingly weak and collapsed. Díaz resigned and went into exile.\n\nDíaz, Rodolfo (Alejandro) (b.

A descendant of José María Díaz Ordaz, associate of 19th-century Mexican leader Benito Juárez, Díaz Ordaz gained a reputation as a labour-law specialist while serving as president of Mexico's Central Council of Conciliation and Arbitration. He served as supreme court president in his native state of Puebla before being elected to the Mexican Senate in 1946. He was named to a post in the interior ministry in 1952, and in 1958 was appointed interior minister by Pres. Adolfo López Mateos. In July 1964 he was elected to the presidency as the Partido Revolucionario Institucional candidate to succeed López Mateos. Díaz Ordaz's administration emphasized economic development for Mexico. On Oct. 2, 1968, government troops and riot policemen engaged student demonstrators in a bloody clash that became known as the \"Massacre at Tlatelolco.\" Although the official death toll included only 40 students killed when troops opened fire on the demonstrators, other reports claimed that hundreds died. He continued to provoke strong public reaction years after he left office. In 1977 when he was named ambassador to Spain, the novelist Carlos Fuentes resigned as ambassador to France, and Mexican newspapers again unfavourably reiterated the drastic measures taken at the Massacre at Tlatelolco. Four months after assuming his post, Díaz Ordaz announced his resignation, which his spokesman said was \"strictly due to eye trouble.\"\n\nDíaz Ordóñez, Virgilio (b.

He was the country's first vice president, as well as minister of finance, in 1970-72, then resigned and became ambassador to Belgium (1972-74). He rejoined the cabinet in 1974 as minister of economic planning up to July 1975 when he resigned again from Pres. Sir Dawda Jawara's government; on Sept. 7, 1975, he formed the National Convention Party (NCP). In the aftermath of the 1981 abortive coup led by Kukoi Samba Sanyang he was detained for 11 months, charged with treason, only to be acquitted and discharged in 1982. Although his party fiercely contested elections in 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992, he was never successful in defeating Jawara's PPP. Following the 1994 military coup that toppled the PPP government, the NCP went into decline as the military junta banned party politics. Dibba was criticized for not having condemned the coup. The NCP resurfaced in 2001 and contested the general elections, but failed dismally. In 2002 he was appointed by Pres. Yahya Jammeh as speaker of the National Assembly but he was removed unceremoniously for his alleged involvement in the March 2006 foiled coup led by army chief Col. Ndure Cham.

In 1936 he was chosen as leader of the Saskatchewan Conservative Party, serving at that post until 1940, when he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons for the constituency of Lake Centre. His quest for leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1948 was unsuccessful, but he became party leader on Dec. 14, 1956. The general election of June 1957 brought victory for the Conservatives, breaking a 22-year Liberal monopoly, and Diefenbaker succeeded Louis Saint Laurent as prime minister. He was the first head of government to come from outside the British and French communities (his ancestors were German). He was also foreign minister until September 1957. In the 1958 election the Conservatives won an unprecedented 208 of the 265 House seats. In the next election, however, in 1962, the Conservatives lost their majority. As prime minister, \"Dief the Chief\" urged increased independence from the U.S. and refused to arm Canada's NATO force with U.S. nuclear weapons. Diefenbaker also pushed for the development of Canada's natural resources and its vast Arctic northlands. A crisis over the proposed manufacture of nuclear weapons in Canada caused several ministerial resignations and forced Diefenbaker to call an election in 1963, when Lester B. Pearson, leading the Liberals, became prime minister. After struggling to retain party leadership, Diefenbaker resigned in 1967 and was succeeded by Robert Stanfield (September 9). He continued to occupy a seat on the opposition front bench and remained an acerbic critic of Liberal governments.

July 1, 2014, London, England), Nigerian politician. After the fall of Gen. Yakubu Gowon's regime in 1975, he was found guilty of corruption, but this did not prevent his political reappearance when the return to civilian rule took place in 1979. He was made minister of transport by Pres. Alhaji Shehu Shagari, and because of his closeness to the president he became one of the most powerful politicians in the country. He was derided by his enemies for never having personally won an election. Dikko achieved the height of power as the manager of Shagari's 1983 election campaign, but by that time he had made many enemies and, it was said, was reappointed as minister of transport only because of Shagari's gratitude over the election result. Dikko's return to power was seen by many as a denial of Shagari's claim that he would make an independent new start and root out corruption. Dikko was known as Shagari's \"third ear,\" and it was rumoured that most important contracts required his approval. When the military, headed by Maj.Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, seized power again at the end of 1983, Dikko left the country and said he had \"declared war\" on the new regime. In Nigeria he was accused of setting aside $300 million (presumably of ill-gotten gains) to finance a mercenary-led expedition against the new government. The two chief charges against him were that he had received kickbacks while in office and that he had rigged the 1983 elections. A spectacular but unsuccessful attempt was made by Nigerians to kidnap Dikko from Britain in a crate from Stansted Airport in July 1984. As a result, relations between Britain and Nigeria were temporarily brought to a low ebb. He returned to Nigeria in 1994 when the administration of Gen. Sani Abacha nominated him to participate in a constitutional conference.\n\nDikov, Diko (Dimitrov) (b. Nov. 2, 1910, Berkovitsa, Bulgaria - d.

He became undersecretary of state for economic affairs in 1959 and was serving in that role when tapped unexpectedly to join the new Democratic administration in 1961. As an original member of John F. Kennedy's cabinet, he was one of its two high-profile Republicans - along with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara - surrounded by Democrats. Dillon also was among the cabinet officers who stayed on at the behest of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. He returned to private life in 1965. Under both presidents he led the Alliance for Progress, a program to spur economic development in Latin America, an effort he had earlier spearheaded as a founder of the Inter-American Development Bank. Known as a staunch advocate of free trade, Dillon as treasury secretary developed policies aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit by controlling inflation and expanding exports, and backed U.S. cooperation with the European Common Market. He also strongly advocated a massive tax cut program to spur economic growth. The tax measure was pending at the time of Kennedy's death, and Dillon won Johnson's support for its passage by Congress in 1964. In 1989 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He early became deputy leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition to Eamon de Valera's party, Fianna Fáil, but in 1942 he resigned because of Fine Gael's support for Irish neutrality during World War II. Dillon's first tenure of the post of minister of agriculture (1948-51) was as an independent, but he rejoined Fine Gael in 1951. He served again as minister of agriculture in 1954-57.

He was also ambassador to Cuba (1978-83), Panama (1979-81), Jamaica (1979-84), and Guyana (1979-81).\n\nF. Dimitrov\n\nDimitrov, Filip (Dimitrov) (b. March 31, 1955, Sofia, Bulgaria), prime minister of Bulgaria (1991-92). On Dec. 11, 1990, he succeeded Petur Beron as the chair of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) National Coordinating Council. Dimitrov had no tolerance for the Communists as he was known for not accepting any compromise with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). Dimitrov believed in \"shock therapy\" for the economy. On Nov. 4, 1991, he was appointed prime minister by Pres. Zhelyu Zhelev. Dimitrov failed in solving Bulgaria's most important problems such as the privatization of the state firms, inflation, and unemployment. All of this failure was mainly due to the non-cooperation of the BSP, but it was also due to his stubbornness. He also did not succeed in keeping his party united as the UDF began to split into factions. On Oct. 28, 1992, he resigned his cabinet after he lost the necessary parliamentary support of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). He tried to appoint a new cabinet, but it was not approved. A cabinet of experts was formulated under the leadership of Lyuben Berov. This government was supported by the BSP and the MRF. Dimitrov made numerous efforts to oust this group from power, but after the 1994 parliamentary elections, in which the UDF lost badly, Ivan Kostov replaced Dimitrov as the UDF chair on Dec. 29, 1994. Dimitrov served as permanent representative to the United Nations in 1997-98 and as ambassador to the United States in 1998-2002.\n\nG. Dimitrov\n\nDimitrov (Mihailov), Georgi (b. June 30 [June 18, O.S.], 1882, Kovachevtsi, Bulgaria - d. July 2, 1949, Barvikha, near Moscow, U.S.S.R.), prime minister of Bulgaria (1945-49). His oratorical gifts secured him the secretaryship of the Bulgarian Trade Union Confederation in 1904. Elected to the Sabranie in 1913, he led the socialist parliamentary opposition to the voting of national war credits in 1915. He was briefly imprisoned for sedition in 1917-18 and played a major role in the formation of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1919. He journeyed to the Soviet Union, where he was elected to the executive committee of the Comintern (Communist International) in 1921. In 1923 he fostered a Communist revolt in Bulgaria that ended in bloodshed and defeat. He escaped to Yugoslavia, but soon moved to Vienna, where he lived until 1929, when he moved to Berlin. After the Reichstag fire of Feb. 27, 1933, which provided Adolf Hitler, the new German chancellor, with an excuse for a decree outlawing his Communist opponents, Dimitrov was accused with other Communist leaders of plotting the fire. At his trial Dimitrov thoroughly bested the Nazi prosecution and was acquitted. He settled in Moscow and, as secretary-general of the Comintern's executive committee (1935-43), encouraged the formation of popular-front movements against the Nazi menace, except when his patron, Iosif Stalin, and Hitler were cooperating. During 1944 he directed the resistance to Bulgaria's Axis satellite government, and in 1945 he returned to Bulgaria, where he was immediately appointed prime minister of a Communist-dominated Fatherland Front government. He effected the Communist consolidation of power, relying on his fiery oratory for gaining and holding great authority even among the strongly individual Bulgarian peasantry.\n\nN.

Since then Dini, nicknamed \"The Toad\" in Italy because of his appearance, developed an unexpected flair for politics as the leader of the small Italian Renewal Party. As foreign minister during the Romano Prodi administration, Dini made a series of overtures to \"rogue\" Islamic countries including Iran, Libya, and Algeria, and also made the first visit by a high-ranking European Union official to Cuba. In 1997, when anarchy broke out in Albania, he played a key role in mustering international support for an Italian-led multinational force to restore stability.\n\nDiniz, Alberto Augusto (Oliveira) (b. 1868? - d. Oct. 17?, 1956, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), governor of Acre (1926).\n\nDiniz, Antero Alves Monteiro (b.

July 10, 1927, Trenton, N.J. - d. Nov. 23, 2020, New York City), mayor of New York City (1990-94). He served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean conflict. In 1965 he was elected to the New York state assembly. In 1973 he was named New York City's deputy mayor for planning, but he was forced to withdraw under the shadow of his having neglected to file income tax returns from 1969 to 1972. From 1975 to 1985 he served as city clerk and was then elected Manhattan borough president. On Sept. 12, 1989, he defeated incumbent Ed Koch in the Democratic Party mayoral primary. Then on November 7, Dinkins again seized victory when he defeated his Republican opponent, former U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, to become New York City's first black mayor. He won the election with the support of a large number of blacks and Hispanics and with nearly one-third of the white vote. A far cry from the flamboyant, acerbic Koch, Dinkins had a soft-spoken, unassuming style that seemed to be just what New Yorkers were looking for to lead them into the 1990s. Accompanying Dinkins' sweet taste of victory was the bitter reality of the many problems that he would have to face. In addition to the $1 billion deficit, there were the 50,000 homeless, the AIDS and drug problems, and racial tensions. Prior to the election he was credited with staying neutral concerning a racially motivated killing in Brooklyn, and asking for calm. Racial harmony became a campaign issue, and Dinkins vowed to \"bring New York City together.\" After the primary Dinkins had told supporters, \"You voted your hopes and not your fears.\" With his easygoing style, he did ease racial tensions but mounting fiscal crises and a persistent crime rate led to his defeat at the hands of Giuliani in 1993.\n\nDinmukhamedov, Galey (Afzaletdinovich) (b. 1892, Novo-Ibraykino, Kazan province [now in Tatarstan republic], Russia - d.

Three years later he became a priest, then an archbishop in 1962, and he was named patriarch in 1981. In 2000, Diodoros met with Pope John Paul II during the pontiff's visit to the Holy Land. The pope said then he hoped the Vatican and the Orthodox church could overcome theological differences, such as disagreements over the nature of Christ and the extent of the authority of the papacy.\n\nDiogo, Bornito de Sousa Baltazar (b.

Nov. 11, 1950, Athens), prime minister of Greece (1949-50); grandson of Diomidis Kyriakos. He joined Eleftherios Venizelos' Liberal government as minister of finance (1912-15). After World War I he retired from politics, but served as minister without portfolio and acting foreign minister (1918-19) and briefly again as finance minister (1922) and in 1923 was elected governor of the National Bank, at that time still the bank of issue; he negotiated important public loans, besides conducting negotiations which led to the creation of the Bank of Greece as the bank of issue (1928). Retiring from public life in 1930, he was honorary president of the Supreme Economic Council before World War II and from 1945 president of the Supreme Reconstruction Board. On Jan. 20, 1949, Diomidis joined the coalition government of Themistoklis Sophoulis as a non-party deputy prime minister and minister without portfolio, and on the death of Sophoulis succeeded him on June 30 as prime minister of a Populist-Liberal coalition cabinet.

Sept. 28, 1955, Québec, Que.), foreign minister of Canada (2015-17). First elected to the House of Commons in a 1996 by-election, he became minister of intergovernmental affairs (1996-2003), the highlight of his tenure being the creation of the so-called Clarity Act (passed in 2000), which makes it much harder for Quebec to break away from Canada. Dion said the act was one of his finest accomplishments, but some in Quebec never forgave him, one cartoonist regularly portraying him as a rat. In 2004-06 he was environment minister. In December 2006 he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, defeating Michael Ignatieff on the fourth ballot. He came into the leadership convention in fourth place but swayed delegates by giving perhaps the most impassioned speech of the leading contenders in which he stressed energy conservation. In the October 2008 elections he led the Liberals to a historic low, and soon afterwards said he would turn over the reins of the party to the winner of a leadership convention in May 2009. However, in December 2008 he helped engineer a coalition deal with the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois designed to remove the Conservative minority government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and install Dion as prime minister. But Harper, whose public support increased after the opposition's manoeuvring, forestalled a defeat by getting parliament prorogued until January, and Dion, who remained unpopular with Canadians, then announced he would resign early; he was replaced by Ignatieff on December 10. In 2017 he became ambassador to Germany; in 2022 he was appointed ambassador to France.\n\nDion Ngute\n\nDionne\n\nDion Ngute, Joseph (b.

He was a founder member (1946) of the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain and founder of its local branch, the Niger Progressive Party (PPN), and represented Niger in the French National Assembly (1946-51, 1956-58). During the transition period before Niger's independence, the French government banned (1959) all political parties except the PPN and chose Diori to serve as Niger's prime minister (1958-60) and president (1960). On Nov. 11, 1960, he was formally voted into office in the first postindependence elections. Despite pressure from France, he supported Nigeria during the secession (1967-70) of Biafra, and he gained worldwide respect for his attempts to negotiate a peaceful settlement in the conflict. Diori's administration, however, was rife with corruption, and he was unable to implement much-needed reforms or to alleviate the widespread famine brought on by the Sahelian drought of the early 1970s. He was deposed by the army chief of staff, Lt.Col. Seyni Kountché, on April 15, 1974. Diori was released from prison in 1980, but he remained under house arrest until April 1987.\n\nA.

He quickly established a reputation for fair-mindedness when he oversaw the liberalization of the political system. In 1970 he became prime minister, a post that had only just been created through a change in the constitution. In 1970-72 he was also defense minister. He retained the premiership for 11 years and upon the retirement of Pres. Léopold Sédar Senghor and in accordance with the constitution, he succeeded to the presidency (Jan. 1, 1981). He was elected in his own right two years later, was reelected in 1988, and won a third term in multiparty elections in March 1993. He has also served as secretary-general (1981-96) and president (1996- ) of the Socialist Party of Senegal. In 1982-89 he was also president of the Senegambia confederation. Diouf gained international prominence as a delegate to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1983, when he played a key role at the June 1983 summit meeting, and as that organization's chairman in 1985-86, when his decisive leadership and moderation restored confidence in that troubled body. He served a second term as OAU chairman in 1992-93 and he also served as chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Islamic Conference, and the G-15 nations. He stepped down as president willingly after losing the 2000 elections to Abdoulaye Wade, a move that brought him respect in a continent where leaders tend to cling to power. In 2003-14 he was secretary-general of La Francophonie.\n\nDiouf, Coumba Ndoffène (b. Dec. 29, 1932), foreign minister of Senegal (1972-73).

June 4, 2001, Chauni, near Kathmandu), king of Nepal (2001). He was the eldest son of Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva and was declared heir apparent in 1972 after his father became king. After his early education in Kathmandu, Dipendra, like his father, went to Eton College in Britain. There, he was reportedly excused from chapel when he turned 18. According to Nepali tradition, the prince effectively became a god on his birthday and he could not be seen worshipping another. Known as \"Dippy\" to his friends, Dipendra returned to Kathmandu to study at Tribhuvan University. He later joined the Royal Nepal Military Academy. In 1990, he was commissioned as the colonel-in-chief of the Royal Nepalese Army, an honorary title given to the heir to the throne. At a banquet during Prince Charles' 1998 visit to Nepal, Dipendra told him of his country's sorrow at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Dipendra also praised Eton for giving him a sense of \"fair play and discipline.\" Childhood classmates remember him as friendly and intelligent, and always at the top of the class.

He attended the U.S. Army School of Infantry at Fort Benning in 1971-72, returning to hold several command positions. From 1979 to 1980 Diya commanded the Nigerian contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. After the military overthrew the Second Republic government of Pres. Shehu Shagari in December 1983, Diya was appointed military governor of Ogun state (1984-85). There he introduced a controversial tax on the lavish social parties for which southwestern Nigeria is famous. Diya, an infantry officer, opposed the military's annulment of a presidential poll in June 1993 believed to have been won by his Yoruba kinsman Moshood Abiola. During the crisis following the annulment of the election, Diya was the intermediary between the military and largely-Yoruba pro-democracy activists who urged Sani Abacha, as the most senior officer at the time, to seize power and hand over to Abiola. Diya, who became chief of defense staff in September 1993, was the strongman behind Abacha when he seized power in November 1993 and an early pillar of his administration, but his influence waned once Abacha consolidated power. Diya, a lawyer, also convinced three prominent Yoruba leaders to join Abacha's cabinet, helping to give the government credibility, but all three were eventually sacked. Diya was arrested in 1997. Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took over after Abacha's death in 1998, immediately freed a number of political prisoners but for unexplained reasons did not free Lieutenant General Diya and other serving military men sentenced for alleged coup attempts against Abacha. However, Diya was the chief beneficiary of a 1999 amnesty granted to 95 people accused of plotting against Abacha.\n\nDizdarevic\n\nDjá\n\nDizdarevic, Raif (b. 1926, Fojnica, Bosnia), Yugoslav politician.

March 12, 2003, Belgrade, Serbia), prime minister of Serbia (2001-03). He was never a member of the long-ruling Communist party. Having fled to West Germany to avoid prison after being accused of activities against the state, he returned to Belgrade in 1989, co-founding the Democratic Party which he led inside the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) umbrella alliance. Djindjic was usually perceived as a pragmatic politician but did not enjoy the same broad popularity of the other leading figure in the DOS, Vojislav Kostunica. He was frequently branded a traitor by allies of Pres. Slobodan Milosevic and media outlets they controlled. In 1996, after Milosevic ignored an opposition victory in local elections, Djindjic organized three months of daily protest rallies in Belgrade. Milosevic eventually relented, and Djindjic became the first non-Communist mayor of the city. But he lasted less than a year in the post before the coalition that nominated him split up and he was voted out in September 1997. He was long a leading figure in anti-Milosevic campaigns. He spearheaded a drive to oust the Yugoslav strongman in late 2000. He took office as Serbian prime minister in January 2001. He faced hyperinflation and a chaotic government system where public sector workers often had to wait months to be paid. He stood for a market economy and said that Serbia's future lay in closer integration with the West. Milosevic's arrest and deportation led to a rift between Djindjic and Kostunica, who was shocked at the way that Djindjic used the law to seal Milosevic's fate. Djindjic was shot dead in front of the government building, apparently by members of an organized crime syndicate known as the Zemun Clan.\n\nDjindjolia, Sokrat (Rachevich), also spelled Dzhindzholia or Jinjolia (b.
