        "text": "It‚Äôs emotional! Snoop Dogg to carry Olympic torch ahead of opening ceremony later TODAY: When Snoop Dogg agreed to become an Olympic torchbearer, the hip-hop star recalled an emotional, iconic moment watching Muhammad Ali light the cauldron at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Now, the 52-year-old US rapper hopes to recreate some of that magic for a global audience watching the #ParisOlympics. ‚ÄúIt was emotional for all of us to see the champ holding that torch and walking up there,‚Äù Snoop Dogg said of the late Ali, who surprised the crowd when he lit the cauldron because he had #Parkinson's disease. Snoop Dogg will carry the torch in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, as the town's mayor, Mathieu Hanotin, confirmed earlier this week. The Saint-Denis stretch is the penultimate leg of the flame's journey before the relay ends at the #EiffelTower. The Olympic torch has crossed #France since starting its journey in May and has been carried by a host of different personalities, including former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, Formula One driver Charles Leclerc and actresses Halle Berry and Selma Hayek. Snoop Dogg, whose full name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, was born in Los Angeles - the host city for the 2028 Games. The US artist will be joined by fellow torchbearers in Saint-Denis, including French actress Laetitia Casta and French rapper MC Solaar. \"An international casting @SnoopDogg for the final journey of the Olympic flame. With a concert by @Slimaneoff as the highlight of this day, live on @FranceTV from the square in front of the Basilica,\" stated Hanotin on X. It has also been confirmed that other carriers in Saint-Denis Friday will include French actress Laetitia Casta, French rapper MC Solaar, and Ukrainian retired pole-vaulter Sergey Bubka. Despite some criticism online, Snoop has said he knows what‚Äôs at stake. ‚ÄúThis is my own version of it,\" #SnoopDogg said. \"I don‚Äôt want to get too emotional, but I know that this is special.‚Äù The identity of the personality who will be the final torchbearer for the lighting of the Olympic flame remains a closely guarded secret ‚Äî although former track and field sprinter Marie-Jos√© P√©rec and football legend Zinedine Zidane are among the favourites. The Olympic cauldron will be lit after the opening ceremony on the River Seine on Friday.

Ruto announced the nominees in an address to the nation on Wednesday. The president had promised to appoint a new ‚Äúbroad-based‚Äù cabinet in response to continuing nationwide #protests that have threatened his hold on power. The announcement came two weeks after Ruto scrapped the previous cabinet as the protests, prompted by planned tax hikes, swelled. A clampdown by the authorities helped raise the number of people killed to more than 50, with hundreds more wounded. The opposition figures appointed to the new cabinet are allies of political veteran Raila Odinga, whom Ruto defeated in #elections in 2022. John Mbadi Ngo‚Äôongo will lead the finance ministry and James Opiyo Wandayi was named energy minister. ‚ÄúI commend the leadership of diverse organisations ‚Ä¶ for their encouraging response to my outreach to consult on forming a broad-based government,‚Äù Ruto said in the address from his official residence. ‚ÄúTheir willingness to set aside partisan positions and interests in order to join a visionary partnership for the radical transformation of Kenya is a historic gesture of their patriotism.‚Äù Continue reading.. https://lnkd.in/dgwuxGma In the past fiscal year, #Kenya spent about three-quarters of its #tax income on repaying #debt, which the #InternationalMonetaryFund classifies as at high risk of distress. The nation is at the tail end of a $3.6 billion IMF financing program that requires it to accelerate domestic #revenue collection and curb borrowing.

This ambitious project, located just a stone's throw from the Stade de France, promises to be a meeting place and celebration ground for lovers of sport and #Africanculture. Africa Station is more than just a fan zone. It's a living space where #Parisians and #tourists alike will be able to watch the presentation of medals by #Africanchampions, as well as take part in a host ofsporting and cultural events. In partnership with the Maison de l'Afrique, the site will offer #exhibitions, #concerts and various activities highlighting the rich traditions and dynamism of the #Africancontinent. The initiative, supported by the city of L'√éle-Saint-Denis and theAssociation of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA), aims to create a bridge between communities and celebrate diversity. The French Minister for Sport, Am√©lie Oud√©a-Cast√©ra, expressed her enthusiasm for the project, describing it as\"a wonderful space for celebration\" that will strengthen the links between Seine-Saint-Denis, the Games and Africa. The choice of L'√éle-Saint-Denis to host Africa Station is no mean feat. The town, which forms an integral part of the Olympic territory with part of the athletes' village, is undergoing a profound transformation. Mayor Mohamed Gnabaly sees the project as an opportunity to instill pride and confidence in the future, while creating lasting links with African youth.

Since 2019, the African Blue Economy Strategy has been guiding us towards a brighter future through: 1. Fisheries and aquaculture 2. Maritime transport and security 3. Coastal tourism and climate resilience 4 Blue energy and resources 5. Good governance and job creation It's time to turn this vision into reality! Let's work together to unlock Africa's blue POTENTIAL - #AfricanUnion. Towards a Sustainable Blue Economy for #AFRICA: Water defines communities, eras and livelihoods. It means different things to different people. To some, it holds ancestral and traditional values, for others it symbolises superstition or fear, and for some others still, it embodies lifestyles and supports livelihoods. Thirty-two of fifty-five member states of the African Union are coastal states and another six are islands or archipelagos. This means that about one-third of African countries are landlocked and must rely on their coastal neighbours for much of their imports. The continent only represents 7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of maritime exports and imports by volume in a world in which 90 per cent of global international trade is sea-borne. Africa is host to a vast body of #BlueEconomy resources. Africa‚Äôs coastal and island states include an estimated 13 million km¬≤ of ocean territory. The continent includes over 30,000 km of #coastline and over 1.5 million km2 of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Africa also boasts an extensive network of inland freshwater sources, including seven major #rivers (over 2,000 km long), #lakes and #wetlands, spanning all five of the continent‚Äôs regional economic mechanisms in Central, East, North, Southern and West Africa. The relationship of Africa‚Äôs peoples to the continent‚Äôs waters has not always been harmonious. Many of these sources of water provided channels through which Africans were transported into #slavery overseas throughout the 17th century. Many perished. European contests over the control of Africa‚Äôs waters subsequently framed the #ScrambleforAfrica in the late 19th century. The General Act, adopted at the end of the #BerlinConference which partitioned the continent in February 1885, acknowledged that its goal was ‚Äúto assure to all nations the advantages of free navigation on the two chief rivers of Africa flowing into the #AtlanticOcean.‚Äù Continue reading.. https://lnkd.in/dYXeyCuQ #TransformingAfrica #TheAfricaWeWant #AfCFTA #BrandAfrica #AU #GDP #Investment #GlobalAFRICA #AfricaMeansBusiness #Trade #ThisIsAfrica #Diaspora #IT #OneAfrica #CreatingOneAfricanMarket #Invest #AfricaRising #FDI #IntraAfricanTrade #Agenda2063 #AUC #Partnerships #AfCFTATV #WB #BuildBackBetter #InvestInAfrica #AfricanUnity #IMF #WTO #AfDB #SAATM #Infrastructure #MadeInAfrica #AfCFTASecretariat #PAPSS #ZLECAF #JoinAfCFTA #AfricanSolutionsToAfricanProblems #Growth #AfricaBlueEconomy #BetterAfricaBetterWorld #StrongerTogether #AfricaYesWeCAN #AfricaToTheWorld\n\nAFRICA offers $193 BILLION renewables opportunity, Study Shows: #SubSaharanAfrica offers a $193 billion opportunity to invest in #renewableenergy and transmission by 2031, with returns a multiple of those in #Europe and the #US, according to a new study. Utility-scale #wind, #solar, storage and transmission projects across a number of African countries may yield an internal rate of return of 15% to 21%, significantly above the cost of capital and yields on sovereign #bonds, the study compiled by Wood Mackenzie Ltd. showed. Returns in the US and Europe are a little more than 5%. ‚ÄúAfrica represents a significantly underserved market,‚Äù the researchers wrote in the study that UK government agency MOBILIST and South Africa‚Äôs Revego Fund Managers sponsored. ‚ÄúRenewable-energy assets across the region also tend to be at earlier stages of development, offering growth upside.‚Äù Almost 600 million people in the region, or about half the #population, have no access to electricity. While that provides African governments with an expensive problem to solve, the lack of electricity infrastructure is also an opportunity for new projects to focus on renewable energy. Of the investment opportunity, national and micro-grids require $66 billion, the researchers said. They expect 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles) of transmission-line rollouts annually by 2031, compared with 6,355 kilometers last year. While #SouthAfrica üáøüá¶, #Nigeria üá≥üá¨ and #Kenya üá∞üá™ offer the largest solar-power markets, #Uganda üá∫üá¨ offers the best returns on renewable-energy projects, the study showed. Still, capital costs are higher than those in Europe and the US. https://lnkd.in/dGnExU9C More of AFRICA‚Äôs huge POTENTIAL. #TransformingAfrica #TheAfricaWeWant #AfCFTA #BrandAfrica #AU #GDP #Investment #Africa #AfricaMeansBusiness #ThisIsAfrica #Diaspora #IT #OneAfrica #AUC #TransAfricanHighway #SMEs #CreatingOneAfricanMarket #Invest #Tariffs #TheAfCFTAEffect #Trade #AI #AfricaRising #FDI #IntraAfricanTrade #Agenda2063 #Partnerships #AfCFTATV #WB #BuildBackBetter #InvestInAfrica #AfricanUnity #IMF #WTO #AfDB #TradeNotAid #AfCFTATrading #TravelToAfrica #CFTA #SAATM #TradeInAfrica #TradeUnderAfCFTA #JoinAfCFTA #AfricaOnTheMove #Infrastructure #Tourism #VisitAfrica #MadeInAfrica #AfCFTASecretariat #PanAfricanism #Investors #PAPSS #ZLECAF #AfricanSolutionsToAfricanProblems #Growth #BetterAfricaBetterWorld #StrongerTogether #Afreximbank #UnitedUnderAfCFTA #AfCFTA2024 #Africa2024 #AfricaYesWeCAN #AfricaToTheWorld #GlobalAFRICA\n\nZambia sees copper production up 40% by 2027. Here‚Äôs what to know: Zambia‚Äôs annual #copper production will grow more than 40% to one-million tons in 2027, according to the country‚Äôs Finance Ministry. Africa‚Äôs second-largest copper producer is seeking to take advantage of what many predict will be a supply shortfall in the coming years, as the #energy transition causes rising demand for the metal from #electricvehicles to #windfarms. Zambia‚Äôs copper output hit a 14-year low of 698,566 tons in 2023 as its mining sector faced frequent tax changes and constant clashes with the previous government. According to the medium-term budget plan published on Sunday by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, production is projected to increase each year from 2025 to 2027. That gain is predicated on the resolution of challenges at some of the country‚Äôs major mines, green-field projects and the expansion of existing facilities. The southern African nation, which generates about 70% of its #export earnings from copper, plans to increase the percentage of its landmass that‚Äôs mapped for #mineralresources through integrated #geophysical, #geological and #satelliteimagery surveys. #Zambia plans to more than quadruple copper output to three-million tons by 2031. https://lnkd.in/emJU6MaE Accelerating AFRICA‚Äôs Mineral POTENTIAL Zambia üáøüá≤ is an AfCFTA member country #UnitedUnderAfCFTA #AfricaYesWeCAN #TransformingAfrica #TheAfricaWeWant #AfCFTA #BrandAfrica #AU #GDP #Investment #Africa #AfricaMeansBusiness #ThisIsAfrica #Diaspora #IT #OneAfrica #AUC #TransAfricanHighway #SMEs #CreatingOneAfricanMarket #Invest #Tariffs #TheAfCFTAEffect #Trade #AI #AfricaRising #FDI #IntraAfricanTrade #Agenda2063 #Partnerships #AfCFTATV #WB #BuildBackBetter #InvestInAfrica #AfricanUnity #IMF #WTO #AfDB #TradeNotAid #AfCFTATrading #TravelToAfrica #CFTA #SAATM #TradeInAfrica #TradeUnderAfCFTA #JoinAfCFTA #AfricaOnTheMove #Infrastructure #Tourism #VisitAfrica #MadeInAfrica #AfCFTASecretariat #PanAfricanism #Investors #PAPSS #ZLECAF #AfricanSolutionsToAfricanProblems #Growth #BetterAfricaBetterWorld #StrongerTogether #Afreximbank #AfCFTA2024 #Africa2024 #AfricaToTheWorld #GlobalAFRICA\n\nHave you ever wondered how the LinkedIn algorithm works? Here‚Äôs what you need to know: LinkedIn is a bit of a different beast in the social network universe because the #LinkedIn algorithm is specifically designed to prevent #content from going viral. Yes, you read that right. The LinkedIn algorithm is based on connecting its users with only the most relevant professional advice and expertise. That requires a completely different approach than you use on other platforms, where content is often designed primarily to entertain. Recent LinkedIn algorithm updates mean focusing on your own expert knowledge is more important than ever. Here‚Äôs what you need to know to work with the algorithm going forward. What is the LinkedIn algorithm? The LinkedIn algorithm is a recommendation system that selects the posts that each user sees in their feed. The topics, people, and types of posts an individual is most likely to engage with determine what their feed will look like. LinkedIn has 950 million members and counting. The algorithm processes billions of posts per day ‚Äî all to make the newsfeed as interesting and informative as possible for every user. LinkedIn‚Äôs ultimate goal is to prioritize relevant, high quality content and promote engagement. The more time you spend on the platform, the better the algorithm will work for you. That said, LinkedIn is not a platform where you should expect your content to go viral. LinkedIn specifically says it ‚Äúis not designed for virality.‚Äù It‚Äôs about sharing knowledge and updates with people who care about that information and can use it to advance their careers. How does the LinkedIn algorithm work?
