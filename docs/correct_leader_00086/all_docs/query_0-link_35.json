Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirimavo Bandaranaike, prime minister of Ceylon, 1960\n\nSirimavo Bandaranaike was the modern world's first female head of government.\n\nShe succeeded her husband as prime minister of Ceylon — renamed Sri Lanka after it gained independence from Britain — after he was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959, then ran a campaign and won the popular vote.\n\nShe ultimately spent the rest of her life in politics. Three-and-a-half decades after she first became prime minister, she served under her daughter, who was elected president in 1994.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndira Ghandi, prime minister of India, 1964\n\nIndira Gandhi was the daughter of the first Indian prime minister to lead the country after colonial rule. After her father, she's the second-longest-serving prime minister.\n\nDuring her time in office, she worked to overturn the caste system but is also accused of contributing to the still-present tension between India and Pakistan. She was arrested in 1978 on corruption charges, but was reelected in 1980. In 1984, she was assassinated.\n\nThe Indira Awaas Yojana, a government housing program for the poor, is named after her, as is the Indira Gandhi National Open University, the largest university in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGolda Meir, prime minister of Israel, 1969\n\nGolda Meir, who was born in Kiev and raised in Milwaukee, joined the Labor Zionist youth movement and headed to Palestine in 1921 to join a kibbutz. There, she got involved in politics and contributed to the founding of Israel.\n\nIn 1969, she left retirement to lead the country following the sudden death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. Her decision to forgo a preemptive strike in the Yom Kippur War was widely criticized, and in 1974, she resigned.\n\nMeir died in 1978 of lymphatic cancer. Her story has since been featured in multiple plays and films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsabel Martinez de Peron, president of Argentina, 1974\n\nIsabel Martinez de Peron, the third wife of former president Juan Peron, was the first female president of any country. She served as both vice president and first lady before succeeding her husband when he died in office.\n\nPeron, who dropped out of school in fifth grade, was a nightclub dancer when she met her future husband. She became his secretary and was chosen as his running mate when he ran for office.\n\nHer presidency was plagued by political violence, and she was arrested in 2007 for the forced disappearance of an activist 30 years prior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElisabeth Domitien, prime minister of the Central African Republic, 1975\n\nElisabeth Domitien, a farmer and businesswoman, got involved in the anticolonial movement at age 20. She led the women's division of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa and was known for her powerful speeches.\n\nIn 1960, the country won its independence, and the liberation movement became the government. The new president, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, appointed her as prime minister, hoping a female leader would draw global attention. When Bokassa tried to proclaim himself emperor, and Domitien opposed him, she was fired.\n\nShe remained a prominent figure, as a former politician and businesswoman, until her death in 2005.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMargaret Thatcher, prime minister of the UK, 1975\n\nMargaret Thatcher — dubbed the \"Iron Lady\" by a Soviet journalist — was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century.\n\nBorn into a middle-class background, she was elected to Parliament in 1959 and resigned in 1990 after a challenge to her leadership.\n\nKnown for her uncompromising politics and shrewd leadership, Thatcher's conservative policies included economic deregulation and a controversial poll tax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenazir Bhutto, prime minister of Pakistan, 1988\n\nBenazir Bhutto was the daughter of a former prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who founded the Pakistani People's Party. She later became the chairperson of that party.\n\nBhutto became the first female head of an Islamic government in 1988. She served two nonconsecutive terms and enjoyed considerable popularity, but was targeted in an assassination attempt in 1995. In 2007, she was assassinated in a bombing.\n\nBhutto, often seen as a symbol of women's empowerment, paved the way for female political involvement in Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgathe Uwilingiyimana, prime minister of Rwanda, 1975\n\nAgathe Uwilingiyimana was born to farming parents but later became a professor of chemistry at the National University of Rwanda. After founding a self-help organization at her school, she earned the attention of the authorities, and became a director in the Ministry of Commerce in 1989.\n\nIn 1993, she became the first woman prime minister of Rwanda. She was assassinated the next year after the Rwandan genocide began.\n\nHer political career was short, but she remains influential as one of Africa's few female politicians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, 2005\n\nAngela Merkel, raised in East Germany, earned a doctorate in physical chemistry before she entered politics. She joined the growing democratic movement after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nShe rose through the ranks and was appointed chancellor in 2005. She's been described as a key player in managing the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the de facto leader of the EU.\n\nMerkel has been named the world's most powerful woman by Forbes nine times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia, 2006\n\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf is the current president of Liberia, and the first elected female head of state in Africa. She's also the first woman to chair the Economic Community of West African States.\n\nBorn to parents with impoverished backgrounds, Sirleaf has focused on education and health care.\n\nAlong with Leyman Gbowee of Liberia and Tawakkol Karman of Yemen, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for her work toward the safety of women and women's rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDilma Rousseff, president of Brazil, 2011\n\nDilma Rousseff, the current Brazilian president and the first woman to hold that office, is embroiled in an impeachment trial over charges of manipulating government accounts.\n\nBorn to an upper-middle-class family, Rousseff became a socialist and was captured, tortured, and imprisoned between 1970 and 1972, during the rule of Brazil's dictatorship. After her release, she reentered politics and became president in 2011.\n\nPrior to the controversies that brought on her impeachment, Rousseff was relatively popular, reducing a number of taxes.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
