        "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2016 and its second for the period 2019-2022.\n\nThe second WPS NAP of the Central African Republic is based on a number of documents and policies relating to WPS and gender; these included the report of the implementation of the first WPS NAP, analysis of national and international legal instruments for the protection of women against gender-based violence, the study of the organizational structure and functioning modalities of the National Observatory on Equality between men and women, the proposals of some civil society and the network of parliamentarian women of Central African Republic, the diagnosis of the discrimination against women in CAR, and the study on the magnitude and forms of gender-based violence during crisis. Furthermore, the government of CAR collected data from key stakeholders who could participate in the implementation of the second action plan, including political-administrative authorities, pertinent services, leaders of the CSOs, Communitary Assistance Organizations (OACs) and feminist organizations.\n\nThere are different challenges the government in CAR identified, including: The existence of discriminatory laws; Insufficient periodic reports on the implementation of international legal instruments; The persistence of insecurity in the country; Weak allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325; Lack of a grounded approach for gender-sensitive budgeting at the national and sectoral level; Lack of a national database of gender-based violence; Lack of a gender-sensitive Sectoral Strategy in the Defense and Security Forces; Insufficient synergy between the key stakeholders for the implementation of the NAP.\n\nThe 2019-2022 CAR NAP has strategic axes that structure the document: Reinforcement of conflict prevention measures in order to avoid the emergence of violent conflicts and consolidation of peace; Full and meaningful participation and strong leadership of women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security; Strengthening protection to promote and protect human rights, specifically those of women, in times of peace, in times of conflict, and at all stages of conflict resolution; Recovery and transitional justice so that the specific needs of women and girls are guaranteed in all reconstruction processes in conflict or post-conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable (displaced and/or refugee women and girls, survivors of gender-based violence, women and girls with disabilities); Strengthening protection and security in the face of new human security threats.\n\nThe Central African Republic reported on its WPS implementation in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020).\n\nThe Central African Republic gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in the history of the CAR is its ongoing civil war, which started in 2012. The conflict has displaced thousands of people and left millions in need of humanitarian aid. In 2014, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) to ensure peace and stability in the country. Nevertheless, there have been several allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in the CAR.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe government of the Central African Republic presented the first draft of the second NAP, finalizing and approving it under the leadership of the Ministry for the Promotion of Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child, with the financial and technical support of UN Women.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe Ministry for the Promotion of Women, of the Family, and the Protection of the Child is responsible for the coordination of the implementation of the NAP, in partnership with UN Women, and in collaboration with other UN agencies including international NGOs working on the WPS agenda. The Action Plan recommends the creation of a Technical Secretariat to support the implementation.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be made by a Technical Committee, composed of:\n\nThe National Technical Comittee for the fight against gender-based violence, harmful traditional practices and child marriage\n\nThe Equality Observatory\n\nThe Local Committees for Peace\n\nThe National Forum recommendation follow-up committee\n\nThe National Mediation Council\n\nThe Commission for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation\n\nLocal focal points\n\nCivil Society\n\nThe National Action Plan notes the role CSOs play in the implementation of the NAP, and identifies a need to collaborate with all organizations working with the WPS agenda. The NAP intends to train and help CSOs to develop leadership and increase women’s participation in all levels of political life, and sees them as a key source for data and information.\n\nAll the actions on the Central African Action Plan are structured around the axes of the document. Examples of the enlisted actions are below.\n\n1.1 Sensitize the members of the Government and national top executives on UNSCR 1325 and national and international legal instruments on human rights, as well as on the need to promote policies that reinforce the protection of women and girls.\n\n1.5 Promote dialogue among all the signatories of the Peace and Reconciliation Accords by calling on them to put an end to violence in all forms.\n\n2.2 Review discriminatory laws that prevent the promotion of women’s rights.\n\n2.11 Train women leaders on conflict resolution, mediation and peace consolidation.\n\n3.6 Ensure the implementation of holistic care for women and girls, and men and boys who are survivors of sexual violence.\n\n4.3 Implement a reparations system for victims of sexual and gender-based violence during conflict.\n\n5.6 Include women in the fight against climate change\n\nActors\n\nNAP Development\n\nThe NAP mentions that civil society was involved in every stage of drafting the National Action Plan. They contributed to the preliminary analysis of the topics and challenges to be addressed in the NAP. They were consulted to review the initial draft suggested by experts via workshops organised all over the country.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Affairs, National Solidarity and Gender Promotion are in charge of the development of the NAP. To be noted, BINUCA, which is the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic, was also involved in drafting the NAP.\n\nNAP Implementation\n\nThe NAP mentions that civil society will be part of the implementation phase as a collaborating group of the Sector Committee for Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction. It is not quoted as taking part in the implementation process on an independent basis.\n\nThe Ministries of Social Affairs, National Solidarity and Gender Promotion are in charge of implementing the strategies and programs for protection and promotion of women’s rights.\n\nThe Sector Committee for Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction, created to ensure a smooth coordination between programs and projects related to gender equality, will also be responsible for the implementation of the NAP. In order to prevent the ever-increasing number of institutions related to gender issues, its capacities will be strengthened. It will therefore be comprised of representatives from the Ministries of Defence, Public Security, Justice, Health, Communications, Finance and Social Affairs, technical and financial partners as well as civil society organizations and private sector organizations.\n\nNAP Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe NAP mentions that civil society will be part of the monitoring phase as a collaborating group of the Sector Committee for Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction. It is not quoted as taking part in the monitoring process on an independent basis.\n\nSeveral bodies will be charge of monitoring the implementation of the NAP. The Ministers of Social Affairs, National Solidarity and Gender Promotion are in charge of monitoring the implementation of the plan. The Monitoring Committee of the CEDAW will also be part of the monitoring process for the implementation of the Convention on a national level. It will deliver a report, together with all national actors, accordingly. The Sector Committee for Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction will also be involved in the monitoring phase.\n\nTimeframe\n\nThe Central African Republic NAP covers the period 2014 inclusive of 2016. For each axis, a table displays the timeframe for the implementation of each activity.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe National Action Plan is composed of 5 “Strategic Priority Axis”:\n\nEnhancing national actors’ and people’s awareness of UNSCR 1325 and other international instruments that protect women’s rights with the intention of mobilizing societies to stand up for protecting civilian populations during conflicts and for involving women in peace processes\n\nStrengthening violence and conflict prevention as well as civilian populations’ protection\n\nStrengthening women’s participation and representation in all levels of decision-making processes related to conflict prevention response and resolution\n\nStrengthening civilian populations’ protection against violence and better reintegrating victims from sexual-based violence during conflicts in the society.\n\nStrengthening coordination and monitoring processes\n\nActions/Activities\n\nEach Strategic Priority Axis implies specific objectives as well as clear actions to achieve this result. For instance, the first strategic priority axis, “Enhancing national actors’ and people’s awareness of UNSCR 1325 and other international instruments that protect women’s rights with the intention of mobilizing societies to stand up for protecting civilian populations during conflicts and for involving women in peace processes” relies on the following set of activities:\n\nTrain decision makers on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights\n\nTrain employees of UN agencies and financial and technical partners on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights\n\nOrganize trainings on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights for soldiers and policemen at all levels\n\nOrganize trainings on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights for actors in the legal and judicial sector (judges, lawyers, officers of the judicial police, members of the prison administration) at all levels.\n\nOrganize trainings on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights for NGOs’ management at all levels\n\nBrief population and local actors on women’s role in peace processes, development and national reconciliation\n\nTranslate UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights in the national language\n\nOrganize media campaigns on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights on centralized and decentralized levels\n\nIndicators\n\nFor each axis and underlying activities, indicators have been clearly defined.\n\nFor instance, for the eight activities underlying the first axis “Enhancing national actors’ and people’s awareness of UNSCR 1325 and other international instruments that protect women’s rights with the intention of mobilizing societies to stand up for protecting civilian populations during conflicts and for involving women in peace processes”, the following indicators are mentioned:\n\nNumber of decision makers trained on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights\n\nNumber of employees of UN agencies and financial and technical partners trained on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights\n\nNumber of employees trained on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights in each body\n\nNumber of people trained on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights in the judicial and legal sector\n\nNumber of people trained on UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights amongst NGOs’ management\n\nPercentage of the population favourable to women’s involvement in peace and reconstruction processes\n\nNumber of legal text translation copies in the national language distributed to the population\n\nNumber of people who understand the legal content of UNSCR 1325 and other legal instruments related to women’s rights on centralized and decentralized levels.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe NAP dedicates a full axis to monitoring and implementation processes. It relies on a set of activities and for each activity an expected result as well as responsible bodies for achieving the result are clearly defined.\n\nBudget\n\nThe total budget for implementing this NAP is $8.2 mln, split as following: $4.0 mln in 2014, $2.4 mln in 2015 and $1.7 mln in 2016.\n\nDisarmament\n\nThe Central African Republic NAP discusses plans of action for disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating female ex-soldiers in society but it is not explicit in recommendations."
