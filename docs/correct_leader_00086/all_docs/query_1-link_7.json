        "text": "In 1995 Nelson Mandela and over 1,000 other political prisoners held a reunion on Robben Island where they had been incarcerated for so many years. They visited to the lime mine where they had been forced to work, but that also provided a place where they could secretly meet to educate each other. If you ever visited the island you will probably have been told the story. They followed an old African tradition: when on a very long journey, from time to time the person would stop and place a stone as a marker of where they have come from and where they are going. Outside the entrance to the lime mine there is a pile of stones that these former prisoners placed there to mark how far they had come and to look forward to the future.\n\nRecently I attended the Leadership Summit for Women in Energy and Resources held in Brisbane. I had the privilege of being one of the speakers and facilitating a one-day workshop that gave me the opportunity to get to meet many of the delegates. The room was full of confident, capable women who wanted to learn and put into practice all the tips and ideas they could glean from the exceptional collection of speakers.\n\nOver the Summit we heard stories of the challenges people had faced through their careers, the blatant discrimination contrasted with women who had managed to juggle life to balance family and career and get to the top. Everyone was buzzing with the inspiring stories and practical ideas they were taking away.\n\nI was chatting to two of the delegates at the end of the conference and it struck me that it was a good time to place down a stone in the journey of equality in the workplace. It is a long journey and we have been making progress. We are currently in a season where many of the heads of countries are women and Hilary Clinton is in the final run for President of the United States. But we have not got this far overnight. Below are some of the key milestones that I am aware of from my UK/Aussie worldview.\n\n1849 - Elizabeth Blackwell became the 1st woman to be given a medical degree\n\nLate 1800’s - Women start to win the right to vote in with New Zealand and South Australia leading the way. The UK granted full rights in 1928 and aboriginal women finally getting the vote as recently as 1962.\n\n1911 - Madame Curie was awarded the Nobel Peace prize as a scientist for the 1st time. She is the only person to win twice in multiple sciences.\n\nWWII - Women were needed to do “men’s” work for the war effort; they demonstrated they could do everything from agriculture to engineering. Unfortunately they were often then dismissed after the war.\n\n1953 - The movie Project Moonbase had the President of the United States played by actress Ernestine Barrier.\n\n1961 - The contraceptive pill was introduced, giving women the opportunity to have control over the timing and frequency of their pregnancies.\n\n1960’s - Women started protesting for women’s rights by burning their bras.\n\n1966 - Married women were allowed to work, instead of being required to choose between work and marriage.\n\n1970’s - Women were allowed to open a bank account without their husband’s permission.\n\n1979 - Margaret Thatcher was elected as Prime Minister of UK. There had been few other female national leaders to this point: Israel’s Golda Meir, Argentina’s Eva Perron, India’s Indira Ghandi, Khertek Anchimaa-Toka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Ceylon / Sri Lanka, Elisabeth Domitien of the Central African Republic with President of People's Republic of Tannu Tuva as early as 1940.\n\n1970’s - Girls were allowed to choose to learn metalwork, technical drawing and woodwork and boys were allowed to choose to learn home economics.\n\n1986 - “Charlene” from neighbours was one of the early characters depicted in prime time TV in the traditionally male role of a mechanic.\n\n1986 - One of the women I worked with in one of the top accounting firms in the world was given permission to wear trousers to work.\n\nAnd where the stone is placed, in addition to looking back at where we have come from, we should look at where we are and where we still have to go:\n\nIn some countries women, and some men, do not have full voting rights (1).\n\nMany women in the world do not have access to contraception that they control (2).\n\nWomen are still under-represented in many industries, in senior management and on Boards (3).\n\nMany women are paid less than their peers and take longer to get promoted (4).\n\nSome women still feel they have to hide the fact that they are pregnant for as long as possible because of the risk of prejudice (5). There are even websites that give tips on how to hide your pregnancy.\n\nWomen are still facing unconscious bias and out-right prejudice in the workplace as told by story after story at the Summit.\n\nThe women at the Summit acknowledged that many men had supported their careers and that men are an important part of the solution. They did not just focus on the challenges they face, but also took time to consider the difficulties faced by other groups on the grounds of colour, religion and sexual preference.\n\nI am sure I have missed many of our breakthroughs as well as many of the challenges still faced by women; if you know of any others then why not add them in as comments.\n\nMy thanks go to all the women who came to the conference, determined to look to be the best they can be in their chosen field, their companies who funded them to attend, Liquid Learning for running the conference, all the people who have paved the way to get us where we are today and to everyone out there who endeavours to make the workplace a fairer place to be.\n\nReferences accessed 23.10.2016\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage#Timeline\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/melinda_gates_let_s_put_birth_control_back_on_the_agenda/transcript?language=en\n\nhttps://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Stats_at_a_Glance.pdf\n\nhttps://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/pay-equity-leaders\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/comment/workplace-discrimination-begins-at-pregnancy-20140407-zqrpl.html\n\nSince 2006 Claire has been coaching Executives, Business Owners, Senior and Middle Managers to hone their strengths and overcome their frustrations.
