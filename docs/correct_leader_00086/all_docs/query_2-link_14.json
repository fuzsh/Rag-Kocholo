        "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR), a landlocked country in the center of Africa, possesses abundant natural and mineral resources such as gold, diamonds, uranium, phosphates, nickel, cobalt, copper and coltan. However, despite these resources, the country remains one of the poorest and most fragile in the world. Historically, weak governance and public institutions have failed to adequately provide basic services to the population. Power is primarily concentrated in the capital city of Bangui and poorly controlled, porous borders have allowed rebel movements and armed groups to proliferate in large parts of the country.\n\nThe crisis in 2013 marked a significant turning point for the CAR when a rebel alliance called the Séléka overthrew then-President François Bozizé, plunging the country into a severe crisis. The rebels committed numerous abuses against civilians, while loosely organized self-defense groups known as the Anti-Balaka fought the rebels, but also targeted Muslim civilians. The level of violence during this period far surpassed the instability witnessed in previous decades. When Faustin-Archange Touadéra assumed power in 2016, the country was in a state of devastation, with two-thirds of the territory outside government control and the already weak economy further contracted.\n\nThus, the period from January 2021 to January 2023 represents a critical juncture for the CAR for several reasons. The period began with a new upheaval following presidential and legislative elections held on December 27, 2020. These elections were conducted under tumultuous conditions as former President François Bozizé was barred from running, due to being prosecuted for war crimes and facing U.N. sanctions. In response, an armed group alliance called the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC) launched a rebellion in December 2020, seeking to capture major towns and the capital. Although the elections proceeded as planned, some polling stations remained closed and many voters did not participate due to intimidation.\n\nThe first half of 2021 witnessed the government’s efforts to push back against the CPC and regain control of the occupied territories. A state of emergency was imposed between January and August 2021. To counter rebel movements, the government changed its strategy entirely and sought new allies, finding support from Rwanda and Russia. In addition to assistance provided by the UN’s Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the CAR forces received help from Rwandan troops and mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group. In a counteroffensive, Wagner and the army were able to recapture most of the country’s territory, albeit at the cost of significant civilian casualties. Wagner troops are currently deployed throughout the country, with the Russian Embassy in Bangui reporting the presence of 1,890 “instructors” from the Wagner Group in the CAR in January 2023.\n\nIn response to the CAR’s close ties with Russia, France withdrew its military presence from the country, with the last French soldiers leaving in December 2022. Moreover, traditional Western partners and donors have partially frozen or delayed their budget support, demanding greater transparency in security-related spending.\n\nOn September 16, 2021, under the auspices of Rwanda and Angola, the CAR government and the heads of state of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) adopted the Luanda Roadmap. In line with this road map, the president declared a unilateral cease-fire on October 15, 2021, and a republic-wide dialogue was organized in Bangui from March 21 to 27, 2022. However, the CPC was excluded from this dialogue, leading to a general boycott by the main opposition leaders. In the following months, clashes between the national army, supported by Russian mercenaries, and CPC forces persisted in several parts of the country, despite the cease-fire. Although the intensity of the violence has decreased, there have been reports of serious human rights violations by both sides and Russian forces.\n\nFrom a humanitarian perspective, the situation remains tense, with many people forced to flee their homes over the past decade. As of early 2023, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 3.4 million people in the CAR required humanitarian assistance and protection, which is over half of the total population of 5.4 million. This represents a 10% increase compared to the previous year. Violence has affected all 16 prefectures. A wide range of human rights violations have been reported, resulting in the displacement of thousands of people. By November 2022, there were over 744,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from the CAR in neighboring countries, primarily Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of the Congo, according to UNHCR. This number increased compared to December 2020 (590,911) and December 2021 (630,132). Additionally, there were 509,000 internally displaced persons, a decrease from January 2022 (691,791) and January 2021 (681,913).\n\nEconomically, the country continues to suffer from the 2013 crisis and was further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAR’s economy heavily relies on exporting natural resources, primarily timber, gold, diamonds and copper, to countries outside of Africa, notably China and EU countries. This heavy dependence on a narrow range of exports makes the CAR’s economy particularly vulnerable. While the economy has not yet recovered from the decline in global exports due to the pandemic, it now faces the challenge of skyrocketing fuel prices. Additionally, the reluctance of some donors to provide continuous budget support poses a growing risk, considering the significant contribution that international donors used to make to the state budget.\n\nThe post-independence history of the Central African Republic (CAR) has been marked by cycles of violence and chronic political instability. Since gaining independence, the CAR has witnessed five successful coups d’état and several attempted ones. Since 2016, it has been governed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra, who first came to power through presidential elections in 2016 and was re-elected in December 2020.\n\nFor the first 30 years after independence, France played a role in manipulating or facilitating changes in executive office. General Jean-Bédel Bokassa seized control from David Dacko in a coup d’état in 1965, declaring himself president for life and later emperor. Bokassa’s regime was marked by violent repression, but the economy appeared to thrive as infrastructure was built. When France grew weary of Bokassa’s excesses, David Dacko was “restored” to the presidency in 1979. However, another coup in the same year brought General André Kolingba to power, leading to a rapid economic decline and widespread salary arrears. By the end of the decade, international aid was conditioned on democratic progress, resulting in elections that led to Ange-Félix Patassé assuming power. Patassé, the first northerner to hold executive power in the CAR, faced challenges in reforming a mono-ethnic, defiant army, which ultimately mutinied. The repressive response to these mutinies laid the groundwork for the current instability in the CAR. By the mid-1990s, civil conflict had escalated into organized rebellion, accompanied by attempted coups and interference from neighboring countries. Chadian soldiers overwhelmingly supported François Bozizé’s violent takeover, committing severe human rights violations. Rebels from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, called upon by Patassé to defend his presidency, also contributed to the crimes. These events reinforced the population’s mistrust of foreigners and the government.\n\nIn the 2005 presidential elections, Bozizé won with 64.6% of the vote. Throughout his decade-long rule, structural problems persisted, and serious security issues arose. Major rebellions emerged in the north of the country, followed by peace efforts and state-building initiatives that the government and rebel parties often manipulated to reap advantages.\n\nIn 2011, despite significant misconduct and rigging, international partners remained quiet when Bozizé won the election. In late 2012, a broad alliance of rebel groups known as Séléka formed in the predominantly Muslim northeast, including fighters from Chad and Sudan. They captured Bangui in March 2013 and installed Michel Djotodia as the country’s first Muslim president. Djotodia’s Séléka committed ruthless acts of rape, murder and violence against civilians in Bangui and across the country. In response, self-defense groups called Anti-Balaka and former security forces carried out brutal revenge killings, often targeting Muslims of Arab descent. The violence during this time had a devastating impact on the CAR’s fragile economy, leading to a sharp decline in the Human Development Index and a 37% shrinkage of the economy. More than 800,000 people were displaced. Djotodia was forced to step down in January 2014, and an interim president, Catherine Samba-Panza, was appointed. During this transition period, a new constitution was approved, and peaceful elections were held.\n\nIn February 2016, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, an independent presidential candidate, won the general elections with 63% of the vote. Unfortunately, violence and displacement persisted throughout 2017 and 2018, even in previously stable areas. U.N. peacekeeping missions played a central role in maintaining law and order. By the end of 2018, one in five Central Africans had been displaced.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, armed groups driven by criminal, economic or political interests continued to assert control over the country. These groups included Anti-Balaka militias, the Union for Peace (UPC), the Popular Front for the Renaissance of Central Africa (FPRC), the Democratic Front of the Central African People (FDPC), Révolution and Justice (RJ), and multiple former Séléka factions.\n\nIn 2019, François Bozizé returned to the CAR and announced his intention to run in the December 2020 presidential elections. However, the Constitutional Court disqualified him due to war crime charges and U.N. sanctions. Just before the elections, the CPC alliance of rebel movements took control of major cities. Despite some polling stations being unable to open, the elections were held as scheduled. Touadéra was declared the winner, securing more than 53% of the vote, but with only around one-third of eligible citizens participating. On January 13, 2021, the CPC launched an assault on Bangui but was repelled by the Central African military forces (FACA) with support from international allies, including the U.N. operation, MINUSCA, Rwandese troops, and mercenaries from the Wagner group. While Touadéra’s popularity increased after the counter-attacks in 2021, his rapprochement with Russia created a rift between Bangui and traditional partners, particularly France. Following a state of emergency between January and August 2021, the government agreed to the Luanda Roadmap, mediated by Rwanda and Angola, and endorsed by the heads of state of the ICGLR. As part of this road map, Touadéra declared a unilateral cease-fire on October 15, 2021, and organized a republic-wide dialogue in March 2022, which did not include representatives from the CPC coalition.\n\nIn the CAR, the existence of a state monopoly on the legitimate use of force has been rare. The authority and control of the state are mainly concentrated in the capital, Bangui, while the government has little power in other parts of the country. The national borders are also largely uncontrolled and vulnerable to entry by armed groups from neighboring countries. As a result, rebel movements and militias have established rule and governance where the state is absent.\n\nThe Central African Armed Forces (FACA) have traditionally been weak and faced significant challenges in terms of resources, human capital and logistics. They heavily rely on external support for funding, materials and training, with France being a major source of support for many years. Multinational operations led by regional communities (CEMAC and CEEAC), France or the United Nations have been deployed to the CAR since 1997. In recent years, the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, has increasingly provided military support to the CAR government under an agreement signed in 2018, which includes mineral concessions as part of the exchange. The activities of Wagner mercenaries became more apparent after the incidents during the presidential and legislative elections in December 2020. Following the rejection of former President François Bozizé’s candidacy, major armed groups formed the Coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), with Bozizé declaring himself as the coalition’s leader. CPC-affiliated militias and movements were able to seize territories in various regions of the country. To reclaim these territories, Wagner mercenaries were deployed and joined operations with FACA, MINUSCA and Rwandan troops. With their assistance, more than 20 towns and villages were reclaimed from the rebel groups and the CPC’s attempt to seize Bangui in January 2021 was halted, largely due to the operations led by Wagner mercenaries. Over the following months, the Wagner Group shifted its role from primarily support and training to active interventions in confrontations with rebel movements in the country. By April 2021, most rebel strongholds had been reached and recovered and major roads were once again under control. However, it became apparent that Wagner mercenaries were increasingly acting independently of the CAR government, although they continued to support FACA with training and coordination. As of January 2023, according to the Russian Embassy in Bangui, there were 1,890 Wagner instructors in the CAR.\n\nThe recovery of significant parts of the territory and restored control over roads have increased the popularity of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, now seen as a strong leader. Although the military operations in 2021 led to a strong crackdown on rebel movements that had previously controlled two-thirds of the country, it is difficult to determine whether the state has fully reestablished a monopoly on the use of force. These military operations relied heavily on foreign support and it remains uncertain to what extent the state will be able to maintain the current situation. Of particular concern are the abuses committed by Wagner mercenaries and state forces against civilians.\n\nIn terms of political changes, the CAR is characterized by a succession of democratic changeovers and coups d’état. The first democratic elections being held in 1992 did not mean that the period of violent transitions of power had ended.\n\nThe current president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, came to power in the first elections after the 2013 crisis and a transition period under interim President Catherine Samba-Panza. He was re-elected in December 2020. The presidential elections received international attention when the Constitutional Court rejected the candidacy of former President François Bozizé. The court justified its decision by arguing that Bozizé did not satisfy the “good morality” requirement for candidates, due to an international warrant for his arrest and U.N. sanctions against him for alleged assassinations, torture and other crimes. Bozizé thus did not meet the requirements to run for president, according to the court. This triggered a new wave of unrest: several rebel movements formed a coalition and launched an offensive with a view to preventing the elections from taking place. The CPC attacked major towns, such as Bambari and Bangasso, which led to a series of battles. Supported by MINUSCA and Rwandan and Wagner Group soldiers, the CAR’s armed forces managed to push back the rebels and prevented them from entering Bangui. However, with rising insecurity in many parts of the country and the CPC’s ongoing attacks on several cities, the elections were held under very difficult circumstances since 14% of polling stations were closed; in 29 out of 71 sous-préfectures, no voting took place, and in six sous-préfectures, polling stations had to close early due to voter intimidation. Nevertheless, the national election authority (ANE) reported a participation rate of 76.31%, counting only registered voters in polling stations where voting took place which accounts for 910,000 out of a total of 1.8 million registered voters. The Constitutional Court declared Touadéra winner with 53.92% of the vote in the first round. The Constitutional Court partially invalidated the preliminary results of the simultaneous legislative elections, raising doubts about the integrity and fairness of the process. The international community acknowledged the elections’ results. The opposition contested them, arguing that 70% of voters were prevented from voting due to the tense security climate and complaining of massive fraud, the opposition contested the election results. Given the security situation, while existing on paper, elements of free and fair elections such as universal suffrage and equal media access are not fully guaranteed.\n\nSince independence in 1960 (and with a brief interruption between 1976 and 1979 during the empire established by Jean-Bédel Bokassa), the CAR has had a presidential system. The current constitution has been in place since 2015 and continues to ensure the separation of powers. It even includes the addition of an upper house of parliament (the Senate), which could further strengthen the state’s legislative functions. The Senate has, however, still not been established. There is no tradition of political checks and balances in the CAR. The president is not used to having a parliament that independently questions the administration’s actions.\n\nIn addition, the separation of powers has frequently been challenged during states of emergency. The most recent one was declared on January 21, 2021 in the context of fighting the CPC. It was only lifted in August 2021.\n\nDuring these six months, the police were able to enter private homes, conduct house searches and arrest individuals without going through the normal legal process and without prior authorization from the public prosecutor.\n\nDespite the constant problem of a shortage of judges, prosecutors and lawyers, as well as resources, the Constitutional Court has repeatedly attempted to play a more prominent role in government than it has in the past and to demonstrate its ability to perform oversight and checks and balances – with and without success. In spring 2020, for instance, the court stopped the president’s plans to postpone the elections because of the pandemic. Again, in September 2022, the Constitutional Court decided to block the president’s constitutional reform to allow him to run for a third term in 2025, calling it unconstitutional. In addition, the court requested that the Senate, outlined in the 2015 constitution, should first be established. The government responded by ordering the retirement by the end of 2022 of the court’s president, Danielle Darlan, aged 70. Although Darlan refused, her appointment in 2017 was revoked by a decree citing a “permanent impediment.”\n\nThere was a one-party system in the first decades after independence. A multiparty system was introduced in 1991 with a law on political parties was passed in July of that year. A decree signed in 2005 further regulated, albeit rather insufficiently, the status of political parties in the country.\n\nThe number of political parties was considerably high, and the party system unstable and not based on ideological differences. Thus, fragmentation is relatively high, institutionalization very low (including high voter volatility) and ideological polarization hardly exists.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Territorial Administration, in 2019, there were more than 90 political parties in the Central African Republic. The president’s party, the United Hearts Movement, was only founded in 2018. Generally, political parties seem to be more the private appendages of opportunistic politicians seeking clientelistic networks for personal entitlement than a plurality of representatives of the population. Indeed, civilian political parties have never been particularly robust due to their own lack of capacity. No civilian party has been able to represent the interests of marginalized minorities, and most suffered severe internal crises. Traditional institutions representing distinct populations were repeatedly destroyed during colonial and post-colonial times. Under President Touadéra, several initiatives have been taken in order to better regulate the party system in the country. As one of the requirements of the Khartoum Agreement from February 2019, the National Assembly passed a new law on political parties and the status of the opposition in February 2020. In order to avoid the plethoric formation of political parties as in the past, the law states that parties need to obtain at least 5% of the votes in legislative or municipal elections in order to remain in existence. In addition, parties have to maintain accounts. The opposition welcomed the new law as a means to better define and regulate the rights and obligations of political parties. The government passed an additional decree in November 2020, setting out conditions to grant state subsidies to political parties. Among these conditions, political parties’ accounts have to be subject to control by an authorized body. As an incentive to increase women’s involvement in politics, 15% of subsidies are allocated to political parties whose female members are elected to parliament and 10% to parties with women on municipal councils.\n\nAll relevant indicators of socioeconomic development in the CAR are at very low levels, which means that the country consistently ranks among the world’s 10 worst performers. According to the September 2022 release of the Human Development Index (HDI 2021), the CAR was ranked 188th out of 191 countries, the same rank as in 2019 and 2017 (the CAR was ranked 187th out of 188 in 2015). The index score of 0.404 in 2021 represented a second year of decline from 0.411 in 2019, before the pandemic impacted the country’s economy and a security crisis in the first half of 2021 interrupted the CAR’s main road for International trade. The current HDI score is only slightly higher than the levels in 2012 (HDI 0.388), prior to the Séléka rebellion and the ensuing violence of 2013.\n\nPoverty remains pervasive and structural in the CAR. GDP per capita (PPP, constant 2017 international $) was $838 in 2021, slightly lower than $848 and $862 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Despite some recovery from the 2013 crisis, is stagnant level remains below the $1,209 (PPP, constant 2017 international $) reached in 2012 before the breakdown of political order that left the economy in ruins.\n\nAccording to World Bank calculations, the share of the population living below the international poverty line ($2.15/day in PPP, constant 2017 international $) has remained around 70% with no signs of improvement in recent years. These figures are based on empirical data from 2008 and should be interpreted with caution as the effects of the 2013 crisis are likely underestimated. More recent survey data from 2018/2019 from the UNDP Multidimensional Poverty Index 2022 shows that over 55% of the population lives in severe multidimensional poverty, the fifth highest rate among all countries reviewed since 2010.\n\nIn general, urban residents, especially those in Bangui, have historically fared better than people in rural areas. Although there is limited recent empirical data on economic inequality (income and property), it is evident that inequality remains high. There is little reason to think that the CAR’s Gini coefficient for income has improved since its last evaluation in 2008, when the CAR had a Gini coefficient of 56.3, placing it among the most unequal countries in the world. Women also face significant exclusion from economic opportunities, as indicated by the Gender Inequality Index of 0.672 in 2021.\n\nThe fragile security environment in the CAR has improved since the failed attempts by armed groups to seize power in Bangui at the beginning of 2021. This temporarily disrupted the vital Douala-Bangui corridor responsible for 80% of external trade. The temporary closure of the RN3 Highway in early 2021 resulted in inflation, which eased after the road reopened. However, the country experienced another price shock due to rising food and fuel prices on the world market.\n\nThe poor condition of and slow improvements in the national road network continue to hinder the recovery of the country’s fragile economy, despite the state’s increase in control over its territory, which has removed the main obstacle to increased market participation beyond the capital region.\n\nExcept for urban centers and certain mining areas, the CAR’s economy remains largely informal, although there are no reliable quantitative estimates on the share of the formal and informal sectors. According to the FAO, the subsistence economy provided a livelihood for nearly 75% of the population in 2019.\n\nUrban centers, especially Bangui, are witnessing increased market-based competition, particularly in sectors catering to the international community, such as real estate services, restaurants and other service industries.\n\nAccording to FAO estimates, the country’s forestry resources cover around 22.3 million hectares, accounting for approximately 36% of its territory. The exploitation of some of these resources, which encompass various species, accounted for over 60% of the country’s total export earnings in 2021. Additionally, the CAR possesses significant mineral resources, including gold and gemstones (particularly diamonds), which constitute about a quarter of its exports. Other minerals with significant economic potential include uranium, iron and copper. While these resources remain largely untapped, there has been an increase in copper extraction in the past two years. Gold and diamond mining are predominantly carried out by a partially unregulated artisanal sector. Diamond exports increased following the regional lifting of restrictions imposed through the Kimberley Process. In partnership with the IMF, the government has continued fiscal reforms that were interrupted by the 2013 coup and subsequent conflicts.\n\nIn its latest review of the CAR’s performance, the IMF noted that international donors have postponed the disbursement of budget support, seeking greater transparency in the government’s security-related spending. Donor reluctance and scrutiny can be seen as spillovers from global geopolitical tensions. This poses significant fiscal and social risks considering the country’s heavy reliance on budget support. The sharp deterioration in trade observed in 2022, driven by food and fuel price shocks, exposed existing vulnerabilities and further limited policy options.\n\nIn January 2023, the IMF completed its Article IV Mission to the Central African Republic. As a preliminary finding, the IMF observed that the post-COVID-19 recovery has been severely disrupted by fuel shortages and the soaring food prices throughout 2022. The ongoing food crisis has worsened, requiring immediate humanitarian and budgetary assistance. Given potential spillovers from the geopolitical tensions surrounding the war in Ukraine, the CAR’s political options appear increasingly precarious.\n\nReliable, up-to-date information on the banking sector in the CAR is scarce in the public domain. According to World Bank data, the bank capital-to-assets ratio remained relatively stable at around 14% in 2021 compared to 2020. The percentage of non-performing loans has shown a positive trend, declining from over 30% in 2015 to 16.1% in 2019, and further dropping to 13.9% in 2021, approaching pre-2013 levels.\n\nThe CAR’s membership in CEMAC and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) anchors the country to international banking standards, despite its small economy. However, the CAR has the smallest financial sector in the entire CEMAC region and the weakest ratio of population to bank counters in Central Africa. Banks are mainly concentrated in Bangui, with some presence in Berbérati and Bouar. Currently, there are four commercial banks (Ecobank, CBCA, BSIC and BPMC) and at least two active microfinance institutes. The Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) serves as the central bank for the six countries in the CEMAC community. The common currency and monetary policy of the BEAC remain linked to the euro and the Banque de France, but there are growing reservations across the region, including in the CAR, about this. The banking sector is theoretically well-regulated under the supervision of the Commission Bancaire de l’Afrique Centrale (COBAC), which is associated with the BEAC. However, the market is poorly differentiated and offers limited opportunities for domestic investors.\n\nIn early 2022, the Touadéra government introduced a bill that was unanimously adopted in parliament, making bitcoin a legal tender in the CAR. This move was surprising, considering the relatively low internet access rate, just above 10%, and questions persist about its compatibility with CEMAC requirements. President Touadéra has since developed ambitious plans to establish a national blockchain-based currency called the Sango, although public listing of the coin has been postponed. Nonetheless, the government continues to pursue its goal of creating favorable conditions for blockchain-related financial services.\n\nThe budgetary situation in 2021 worsened due to a decline in government revenue caused by trade interruptions and the postponement of budgetary support from donors. This was a result of post-election political tensions and concerns over transparency in security spending. However, prudent government spending and postponements to infrastructure investments helped stabilize the budgetary situation. Despite improvements expected by the IMF for 2022 and 2023, a fuel and food crisis in 2022 undermined progress. The IMF was expected to grant an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) by the end of 2022. This would encourage financing from other donors and multilateral partners. In recent years, international donor grants have accounted for around 8% of GDP or nearly 50% of total government revenue. The public debt burden is projected to remain stable, with the external share accounting for 70% and mainly held by multilateral and bilateral creditors. The non-disbursement of planned budget support and increased import prices have contributed to an increased current account deficit, which is expected to narrow in 2023 with increased exports.\n\nThe country’s public finances continue to face deficits due to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, road interruptions in 2021, and food and fuel price increases. Furthermore, the escalating conflict in Ukraine has led to increased scrutiny from international donors, requiring the government to demonstrate improvements in fiscal management and progress in implementing the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding. The government has taken steps to repay arrears to small and medium-sized enterprises and reduce domestic arrears to pension funds. However, without donor contributions, the fiscal deficit of the state budget remains at unsustainable levels. Even with budgetary support, the deficit has widened from 3.4% in 2020 to 6.0% in 2021 and is estimated to remain at 5.7% in 2022 due to growing reluctance in donor support. The overall public debt reached 47.6% of GDP in 2021 and is projected to increase to 54.8% in 2022, breaking the previous downward trend observed from 2017 to 2020 when the public debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from over 50% to 43.4%.\n\nGiven the limited tax base of the state (less than 9% of GDP), there are minimal financial resources available to build and develop widespread social safety nets. Improvements in territorial control and progress in containing armed groups since 2021 have improved conditions for NGOs’ work and revitalized community self-help as a traditional form of social support in rural areas. However, formal and informal self-help mechanisms were destroyed during the 2013 crisis and remain weak in the CAR, due to the lack of social capital within and between social groups. Church organizations currently serve as the strongest social safety net in rural regions, providing care for the elderly, education, health care, and promoting entrepreneurial activities.\n\nEstimates suggest that, in 2022, more than half of the country’s population, around 3.1 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance. The CAR government and the OCHA have officially launched a $461.3 million Humanitarian Response Plan for 2022. Rising global food and energy prices exacerbate the hardships of vulnerable groups and displaced persons.\n\nAverage life expectancy at birth has steadily increased over the past two decades, reaching 54.02 years in 2022, a 0.63% increase from 53.35 years in 2021 (and up from 50.7 years in 2015 and 44.6 years in 2003). The Touadéra government has made efforts to reduce the country’s high maternal mortality rate, as well as neonatal and child mortality rates. While international donors supported the CAR’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is declining interest in the CAR to receive further vaccine donations through the COVAX Initiative. With just over one hundred COVID-19-related deaths, the CAR has managed to navigate through three main waves of the pandemic relatively unscathed. However, the death toll from malaria quadrupled between 2014 and 2017 and malaria continues to account for 40% of reported illnesses and 10% of all registered deaths. The surge in international funding for the CAR after the 2013 crisis resulted in a proliferation of NGOs on the ground, but there has been no sustained improvement in access to social safety nets.\n\nThe constitution of the CAR reaffirms the country’s commitment to preventing all forms of discrimination against women, indigenous people and tribal groups. It guarantees equality based on various factors such as race, ethnic origin, region, sex, religion, political affiliation and social position. However, similar to many legal provisions in the CAR, enforcement remains challenging.\n\nIn 2021, women constituted 44.8% of the labor force. Data on the gender pay gap are not available. However, due to lower female literacy rates among the working-age population, women face significant disadvantages in the labor market and the overall economy.\n\nAccording to UNESCO’s report in 2020, the adult literacy rate among women was 25.76%, showing a marginal improvement of 1.76 percentage points over the past 10 years. In comparison, the overall literacy rate in the country was 37.4%, with a rate of 49.5% for men in 2018.\n\nThe UNDP Gender Inequality Index also places the CAR at the bottom of its list, ranking 166th out of 170 indexed countries, with a score of 0.672 in 2021. This represents a slight improvement from 0.701 in 2016, which coincided with the first elections after the 2013 crisis that brought the Touadéra government into office.\n\nWhile women accounted for 20% of the Conseil National de Transition (CNT), and a woman served as interim president from 2014 to 2016, the representation of women in the National Assembly elected in 2016 (installed in May 2016) dropped to 8.5%, lower than in Chad, Sudan, South Sudan and Cameroon. The 2021 elections slightly increased the share of women in the National Assembly to 13%.\n\nDespite women holding key government positions since 2016, including minister of defense and minister of foreign affairs, only seven out of 39 government ministers were women prior to the 2021 elections. Following the elections, the government cabinet was reduced to 31 ministers and still included seven women.\n\nDiscrimination against Muslims remains a prevalent issue, although it may be subtle and not immediately apparent. While there are no legal barriers to Muslims’ advancement, their access to various public service positions has been hindered by limited access to basic education, particularly in the northeastern regions. The economic success of Muslim traders has contributed to increased discrimination, which also extends to non-local Muslims, such as Chadians, who are often suspected of exploiting the country’s resources. For many decades, first-generation Central Africans with foreign-sounding names would register their children under Christian- or French-sounding names to avoid discrimination at school and work. The example of Michel Djotodia, the former interim president and the first Muslim head of state in the CAR’s history, illustrates this situation.\n\nThe civil war in 2013 had a devastating impact on the CAR’s economy. GDP contracted by an unprecedented 37% in 2013 to $1.6 billion. The country’s recovery has been hampered by recurrent security crises, the COVID-19 pandemic and external price shocks in the food and energy markets in 2022. By 2021, GDP (current $) had increased to $2.52 billion (compared to $1.95 billion in 2017). Real GDP grew by 1% in 2021, although per capita growth remained negative at -1.0% in 2021 and -0.9% in 2020. The growth estimate for 2022 initially projected an accelerated growth rate of 3.5%. However, due to delays in or withholding of donor contributions, the latest calculations revised the estimate downward to -2.0%. The forecast for 2023 shows a real growth rate of 3.7% and has been revised upward to 5.5%, taking into account the disbursement of delayed donor contributions.\n\nThe inflation rate was 4.3% in 2021 and estimated to reach 6.0% in 2022.\n\nThe future trajectory of economic growth heavily depends on political stability, continued reforms, donor support and improved performance in the forestry and agricultural sectors. The CAR’s economy faces risks due to low levels of economic diversification and heavy reliance on foreign aid, which accounts for over 40% of the budget. The country’s geographical location, with only one access road, makes it highly vulnerable to external shocks, as demonstrated by events in 2020 and 2021. These risks outweigh the incentives to attract foreign direct investment, which amounted to 1.2% of GDP in 2021 (compared to 1.15% in 2019 and 0.2% in 2015, before the 2013 crisis). The overall public debt reached 47.6% of GDP in 2021 and is projected to increase to 54.8% in 2022, breaking the downward trend observed from over 50% in 2017 to 43.4% in 2020.\n\nThe decision to resume legal exports of diamonds from “compliant zones” under the Kimberley Process in July 2016 had a positive effect on government revenues in 2018 and 2019. However, exports were interrupted again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The upward trend in diamond, unwrought gold, and other mineral exports continued in 2021 and 2022, and is expected to continue in 2023.\n\nUnemployment statistics have been unreliable in the CAR, showing steady rates between 2012 and 2014 (6.6% in 2021, 6.4% in 2020) despite the significant economic contraction during those years.\n\nThere is a high variety of structural constraints in the CAR that severely restrict governance capacity. Landlocked, with only one terrestrial, one aerial and one aquatic transport corridor, the country is surrounded by unstable neighbors that have also been going through crises and conflicts. These include Chad, Sudan’s Darfur Province, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cameroon has struggled for years now with the expansion of Boko Haram into its northern provinces. Chad, itself once torn by conflict, has intervened in different ways in CAR. Along with Sudan, it is a strongly problematic neighbor with its own interests. Under former President Idriss Déby, Chad was very influential in CAR domestic politics and has fed its neighbor’s instability with small arms, weapons and soldiers. Frictions remain with the new president, Mahamat Déby, who feels his country’s security threatened by the presence and activities of Wagner Group troops in the northwest of the CAR, close to the border. The CAR has also encountered problems with Chad and Sudan related to their livestock-based economies. Neither country has sufficient grazing capacity to feed its cattle and is thus dependent on the grasslands of the CAR to sustain them. This regularly leads to conflicts with local farmers and populations. Structural constraints include extensive surface water networks, which make communication and mobility considerably difficult in many rural areas. There are neither adequate telecommunication nor transport infrastructures in the countryside. Only 1,300 km of roads are paved, although the CAR is roughly the size of France. Twenty thousand kilometers of unpaved roads are subject to annual closure during the rainy season, which usually lasts between four to six months. This challenging geographical context compounds the historical challenges of a traditionally weak state and only limited basic administration. The country remains one of the poorest in the world. On the UNDP’s Human Development Index, it ranks 188th out of 189 countries. An estimated 71% of the population lives below the international poverty line.\n\nThe CAR has been struggling since its independence to use available resources efficiently. This is not only due to the state’s fragmented control of its territory, but also to the ineffectiveness of the public administration and taxation system. Working for public services is lucrative, given that international partners such as France, the European Union, the World Bank and the IMF have repeatedly provided direct financial support of public sector wages in spite of poor management performance. This has led to a number of problems, including appointments that are largely meritless, clientelism, delayed retirements, duplications and overlaps among available jobs. Consequently, the administration is characterized by the inefficient use of human resources. Organizations are repeatedly reshuffled and decentralized across the country. The quality of human resources has steadily decreased as a long-term effect of the violence in the country. The country has the lowest domestic tax revenues in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the FMI, it only reached CFAF 125.9 billion, which corresponds to 8.8% of GDP. As a result, the CAR has been heavily dependent upon external financing for basic state administration. However, inflows of aid are volatile and leave the country vulnerable to the international community’s goodwill. This is particularly evident now, as traditional partners, such as the IMF, have frozen or delayed financial support, demanding more information about expenditures.\n\nPresident Touadéra seems determined to improve the national administration’s efficiency – more than any previous administration. Progress is slow, mainly due to the fact that the government’s top priority remains security. However, during the review period, the government has made efforts, in particular, to digitalize services. The aim is not only to lay the foundations for digital governance, which would, for instance, ease salary payments to public employees in remote areas of the country. It is also to digitalize the tax administration in order to increase transparency and efficiency.\n\nThe CAR is a member of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). However, similar to other African regions, these economic communities remain insignificant when it comes to promoting intra-regional trade. Trade and exchanges among Central African states is significantly low. This is related to a number of factors, including high trading costs, complex border procedures that complicate trade relationships rather than facilitating them, bad infrastructure, and roads that cannot be used all year round, as well as a lack of diversification and low trade complementarity.\n\nIts neighbors have intensively influenced the CAR’s security. On the one hand, neighbors, such as Chad, Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have consistently exported their conflicts and instability into the CAR. Fluid, porous borders, which are insufficiently monitored, have led to the uncontrolled entry of small arms and armed combatants to the CAR. On the other hand, countries from the region have regularly tried to influence and shape the country’s politics. Most prominently, Chad has exerted massive influence on developments in the CAR, for example, by supporting François Bozizé’s coup in 2003. The CEMAC and the ECCAS have both sent regional troops to the CAR in response to increasing instability and the growing unwillingness of the former colonial power, France, to send its own soldiers. Regional powers, first and foremost Chad’s political elite, have used these military operations to pursue their own interests in the CAR. Beginning in 2019, the CAR established a strong relationship with a new ally in the region, Rwanda. Since MINUSCA’s deployment in the CAR in 2014, Rwanda has maintained peacekeepers in the country. It is currently the CAR’s number one military contributor, with a contingent of 1,698 out of some 11,000 troops in total. In addition, Rwanda and the CAR signed several partnership agreements in 2019. In December 2020, Rwanda sent additional troops to CAR to help block the rebels’ march on Bangui.\n\nThe Central African Republic (CAR) currently faces a range of significant challenges. It remains to be seen how President Faustin-Archange Touadéra will address these challenges during his second term. The country is at a critical juncture from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe year 2021 began with a new escalation of violence, as the CPC coalition of armed groups launched a rebellion following the December 2020 elections. While this revolt had the potential to plunge the fragile, vulnerable country into another severe crisis, the government’s counter-attack with foreign support proved successful.\n\nThe CAR’s shift toward new international allies, particularly Russia and China, is significantly altering its international relations. Russia is viewed as a partner interested in mutually beneficial cooperation, while France is seen as a potential disruptive force that has actively influenced the country’s domestic politics. Many Central Africans hailed Russian mercenaries as liberators following their assistance in reclaiming vast swaths of territory from rebels. By favoring Russian assistance over Western support, the CAR aligns with a geopolitical trend already underway in other former French colonies, such as Mali and Burkina Faso. However, countries heavily reliant on foreign aid and support, like the CAR, risk losing credibility in the eyes of traditional Western partners, while being dependent on their new partnerships.\n\nAnother challenge facing Touadéra’s government is the need for a robust national dialogue. Efforts are required from both the government and rebel groups to implement the Luanda Roadmap. A key aspect of this entails engaging armed groups to ensure the effectiveness of the cease-fire and a cessation of violence.\n\nStructural reforms are also crucial to transforming the national economy, reducing its dependence on foreign aid and the export of a limited range of raw materials. This requires sustainable, private-sector-led, and inclusive economic growth. However, the CAR is still weakened by the 2013 crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a substantial decrease in exports and demand for its commodities. Additionally, the current global economic crisis has resulted in a significant increase in fuel prices, affecting the entire population, from consumers to producers. Economic recovery is intrinsically linked to a stable security environment.\n\nAlthough the security situation has improved significantly following the repulsion of the CPC, it remains fragile.\n\nEnhancing cooperation at the regional level could greatly benefit the CAR. Poor infrastructure, complex border regulations and non-tariff barriers have posed challenges to economic relations with neighboring countries. For a landlocked country like the CAR, cross-border trade is essential to accessing regional and global markets.\n\nUltimately, the country’s stability will depend heavily on the government’s ability to restore and strengthen its social contract. Years of prolonged conflicts and crises have resulted in deep-rooted grievances and limited confidence in the government among the population. Addressing these grievances and tackling the root causes of violence and rebellion, such as poverty, economic inequality and inadequate basic services, is a significant challenge."
