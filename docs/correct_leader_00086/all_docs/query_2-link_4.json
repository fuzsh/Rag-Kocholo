There have been twenty-five heads of government of the Central African Republic and the Central African Empire. The office of Prime Minister, the head of government, was created when the Central African Republic became an autonomous territory of France in December 1958. It was originally the highest post of the Central African Republic, though France did maintain a governor in the territory. After the Central African Republic declared its independence and became a republic on 13 August 1960, David Dacko held both the Prime Minister and newly created President of the Central African Republic posts briefly before eliminating the Prime Minister position and placing all executive power in the office of the President.\n\nPresident Jean-Bédel Bokassa restored the office of Prime Minister to assist him in governing the country in 1975, shortly before he declared himself Emperor. He selected as prime minister Elisabeth Domitien, who become Africa's first female head of government. After Domitien was removed from office, Bokassa named Ange-Félix Patassé to become his next prime minister. Patassé continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa declared the establishment of the Central African Empire in December 1976. Henri Maïdou succeeded Patassé and continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa was overthrown from power. During the following two years of Dacko's presidency, three more politicians served as prime minister. The post was abolished when Dacko was overthrown from the presidency by Andre Kolingba on 1 September 1981. The position, as it exists today, was recreated in 1991, when President Kolingba was forced to relinquish some of the executive power. The President has the authority to name the Prime Minister and can remove them from office at any time. The Prime Minister is the head of the government; within days of being appointed, they must select individuals for their Cabinet, who they will work with to coordinate the government.\n\nAccording to a ceasefire agreement signed between the government and the Séléka rebel coalition on 11 January 2013, President François Bozizé was required to appoint a new Prime Minister from the political opposition after the National Assembly of the Central African Republic is dissolved and legislative elections are held. According to the agreement, this will happen on 11 January 2014 at the latest.[1] Nicolas Tiangaye, who was selected as prime minister by the opposition and rebels, was appointed as prime minister on 17 January 2013.[2]\n\nThe current Prime Minister of the Central African Republic is Félix Moloua, since 7 February 2022.[3]\n\nPolitical parties\n\nCivic Forum (FC)\n\nOther factions\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political affiliations Notes Took office Left office Time in office Central African Republic (1958–1969) (Autonomous within the French Community) 1 Barthélemy Boganda\n\n(1910–1959) 8 December 1958[A] 29 March 1959[B] 111 days MESAN Founder of the MESAN party;[4] negotiated for the independence of Oubangui-Chari and named the country the \"Central African Republic\".[5] — Abel Goumba\n\n(1926–2009) 30 March 1959[6] 30 April 1959 31 days MESAN Served as Acting Prime Minister; had an internal struggle for power with Dacko after Boganda's death. 2 David Dacko\n\n(1930–2003) 1 May 1959[6] 13 August 1960 1 year, 104 days MESAN Seized power from Goumba, with the support of high commissioner Roger Barberot, the Bangui chamber of commerce and Boganda's widow, Michelle Jourdain.[7] Central African Republic (1960–1976) (Independent) 1 David Dacko\n\n(1930–2003) 13 August 1960[6] 14 August 1960[C] 1 day MESAN Also served as head of state (President) upon independence.[8] Post abolished (14 August 1960 – 1 January 1975) 2 Elisabeth Domitien\n\n(1925–2005) 2 January 1975[D][9] 7 April 1976[E][10] 1 year, 96 days MESAN First female head of government in Africa.[11] Vacant (8 April 1976 – 4 September 1976) 3 Ange-Félix Patassé\n\n(1937–2011) 5 September 1976[10][12] 3 December 1976[F] 89 days MESAN Later served as President (1993–2003).[13] Central African Empire (1976–1979) 1 Ange-Félix Patassé\n\n(1937–2011) 8 December 1976[14] 14 July 1978 1 year, 218 days MESAN 2 Henri Maïdou\n\n(born 1936) 14 July 1978[10] 21 September 1979[14] 1 year, 69 days MESAN Wrote a letter on 4 September 1979 to the French government officials, asking them to put an end to Bokassa's tyrannical rule.[15] Less than three weeks later, the French successfully executed Operation Barracuda, toppling the Bokassa regime.

Ngoupande also didn't strongly support President Patassé's decision to call in French troops to suppress the soldier uprising.[56]\n\nM President Patassé fired Dologuélé on 1 April 2001 and replaced him with Ziguélé, a senior diplomat who had served as ambassador to Benin for the last two years. Patassé did not provide an explanation for his decision, but political observers state that the nonpartisan Dologuélé had become widely unpopular with the ruling MLPC party.[57]\n\nN Ziguélé left office when François Bozizé seized power on 15 March 2003.\n\nO On 11 December 2003, Goumba was dismissed as prime minister and was appointed as Vice President.[58]\n\nP Gaombalet resigned as prime minister on 11 June 2005 after being elected as Speaker of the National Assembly on 7 June.[59]\n\nQ In mid-January 2008, members of the National Assembly filed a censure motion against the Doté government, in response to countrywide civil service strike initiated by trade unions to protest the government's failure to pay arrears to government employees.[60] On 18 January, Doté announced his resignation as prime minister.[61]\n\nR Tiangaye resigned with President Michel Djotodia in N'Djamena, Chad on 10 January 2014.[62]\n\nPolitics of the Central African Republic\n\nHistory of the Central African Republic\n\nEmperor of Central Africa\n\nList of heads of state of the Central African Republic\n\nVice President of the Central African Republic\n\nList of colonial governors of Ubangi-Shari\n\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n\nAppiah, K.
