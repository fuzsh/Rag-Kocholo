Having once served as an advisor to the prime minister’s office, Madam Kinigi got elected by President Melchior Ndadaye on July 1993 to serve as Burundi’s first female prime minister during his reign. This was however, cut short when President Melchior’s life was taken in a coup. By the virtue of immediate transition, Madam Kinigi became Burundi’s interim president as from October 1993 to February 1994, after which the National Assembly elected a new President, who then appointed a new Prime minister.\n\nTo learn more about Sylvie Kinigi, click here.\n\nElisabeth Domitien: Africa’s and C.A.R’s first female prime minister.\n\nElisabeth Domitien was believed to be the first female Prime-minister in Sub-Saharan Africa. Believably born in 1925 in Central African Republic (C.A.R), Madam Domitien was recorded to be one of the most active political persons of note in her country, in the ’70s.; from serving as Vice president to the only legal political party, then, of C.A.R in 1975, to being elected by President Jean Bédel Bokassa as prime minister during his reign.\n\nHowever, all this was cut short when President Jean Bokassa declared himself C.A.R’s emperor. A move that was hugely opposed by Madam Domitien. This then rendered her a dismissal from President Bokassa as Prime minister and resultantly, led to her being under house arrest for refusing to accept, now, Emperor Jean Bokassa’s decision.\n\nMadam Domitien died in 2005 in her country and she will not only be deeply remembered in C.A.R for establishing and steering the inclusion of women in public leadership but also in Africa in general, for being the first Sub-Saharan Female Prime minister.

She studied law in France, in her adult life and practised as a corporate lawyer before being mayor of Bangui in her country- the C.A.R.\n\nAfter the self-appointed Seleka President, Michel Djotodia stepped down due to pressure from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the C.A.R sunk into deep violence exerted by the two main factional, opposition, groups, i.e. the Seleka and the anti-Balaka. This rose the need to form a transitional government, which was to lead the country to peace and, where possible, development.\n\nOn January 2014, Madam Samba Panza was then elected, despite the political sidelines and unaccountability in her country, as the head of state of the transition. Her reign was characterized by heavy support from the international community and immense faith in her leadership by the latter.\n\nMadam Samba Panza’s reign came to a halt in 2016, after which, a new, democratically elected government took charge.\n\nTo learn more of Catherine Samba Panza’s accession to power, click here.\n\nSahle Work Zewde: Ethiopia’s first female and current President.\n\nA seasoned diplomat and veteran at the United Nations, Sahle Work Zewde is the only remaining female president in Africa, for now. Born in 1950 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to a family of four girls, President Sahle has risen to the ranks of the most fashioned African diplomats across the continent, through grit, grace and hard-work.\n\nShe was appointed and unanimously voted in as Ethiopia’s president, in October 2018, by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Ethiopia’s parliament respectively, after President Mulatu Teshome resigned from office.\n\nHighly esteemed for her feats, one of which includes being the 2nd woman in Ethiopia to hold an ambassadorial position, President Sahle Work Zewde’s appointment is believed to be a shaping voice and act for women inclusion in Ethiopia.\n\nTo read more about President Sahle Work Zewde, click here.\n\nWill your country be the next?\n\nKindly schedule to read the subsequent series of this article, as from next week."
