        "text": "Humanitarian context\n\nThe Central African Republic (CAR) has been weakened for almost thirty years by repeated military and political crises. The tense security environment, environmental factors and the impact of the crisis in Ukraine, particularly on the prices of fuel and essential goods, most of which are imported, are all factors in explaining the increase in humanitarian needs in the CAR in 2022.\n\nAccording to the 2022 Humanitarian Needs Outlook published by the United Nations Humanitarian Office (OCHA), 3.1 million people in the CAR now need humanitarian aid, compared to 2.8 million in 2021. This represents 63% of the country’s population. Of these 3.1 million people, 2.2 million are in urgent need. 2.4 million are facing acute food insecurity, up from 2.3 million the previous year.\n\nAnother area of particular concern: health, with an estimated 2.7 million people in need.\n\nDescription of the mission\n\nPremière Urgence Internationale is present since 2007 in the CAR, with the objective of responding to the needs of vulnerable populations who have been victims of crises in the country for several decades. The organization’s activities have therefore continued in the country despite the steady deterioration in the security environment that the CAR has experienced in recent years, and even in recent years.\n\nPremière Urgence Internationale works in multiple sectors, the main ones being health and nutrition, logistics, food security, and water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH).\n\nPremière Urgence Internationale is currently present in the capital Bangui via its Coordination Office, as well as in the prefectures of Bamingui-Bangoran, with an operational base in Ndélé and Lim-Pendé, with a second base in Paoua."
