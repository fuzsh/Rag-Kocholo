It is a country-based pooled fund (CBPF), which is a multi-donor humanitarian financing instrument managed by OCHA CAR under the responsibility and leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator (HC).\n\nThe CAR HF has played a significant role in making more resources available for humanitarian activities prioritized under the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). For the past three years, the fund has been counted among the HRP’s top five funding sources.\n\nThe CAR HF aims to:\n\nSupport humanitarian reform to ensure predictable, flexible and timely humanitarian funding to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.\n\nStrengthen the leadership of the HC and the humanitarian coordination system\n\nGovernanceGovernance\n\nGovernance, Policy and Guidance\n\nIn terms of governance, the HC is the custodian of the CAR HF on behalf of the Emergency Relief Coordinator. The HC decides the strategy for the use of the fund, and ensures that the CAR HF is delivering on its key objectives and that funds are managed in accordance with the fund’s Operational Manual and Annexes.\n\nThe HC is supported by an Advisory Board (AB), which has a consultative role and responsibilities in strategic decision-making, risk management, review of operational activities and transparency of overall allocation process. The AB comprises donors, UN agencies, national and international NGOs and OCHA in an equal representation. The daily management of the fund’s programmatic and financial aspects is ensured by the Joint Humanitarian Financing Unit under the supervision of the OCHA Head of Office.\n\nAllocation process\n\nUnder the CAR HF, funding can be allocated via two modalities:\n\nStandard allocation. The standard allocation represents nearly 80 per cent of the funding. This mechanism allows the HC to allocate funds in support of the priority needs of the HRP through the consultative process involving humanitarian partners. As a common practice, the fund launches standard allocations twice a year, as per the HRP cycle and funding availability.\n\nReserve allocation. The reserve allocation represents nearly 20 per cent of the funding. It is used for rapid and flexible allocations of funds in the event of sudden-onset emergencies. In this case, the process goes through a call for proposals on a rolling basis.\n\nThrough a two-step approach of the strategic review and the technical review, the CAR HF offers the opportunity to address humanitarian needs in a collaborative manner, fostering cooperation and coordination within and between the inter-cluster coordinators and humanitarian organizations present in CAR. Additionally, interventions supported by the CAR HF aim to be consistent with the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence."
