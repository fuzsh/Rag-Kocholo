Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee in his place, saying on social media, 'Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year'. #US #Africa #Diaspora #Partnership\n\nIn case you missed it: Canary Wharf development unveils the world‚Äôs largest conversion of an office skyscraper in London: The first images of what the revamped #HSBC tower in #CanaryWharf will look like have been released. Building Design revealed last month KPF had won the architectural competition to reimagine the 45-storey building at 8 Canada Square which the banking giant is planning to move out of by 2027. The firm pipped remaining rivals Foster & Partners and 3XN, the Danish architect behind 2 Finsbury Avenue, to the work with the final three having been whittled down from a longlist of more than 15 practices. The #Qatar Investment Authority, which along with Multiplex owner Brookfield, co-owns Canary Wharf Group, said work will formally begin once HSBC‚Äôs lease expires in three years‚Äô time. Continue reading.. https://lnkd.in/e5CdTrwE Here‚Äôs what to know: HSBC Tower is a 200 metre and 1.1 million sq ft #skyscraper in Canary Wharf, #London, #England. When HSBC vacates the tower in 2027, it is set to be redeveloped, including the removal of large chunks from its facade. Plans for the reimagining of the tower have been unveiled by its owners the #QatariInvestmentAuthority and its development partner Canary Wharf Group. The cuts to the tower will carve out new terraces and divide the building into 8 sections that will be easier to lease. The floors next to the large cut out could become a #hotel and serviced #apartments. The higher floors would become an entertainment complex with #museum, #restaurant and #garden. The lower floors would be new frontage for shops and restaurants. Architect Kohn Pedersen Fox drew up the plan to reimagine the 45-floor building. The cost of the ambitious project has not been revealed but could be somewhere between ¬£400m and ¬£800m once designs are finalised.\n\nIt‚Äôs OFFICIAL: AFRICA WILL launch its OWN credit ratings agency in 2025. Here‚Äôs what to know: A credit ratings company being established to meet the unique needs of Africa‚Äôs #sovereign borrowers is set to be ready by next year, an #AfricanUnion official said Saturday. The institution won‚Äôt be owned by the regional bloc, Albert Muchanga, its commissioner for development, trade, tourism, industry and minerals, told reporters in Ghana‚Äôs capital, #Accra. It‚Äôd be independent and professional, he said. ‚ÄúWe feel that we‚Äôve not been treated very well when it comes to ratings and the cost of borrowing,‚Äù Muchanga said. ‚ÄúWe want an institution developed by #Africans to contribute to the process of de-risking the African capital market so that in the end we are able to have a situation where we can borrow competitively at home and abroad.‚Äù African finance ministers first considered setting up such a body in 2021 amid complaints of unfair treatment by international #creditratings firms that they said lead to higher interest rates relative to what other emerging-market borrowers and developed countries pay. The task is being undertaken by the African Peer Review Mechanism, #AfricanDevelopmentBank, #AfricanExportImportBank and the #AUCommission, Muchanga said. The project is at its next phase of operationalization that entails ‚Äúcoming up with the final work plan to ensure that we are able to roll it out,‚Äù he said. https://lnkd.in/eVsvmEwK #AfricaYesWeCAN #TransformingAfrica #TheAfricaWeWant #AfCFTA #BrandAfrica #AU #GDP #Investment #Africa #AfricaMeansBusiness #ThisIsAfrica #Diaspora #IT #OneAfrica #AUC #TransAfricanHighway #SMEs #CreatingOneAfricanMarket #Invest #Tariffs #TheAfCFTAEffect #Trade #AI #AfricaRising #FDI #IntraAfricanTrade #Agenda2063 #Partnerships #AfCFTATV #WB #BuildBackBetter #InvestInAfrica #AfricanUnity #IMF #WTO #AfDB #TradeNotAid #AfCFTATrading #TravelToAfrica #CFTA #SAATM #TradeInAfrica #TradeUnderAfCFTA #JoinAfCFTA #AfricaOnTheMove #Infrastructure #Tourism #VisitAfrica #MadeInAfrica #AfCFTASecretariat #PanAfricanism #Investors #PAPSS #ZLECAF #AfricanSolutionsToAfricanProblems #Growth #BetterAfricaBetterWorld #StrongerTogether #Afreximbank #UnitedUnderAfCFTA #AfCFTA2024 #Africa2024 #AfricaToTheWorld #GlobalAFRICA\n\nDid you know that the DRC produces 74% of global cobalt? The #DemocraticRepublicofCongo (DRC) accounts for 74% of the WORLD‚Äôs #cobalt output. Although the metal is found on a large scale in other parts of the #world, like #Australia, #Europe, and #Asia, the African nation holds the BIGGEST reserves by FAR. Of the 11,000,000 metric tons of worldwide reserves, it is estimated that 6,000,000 metric tons are located in the #DRC. Since around 20% of the cobalt mined in the DRC originates from small-scale artisanal mines, often employing child labor, the extraction of the metal has been a point of intense debate. With a long history of #conflict, political upheaval, and instability, the country is often listed among the poorest nations in the world. Today, the EV sector constitutes 40% of the overall cobalt market. #China is the world‚Äôs leading #consumer of cobalt, with nearly 87% of its consumption used by the #lithium-ion #battery industry. https://lnkd.in/eR8RJp7F In the U.S., 50% of cobalt consumed is used in #superalloys, mainly in #aircraft gas turbine engines. The facts remain: why is AFRICA, with so many mineral resources, still so poor?

In the quest for economic transformation, and in line with the #AfricanUnion (AU) Agenda 2063, the AU has spearheaded initiatives to promote industrialisation and boost intra-African trade. AIDA, initiated in 2008, and the #AfCFTA, launched in 2018, stand as cornerstones of this vision. Member States‚Äô adoption of AIDA‚Äôs principles and ratification of the AfCFTA mark a steadfast commitment to this transformative path. The AfCFTA is poised to deliver significant economic advantages, with forecasts suggesting the African economy will be nearly USD690 billion ‚Äì or 10% larger ‚Äì in 2043 than it would be on a path without the AfCFTA (at nearly USD 6.7 trillion)1. Yet, the fruition of these benefits is contingent upon member states‚Äô preparedness to enact the AfCFTA measures and align with the principles of AIDA while effectively mitigating potential risks. To aid this endeavour, the following ‚ÄúGuide for Country Impact Assessments on AIDA and the AfCFTA‚Äù has been developed, containing three comprehensive tools crafted to support policymakers..

The French-built railway that ran through it stretched from the Senegalese port of #Dakar to #Mali, deep in the #Sahel, ferrying #peanuts, #gold and other raw materials to the coast for #export. But in recent decades the line has atrophied. A succession of foreign firms took over its management after it was privatised in 2003. Each failed to maintain or expand it. In 2018 the leg from Senegal to Mali halted operations entirely. Its rusting remains in Thi√®s lie under rubbish and weeds. The story of west Africa‚Äôs most famous railway is a cautionary one for governments across the #continent. Africa‚Äôs entire rail network is today only slightly larger than France‚Äôs and Germany‚Äôs combined. In west Africa only one cross-border line is still working. By one estimate, investments of up to $105bn a year until 2050 are needed if Africa‚Äôs network density is to match China‚Äôs or India‚Äôs. Yet between 2012 and 2022 total private investment in rail infrastructure was no more than $6bn, according to the World Bank. That was roughly the same as in the previous decade, despite a surge in infrastructure investment from #China. Where Western firms have occasionally shown interest, grand promises have usually remained on paper.

DRC conflict risks spreading: African leaders must push for solutions beyond military intervention: In response to the deepening crisis in eastern #DemocraticRepublicofCongo (DRC), the #UnitedNationsSecurityCouncil established a panel of independent experts in 2023 to examine the situation and provide it with options to address the #conflict. In June 2024, the #UN released the panel‚Äôs final report. The report provides a devastating account of the unimaginable scale of #violence against #civilians. It also shows the failure of state actors to work in unison to bring #peace to the region. The implicated parties ‚Äì particularly the governments of #Rwanda üá∑üáº, #Uganda üá∫üá¨ and the #DRCongo üá®üá© ‚Äì have protested their innocence. Anthoni van Nieuwkerk, Professor of International and Diplomacy Studies at the University of #SouthAfrica, has researched violent #extremism in Africa, especially its effects in southern and central Africa. ‚ÄúThe unwillingness of ruling elites throughout #centralAfrica to accept responsibility for the #war raises the question of what needs to be done to promote #peace and #development.‚Äù A #military option is clearly not adequate to address the deep-seated historical, ethnic and resource-based fault lines throughout central Africa, as they play out in the #DRC. Relations between the presidents in the region, in particular the DRC and Rwanda, have been strained because of this history. To augment stabilisation measures, #Africanleaders must pursue #diplomatic options. This includes an urgent ceasefire. It must be accompanied by disengagement of forces and neutralising the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which operates from the DRC. There must also be confidence-building measures between the parties to the conflict.

Here‚Äôs what to know: A raft of global institutions - including major banks, #media outlets and airlines - have reported a mass IT outage, affecting their ability to offer services. Several airlines have grounded flights around the world and many more are reporting delays. Capitec Bank, South Africa‚Äôs biggest bank by customers, said it‚Äôs facing nationwide system issues after a series of global technical glitches disrupted services. It‚Äôs ‚Äúan international issue which is affecting multiple #banks and retailers,‚Äù the Stellenbosch, South Africa-based lender said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday. ‚ÄúWe are working hard to resolve this. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.‚Äù The outage hasn‚Äôt affected the bank‚Äôs card-payment systems, it said on X. The #JohannesburgStockExchange issued a notice stating that the #FTSE indices are not updating. ‚ÄúClients are advised that we are aware of the FTSE issue globally and are awaiting resolution.
