        "text": "After years in exile and jail, some time in government and decades in opposition, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf entered the annals of history today when she became Africa's first elected female president.\n\nShe took the oath of office at a ceremony attended by thousands of her compatriots, African leaders and top-ranking representatives from further afield including the United States.\n\nShe won the second round of internationally endorsed presidential elections in November against her rival and world football star George Weah, who initially alleged fraud but later dropped the charges.\n\nAt age 67, Sirleaf is bouyed by a resume impressive for its scope and accomplishments at a time when African women were considered best suited to tend to their homes, not their governments or their countries.\n\nAnd she has earned the moniker \"Iron Lady\" for a steely-eyed determination that led her to reject a Senate seat after fraudulent elections in 1985, a move that got her thrown into jail by military dictator Samuel Doe.\n\nA former finance minister under presidents William Tolbert and William Tubman, Sirleaf spent decades shuttling in and out of exile, laying the groundwork for an eventual return to Africa's oldest independent republic.\n\nWith a degree from Harvard University, the eight-time grandmother and divorced mother of four has worked at Citibank, the UN Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the Soros Foundation and the influential International Crisis Group think-tank.\n\n\"I have always tried to be me, to live a life filled with activism and fighting for what I believe is right,\" she told AFP in an interview last year.\n\n\"I have the breadth and depth of experience in politics and a solid record outside of Liberia. I know that I can be a force for good in this country and am counting on having the chance to try.\"\n\nThe peacebuilding challenges that confront her are colossal in a country with poor infrastructure and lacking running water or electricity, with few telephone lines or usable roads and the barest of health and educational systems.\n\nShe must try to reconcile the deep divisions that have sent Liberia tumbling into war year after year, sending shockwaves of conflict reverberating around troubled west Africa.\n\n\"Our biggest challenges are peace and stability and in that we must respect the needs of the thousands and thousands of youths,\" she told AFP.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 former fighters have to be integrated into the system. Many of the former combatants are young and consider her too old to understand their needs. Illiteracy rates are high and 80 per cent of the workforce are jobless.\n\nAfrica's women leaders\n\nLiberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has been sworn in as Africa's first elected female president in the presence of US First Lady Laura Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nHere are details on some previous female political leaders in Africa.\n\nCarmen Pereira (1937- )\n\nActing president of Guinea Bissau for three days in May, 1984, in the capacity of chairwoman of the National People's Assembly. She continued as head of the assembly until 1992.\n\nSylvie Kinigi (1952- )\n\nKinigi was appointed prime minister of Burundi in July 1993.\n\nMonths later she became the rallying point for surviving ministers of the ousted government after the democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, an ethnic Hutu, and six cabinet ministers were assassinated in a coup attempt on October 21, 1993, sparking civil war.\n\nAgathe Uwilingiyimana (1953-1994)\n\nRwandan prime minister at the time of the genocide -- she was slain by hardline Hutu soldiers in April 1994 as hapless UN forces watched. She had fought and lost a battle for ethnic reconciliation and an end to oppression of women in the central African state. Uwilingiyimana became prime minister in July 1993, the second African woman to hold a prime minister's job, appointed just a week after Sylvie Kinigi.\n\nRuth Perry (1939- )\n\nPerry was appointed leader of Liberia's transitional State Council in September 1996 and was given the task of guiding the country's armed factions to disarmament and elections scheduled in 1997.\n\nShe was modern Africa's first woman head of state. Charles Taylor took over as president of Liberia in August 1997.\n\nElisabeth Domitien (1926-2005)\n\nIn January 1975, Central African Republic dictator Jean-Bedel Bokassa formed a new government and introduced the post of prime minister, appointing Domitien. She became the first woman to serve as prime minister of an African nation.\n\nHer relationship with Bokassa soured after he began discussing the possibility of instituting a monarchy with himself as emperor. When Domitien openly rejected the plans, she was fired and her cabinet was dismissed in April 1976.\n\nAgencies"
