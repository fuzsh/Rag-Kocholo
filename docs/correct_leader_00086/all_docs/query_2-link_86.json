        "text": "HI first worked in the Central African Republic from 1994 to 2004 running development programmes that included opening the Bangui orthopaedic centre and setting up the country's only university training course for physical therapy assistants. HI returned to CAR in 2016 to launch logistics platform projects that support and facilitate the delivery of aid by humanitarian organisations throughout the country. Today, the programme manages a logistics platform composed of a road and river component and an aerial component.\n\nIn September 2018, in partnership with MSF Holland, HI CAR introduced rehabilitation activities at Bambari General Hospital. This project provides physical rehabilitation care, technical devices and psychosocial support to people with specific needs. In 2022, HI opened an integrated rehabilitation service in Bangassou hospital, similar to the one in Bambari. Teams have also been delivering stimulation therapy activities to children who have experienced an episode of acute to severe malnutrition. The aim of stimulation therapy is to prevent and reduce developmental delays and disabilities linked to malnutrition and to encourage parents to stimulate their child.\n\nIn 2022, HI launched its first explosive ordnance risk education project in the north- east of the country. This project is being conducted in conjunction with a mental health and psychosocial support project aimed at populations exposed to the risks of explosive devices or in situations of psychological distress.\n\nFinally, HI has just started a pilot project on inclusive education in three prefectures: Ouaka, Ouham and Ouham-Pende. The aim is to promote access to quality education for girls and boys with disabilities"
