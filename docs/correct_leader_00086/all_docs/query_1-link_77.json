        "text": "Defixiones, also known as curse tablets, are one of the most revealing sources for ancient magico-religious practices. Born of rancour, anger, desire, love, envy, or just out of desperation, curse tablets were a strategy for obtaining ‘individual justice’ for those who could not accomplish their purposes through the available means, due to a lack of knowledge, power or legal/economical resources. In this volume, the reader will find a detailed catalogue that discusses 535 curse tablets written in Latin and a wide range of local languages. The catalogue is preceded by a full introduction in which the main features of these inscriptions are discussed together with leading scholarship. Such a detailed yet global study of these texts sheds light on various aspects of curses that vary on a regional basis, thus showing how this magico-religious technology was not only adopted but also adapted in new and creative ways by the local populations throughout the Roman West.\n\nAn opisthographic lead tablet from Nomentum, dating to the first half of the 1st century CE, contains two anatomical curses against a man (side A) and a female public slave (side B). Whilst the curse against the man aimed to affect not only some parts of his body, but also his social and economic status, the one against the woman describes in detail only pieces of her body, with particular emphasis to her abdomen and genitals. The first section of the paper aims to provide the status quaestionis of the study of this curse tablet, with particular regard to the epigraphic and linguistic aspects of the text. The second section sets out to offer a general overview of the role of female public slaves in the Roman world, which may allow a better contextualization of the meaning of the curse on side B.\n\nAn opisthographic lead tablet from Nomentum, dating to the first half of the 1 century CE, contains two anatomical curses against a man (side A) and a female public slave (side B).

This paper aims to tease out the implications of a singular, durable residue of ancient magic and superstition (CIL 6.20905). Does the inscribed text confirm or contest the conventional schema for organizing curse formulae? Can it be used as evidence for certain conventional or non-normative types of belief-system, civic credulity, and ritual practice? What cultural ‘realities’ are revealed by the stories it tells, the social relations it describes, and the terrible fate it invokes? A complementary aim is to attempt a gendered analysis of this non-canonical epigraphic trace.\n\nIf magic is to cease to be regarded as an insignificant aspect of ancient religious practice, both its reliance upon major cognitive patterns and its importance for social history need to be more widely recognized. One means of achieving this end is pragmatically to abandon the abstract categories 'religion' and 'magic', with their inescapable moral packaging, and think instead in terms of optional, semi-institutionalized strategies open to individuals in predicaments that for them were crisis-situations that threatened their social, economic, moral or emotional existence. Written curse-tablets (defixiones) are our most direct evidence of such strategies, but the limited information they provide needs to be supplemented by more general considerations. This paper focuses upon the psychological aspects of some of these texts in the NorthWestern provinces, especially their concern to use guilt feelings and remorse as a tool for restoring an ideal concept of justice."
