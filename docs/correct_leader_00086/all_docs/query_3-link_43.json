Following these incidents, the Mayi-Mayi restarted and intensified their attacks on\n\nUPDF convoys between Beni and Butembo. In retaliation, the UPDF forces led operations against\n\nvillages suspected of sheltering Mayi-Mayi groups. UPDF soldiers often made disproportionate use\n\nof force during these attacks, killing combatants and civilians indiscriminately.\n\n On 1 November 2000, UPDF soldiers allegedly killed between seven and eleven people during\n\nan attack on the population of the villages of Maboya and Loya, 16 kilometres north of the\n\ntown of Butembo. A few hours before the attack, four UPDF soldiers had been killed by\n\nVurondo Mayi-Mayi during an ambush close to the village of Maboya. During the afternoon,\n\nUPDF soldiers apparently launched an indiscriminate attack on the inhabitants of both villages\n\nand set 43 houses on fire. Some victims were shot and killed, whilst others were burned\n\nalive532.\n\nPage 173\n\n348. On 8 November 2000, close to the village of Butuhe, 10 kilometres north of Butembo,\n\nVurondo Mayi-Mayi attacked a UPDF convoy that was escorting lorries transporting minerals.\n\n On 9 November 2000, UPDF soldiers are alleged to have killed indiscriminately 36 people in\n\nthe village of Kikere, close to Butuhe, north of Butembo. The soldiers fired blindly on\n\ncivilians using rifles and rocket-launchers. Some civilians died as a result of being burned alive\n\nin their homes. The soldiers also systematically killed domestic animals and destroyed civilian\n\nproperty533.\n\n349. In the town of Beni, UPDF soldiers instituted a reign of terror for several years with\n\ncomplete impunity. They carried out summary executions of civilians, arbitrarily detained large\n\nnumbers of people and subjected them to torture and various other cruel, inhuman or degrading\n\ntreatments. They also introduced a particularly cruel form of detention, putting the detainees in\n\nholes dug two or three metres deep into the ground, where they were forced to live exposed to bad\n\nweather, with no sanitation and on muddy ground.\n\n In March 2000, UPDF soldiers allegedly killed four civilians and wounded several others in the\n\ntown of Beni during an operation to quell a demonstration. The victims had been protesting\n\nagainst the murder of a woman, the arbitrary arrest of her husband and the pillaging of their\n\nhouse, committed a few days earlier by UPDF soldiers534.\n\n350. During the period under consideration, UPDF soldiers carried out several operations\n\nagainst an armed group of Ugandan origin, the ADF-NALU (Allied Democratic Forces–National\n\nArmy for the Liberation of Uganda535) based in the Ruwenzori massif in the Beni region. For their\n\npart, ADF-NALU carried out attacks on villages in the Ruwenzori region, kidnapping numerous\n\ncivilians and pillaging their property. In this context, the Mapping Team documented the following\n\nalleged incidents.\n\n- 20 -\n\nPages 189-190\n\n361. In August 1999, whilst international pressure on the leaders of the RCD-Goma to sign\n\nthe Lusaka Agreement596 was intensifying, the simmering crisis between Rwanda and Uganda for\n\nthe control of the RCD degenerated into open conflict in Kisangani. On the morning of 7 August,\n\nAPR and UDPF soldiers fought with heavy weapons for several hours without any civilians being\n\nwounded. The situation calmed down again over the course of the following days. Tension\n\ncontinued to build, nonetheless, and both sides strengthened their positions and brought large\n\nnumbers of weapons into the town. On the evening of 14 August, fighting again broke out between\n\nthe two armies at the airport and extended along the main roads and into the town centre.\n\n From 14 to 17 August 1999, APR and UPDF soldiers are said to have used heavy weapons in\n\nareas with a dense civilian population as they fought to gain control of the town of Kisangani.\n\nThe fighting allegedly caused the deaths of over 30 civilians and wounded over 100 of them.\n\nThe APR fired on both military targets and private homes belonging to civilians suspected of\n\nsupporting the Ugandans. Once the hostilities were over, Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers\n\npillaged several places in Kisangani.597\n\n362. After three days of fighting, Uganda and Rwanda signed a ceasefire agreement that\n\nprovided for Kisangani to be demilitarised and the headquarters of the pro-Ugandan branch of the\n\nRCD, the RCD-Kisangani-Mouvement de Libération (RCD-K-ML) led by Wamba dia Wamba, to\n\nbe relocated to Bunia on 1 October 1999. During the months that followed, Orientale Province\n\nfound itself divided into a “Rwandan zone” under the control of the RCD-G and a “Ugandan zone”\n\ndominated by the various movements supported by Kampala. In May 2000, however, tension\n\nbetween the Ugandan and Rwandan armies again moved up a notch in Kisangani. The UPDF\n\nstrengthened its military positions to the north-east of the town and the APR reacted by bringing in\n\nadditional weapons.\n\n On 5 May 2000, the APR and UPDF are said to have used heavy weapons in densely populated\n\nareas, causing the deaths of over 24 civilians and wounding an unknown number of them.\n\nBefore the start of the hostilities, the Ugandan army had warned the population of the imminent\n\nbombardments and had asked for the evacuation of several areas located close to their\n\ntargets598.\n\nPage 190\n\n363. On 12 May 2000, a team of United Nations military observers was sent to the area.\n\nUnder international mediation, the two parties adopted a demilitarisation plan for the town, which\n\nthey began to implement on 29 May. Fighting broke out again on 5 June, however, resulting in the\n\nso-called “Six-Day War”.\n\n The APR and UPDF fought each other in Kisangani from 5 to 10 June 2000. Both sides\n\nreportedly embarked on indiscriminate attacks with heavy weapons, killing between 244 and\n\n760 civilians according to some sources, wounding over 1,000 and causing thousands of people\n\nto be displaced. The two armies also destroyed over 400 private homes and caused serious\n\ndamage to public and commercial properties, places of worship, including the Catholic\n\nCathedral of Notre-Dame, educational institutions and healthcare facilities, including hospitals.\n\nThe UPDF had taken steps to avoid civilian losses by ordering the evacuation of combat zones\n\nbefore the start of hostilities and prohibiting access to three areas that were declared off-limits\n\nto non-combatants. This restriction was, however, also extended to humanitarian workers, in\n\nparticular the ICRC, which was not able to get help to the wounded for several days599.\n\n- 21 -\n\n7. Ituri\n\n364. In mid-August 1998, UPDF soldiers arrived in Ituri and quickly took control of the\n\ndistrict without encountering any real resistance. Like the rest of Orientale Province, Ituri was\n\nplaced under RCD administration. Following the movement’s split, in March 1999, into a\n\npro-Rwandan branch (RCD-Goma) and a pro-Ugandan branch (RCD-ML), Ituri was integrated into\n\nthe RCD-ML zone and administered from Kisangani. The key man on the ground in Ituri, however,\n\nwas the UPDF Chief of Staff, General Kazini. He applied a policy that supported autonomy for the\n\nregion in relation to the rest of Orientale Province and openly favoured the interests of the Hema\n\ncommunity, thus reviving former conflicts over land.\n\nPage 191\n\n365. The Hema-Gegere farmers600 who, a few years previously, had acquired new\n\nconcessions from the land registry in the Djugu region, took advantage of the new political\n\nsituation to enforce their rights. As the Lendu from the Walendu Pitsi601 community, who held the\n\ncustomary rights to the land concerned, disputed the value of their title deeds, the Hema-Gegere\n\nfarmers appealed to the courts and had the Walendu Pitsi expelled from the concessions they\n\nwanted. The latter refused to leave, however, and clashes broke out with the police officers who\n\nhad come to remove them. Several senior Lendu, including the leaders of the Walendu Pitsi and\n\nWalendu Djatsi communities, were arrested for vandalism. In April 1999, the Hema-Gegere\n\nconcession-holders paid UPDF and APC soldiers to attack the Lendu villages located in the\n\ndisputed concessions602.\n\n366. . . .\n\n Between June and December 1999, UPDF and APC soldiers killed an unknown number of\n\nLendu civilians in villages in the Djugu region close to the concessions claimed by the\n\nHema-Gegere farmers. Villages in the Dz’na Buba, Linga, Jiba, Dhendo, Blukwa Mbi, Laudjo,\n\nLaudedjo Gokpa, Nyalibati and Gbakulu groupements were particularly badly affected. Most\n\nof the victims were Lendu but Hema were also killed during the attacks. Numerous victims\n\ndied when their village was set on fire or following heavy arms fire directed at their homes.\n\nSome victims were shot dead at point-blank range605.\n\nPage 192\n\n Between June and December 1999, members of the Lendu militia killed several tens of\n\nHema-Gegere in the village of Libi from the Walendu Pitsi community and in the village of\n\nFataki from the Walendu Djatsi community. These attacks led to the displacement of almost\n\nall the Hema-Gegere living in the Walendu Pitsi community606.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n On 20 June 1999, members of the Hema militias and UPDF soldiers killed at least 25 people,\n\nincluding several civilians, during an attack on the village of Dhendro, in the Walendu Pitsi\n\ncommunity, on the border with the Dhendro groupement608.\n\n On 14 September 1999, members of the Lendu militias from the Walendu Pitsi community\n\nused edged weapons to kill several hundred Hema-Gegere, including a majority of civilians,\n\nduring widespread attacks on locations in the Dhendro groupement in the Bahema-Nord\n\ncommunity. Members of the militias also pillaged and set fire to tens of villages. The victims\n\nwere buried in mass graves. According to several sources, the massacre took place in\n\nretaliation for an attack committed on 20 June by members of the Hema militias in the village\n\nof Dhendro609.\n\n- 22 -\n\n On 14 September 1999, during a night-time offensive on the village of Fataki, in the Walendu\n\nDjatsi community, members of the Hema militias and Hema soldiers from the APC killed\n\nseveral tens of civilians with edged weapons, including at least 15 minors and several women.\n\nThe assailants then buried the bodies themselves. Following the attack, all the Lendu left the\n\nvillage and Fataki became a Hema bastion in the Walendu Djatsi community.610\n\n367. During the months that followed, members of the Lendu militias tried to regain control\n\nof Fataki on several occasions. For its part, the UPDF concentrated its troops on Fataki and Linga\n\nand led several offensives against Lendu militia bases in Kpandroma and Rethy, in the Walendu\n\nDjatsi community.\n\nPage 193\n\n368. During the period under consideration, the Lendu militias also attacked villages in the\n\nDjugu region on the shores of Lake Albert, the majority of which were populated by Hema611.\n\n In July 1999, members of the Lendu militias from the Buba group in the Walendu Pitsi\n\ncommunity allegedly killed over 100 Hema civilians in the fishing village of Musekere in the\n\nBahema-Nord community. Having encircled the village at dawn and forced six APC soldiers\n\nthere to flee, they massacred the population using machetes and other edged weapons. From\n\nthe start of the conflict, the Lendu leaders of the Buba groupement had threatened to attack the\n\ninhabitants of Musekere on several occasions612.\n\n369. . . .\n\n On 1 December 1999, members of the Lendu militias confronted elements of the UPDF and\n\nmembers of the Hema militias over control of the mining town of Bambou, in the Walendu\n\nDjatsi community in the Djugu region. The fighting allegedly led to the deaths of over\n\n200 members of the civilian population. Numerous victims were mutilated and the town\n\nlooted. Most of the victims’ bodies were thrown into the River Chari614.\n\n370. . . .\n\nPage 194\n\n In January 2000, members of the Lendu militias from the Walendu Pitsi and Bahema-Nord\n\ncommunities attacked people living in the Blukwa groupement, killing several hundreds of\n\nHema with edged weapons. The groupement had been the site of violent inter-ethnic\n\nconfrontations since September 1999. The attack in January took place after the departure of\n\nAPC troops, fleeing from the increasing violence617.\n\n On 26 April 2000, members of the Hema militias and UPDF troops attacked the Buba\n\ngroupement, in the Walendu Pitsi community, causing around 10 deaths, the majority of whom\n\nwere Lendu civilians618.\n\n Between 27 August and 12 September 2000, members of the Hema militias from Mangala,\n\nGhele, Gele and Liko, sometimes acting with the support of the Hema APC soldiers, pillaged\n\nand set fire to several villages in the Walendu Djatsi community including Mbau (27 August),\n\nGlakpa and Gobi (28 August), Logai (29 August), the villages in the Dz’na groupement\n\n(31 August) and Mayalibo (6-12 September)619.\n\n- 23 -\n\nPage 206\n\n10. Équateur\n\n381. In November 1998, a new rebellion, the Mouvement pour la libération du\n\nCongo (MLC) began with support from Uganda. Led by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, in the early\n\ndays the MLC had just one battalion consisting mainly of ex-FAZ soldiers supported by elements\n\nof the UPDF. In a few months, however, the MLC army, the Armée de libération du Congo (ALC)\n\nadded numerous ex-FAZ to its ranks and took control of several urban areas in the north of\n\nÉquateur province. The town of Bumba fell on 17 November, the town of Lisala on 10 December,\n\nthe village of Businga, on the crossroads to the towns of Gemena and Gbadolite on 20 December,\n\nthe town of Gemena on 24 December and the village of Libenge, in the far west of the province, on\n\nthe border with the Central African Republic, on 4 January 1999. The FAC conducted very intense\n\nair bombardments in December 1998 to block the advance of the ALC/UPDF. In this context, the\n\nMapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n On 22 December 1998, an FAC Antonov dropped 11 home-made bombs on the village of\n\nBusinga, killing five civilians. On 24 December, an FAC Antonov plane bombed the village a\n\nsecond time, killing two civilians669.\n\nPage 209\n\n386. Taking advantage of the withdrawal of ANT troops and the arrival of reinforcements\n\nfrom the recruitment and training camps, ALC/UPDF soldiers launched a second major offensive\n\nin May 1999. In three months, ALC/UPDF troops regained control of the towns of Kateke\n\n(27 April 1999), Businga (14 May 1999) and Gbadolite (3 July 1999).\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n387. In June 1999, the ALC/UPDF troops took control of Bongandanga, a town south of\n\nLisala.\n\nPages 216-217\n\n402. During the period under consideration, the Bas-Uélé district remained under the control\n\nof ALC/UPDF soldiers. The latter allegedly committed serious violations against all those who\n\ndared to dispute their authority or criticised their involvement in pillaging the natural resources of\n\nthe region. The case below is mentioned for illustrative purposes.\n\n From 2001 to January 2003, elements of the ALC/UPDF apparently tortured and killed an\n\nunknown number of civilians in the town of Buta. Most of the victims were held in muddy\n\nholes in conditions likely to cause death through disease or exhaustion. After a human rights\n\nactivist had been tortured and held in one of the muddy holes by the soldiers, MONUC and\n\nUnited Nations organisations sent out an investigative mission and had these prisons shut\n\ndown708.\n\nPages 218-219\n\nB. Ituri\n\n404. During the second half of 2000, the underlying conflict between the President of the\n\nRCD-ML, Wamba dia Wamba and his two principal lieutenants, the Nande Mbusa Nyamwisi714\n\nand the Hema John Tibasima715 broke out in public. Wamba dia Wamba had long criticised\n\nNyamwisi and Tibasima for trying to orchestrate the conflict between the Hema and Lendu\n\n- 24 -\n\ncommunities716 in order to establish a power base in the district and control the region’s natural\n\nresources. In August, Wamba dia Wamba tried to regain control of the movement by dismissing\n\nNyamwisi and Tibasima from their posts, but they resisted and the number of incidents on the\n\nground between the different factions of the APC increased. After several unsuccessful attempts at\n\nmediation by Uganda and a series of confrontations in the centre of Bunia, Wamba dia Wamba was\n\nexiled to Kampala in December, leaving the leadership of the RCD-ML to Nyamwisi and\n\nTibasima.\n\n405. In January 2001, Ituri saw a resurgence of violence in the Djugu area. Between January\n\nand February, members of the Hema militias from Bogoro, generally accompanied by Hema\n\nsoldiers from the APC and UPDF soldiers, led indiscriminate attacks in the Walendu Tatsi\n\ncommunity, next to the Bahema-Nord community, killing an unknown number of civilians. In this\n\ncontext, the Mapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n On 4 January 2001, during a failed attack on Kpandroma, members of the Hema militias based\n\nin Fataki killed at least 35 Lendu civilians in the Zabu groupement in the Walendu Pitsi\n\ncommunity, particularly in Aruda and Mola and the surrounding area717.\n\n In early 2001, members of the Hema militias killed at least 16 people and kidnapped two\n\nminors who have been since recorded as having disappeared in the Salimboko,\n\nPoli-Masumbuku and Penyi groupements in the Walendu Tatsi community718.\n\nPage 219-220\n\n Also in early 2001, members of the Lendu militias killed an unknown number of civilians,\n\nincluding a majority of Hema and Alur in the villages alongside Lake Albert in the Bahema\n\nBanywagi and Bahema-Nord communities719.\n\n Between January and February 2001, UPDF soldiers attacked around 20 villages in the\n\nWalendu Tatsi community, killing around 100 people, including various Lendu civilians.\n\nDuring the attacks, the soldiers also committed rape, looted and caused an unknown number of\n\npeople to disappear. Most of the victims were killed in villages located near the Zumbe power\n\nstation, in the Bedu Ezekere groupement, where they had gathered under the protection of\n\nmembers of the Lendu militias720.\n\n On 3 February 2001, members of the Hema militias and UPDF troops killed 105 people,\n\nincluding numerous Lendu civilians, in the villages in the Bulo groupement in the Ndo Okebo\n\ncommunity in the Djugu region. The victims often came from the Walendu Pitsi community.\n\nThey had taken refuge in the Bulo groupement following recent attacks on their village721.\n\n406. At the end of 2000, the conflict between the Hema and Lendu finally reached the Irumu\n\nregion. The UPDF soldiers lent their support to the local Hema communities and violent incidents\n\nbroke out on the ground.\n\n Between 9 and 18 January 2001, members of the Hema militias allegedly killed around\n\n60 people, including numerous Lendu and Ngiti civilians722, in the village of Kotoni, in the\n\nIrumu region and the surrounding area723.\n\n407. Following the bombardment of the Walendu Bindi community by a UPDF helicopter,\n\nNgiti militiamen, originally in conjunction with the Djugu Lendu from the Walendu Bindi\n\ncommunity, launched an attack on 19 January 2001 against UPDF positions at the airport in Bunia.\n\nDuring the attack, Ngiti militiamen tried to destroy the helicopter the UPDF had used to bomb their\n\nvillages. The UPDF finally repelled the attack but at the cost of a significant loss of human life.\n\n- 25 -\n\nPage 220\n\n On 19 January 2001, Hema militiamen and civilians allegedly killed between 200 and\n\n250 civilians from the Lendu, Ngiti, Nande and Bira ethnic groups in the Mudzipela\n\nneighbourhood in the town of Bunia. The victims, who included a large number of women and\n\nchildren, were killed with machetes, spears or studded batons. Most of them were subjected to\n\nmutilation. Some were decapitated and their heads carried through the town as trophies. The\n\nHema militiamen and civilians also systematically looted the victims’ property and set fire to\n\nseveral houses. Shortly before the massacre, UPDF officers and senior members of the Hema\n\ncommunity in Bunia had held a meeting and called on Hema civilians to attack the Lendu\n\npopulation.724\n\n408. In order to restore calm to Ituri and avoid new splinter groups developing within the\n\nRCD-ML, Uganda forced the RCD-ML and MLC to join forces within a new movement, the Front\n\nde libération du Congo (FLC), led by Jean-Pierre Bemba725. On 6 February 2001, the FLC\n\norganised consultations with the traditional chiefs in Ituri and on 17 February, the latter signed a\n\nmemorandum of agreement, providing in particular for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the\n\ndisarmament of the militiamen and the dismantling of the training camps726. During the months\n\nthat followed, the number of violations decreased significantly. Inter-community tension on the\n\nground nonetheless remained high and the militias continued to arm themselves. In this context,\n\nthe Mapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n On 26 April 2001, armed men killed six members of the ICRC during an attack on a\n\nhumanitarian convoy in the area around Fataki in the Walendu Djatsi community, in the Djugu\n\nregion. Local sources indicate that the attack is thought to have been perpetrated by Ugandan\n\nsoldiers and Hema militiamen. The attack was supposedly aimed at ending the presence of\n\nhumanitarian personnel in areas where the displaced Lendu had taken refuge. During the\n\nperiod under consideration, numerous sources indicate that Hema militias and armed groups\n\nseverely hampered the work of humanitarian organisations in areas populated principally by\n\nLendu727.\n\nPages 221-222\n\n In 2001, Hema soldiers from the APC killed 40 Lendu, a majority of them civilians, including\n\nwomen, children and elderly and disabled people, in the village of Gobu in the Bahema-Nord\n\ncommunity. The victims were taken to a ditch and shot. Their bodies were then thrown into\n\nthe ditch728.\n\n In January 2002, UPDF troops and Hema militiamen opened fire on the population of the\n\nvillage of Kobu in the Walendu Djatsi community in the Djugu region, killing 35 Lendu\n\ncivilians. As they entered the village, Ugandan soldiers killed four civilians in the marketplace,\n\nincluding one disabled person. Almost all of the population fled and hid in the forest for nearly\n\ntwo months. On their return to the village, the villagers found 35 decomposed bodies, which\n\nthey buried in various places. Those responsible for the massacre were trying to remove Lendu\n\npopulations from the Kobu area, close to the Kilomoto gold mines. Following the killing, the\n\npopulation of Kobu sent a petition to Governor Lopondo, who visited the area shortly\n\nafterwards accompanied by senior figures in the UPDF. Following the visit, UPDF soldiers\n\nleft the area729.\n\n On 26 January 2002, members of the Hema militias killed around 100 Lendu in a forest a few\n\nkilometres from Datule, in the Bahema-Sud community in the Irumu region. The victims had\n\nbeen chased from the village of Datule the previous day by a UPC commander. They were\n\nkilled with machetes, spears and studded batons. A young girl of 13 was the only person to\n\nsurvive the attack730.\n\n- 26 -\n\n On 28 January 2002, Hema militiamen killed and mutilated around 50 Lendu civilians in\n\nKasenyi in the Irumu region. Having been informed of the massacre that had taken place on\n\n26 January, the victims had fled the village of Datule on 27 January in the hope of reaching the\n\nLendu villages in the Walendu Bindi community. They were hiding behind a police station\n\nwhen they were surprised and killed731.\n\n Between January and May 2002, Hema militiamen in the region forcibly recruited all the men\n\nfrom the Alur ethnic group living in the village of Gobu in the Bahema-Nord community in the\n\nDjugu region732.\n\n Between February and April 2002, elements of the UPDF and Hema militiamen killed several\n\nhundred Lendu civilians in the Walendu Bindi community in the Irumu region. They also\n\ntortured and raped an unknown number of people. The villages of Aveba, Bukiringi, Nombe,\n\nKaswara, Djino, Kagaba, Biro, Kapalayi, Gety étang, Tsubina, Kinyamubaya, Karach, Bolomo,\n\nBachange, Tsede, Molangi, Tamara, Irura, Modiro, Mukiro and Anyange were all pillaged733.\n\nPage 222\n\n409. In February 2002, against a background of growing economic rivalry between Hema\n\nand Nande businessmen and disagreements on the new strategic directions taken by the\n\nMouvement734, the Defence Minister of the RCD-ML, Thomas Lubanga, and the Hema soldiers of\n\nthe APC broke away from the RCD-ML to form a political and military Hema group, the Union des\n\npatriotes congolais (UPC). In response, Mbusa Nyamwisi and Nande officers in the APC,\n\nsupported by certain members of the UPDF, reduced Hema influence in the district735, intensified\n\ntheir cooperation with the FAC736 and encouraged members of the Lendu and Ngiti militias to join\n\nforces in political military groups, namely the Front National Intégrationiste (FNI)737 and the\n\nForces de résistance patriotique en Ituri (FRPI)738. During the course of 2002, these various armed\n\ngroups received significant supplies of weapons from Uganda and the Government in Kinshasa. In\n\nthis context, the Mapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n Starting on 21 May 2002 and during the course of the next six months, elements of the UPC\n\nkilled at least 46 civilians, most of them from the Bira ethnic group, in Walu in the\n\nNgombe-Nyama groupement, in the Irumu region. The militiamen also raped an unknown\n\nnumber of women, looted and destroyed educational institutions and hospitals. These attacks\n\nwere supposedly intended as retaliation for the help given to the Lendu by the Bira during the\n\nprevious attacks against the Hema in the region739.\n\n In May 2002, Lendu militiamen accompanied by civilians killed at least 80 people, mainly\n\nHema and Alur, in the village of Gobu in the Bahema-Nord community. The victims were\n\ncivilians or soldiers who were no longer able to fight. Most were summarily executed with\n\nedged weapons. According to several witness statements, the Hema militiamen in the area had\n\nfled before members of the Lendu militias arrived in the village740.\n\nPages 223-224\n\n In early June 2002, elements of the UPDF and Hema militiamen indiscriminately killed\n\nmembers of the Lendu militias and an unknown number of civilians in the Lendu villages in\n\nthe Walendu Pitsi community. By way of example, in June 2002, Hema militiamen and\n\nelements of the UPDF killed at least 27 people in Buba741.\n\n410. In June 2002, faced with the advance of Lendu militiamen into the Banyali-Kilo\n\ncommunity in the Djugu region, the local Security Council for the town of Mongwalu decided to\n\nchase away or eliminate any Lendu living in the town. In this context, the Mapping Team\n\ndocumented the following alleged incidents.\n\n- 27 -\n\n On 10 June 2002, elements of the UPC supported by local youths, systematically attacked the\n\nhouses of Lendu living in Mongwalu, killing around 20 civilians. The victims, who were\n\nlong-term residents of Mongwalu, were either shot dead or killed with studded batons742.\n\n On 11 June 2002, in retaliation for a massacre carried out the day before, several hundred\n\nLendu from the villages of Kobu, Bambou and Kpandroma killed tens of civilians with edged\n\nweapons, most of them from the Hema ethnic group, in the town of Mongwalu. The Hema left\n\nMongwalu following the massacre743.\n\n411. In early August 2002, elements of the UPC, with support from UPDF troops, are\n\nreported to have chased elements of the APC out of the town of Bunia. In this context, the\n\nMapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n Between 7 and 10 August 2002, in Bunia, at least 300 civilians were killed on the basis of their\n\nethnic origin, most of them by UPC militiamen. Between 7 and 8 August, elements of the UPC\n\nkilled an unknown number of Bira, Lendu and Nande civilians during raids on the\n\nneighbourhoods of Mudzipela, Bigo and Saio. Lendu and Ngiti militiamen responded by\n\nkilling an unknown number of Hema civilians in the districts of Mudzipela, Saio, Rwambuzi\n\nand Simbiliabo. At the same time, Lendu and Ngiti militiamen killed 32 Hema civilians and\n\nwounded and mutilated an unknown number of them at a farm in the village of Lengabo, a few\n\nkilometres from Bunia. Between 9 and 11 August, elements of the UPDF and the UPC killed\n\nat least 80 Lendu, Nande and Bira civilians at the Governor’s residence, at the hospital in Bigo\n\nand at Bunia central prison. The bodies of the victims were then placed in mass graves744.\n\nPage 224\n\n412. Over the course of the following months, violent fighting broke out on several fronts,\n\nbetween elements of the UPC and UPDF on the one hand, and those of the APC and FNI-FRPI on\n\nthe other. Both coalitions targeted civilian populations on the basis of their ethnic origins.\n\nNumerous civilians from non-belligerent tribes were also massacred on the basis of their actual or\n\nsupposed support for one or other camp. Many of them were also victims of forced recruitment to\n\nthe various armed groups. The mining regions north of Bunia, control of which was seen as\n\nstrategic by the various groups involved, were the theatre for some particularly violent fighting.\n\n413. On 9 August 2002, having had to leave Bunia quickly, Governor Lopondo, the APC\n\ntroops and Lendu and Ngiti militiamen745 established a base in Komanda for the purpose of\n\npreparing the counter-offensive. The UPC, meanwhile, consolidated its positions south of Bunia in\n\norder to prevent the counter-attack from elements of the APC and FNI-FRPI and to gain control of\n\nthe area’s mining resources. In this context, the Mapping Team documented the following alleged\n\nincidents.\n\n On 9 August 2002, elements of the APC and Lendu and Ngiti militiamen killed tens of\n\ncivilians, mostly Hema, in the town of Komanda and the surrounding villages in the\n\nBasili-Basumu community, in the Irumu region. Guided by the Ngiti militiamen who had\n\ninfiltrated the village and by local youths, elements of the APC and members of the militias\n\nmoved from house to house, killing Hema civilians purely on the basis of their ethnic origin.\n\nMost of the victims were killed with edged weapons. Some were tied up and then killed with\n\nspears746.\n\n From 14 to 19 August 2002, elements of the UPC killed over 50 civilians from different ethnic\n\ngroups during an attack on the village of Komanda. Most of the victims were shot or killed\n\nwith edged weapons when they fled Komanda for Beni. Many of the victims had left Bunia a\n\nfew days previously following the takeover of the town by the UPC and had taken refuge in\n\n- 28 -\n\nKomanda. The aim of the UPC attack was to avenge the massacre committed in Komanda on\n\n9 August747.\n\nPage 225\n\n On 28 August 2002, Hema-Gegere militiamen associated with the UPC killed several tens of\n\n“non-native” inhabitants748 in the gold-producing town of Mabanga in the Mambisa\n\ncommunity, in the Djugu region. The victims were killed either with machetes or with studded\n\nbatons. Sixteen of them were clubbed to death with planks of wood. The Hema-Gegere\n\nmilitiamen associated the “non-natives” with Governor Lopondo and APC soldiers. Whilst the\n\nLendu militiamen were trying to take control of the region’s mines, the Hema-Gegere\n\nmilitiamen feared that the “non-natives” were helping them. During previous fighting in\n\nMabanga, the Lendu militiamen had systematically killed Hema civilians but had spared the\n\n“non-native” populations. After the massacre, UPDF troops intervened to provide cover for the\n\nflight of the non-natives to Bunia749.\n\n On 31 August 2002, elements of the UPC supported by Bira militiamen killed at least\n\n14 civilians, including women and children, in several villages in Songolo in the Walendu\n\nBindi community, in the Irumu region. They also carried out acts of pillaging and widespread\n\ndestruction, setting fire to over 1,000 houses. Several victims were mutilated and killed in an\n\nextremely cruel fashion. At least three women were impaled. Songolo was considered to be\n\none of the FRPI fiefdoms750.\n\n Between 5 and 15 September 2002, elements of the FRPI and APC systematically massacred\n\nover 1,000 Hema-Gegere and Bira civilians, including large numbers of children, in Nyakunde\n\nand the surrounding villages in the Andisoma community, in the Irumu region. They also\n\ncarried out numerous acts of pillaging. The victims were killed purely on the basis of their\n\nethnic origin, mostly using arrows or edged weapons. Elements of the APC and FRPI had set\n\nup road blocks so that no-one from the Hema or Bira ethnic groups was able to escape from\n\nNyakunde. FRPI militiamen sorted civilians and the soldiers there who were no longer able to\n\nfight based on their ethnic origin in the Evangelical Medical Centre. They systematically killed\n\nHema and Bira and spared the members of other ethnic groups. Numerous victims were\n\ndetained in cruel, inhuman or degrading conditions for several days before they were finally\n\nexecuted. Most of the massacres took place once the fighting with the UPC militiamen present\n\nin Nyakunde had been over for several days751.\n\nPages 226-227\n\n On 13 September 2002, elements of the FRPI from Gety killed around 150 people, including\n\nnumerous civilians, most of them Hema, in the lakeside groupement of Bandikado in the\n\nBahema–Sud community, in the Irumu region. They killed and mutilated an unknown number\n\nof people in Nyamavi, for example. They also looted the villages before leaving the\n\ngroupement. These attacks also caused several thousand people to be displaced for several\n\nyears752.\n\n On 11 October 2002, in the Djugu region, elements of the FNI from the Walendu Djatsi\n\ncommunity killed an unknown number of Alur, Hema, Bira and Nyali civilians in the mining\n\ntown of Nizi in the Mambisa community. They also killed 28 people and kidnapped 23 women\n\nin the mining area of Kilomoto. During these attacks, the militiamen mutilated numerous\n\nvictims, carried out large-scale pillaging and set fire to numerous buildings, including the\n\ncommunity offices, schools and a hospital. The victims’ bodies were buried in nine mass\n\ngraves. According to witnesses, the FNI militiamen accused inhabitants of the town from all\n\nethnic groups of supporting the UPC753.\n\n- 29 -\n\n414. Between October and December 2002, confrontations between elements of the\n\nFNI-FPRI and UPC had spread throughout the Irumu region. The UPC troops led major military\n\noperations in the same region directed at the FRPI bases in the Walendu Bindi community and\n\nLendu enclaves in the Bahema-Sud community. The Bira farmers living in Pinga, in Songo in the\n\nIrumu region were also attacked, with the UPC suspecting them of funding the FNI and FRPI. In\n\nthis context, the Mapping Team documented the following alleged incidents.\n\n Between 15 and 16 October 2002, UPC militiamen killed at least 180 people, including\n\ncivilians, in Zumbe in the Walendu Tatsi community. The militiamen also raped at least\n\n50 women. Most of the victims were killed with machetes or spears. Some were shot dead.\n\nSome survived but were badly mutilated. Having looted large amounts of property and stolen\n\n1,500 head of cattle, the UPC troops set fire to the village, destroying more than 500 buildings,\n\nincluding health centres and schools. Zumbe was an FRPI fiefdom754.\n\n On 20 October 2002, elements of the UPC from Bunia and Bogoro killed at least 10 Lendu\n\ncivilians during attacks on several villages, including Nombe, Medhu, Pinga, Kagaba, Singo\n\nand Songolo in the Walendu Bindi community, in the Irumu region. A Bira woman married to\n\na Lendu civilian was also killed. The militiamen systematically pillaged property and stole\n\ncattle belonging to Lendu in the villages they attacked755.\n\nPage 227\n\n On 24 October 2002, elements of the UPC killed several dozen Lendu in the Walendu Bindi\n\ncommunity, particularly in the villages of Nombe, Kagaba, Lakabo, Lokpa, Medhu, Songolo,\n\nPinga, Androzo and Singo. Most of the victims were killed with edged weapons. The\n\nmilitiamen also kidnapped more than 20 people, including women. They also stole some\n\n1,450 head of cattle and burned at least 351 houses, including schools and health centres756.\n\n On 5 November 2002, elements of the FRPI killed at least 14 civilians, including two women,\n\nin the village of Saliboko in the Mobala community, in the Irumu region. They also pillaged\n\nand set fire to the village. Most of the victims were Bira. They were attacked at night in their\n\nhouses. First they were tied up and then killed with machetes. Some civilians managed to\n\nescape but were often severely mutilated. The militiamen were critical of the Bira in Saliboko\n\nfor having given shelter to displaced Hema. The village has not been rebuilt since757.\n\n415. The signing of a peace agreement in September 2002 between the DRC and Uganda\n\noffered new prospects for peace in Ituri. In addition to the withdrawal of UPDF troops from\n\nGbadolite and Beni, the agreement provided for the creation of a Peacekeeping Commission in Ituri\n\nand the setting up of an Administration intérimaire de l’Ituri (AII) [Interim Administrative\n\nAuthority for Ituri] responsible for managing the district after the departure of the Ugandan\n\nsoldiers. On the ground, however, far from stabilising the region, the closer relationship between\n\nKinshasa and Kampala prompted new patterns of alliances that made the situation even more\n\nvolatile. As mentioned previously, in October 2002, the MLC army, the ALC, and its allies in the\n\nRCD-N launched a major operation east of Orientale Province, called “Clean the blackboard”.\n\nThis operation aimed to destroy the APC once and for all, so as to deprive the Government in\n\nKinshasa of its ally in eastern Congo and get hold of the natural resources still under the control of\n\nthe RCD-ML before the transition period began. The UPC, which was also trying to crush the\n\nAPC, joined in with the operation.\n\n416. On 12 October 2002, the ALC and its allies from the RCD-N entered the town of\n\nMambasa. On 29 October, however, they were forced to withdraw, before regaining control of the\n\ntown from the APC on 27 November. During the attacks, the ALC soldiers (MLC and RCD-N)\n\ncommitted numerous atrocities directed at civilians.\n\n- 30 -\n\nPage 228\n\n Between 12 and 29 October 2002, elements of the ALC and RCD-N taking part in the “Clean\n\nthe blackboard” operation allegedly killed at least 173 Nande and Pygmy civilians in Mambasa\n\nand in the villages along the main road between Mambasa and Beni, particularly in Teturi,\n\nMwemba and Byakato, in the Mambasa region. The soldiers also carried out acts of\n\ncannibalism, mutilated an unknown number of civilians, raped a large number of women and\n\nchildren and committed widespread pillaging. The victims were killed purely on the basis of\n\ntheir ethnic origin, with Nande and Pygmies accused of supporting the RCD-ML758.\n\n417. Following their victory over the APC in Mambasa, elements of the ALC/RCD-N/UPC,\n\nwith the help of UPDF soldiers, launched a major military operation in order to take control of the\n\nmining town of Mongwalu.\n\n On 20 November 2002, during their attack on Mongwalu, elements of the ALC/RCD-N/UPC\n\nare alleged to have killed at least 50 Lendu, including civilians and Lendu militiamen who\n\nwere no longer able to fight. Most of the victims were shot dead or killed with edged weapons.\n\nSome were killed whilst they were hiding in a church. Some survived but were badly mutilated\n\nand tortured759.\n\nPage 230\n\n421. On 6 March 2003, after the UPC had attacked the UPDF base in Ndele, a few\n\nkilometres from Bunia, UPDF soldiers and elements of the FNI and FRPI set up a joint military\n\noperation and regained control of the town of Bunia.\n\nPage 231\n\n On 6 March 2003, elements of the UPC and UPDF/FNI/FRPI fought each other with heavy\n\nweapons in Bunia, reportedly killing between 17 and 52 civilians. After the withdrawal of\n\nUPC troops from the town, elements of the FNI killed an unknown number of Hema civilians\n\non the basis of their ethnic origins. Elements of the UPDF/FNI/FRPI also looted and destroyed\n\nnumerous buildings, private homes and premises used by local and international NGOs.\n\nUPDF soldiers sometimes intervened to ask elements of the FNI/FRPI to stop the atrocities and\n\nleave the town769.\n\nPages 234-235\n\n429. During the period under consideration, all the armed groups in Ituri (UPC, FNI, FRPI,\n\nFAPC and PUSIC) are alleged to have recruited thousands of children along ethnic lines.\n\n Between 2001 and 2003, thousands of Hema children recruited by the UPC had undergone\n\nmilitary training in the Mandro, Katoto and Bule camps. During the training, they were often\n\ntortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading acts and raped. In 2000, at least 163 of these\n\nchildren were sent to Uganda to undergo military training at a UPDF camp in Kyankwanzi\n\nbefore finally being repatriated to Ituri by UNICEF in February 2001. Between 2002\n\nand 2003, some children associated with the UPC were kidnapped and taken to Rwanda to\n\nundergo military training in the APR camps. An unknown number of Lendu children were\n\ntaken to military training camps in North Kivu. Other communities were affected by the same\n\nphenomenon, primarily the Alur, largely in the Mahagi region782.\n\n- 31 -\n\nPage 243\n\n2. Beni and Lubero regions (Grand-Nord)\n\n442. In the Beni and Lubero regions controlled by the RCD-ML, fighting continued between\n\nthe troops from the APC (the armed wing of the RCD-ML) and the UPDF on the one hand and the\n\nvarious Mayi-Mayi groups on the other.\n\n In 2001, elements of the APC allegedly killed at least five civilians and set fire to houses in the\n\nvillage of Kiantsaba, 15 kilometres from Beni. APC soldiers and the Vurondo Mayi-Mayi had\n\nlong been in dispute over control of the village808.\n\n443. From 2001, Mayi-Mayi groups and UPDF soldiers, sometimes supported by elements\n\nof the APC, engaged in fierce fighting to gain control of the village of Irango, around 20 kilometres\n\nfrom Beni.\n\n In 2001, elements of the UPDF allegedly killed an unknown number of people in the village of\n\nIrango. The victims had been accused of supporting the Mayi-Mayi. The soldiers also raped\n\nnumerous girls. During the attack, they set fire to and looted several houses809.\n\n444. In the town of Beni, UPDF soldiers instituted a reign of terror for several years with\n\ncomplete impunity. They summarily executed civilians, tortured and arbitrarily detained an\n\nunknown number of people, several of them in muddy holes tw"
