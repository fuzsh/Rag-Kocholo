Materials and method: The study included a retrospective and prospective series. The files of patients reoperated after abdominal surgery from January 2014 to December 2019 at the general surgery department of Sino-Central African Friendship University Hospital in Bangui were analyzed. Results: Out of 1249 patients operated on and hospitalized in the surgical department and, 83 (6.6%) patients were reoperated. They were 53% male subjects. The average age was 38.4 years old. An initial intervention was carried out urgently by unqualified operators (71.1%). Postoperative peritonitis (42.2%) was the main reasons for reoperation. Time to reoperation was 8.4 days on average. The founding during reoperation was anastomotic disunity (39.8%). A bypass stoma (33.7%) associated with washing and drainage of the peritoneal cavity was performed. In 19.2% of cases, patients underwent iterative reoperation. The rate of death was 24%. Predictive factors of poor prognosis were, initial surgery for acute peritonitis, dirty surgery, patient with ASA score II and III, NISS 2 and 3, unqualified operators, iterative reoperations and digestive fistula. Conclusion: Early re-operations occurred after emergency surgery performed by an unqualified surgeon. They dependent on high mortality. To reduce rate of early reoperations and improve the prognosis, qualified surgical personnel are needed. Unqualified surgeons must be regularly retrained in essential surgical care with particular emphasis on respecting the basic principles of emergency surgery.",
