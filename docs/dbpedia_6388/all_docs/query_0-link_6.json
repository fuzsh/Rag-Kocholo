        "text": "\"When I write. I always think of the ordinary people. A writer must always seek for the truth if he is to be honest to himself and to mankind. Truth was and still is my weapon,\" Ghosh had noted.\n\nEarly work:\n\nGhosh doffed many professional hats before committing to his career as a scribe. He worked as an electrician, a waiter in Dhabas (local eateries), a salesman of pharmaceutical goods, proofreader, a member as well as a manager of a dancing group, among other odd jobs. His formal education had to end at the Intermediate level, but he rose to prominence as one of the most influential editors, writers, satirists, and novelists in Bengal despite his lack of a formal higher education.\n\nIn 1941, with only a high school education, no special skills, and his mother and sisters in Nabadwip to support, Ghosh took the first job he could find in Calcutta, as an electrician's mate. The work was not steady and paid only four annas a day (an anna or ānna was a currency unit formerly used in British India, equal to 1⁄16 of a rupee).\n\nAfter four months he found regular work as an apprentice viceman fitter with a small company where he got paid ten annas a day, he sent six of which to his mother and lived on the remaining four. He saved by eating at a Muslim restaurant for the poor where he was allowed to sleep in a corner in exchange of certain odd jobs around the place. When asked why as a Hindu he did not choose a co-religionists establishment he had responded, \"Because Hindus would ask why I was there, what my caste was and so on, but the Muslims never asked anything; they were more human.\"\n\nAs soon as he was well enough, Ghosh returned to his ancestral district of Jessore to seek work and was hired as a road sirkar (foreman) for a construction firm building a large airdrome.\n\nWORK\n\nWORK\n\nHowever, he lost that job after three months when the police discovered that he was a member of the Radical Democratic Party. He was held in custody for 15 days, and then expelled from the restricted military area.\n\nGhosh went back to Nabadwip and with the help of his maternal uncle, was admitted to the Intermediate Science Class of the wartime Nabadwip branch of Vidyasagar College of Calcutta. He disliked the classroom environment and soon stopped attending classes. But he remained active in student politics and helped form the Radical Students League.\n\nIn Calcutta, Ghosh worked briefly as a dishwasher in a restaurant and later as an agent selling pharmaceuticals, buckets, cardboard and insurance on a commission. Then he managed a touring troupe of Kathak dancers; interpreting the Kathak dances of North India to Bengali audiences, arranging travel and housing for the troupe and selling tickets for the performances.\n\nHis first poem was published in early 1940s in Purbasha (The East Horizon), a Calcutta periodical edited by Sanjay Bhattacharya. In 1944 and 1945, he occasionally contributed personal articles to his party organ Janata (The Mass). Soon his poems were published in magazines like 'Dwandwa' and various contemporary ones."
