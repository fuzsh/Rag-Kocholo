        "text": "From the Jacket :\n\nKnown variously as the last emperor in the Indian film world, a living legend, the thespian, few would contest that Dilip Kumar has been a dominant figure for over five decades in an industry where actors spring up like mushrooms and are wiped out of public memory like bubbles in water or footprints in the sand. His status as the unquestioned icon of Hindi screen is a tribute both to his star appeal among successive generations of Hindi film audiences and his acting caliber.\n\nLovingly and film-by-film, this book traces Dilip Kumar's legendary career which started by pure chance when he was barely twenty-two and with no interest in films to speak of Dilip Kumar achieved his undisputed status as India's outstanding film actor through sheer hard work and astonishing dedication. Acting in only fifty-four films i nearly as many years, Delip helped create landmark film from the 1940s to the 1990s, including Shaheed, Jogan, Devdas, Naya Daur, Mughal-e-Azam, Gunga Jumna, Sagina Mahato and Shakti, to name a few. Intensely involved in all aspects of the films he worked in, Dilip also helped direct several of them.\n\nDilip Kumar is a very private man in a very public industry. Thus, while so much has been written about him in the media there remains an aura of mystery about him. This book attempts to flesh out the person behind the star and how Dilip Kumar's cultured dignity and grace have given him a credibility which transcends the silver screen, making him a public figure who is both widely admired and respected.\n\nThe book also contains a complete filmography of Dilip Kumar and an array of photographs that chronicle his life and films.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nUrmila Lanba, a lawyer by profession, has been keenly interested in films since her childhood, Dilip Kumar's films in particular. She spent several years working on this book.\n\nCONTENTS"
