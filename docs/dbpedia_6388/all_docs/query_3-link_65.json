In the village of Dhaniakhali, the new police chief Bhuvan Sen finds corruption and decay personified by the dissolute Madhusudhan Roy Choudhury (Kumar), the zamindar’s son. However, the cause of the rot is not the persistence feudalism in the village but the presence of the sophisticated and mild-mannered Mahim Babu, cast as the villain who turns the head of Madhusudhan’s girlfriend Lekha (Tagore). The policeman eventually restores the old feudal power relations, rehabilitates the hero and restores Lekha to him. This reactionary parable was celebrated for the performance of Bengali megastar Uttam Kumar. The Hindi version has the hit song Dil aisa kisine mera toda, sung by Kishore Kumar.",
