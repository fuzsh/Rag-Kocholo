        "text": "A tribute to the amazing contributions of DadaSaheb Phalke Award winner Dilip Kumar and Icon & legend of Cinema.\n\nNaughty Romantic Dilip\n\nMovies like Kohinoor, Aan Jugnu, Leader, Ram aur Shyam had the spunky energetic youthful romantic Hero Dilip. The song from the entertaining movie Leader with the pretty Vyjantimala in front of the Taj – tere husn ki kya taareef karoon. To Nadira atop a horse and carriage in maan mera ehsaan are nadaan\n\nThey made many a heart go aflutter as he smiled and jumped around.\n\nThe cheerful serenade atop a boat with Leema Chandavarkar in Ram Aur Shyam\n\nSaare Shahr mein Aapsa koi nahi\n\nClassical dance song Madhuban mein Radhika naache re from Jugnu with the graceful Kumkum\n\nSeriously Romantic Dilip Kumar\n\nFrom Devdas to Mughle Azam to Madhumati to Sangdil. His soft dreamy voice matched his intense gaze as he looked at Madhubala or Aparna Sen. His sad intense love lorn hero, earned him the title Tragedy King.\n\nYe Hawa Ye Raat Ye Chaandni As He lipsynced soulfully in the Hindi version of the Wuthering Heights. Then again looked lost in love as Paro & Chandramukhi pine for him. Jise tu kabool kar le to the iconic Mughle Azam with once real life sweetheart Madhubala and then sways to the ethereal Madhumati and the travel song for India’s multiple generations – Suhana safar aur ye mausam haseen. To the piano song for Nargis in Andaz hum Aaj Kahin Dil kho baithe\n\nThe Protagonist Dilip Kumar\n\nFrom Naya Daur to Sagina Mahato to Shakti & Karma.\n\nHe was believable as the young and then the old man who was willing to put all on the line for a social commitment.\n\nHis best songs and dances were in these movies. As he shook an enviable hip in Nain lad jaiyehen to sala main to sahab ban gaya to har karam apna karenge\n\nThe legend lives on of the authentic inimitable Dilip Kumar."
