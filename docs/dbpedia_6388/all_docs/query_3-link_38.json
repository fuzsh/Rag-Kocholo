        "text": "Dilip Kumar’s life is nothing less than a leaf from some of his films. It’s indeed a miracle that a former fruit merchant went on to become India’s greatest actor. His father Lala Ghulam Sarwar owned orchards near Nashik. In the 30s the family moved to Pune. Born as Yusuf Khan in Peshawar on December 11, 1922, it’s said that it was Devika Rani who spotted him at Pune’s military canteen. She told him to come to Mumbai and offered him his first film Jwar Bhata (1944). He was a method actor before the term came in vogue in Hindi cinema and made sure each role challenged his talents. He was also cannily aware that over-exposure can kill the audience’s response and never signed every film that came his way. Like most of his onscreen avatars, he remained an unrequited lover in real life till he was in his 40s. Kamini Kaushal, allegedly the first great love of his life remained unattainable as she was already married. Madhubala, with whom he was said to be secretly engaged broke off all ties with him when he sided with BR Chopra after the producer filed a breach of contract case against her. He finally married Saira Banu in 1966. He was 44 at the time and she was just 22. The actor has as many as 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Actor (Daag, Azaad, Devdas, Naya Daur, Kohinoor, Leader, Ram Aur Shyam, Shakti). His other Filmfare trophies include Lifetime Achievement Award given in 1994 and a Special Award for contribution to cinema in 2004.\n\nWe take a look at his magnanimous career and the masterpieces he's created\n\nJwar Bhata (1944)\n\nDirector Amiya Chakraborty didn’t know he was about to help give birth to a legend when he cast newbie Dilip Kumar at the behest of Devika Rani for this four handkerchief melodrama. The film is a primer for ‘How to take the audience go through an emotional roller coaster’. The film didn’t do well but the lanky, good looking star got noticed by the masses and filmmakers alike. Reigning superstar Ashok Kumar finally had a contender.\n\nAndaz (1949)\n\nThis was perhaps the first blockbuster multi-starrer, what with two up and coming superstars, Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor and marquee queen Nargis coming together in a love triangle. It may look childish now but director Mehboob Khan did make a very modern film for its times. It was hailed as a mirror to the convent-educated English speaking generation where girls openly flirted with boys. Dilip Kumar continued his tragedian onslaughts and reigned supreme as the bitter suitor whose love goes unrequited.\n\nJogan (1950)\n\nFans of Shah Rukh Khan must watch Jogan as they will catch glimpses of a young SRK in Dilip Kumar’s mannerisms, his hairstyle, his walk, his aggressive wooing of the heroine. Nargis plays a jogan (someone who has cast off earthly pursuits and pleasures and has devoted herself to God) while Dilip plays an atheist who lives for the moment (shades of Devdas here). Dilip’s cynicism collides with Nargis’s faith and the result is a film where the hero and the heroine look at each other with burning intensity but there’s no happy ending.\n\nDeedar (1951)\n\nTragedy found a new king. Dilip plays a blind singer who is cured by Ashok, a doctor. The twist in the tale is that they both love the same girl (Nargis). She’s his childhood sweetheart who doesn’t remember him, not even when he sings the song they crooned together as children. He vainly hopes that his restored vision would help restore her memories but sadly that doesn’t happen. Angered, he blinds himself in his grief.\n\nSangdil (1952)\n\nJane Eyre, anybody? Sangdil is an adaptation of Charlotte Bronte’s classic novel. Dilip plays a brooding Rochester to Madhubala’s spirited Jane. Charlotte would have enjoyed watching this song and dance melodrama with her sisters. The two actors looked made for each other and it’s said that their romance first blossomed on the sets of Sangdil.\n\nFoot Path (1953)\n\nThis is perhaps the most realistic film Dilip Kumar did. Director Zia Sarhadi, who had Marxist leanings, dreamt up a social noir film where the hero is a black marketeer. He has a change of heart towards the end and confesses all to the police. The film’s brooding realism was contrary to what Dilip had done earlier or since.\n\nAan (1953)\n\nThis was director Mehboob Khan’s swashbuckling adventure made in colour which vowed even the Western audience with its opulence. It’s said that Hollywood offers came his way after its release but he famously declined, preferring to be a Prince of all he surveyed than a commoner on foreign shores. One of the costliest films of its time in terms of production values, it surprised viewers, used to his tragic avatars, when they saw their favourite hero as an alpha male. He rode horses, fought sword duels, outwitted the villains and tamed the pretty shrew played by Nadira. Dilip Kumar came to be known as a complete entertainer, a superstar after Aan.\n\nAmar (1954)\n\nIt’s perhaps Mehboob Khan’s finest outing as a director, where he showcased that man isn’t all black and white but composed of shades of grey. Dilip’s eyes, his manners convey the shock, resentment, confusion, guilt and remorse of a man who raped an innocent in a weak moment. He tries to come to term with his crime. Madhubala plays his fiancée who helps bring closure while Nimmi brilliantly played the village girl raped by a man whom she loved with all her heart.\n\nAzaad (1955)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the psychiatrists wanted Dilip Kumar to do light-hearted roles and the result was this swashbuckling adventure. The tragic hero was transformed into a Robin Hood character who is also a master of disguises. He uses guile and charm to outwit the villain and woo the heroine played by Meena Kumari who too seemed glad to be out of her three handkerchief roles.\n\nDevdas (1955)\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. Devdas had been made before but Saratbabu’s story was waiting for its most definitive narration by the finest actor-director duo of the era. Bimal Roy and Dilip Kumar provided a feast fit for gods and made the viewers forget their own petty pains and sufferings as they became one with the grief of Devdas, Dilip Kumar played a man driven by unrequited love into being a drunkard to perfection. His eyes are hazy throughout the film and his silences are eloquent. He got so much under the skin of the character that it’s said he had to go to London and consult Harley Street psychiatrists to overcome depression.\n\nNaya Daur (1957)\n\nMan Vs Machine was the theme of this pioneering film which made you question the price of progress. Director BR Chopra’s socialist strand was ever present in this humanist drama. Dilip played the rustic tangewala to perfection, flirting outrageously with his firebrand heroine Vyjayanthimala. OP Nayyar made a mark with his music and gave the trademark tangewaala song, Maang ke saath tumhara to this film too. Strangely, this was reportedly his only outing with Dilip Kumar. The film’s core story and motifs were later copied by Ashutosh Gowariker in Lagaan.\n\nMadhumati (1958)\n\nThis Bimal Roy classic superbly employs the theme of reincarnation. You enjoy the film despite the clichés because of the atmosphere created by the director and excellent performances by both Dilip and Vyjayanthimala. Roy creates hints and red herrings like a master illusionist. In the Aaja re pardesi number, Dilip doesn’t catch a glimpse of Vyjayanthimala and is left to play hide and seek with her voice. The film’s chilling climax was faithfully recreated by Farah Khan in Om Shanti Om. Roy decided to go for a soft ending and got the star-crossed lovers united in the end, thus giving some respite to the distraught nerves of the viewers.\n\nYahudi (1958)\n\nYou can’t believe this is a Bimal Roy film as it is far removed from what he had done before or since. The beginning reminds you of Ben Hur and both films share the theme of prosecution of the Jews by the Romans. But unlike Ben Hur which was basically about Christ’s teachings, here the story revolved around a roman prince who falls in love with a Jewish girl and disguises himself as a Jew in order to win her love. Bimal subtly pointed out that religion was just an accident of birth and humanity transcends religious scruples. Dilip Kumar is convincing as Prince Marcus and Meena Kumari ably supports him as his doomed lover Hannah.\n\nKohinoor (1960)\n\nHis antics in this comic caper could put Buster Keaton to shame. Dilip and Meena Kumar played prince and princess respectively of warring kingdoms who fall in love and win over their union through much swordplay and other swashbuckling techniques. It had great music by Naushad. Gems like Madhuban mein Radhika naache re (Dilip Kumar reportedly learnt to play the guitar to lend authenticity to the song) and Do sitaron ka zameen par hai milan regale us even today.\n\nMughal-E-Azam (1960)\n\nDirected by K Asif, Mughal-e-Azam remains our grandest epic. Everything else just pales in comparison. It took the beleaguered director more than a decade to finish the film. It was frought by controversies from the start. The original cast of Nargis, Sapru and Chandramohan gave way to Madhubala, Dilip Kumar and Prithviraj Kapoor. Madubala and Dilip Kumar, who play star-crossed lovers in the film, had a very public break up in real life and weren’t even on talking terms with each other while shooting for the film. It’s said that the famous feather sequence was shot without a word being exchanged between the stars. It’s a tribute to their histrionics that it remains one of the most romantic scenes in the history of Indian cinema. Dilip Kumar, in keeping with the nature of a prince, was regally restrained and conveyed more through his eyes than others would with their facial expressions.\n\nGunga Jumna (1961)\n\nThough the credited director is Nitin Bose, it’s widely believed that Dilip Kumar himself directed this film. The film borrowed elements from Mother India and was the precursor for stories like Deewaar and many other films where one brother turns an outlaw while the other is a policeman. Dililp Kumar was excellent as the rustic villager forced by circumstances to become a dacoit. The film was made in a rural dialect of Hindi and Naushad and Shakeel Badayuni retained the flavour in the music and lyrics respectively.\n\nLeader (1964)\n\nThe film was a critique on corrupt politicians and one sees that nothing has changed since then. This is perhaps Dilip Kumar’s most over-the-top performance but he doesn’t lose our attention. He outclassed everyone else with his split-second comedy. His vigorous wooing of the heroine is something we were more accustomed to seeing in a certain Mr Shammi Kapoor. It’s also a tale about a young man finding his ideals and purpose and Dilip’s mannerisms change from the absurd to the sublime as his character finds his bearings.\n\nRam Aur Shyam (1967)\n\nThis was perhaps Dilip Kumar’s last big hit as a solo star and what can be more fitting than the fact that he played a double role in the film? It’s to his credit that he was able to infuse two different personalities to the roles. Basically it was the story of twins separated at birth. Shyam grows up to be street smart man-about-town while Ram is a bumpkin much abused by his brother-in-law. Things are set right when the duo by chance exchange places. The formula proved so successful that it was remade numerous times as Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), Chaalbaaz (1989) and Kishan Kanhaiya (1990).\n\nAadmi (1968)\n\nA remake of the Tamil film Aalayamani (1962), this melodrama had revenge, jealousy, suffering and redemption in large doses. This was the first time Manoj Kumar got to act with his ideal Dilip and he looks much in awe in most scenes. Waheeda Rahman as their joint love interest lends able support. The film is indeed a study in the mercurial nature of man but is undertaken in such a ham-handed way that you tend to lose the subtext.\n\nDastaan (1972)\n\nIt’s said that BR Chopra wanted to make this film eons ago with Dilip but couldn’t. So it went to Ashok Kumar and the result was Afsana (1951). Maybe the actor had a change of heart and decided to indulge the director and so Chopra went on to reprise his own whodunit. There were minor changes in the story. The earlier film was more a love triangle and the latter was like a Hitchcock thriller. It remains a nice enough film where you get to see Dilip play both the white and the grey shaded characters with aplomb.\n\nSagina (1974)\n\nBased on Bengali writer-activist Gour Kishore Ghosh’s account of another activist colleague, Sagina is the Hindi remake of the Bengali film Sagina Mahato (1971). Both films had the same lead pair, Dilip and Saira Banu. The star was in his fifth decade when the film was released but his acting showed no sign of aging. His portrayal of a free-spirited man governed by chance to become the leader of the oppressed remains one of his best performances.\n\nShakti (1982)\n\nThis arguably is Ramesh Sippy’s finest film. It brought together current superstar Amitabh Bachchan face-to-face with his ideal and idol Dilip Kumar. The son is unable to come to grips with his policeman father’s unwavering integrity and takes to crime. The father is duty bound to catch the son and yet there is a bond between them despite the differences that remain. The actors provided gravitas to a plot borrowed from the Ashok Kumar starrer Sangram (1950) and the end scene where Amitabh is dying in Dilip’s lap remains a masterpiece. You can feel a father’s anguish, his anger and the momentary joy that though dying, his son has finally reconciled their differences.\n\nMashaal (1984)\n\nDirected by Yash Chopra, it has Dilip Kumar as an angry old man who, troubled by the corrupt system, first starts a newspaper that targets corruption and is later forced by circumstances to take up arms. Anil Kapoor stars as his protégé. Dilip Kumar who was in his 60s at the time gave an understated performance of an anguished man who turns his anger into a weapon.\n\nKarma (1986)\n\nKarma was Sholay (1975) as envisioned by Subhash Ghai. Dilip Kumar played a police officer whose family is killed by the villains, so he hires three convicts (Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff and Naseeruddin Shah) to exact his revenge. It was one of the rare films where Dilip was paired with Nutan (the duo strangely were never paired during their heyday) and it’s a delight to see them flirting on screen."
