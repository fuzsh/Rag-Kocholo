        "text": "Category: Bollywood\n\nMalayalam Movie Artists Association Faces Collapse Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations, Mass Resignations Follow\n\nThe Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) is facing a major crisis following the release of findings by the Justice Hema Committee and the subsequent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against several prominent male members. The situation reached a tipping point on Tuesday, when the entire leadership of AMMA, including its president and executive committee members, submitted their resignations.\n\nMalayalam film superstar Mohanlal, who held the position of president, led the mass resignation by stepping down from his role. The rest of the executive committee also followed suit, submitting their resignations in a collective decision to step down. This move comes as a direct response to the severe criticism and allegations that have been levied against several members of the association.\n\nIn a statement issued by AMMA, the association explained the reasons behind their decision: “AMMA has decided to disperse the executive committee on moral grounds in the light of allegations made by some actors against some of the committee members. A new committee will be formed after an election within two months,” according to a report from a leading media house. This statement highlights the association’s intent to rebuild trust and take corrective measures in response to the ongoing scandal.\n\nThe resignation of the executive committee members marks a significant development in the unfolding controversy. Among those who resigned are the vice presidents, Jayan Cherthala and Jagadish, as well as the joint secretary, Baburaj. Other resigning members include treasurer Unni Mukundan and a number of executive committee members: Ansiba Hassan, Sarayu Mohan, Vinu Mohan, Tini Tom, Ananya, Suresh Krishna, KalabhavanShajohn, Suraj Venjaramoodu, Jomol, Joy Mathew, and Tovino Thomas.\n\nThe crisis began escalating when senior actor Siddique resigned from his position as the general secretary of AMMA on Sunday. His resignation came just a day after a prominent actress accused him of raping her when she was young. This shocking allegation prompted Siddique’s resignation and triggered a wave of similar accusations against other members of the association. In addition to Siddique, actors Baburaj and Mukesh were also accused by survivors of sexual harassment.\n\nThe association’s response to the allegations and its subsequent actions have been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism. On Monday, actor Prithviraj Sukumaran openly criticized AMMA for its inadequate response to the complaints made by survivors. His comments were particularly directed towards the association’s handling of a complaint made by his “Avan Chandiyude Makan” co-star, Sridevika, against director Thulasidas. Prithviraj expressed his disappointment with AMMA’s inaction, stating, “Stronger intervention and actions are needed from AMMA.”\n\nThe resignation of the entire executive committee signifies a significant turning point for AMMA, which has long been one of the most influential bodies in the Malayalam film industry. The allegations have not only caused reputational damage but have also raised serious questions about the association’s ability to effectively address and manage such serious issues within the industry.\n\nThe mass resignation is being viewed as a necessary step towards reforming the organization and addressing the underlying issues that have led to the current crisis. It also underscores the need for greater accountability and transparency within the organization. With the promise of a new committee to be formed following elections within the next two months, there is hope that the association can rebuild itself and work towards creating a safer and more equitable environment for all its members.\n\nThe fallout from these resignations is expected to be significant, with the association likely to undergo a period of intense scrutiny and reform. The new leadership will face the challenging task of restoring trust and confidence in the organization, both among its members and the general public. This situation also highlights the broader issues of sexual misconduct and harassment in the film industry, not just in Malayalam cinema but across all film industries, where similar issues have often been reported but not adequately addressed.\n\nAs the association moves towards electing new leadership, it remains to be seen how these changes will impact the industry as a whole. The outcome of this crisis will likely serve as a critical test for AMMA and its commitment to safeguarding the rights and dignity of its members, especially the women who have come forward with allegations of misconduct.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent developments within AMMA reflect a moment of reckoning for the association and the Malayalam film industry. The mass resignation of its office bearers, led by president Mohanlal, marks the beginning of a new chapter that will hopefully bring about meaningful change and a renewed commitment to ethical governance. As the organization prepares for its upcoming elections, the focus will be on selecting leaders who are committed to addressing these serious issues and fostering a culture of respect and safety within the industry.\n\nStree 2 Becomes a Box Office Sensation, Earning Over Rs 500 Crore Globally\n\nThe horror comedy Stree 2, featuring Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor, has surpassed Rs 500 crore in global gross box office earnings. The film’s producers, Maddock Films, announced the achievement on Sunday. Directed by Amar Kaushik and produced by Dinesh Vijan of Maddock Films, Stree 2 is a sequel to the 2018 hit movie Stree.\n\nMaddock Films took to their X page to share the impressive box office numbers. According to their post, Stree 2 has grossed Rs 426 crore in India and an additional Rs 78.5 crore from international markets. This brings the total worldwide gross collection to approximately Rs 505 crore. The film’s domestic net box office earnings are reported to be Rs 361 crore.\n\nReleased on August 15, Stree 2 faced stiff competition at the box office from Nikkhil Advani’s Vedaa, starring Sharvari and John Abraham, and Mudassar Aziz’s Khel Khel Mein, featuring Akshay Kumar. Despite the competition, Stree 2 emerged as the top-grossing film among the three, showcasing its strong audience appeal and popularity.\n\nThe movie, penned by Niren Bhatt, also features notable performances from Aparshakti Khurana, Pankaj Tripathi, and Abhishek Banerjee. Stree 2 is part of Maddock Films’ expanding horror-comedy universe, which includes other popular films like Bhediya and Munjya.\n\nThe film’s success adds to the growing popularity of the horror-comedy genre in Indian cinema. Stree 2 has managed to capture the audience’s attention with its unique blend of humor and horror, continuing the legacy of its predecessor, Stree, which was also a box office success. The impressive box office performance of Stree2 highlights the film’s appeal across different demographics and regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe makers of Stree 2 expressed their gratitude to the audience for their overwhelming support and appreciation for the film. “We are thrilled with the response that Stree 2 has received from audiences worldwide,” Maddock Films stated. “The film’s success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire team, and we are grateful to the audience for their love and support.”\n\nThe film’s success is also a significant achievement for Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor, who have been praised for their performances. Their chemistry on screen, coupled with the film’s engaging storyline and well-crafted humor, has resonated well with viewers. The supporting cast, including Aparshakti Khurana, Pankaj Tripathi, and Abhishek Banerjee, has also been lauded for their contributions to the film’s success.\n\nStree 2 is not just a commercial success but also a cultural phenomenon, drawing in audiences who are looking for fresh and innovative storytelling. The film has set a new benchmark for horror comedies in Indian cinema, proving that this genre has a vast potential for creative exploration.\n\nAs Stree 2 continues its successful run at the box office, it remains to be seen how the film’s achievements will influence future projects within Maddock Films’ horror-comedy universe. With the success of Stree 2, the production house is likely to continue investing in similar projects that offer a blend of horror and humor, catering to a broad audience base.\n\nThe film’s producers have hinted at the possibility of expanding the horror-comedy universe further, with potential sequels and spin-offs in the pipeline. “The response to Stree 2 has been overwhelming, and we are excited about the future prospects of this genre,” said Dinesh Vijan of Maddock Films. “We are committed to delivering quality content that entertains and engages audiences, and we have some exciting projects lined up.”\n\nStree 2 has set a new standard for horror comedies in Indian cinema, proving that the genre has significant commercial appeal. With its strong box office performance and positive audience feedback, the film has established itself as a major success story, paving the way for more films in the horror-comedy space. The success of Stree 2 underscores the importance of innovative storytelling and creative experimentation in Indian cinema, and its impact is likely to be felt for years to come.\n\nAllegations of Sexual Misconduct Shake Malayalam Film Industry as Key Figures Resign\n\nThe Malayalam film industry is facing significant turmoil following the release of the Justice K. Hema committee’s report on issues confronting women in the industry. The controversy escalated on Sunday, August 25, 2024, with the resignations of two prominent figures. Under mounting pressure from the Opposition and the film community, the Kerala government has established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into multiple sexual harassment allegations against actors.\n\nActor Siddique resigned as the general secretary of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) after being accused of sexual assault by a young actress. Concurrently, Kerala State Chalachitra Academy chairperson Ranjith stepped down following allegations of inappropriate behavior made by Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra.\n\nThe Hema Committee’s report has stirred intense debates in the public domain, seemingly encouraging more women to come forward with their experiences of harassment. Over the past few days, several women, including Sreelekha Mitra and the young actress, have publicly accused various actors and filmmakers of misconduct.\n\nSiddique confirmed his resignation to The Hindu, stating that he had submitted his resignation letter to Mohanlal, AMMA’s president, due to the allegations against him. “I submitted the resignation voluntarily since it is inappropriate to continue in that position when I am facing such an allegation. No one demanded for my resignation. Let the truth come out,” said Siddique. He added that he would respond in detail after receiving legal counsel.\n\nThe young actress detailed her accusations against Siddique during a media interaction on Saturday evening. She claimed that Siddique had contacted her through social media, offering a role in a Tamil film in which his son would also be acting. Trusting his intentions because he addressed her as “daughter,” she traveled to Thiruvananthapuram to pursue the offer. However, she described it as a trap, alleging that the film did not exist and that Siddique sexually assaulted her in a hotel room for an hour. “He hit and kicked me when I resisted. Some of my friends too had similar experiences from him. I had to give up my dreams and go through a lot of mental health issues,” she said.\n\nSiddique’s resignation came just two days after he addressed the media with AMMA’s initial response to the Hema committee report, during which he asserted that the organization had not received any complaints about a ‘casting couch.’\n\nShortly after Siddique’s resignation, Ranjith also announced his decision to step down. He confirmed to The Hindu that he had submitted his resignation to Kerala’s Minister for Cultural Affairs, Saji Cherian. In a voice message to the media, Ranjith explained that he did not want the allegations against him to be used to tarnish the State government’s image, which had appointed him. He expressed confidence that the truth would eventually come to light and indicated that he would respond to the accusations legally.\n\nSreelekha Mitra accused Ranjith of behaving inappropriately with her during the pre-production of the 2009 Malayalam film *Paleri Manikyam: OruPathirakolapathakathinteKatha.* Her allegations were supported by documentary filmmaker Joshy Joseph, who stated that she had confided in him about the incident on the same day. Although Ranjith denied the allegations, he acknowledged that she had met him during an audition for the role in the presence of other crew members.\n\nThe accusations against Ranjith, first made public on Friday, August 22, 2024, led to intense pressure on the State government from various quarters, including the film industry, the Opposition, and even members of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), to demand his resignation. However, Minister Cherian had initially defended Ranjith, emphasizing that an acclaimed filmmaker like him could not be punished solely based on accusations. Cherian indicated that strong action would be taken only if a formal complaint was lodged.\n\nBy Sunday, August 25, 2024, Minister Cherian announced that the government would accept Ranjith’s resignation as soon as it was submitted. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also staged a protest march to Ranjith’s residence in Kozhikode on Sunday, demanding his resignation.\n\nThe ongoing controversy has not only led to the resignations of Siddique and Ranjith but has also implicated other prominent figures in the Malayalam film industry. Several women have accused former AMMA general secretary Edavela Babu, along with actors Mukesh, Sudheesh, and Riyas Khan, of sexual harassment or misconduct. These public revelations reportedly forced the State government to reconsider its earlier stance that it required a formal complaint or legally substantiated evidence to take action on the allegations and the Hema Committee report.\n\nThe situation has ignited a political storm in Kerala, with the Opposition accusing the government of shielding those responsible for sexual violence by failing to act on the report, which was submitted almost four years ago. The Opposition is now preparing to escalate pressure on the government by initiating legal proceedings in response to the allegations.\n\nIn response to the growing controversy, the Kerala government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a preliminary investigation into the sexual harassment allegations. The SIT, led by Inspector General G. Sparjan Kumar, includes four senior women police officers and will carry out the inquiry under Section 173 (1) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. This section mandates that a woman police officer should record the information provided by a woman who has been subjected to or faced an attempt of sexual offenses.\n\nThe SIT’s formation reflects the government’s response to the mounting pressure to take decisive action following the release of the Hema Committee report and the subsequent wave of allegations. As the investigation unfolds, the Malayalam film industry and the political landscape of Kerala are likely to remain in the spotlight, with many closely watching the developments that will follow.\n\nMalayalam Film Industry Faces Intense Scrutiny Over Gender Discrimination and Abuse Following Hema Committee Report\n\nThe Malayalam film industry, an integral part of India’s cinematic landscape, is under intense scrutiny following the release of the Hema Committee report. This report has exposed issues of sexual abuse, gender discrimination, and the inhuman treatment of women that have long been concealed. It has reignited discussions about the pervasive influence of powerful men in suppressing women in Kerala, often referred to as “God’s own country.” The report’s findings highlight a disturbing reality where women’s voices are silenced, and justice remains elusive. The perpetrators are often shielded by government institutions, further complicating the pursuit of justice.\n\nThe Hema Committee report exposes a troubling culture of silence within the Malayalam film industry. Women, from junior artists to well-established actresses, have faced sexual harassment, exploitation, and discrimination, with little to no recourse to justice. The report has documented instances where women were coerced into providing sexual favors in exchange for work. Directors and producers who wield significant power have fostered an environment where compliance is rewarded, while resistance leads to ostracization across the industry. This dynamic was starkly evident in the case of actress Bhavana, who was blacklisted by the industry. Meanwhile, efforts were made by influential figures in the industry to reinstate actor Dileep, who was alleged to be the mastermind behind a serious offense.\n\nFear is a significant factor sustaining this culture—fear of losing employment, public shaming, and physical harm. Women who dare to speak out against their abusers often face severe consequences. This fear is intensified by the criminal influence within the industry, where powerful men are known to use their connections with gangs and the mafia to suppress any attempts at holding them accountable.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets and changing rooms for women, has further exacerbated their plight. Female artists are forced to endure harsh working conditions, with no avenues to voice their grievances or seek redress. This neglect is not merely a result of gender discrimination; it reflects a deeper issue where women’s rights and dignity are routinely ignored.\n\nThe Kerala government’s handling of the Hema Committee report exemplifies how governmental actions can inadvertently suppress women’s rights. The report, submitted four years ago, was only recently made public, and even then, significant portions were redacted. These redactions, which exceeded the recommendations of the Kerala State Information Commissioner, have led to suspicions regarding the government’s intentions. The omitted sections reportedly contained details about prominent individuals in the industry who have been involved in sexual harassment over the years.\n\nThe media response to the Hema Committee report has been mixed. While some outlets have reported on its findings, others have remained silent. This selective reporting perpetuates the culture of silence, ultimately denying justice to the victims.\n\nSociety also plays a role in sustaining this culture of suppression. The stigma surrounding sexual harassment and the tendency to blame victims rather than perpetrators discourage women from coming forward. This victim-blaming mentality is deeply ingrained in our society, where women who report sexual harassment are often accused of seeking attention or attempting to ruin a man’s career.\n\nGovernments, through their policies and actions, have the power to challenge or reinforce the status quo. In many cases, they have chosen the latter, allowing powerful men to continue their abusive behavior with impunity. This is evident in the lack of enforcement of laws designed to protect women from sexual harassment and the slow pace of legal proceedings. For instance, in the Malayalam film industry, the government has been slow to act on the findings of the Hema Committee report, allowing the culture of abuse to persist unchecked.\n\nThe Indian government has enacted several laws aimed at protecting women from sexual harassment, such as the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. However, implementing these laws has been inconsistent, and many women in the film industry are unaware of their rights. This lack of awareness, combined with the fear of retaliation, means that many cases of sexual harassment go unreported. Victims often face barriers in accessing justice, including a lack of legal representation, a slow and cumbersome judicial process, and the stigma associated with being a public figure.\n\nThe Hema Committee report makes several recommendations to address the issues faced by women in the Malayalam film industry. The report suggests the mandatory establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICC) under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. These committees should include members from the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) and the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) to ensure that complaints are handled impartially and with the necessary expertise.\n\nSome committee members have proposed creating an independent tribunal to handle cases of harassment and discrimination within the cinema industry. This tribunal would operate with in-camera proceedings to ensure complete privacy for the victims, with their identities being withheld from media reports. Establishing a tribunal could provide a safe and supportive environment for victims to seek justice without fear of public scrutiny or professional backlash.\n\nThe report also recommends that written contracts be made mandatory for all categories of employees, including coordinators of junior artists. These contracts would protect workers’ rights by clearly outlining the terms of employment, including remuneration, working hours, and conditions. Written contracts would also serve as a legal safeguard against exploitation, ensuring that all parties are held accountable to the agreed terms.\n\nTo address the underlying issues of sexism and gender discrimination, the report suggests that all cast and crew members should attend a basic gender awareness training program before the start of production. These programs would educate industry professionals on gender equality, sexual harassment, and respectful workplace behavior.\n\nThe report emphasizes the need for greater representation of women in key decision-making roles within the industry, particularly as producers. To achieve this, it recommends providing adequate and timely budgetary support to incentivize films that promote gender justice both thematically and in their production processes. A single-window system could be established to provide loans at nominal interest rates for films produced by women, streamlining permissions for shooting and making it easier for women to enter the industry.\n\nBy encouraging more women to take on producer roles, the industry can shift towards creating a more inclusive and safe environment. This change could pave the way for a more equitable and just future for women in the Malayalam film industry, ensuring their rights and dignity are upheld.\n\nA. R. Rahman Unveils Soundtrack for Groundbreaking VR Film ‘Le Musk’\n\nOscar-winning composer A. R. Rahman has released the soundtrack for his latest project, the film ‘Le Musk’. This album comprises 12 tracks, blending a mix of ethereal compositions, jazz, orchestral, and eclectic elements, designed to take listeners on a sensory journey.\n\n‘Le Musk’ is not just any film—it’s a virtual reality (VR) thriller that Rahman himself wrote, directed, and co-produced. The film features actors Nora Arnezeder, Guy Burnet, Munirih Grace, and Mariam Zohrabyan. ‘Le Musk’ aims to offer an innovative cinematic experience by merging music, fragrance, and visual storytelling to engage audiences in an entirely new way.\n\nDiscussing the soundtrack, Rahman expressed, “Music is the heartbeat of ‘Le Musk’. It carries the soul of the film, guiding the audience through an emotional and sensory journey. The film is a labor of a lot of hard work and love, where we tried to push the boundaries of how we use technology to create something truly immersive.” He further added, “I am thrilled to finally share this soundtrack with the world and offer a glimpse into the world we’ve created.”\n\n‘Le Musk’ has already been showcased at prestigious venues such as Cannes XR, Los Angeles, and Toronto, generating considerable buzz. The film’s story explores themes of love, memory, and sensory exploration, and its soundtrack echoes these motifs, promising a unique listening experience for both dedicated Rahman fans and those new to his work.\n\nThe album is a collaborative effort, featuring contributions from various artists, including Nora Arnezeder, Sana Moussa, Linda Lind, Mayssa Karaa, Hiral Viradia, Simona Gilbert, The Firdaus Orchestra, and the Budapest Orchestra. The soundtrack also highlights the involvement of award-winning music engineer Greg Penny, whose expertise further elevates the project.\n\nReleased under the label of Believe Music, the soundtrack of ‘Le Musk’ is expected to make waves in the music world. Rahman’s recent album, ‘Amar Singh Chamkila’, was also a major success, further establishing his prowess in the industry. For that album, Rahman collaborated with director Imtiaz Ali, lyricist Irshad Kamil, and singer Mohit Chauhan—a team often celebrated as the “dream team” for their previous successes like ‘Rockstar’ and ‘Tamasha’.\n\nThe 12 tracks in the ‘Le Musk’ album are crafted to resonate with the film’s story, enhancing the overall experience of the movie. For Rahman, who is known for pushing creative boundaries, this soundtrack is another step forward in his illustrious career. The fusion of different musical styles in the album reflects Rahman’s vision of creating a soundscape that is both innovative and deeply connected to the narrative of the film.\n\nIn ‘Le Musk’, Rahman explores the use of VR technology to its fullest potential. By combining music, scent, and visuals, the film seeks to create a multi-sensory experience that is groundbreaking in the world of cinema. Rahman’s dedication to exploring new technological frontiers is evident in this project, which has been years in the making.\n\nThe release of the soundtrack marks a significant milestone in the film’s journey, providing audiences with a taste of what to expect from the full VR experience. The album’s diverse range of tracks, from orchestral pieces to more eclectic sounds, mirrors the complexity and depth of the film’s narrative.\n\nRahman’s ability to collaborate with a wide range of artists is also showcased in this album. The inclusion of both established and emerging talents adds a fresh dimension to the soundtrack, making it a rich and varied listening experience. The presence of orchestras like The Firdaus and Budapest Orchestra adds a grand, cinematic quality to the music, while the individual contributions of artists like Nora Arnezeder and Mayssa Karaa bring a personal, emotive touch to the tracks.\n\nThe involvement of Greg Penny, a seasoned music engineer known for his work with top-tier artists, ensures that the technical quality of the soundtrack is on par with its creative ambition. Penny’s expertise in sound engineering has been instrumental in bringing Rahman’s vision to life, adding layers of depth and clarity to the music that are essential for a VR film of this scale.\n\nAs the soundtrack gains attention, it is likely to draw listeners into the world of ‘Le Musk’ even before they experience the film itself. The music serves as an entry point into the narrative, setting the stage for the immersive experience that Rahman and his team have crafted.\n\nRahman’s work on ‘Le Musk’ reflects his ongoing commitment to innovation in music and film. His ability to seamlessly blend different genres and styles, while also incorporating cutting-edge technology, has made him one of the most respected and influential figures in the industry.\n\nThe soundtrack of ‘Le Musk’ is expected to resonate with audiences long after the film’s release. Its combination of musical diversity, technical excellence, and emotional depth makes it a standout project in Rahman’s already impressive body of work.\n\nA. R. Rahman’s latest project, ‘Le Musk’, is not just a film, but an experience that transcends traditional boundaries. The soundtrack plays a crucial role in this, offering a preview of the sensory journey that awaits viewers. As Rahman continues to explore new creative avenues, ‘Le Musk’ stands as a testament to his vision and dedication to pushing the limits of what is possible in music and film.\n\nWorld Photography Day: A Celebration of Capturing Moments and Embracing Art\n\nWorld Photography Day, celebrated annually on August 19, pays tribute to the art, craft, science, and history of photography. Photography has evolved into one of the most captivating art forms, inspiring photographers globally to share images that encapsulate their unique perspectives. This day serves as a platform for photographers to connect with others by showcasing a single shot that captures the essence of their world.\n\nSeerat Kapoor, an actress known for her role as Mannat in the television show *Rabb Se Hai Dua*, shared her deep connection with photography. She explained, “Photography is more than just a hobby for me; it’s a way to connect with the world around me.” Seerat emphasized that for her, photography is a means of capturing moments that resonate on a personal level. She enjoys photographing a wide range of subjects, from the intricate details of a flower petal to the vibrant hues of a busy street. The act of holding a camera during an evening walk through nature provides her with a sense of serenity and peace. She described the experience as meditative, allowing her to slow down, appreciate the present, and find tranquility amid the chaos of daily life.\n\nSeerat’s passion for photography is evident in her approach to capturing the beauty of the world around her. Whether it’s the delicate patterns found in nature or the dynamic colors of urban life, she finds joy in documenting these fleeting moments. For her, photography is not just about taking pictures; it’s about being present in the moment and finding peace in the process. The practice allows her to connect with her surroundings on a deeper level, offering a form of therapy and mindfulness.\n\nBeyond her love for photography, Seerat also discussed her challenging yet fulfilling journey in portraying Mannat, a character that is quite different from her real self. She reflected on how her role in *Rabb Se Hai Dua* has been both demanding and rewarding. “Portraying Mannat has been an incredible journey. Her evolution from a loving sister to a character filled with jealousy and deceit has been challenging yet immensely rewarding,” she shared.\n\nSeerat highlighted the difficulties of portraying a character so different from her own personality. Mannat’s transformation into a more complex and darker character has required Seerat to tap into emotions and motivations that are far removed from her everyday life. She admitted that portraying Mannat on-screen every day can be tough, as the character’s cynical emotions are the opposite of her own. However, this contrast has also made the role fascinating for her. Delving into Mannat’s intricate layers and understanding her motivations has been a key part of Seerat’s process.\n\nTo bring Mannat to life, Seerat has relied heavily on the guidance of her director. She mentioned how her director has played a crucial role in helping her navigate the complexities of Mannat’s character. By offering insights into Mannat’s motivations and helping Seerat understand the character’s darker side, the director has been instrumental in shaping her portrayal. “Often, I would sit with my director, who would guide me through Mannat’s intricate layers, offering insights into her motivations and helping me tap into her darker side. His guidance has been instrumental in shaping my portrayal,” Seerat revealed.\n\nThe experience of playing Mannat has pushed Seerat to explore different aspects of her acting abilities. She has had to dig deep to portray the character’s emotions authentically, which has been both a challenge and a learning opportunity. Seerat expressed gratitude for the chance to bring such a multi-dimensional character to life, as it has allowed her to grow as an actress. She acknowledged that the role has expanded her understanding of acting and provided her with valuable experience in portraying complex emotions on screen.\n\nSeerat’s reflections on both photography and acting highlight her dedication to her craft. Whether behind the camera or in front of it, she approaches her work with passion and a desire to connect with the world around her. Photography, for Seerat, is more than just capturing images; it’s a way of experiencing life more fully and finding peace in the process. Similarly, her role as Mannat has been more than just a job; it’s been a journey of self-discovery and artistic growth.\n\nAs the world celebrates World Photography Day, Seerat’s words remind us of the power of photography to connect us with the present moment and the world around us. Her story also underscores the importance of embracing challenges in our creative endeavors, whether in photography, acting, or any other art form. Through her experiences, Seerat Kapoor exemplifies the idea that art, in all its forms, can be a source of peace, reflection, and growth.\n\nWinners Announced for 70th National Film Awards; Aattam and Rishab Shetty Among Top Honorees\n\nThe winners of the 70th National Film Awards were disclosed at the National Media Center in New Delhi on Friday.

Alongside recognizing the nation’s best films, the awards also celebrate regional cinema and industry legends with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for lifetime achievement, with last year’s award going to Waheeda Rehman.\n\nShah Rukh Khan Honored with Pardo Alla Carriera Award at Locarno Film Festival: A Journey Through Indian Cinema\n\nShah Rukh Khan’s universal appeal knows no bounds, recently resonating at Lake Maggiore, where he was bestowed with the prestigious Pardo Alla Carriera award at the Locarno Film Festival. This accolade recognized Shah Rukh for his substantial contributions to Indian cinema. Following the award ceremony, he engaged in an insightful discussion with the festival’s artistic director, Giona A Nazarro, offering a glimpse into his thoughts and reflections on cinema. The conversation was rich, with Shah Rukh sharing his quick wit and profound understanding of how his mind processes the vast landscape of Indian cinema, encompassing its diverse languages and cultures.\n\nA significant part of the dialogue revolved around the diversity inherent in Indian cinema, which is often misunderstood or oversimplified. Shah Rukh emphasized that Indian cinema cannot be confined to regional categories. He articulated, “Honestly, to regionalise Indian cinema is wrong. The country is so vast that we don’t have different dialects across the nation, but different languages altogether. Be it Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Odia, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati… it is all Indian cinema.” His words underscore the complexity and richness of Indian cinema, which spans multiple languages, each with its own unique storytelling traditions.\n\nHaving collaborated with many prominent figures across these languages, Shah Rukh’s observation was astute and grounded in experience. He remarked, “Some of the best storytelling comes from the South of India. Some of the greatest superstars of Indian cinema are from Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, etc… Of course, we know of them in India, but with films like Jawan, Baahubali, and RRR, everybody is noticing it.” Shah Rukh has often incorporated South Indian technicians into his Hindi films, recognizing their cinematic and technical expertise. He credited his work with Mani Ratnam on the film “Dil Se” for igniting his desire to explore the “South” genre further. However, working with a South Indian director was not enough; Shah Rukh sought to immerse himself deeper into the vibrant and dynamic world of South Indian cinema.\n\nThis desire eventually led to his collaboration with Tamil director Atlee on the film “Jawan.” Shah Rukh explained that different regions of India have distinct approaches to storytelling, with the South known for its grand, larger-than-life narratives. He shared, “South has a larger-than-life approach. It is very robust with a lot of music going on. They love their heroes to be larger-than-life. I really enjoyed acting in such a film. It was very theatrical. It was very colourful, and lovely.” This experience was a new and enriching one for Shah Rukh, who also touched upon the linguistic barriers he faced while working with Atlee. Despite these challenges, they found ways to communicate, often relying on gestures. Shah Rukh recalled, “After a point, we just started gesticulating. Atlee is a wonderful guy, and he was kind enough to name his son after my dad. Whenever I asked him if a take was okay, he would say ‘Mass’. It meant good. It was a lot of shaking of hands, eating idly, dosa, and chilli chicken.”\n\nShah Rukh’s enthusiasm for South Indian cinema was evident as he highlighted the talent involved in “Jawan.” The film featured acclaimed South Indian actors like Vijay Sethupathi and Nayanthara, with editing by Ruben, making it a unique fusion of Hindi and South Indian cinema. “We had some wonderful actors from the South. We had Vijay Sethupathi. We had Nayanthara ji. We had editing by Ruben. In fact, Jawan was the first fusion of Hindi and South Indian cinema that transcended boundaries. People loved the film, and it did a lot of business. Jawan was such a great experience,” he noted. The film’s success is a testament to the growing recognition and appreciation of South Indian cinema on a global scale, driven by its distinctive style and storytelling prowess.\n\nLooking ahead, Shah Rukh Khan revealed his upcoming project, “King,” directed by Sujoy Ghosh. Describing the film as an “age-centric actioner,” Shah Rukh shared that it required him to undergo rigorous training. This project is particularly special as it reportedly marks the first on-screen collaboration between Shah Rukh and his daughter, Suhana Khan, adding a personal touch to the anticipation surrounding the film. Shah Rukh’s continued dedication to his craft and his willingness to embrace new challenges and collaborations illustrate his enduring passion for cinema.\n\nShah Rukh Khan’s presence at the Locarno Film Festival and his receipt of the Pardo Alla Carriera award serve as a reminder of his significant impact on Indian cinema. His reflections on the diversity and richness of Indian cinema, coupled with his own experiences working across different regional industries, highlight the evolving landscape of Indian filmmaking. Shah Rukh’s journey, from his work with Mani Ratnam to his recent collaboration with Atlee, reflects a deepening connection with South Indian cinema and a desire to explore new narratives and cinematic expressions. As he continues to push boundaries and take on new roles, both on and off-screen, Shah Rukh Khan remains a pivotal figure in the ever-expanding world of Indian cinema.\n\nUlajh: A Spy Thriller That Falls Short Despite a Promising Cast\n\nI eagerly anticipated Ulajh, a film starring a promising New Generation actor who seemed finally to have a role that matched her intelligence, supported by a solid and diverse cast. Unfortunately, this spy thriller, mostly set in the cold landscapes of London, ended up being a disappointment.\n\nThe movie begins with the ambitious young diplomat, Suhana Bhatia (Janhvi Kapoor), winning a seemingly losing battle in a neighboring country through a questionable move. The rationale is that it was in India’s best interest, emphasizing Suhana’s cleverness and her ability to think quickly. Her promotion to a prestigious overseas position suggests that this IFS blue-blood — her father Dhanraj (Adil Hussain) is a legendary figure in the service — is on a path to a trailblazing career.\n\nSuhana soon encounters an avuncular chauffeur-cum-factotum (Rajesh Tailang), a suave senior (Alyy Khan), a few critical juniors (Roshan Mathew, Meiyang Chang), and a charming chef (Gulshan Devaiah) who can whip up mouth-watering dishes on the fly.\n\nThen, the narrative takes a drastic turn: an indiscretion makes Suhana an easy target for the ISI (where there are patriotic Indians, how far behind can the sinister Pakistani secret service be), and suspicion starts to circle her, tightening the noose. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, a peacenik Prime Minister (Rushad Rana) is preparing for a visit to India. Will everything go as planned, or will it end in disaster? Are Suhana’s increasingly desperate colleagues innocent or complicit? Will she manage to extricate herself from the tightening grip?\n\nThe spy genre is well-worn territory, but there’s always room for a sleek film with characters who convincingly portray their conflicted beliefs and questionable actions. In *Ulajh*, however, believability is sacrificed for contrived situations and artificiality. How does Suhana, who is depicted as having sharp instincts from the start, fall for the oldest trick in the book? Why are her interactions with the mentor she idolizes so stiffly written? How does an antagonistic colleague suddenly switch sides in an instant?\n\nThese issues are particularly disappointing because Ulajh features a talented ensemble cast, yet they are left to fumble through an amateurish plot. The problem with Hindi films where heroines lead from the front is apparent in how Kapoor is positioned front and center, even when her character should have known better: sometimes she should step aside and let the experts do their jobs. When the lead is elevated at the expense of other characters, who feel underdeveloped, the film as a whole suffers.\n\nUlajh stars Janhvi Kapoor, Roshan Mathew, Gulshan Devaiah, Adil Hussain, Rajesh Tailang, Meiyang Chang, Rajendra Gupta, Alyy Khan, Jitendra Joshi, and Rushad Rana. The film is directed by Sudhanshu Saria and earns a rating of 2 stars.\n\nDhanush’s Raayan: A Cinematic Triumph with Unfulfilled Potential\n\nRaayan is a significant film, marking Dhanush’s 50th project and one where he takes the director’s chair, showcasing his vision and prowess. Unlike typical milestones, Dhanush fully embraces this moment, focusing on creating a cinematic experience centered around his multifaceted skills. Despite being the star, Dhanush’s character, Kathavaraayan, remains in the background initially, letting his siblings shine. Muthuvelraayan (Sundeep Kishan) and Manickavelraayan (Kalidas Jayaram) have powerful entrances, while their sister, Durga (Dushara Vijayan), stands out as the backbone of the family. In contrast, Dhanush’s introduction is subtle, depicted as simply cooking fried rice, hinting at deeper layers to his character.\n\nThe film opens with a beautifully shot black-and-white flashback, establishing why the eldest Raayan brings his siblings to the city, seeking a better life. The younger versions of the Raayan brothers set the stage for a gripping revenge drama. As the family navigates through life amidst gang wars involving Durai (Saravanan) and Sethu (SJ Suryah), and a cunning cop (Prakash Raj), tension builds, leaving the audience to wonder when the true Raayan will emerge.\n\nThe Raayan household, much like their lives, is unfinished and in need of repair, symbolizing their ongoing struggles. The first half of the film is dedicated to setting up the characters and their dynamics, with Dhanush’s character remaining a mystery. Manickavelraayan’s desire to step out of his brothers’ shadows and Muthu’s hot temper are focal points, driving the narrative forward. However, once Kathavaraayan steps in to protect his family, the film risks becoming a typical revenge story. A twist reinvigorates the plot but also exposes some of the film’s shortcomings, leaving the audience questioning the depth of the characters.\n\nDespite attempts to develop these characters through scattered dialogues, there is a sense that we never fully understand them. Interestingly, the less explored characters make a more lasting impact. Dushara Vijayan’s performance stands out, driving the narrative with her compelling portrayal. Selvaraghavan as the guardian angel and Aparna Balamurali, who delivers the film’s pivotal dialogue, add significant value. Devadarshini, in a brief role, makes a striking impact. SJ Suryah, in a restrained role, excels but is limited by some writing choices that prevent his character from being as menacing as intended. These writing choices, along with a few others, hinder the film from reaching its full potential as a compelling family drama. The explosive confrontations between characters, although visually impactful, lack the emotional depth to make a lasting impression.\n\nWhat truly elevates Raayan is Dhanush’s direction and the cohesive effort of the entire production team. The film benefits from precise staging, allowing the characters to breathe and reflect in quieter moments. Editor GK Prasanna and cinematographer Om Prakash enhance the film’s visual appeal, especially in complex scenes where every movement is clear and purposeful. Prabhudeva and Baba Baskar’s choreography adds style without compromising raw emotion, while Peter Hein’s stunt choreography is impactful without overstaying its welcome. AR Rahman’s score ties everything together, enhancing the film’s atmosphere and elevating it to another level. “Isn’t this the Rahman we have been wanting for a while now?”\n\nDespite these strengths, Raayan falls short of soaring to its full potential. The film boasts excellent performances from a talented cast and a top-notch technical team. The premise holds promise for a no-holds-barred revenge drama, but the film pulls back at crucial moments, diluting its impact. This restraint leaves some performances feeling underutilized, some of the violence feeling unnecessary, and the overall experience somewhat hollow. In the end, the lingering question is: What could Raayan have been?\n\nTrouble in Paradise: Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Headed for Divorce?\n\nRumors of a split between Bollywood power couple Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai are gaining traction. This speculation intensified following their recent separate public appearances. Abhishek was seen at a high-profile wedding with his family—father Amitabh, mother Jaya, sister Shweta Bachchan Nanda, and her family—while Aishwarya arrived later with their daughter Aaradhya.\n\nFurther fueling these rumors, Abhishek liked an Instagram post about the rising number of divorce cases, shared by a journalist. This action did not go unnoticed by vigilant social media users.\n\nThe Social Media Post\n\nThe post that caught Abhishek’s attention was titled, “When love stops being easy.” The accompanying caption elaborated, “Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things?”\n\nThis like from Abhishek only added to the swirling rumors about his and Aishwarya’s relationship status.\n\nSeparate Public Appearances\n\nThe couple’s separate appearances at the recent wedding of an Indian billionaire’s son, attended by numerous celebrities, added fuel to the fire. Abhishek and Aishwarya have not been seen together for some time now, further intensifying the divorce rumors.\n\nA Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan married on April 20, 2007, in a grand ceremony. The couple welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011. Over the years, they have been regarded as one of Bollywood’s most iconic couples.\n\nAbhishek’s Upcoming Projects\n\nIn terms of his professional life, Abhishek Bachchan has several upcoming projects. He will be seen in the Shah Rukh Khan film “King,” where he is expected to play a negative role. This film will also reportedly feature Shah Rukh’s daughter, Suhana Khan, and is likely to be directed by Sujoy Ghosh.\n\nAdditionally, Abhishek will appear in “Housefull 5,” a star-studded comedy that includes Akshay Kumar, Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Riteish Deshmukh, and Chunky Pandey in significant roles.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the rumors of a split between Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai continue to circulate, neither has made an official statement regarding the status of their relationship. The public and media remain watchful, hoping for clarity from the couple who have been a significant part of Bollywood’s narrative for over a decade.\n\n69th SOBHA Filmfare Awards South 2024 Nominations Announced: Celebrating Excellence Across South Indian Cinema\n\nThe nominations for the 69th SOBHA Filmfare Awards South 2024 were unveiled on Tuesday, encompassing talents from Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam cinema.

Hariharan explores Kamal Haasan’s evolution across 50-plus films, showcasing his ability to challenge stereotypes and push boundaries. Here are some lesser-known facts from the screen legend’s incredible journey from the audiobook:\n\nWhen veteran producer L.V. Prasad screened ‘Ek Duje Ke Liye’ for the first time, it was a disaster.\n\nKamal Haasan bridged the north-south divide in India and made inroads into the Hindi film industry with ‘Ek Duuje Ke Liye’ (1981), which was what we would now call a pan-India film. Despite the initial setbacks and sceptical distributors in Mumbai, the film eventually was greeted with packed cinemas and emotional reactions.\n\nThe audience response took the veteran producer L.V. Prasad by complete surprise. In the words of Hariharan, “Prasad realised that everyone had seen a wholesome tragedy after a long time on the Hindi screen and there was no difference in feelings between the Tamil and Hindi audiences … he immediately called his son to order another 40 prints to be released all over India the following Friday.”\n\nThe film went on to celebrate 50 weeks in the theatres (a golden jubilee in the terminology that was current then) and the rest is history.\n\nShah Rukh Khan did not charge a paisa for his role in ‘Hey Ram’.\n\nKamal Haasan’s journey with ‘Hey Ram’ (2000) began with an idea akin to a crime thriller, but he soon realized that empathizing with Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse, would be too reactionary.\n\n“I changed it around completely and made the story get some respect for the protagonist. Undoubtedly, the film got me a lot of respect, but it flopped,” Kamal Haasan tells Hariharan. Shah Rukh Khan, however, “was so impressed by the vision of the film that he refused to charge a penny for his performance as Amjad, instead deeming it an honour to get an opportunity to work with a legend like Kamal.”\n\nSilent comedy ‘Pushpak’ was certified by the Censor Board multiple times in the same year in all Indian languages.\n\nInspired by the legacy of Charlie Chaplin, Kamal Haasan’s ‘Pushpak’ (1987) redefined silent comedy for Indian audiences. In the audiobook, Hariharan shares that the film’s release strategy was quite complex because of the absence of dialogue.\n\n“The rule says that a talkie has to be in a certain language,” explains Hariharan. “In order to release this wordless film all over India, it was certified the same year by the Censor Board multiple times, in all Indian languages, with titles being changed and new censor certificates issued in all languages!”\n\n‘Sathya’ almost got shelved because of Kamal Haasan’s financial difficulties.\n\nThe 1988 movie ‘Sathya’ was a bold move as it was the remake of the 1985 Bollywood hit ‘Arjun’, scripted by Javed Akhtar. Suresh Krishnaa was the director of the Tamil film and Kamal’s production house was helming the project. Kamal demonstrated his remarkable acting prowess, says Hariharan, but the film’s production faced a number of challenges.\n\n“Kamal’s second production, a big-budget sci-fi venture titled ‘Vikram’ suffered on both critical and commercial fronts. His company had to comfort the distributors who had shouldered the risk of such an ambitious film,” writes Hariharan. But the film did well on all counts. With a stellar musical score by Ilaiyaraaja and Kamal’s relentless dedication, ‘Sathya’ became a defining film resonating deeply with audiences. (IANS)\n\nLucky Baskhar Gets New Release Date\n\nThe much-anticipated film “Lucky Baskhar,” directed by Venky Atluri, has a new release date. Initially slated to hit theaters on September 27, the film will now be released on September 7, coinciding with the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Dulquer Salmaan, the lead actor, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share this update with fans.\n\nAnnouncement by Dulquer Salmaan\n\nDulquer Salmaan announced the new release date on X, accompanied by a fresh still from the movie. He wrote, “This Vinayaka Chaturthi, Get ready to experience #LuckyBaskhar’s unforgettable journey on the Big Screens! Worldwide Grand Release on 7th SEPT in Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil & Hindi Languages. #LuckyBaskharOnSept7th.” This announcement has generated significant excitement among fans eagerly awaiting the film’s release.\n\nOriginal Release Plans and Changes\n\nOriginally, “Lucky Baskhar” was set to premiere on September 27, alongside Sujeeth’s Pawan Kalyan-starrer “They Call Him OG.” However, due to delays in wrapping up “They Call Him OG,” caused by Pawan Kalyan’s political engagements, the release of “Lucky Baskhar” has been advanced. This move is expected to benefit the film by avoiding a direct clash at the box office.\n\nTeaser Release and Storyline\n\nIn April, Dulquer Salmaan released the teaser for “Lucky Baskhar,” providing a glimpse into the film’s plot. The teaser portrays Baskhar as a bored banker working at the fictional Magadha Bank. He is depicted as a ‘common, middle-class, Indian man’ who is weary of his monotonous daily routine. This includes waking up, getting dressed, dealing with traffic, and performing his repetitive job, only to fall asleep at work. The teaser hints at a significant turning point when Baskhar stumbles upon a large sum of money, raising curiosity about how he acquired it. Meenakshi Chaudhary plays the role of the woman Baskhar loves, adding a romantic angle to the story.\n\nSetting and Production Details\n\n“Lucky Baskhar” is set against the backdrop of the late 1980s to early 1990s, focusing on the life of a bank cashier during that era. The filmmakers went to great lengths to recreate the period accurately. The shooting was completed in Hyderabad, where the production team constructed sets resembling Bombay of the 80s. This included building a bank that mirrors those from that time. Such meticulous attention to detail was aimed at ensuring authenticity in the portrayal of the era.\n\nCast and Crew\n\nMeenakshi Chaudhary stars alongside Dulquer Salmaan in the film. The music for “Lucky Baskhar” has been composed by GV Prakash Kumar, adding to the film’s nostalgic feel. The production is handled by Naga Vamsi and Sai Soujanya under the banners of Sitara Entertainments and Fortune Four Cinemas. Srikara Studios is presenting the film.\n\nBanglan, the production designer, conducted extensive research to bring authenticity to the sets, ensuring that the visual elements accurately reflect the period in which the film is set. Cinematographer Nimish Ravi played a crucial role in bringing director Venky Atluri’s vision to life through his camera work, capturing the essence of the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nMultilingual Release\n\n“Lucky Baskhar” will be released in four languages: Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi. This multilingual release strategy aims to reach a broader audience across different regions, reflecting the diverse linguistic landscape of India.\n\nA.R. Rahman’s Documentary ‘Headhunting to Beatboxing’ to Premiere at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne 2024\n\nOscar and Grammy award-winning composer A. R. Rahman’s documentary, “Headhunting to Beatboxing,” directed by Rohit Gupta, is set to have its world premiere at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) 2024 in Australia.\n\nRahman expressed his excitement about the film’s premiere, stating, “The film is very special to us, as it throws light on the beautiful state of Nagaland and highlights the rich cultural and musical history it contains. Rohit and I are looking forward to the premiere and showcasing it to the audiences in Melbourne.”\n\n“Headhunting to Beatboxing” explores the journey of rhythm and sound in Nagaland, highlighting the evolution of music across various cultures, tribes, and generations. The film is also competing for the Best Documentary Film at the festival.\n\nGupta shared his thoughts on the documentary’s significance, saying, “I feel the narrative holds global relevance, along with the incredible healing power of music. The film has been painstakingly made in over five years and I am excited to see the audience’s reactions to it and for them to explore the rich cultural and musical tapestry of Nagaland. Especially to hear a completely new sound coming from India.”\n\nThis documentary marks Rahman’s second major venture into filmmaking as a producer, following his earlier production, “99 Songs,” which premiered at the Busan International Film Festival.\n\nIFFM Festival director Mitu Bhowmick Lange commented on the documentary’s selection, stating, “When we saw the documentary, we knew there was something special to it. We are delighted to have the world premiere of the film at IFFM and have Dr Rahman and filmmaker Rohit Gupta present it to our audiences.”\n\nThe film has been directed by Rohit Gupta and produced by A. R. Rahman, with Abu Metha, Adam J. Greig, Theja Meru, Rohit Gupta, Sheila Houlahan, and Rohhit Daas serving as Executive Producers.\n\nThe Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, which is set to celebrate its 15th year, will commence on August 15 and conclude on August 25. This annual celebration is presented by the Victorian Government.\n\nThe Film ‘Maharaj’ Echoes the Story of Its Historical Subject\n\nIn the 1860s, journalist and social reformer Karsandas Mulji faced legal challenges after exposing the sexual misconduct of a powerful religious leader. Over 150 years later, a film based on his life, **Maharaj**, starring Aamir Khan’s son Junaid, faced a similar fate. The film’s release was delayed by a petition from a religious sect, accompanied by boycott calls on social media. On June 21, just a week after its scheduled release on Netflix, the Gujarat High Court lifted the stay, ruling, “Having viewed the film, this court found nothing objectionable that would hurt the religious feelings of petitioners or a sect.”\n\n**Maharaj** draws from Saurabh Shah’s 2013 Gujarati novel, narrating the 1862 Maharaj libel case, where British judges in colonial India arbitrated between religious conservatism and progressive reform. Karsandas, editor of the Gujarati weekly **Satyaprakash**, was sued for defamation by Jadunathji, a high priest of the influential Pushtimarga sect. The case, fought in the Supreme Court of Bombay, garnered significant public attention. Karsandas successfully defended himself but incurred expenses that outweighed his awarded compensation.\n\nDirector Karan P Malhotra shifts the courtroom events to the film’s climax, a choice that avoids the often exaggerated portrayals in Hindi period dramas. Instead, the film focuses on the conflict between Karsandas (Junaid Khan) and Jadunath (Jaideep Ahlawat), known as JJ to his followers. JJ, a charismatic figure, exploits the vulnerability of female devotees. Karsandas, a Vaishnavite himself, resists JJ’s influence, challenging superstitious practices while maintaining his faith.\n\nIn the film, Karsandas emerges as a beacon of virtue in a conservative society, advocating for widow remarriage and interacting with ‘untouchables.’ His crusade against JJ intensifies after his fiancée, Kishori (Shalini Pandey), a victim of JJ, commits suicide following Karsandas’s decision to break off their engagement. Realizing his error in focusing on her “honor” instead of supporting her emancipation, Karsandas becomes a 19th-century male savior. The film is predominantly about men debating women’s rights, with a late entry by Viraaj (Sharvari Wagh) providing some balance as she joins Karsandas in his mission.\n\nEarly in the film, a narrator describes Bombay as “more a concept than a city,” highlighting the era’s conflicting ideas. The film portrays the reformist zeal of figures like Karsandas and Dadabhai Naoroji against the backdrop of JJ’s influence and the common masses’ confusion. Despite set-like production designs, Rajeev Ravi’s cinematography adds a painterly charm to the film.\n\nMaharaj clearly depicts JJ’s powerful hold over his community. He is described as having become “the face of the sect,” drawing wealthy patrons and consolidating power. The film criticizes blind faith and personality cults while unifying portrayals of religion. When JJ bans temple visits to force an apology from Karsandas, the young reformer leads an aarti under a peepal tree with a picture of Lord Krishna. The film later echoes the Janmashtami story with an imperiled couple being ferried to safety.\n\nJunaid Khan delivers a sincere performance as Karsandas but falls short of becoming a captivating lead, especially in courtroom scenes. Jaideep Ahlawat’s portrayal of JJ is effortlessly villainous, contrasting sharply with Junaid’s earnestness. Their confrontation in the rain underscores the difference in their performances. Sharvari Wagh brings charm and spunk to her limited scenes, and Jay Upadhyay is notable as JJ’s scheming assistant.\n\nThe film’s release faced significant challenges, reflecting current sensitivities. Earlier this year, the Tamil film **Annapoorani** was pulled from Netflix following right-wing complaints of religious offense. **Maharaj**, though simple and sedate, might have gone unnoticed if not for these sensitivities. Its release without promotions or a trailer highlights the caution of streaming platforms today, underscoring the non-linear path of progress.\n\nMaharaj (Hindi)\n\n– Director:Karan P Malhotra\n\n– Cast: Junaid Khan, Jaideep Ahlawat, Shalini Pandey, Sharvari Wagh, Jay Upadhyay\n\n– Runtime: 131 minutes\n\n– Storyline:The real-life story of a journalist in 1860s Bombay and his crusade against a powerful, lecherous godman\n\nOverall, Maharaj reflects the complex interplay between tradition and reform in colonial India, mirroring the historical events it depicts and the contemporary reactions it provoked.\n\nVinod Ganatra Honored with Nelson Mandela Lifetime Achievement Award for Contributions to Children’s Cinema\n\nMumbai– Vinod Ganatra, a highly-regarded filmmaker and editor originally from Gujarat and now based in Mumbai, has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Indian recipient of South Africa’s prestigious ‘Nelson Mandela Lifetime Achievement Award’ for his remarkable contributions to cinema, particularly in the realm of children’s films.\n\nAccording to an official announcement made here on Tuesday, Ganatra was honored with this esteemed award during the 7th Nelson Mandela Children’s Film Festival, in recognition of his extensive body of work that has left a lasting impact on the world of cinema for young audiences.\n\nThe accolade adds to Ganatra’s already illustrious career, which spans over three decades and includes a total of 36 national and international awards.

Sania shared her thoughts humorously and candidly, providing an interesting perspective on the idea.\n\nKapil Sharma noted that Mary Kom had Priyanka Chopra portray her in a 2014 biopic, and Parineeti Chopra played Saina Nehwal in 2021. When asked who she would prefer to play her in a film, Sania joked, “Inki koi behen bachi hain? (Are there any sisters left?)” She continued, “No, I think we have many good actors in our country. Anyone is fine. Or maybe I should play myself.”\n\nKapil further mentioned that Shah Rukh Khan had once expressed interest in playing Sania’s love interest if a biopic were made. This prompted a momentary awkwardness for Sania, considering her recent divorce from cricketer Shoaib Malik. Lightening the mood, she responded, “But I need to find a love interest first.” When Kapil asked if she would act in her biopic if Shah Rukh starred in it, she said, “If Shah Rukh ji does the film, I might play myself. And I’ll definitely do it if Akshay Kumar is in it.”\n\nKapil also inquired how Sania managed to get Swiss tennis player Martina Hingis to be her doubles partner, jesting if it was through Hyderabadi biryani. Sania replied humorously, “I took Farah (Khan) along, and she fed us biryani.”\n\nSania Mirza’s admiration for Akshay Kumar has been evident over the years. In 2014, Akshay attended one of her International Premier Tennis League (ITPL) matches, along with celebrities like Deepika Padukone and Aamir Khan. During the pandemic in 2020, when Sania was in India and Shoaib Malik was in Pakistan, they had a ‘virtual date’ over Instagram live. During a game of “Ditch and Marry,” Shoaib asked her to choose between Tom Cruise and Akshay Kumar. Sania’s response highlighted her long-standing admiration: “I’ve liked Akshay Kumar since Mohra days. I’m not gonna ditch him. When nobody liked Akshay, I liked Akshay.”\n\nThe conversation with Kapil Sharma also touched on Sania and Shoaib Malik’s divorce. After months of speculation, Shoaib and Sana Javed posted their wedding photos on Instagram on January 19, 2024. Sania’s family confirmed the separation, stating that she and Shoaib had been divorced for a few months. The family’s statement read, “Sania has always kept her personal life away from the public eye. However, today the need has arisen for her to share that Shoaib and she have been divorced for a few months now. She wishes Shoaib well for his new journey ahead.”\n\nThe playful exchange on “The Great Indian Kapil Show” provided insights into Sania Mirza’s life and career, mixing light-hearted moments with personal revelations. It showcased Sania’s sense of humor, her openness about her personal life, and her deep admiration for Akshay Kumar, adding a relatable and humanizing touch to the sports star’s public persona.\n\nSanya Malhotra Clinches Best Actress Award at New York Indian Film Festival for ‘Mrs’ Role, Highlighting Rising Talent and Captivating Storytelling\n\nSanya Malhotra has secured the Best Actress award at the esteemed New York Indian Film Festival 2024 for her performance in the film ‘Mrs’.\n\nDirected by Arati Kadav, ‘Mrs’ is reportedly the Hindi adaptation of the highly praised Malayalam movie, ‘The Great Indian Kitchen’.

This award is the second highest honor after the Palme d’Or.\n\nKapadia’s film, “All We Imagine As Light,” is a drama about two Malayali nurses who move to a beautifully depicted Mumbai, exploring themes of life, love, and sisterhood. Remarkably, it is the first Indian film in three decades to compete in the main competition at Cannes.\n\n“It was already a dream to be selected in competition and this was beyond my imagination,” Kapadia said in her acceptance speech, addressing the Cannes jury, which included director Greta Gerwig and actor Lily Gladstone. She added, “Please don’t wait another 30 years to have an Indian film,” eliciting applause from the audience.\n\nThe victory has caused a wave of celebration across India, with numerous people, including top politicians, acknowledging its significance on social media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his pride on X, saying, “Her remarkable talent continues to shine on the global stage, giving a glimpse of the rich creativity in India. This prestigious accolade not only honors her exceptional skills but also inspires a new generation of Indian filmmakers.”\n\nRahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, along with Anasuya Sengupta, the first Indian actor to win Best Actress for her role in “The Shameless” in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section, also congratulated Kapadia. Gandhi noted, “Indian stars shining bright… These women have scripted history, and inspired the entire Indian film fraternity.”\n\nSooni Taraporevala, a screenwriter known for “Salaam Bombay!” which won the Camera d’Or at Cannes in 1988, commented to CNN on the significance of Kapadia’s “unprecedented” win. She emphasized that it “has personally touched women and those in the indie film space,” adding that it has “allowed us to dream and hope and celebrate her with unabashed pride and joy,” especially in an industry often dominated by mainstream productions.\n\n“All We Imagine As Light” received an eight-minute standing ovation at its festival premiere, a testament to its powerful storytelling and emotional impact. The film’s portrayal of the romance between the protagonist Prabha (played by Kani Kusruti) and her Muslim boyfriend (Hridhu Haroon) is particularly bold, reflecting the country’s increasing polarization along religious lines.\n\nDespite being the largest film-producing country in the world, India has often struggled to achieve the same level of international recognition and accolades as Hollywood. However, there have been notable successes. Last year, the Telegu-language historical fantasy “RRR” became the first Indian feature film to win an Oscar for best original song with its catchy and vibrant “Naatu Naatu.” Additionally, “The Elephant Whisperers,” directed by Kartiki Gonsalves, won the Oscar for best documentary short.\n\nIndia’s cinematic achievements at Cannes have a storied history. In 1947, filmmaker Chetan Anand won Cannes’ top prize for his film “Neecha Nagar,” making him the only Indian to win that accolade until now.\n\nKapadia’s earlier work has also been celebrated at Cannes. In 2021, she won the festival’s L’Oeil d’Or award for her documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing,” which follows a film student in India as she tries to maintain a relationship with her ex despite the challenges posed by their different castes.\n\nThis latest win by Kapadia at Cannes marks a significant moment not only for her career but also for Indian cinema as a whole. It highlights the rich narrative and artistic capabilities of Indian filmmakers and sets a new precedent for future generations. The global recognition of her film underscores the importance of diverse storytelling and the universal appeal of well-crafted cinema.\n\nIndia’s Cinematic Influence: How Bollywood Shapes Political Narratives in the World’s Largest Democracy\n\nAs India, the world’s largest democracy, heads to the polls, political parties are leveraging popular culture, particularly cinema, to influence voters. Historically, Indian films have both mirrored and shaped the nation’s political and social landscapes, but currently, Bollywood and regional films significantly bolster the ruling right-wing government.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is aiming for a third consecutive term in office. The BJP, founded as the political branch of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) — a paramilitary volunteer organization — is one of India’s two main political parties. With 80 percent of India’s population being Hindu, the BJP posits that India is inherently a Hindu nation. Their platform has resonated widely, partly because they portray India as a formidable post-colonial power. In contrast, the main opposition, the Indian National Congress, advocates secularism. During his campaign last month, Prime Minister Modi gave a speech that faced widespread criticism for being Islamophobic.\n\nIn a recent episode of the podcast Don’t Call Me Resilient, political scientist Sikata Banerjee from the University of Victoria and cinema studies scholar Rakesh Sengupta from the University of Toronto discuss how cinema and social media help propagate ideas that include “a vicious vocabulary of hate against minorities and dissenters” in India, potentially swaying voter opinions.\n\n“In Modi’s India, when people are asking these questions, why am I poor? Why am I feeling so worthless? The answer is always the Muslims,” says Banerjee. “The Muslims have taken away your wealth. They’re taking all the jobs…You see very clearly how Modi is getting people on board with this idea of the Hindu imagined community.”\n\nThis blend of Islamophobia and modern Hindu pride has penetrated Bollywood, the world’s largest film industry, producing around 1,500-2,000 films annually. These films have promoted the vision of a reimagined, strong, and triumphant India. This narrative is further amplified by streaming platforms and social media such as YouTube and WhatsApp, which have even broader reach than traditional Bollywood films.\n\nAn example of this trend is last year’s ‘Tollywood’ movie RRR, which received accolades at the Oscars. RRR retells historical events from the perspective of the current “victors.” Another film accused of distorting history is Swatantra Veer Savarkar, which focuses on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the originator of the Hindu nationalist ideology of Hindutva.\n\nSengupta from the University of Toronto explains that the interplay between cinema and the state in India has always been historically significant. “You can always historically see a kind of reflection of the state of a particular time in the cinema of that time,” he notes. “Under the current regime of Hindu nationalism, we are witnessing more and more films being made on Hindu pride and Muslim violence.”\n\nThe election process in India began on April 19 and spans seven phases, concluding on June 1, 2024.\n\nMammootty Sends Birthday Wishes to Mohanlal as Icon Turns 64\n\nRenowned actor Mohanlal, a beloved figure in Kerala, commemorates his 64th birthday today.\n\nMohanlal’s journey to stardom wasn’t paved with privilege but rather with relentless effort, unwavering dedication, and a profound commitment to his craft. Beginning his career in 1978, it wasn’t until two years later that he embarked on his full-fledged cinematic journey. Despite being initially cast as a villain in the 1980 hit “Manjil Virinja Pookal,” his career soared swiftly, solidifying his status as a superstar. Currently, at the age of 64, he is engaged in his 360th Malayalam film, yet to be named, where he reunites with Shobana for the 56th time.\n\nOn this auspicious occasion, Mohanlal’s longtime colleague, Mammootty, extended his heartfelt wishes, accompanied by a delightful picture capturing a tender moment between the two. Well-wishes have begun flooding in from various quarters as the actor celebrates his 64th milestone, coinciding with the anticipation surrounding his directorial debut, “Barroz.”\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Mohanlal has amassed numerous accolades, including five National Awards, encompassing two Best Actor awards, a Special Jury mention, and a Special Jury award for his acting prowess and production excellence.
