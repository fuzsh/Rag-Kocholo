        "text": "Career\n\nDilip Kumar's first film Jwar Bhata (1944) went unnoticed, it was Jugnu (1947) in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan that became his first major hit at the box office. He got his breakthrough role with Mehboob Khan's Andaz (1949) in which he starred alongside Raj Kapoor and Nargis in a love triangle story. He went on to have success in the 1950s with playing tragic roles in films like Jogan (1950), Deedar (1951), Daag (1952), Devdas (1955), Yahudi (1958) and Madhumati (1958). These films established his screen image as the \"Tragedy King\". He was the first actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award for Daag and went onto win it again for Devdas. He formed popular on-screen pairings with many of the top actresses at the time including Nargis, Kamini Kaushal, Meena Kumari, Madhubala and Vyjanthimala.\n\nIn an attempt to shed his \"tragedy king\" image, Dilip Kumar took up his psychiatrist's suggestion that he take on lighthearted roles such as Aan (1952), his first film in technicolour in which he played a swashbuckling peasant. He has further success with lighter roles in Azaad (1955), Naya Daur (1957) and Kohinoor (1960) which won him the Filmfare Best Actor Award once again. In 1960 he portrayed Prince Salim in K. Asif's big-budget historical film Mughal-e-Azam which as of 2008 was the second highest grossing film in Hindi film history. The film told the story of Prince Salim who revolts against his father Akbar (played by Prithviraj Kapoor) and falls in love with a courtesan (played by Madhubala). The film was mostly shot in black and white with only the latter half of the film in colour. 44 years after its original release, it was fully colourized and re-released in 2004.\n\nIn 1961 he produced and starred in Ganga Jamuna in which he and his brother Nasir Khan played the title roles, this was the only film he produced. In 1962 British director David Lean offered him the role of \"Sherif Ali\" in his film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), but Dilip Kumar declined to perform in the movie. The role eventually went to Omar Sharif, the Egyptian actor. His next film Leader (1964) was a below average grosser at the box office. In 1967 Dilip Kumar played a dual role of twins separated at birth in the hit film Ram Aur Shyam. His career slumped in the 1970s with films like Dastaan (1972) and Bairaag (1976), the latter in which he played triple roles failing at the box office. He starred alongside his real-life wife Saira Banu in Gopi (1970), Bengali film Sagina Mahato (1970) and Bairaag (1976) but all three failed to do well at the box office. He took a five year hiatus from films from 1976 to 1981.\n\nIn 1981, he returned to films with the multi-starrer Kranti which was the biggest hit of the year. Appearing alongside an ensemble cast including Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha, he played the title role as a revolutionary fighting for India's independence from British rule. He then formed a successful collaboration with Subhash Ghai starting with Vidhaata (1982) in which he plays an underworld don who tries to hide his lifestyle from his grandson Kunal (Sanjay Dutt). Later that year he played the father of Amitabh Bachchan in Ramesh Sippy's Shakti for which he won yet another Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 1984 he starred in Yash Chopra's Mashaal and Ramesh Talwar's Duniya.\n\nHis second collaboration with Subhash Ghai came with the 1986 action film Karma. In this film, Kumar plays a jailor who hires three men to help him avenge his family's death by escaped terrorist Doctor Dang (played by Anupam Kher). In 1991, he starred alongside veteran actor Raaj Kumar in Saudagar, his third and last film with Subhash Ghai. This was his second film with Raaj Kumar after 1959's Paigham. Saudagar was Kumar's last box office success and also his last film for several years. In 1993 he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. He was attached to make his directorial debut with a film titled Kalinga but the film was eventually shelved.\n\nIn 1998 he made his last film appearance in Qila where he played dual roles as an evil landowner who is murdered and his twin brother who tries to find his killer. In 2001 he was set to appear in a film titled Asar - The Impact alongside Ajay Devgan which was also shelved. His films Mughal-e-Azam and Naya Daur were fully colorized and re-released in 2004 and 2008 respectively."
